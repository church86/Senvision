Read more about the stories in today's news: Google Unveils Pixel, Pixel XL Phones, Plus Daydream View VR Headset Federal Agencies Working With States to Guard Voter Data Security Intel Starts Sampling Stratix 10 FPGA Accelerators Microsoft Squeezes Power BI Reports Into Smartphone Screens       Today's topics include Google's unveiling of its new Pixel smartphones and Daydream View VR headset, the Department of Homeland Security's effort to protect voter registration data, Intel's release of its Stratix 10 FPGAs and Microsoft's move to make it easier to use Power BI on smartphones. Google's long-rumored Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, as well as its all-new Daydream View VR headset, were finally unveiled Oct. 4 after months of speculation, bringing new entries to both markets from the giant in online search. The smartphones, which were designed and engineered by Google, are available immediately for preorder, starting at $649 for the Pixel phone, which has a 5-inch display and 32GB of onboard storage, and at $769 for a Pixel XL, which has a 5.5-inch display and 32GB of storage. The new Daydream View virtual reality headset is priced at $79 and will arrive in November. At launch, users will be able to view YouTube videos, Google Street View content, Google Play Movies and more. Voter registration officials in 21 states have contacted the Department of Homeland Security to request help in dealing with attempts to break into their voter registration systems. Responding to a letter sent from the bipartisan leadership of the House and Senate, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson reiterated his earlier messages about the willingness of his department to help states deal with cyber-attacks aimed at the voting process. So far, 20 states have experienced intrusions of sufficient severity that are considered causes for concern by DHS. The department has not said which states have been attacked. This is a significant increase since earlier this year, when only two states had reported being attacked. At this point, there are few details about what the hackers were after, although in most cases it appears it was voter registration databases rather than voting machines or the IT systems that support voting results. Intel has begun sampling its Stratix 10 programmable chips, which the company expects to use as accelerators in data center environments running compute- and data-intensive applications. In a blog post Oct. 4, Dan McNamara, corporate vice president and general manager of Intel's Programmable Solutions Group, wrote that company engineers were able to combine the chip maker's 14-nanometer tri-gate manufacturing process with its HyperFlex fabric architecture. This allowed them to develop a field-programmable gate array that will address the growing demands from end users for more performance and power efficiency as they try to manage the proliferation of smart, connected devices and the huge amounts of data they're producing. Intel is aiming the Stratix 10 FGPAs at such workloads as data center applications, cloud computing, radar and imaging systems, and network infrastructure. Power BI reports are getting a mobile makeover. What looks good on a desktop browser doesn't always translate well to mobile displays, and so Web developers are adopting responsive designs and other mobile optimizations that help content shine despite the cramped quarters. Microsoft is following suit with a preview of a new mobile viewing mode for reports authored on the company's cloud-powered business intelligence platform, Power BI. Once a user publishes a report using the Power BI Desktop client, the service automatically scales and resizes its various elements, enabling them to render properly on a variety of mobile screen sizes.       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

Blog What Makes a Good Manager for Engineers? Tom Lacey, CEO, Tessera Technologies 10/5/2016 02:26 PM EDT  5 comments   post a comment NO RATINGS 2 saves Login to Rate Tweet Over my 30-plus years in the semiconductor industry, I've had the opportunity to learn and work for some great managers, manage exceptional people and build stellar teams. Here's what I've learned. It’s often been said that businesses don’t fail, leaders do. Creating a company with strong leadership and management can be the difference between winning and losing in the market. Over my 30-plus years in the semiconductor industry, I’ve had the opportunity to learn and work for some great managers, manage exceptional people and build stellar teams. I was fortunate to spend 14 of my more than 30 years in tech as an employee and senior executive at Intel. Although not my direct manager, Andy Grove’s influence and strong management culture permeated all aspects of Intel. I learned a lot from that strong workplace culture, but five things really stuck with me and helped me a great deal in my post-Intel career (including being a 3-time public company CEO) as I built world-class, high-performing organizations: 1)   Hire great people that offer diversity in thought and skills and continue to develop them. If people aren’t up to the job requirements and if performance management hasn’t worked — upgrade your team. Absolutely do not accept mediocrity. World-class companies and organizations are comprised of world-class people. Managers shouldn’t micromanage – it isn’t necessary if you have great people, and is an indicator of a subpar team. 2)   Have absolute clarity of roles and responsibilities. Make sure people know exactly what is expected of them and let them excel. 3)   Use data to make decisions wherever possible. It is straight math … by making data-based decisions, one makes the right calls more frequently. 4)   Have an open workplace culture that encourages people to speak up and to address problems quickly. Every single company has problems… the better companies solve the small problems before they become big problems. In some cases, managers are the last one to see or hear about a problem, thus it is necessary that people throughout the company are comfortable highlighting problems (and ideally suggest recommendations to address them). 5)   Leaders are role models. They have very high expectations of themselves and continue to raise the bar. People very closely watch the way managers walk, talk and act. Managers should always be aware that their actions and words have the power to either positively or negatively impact their employees. These five lessons have helped shape my viewpoint on management and what I look for when building teams.   Good managers build high performing organization that consistently delivers world-class results. They know that to build a well-functioning, high performance team, it’s important to have diversity of thought and skills. You can’t achieve this by hiring a collection of people that are too similar, or worst still, a clone of yourself. Unfortunately, many managers make this mistake … ending up with a team that thinks just like the manager and thus has blind spots that ultimately can cause substantial strategic challenges. A good manager for engineers requires both solid and broad technical acumen and good management/leadership skills. It’s important that engineers respect the technical skills/acumen of their manager and also respect their management/leadership skills. Engineers, by their nature, are very inquisitive and usually exhibit a stronger-than-average desire to continue to learn. The ideal manager is capable of providing challenging tasks, while at the same time helping improve their team members’ technical skills. In order to get engineers to perform at their best, managers must hire great people, set clear roles and responsibilities and continue to raise performance expectations of themselves and their team. It’s also important for managers to clearly communicate how each engineer’s work contributes to the success of the overall company. Building a high performing, strong workplace culture requires a commitment by managers to hire and coach great team members that are diverse in their thinking and skill sets, who get to know each other, who respect each other, and who ideally like, and enjoy working with each other. Along with setting clear roles and responsibilities, and continually having high expectations of themselves and the team, successful managers and leaders understand the power, and take seriously the challenge, of creating a strong workplace culture that’s built for success. —Tom Lacey is the CEO of Tessera Technologies.

Matter of fact, what you wrote explains why I got stuck on #5, while reading the article. I can agree with much of what came before #5, but I'm sorry, I don't look at managers as "leaders," much less "role models." Gimme a break.  Managers are more those who have to run interference, to keep the corporate mickey-mouse at bay. Managers who think of themselves as leaders are the problem. Those with high turn-over in their groups. The best manager I've ever had was fantastic. First of all, he could not tolerate BS, not from the top and not from us either. What you would call "real." He called towing the corporate party line "drinking the cool-aid." He had a special knack for seeing through facades. I've never met anyone who could read a person more quickly. And he trusted that we knew what we had to do. An amazing combination. I'm not saying that a young engineer, just starting out, can be expected to be self-directing. But it's usually going to be the more senior engineers to show him the ropes, until the younger one has the confidence to know how to proceed, without having to be told every step of the way. And please save us from the idiotic, ceremonial meetings, which the less capable managers seem to love. An opportunity for them to simultaneously be spoonfed what they should learn on their own, or by asking the right person without tying up everyone else, and to pontificate, to "prove" to themselves they are "leaders." The best managers by far are those who don't play-act the role.

I learned most of the good stuff and applied it as best I could (nobody's perfect). But I'll add a couple of things to worst managers.  The two directors from where I recently quit.  One had thought, wrongly, that I had been recruited by the parent company to take his job from him, so put every obstacle he could in my path to, the other has a huge ego, a thin skin, and essentially zero technical understanding, so he pretty much did the same to protect his ego.  I'm forbidden from telling which company. Reply   Post Message   Messages List   Start a Board User Rank Author best managers anon3887601   10/7/2016 1:57:59 PM NO RATINGS Login to Rate I used to work for a major telecom manufacturer, now defunct.  I've had managers who were both abysmal and outstanding. The best managers I had took advantage of their employee's strengths, but never held them back when learning new things was desired or necessary.  This included aiming high with assignments and responsibilities, when they knew the engineer could do it even if the engineer themselves were uncertain. One of the best managers I ever had summed up his philosophy thus: "I want my engineers to live a BS free existence".  He never micromanaged or interfered with his engineers' work unless they were in trouble and needed help.  He ran interference to shield them from corporate political games, and he backed his staff 100% unconditionally in times of controversy.  Every one of the people who were under him who later became managers themselves turned out to be exceptional managers.  Many followed him to other companies after ours went down. And I might as well add this.  The *worst* managers were those who only cared about meeting schedules and deadlines, often to the detriment of the end product's quality.   Wayne   Reply   Post Message   Messages List   Start a Board User Rank Author How does this add value for our customer? DCH0   10/6/2016 11:26:03 AM NO RATINGS Login to Rate I fully agree with #3 "Use data to make decisions wherever possible. It is straight math ... by making data-based decisions, one makes the right calls more frequently."  One of the best effects of this is to eliminate favoritism and implicit discrimination. I have ended some bad side channel comments by simply asking How is this adding value for our customer? Of course, data to make decisions is only effective if you know which data you should be using.

And in all honesty I wasn't successful there. I blame myself for being a better engineer than I was a politician. I should have listened to the warning bells when a senior Intel manager confided in me that 'It wasn't what you do that makes you successful here. It's the perception of what you do.' So perception was more important to management in my organization than solid engineering: on schedule, under budget, and delivering a quality system kind of thing. Those solid engineering values I learned in the Texas oil patch where there was accountability. Output was indeed measurable. And output was the metric by which engineers lived or died. Shoddy engineering was not tolerated in Texas. Intel drove the stake through the heart of many a fine engineer by burying them in meetings and bureaucracy. Andy Grove might have been a great man and a great leader but his skills didn't translate down the foodchain. And I will always remember Intel mid-layer management being nothing more than a tremendous disappointment.

Users who want support for the next generation Intel CPUs will require a regular ‘current branch’ Windows 10 version. The next update of Windows 10 LTSB is expected by 2019. In the meantime Intel has scheduled to release two new CPU architectures, but these won’t be officially supported. The LTSB version of Windows 10 is designed for long term support of hardware and software. It receives security updates but doesn’t get any new features, including no support for newer hardware. Michael Niehaus, Director of Product Marketing at Microsoft, told Heise.de the company is aware of the problem but, “officially every new CPU and chipset requires a new version of Windows, which is the same for LTSB versions.” Because the next LTSB version is expected for 2019, users of the current LTSB build 1607 can’t use any of the new CPUs. The expected Intel Cannonlake and Coffeelake architectures will only be supported by ‘current branch’ Windows 10 versions, such as installed on most computers. Normally new LTSB versions should be released every two or three years, however Microsoft also released an update for together with the Anniversary Update. The first LTSB version saw the light in 2015 together with the RTM version of Windows 10. According to Niehaus the problem is discussed inside Microsoft and with Intel, but he is unable to give any details on a possible solution because the CPUs and chipsets are not available yet. “In the past you only needed new drivers to support new CPUs and chipsets, however nowadays chipsets need specific setting in the operating system to work with reasonable performance and battery life.” Related Forum: Latest News Headlines Related Tags: windows 10 intel microsoft Microsoft extends Windows 10 support with a year Intel restricts overclocking of Skylake CPUs with BIOS update CPUs require Windows 10 from Intel Kaby Lake and AMD Bristol Ridge onwards Microsoft updates Windows Lifecycle Fact Sheet with Windows 10 support end date Xercus Moderator Posted on: 05 Oct 16 16:29 Now, this is hardly headline material. Like the article states, the LTSB editions were made to support mission critical legacy installs and and as said "the installs you do today will continue to work for the next 10 years" (provided they are initially compatible with the LTSB edition in question) The LTSB editions does not even get feature updates, only security and mission critical legacy installs does not necessarily need support for any new 'lake' processor as long as it is possible to install it virtually on an Intel Xeon processor (being the currently most probable) or older hardware. 1 Agree aztekk MyCE Rookie Posted on: 05 Oct 16 20:51 Windows 10 LTSB will still run on those CPU's, only with less power saving options. So I don't see why this is news to anyone, it's always been this way for old Windows versions. 2 Agree tatobrutto New Member Posted on: 14 Oct 16 11:16 I’m working for a large organisation with 8000 users working in multiple business. Like a lot of other companies around the World we are trying to figure out how to migrate to Windows 10. One of the first task is to find the correct branch of the Enterprise version of Windows 10 (CB, CBB, LTBS) that will fit best our needs. Easy? Not at all! When I heard about LTSB the first time I was enthusiast. I thought: “-Finally MS has understood that a considerable part of the enterprises, focus on custom business applications and needs a very stable, wide compatible, secure and customizable OS. Enterprises will happily pay for needed features (or apps) because this usually means there is a kind of ROI with them. Home’s features are not needed nor welcome in an well-organized company because they may deconcentrate users out of their business and also need extra (useless) maintenance (security hole/patches/fix/…)”. But sorry, I was wrong! MS will drop support for Windows 7 on Kaby Lake CPU before the end of the extended support of Windows 7. Now MS (seems, I hope not decided yet) will NOT supports Cannon Lake CPU with Windows 10 LTBS. It’s quite easy to everyone imagine a strategy against enterprise customers that have paid billions dollars during the past decades and that have made MS what is now. Let hope someone in MS will clarify soon, once and for all, that Enterprises are still a recognized customer type that deserve working tools and support. If Windows 10 Enterprise LTSB cannot “survive” a new incoming hardware during its support timeframe, than it’s not even a branch option. Missing, i.e. some new power management features, is one thing, losing support, is another story. If MS really want to help Enterprise migrations to Windows 10, than it should now release an official clear statement about LTSB support and educate its consultants because, at the moments, they seems confused like us. 6 Agree Register Login Register to Myce.com Register in 10 seconds, pick a username, enter your mail address and proof you're human, that's all!

Traditionally, fanless high-performance PCs have come with a high price tag. However, with the focus on low-power Core-series CPUs by Intel, we have many vendors targeting this market segment with affordable models. Zotac started a new lineup of passively cooled ultra-compact form factor (UCFF) machines in the C-series back in mid-2014. Initially, the members of the series utilized either Atom-class or -Y series CPUs (with a sub-10W TDP). With Skylake, Zotac has re-engineered the design to accommodate 15W Skylake-U CPUs. This review focuses on evaluating the performance and thermal design of the Zotac ZBOX CI523 nano, a fanless NUC-style machine designed to go against the Intel NUC6i3SYH (based on the Intel Core i3-6100U). Introduction Zotac's fanless C-series mini-PCs have been generally been well-reviewed and can be credited with bringing affordable passively-cooled high-performance computing systems to the average consumer. We reviewed the three different families in the first-generation - the Haswell-Y-equipped ZBOX CI540 nano, the AMD A6-1450-equipped ZBOX CA320 nano and the Bay Trail-M-equipped ZBOX CI320 nano. Out of these three, the Haswell-Y probably put the most stress on the thermal design with a 11.5W TDP / 6W SDP. However, our thermal stress test showed that the design was able to handle that without any hiccups. With the latest C-series announced in tandem with other Skylake mini-PCs, Zotac has gone in for a slightly larger and heavier solution to handle the higher TDP of the Skylake-U series. In order to maintain affordability and price-competitiveness against the corresponding actively-cooled Intel NUC, Zotac has opted for DDR3L SO-DIMM slots (instead of DDR4) and support for 2.5" SATA drives only (no M.2 slot). Hardware Design and Platform Analysis The Zotac ZBOX CI523 nano comes in a barebones configuration as well as PLUS configurations. The latter includes a single RAM stick (one slot left empty for future upgrade by the end user) and a SSD. We were sampled the barebones configuration. In order to complete the build, we used Corsair's Vengeance DDR3L 2133 MHz 2x 8GB kit and a 500GB Crucial MX200 SSD. The specifications of our review configuration are presented in the table below. Zotac ZBOX CI523 nano Specifications Processor Intel Core i3-6100U Skylake, 2C/4T, 2.3 GHz, 14nm, 3MB L2, 15W TDP Memory Corsair Vengeance CMSX16GX3M2B2133C11 9-9-9-28 @ DDR3L-1600  2x8 GB Graphics Intel HD Graphics 520 Disk Drive(s) Crucial MX200 CT500MX200SSD1 (500 GB; 2.5in SATA 6Gb/s; 16nm; MLC) Networking Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 3165 (1x1 802.11ac - 433 Mbps) Realtek RTL8168/8111 PCIe Gigabit Ethernet Adapter Audio 3.5mm Headphone and Microphone Jacks (Realtek ALC892) Capable of 5.1/7.1 digital output with HD audio bitstreaming (HDMI) Display 1x DP 1.2 (3840x2160 @ 60 Hz) 1x HDMI 1.4b (4096x2160 @ 24Hz) Miscellaneous I/O Ports 2x USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-C 2x USB 3.0 Type-A 2x USB 2.0 Type-A 1x SDXC Slot Operating System Retail unit is barebones, but we installed Windows 10 Pro x64 Pricing (As configured) $320 ($640) Full Specifications Zotac ZBOX CI523 nano Specifications Buy Zotac ZBOX CI523 nano on Amazon.com The kit doesn't come with any OS, but we installed Windows 10 Pro x64 for our benchmarking purposes. The package does include a CD as well as a read-only USB key with the Windows 10 drivers. Other than the main unit, we also have a 65W (19V @ 3.42A) DC adapter, a user manual and a quick start guide, metal tabs and screws for VESA mounting, a thermal pad for the 2.5" drive and a dual-band Wi-Fi dipole antenna. The dimensions of the CI523 nano come in at 146.4mm x 126.5mm x 60.5mm, making it slightly larger than the NUC6i3SYH at 115mm x 111mm x 48mm. The internals get an upgrade compared to the previous C-series units: instead of the thermal pad over the SoC / CPU, we now have a substantial heat-sink (pictured in the gallery below, courtesy of ComputerBase.de). The underside of the chassis also has a metal plate with ridges to aid in VESA mounting. The ridged plate is part of the thermal design to take away the heat from the DRAM and the 2.5-inch drive on the bottom side of the board. This is aided by thermal pads that are affixed to those components and make contact with the bottom part of the chassis. Otherwise, the chassis and thermal design are similar to the previous generation units - a honeycomb design with a mesh inside to help in the convective cooling process. Gallery: Zotac ZBOX CI523 nano - Chassis Design and Internals Moving on to the other features of the CI523 nano, we have two USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-C ports in the front panel that are enabled by an ASMedia ASM1142 controller. A USB 3.0 Type-A port is placed vertically above these two Type-C ports. Audio jacks and a SDXC card slot, along with the power button and some status LEDs round out the front panel. The rear panel has two USB 2.0 ports and a USB 3.0 port (all Type-A), a RJ-45 Gigabit LAN port, HDMI and Display Port (full-size) outputs and a RP-TNC connector for the Wi-Fi dipole antenna. The Zotac ZBOX CI523 nano is based on the standard Skylake-U platform with the Sunrise Point-LP PCH integrated in the same package as the CPU. There are a maximum of 16 possible high-speed I/O lanes in a Skylake-U system, and they can be configured in a flexible manner. The PCIe lanes in our configuration of the ZBOX CI523 nano are distributed as follows: PCI-E 3.0 x2 port #4      In Use @ x1 (Realtek RTL8168/8111 PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet Adapter) PCI-E 3.0 x1 port #5      In Use @ x1 (Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 3165 AC HMC WiFi Adapter) PCI-E 3.0 x1 port #12    In Use @ x1 (ASMedia ASM1142 USB 3.1 xHCI Controller) In the table below, we have an overview of the various systems that we are comparing the ZOTAC ZBOX CI523 nano against. Note that they may not belong to the same market segment. The relevant configuration details of the machines are provided so that readers have an understanding of why some benchmark numbers are skewed for or against the ZOTAC ZBOX CI523 nano when we come to those sections.

That is a big difference. I looked at the price and couldn't believe that it was an i7. Then I kept reading and realized it wasn't an i7. Reply YSJ - Wednesday, October 05, 2016 - link HWinfo on the Power Consumption page says it's an i5-6200U Reply ganeshts - Wednesday, October 05, 2016 - link Guys, the i7 mention is a table porting typo from the previous review. It has been fixed. The core count / frequencies / cache size were fixed correctly after the copy-over. Apologies for the typo. The HWiNFO representation is erroneous because Zotac uses the same product ID string for both the CI523 nano and CI543 nano. The latter uses the Core i5, and HWiNFO gets confused because of that. The AIDA64 report confirming the Core i3-6100U (if it wasn't obvious from the multiple references to it in the text of the review and also the frequencies in the graphs) is here: http://images.anandtech.com/reviews/mini-pcs/AIDA-... Reply JoeyJoJo123 - Wednesday, October 05, 2016 - link No dual LAN, no interest. I'd really like Zotac/Gigabyte/Intel to make a SFF NUC-like PC with dual LAN so that I can buy one to be used as a pfSense router. I'd highly prefer not to be stuck with an anemic pentium/celeron chinese off-brand pfSense router...

There's even an affordable barebones for less than $150, too, here: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0179S50UU/ Thanks, Ganesh! Reply damianrobertjones - Wednesday, October 05, 2016 - link Imagine a world where you can buy a USB ethernet adapter! :) Reply ganeshts - Wednesday, October 05, 2016 - link Latency is an issue with USB Ethernet adapters. In addition, for pfSense and other networking applications, some of the hardware acceleration features / offloads provided by Intel NICs can help provide better overall performance. USB Ethernet adapters are fine for the average use-case, but, I wouldn't suggest using them for any performance-sensitive scenarios.

Today we learnt that Asus has also updated all its 100 series motherboards for compatibility with Intel's upcoming range of 7th Generation Core processors. click to zoom Asus has released a lot of 100 Series motherboards over recent months so it has had to release a lot of BIOS updates for compatibility with Kaby Lake. If your motherboard is based upon the Intel Z170, Q170, H170, B150, H110, or C232 chipset it looks like you're covered for an Intel 7th Generation Core processor upgrade when they become available in a few months time. (see above table) To get this latest Kaby Lake ready BIOS go to the product page for your particular motherboard and select the 'support' tab. On the next page click the 'driver and tools' tab, then select your OS. Scroll down the 'files found' list to the BIOS section and expand it. At the top of that list will be the latest BIOS, supporting Intel's 7th Generation Core processors. Alternatively, if you use or download the ASUS EZ Update accessory software, you can 'one-click' auto-update your BIOS as-and-when updates become available. This software is part of the ASUS AI Suite 3, available from the 'utilities' section of your motherboard support, drivers and tools page. I couldn't find an Asus blog post or news feature detailing these BIOS updates, and don't have an Asus motherboard, so I 'randomly' picked a motherboard to check if there was any more information regarding the new BIOS available. There wasn't. All I found was that the H170-PRO BIOS version 2003 "Supports new CPUs" and it was a 9.27MB download that contained no readme.txt or changelog. This particular motherboard BIOS update for Kaby Lake was released late last month.

Using 3D TLC flash memory developed in conjunction with Micron, Intel has been able to keep pricing in check and offers the 600p in capacities starting at 128GB for $67 with sequential reads and writes of up to 770MB/s and 450MB/s (1.8GB/s and 560 MB/s on the 1TB model). While that's slower than what we have come to expect from M.2 NVMe drives, keep in mind that this series is meant to be affordable. In comparison, the Samsung SSD 950 Pro is rated for at least 2.2GB/s write speeds coupled with 900MB/s write for the 256GB model and 1.5GB/s for the 512GB version. However, what's important to note here that the 950 Pro 256GB costs $187. 120 - 128GB 240 - 256GB 480 - 512GB 960/1TB Intel SSD 600p $67 ($0.52/GB) $109 ($0.42/GB) $189 ($0.36/GB) N/A Intel SSD 750 Series N/A N/A $300 (400GB) ($0.75/GB) $610 (800GB) ($0.76/GB) Samsung 950 Pro N/A $186 ($0.72/GB) $315 ($0.61/GB) N/A Samsung 850 Pro N/A $123 ($0.48/GB) $250 ($0.48/GB) $460 ($0.44/GB) Samsung SSD 850 Evo N/A $100 ($0.40/GB) $163 ($0.32/GB) $306 ($0.29/GB) Kingston UV400 $41 ($0.34/GB) $64 ($0.26/GB) $117 ($0.24/GB) $273 ($0.28/GB) Crucial MX300 N/A $70 (275GB) ($0.25/GB) $120 (525GB) ($0.22/GB) $250 (1TB) ($0.24/GB) Roughly the same amount of money buys a 512GB version of Intel's 600p. At just $0.36 per gigabyte, the 600p 512GB looks to be exceptional value, particularly when you consider that the cheapest TLC SATA 2.5" drives cost $0.24 per gigabyte and should be a good bit slower. Not only that, but compared to premium SATA MLC drives such as the Samsung SSD 850 Pro, the Intel 600p is still quite a bit cheaper. Meet Intel's 600p 512GB As just mentioned, there are four capacities to choose from, though we recommend avoiding the 128GB model as the cost per gigabyte on that one is rather high. The 256GB and 512GB models are well priced and we are still waiting for the 1TB model to arrive, though we expect it to be competitive also. The 512GB model is rated for a sequential read and write speed of 1775MB/s and 560MB/s, respectively, while its random read IOPS come in at 155,000 with the write IOPS reaching 128,000. So again, not in the same class as the much more expensive NVMe drives such as Samsung's 950 Pro, Toshiba's OCZ RD400 or even Intel's own SSD 750 Series. Intel has managed to even squeeze the 1TB model into the (2280) 80mm form factor so compatibility in compact systems won't be an issue. All chips have been placed on the front side of the PCB for the 512GB model we have on-hand and we're waiting to see how the 1TB model will be configured. Speaking of chips onboard, we find just three IMFT 3D TLC NAND flash memory chips which as we mentioned are considerably more affordable than equivalent MLC chips. Having an odd number of memory chips seems quite strange though it makes sense here. Each TLC chip features two dies stacked, hence the '3D NAND'. This means each chip has a capacity of 192GB which adds up to a total of 576GB allowing headroom for overprovisioning and a 17.5GB SLC cache. Finally, also included is a 2GB DDR3L-1600 DRAM cache. Thanks to its nearly limitless development budget, Intel's firmware has managed to avoid the bugs that plagued other brands' SSDs. However, an in-house Intel controller isn't inside this drive, as you might have guessed. Rather, the company has opted for an unlikely candidate in Silicon Motion. Of course, this isn't the first time Intel has outsourced for an SSD controller as the SSD 510 sported a Marvell controller while the SSD 520 carried the controversial SandForce SF-2000. While we don't expect the Silicon Motion controller to suffer any issues, Intel has nonetheless taken a hands on approach here as evidenced by the unique packaging and part number. For good measure, Intel has also stamped its logo on the controller which has been finished with a coated copper heat spreader on top that should help with heat dissipation, a common issue for M.2 SSDs. The controller meets the NVMe 1.1 specification and as such as PCIe 3.0 x4 (4 Gb/s) bandwidth at its disposal. All the standard stuff is on offer here such as TRIM, garbage collection and S.M.A.R.T. Also included is an internal AES 256-bit hardware encryption engine but unlike the Intel SSD Pro 6000p Series designed for business users, accelerated eDrive or other encryption services in Windows are not supported. All four Intel 600p SSDs boast the same five-year warranty along with the same 72-terabyte TBW endurance rating, which is unusual and we would typically expect the larger models to have a higher rating. How We Test As you likely know, while manufacturers claim impressive peak I/O performance out of the box, this performance can diminish over time. Unlike a conventional hard drive, any write operation made to an SSD is a two-step process: a data block must be erased and then written to. Obviously if the drive is new and unused there will be nothing to erase and therefore the first step can be bypassed, but this only happens once unless the drive is trimmed. Considering this, we run the HD Tach full benchmark several times to fill the drive before testing. This simulates heavy usage and clearly indicates how performance will be affected after normal long-term use. Most drives support the TRIM function, which is meant to counteract these negative effects.

This places it well ahead of the fastest SATA SSDs and not far behind the mighty Samsung 950 Pro. The program copy test is comprised of many small non-compressed files ranging from just 1K up to 5000K in size (6104 files totalling 2.75GB). The performance here is very unexpected as the 600p is nowhere to be seen. The throughput dropped to just 159MB/s making the Intel 600p one of the lowest SSDs we have tested in recent times. Our last file copy test uses game data in a mixture of small and large, compressed and non-compressed files. The Intel 600p returns to form in our game copy test with a throughput of 464MB/s, placing it roughly on par with the Kingston Predator. The performance here isn't mind blowing but it's acceptable given the price tag.

Low Cost, Low Power, 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10Gb6) Performance for the Entire Datacenter Standard CAT-6a Cabling with RJ45 Connectors Backward Compatibility with Existing 1000BASE-T Networks Simplifies the Transition to 10GbE Flexible I/O virtualization for port partitioning and quality of service (QoS) of up to 64 virtual ports Unified Networking Delivering LAN, iSCSI, and FCoE in One Low Cost CNA Industry First Dual-Port 10GBASE-T Adapter with Single-Chip Solution with Integrated MAC + PHY Reliable and proven 10 Gigabit Ethernet technology from Intel Corporation 10 Gigabit for the Broad Market The Intel Ethernet Converged Network Adapter X540 is the latest innovation in Intel's leadership to drive 10 Gigabit Ethernet into the broader server market This adapter hosts Intel's latest Ether¬net silicon, the Intel8 Ethernet Controller X540, which is used by many OEMs as a single chip solution for LAN on Mother¬board (LOM) to deliver 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10 GbE) on the latest server platforms. 10GBASE-T Simplifies the Transition to 10 GbE The Intel X540 family of products works with existing networks today. It works with legacy Gigabit Ethernet (GbE) switches and Cat 6A cabling. Install the Intel X540 adapter into a server and the auto-negotiation between 1 GbE and 10 GbE provides the necessary backwards compatibility that most customers require for a smooth transition and easy migration to 10 GbE. When time and budget allows, 10GBASE-T switches can be added any time to experience the full benefits of 10 GbE. 10GBASE-T uses the copper twisted pair cables that are very familiar to IT profes¬sionals today. It is everything you know and love about 1000BASE-T. The knowl¬edge, training and investment in BASE-T are preserved. 10GBASE-T is the easiest and most versatile 10 GbE and you can deploy it anywhere in your data center. Its flexible reach from 1 meter to 100 meters supports the latest network architectures including Top of Rack (ToR), Middle of Row (MoR), and End of Row (EoR). 10G Performance at Low Cost and Low Power The new Intel Ethernet Converged Network Adapter X540 is the lowest cost way to deploy 10 Gb£ in your data center today. The Intel X540 uses low cost, Cat 6 and Cat 6A cabling. Chances are this cabling already exists in the data center. A way for Intel to reduce cost and power is to integrate components into a single-chip solution. Of course, integration is what Intel does best. With the new Intel X540 Controller, the MAC and the PHY are integrated into a single-chip solution. So, why is integration important? First, integration translates to lower power. A single-chip solution simply uses less power than two separate components. This means no more active heat sink and reduces the per-port power consumption. Second, integration also means lower cost per port. Manufacturing a single part costs less than two. When cabling is accounted for, cost efficiencies realized from a single part mean 10GBAS6-T is the lowest cost media to deploy. With lower cost and power, 10GBASE-T is ready for broad deployment. 10GBAS6-T is an option for every rack and tower server in the data center. The wait for a low cost 10 GbE copper solution to broadly deploy 10 GbE to all corners of the data center is over. The new Intel X540 adapter provides bandwidth-intensive applications with highly affordable 10 GbE network performance and cost-effective RJ-45 con¬nectivity for distances up to 100 meters. Exciting New Data Center Usage Models More than simply a 10x increase in per¬formance, with 10 Gb£ there are exciting new usage models that are now possible, including Unified Networking (iSCSI, FCoE and LAN), Visualization (VMDq and SR-I0V), and now, Flexible Port Partitioning (FPP). Flexible I/O Visualization Virtualization changes the way server resources are deployed and managed by running multiple applications and operat¬ing systems independently on a single server. The Intel Ethernet Converged Network Adapter X540 includes Intel Virtualiza¬tion Technology for connectivity (Intel VT-c) to deliver I/O virtualization and Quality of Service (QoS) features designed directly into the Intel X540 controller on the adapter. Intel I/O virtualization advances network connectivity models used in today's servers to more efficient models by providing FPP, multiple Rx/Tx queues, and on-controller QoS functional¬ity that can be used in both virtual and non-virtual server deployments. Flexible Port Partitioning (FPP) By taking advantage of the PCI-SIG SR-IOV specification, Intel Ethernet products en¬able FPP. With FPP, virtual controllers can be used by the Linux* host directly and/or assigned to virtual machines. FPP allows you to use the functionality of SR-IOV to assign up to 63 processes per port to virtual functions in Linux. This enables an administrator to partition their 10 GbE bandwidth across multiple processes, ensuring a QoS by giving each assigned process equal bandwidth. Network admin¬istrators may also rate-limit each of these services to control how much of the 10 GbE pipe is available to each process. Unified Networking Unified Networking solutions on the new Intel Ethernet Converged Network Adapter X540 let you combine the traffic of multiple data center networks like LAN and SAN onto a single efficient network fabric. You now have the choice of NFS, iSCSI, or Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) to carry both network and storage traffic at speeds of up to 10 Gbps. The Intel X540 adapter combines support for all of these traffic types in one adapter at no additional cost and with no additional licensing fees for the adapter. Intel's Unified Networking solutions are enabled through a combination of standard Intel6 Ethernet products along with trusted network protocols integrated in the operating systems. Thus, Unified Networking is available on every Server either through LAN-on-Motherboard (LOM) implementation or via an add-in Network Interface Card (NIC). Intel has delivered high quality Ethernet products for over 30 years and our Unified Networking solutions are built on the original principles that made us successful in Ethernet: Open Architecture integrates network¬ing with the server, enabling IT managers to reduce complexity and overhead while enabling a flexible and scalable data cen¬ter network. Intelligent Offloads lower cost and power while delivering the application performance that customers expect. Proven Ethernet Unified Networking is built on trusted Intel Ethernet technol¬ogy, enabling customers to deploy FCoE or iSCSI while maintaining the quality of their traditional Ethernet networks. iSCSI Simplifies SAN Connectivity iSCSI uses Ethernet to carry storage traf¬fic, extending the familiarity and simplicity of Ethernet to storage networking, with¬out the need for SAN-specific adapters or switches. Intel5 Ethernet X540 is the easi¬est, most reliable, and most cost-effective way of connecting servers to iSCSI SANs. Open FCoE Consolidates LANs and Legacy SANs Intel's Open FCoE solution enables Intel Ethernet 10 Gigabit Server products (adapters and controllers) to support Fibre Channel payload encapsulated in Ethernet frames. There is no upgrade charge for Open FCoE on the adapter Just as with iSCSI, now customers can easily connect to an FCoE network with Intel 10 GbE solutions. For the first time, Open-FCoE is now supported on 10GBASE-T.As 10GBASE-T switches come to market enabled with FCoE support, the Intel X540 is ready when you're ready. This enables you to use cost-effective 10GBASE-T for all your converged networking needs. The Open-FCoE architecture uses a combination of FCoE initiators in Microsoft Windows* and Linux* operating systems and in the VMware* ESXi hypervisor to deliver high-performance FCoE solutions using standard 10 GbE Ethernet adapters. This approach enables IT managers to simplify the data center and standardize on a single adapter for LAN and SAN con¬nectivity. The Intel4 Ethernet Converged Network Adapter X540 is designed to fully offload the FCoE data path to deliver full-featured converged network adapter (CNA) functionality without compromising on power efficiency and interoperability. Data Center Bridging (DCB) Delivers Lossless Ethernet Conventional Ethernet does not guar¬antee successful data delivery, which is not acceptable for SAN traffic. Ethernet enhancements such as Data Center Bridg¬ing (DCB) overcome that limitation with technologies that guarantee lossless deliv¬ery, congestion notification, priority-based flow control, and priority groups. The combination of 10 GbE and unified networking helps organizations overcome connectivity challenges and simplify the data center infrastructure. 10 GbE pro¬vides a simple, well-understood fabric for virtualized data centers, one that helps reduce cost and complexity as the number of virtual machines continues to grow.

Don’t Be Ridiculous This Fool disagrees with a well-known tech journalist on the relationship between Apple and its Mac processor supplier, Intel. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 4, 2016 at 8:44PM Image source: Getty Images.  Writing for The Verge, Vlad Savov recently argued that microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) "let Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) down once with the original MacBook's underpowered Core M processor, and the absence of an Intel Skylake upgrade for either the MacBook Pro or Air this year also seems to have been caused by Apple's dissatisfaction with Intel's CPUs." Savov continues, declaring that "there is nothing that Apple would like to do more than rid itself of its reliance on Intel, which would eliminate such unforeseen hiccups in the future." To that, I respond with the following: Don't be ridiculous. If the first-gen Core M is under-powered, what was the A8X? The first point that Savov brings up is the fact that the first-generation of Core M processor inside of Apple's first 12-inch fan-less MacBook was "underpowered." I can sort of see what the author is talking about here. Intel's marketing claim that these chips delivered "the experience of Intel Core in fanless form factors" was something of a stretch. However, it was a reasonable first step.    According to Geekbench 4, the Core M-5Y71-based 12-inch MacBook (the Core M-5Y71 is the fastest of the Broadwell-based Core M chips) achieves a single-core score of 3251 and a multi-core score of 5691. Apple's fastest shipping processor at the time -- the A8X -- achieved a single-core score of 1833 and a multi-core score of 4001. It looks to me that despite Savov's claim that the original Core M chip was "underpowered," Apple wasn't really fielding anything better at the time. Later in 2015, Apple released the A9X chip, and Intel released a second-generation set of Core M processors based on a new architecture. The A9X was quite impressive, achieving a single-core score of 3150 and a multi-core score of 4893 -- almost as good as the first-generation Core M chip that Savov dissed. Image Source: Apple. The second-generation Core M-6Y75, in the same Geekbench 4 test, achieves a single-core score of 3715 and a multi-core score of 6974 -- solidly ahead of the older Core M chip, as well as Apple's A9X. This score is also better than what the A10 Fusion is able to put up (though if I were Intel, I would probably be sweating the fact that a smartphone processor is able to come this close to a late 2015 fan-less notebook/2-in-1 processor). Intel has already announced the successor to the Core M-6Y75, known as the Core i7-7Y75, which should pull even further ahead of the A9X. That being said, I do expect Apple's upcoming A10X to be very close in performance to the i7-7Y75 (in Geekbench 4, my guess is that single-core performance between the two will be similar, with Intel pulling ahead in multi-core performance), which should be an excellent achievement for Apple. Apple is good -- really good. But it's important to keep in perspective that we are not comparing tablet-class Apple processors to power-hungry desktop processors -- we're comparing the Apple chips to very low-power Intel processors suitable for very thin and light fan-less devices, such as the 12-inch MacBook. Savov claims that if a company wants to "develop the next great processor," that company had "better be going mobile first and building from there." Given the amount of effort that Intel has been putting into its low-power notebook processor efforts over the last several years, and given the fact that Intel has successfully developed Core architecture chips that can adequately power thin, light, and fan-less devices, such as the 12-inch MacBook, it's not clear where the author's criticism of Intel's efforts comes from. How about that second claim? Savov also argued that the fact that Apple hasn't updated its MacBook Air/Pro lineup to include Intel's sixth-generation Core processors (the Airs and the 13-inch Pro use fifth-generation Core chips; the 15-inch Pro uses a fourth-generation Core chip) is indicative of Apple's "dissatisfaction with Intel CPUs." There's just no evidence to really substantiate that claim, particularly since the sixth-generation Core chips are much better than the fourth/fifth-generation Core chips that Apple is currently shipping in its MacBook Air and MacBook Pro lines.  It has been widely reported that Apple is planning substantial form factor and technology changes to its next-generation MacBook Pro products. These systems will very likely use Intel's sixth-generation Core processors. If Apple is going to adopt these Intel processors anyway (albeit later than the rest of the industry), does it really make sense that the reason that we can't buy Skylake-based MacBook Pros today is that Apple is "dissatisfied" with Intel's chips? It seems more likely to me that Apple didn't see the point in updating its systems with newer Intel processors without significant form factor/user experience changes elsewhere. In other words, it looks more like a matter of Apple's Mac software/hardware development timeline not synchronizing with Intel's processor release cadence (which, frankly, is probably more dictated by the likes of Dell than by Apple) more than anything else.

Intel over the past few weeks has continued to press forward with its efforts in the growing wearable device market, taking advantage of high-profile fashion shows in New York and Paris to show off its capabilities and putting its financial backing behind a startup in the industry. Intel officials view the wearable space—indeed, the internet of things (IoT) market as a whole—as a significant growth area for the company and is aggressively moving away from its legacy as a PC chip maker to be the foundational tech supplier for an increasingly connected world. The vendor for several years has been expanding into the area of connected wearable devices, and showed off its latest innovations over the past several weeks. Most recently, Intel and Luxottica Group this week unveiled the Oakley-branded Radar Pace smart eyewear (pictured), which essentially acts as a virtual coach for wearers while running or cycling. The smart glasses, which sell for $449 on the Oakley website, connect to free smartphone apps for Apple's iOS or Google's Android mobile operating systems and use Intel's Real Speech technology to communicate with the wearer. The Radar Pace eyewear, via the apps, can develop a training program based on the wearer’s goals and training already completed and track the wearer’s performance, according to officials with both companies. The device interprets data in real time and, through ear buds attached to the sides and an integrated microphone, can coach the wearer in the moment and respond to the user's questions, giving the person a hands-free and natural way to work out, they said. In addition, through the Bluetooth headset, the user also can make and receive calls, listen to music and text. Intel first began working with Luxottica in 2014 to develop smart, fashionable eyewear. Radar Pace came after years of joint research and development between the two companies. The device collects and analyzes a range of data around the user's performance, from heart rate and speed to cadence, time, pace and distance. It takes the information and uses it for audio coaching. Ryan Saylor, vice president of advanced product development at Oakley, said the combination of expertise from his company and Intel has created "a game changer in training and coaching. One of the biggest benefits is the accountability—the coach being there with the athletes to help get the most out of every workout." During Fashion Week in Paris, designer Hussein Chalayan showed off smart glasses and belts powered by Intel's tiny Curie wearables module, which projected the stress levels of the models wearing them on the surrounding walls. Intel officials said the data is collected by the Curie module and sent to the belt via Bluetooth Low Energy connectivity. A Compute Stick from Intel is used to process the data and a small projector in the belt is used to project the data onto the wall in front of the model to show real-time stress levels . "The result was not only an amazing visual experience for show goers, but an exciting step forward in creating desirable, tech-infused wearables that empower the wearer to understand and respond to the world around them," Sandra Lopez, a vice president in Intel's New Technology Group who also oversees strategic relationships and business development within the unit, wrote in a post on the company blog.

Credit: Intel More like this How Intel plans to change servers as it breaks away from PCs Intel's megachips will take on Nvidia's GPUs and Google's TPUs ARM pact will help Intel woo Apple into new chip deal Video Mingis on Tech: From superfast SSDs to Bluetooth locks and solar shingles It seems like the chip war between Intel and ARM is slowly winding down, at least for the time being. Intel for decades has doggedly sworn by chips based on its homegrown x86 architecture, but the company is putting a 64-bit ARM processor in its new Stratix 10 FPGA (field-programmable gate array), which was announced on Tuesday. The FPGA -- based on Altera technology -- can be reprogrammed to do a wide variety of server or network tasks. It can also run algorithms for machine learning. In a larger context, the chip points to a long-term strategy of Intel thinking beyond x86 and warming up to other architectures as it looks to shed its reliance on PCs. In the future, it's possible that x86 and ARM could be integrated in some Intel's chips. Intel plans to integrate Altera FPGAs in Xeon server chips and may put x86 and ARM CPUs on one chip. Intel is already pairing Xeon and Altera FPGAs on multi-chip circuit boards. ARM CPUs have been used in Altera FPGAs, but the Cortex-A53 in Stratix 10 shows Intel isn't shying away from the latest ARM technology. There's also the possibility of Intel eliminating the ARM CPU for x86 in its integrated Xeon FPGA chip. Intel and ARM have feuded in the past on architectural superiority, sometimes indulging in petty arguments over power and performance. Intel wants to put its x86 chips in as many devices as possible, but it is willing to tap into ARM CPU designs when necessary. A sequence of events has led to a friendlier relationship between Intel and ARM. Facing a slowdown in the PC market, Intel in April restructured to focus on robots, drones, cars, and the internet of things. Most PCs use x86 chips, but ARM dominates many of the fast-growing markets Intel is now focusing on. ARM is also helping drive Intel's lucrative server business. ARM-based mobile and IoT devices feed information to servers that perform data analysis, image recognition, and natural language processing tasks. Intel's x86 chips dominate servers, and the growth in ARM-based devices will indirectly drive sales of high-margin Intel Xeon chips.  Intel can now manufacture ARM chips following a licensing deal both the companies signed in August. Intel will make chips for LG's mobile devices on its 10-nanometer process and could even make chips for Apple's iPhone. Intel previously dedicated its factories mostly to x86 chips, but the PC market slowdown is forcing the chipmaker to take on contract manufacturing. Intel has used ARM designs sparingly. Intel previously made mobile phone chips and networking equipment based on ARM but sold that business to Marvell in 2006. Intel put ARM's Mali graphics in an x86 Atom X3 chip code-named Sofia, which was originally designed for smartphones but is now in IoT devices. Intel also used ARM processors in an XMM modem but is switching over to x86. One of the big areas of focus for Intel is FPGAs, which provide a high-speed chip alternative to its CPUs. The quad-core 64-bit Cortex-A53 CPU in Stratix 10 is faster than previous chips, Intel said.

Intel has begun sampling its Stratix 10 programmable chips, which the company expects to use as accelerators in data center environments running compute- and data-intensive applications. In a blog post Oct. 4, Dan McNamara, corporate vice president and general manager of Intel's Programmable Solutions Group, wrote that company engineers were able to combine the chip maker's 14-nanometer tri-gate manufacturing process with its HyperFlex fabric architecture to develop a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) that will address the growing demands from end users for more performance and power efficiency as they try to manage the proliferation of smart, connected devices and the huge amounts of data they're producing. Intel is aiming the Stratix 10 FGPAs at such workloads as data center applications, cloud computing, radar and imaging systems, and network infrastructure, McNamara wrote. "We live in a smart and connected world where billions of devices are creating massive amounts of data that must be collected, rapidly processed and analyzed, and available from anywhere," he wrote, adding that Intel and the Stratix 10 will enable "service providers, data centers, cloud computing and storage systems to satisfy their insatiable demand for higher computational capabilities, lower latency, greater system flexibility and increased power efficiencies." With Stratix 10, Intel is delivering twice the performance and more than five times the density when compared to the previous generation of FPGAs, and up to 70 percent lower power than Stratix V FPGAs while providing equivalent performance. There also is up to 10 teraflops of single-precision floating point performance, up to 1TB memory bandwidth that includes integrated High-Bandwidth Memory, and an embedded quad-core 64-bit ARM Cortex-A53 chip. FPGAs are among a widening group of accelerators used to help speed up the performance of large-scale systems while keeping a lid on power consumption. Accelerators—particularly GPUs from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices and x86 Xeon Phi co-processors from Intel—have been used in high-performance computing (HPC) and supercomputing environments. However, with the growth in the number of connected devices and the accompanying data, the rise of cloud computing and the internet of things (IoT), and the increasing amount of video in network traffic, the use of accelerators is expanding. Intel officials have said they expect FPGAs to be used in as many as 30 percent of all data center servers by 2020. Intel inherited the Stratix FPGA technology when it bought Altera last year for $16.7 billion. Altera and Xilinx have been the primary vendors behind the development of FPGAs, which have the added benefit of being able to be reprogrammed for different workloads. Intel began shipping Xeon server chips with Arria 10 FPGA accelerators earlier this year. Along with FPGAs and the Xeon Phi co-processors, Intel officials are looking to increase the number of accelerator options by working with eASIC to bring application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) to custom Xeons to be used in enterprise data centers and cloud environments for such workloads as data analytics and security. Intel was a partner of Altera's before buying the company. Intel is not the only chip maker turning to FPGAs. Xilinx has been partnering with such vendors as Qualcomm—which is developing ARM-based systems-on-a-chip (SoCs) aimed at servers—and IBM, which is using Xilinx's FPGAs in Power systems for such workloads as data analytics, machine learning, network-functions virtualization (NFV), HPC and genomics.           LATEST SERVERS ARTICLES   Cray, SGI Awarded $52 Million in Federal Supercomputer Contracts IBM, OpenPower Foundation Make Push into Europe GPU's Role in Artificial Intelligence Advances Featured at Conference EMC Shows Its Data Center Strength at Inaugural Dell EMC Conference Dell EMC Brings PowerEdge Servers to VxRail, VxRack                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

This group of traditional laptops and hybrids is set to launch before the end of 2016, boasting high-end performance, sleek physical designs, and top-tier convenience for users on the move. The collection is headlined by a quartet of new IdeaPad systems, with the entry-level 310 being the most effective at a price point of 28,390 rupees (equal to about $430). The laptop features an Intel seventh-generation Core processor, as well as a 15.6-inch FHD display and Dolby stereo speakers, making it perfect for surfing the web and streaming entertainment. Meanwhile, the IdeaPad 510 caters to audiences that need a tad more horsepower, with sufficient specs to power video editing software and console-quality games at a price of 61,690 rupees (about $930). An Intel Core i7-7500U processor is paired with 8GB of DDR4 RAM and an Nvidia GeForce 940MX graphics card to provide enough muscle to get the job done. Lenovo is also fielding two high-spec, highly portable laptops aimed at professional users, according to a report from WinBeta. The IdeaPad 510S weighs less than 2 kg, but packs 8GB of DDR4 RAM, a 1TB HDD, 2GB of integrated AMD graphics, and a FHD 14-inch display with a 1,920 x 1,080 pixel resolution. The 510S also features an Intel Core i5 7200U processor, two USB 3.0 ports, and one USB 2.0 port with always-on charging capabilities, and retails for 51,090 rupees (about $770). Related: Best Lenovo Laptops At 73,390 rupees (about $1,100), the IdeaPad 710S is the most expensive system of the bunch — but its luxurious design sensibilities and its formidable specifications should make sense of the price tag. Every effort has been made for the 710S to provide standout performance while retaining its highly portable form factor, as evidenced by the super-thin bezel that surrounds its 13.3-inch, 3,200 x 1,800p resolution QHD display. The 710S is 13.9mm thick and weighs less than 2.5 pounds, making it a good choice for anyone with a commute. It also features an Intel Core i7 7500U processor, 8GB of DDR4 RAM, a 512GB SSD, and integrated Intel graphics, with the option to upgrade to Intel Iris graphics. In terms of hybrid systems, Lenovo is making an aggressive move to corner the market with the cost-effective MIIX 310. The 2-in-1 costs just 17,490 rupees (about $260), but it comes stocked with 2GB of RAM, a 32GB EMMC SSD, a 10.1-inch 1,280 x 800p display, and an Intel Atom processor. The device weighs just 580 grams, but has a battery life of up to ten hours. Finally, there’s the Yoga 510, which is set to be made available at a price of 40,990 rupees (about $620). The hybrid makes full use of Lenovo’s 360-degree hinge technology to facilitate a host of different configurations permitting a range of uses. The system is powered by an Intel Core i5 7200U processor, with 8GB of RAM, and a beautiful 14-inch 1,920 x 1,080p display. Various storage options are available, including a 1TB HDD, a 500GB solid state hybrid drive, and a 256GB solid state drive.

Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Oct 4, 2016 at 12:20PM Image Source: Getty Images. With Autumn now in full swing, another earnings season is right around the corner. October will feature quarterly reports from some of the largest, most important companies on the planet, as well as from an abundance of smaller companies. There will be no shortage of data this month for investors to chew on. Of all the companies getting ready to report earnings, five stand out. Here's a brief look at what investors can expect from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), General Motors (NYSE:GM), and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). Apple Following two quarters of declining iPhone sales, the iPhone 7 launch in September has the potential to give Apple a much-needed boost. Apple declined to disclose sales figures for the launch weekend, as it has done for each previous iPhone launch, but strong pre-order numbers from T-Mobile and Sprint have raised hopes that the iPhone 7 will return the company to growth. Apple will report its fiscal fourth-quarter results after the market close on Oct. 27. With the quarter ending just a few weeks after the launch of the iPhone 7, and with the ever-important holiday season ahead, Apple's results won't give investors the full picture. Guidance for the first fiscal quarter will be closely watched: If Apple fails to predict growth, the stock's recent run will almost certainly come to an end. Wells Fargo At this point, it's unclear exactly what kind of damage the ongoing fake account scandal at Wells Fargo will cause. The bank's intense focus on cross-selling products led to fraud that could hurt its reputation for years to come. Already, both California and Illinois have suspended some of its business with Wells Fargo,, and that may end up being just the tip of the iceberg. Wells Fargo will report its third-quarter results before the market opens on Oct. 14. Investors will be looking for answers, and with pressure on CEO John Stumpf to resign following two blistering congressional hearings, an executive shakeup could be in the cards. The company may not go into much detail regarding its outlook, but investors will be expecting a plan. Whether Wells Fargo can continue to be one of the best performing big banks following this scandal remains to be seen. Intel Chip-giant Intel will report its third-quarter results after the market close on Oct. 18. The stock is sitting near decade highs, with continued data-center growth and an improving market for PCs boosting the stock in recent months. Intel raised its third-quarter guidance in September, boosting its revenue outlook by $700 million, driven by replenishment of PC supply-chain inventory and improving PC demand. News that Intel was supplying modems for a portion of Apple's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus phones no doubt contributed to the stock's recent performance. Advanced Micro Devices will make an attempt to claw back share in both the PC CPU and server CPU markets next year with its upcoming Zen processors, but Intel remains the overwhelming leader for the time being. The PC market is still slumping, with IDC reporting a 4.5% year-over-year unit shipment decline during the second quarter. That decline, however, was smaller than expected, raising hopes that the market could stabilize sooner rather than later, an event that would be a boon for Intel. General Motors Following a strong September, General Motors has gained U.S retail market share in 15 of the past 18 months. With the stock trading at barely more than five times General Motors' guidance for full-year adjusted earnings, the market is betting that plateauing demand for vehicles in the U.S. will devastate the company's bottom line. General Motors has yet to show any signs that this will be the case. General Motors will report its third-quarter results before the market opens on Oct. 25. The company has beaten analyst estimates across the board for four quarters in a row. With analysts expecting a small drop in earnings during the third quarter, General Motors may have yet another surprise up its sleeve. Investors should also be on the lookout for more details on the upcoming launch of the Chevy Bolt, General Motors' affordable electric car. With a range of more than 200 miles and a price tag below $30,000 after incentives, the Bolt is proof that General Motors still knows how to innovate. Netflix Streaming-giant Netflix gave investors quite the scare in July. The company added just 1.68 million subscribers globally, down from 3.28 million during the prior-year period. The company's guidance was also nothing to write home about, with 2.3 million subscribers expected to be added during the third quarter, down from 3.62 million during the third quarter of 2015. Netflix will report its third-quarter results after the market close on Oct. 17. Netflix has spent heavily expanding into international markets in recent years, and the company's bottom line has nearly disappeared as a result. But with that expansion now complete, Netflix will need to produce both robust subscriber growth and improving profitability going forward in order to justify its optimistic valuation. Another disappointment could send the stock tumbling. Timothy Green owns shares of General Motors. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple, Netflix, and Wells Fargo.

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. A drone with a RealSense 3D camera built using Intel's Aero Compute Board. Credit: Intel More like this Intel's new computer can serve as the brains of robots Intel's new hardware kits make it easier to build robots and drones Intel's build-from-scratch drone kits to take off next month Video Mingis on Tech: From superfast SSDs to Bluetooth locks and solar shingles Want to build a drone at home? Intel is shipping its Aero Compute Board so you can get your unmanned aerial vehicle in the sky. The Aero Compute Board is priced at $399 and is available on Intel's website. It's a complete drone board system in one unit, but you have to buy certain hardware, like rotor blades, separately. Intel has also started selling its new Robotics Development Kit for $249. The board is meant to be the guts of a robot, providing direction, navigation, decision-making and other capabilities. You can build robots at home with this developer kit. The PC market isn't as hot as it used to be, so Intel is getting into new businesses and providing hardware to build drones, robots, smart gadgets and wearables. The boards are for hobbyists, and could be used to develop and test products. Other drone kits in the market include the Qualcomm Snapdragon Flight, and Nvidia's Jetson TK1, which are both priced at $599. Parrot is planning a developer kit called S.L.A.M.dunk, but a shipment date isn't yet available. Otherwise, you can make robots with developer boards like Raspberry Pi. Drones and robots have already dazzled audiences at Intel keynotes. The company has also flown 100 drones above Sydney Harbor, and showed off something similar outside Palm Springs, Calif., earlier this year. A unique feature that sets Intel's new boards apart is the RealSense 3D camera, which provides computer vision to drones and robots. The camera can identify objects, measure distances and avoid obstacles. It is key to helping drones and robots navigate. The Aero Compute Board has LTE, 802.11ac Wi-Fi and a flight controller.  The board uses Airmap SDKs for low-altitude flight management of drones. It has a quad-core Atom X7-Z8700 CPU code-named Cherry Trail, which is also used in the Surface 3. It has 4GB of LPDDR3 RAM, 16GB of flash storage, a micro-SD slot, a micro-HDMI port, and a wide set of connectors for adapters and breakout boards. One surprise is an Altera Max 10 FPGA, which can reprogrammed to deal with multiple input and output mechanisms. The board will be compatible with Linux. Intel also plans to release a "ready-to-fly" drone kit complete with the board, rotors, remote control and other hardware. The kit was announced at Intel Developer Forum in June, but isn't yet on sale. A shipment date isn't available yet. The Robotics Development Kit has an Atom x5-Z8350 chip and integrated graphics. It has 32GB of storage, 4GB of RAM, an HDMI port, a gigabit ethernet slot, four USB 2.0 ports and one USB 3.0 port. It has an Altera Max V FPGA to interface with external devices. The board will be compatible with Ubuntu 14.04 or 16.04. Intel has a smaller computer for robots coming called Euclid, which is essentially a full computer inside a RealSense 3D webcam. It is like having a full computer lodged in the eyes of the robot. It has fewer interfaces, but its small size makes it more feasible to develop actual robotics products.

(GMS) today unveiled powerful new features that significantly boost the S2U "King Cobra" rugged server's capabilities on the battlefield while lowering price. The enhanced S2U server includes dual Intel® Xeon®E5-2600v4 family CPUs, 48TB of ultra-fast storage, integrated Cisco® industrial-strength Embedded Services Router, 20 ports of managed Gigabit Ethernet switch with POE+, up to 1024GB (1TB) of system DDR4 RAM, and an Auxiliary Power Unit(APU) that powers the system and provides backup power for up to 15 minutes for graceful shut-down or suspend-to disk. All of this is engineered into a dense, modular, 2U short-rack (17-inch deep) configuration that packs more functionality in a field-ready size than anything else on the market, at a fraction of the cost of competing systems. Unlike typical embedded servers, which must be replaced in their entirety in the field, the S2U is the industry's only rugged server that is 100 percent subsystem line replacement unit (LRU) capable, allowing any function of the system to be replaced in the field within seconds, for ultimate flexibility and minimal downtime. The new S2U features dual server processors with Intel's latest 14-core Xeon® E5-2658v4 (Broadwell-EP) and ultra-fast DDR4 RAM. Taking advantage of GMS' state-of-the-art, patent-pending packaging and patented RuggedCoolSM (http://www.gms4sbc.com/technologies/cooling) cooling design, these high-performance processors can run at their full rated speed without the need for throttling to maintain reliability. With up to 1024GB of total system DDR4 RAM with error-correction code (ECC), the S2U can run 56 virtual machines with access via the four 10/40 Gigabit and 24 1-Gigabit Ethernet ports. Highest-Performance for Demanding Applications For defense, avionics, data centers, and mobile applications that demand multiple, high-performance networks but can't afford the space and weight of traditional COTS equipment, the S2U is a one-of-a-kind server and router/switch, mass storage, and APU all in a single rugged box. Designed from the ground-up for harsh environments and space-constrained use, the S2U is ideal for applications such as Tactical Operations Centers (TOC), tent-based forward command centers, UAV/UAS control centers, and in-vehicle SIPR/NIPR (red/black) or battlefield networks. "The S2U King Cobra is a breakthrough in server technology," said Sharfi. "For the first time in the server market, the S2U integrates the reliability and upgradability of blade servers such as ATCA as used in large data centers, with the cost effectiveness and COTS utilization of rack-mount PC servers. No server ever has put all the functionality required such as router, managed switch, APU, mass storage, PCIe, and OpenVPX expansion sites in one 2U, 17-inch deep rack-mount or freestanding system." Designed To Survive, Engineered To Serve • No foreign-sourced, commercial motherboards, switches, or power supplies used. The S2U uses the battlefield-proven OpenVPX standard for the CPU board, COM (Ethernet/router) board, and N+1 hot-swappable 600W power supplies. • Most versatile system with more I/O than any other server or workstation. CPU board supports an XMC module, three ExpressMini modules, 12 drive bays or 24 ExpressMini/M.2 modules, and three 3U OpenVPX modules; four full-length PCIe modules can be added for additional functionality. • Customizable, hot-swappable, front-panel drive bays. Supports 12 front-panel drive bays with SAS/SATA and new ultra-fast and reliable PCIe (NVMe) drives, including hot-swap and RAID-control (if desired) by either a RAID controller in the PCIe cage or via the CPU board using Intel's enterprise-class RSTe. S2U Demos at AUSA Booth #7549 GMS will be demonstrating the new S2U features in booth #7549 at the Association of the United States Army (AUSA) (http://www.gms4sbc.com/ausa) Meeting, October 3-5, 2016 in Washington, DC. Base price for S2U with dual CPU, 128GB RAM, and 500W power supply is under $10,000.

So where were all the Canadian venture capital funds? Oct 4, 2016 Catherine McIntyre   The Myo arm band, Thalmic Labs’ first product. (Thalmic Labs) Thalmic Labs announced recently that it raised a whopping $158 million in funding, a deal that’s being touted as one of the biggest venture capital investment in Canadian history—second only to Hootsuite’s $171 million in 2013. But Canadian VC firms were largely absent from the round, which was led by Intel Capital. Although the country’s venture capital ecosystem is slowly improving (Canadian firms invested $2.3 billion in 2015, compared with $1.9 billion in 2013), VCs are still not equipped to participate in blockbuster deals. Thalmic Labs CEO Stephen Lake on mainstreaming wearables “The short answer to why there weren’t more [Canadian investors] is: There are no VCs that can write a cheque this size,” says Stephen Lake, Thalmic co-founder and CEO. “We don’t really have anyone of that scale in Canada.” After Intel, the Amazon Alexa Fund and Fidelity Investments Canada (a mutual fund company, not a VC) were the biggest investors. iNovia Capital in Montreal was the only Canadian VC to contribute funding, along with a handful of other small Canadian investors whose contributions accounted for a tiny portion of the overall fund. It’s little wonder deep-pocketed investors were willing to make big bets on Thalmic Labs, a wearable tech company and one of Canada’s startup darlings. The four-year-old firm got its start at Y Combinator, the prestigious Silicon Valley accelerator, where its Myo arm band—which lets users control any mobile device by measuring electrical signals triggered by the muscle movements associated with certain hand gestures—won praise and attention. Following the program, the company secured $14.5 million in Series A funding to commercialize the Myo. Today, the device is used to assist surgery, control prosthetic limbs and play video games, among other applications. When it came time to raise another round, Lake says Thalmic, based in Kitchener-Waterloo, Ont., did approach Canadian venture capital investors. “In the end, the one Canadian VC who was large enough to potentially participate substantially had previously decided the company was not a fit for them and had passed on investing.” (Lake declined to name the firm.) In fact, the largest VC companies in Canada control between $500 million and $600 million in assets, while the top American VCs have upwards of US$4 billion to invest. “The largest venture investors we have are writing maybe $10- to $20-million cheques at the high end,” says Lake. “For a $120-million round, you can imagine the large investors were significantly bigger than that.” While Lake suggests that OMERS Ventures (which contributed $20 million to Hootsuite in 2013) could have participated in Thalmic’s latest round, he adds that “even for them, this would probably be too large, given their fund size.” For Georgian Partners, another prominent Canadian VC firm (it has backed the likes of Shopify and FreshBooks), the nature of the Thalmic deal simply wasn’t in their wheelhouse. “We invest in enterprise software companies…while Thalmic Labs is a maker of a sophisticated hardware device,” explains Jane Podbelskaya, senior associate at Georgian Partners. How Tony Lacavera is helping Canadian startups cross the "Valley of Death" Canadian startups are enjoying more and bigger venture capital deals (in the first quarter of 2016, venture capital investments reached $838 million, nearly double what they were for the same period the year before), but the VC community, lacking size and versatility, is not keeping pace with their funding needs. Anthony Lacavera, the founder of Wind Mobile turned VC investor, told Canadian Business earlier this year that the situation means entrepreneurs sell out prematurely or get wooed across the border by U.S. investors. “We’re actually gift-wrapping investment opportunities for these people,” he said. “I think it’s a shame that Canadian VCs are left out of deals like this,” says John Albright, co-founder and managing partner at Relay Ventures. “Thalmic is an incredible company, and it’s a romantic idea to be part of it.” Still, he’s not convinced the source of funds is ultimately that important. Sean Wise, assistant professor of entrepreneurship and strategy at Ryerson University, agrees. “So long as the company stays Canadian, it doesn’t matter where the funding comes from,” he says. For Lake, selecting an investor with appropriate expertise is more important than nationality. “The number one priority is finding the right partner that’s going to help us be successful,” he says. Intel, a long-standing Thalmic investor, for example, carries brand recognition useful for the company’s global expansion plans. Meanwhile, the Alexa Fund, which supports voice technology innovation, offers a subtle hint at Thalmic’s next product. “There’s no specific partnerships we’re announcing right now with Amazon,” says Lake, “but we’re certainly excited to work with them and figure out how we can bring Alexa into wearables.” “Ultimately,” Lake continues, “it’s a net benefit when you see venture deals happen with major Canadian companies and major U.S. investors. It’s blowing capital into the community here while also establishing ties and partnerships to the U.S. and to Silicon Valley, in particular.” Axiom Zen is building a startup that builds startups MORE ABOUT VENTURE CAPITAL, STARTUPS & TECHNOLOGY: Thalmic Labs CEO Stephen Lake on bringing wearable tech to the mainstream How Tony Lacavera is helping Canadian startups cross the “Valley of Death” Axiom Zen is building a startup that builds startups Nearly half the jobs in Canada are at “high risk” of automation How MBA schools are pushing students to build up their data literacy skills Shopify CEO Tobias Lütke on how to maintain a startup culture at scale How Stratford, Ontario, is luring global startups with its smart-city plan How Canada’s immigration policy is failing high-tech startups Fintech firms are battling banks—and the banks are winning The smartest startups invest in their sales team early and often Venture capital funding is rushing into machine learning startups Why Canada’s tech startups need to prepare for a funding slowdown After years in the slow lane, Canada’s e-commerce ecosystem is booming Is Canada finally developing a sustainable startup ecosystem?

Intel Rolls Out 19.0.1607 and 19.10.1635 Bluetooth Drivers - Download Now The files are compatible with Windows 7, 8.1, and 10 OSes Oct 4, 2016 08:02 GMT  ·  By Iulian Pascal  ·  Share:  Intel has rolled out two new Wireless Bluetooth versions targeted at several of its adapters, namely the 19.0.1607 driver compatible with Windows 7 and the 19.10.1635 update suitable for Windows 8.1 and 10 operating systems, either 32- or 64-bit architectures. In terms of supported components, the available files can be used on system configurations that include one of Intel’s Wireless-AC 17265 and 18260 Tri-Band adapters, or a Wireless-AC 3160, 3165, 3168, 7265, 8260, or 8265 Dual Band controller. Moreover, Intel’s update can also be used along with its Wireless-N 7260 and 7265, Dual Band Wireless-N 7260, and Dual Band Wireless-AC 7260 (for Desktop) devices. However, bear in mind that the producer’s Wireless-AC 8260 and 8265 dual band, as well as its Wireless-AC 18260 Tri-Band products, aren’t compatible with the 32-bit architectures of Windows 8.1 and 10 platforms. With this in mind, if you intend to apply these releases, first of all save the appropriate package for your system OS and bit variant, run it and wait for all required files to be extracted, follow all instructions, and perform a reboot once completed.

Might Be Working on an ARM-Based Mac It's not just a rumor anymore. Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Oct 3, 2016 at 7:47PM The A10 Fusion is truly a desktop-class chip. Image source: Apple. Speculation has persisted for half a decade that Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) may be working on an ARM-based Mac, which in turn suggests that Apple could slowly transition away from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) as its processor supplier. From vague executive comments to rumors of ARM-based prototype Macs, there have been many different types of leaks and evidence that an ARM-based Mac will one day be a reality. We're now getting even more evidence that such a device is in the pipeline. A storm is brewing In the latest version of macOS Sierra 10.12 that Apple just released to the public, the Mac maker quietly added support for ARM-based chip architectures within the operation system kernel. Specifically, there was indication for supporting a "Hurricane" chip family. This may be a reference to a custom Apple A chip, as prior generations were codenamed Cyclone (A7), Typhoon (A8), and Twister (A9). The new A10 Fusion chip's internal code name has not been discovered quite yet, so it's possible that Hurricane refers to the A10 Fusion. It's worth pointing out that the A10 Fusion chip found inside the iPhone 7 is theoretically faster than all of the MacBook Airs (which run on Intel chips), according to the popular Geekbench benchmark. The new quad-core processor is even comparable to some MacBook Pros from 2013. While the scores aren't 100% comparable due to a variety of factors, the point still stands that Apple's chip team has made incredible progress and the A10 Fusion is a monster of a chip. It then stands to reason that if Apple really wanted to, it could conceivably design a chip that could satisfy low-end performance requirements like what the MacBook or MacBook Air need. Keep in mind that the A10 Fusion's performance is limited by physical and thermal constraints, since we're talking about a smartphone processor. A more appropriate candidate would be something like an A10X Fusion, which is rumored to power the 2017 iPad Pro. The X variants offer higher performance, often including additional graphics cores, and don't face the same types of limitations. Imagine what Apple could do if it was designing a chip for a laptop form factor. If you can't beat 'em, join 'em There's another distinct possibility here. It just so happens that Intel announced in August that it reached a licensing agreement with ARM Holdings (NASDAQ:ARMH) to manufacture ARM-based chips at its foundries. That was a landmark deal that downplayed the long-standing competition between ARM-based chipmakers and Intel, underscoring that there's more to gain by collaborating. Intel may now produce ARM-based chips for both Apple and Qualcomm, opening up a massive portion of the mobile market that Intel's foundry strategy can address. Taking this a step further, it's not inconceivable that Apple could collaborate with Intel on designing some world-class ARM-based processors for both iOS and macOS devices in the future. Apple's A chips may not be able to compete with Intel at the high end of the spectrum, but Apple could conceivably start at the low end with Apple-designed, Intel-produced chips.

Might Be Working on an ARM-Based Mac It's not just a rumor anymore. Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Oct 3, 2016 at 7:47PM The A10 Fusion is truly a desktop-class chip. Image source: Apple. Speculation has persisted for half a decade that Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) may be working on an ARM-based Mac, which in turn suggests that Apple could slowly transition away from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) as its processor supplier. From vague executive comments to rumors of ARM-based prototype Macs, there have been many different types of leaks and evidence that an ARM-based Mac will one day be a reality. We're now getting even more evidence that such a device is in the pipeline.

It was thinner and lighter than most ultraportables on the market, and its refined design brought over some cues from Apple's mobile hardware. So it was only a matter of time before a PC maker took a swing at a similar design. Enter the ASUS ZenBook 3, a minuscule machine that promises to be just as portable as the MacBook while packing in much faster hardware. But while ASUS has proved it can sell powerful machines for far less than the competition, it's less experienced when it comes to delivering truly premium hardware. The ZenBook 3, while attractive on the surface, is a reminder that ASUS still has a lot to learn. Gallery: ASUS ZenBook 3 review | 10 Photos 10 +6 Engadget Score Poor Uninspiring Good Excellent Key ASUS ZenBook 3 from $749+ Buy Now 76 Pros Thin and light design comparable to the MacBook As fast as other high-end ultraportables Vibrant screen Comes with a mini-dock for extra ports Cons Keyboard and trackpad are difficult to use Fingerprint sensor placement makes no sense Build quality is suspect Summary The ZenBook 3 does a decent job of mimicking the MacBook's design while also cramming in faster hardware. But the combination of a hard-to-use keyboard and trackpad, along with build quality concerns, make it difficult to recommend. Hardware At first glance, the Zenbook 3 screams luxury. Its aluminum alloy case is smooth and sleek, and it measures an impressive 11.9mm at its thickest point. I particularly liked the deep shade of blue and the gold accents, which are classy in a subtle way. ASUS's ZenBook line is unquestionably "Apple-inspired," with an emphasis on thin profiles and all-metal cases. But the ZenBook 3's design in particular looks like a mixture of the MacBook and the 11-inch MacBook Air, right down to the small notch below the trackpad and the look of the speakers above the keyboard. That's one way to evoke a premium feel, I guess. But it would have been nice to see some actual innovation, as with HP's sexy new Spectre. With a 12.5-inch display, ASUS managed to outdo the MacBook by half an inch. But Apple's laptop boasts a higher-resolution 2,304 x 1,440 display, as compared with 1080p on the ZenBook. At least it's a good-looking display, though; it's bright enough for outdoor use, while colors appear vibrant and mostly accurate. Though it's not a touchscreen display (that's to be expected with such a thin laptop), ASUS covered it in Gorilla Glass 4 for extra protection. After testing out plenty of touchscreen Windows laptops over the past few years, though, I'm surprised by how much I missed that feature here. While the two-pound ZenBook 3 feels light and sturdy at first, it wasn't long before I started noticing flaws. Applying a bit of pressure around the laptop's keyboard leads to some seriously disturbing creaking noises, as if the seams around the bottom of the case are rubbing against each other. It's not something you might ever do to your laptop, but this also doesn't bode well for long-term durability. If a bit of force from my hands can disturb the case's integrity, how can I ever trust it in a book bag with other heavy items? Then there's the keyboard and trackpad, which present a different set of issues. The ZenBook 3's buttons have more travel than those on the relatively flat MacBook, but the feedback you get when pressing them is mushy and insubstantial. Perhaps it's just because I'm a heavy typer, but I was never able to get into a decent typing flow. While I eventually got used to the wonky feedback, I still get more typos with this machine compared with every other laptop keyboard I've tested recently. Honestly, even though the MacBook's keyboard isn't ideal either, I still prefer it to the ZenBook 3's. The trackpad, while large and relatively smooth, is a chore to use. It requires a lot of pressure to register clicks, which isn't great when you're trying to balance an ultralight notebook on your lap. It would often get confused with left and right clicks, and on several occasions I had to press down multiple times for it to register anything. Tapping the trackpad to select things isn't great either, as it often moves the pointer off your target. And for some reason, ASUS thought it was a good idea to put its fingerprint sensor right on the trackpad. That effectively renders the top-right portion of the trackpad a dead zone most of the time. At least the fingerprint sensor works well; it usually gets me to the desktop in less than a second. On several occasions, I received warnings about Windows Hello being disabled because of too many fingerprint login attempts, even after I was just waking it up from sleep mode. I'm not sure why those errors occurred, but it makes me think that Windows Hello is somehow trying to identify fingerprints even when the ZenBook's lid is shut. (And that could be tied to the flexing issue as well.) You might have noticed one other nod to the MacBook: The ZenBook 3's only ports are a single USB-C socket and a 3.5mm headphone jack. At least ASUS was kind enough to bundle in a USB-C mini-dock, which includes an HDMI port, a traditional USB connection and another USB-C socket. Unfortunately, you can use the dock's USB-C port only for charging, which will make life difficult if you want to connect a USB-C device and an external monitor at the same time.

Our review unit came with a Core i7-7500U, which offers speeds between 2.7GHz and 2.9GHz, and 16GB of LPDDR3 RAM clocked at 2,133MHz. ASUS says it worked with Intel to achieve that memory speed, which is faster than any other ultraportable on the market. It even exceeds the maximum 1,866MHz RAM speeds Intel officially supports for its latest chips. The MacBook, on the other hand, is still stuck with slow Core m3 and m5 CPUs and a maximum of 8GB of RAM. Apple might refresh it soon, now that the seventh-gen Intel CPUs are available, but for the time being, ASUS wins the spec battle. The ZenBook 3 felt just as zippy as other high-end ultraportables. It didn't skip a beat during my typical workflow, which involves having several browsers open with dozens of tabs each, plus Slack, Spotify and Photoshop. And thanks to the video-decoding capabilities in Intel's new processors, the CPU usage managed to stay below 20 percent when I streamed 4K video from YouTube. Basically, you're not sacrificing any performance here. Battery life ASUS ZenBook 3 9:45 Surface Book (Core i5, integrated graphics) 13:54 / 3:20 (tablet only) HP Spectre x360 (13-inch, 2015) 11:34 Surface Book (Core i7, discrete graphics) 11:31 / 3:02 (tablet only) Apple MacBook Pro with Retina display (13-inch, 2015) 11:23 iPad Pro (12.9-inch, 2015) 10:47 HP Spectre x360 15t 10:17 Chromebook Pixel (2015) 10:01 Lenovo Yoga 900 9:36 Apple MacBook (2016) 8:45 Samsung Notebook 9 8:16 Dell XPS 13 (2015) 7:36 Microsoft Surface Pro 4 7:15 HP Spectre 13 7:07 Huawei MateBook 6:35 Razer Blade Stealth 5:48 Dell XPS 15 (2016) 5:25 (7:40 with the mobile charger) When it comes to real-world battery life, the ZenBook 3 also outshines some recent ultraportables I've seen, like the Huawei MateBook and the Lenovo X1 Yoga with OLED. It typically lasted an entire workday, and sometimes it even had juice left over by the time I got home. In our typical battery test, which involves looping an HD video until the power dies, it lasted around nine hours and 45 minutes. Given that Intel is stressing video decoding with its new chips, though, that figure might not be directly comparable to other ultraportables. I'll be testing the ZenBook 3 with other battery benchmarks soon and will report back with the results. Configuration options and the competition You have two choices with the ZenBook: the $1,099 model with a Core i5-7200U processor, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage; or the more powerful $1,599 version with a Core i7-7500U chip, 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. The latter model was the one I tested, so keep that in mind if you're hoping to achieve the kind of performance reflected in our benchmarks. Apple's MacBook, which is really the only direct competitor, starts at $1,299, with a significantly slower Core M3 CPU, 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. Bumping up to $1,599 gets you a Core M5 and more storage, but you'll still be stuck with 8GB of RAM. If you can live with something slightly heavier, then you've got a wealth of ultraportable options to choose from, including HP's revamped Spectre 13 (2.45 pounds), the fantastic Dell XPS 13 (2.6 pounds), and even Microsoft's Surface Pro 4. All of those machines will likely get upgraded soon with Intel's seventh-gen CPUs, so it might be worth waiting a bit (or snap up one of last year's models if they're on sale). Wrap-up Ultimately, with the ZenBook 3, ASUS did what it does best: pack in plenty of powerful hardware for a cheaper price than the competition. But the company's inexperience at crafting truly high-end machines shows, with some truly worrying durability and usability issues. I give ASUS credit for building such a thin and powerful device, but what does that matter if the keyboard and trackpad are a pain to use?

Perhaps it's just because I'm a heavy typer, but I was never able to get into a decent typing flow. While I eventually got used to the wonky feedback, I still get more typos with this machine compared with every other laptop keyboard I've tested recently. Honestly, even though the MacBook's keyboard isn't ideal either, I still prefer it to the ZenBook 3's. The trackpad, while large and relatively smooth, is a chore to use. It requires a lot of pressure to register clicks, which isn't great when you're trying to balance an ultralight notebook on your lap. It would often get confused with left and right clicks, and on several occasions I had to press down multiple times for it to register anything. Tapping the trackpad to select things isn't great either, as it often moves the pointer off your target. And for some reason, ASUS thought it was a good idea to put its fingerprint sensor right on the trackpad. That effectively renders the top-right portion of the trackpad a dead zone most of the time. At least the fingerprint sensor works well; it usually gets me to the desktop in less than a second. On several occasions, I received warnings about Windows Hello being disabled because of too many fingerprint login attempts, even after I was just waking it up from sleep mode. I'm not sure why those errors occurred, but it makes me think that Windows Hello is somehow trying to identify fingerprints even when the ZenBook's lid is shut. (And that could be tied to the flexing issue as well.) You might have noticed one other nod to the MacBook: The ZenBook 3's only ports are a single USB-C socket and a 3.5mm headphone jack. At least ASUS was kind enough to bundle in a USB-C mini-dock, which includes an HDMI port, a traditional USB connection and another USB-C socket. Unfortunately, you can use the dock's USB-C port only for charging, which will make life difficult if you want to connect a USB-C device and an external monitor at the same time.

Our review unit came with a Core i7-7500U, which offers speeds between 2.7GHz and 2.9GHz, and 16GB of LPDDR3 RAM clocked at 2,133MHz. ASUS says it worked with Intel to achieve that memory speed, which is faster than any other ultraportable on the market. It even exceeds the maximum 1,866MHz RAM speeds Intel officially supports for its latest chips. The MacBook, on the other hand, is still stuck with slow Core m3 and m5 CPUs and a maximum of 8GB of RAM. Apple might refresh it soon, now that the seventh-gen Intel CPUs are available, but for the time being, ASUS wins the spec battle. The ZenBook 3 felt just as zippy as other high-end ultraportables. It didn't skip a beat during my typical workflow, which involves having several browsers open with dozens of tabs each, plus Slack, Spotify and Photoshop. And thanks to the video-decoding capabilities in Intel's new processors, the CPU usage managed to stay below 20 percent when I streamed 4K video from YouTube. Basically, you're not sacrificing any performance here. Battery life ASUS ZenBook 3 9:45 Surface Book (Core i5, integrated graphics) 13:54 / 3:20 (tablet only) HP Spectre x360 (13-inch, 2015) 11:34 Surface Book (Core i7, discrete graphics) 11:31 / 3:02 (tablet only) Apple MacBook Pro with Retina display (13-inch, 2015) 11:23 iPad Pro (12.9-inch, 2015) 10:47 HP Spectre x360 15t 10:17 Chromebook Pixel (2015) 10:01 Lenovo Yoga 900 9:36 Apple MacBook (2016) 8:45 Samsung Notebook 9 8:16 Dell XPS 13 (2015) 7:36 Microsoft Surface Pro 4 7:15 HP Spectre 13 7:07 Huawei MateBook 6:35 Razer Blade Stealth 5:48 Dell XPS 15 (2016) 5:25 (7:40 with the mobile charger) When it comes to real-world battery life, the ZenBook 3 also outshines some recent ultraportables I've seen, like the Huawei MateBook and the Lenovo X1 Yoga with OLED. It typically lasted an entire workday, and sometimes it even had juice left over by the time I got home. In our typical battery test, which involves looping an HD video until the power dies, it lasted around nine hours and 45 minutes. Given that Intel is stressing video decoding with its new chips, though, that figure might not be directly comparable to other ultraportables. I'll be testing the ZenBook 3 with other battery benchmarks soon and will report back with the results. Configuration options and the competition You have two choices with the ZenBook: the $1,099 model with a Core i5-7200U processor, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage; or the more powerful $1,599 version with a Core i7-7500U chip, 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. The latter model was the one I tested, so keep that in mind if you're hoping to achieve the kind of performance reflected in our benchmarks. Apple's MacBook, which is really the only direct competitor, starts at $1,299, with a significantly slower Core M3 CPU, 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. Bumping up to $1,599 gets you a Core M5 and more storage, but you'll still be stuck with 8GB of RAM. If you can live with something slightly heavier, then you've got a wealth of ultraportable options to choose from, including HP's revamped Spectre 13 (2.45 pounds), the fantastic Dell XPS 13 (2.6 pounds), and even Microsoft's Surface Pro 4. All of those machines will likely get upgraded soon with Intel's seventh-gen CPUs, so it might be worth waiting a bit (or snap up one of last year's models if they're on sale). Wrap-up Ultimately, with the ZenBook 3, ASUS did what it does best: pack in plenty of powerful hardware for a cheaper price than the competition. But the company's inexperience at crafting truly high-end machines shows, with some truly worrying durability and usability issues. I give ASUS credit for building such a thin and powerful device, but what does that matter if the keyboard and trackpad are a pain to use?

This is a high-end estimate, which includes both games, any Day 1 updates, as well as the additional Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered multiplayer maps to be released before Dec. 31, 2016. Original Story: Discovered by Charlie Intel, French retailer Micromania is giving out empty Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare Legacy Edition boxes along with the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered Campaign early access codes. According to the back of the box, the Legacy Edition, which comes with a physical version of Infinite Warfare and digital version of Modern Warfare Remastered, requires a minimum of 130GB of free space. So far, we know the MWR Campaign early access is a 40GB download, which could also be the size of the full game. If it is, that means Infinite Warfare takes up 90GB on its own. Of course, it’s possible the PS4 Pro support and PlayStation VR mission take up a good chunk of that space, and the files for the additional Modern Warfare Remastered maps (Bloc, Countdown, Pipeline, Showdown, Strike, Wet Work) coming in December may also be included in the 130GB estimate. If you pre-ordered one of the Infinite Warfare special editions, the MWR Campaign early access is now live on the PlayStation Store. As Activision explains, after November 3 you’ll have to install the full version of MWR to keep playing: The early access period will end on November 3rd. On launch day, you must install the full version of Modern Warfare Remastered that is included with the Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare Legacy Edition, Legacy Pro Edition, Digital Legacy Edition or Digital Deluxe Edition. Please note: Any progress made in the Campaign during the early access period will carry over to the launch version. This means you can continue the Campaign where you left off, or you may choose to restart from the beginning. Activision has also confirmed that physical buyers of one of the Infinite Warfare special editions must have the game disc inserted in order to play Modern Warfare Remastered. Infinite Warfare and Modern Warfare Remastered release on November 4 for PS4, Xbox One, and PC. The Closed Beta begins on October 14 for PS4 players who pre-ordered.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Wacom MobileStudio Pro tablets can scan your Starbucks cup by Bruno Ferreira  12:09 PM on October 5, 2016 Greetings, artistic-minded gerbils everywhere. We have some goodies for you today, courtesy of Wacom. The digital art gear company is proudly showing off the MobileStudio Pro, the successor to its Cintiq lineup of art-oriented tablet PCs. Besides some nifty specs, the machines can be configured with an Intel RealSense R200 3D camera for  scanning purposes. The MobileStudio Pro comes in 13" and 16" sizes. The 13" model has a 2560x1440 IPS screen capable of reproducing 96% of the Adobe RGB color space. The machine is powered by Skylake Core i5 or Core i7 CPUs and 4GB to 16GB of RAM. Storage comes by way of SSDs ranging from 64GB to 512GB. An SDXC card slot allows for further expansion, while three USB Type-C ports provide peripheral connectivity. Wacom says the MobileStudio Pro 13's 52-Wh battery should be good for 6 hours of work. The most powerful model in this range comes with an Intel RealSense R200 3D camera—just the ticket for object-scanning goodness. The bigger MobileStudio Pro 16 is similar to its smaller brother—only bigger and better. The screen on this unit offers a 3840x2160 resolution and should cover 94% of the Adobe RGB color space. Buyers get two choices for this model. The first option packs a Core i5 CPU along with a Nvidia Quadro M600M graphics card, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD. The spiffier model gets a Core i7 CPU, a Nvidia M1000M card, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. The higher-end version also includes a RealSense R200 3D camera, too. Wacom designed a new stylus to go with the tablets. The Wacom Pro Pen 2 can get pretty touchy-feely with its 8192 levels of pressure and 60° tilt detection. The company says the new pen is four times more accurate than the previous model, too, and has "virtually no lag" and no parallax deviation. The stylus needs no batteries or charging. We should note that the MobileStudio Pro only offers video output through its USB Type-C ports. The optional Wacom Link dock offers DisplayPort and USB connectors. The dock also allows users to plug the MobileStudio Pro into another computer and use it as a simple drawing tablet. Prices for the MobileStudio Pro 13" start at $1,499 for a model with a Core i5 CPU, 4GB of RAM, and a 64GB SSD. A sum of $1,799 gets you an upgrade to 8GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD. There are two Core i7-equipped models on tap: one with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage at $1,999, and a high-end model with 16GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, and a RealSense R200 camera. Meanwhile, the base MobileStudio Pro 16 model goes for $2,399. The version packing the RealSense camera, 16GB of RAM, 512GB SSD, and a Quadro M1000M goes for $2,999. Aspiring artists can get their hands on these goods in late November.

The sunglasses come with built-in earbuds that allow the sunglasses to respond to voice commands. You can ask how far you’ve traveled and your pace, and your voice assistant "coach" will respond along with encouragement to keep going. The sunglasses are also outfitted with a bunch of sensors, including an accelerometer and gyroscope. They can also apparently detect pressure, humidity, and proximity. The gradient on the sunglasses’ lens is called "Prizm Road." I enjoy it. It reminds me of Word art or PowerPoint slides. The sunglasses pair with your phone through Bluetooth and can be controlled through the Radar Pace’s companion Android / iOS app. If you don’t feel like using voice controls or the app, there’s also a touch pad on the sunglasses where you can skip songs, take phone calls, and adjust the volume. Will we all wear talking gradients on our faces in the future? The Radar Pace costs $449.

Photo credit: Graphic: Intel Security | Share | Share | Share | Share Female comedian superstar Amy Schumer is the most dangerous celebrity to search for online, according this year's "McAfee Most Dangerous Celebrities" study, published by Intel Security. While employers hope their employees are not searching for entertainment at work, security and IT directors must be aware of this data and communicate it to organizations, as many search results leads to malicious websites that could expose users to viruses and malware. Savvy cybercriminals continue to leverage consumers’ ongoing fascination with celebrity news – such as award and TV shows as well as movie premieres, album releases, celebrity breakups and more – to entice unsuspecting fans to visit sites loaded with malware that can steal passwords and personal information. The study highlights various ways hackers can take advantage of employees' interest around pop culture news, the risks of their online behavior and how to best protect themselves from potential threats. “Consumers today remain fascinated with celebrity culture and go online to find the latest pop culture news,” Intel Security's Gary Davis said in a statement. “With this craving for real-time information, many search and click without considering potential security risks. Cybercriminals know this and take advantage of this behavior by attempting to lead them to unsafe sites loaded with malware." Schumer is followed on the list by Justin Bieber and Carson Daly. A search for ‘Amy Schumer Torrent’ results in a 33-percent chance of connecting to a malicious website. The report urges users to use caution when searching for “torrent,” which is by far the riskiest search term. Cybercriminals can use torrents to embed malware within authentic files making it difficult to determine if a file is safe.  The top 10 celebrities from this year’s study with the highest risk percentages include:                       Position         Celebrity         Percentage 1         Amy Schumer         16.11% 2         Justin Bieber         15.00% 3         Carson Daly         13.44% 4         Will Smith         13.44% 5         Rihanna         13.33% 6         Miley Cyrus         12.67% 7         Chris Hardwick         12.56% 8         Daniel Tosh         11.56% 9         Selena Gomez         11.11% 10         Kesha         11.11%                       To learn more about the study, visit https://blogs.mcafee.com/consumer/most-dangerous-celebrities-2016.

A typical response to those who dare to criticise Israel is to use smear tactics, labelling proponents of the Palestinian-led Boycott Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign hypocrites for continuing to use Israeli-designed technology. Unfortunately for anti-Palestinian fanatics, such as the DUP’s Gary Middleton, this narrative of demanding boycotters to give up their iPads or Intel processing chips just doesn’t hold up to scrutiny - especially once we unpack and explore this matter in some detail. The BDS campaign’s website makes clear that it [BDS] is “a strategy for effective solidarity and not a dogma or ideology.” In fact, there are clear guidelines provided by Palestinians on how international activists, politicians and policy makers can ensure the BDS movement is impactful in the right areas. One of their most widely used and easily accessible resources is a section on ‘what to boycott’, which places emphasis on targeting boycotts at companies and investments that are “most deeply involved in Israel’s occupation and apartheid.” Demands being made that councillors who support BDS should ‘stop using their iPads’ or repeating the callous, ugly and ableist request for Prof. Stephen Hawking, who suffers from an acute and slowly progressing form of motor neurone disease, to rip out the intel chip which allows him to interact with the world and people around him, are nothing short of hysterical smears that rely on a puerile and repulsive notion that because Israel is a scientific and technological leader in the world today that it is automatically exempt from any criticism for its violations of international law and constant violent oppression of the Palestinian people. As Israeli activist Yossi Gurvitz put it in a 2013 article; this is “redemption through technology” and designed to make us overlook human rights violations on the basis that “Israeli technology is somehow viewed as indispensable to modern life.” Gurvitz continues by highlighting that this is a conflation between the activities of individual Israelis or Israeli companies and Israel’s political pursuits. He then cites an American blogger who noted that this minor psychosis is quite strange in many respects, not least because whenever someone criticises the United States government, it does not occur to the respondent to say “but we gave the world a whole range of Apple products!” - because in any typical argument this would be laughable. Taking actions such as a boycott campaign against a human rights violator doesn’t suddenly become invalid simply because said violator has citizens who have provided the world with technological, scientific or medicinal advances. I was also surprised that the News Letter uncritically cited Shurat HaDin without mentioning the organisations ties to both the Israeli government and Israeli spy agency Mossad. Presenting this organisation as an “Israel law centre” is not strictly accurate and doesn’t inform readers of the fact it takes instructions directly from the Israeli government. The boycott divestment and sanctions campaign is designed to be strategic and promote a sustained, long-term challenge to Israel’s regime of occupation, settler-colonialism and apartheid. BDS does NOT target individual Israeli citizens and it certainly doesn’t call for, or endorse, racism, hatred or discrimination of any kind. There isn’t as great a “practical difficulty involved in carrying out an effective boycott of Israel” as Gary Middleton and other anti-Palestinian fanatics would have us believe. It’s a case of Derry and Strabane council coming together to decide an ethical trading policy, ensuring a clear strategy is in place to identify and boycott specific companies, all whilst applying a human rights standard on procurement and investment decisions as a starting point. Supporters of human rights and justice everywhere should welcome to decision for Derry and Strabane council to back the Palestinian-led BDS campaign.

RIFT.io will show the integration of a variety of MANO on-boarded virtual network function (VNF) and virtual infrastructure manager (VIM) offerings from the industry's top providers such as Intel, Brocade, WindRiver, 6Wind, F5 and Metaswitch. RIFT.ware is a model-driven, ETSI-compliant NFV MANO solution that simplifies onboarding and deployment of VNFs and the composition and management of complex network services. Many elements of RIFT.ware are also integral to the Open Source MANO (OSM) project, which delivered Release One of its code this week as scheduled. RIFT.io is a founding member of OSM and its significant contributions to this open-source project as well as its on-going commercial development of RIFT.ware exemplify the SDN World Congress stated mission of "advancing the carrier vision of NFV+SDN+MANO".     EVENT: SDN & OpenFlow World Congress     DATES: Oct. 10 - 14, 2016     BOOTH: #110     Carrier-Driven Solution Demos RIFT.io is planning to showcase several real-world and commercially viable solution categories including: Auto-scaling: RIFT.ware provides an auto-scaling framework ideal for VNFs that do not readily support scale-in/scale-out capabilities. This feature enables service providers to deploy services that dynamically create new capacity to meet highly variable demand among their mobile and other service subscriber bases. Specifically, RIFT.io will demonstrate auto-scaling integration with third-party VNFs such as Sprout (virtual IMS) and HAProxy (HTTP Load Balancer). VNF Onboarding and Service Composition: RIFT.ware delivers a step-by-step roadmap for service providers, network application builders, and enterprises to virtualize, automate, and scale their VNFs to enable cloud-ready communications and services. This can being with a simple onboarding of unmodified VNFs and apps that can be evolved to add service velocity and innovation through service composition tools. At SDN World Congress, RIFT.io will demo these capabilities with solutions such as the Brocade vEPC, Intel EPA, and VNF Forwarding Graph (VNFFG) + OpenDaylight integration. Service Provider Solutions: RIFT.io is also planning to demo two of the most popular service provider solutions that RIFT.ware enables specifically virtual CPE (vCPE) and VPN as-a-Service (VPNaaS) that will create new revenue streams and new end-user services for wired, wireless, and mobile operators. Using RIFT.ware in concert with RIFT.ready partner applications, these service providers can quickly onboard multiple-vendor virtual router, IMS, and WAN acceleration VNFs, chain functions together to create a service chain, and instantiate new network services such as vCPE and VPNaaS. RIFT.io will showcase integration between RIFT.ware and the Brocade vCPE operating system to onboard Riverbed Steelhead WAN Optimization and Acceleration VNFs at simulated branch and remote office sites. For VPNaaS, RIFT.io will demonstrate integration with various VNFs from 6Wind, Brocade, F5, and Metaswitch that simulate how service providers can quickly and cost effectively deliver VPN connectivity for their enterprise and SMB customers without dedicated network appliances in points of presence or at the customer premises themselves. To get a first-hand demo of any of these solutions, please visit Booth #110 at the SDN World Congress during expo hours.

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Adapteva's next Epiphany V chip will have 1,024 cores. Credit: Adapteva More like this Adapteva aims 64-core chip at tablets, smartphones Chip maker Adapteva aims to speed up smartphones Open source 25-core chip can grow into a 200,000-core computer Video Mingis on Tech: From superfast SSDs to Bluetooth locks and solar shingles Back in 2010, an Intel researcher said 1,000-core processors would be feasible. We're in that era, and the race to make chips faster and more power efficient is gaining steam. The latest mega-chip is a 1,024-core processor called Epiphany V, which was announced by Adapteva on Wednesday. Adapteva claims it will have enough juice to outperform some of the latest gaming and server processors. It has 24 more cores than the 1,000-core KiloCore, a test chip made by researchers at University of California, Davis. The Epiphany V and KiloCore cram a mind-numbing number of power-efficient cores into small chips. The Epiphany V chip isn't designed for gaming -- it's aimed more at real-time image processing, autonomous driving, and machine learning, said Andreas Olofsson, founder of Adapteva. A hardware enthusiast could build a Linux PC with it, though the chip isn't really designed for PC-type use, Olofsson said. Companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon are building mega data centers to handle a growing number of social media and cloud applications. These servers also handle image recognition and natural language processing. The servers are coming under more stress with the growing influx of data. Olofsson argues the Epiphany V will deliver more performance per watt and square millimeter than x86 chips. That performance will help smaller servers do more. The Epiphany V is based on the RISC architecture, which is different than the x86. The chip is now being manufactured, and it could be tested in computers in the coming months. Availability of the chips could be announced next year. The chip is being fabricated using the 16-nm FinFET process by TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.). TSMC is using the same process to make Nvidia's latest graphics chips. The 1,024-core chip will not be available off the shelf, but Adapteva will work with partners to commercialize the chip, Olofsson said. That process, in itself, could be a challenge considering a lot of time is required to test and validate chips.  Development of the chip was funded bythe U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which played a big role in the development of technologies like GPS and the internet. DARPA has also funded wild ideas that never came to fruition, but Epiphany V looks like it will eventually be available in servers or boards. The Epiphany V is a milestone in the number of cores that can be put on CPUs. Adding cores became a trend when AMD showed the first dual-core x86 chip in 2004. However, one of the first multicore chips was a Power4 processor from IBM in 2001. Putting more cores was an alternative to cranking up the clock speed of CPUs, which caused chips to draw more power. But along with more cores came the challenge of making programs work in parallel. Programming frameworks like OpenCL, which is supported by Epiphany V, have helped write code that harnesses the joint computing power of many cores. The Epiphany V design makes it easy to run applications in parallel. It has a mesh topology, and cores are networked to facilitate communications. It has shared memory accessible to all cores. The topography ensures there is cache coherency, which is important in chips loaded with cores and memory. The shared memory support can expand to more Epiphany chips. The mesh topology, with cores communicating via mini-routers, has been used in research and commercial chips before, but Epiphany V has a different design. Some key details, like overall power consumption, aren't yet known. The power efficiency of the chips determines motherboard and server design, and also the effective performance per watt of the chip. For example, the 1,000-core KiloCore is so power-efficient that it can run on a single AA battery, the UC Davis researchers claimed. Adapteva has released Epiphany chips previously, and also shipped the $99 Parallella board computer with a previous Epiphany chip. The company turned to Kickstarter for funding to develop the board and shipped more than 10,000 units. Olofsson didn't detail how he'd commercialize the new Epiphany V chip.

Chanel Spring/Summer 2017 collection. In his work for Chanel’s spring clothes, designer Karl Lagerfeld focused on the innards of our computers — the data, the algorithms and microchips — instead of the gleaming exterior. (Olivier Claisse/MCV) PARIS — Exquisitely beaded lanyards, tweed baseball caps, luxe laptop bags — are these the trinkets that can satisfy the Chanel customer who fancies herself a tech geek as well as a fashion fiend? They were on the runway alongside an array of dresses in blown-up motherboard prints and jackets that seemed to be woven from colored wires and lights. Chanel Spring/Summer 2017 collection.

(Jonas Gustavsson/MCV photo for The Washington Post) In his work for Chanel, designer Karl Lagerfeld has commented on the wonders of technology before, but for spring 2017, he focused on the innards of our computers — the data, the algorithms and microchips — instead of the gleaming exterior. For some time, fashion has been trying to sort out its relationship with technology, trying to figure out the ways in which computer chips and sensors tucked into clothes can improve our lives, or at least make them more interesting. But beyond the basics — fabrics that excel in keeping us cool or warm — technology and fashion are essentially passing acquaintances. Sometimes uncomfortably so. Hussein Chalayan Spring/Summer 2017 collection. In a collaboration with Intel, Chalayan showed a spring collection in which models wore glasses that picked up their breathing and heart rate and transferred that information to their bulky belts. (Olivier Claisse/MCV) Indeed, the designer Hussein Chalayan, in a collaboration with Intel, showed a spring collection in which models wore glasses that picked up their breathing and heart rate and transferred that information to their bulky belts. The data was then broadcast onto a screen so that the audience could get a gander at the models’ stress levels as they walked by. Which leads one to wonder: Do you really want to know how stressed you are going into a meeting with your boss? Don’t you already know? Hussein Chalayan Spring/Summer 2017 collection. Chalayan’s clothes were quite nice with their easy fit and elongated sleeves. (Helle Moos/MCV photo for The Washington Post) Such technology may, in the future, prove indispensable. Who knew that the ability to photograph every morsel of food you put into your mouth would become so essential to the dining experience? Meanwhile, applaud Chalayan for his intellectual curiosity, ignore Intel’s high-tech fanny packs and just take a look at the clothes, which were quite nice with their easy fit, elongated sleeves and slightly oversize shoulders. Hussein Chalayan Spring/Summer 2017 collection. (Helle Moos/MCV photo for The Washington Post) If the technology aspect at Chalayan was inelegant science and no art, at Chanel, it was all art. Or at least artful commerce. Models wearing the Chanel Spring/Summer 2017 collection. (Helle Moos/MCV photo for The Washington Post) The experience of a Chanel runway show is, even by fashion standards, extreme. Women — and men — fetishize Chanel in a way that fans of other brands do not. They arrive draped in Chanel jackets, skirts, brooches, bags, hats and perfume.  Even the singer Usher, who attended Tuesday’s spring 2017 presentation, was costumed in a black Chanel jacket bedecked with braided trim and brooches and with the double-C logo in crystals on the back. The singer Usher wore a black Chanel jacket bedecked with braided trim and brooches. (Gonzalo Fuentes/Reuters) There is a look-at-me vibe at Chanel that is particularly striking. This season, a flock of young women wafted into the Grand Palais, each trailed by her own photographer. Accompanying stylists proceeded to fluff and powder them for their close-ups; the other guests were just a bunch of extras on the set. Chanel Spring/Summer 2017 collection. (Olivier Claisse/MCV) Chanel is mainstream luxury, meaning that people know the name, associate it with high-end cachet and understand its vernacular.  You do not have to be in the know to know Chanel.

(Jonas Gustavsson/MCV photo for The Washington Post) Chanel Spring/Summer 2017 collection. (Jonas Gustavsson/MCV photo for The Washington Post) Lagerfeld has kept Chanel churning by injecting it with the mood or the story line of the day. (Chanel weathered the recession just fine, but recently profits have dropped.) Tech is currently the story. So Lagerfeld makes that connection. He gives his customers the sense that they are in on the fashion and technology conversation. That they are forward-looking. But he doesn’t let science get in the way of the dresses, the jackets or a few good gewgaws. 1 of 147 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × The scene at Paris Fashion Week View Photos Designers show off their exciting fashions in Paris.

Schneider signed a university proclamation officially launching Cybersecurity Awareness Month at Norwich University, a national leader in cybersecurity and digital forensics education. October is National Cybersecurity Awareness Month, and this year Norwich is taking up the charge of engaging the entire Norwich community and surrounding Northfield and central Vermont community on this important topic with both internal activities and several presentations, which are free and open to the public. On Tuesday, Oct. 11, from 1-2 pm in Plumley Armory, Norwich presents “The Cyber-Threat Landscape,” a keynote presentation by Stacey Wright from the Multi State-Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) of Albany, New York. In this engaging presentation, Wright will introduce the current cyber threat environment and the simple steps everyone can take to protect themselves. The public is welcome and encouraged to attend this talk and to participate in the Q and A after. Wright is the Intel Program Manager at the Center for Internet Security (CIS), where she leads the Intel Team for the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC). The Intel Team focuses on providing strategic, operational, and tactical cyber-threat intelligence on state, local, tribal, and territorial government cyber issues, and is dedicated to providing comprehensive, actionable intelligence analysis. Prior to her employment at CIS, Wright was the Cyber Intelligence Analyst for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Albany Division, where she was responsible for coordinating the local cyber-intelligence program, and served as the FBI's liaison to MS-ISAC. On Thursday, Oct 20, from 2-4 pm in Dole Auditorium, come hear presentations by members of the Albany, NY, FBI. On Thursday, Oct. 27 from 6:30-8 pm in Partridge 125, come hear from Heather Roszkowski NU’00 & M’08,Chief Information Security Officer at University of Vermont Medical Center, a five-hospital system serving the residents of Vermont and northern New York. Roszkowski brings 11 years of experience in communications and computer information security to her position from the U.S. Army. She has worked in healthcare since leaving active duty in 2011. Roszkowski holds Bachelor of Science degrees in Computer Information Systems and Business Management, and a Master of Science in Computer Information Security from Norwich University. In addition to faculty and staff trainings, Norwich University is also offering contests for the Norwich community that will test cyber-knowledge and provide information on cyber-safety and other ways to exercise caution and discretion when using technology. Challenges and quizzes will be offered every Wednesday in October; students will staff a cybersecurity table at the dining hall to answer questions; and there will be various other presentations in classrooms throughout the month.

If you were to design a client operating system with the goal of being used by two billion people, what would it look like? We might soon find out what Alphabet’s looks like. Today’s announcement’s from Alphabet’s Google is expected to reveal "Andromeda", the merged Android/Chrome OS. Executives have been hyping today’s event as the most "significant" since the first Android device in 2008, and we already know they’re writing a new operating system from a clean slate. We can also have a good guess about what it looks like. Google’s goal for the successor is to unify the rival Chrome and Android platforms while providing a clean code base free of the Java legacy. Google’s big advantage here is that it now has a blank slate. After Google acquired Android in 2005, Sun Microsystems’ then CEO Jonathan Schwartz offered Google “congratulations on the announcement of their new Java/Linux phone platform”. Android founder Andy Rubin had already figured Java worked, and seen how it decreased time to market, and how much developers liked it. (Anything was preferable to writing for Symbian, the dominant smartphone platform of the time.) But Google doesn’t need Java any more, and the more distance it puts between itself and its Java-based legacy, the better, particularly if (as it is reasonable to expect) Oracle ultimately prevails in the litigation on appeal. Nor does it need, at least not quite so much, the VM-based architecture designed to make porting easy. If OS abstraction is sufficiently well designed, then an easily-ported microkernel can suffice. Microsoft took this approach designing Windows NT, although within three years Redmond had broken the microkernel design (moving graphics drivers into the kernel) and a couple of years after that, the last non-Intel port had been mothballed. By then it was, to all intents and purposes, a monolithic kernel Intel OS. Computer history is littered with “Second System” effects, but Google’s “second system” looks promising. We already know what it looks like. The open source Fuchsia project is led by QNX and BeOS veterans, with plenty of experience designing Android. Fuchsia code boots on x86 hardware, and the source tree indicates it’s going to be backwards-compatible with key Android libraries. Fuchsia has been touted as suitable primarily for embedded devices and its key developers have embedded experience. (And Fuchsia wouldn’t need to be running Android libraries if Google only wanted it to power watches and fridge magnets.) Strong ARMed tech You really need to look at demographics and the cost curve of client devices to see where Alphabet wants its Android successor to run. The ARM world is gradually superseding the x86/amd64 world, and PC sales are in a long-term decline. ARM has a huge cost advantage over Intel, and most first-time computer users are using ARM tablets and phones. So the opportunity here for “Andromeda” is to ensure the “next billion” coming on line, particularly in emerging economies, remain plugged into Google services, while expanding the capabilities of Android2 so it can run the next generation of creative and productivity applications. Why not just tweak Android to do that? Remix OS does just that, adding power management and overlapping windows to Android x86. The Android architecture is already unwieldy, with much code moving into the GMS (Google Mobile Services) binary. Android has distanced itself from Dalvik with its ART runtime, but this is still an optimised Dalvik. The really serious performance (and user experience) wins are made by moving away from a byte code architecture completely to a new microkernel. Users won’t get that “optimizing apps” wait after a platform update (that’s a sure sign of an archaic platform). Google will want to keep the Chrome brand and user base, but Chrome users themselves couldn’t really care less what it runs, as a Chromebook is just a dumb terminal for web-based Google services. That part is easy. I’d expect to see Fuchsia make its début today, perhaps by borrowing a few ideas from Continuum, allowing a device to act smarter when it’s plugged into a remote display. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 72 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

In addition to that, the producer managed to implement various security enhancements, improve the BIOS update function by disabling the keyboard and power button during the flash/recovery process, and lower the time it takes to enter recovery menu to 4 seconds. Moreover, BIOS 0054 also resolved the issue where users could still access restricted Setup options, such as Minimum/Maximum Duty Cycle (%) and Primary/Secondary Temperature Sensor, even though User Access Level was set to limited. When it comes to installing the present release, you should know that Intel has provided four downloadable files, which must be used in differentiated situations. Specifically speaking, the .BIO package can update the BIOS through an F7 update method, as well as recover it from an unstable state, while the iflash BIOS Update archive is only able to perform an upgrade from a DOS environment. As for the other two Express BIOS Update executables (one for each bit architecture), these files can help you install version 0054 by simply running them from a Windows 7, 8, 8.1, or 10 OS, and following the instructions. That said, download Intel DN2820FYKH NUC Kit BIOS 0054 for the appropriate product, take into account all aforementioned aspects, and carefully update your NUC.

Unique to SGI, the cluster nodes can later be reconfigured as single-node systems with 1 to 32TB of shared memory (scale up) to run SAP S/4HANA® and other real-time applications. SGI also announced that deployments of the SGI UV 300H as a single-node system provide in total over 800 Terabytes of in-memory computing capacity to organizations running the SAP HANA platform. These announcements reflect SGI's broadening leadership in high-performance data analytics and continuing innovation to achieve greater insight and gain competitive advantage with SAP HANA. SGI UV 300H is now SAP-certified under general availability in a clustered scale-out configuration to run SAP BW on SAP HANA or SAP BW/4HANA, using four to sixteen 8-socket nodes and up to 56 Terabytes of in-memory computing capacity. When business lines wish to move to real-time analytics utilizing SAP Business Suite on SAP HANA, SAP Bank Analyzer, SAP S/4HANA Finance, or other SAP S/4HANA applications, the clustered systems can be fully repurposed to form single-node systems with 4 to 32 sockets. By avoiding the need to "rip and replace" multi-node clusters when single-node systems are required, IT organizations can enjoy considerable cost savings by protecting investments and reduce time to solution. More than 100 single-node SGI UV 300H systems have been installed in organizations worldwide to provide data analytics in real time with SAP HANA and enable business lines to know when, where and how customers are buying without delay; view inventories, supply chains or financials with up-to-the-second accuracy; and spot market changes early and adjust with precision.

Reuters/Chaiwat Subprasom Recently, a 27-inch Apple iMac with 5K Retina Display and seventh generation Intel Kaby Lake processor popped up at Best Buy. The Apple iMac 2016 is expected anytime soon, and this listing on Best Buy made everyone believe it is the new iMac 2016. However, certain discrepancies have cast doubts on the listing. The Apple iMac 2016 listing appeared Sunday night on Best Buy for the 32GB variant also boasting a 2TB Fusion Drive. It claims to have a seventh generation Intel Core i7 processor and AMD Radeon R9 M380 graphics chipset with 2GB of video RAM. The page is offering the product for US$3,199 (AU$4,170 approx). However, experts have found discrepancies with the model number K0SC0LL/A as it does not conform to the existing nomenclature of MK462, MK472, or MK482 prefacing a remaining two digits, and completed with a /A, writes Apple Insider. Moreover, an existing model in the Apple official website also offers a 2TB Fusion Drive, 32GB RAM and a 4.0 GHz sixth generation i7 processor. It carries a price tag $50 less than the one being offered at Best Buy as iMac 2016. Another discrepancy is the AMD Radeon R9 M380 graphics chipset as R9 M395 is already being offered in the existing 5K iMac. It’s also not clear if Kaby Lake quad-core processors compatible with 27-inch Retina 5K iMac is shipping at all. It is possible that the listing is a big mistake by some Best Buy employee or just a placeholder, writes TechnoBuffalo. But whatever it is, the timing seems to be perfect. It proves that Apple is gearing up for the iMac 2016 release and it can be very much in October. The MacBook Pro 2016 is also anticipated this month. Stay tuned on IBT AU for more updates on Apple iMac 2016, Apple MacBook Pro 2016, Apple MacBook Air 2016 and much more. Submit Correction 0 0 0 Related Apple iPad Pro 2017 in spring 2017?

This lineup can be purchased at Lenovo Exclusive stores and multi brand outlets like Croma, Reliance Digital and Ezone. To begin with, there are the Lenovo Ideapad 710s and 510s, both of which are claimed to be high on portability and performance. The latter is host to Harman Kardon speakers and a full HD display. The laptop is supplemented with 8GB RAM and 1TB storage that allows smooth performance while on the move. It can be bought in exchange of Rs 51090. The Ideapad 710s is built on similar lines and sleeker than the previous one. It offers a longer battery life and JBL speakers with Dolby home theater certification. This slim device is designed to be carried easily and costs Rs 73390. Lenovo has made two multimedia-based laptops for those seeking entertainment. The Ideapad 310 has stereo speakers with Dolby Audio Premium that claim to deliver sound in home theater quality. This system combined with specs like Nvidia graphics is meant to appeal to media-heavy consumers. It is available for Rs 28390. The other media-rich notebook is the Ideapad 510 which is the higher-end cousin of the Ideapad 310. The former is provided with Nvidia graphics and a full HD resolution that can be a big bonus when it comes to video editing and playing, as well as gaming. This laptop is being sold for Rs 61690. Lenovo continues to expand its Yoga series with the new Yoga 510. The 360-degree foldable laptop is lightweight and endowed with fast charging technology. Its features are somewhat similar to the Yoga 710. The first will be sold in black and white color variants for Rs 40990 and the latter at Rs 85490. Laptops are not the only thing on Lenovo’s mind this festive season. The Miix 310 detachable hybrid weighs merely 580 grams, is highly portable, and supplemented with performance-based setups like a long battery life, 4G connectivity, and full HD display. It is available on Amazon India at a seasonal offer of Rs 15990 but is otherwise sold at Rs 16827, lower than its official cost of Rs 17490. Also Read: Lenovo Z2 Plus quad core, full HD phone hits Amazon India Gaming enthusiasts have reasons to cheer too. A wide 17.3-inch screen working in tandem with quad core processors and discrete graphics are present on the desktop-class gaming laptop Ideapad Y700. Lenovo is bundling this device with a gaming kit that is being offered for a discounted price of Rs 2999. It includes an armored backpack, special headset, mechanical mouse, and gaming mouse. The notebook will be available at Rs 128090. Lenovo is offering up to 3 years of Accidental Damage Protection and 3 years of additional warranty on select models. The laptops will come bundled with McAfee Live Safe Suite for privacy and protection.

With Hollywood superstar George Clooney as it’s talking head, EP, as it is known, was founded by senior US Intel “spook” Gayle Smith, former Senior Director of the National Security Council under President Obama and now head of the USAID/CIA. Today EP is headed by Ms. Smith’s protégé John Prendergast whose history as head of EP is one of subterfuge and lies in service to Pax Americana. EP claims it’s mission is to prevent genocide in Africa, as in the name “Enough Project”, yet has been conspicuously silent when it comes to the genocidal famine in Somalia during the Great Horn of Africa Drought in 2011-12 where 250,000 Somali children starved to death. Recently George Clooney was enjoying 15 minutes of fame as a humanitarian claiming to have exposed massive corruption in South Sudan when he should have been warning the world of the UN’s next genocide in Somalia as in 300,000 starving children. Soon the genocide in Somalia will hit its peak with hundreds, up to 1,000 children a day dying from hunger with only a deafening silence emanating from the CIA’s Enough Project. EP, with support from its big brother, the Centre for American Progress, only once in its history raised a real genocide, that back  in 2007-8 when Gayle Smith was out to political pasture, she being a rabid democrat during the Bush Jr. years in office. Then she was part of the Democrat “opposition” to the Bush regime and oh so briefly raised the food and medical aid blockade in the Ogaden in Ethiopia, where the only instance of both the Red Cross and Doctors Without Borders being expelled from a famine stricken region has been allowed. Once Ms. Smith jumped on the Obama For President bandwagon, no further objections to the genocide in the Ogaden were heard. Today EP is proving its loyalty to Pax Americana by playing huckster for regime change in South Sudan, as in denying China access to African oil via the invasion of “peacekeepers” in the name of Responsibility To Protect of Libyan infamy. The USA has abandoned former “rebel leader” Riek Machar in favor of direct military intervention in South Sudan by the UN and the USA’s gendarme in Africa, the AU. The Chinese have started to expand their oil production so expect to hear louder cries of outrage from the likes of EP about various crimes and even “genocide” in South Sudan followed by demands for more foreign military intervention in the country. With all their lies and subterfuge don’t you think that we here in Africa have had enough of the CIA’s Enough Project? This article was originally published on Telesurtv.com Thomas C.

The company has developed a portfolio - including star performers Delivery Hero and HelloFresh - that's valued at €6 billion. "The Rocket empire put Berlin on the map, but now more and more rising companies have an independent background, like SoundCloud," Lukas Kampfmann, CMO of Factory Berlin, a startup co-working space, says. This second wave of Berlin startups is not only more independent; it's also more international. ADVERTISEMENT American entrepreneurs Naren Shaam of GoEuro and Suchit Dash of Dubsmash say the ubiquity of the English language in the city combined with its youthful feel and cheap rent was what convinced them to launch their businesses there. "Berlin is now second to London in Europe's startup ecosystem," says Yann de Vries of investment firm Atomico. "US investors are coming more and more, with bigger rounds." Kampfmann agrees: "The signal was the [$19 million] investment by Sequoia in Wunderlist in 2013. Now there's a lot of money coming from international investors." Even though the first quarter of 2016 included the highest number of investments ever (54), the amount of funding - $222 million - fell below that of any quarter in 2015. But Berlin's diverse startup ecosystem remains unpredictable. As recently as the summer of 2015, nobody saw Dubsmash coming. "There's a trend towards hidden champions," says Katja Nettesheim, founder of _MEDIATE. Deep tech and engineering startups keep thriving, echoing Germany's industrial tradition. According to de Vries, what's clear is that Berlin "is at a tipping point". ElektroCouture elektrocouture.com Read more Europe's hottest startups 2016: Istanbul Europe's hottest startups 2016: Istanbul By Liat Clark Schönhauser Allee 180, 10119 Lisa Lang, a former engineer, couldn't find clothes to "express her nerdiness", she says. In 2014, she founded (and fully financed) her own fashion technology house, focusing on light wearables. ElektroCouture sells LED jewellery and clothes that glow in the dark - including a jacket that changes colour based on texts it receives. Lang has produced clothing for Lufthansa, IBM and Intel and sells her collection on ASOS, and, soon, Amazon. Splash splashapp.co Am Festungsgraben 1, 10117 After testing Oculus Rift, Michael Ronen, Stefan Marx and Maximilian Schneider decided to "democratise and socialise" VR. Founded in February 2015 and launched the following June, Splash enables people to send 360° videos using a smartphone's camera and panoramic stitching. The founders claim that Splash soon attracted 30,000 customers in almost 200 countries. ADVERTISEMENT Read more Europe's hottest startups 2016: Barcelona Europe's hottest startups 2016: Barcelona By Liat Clark GoEuro goeuro.com Schönhauser Allee 180, 10119 In 2010, Naren Shaam visited 14 European countries and got frustrated with rail and coach companies not allowing multimodal bookings. "There was no way of knowing what was the fastest or the cheapest way," says Shaam, 33. So, in 2012, he launched GoEuro, a continent-wide service offering all modes of travel. It now covers 32,000 rail and bus stations and 207 airports in 12 European countries. The site, which counts ten million monthly users, has raised $76 million. Kitchen Stories getkitchenstories.com Muskauer Str 43, 10997 ADVERTISEMENT Read more Europe's hottest startups 2016: Tel Aviv Europe's hottest startups 2016: Tel Aviv By Oliver Franklin-Wallis University friends Verena Hubertz and Mengting Gao often organised dinner parties but were disappointed by the quality of cooking apps on the market. So they launched their own, Kitchen Stories, in 2014. Available in 12 languages, it offers original video recipes, step-by-step photo instructions, an integrated timer and auto-generated shopping list. The founders say it has ten million users in 150 countries. Marley Spoon marleyspoon.com Paul-Lincke-Ufer 39-40, 10999 Founded in April 2014 by Fabian Siegel and Till Neatby, Marley Spoon delivers ready-to-cook recipe boxes. The service, which develops ten new recipes per week and claims to use fresher ingredients and produce less waste than supermarkets, has raised $27.5 million in funding since its launch. The startup has delivered food to 2.6 million households in Germany, the UK, the Netherlands, Belgium, Australia and the US.

The company behind them was Dubsmash - launched in November 2014 by Jonas Drupel, Roland Grenke and Daniel Taschik. Its app allows users to record themselves with their favourite song or movie soundtrack, available in Dubsmash's sound bank, and share the video with their friends. The app reached number one in the App Store in 29 European countries and its 100 million users create 35 videos per second. "A lot of the content is very conversational," says Dubsmash president Suchit Dash. To this end, the company recently launched Dubchat, a messaging service on its own platform. "In a few years' time, the main tool to communicate will be the camera," Dash says. It has raised $5.5m in a series A led by Index Ventures.

It claims to have an algorithm that detects fashion trends early and works with factories to produce more than 50,000 low-cost products faster than traditional retailers to customers in Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland and Italy. Blinkist blinkist.com Sonnenallee 223, 12059 Friends Sebastian Klein, Niklas Jansen, Holger Seim and Tobias Balling found it hard to continue learning after leaving university. In 2012, they launched Blinkist, an app that summarises non-fiction books in 15 minute "blinks" that can be consumed in audio or video formats. The startup has raised $6.74 million - including $4.3 million in January 2016 from Greycroft Partners in series A funding. More than 1,500 books in 16 categories are available for the platform's one million users, from corporate culture to parenting. DOJO Madness dojomadness.com Axel-Springer-Str 54b, 10117 ADVERTISEMENT Jens Hilgers and Delivery Hero co-founder Markus Furmann are veterans of the e-sports scene through their investment company Bitkraft. In 2014, the team launched DOJO Madness, for gamers to master their play using machine learning. LOLSUMO, their personal coaching app for League of Legends players, has 70,000 daily users. The company raised $4.5 million in series A funding led by March Capital Partners. Movinga movinga.com Sonnenburger Str 73, 10437 Founded in 2015 by Bastian Knutzen and Chris Maslowski, this online removal company provides relocation for, it claims, 70 per cent less than other companies. The firm - which has raised $31.82m, including $25m from Index Ventures - has moved more than 10,000 households' property in Germany, Austria, France, Italy and Switzerland by licensing third-party vehicles that were not being used.

Pomona lineman Jake Moretti, state’s top recruit, flips commitment from Ohio State to Colorado Broncos’ blocked kick game-winner was a rare perfect storm in the NFL Salida OK’s community of 200 tiny homes to help ease housing crunch Robin Givhan, The Washington Post PARIS —  Exquisitely beaded lanyards, tweed baseball caps, luxe laptop bags —  are these the trinkets that can satisfy the Chanel customer who fancies herself a tech geek as well as a fashion fiend? They were on the runway alongside an array of dresses in blown-up motherboard prints and jackets that seemed to be woven from colored wires and lights. In his work for Chanel, designer Karl Lagerfeld has commented on the wonders of technology before, but for spring 2017, he focused on the innards of our computers —  the data, the algorithms and microchips  —  instead of the gleaming exterior. For some time, fashion has been been trying to sort out its relationship with technology, trying to figure out the ways in which computer chips and sensors tucked into clothes can improve our lives, or at least make them more interesting. But beyond the basics —  fabrics that excel in keeping us cool or warm —  technology and fashion are essentially passing acquaintances. Sometimes uncomfortably so. Indeed, the designer Hussein Chalayan, in a collaboration with Intel, showed a spring collection in which models wore glasses that picked up their breathing and heart rate and transferred that information to their bulky belts. The data was then broadcast onto a screen so that the audience could get a gander at the models’ stress levels as they walked by. Which leads one to wonder: Do you really want to know how stressed you are going into a meeting with your boss? Don’t you already know? Patrick Kovarik, AFP/Getty ImagesA model presents a creation for Chanel during the 2017 Spring/Summer ready-to-wear collection fashion show on October 4, 2016 in Paris.<br />(Photo credit should read PATRICK KOVARIK/AFP/Getty Images) Such technology may, in the future, prove indispensable. Who knew that the ability to photograph every morsel of food you put into your mouth would become so essential to the dining experience? Meanwhile, applaud Chalayan for his intellectual curiosity, ignore Intel’s high-tech fanny packs and just take a look at the clothes, which were quite nice with their easy fit, elongated sleeves and slightly oversize shoulders. If the technology aspect at Chalayan was inelegant science and no art, at Chanel, it was all art. Or at least artful commerce. The experience of a Chanel runway show is, even by fashion standards, extreme. Women —  and men —  fetishize Chanel in a way that fans of other brands do not. They arrive draped in Chanel jackets, skirts, brooches, bags, hats and perfume. Even the singer Usher, who attended Tuesday’s spring 2017 presentation, was costumed in a black Chanel jacket bedecked with braided trim and brooches and with the double-C logo in crystals on the back. There is a look-at-me vibe at Chanel that is particularly striking. This season, a flock of young women wafted into the Grand Palais, each trailed by her own photographer. Accompanying stylists proceeded to fluff and powder them for their close-ups; the other guests were just a bunch of extras on the set.

You do not have to be in the know to know Chanel. Lagerfeld has kept Chanel churning by injecting it with the mood or the story line of the day. (Chanel weathered the recession just fine, but recently profits have dropped.) Tech is currently the story. So Lagerfeld makes that connection. He gives his customers the sense that they are in on the fashion and technology conversation. That they are forward-looking. But he doesn’t let science get in the way of the dresses, the jackets or a few good gewgaws.   Digital & Driveway Delivery - 50% Off blog comments powered by Disqus More in Fashion Photos: Denver Fashion Weekend Fall 2016 at City Hall November 14, 2016, 9:48 am Saturday night saw Denver’s most fashionable both on and off the runway.

That's when Linux creator Linus Torvalds officially released the first Linux kernel into the wild. "As I mentioned a month(?) ago, I'm working on a free version of a minix-lookalike for AT-386 computers," Torvalds wrote in a newsgroup post on Oct. 5, 1991. "It has finally reached the stage where it's even usable (though may not be depending on what you want), and I am willing to put out the sources for wider distribution." Torvalds released version 0.02 of the kernel that day, unleashing what went on to become one of the most transformational forces in computing history. August 25 was when Torvalds sent around an email that kicked off the OS. In the 25 years that have passed since then, Linux has gone on to include some 22 million lines of code. More than 13,500 developers from more than 1,300 companies have contributed to the Linux kernel -- just since the adoption of Git made detailed tracking possible back in 2005. Roughly 7.8 changes are now accepted into the kernel every hour. It gains 4,600 lines of new code every day. Top corporate sponsors include Intel, Red Hat, Samsung, IBM, Google, AMD and ARM. "Linux put open source on the map and began the journey of the rise of open source for serious computing," said Al Hilwa, a program director with IDC. The software has both inspired and experienced major evolution since its debut in 1991, said Charles King, principal analyst with Pund-IT. "By the time the OS began making forays into the commercial market a half decade or so later, it became a catchphrase for advocates hoping to overthrow what they saw as Microsoft's hegemony over desktop computing," King recounted. Meanwhile, the software incited nothing short of a revolution in corporate data centers. "The nascent OS became a power on mainframe platforms, then RISC-based systems," King said. "But a funny thing happened along the way: Linux's hardware agnosticism inspired a range of new Intel/x86-based solutions which, in turn, gradually began to undermine proprietary Unix operating systems." The early battles were fought at the edge of the network but eventually worked their way back to the biggest iron. Today, more than half of the new mainframe workloads IBM sells are Linux-based, he noted. The OS also continues to expand into new burgeoning areas, including mobile and IoT. "Linux may be celebrating its silver anniversary today," King said, "but for many in the IT industry, the 'little OS that definitely could' has been pure gold."

Friday, June 3, 2016 · 3:58 pm · 16 Comments “Do you want more power-efficiency or CPU horsepower with your next PC chip?” Agam Shah reports for IDG News Service. “The merits of each have propelled an interesting debate among those who want more performance or longer battery life in their PCs. But raw CPU performance drives the ongoing rivalry between AMD and Intel.” “Intel wants to continue to deliver 10 to 20 percent performance improvements with chips based on the upcoming 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer manufacturing processes, company CEO Brian Krzanich said this week,” Shah reports. “Some critics may deem those numbers to be incremental, which is why AMD’s upcoming Zen PC chip is getting attention. The chip will deliver 40 percent improvement in instructions-per-cycle, a metric related to CPU performance. Chip makers haven’t historically seen the big performance boost coming in Zen, AMD’s Chief Technology Officer Mark Papermaster has said,” Shah reports. “But Intel has different goals, with a larger focus on increasing battery life in laptops and keeping PCs affordable.” Read more in the full article here. MacDailyNews Take: Different chips for different needs. We look forward to seeing how Intel’s first 10-nm chips (Cannonlake) perform when they are released (scheduled for second half of 2017).

Where’s the 4 Ghz chip at? By now, there should be a 10 Ghz, 20Ghz, 50 Ggz chip. There has been NO INCREASE even up to 4 Ghz !!!! Well then, a computer with slots built in. Chips that have 8 cores, AND THERE OWN SEPERATE memory access. These 8 core chips, and memory, should come 4 on a card (each card has four 8 core chips. And you should have at least four slots per computer ! Anyone heard of the transputer? Both Atari, and Commodore where working on this concept. Of course, they had to deal with the tech they had at the time. BUT the transputer, needs to be given another shot, since there’s NO INCREASE in the speed of these processors. O.K.. there’s some overclocking…… big deal, so what? Rex Friday, June 3, 2016 - 8:44 pm · Reply The laws of physics have to be accounted for. There is a huge cost in power for running a chip fast, and there is an inflection point where pushing much more power only yields minimal speed increases. Intel famously tried the “GHz over everything” idea that you are proposing with the NetBurst architecture. It sucked. They hit high speeds, but the chips didn’t actually have good performance. Further, they drew crazy amounts of power and required huge amounts of cooling to dissipate all that heat. Thankfully, they abandoned that idea starting with the Core series of chips, and we have much more powerful computers as a result, even though the GHz speeds may be much less than what the NetBurst Pentiums had. As for the Transputer stuff… that idea has been replaced with networked computers, blade servers and the like. There is no point in building in the very complicated and expensive extra ports and timing hardware needed to be able to utilize an extra X number of CPUs. Remember that each additional chip you want to add has more than 1,150 pins which means you want computers to have literally tens of thousands of extra traces on the PCBs, all routed by hand, all connected to components, just for the off chance someone might plug in a card some day. That’s a really good idea in theory, but in my opinion, terrible in practice.

It’s best to have multiple lanes of traffic and carpool at slower speeds. lambrettamike Saturday, June 4, 2016 - 1:40 am · Reply What about their own A10 or A11; wouldn’t have to bother with Intel anymore, as they are so yesteryear!! Truth is nobody knows except Apple Inc. They have surprised the market before with the 64 bit mobile SOC, so why not another submarine project that has been working to deliver real desktop class power!! Derek Currie Saturday, June 4, 2016 - 8:23 am · Reply Apparently, I prioritize sharing useful information over having to deal with the blow-back of ignorance. Here I go again: 1) Apple’s A-Series chips are too slow at this point to replace Intel’s latest chips. 2) Apple’s A-Series chips are RISC based CPUs. Intel’s chips are CISC based. That means the apps and OS written for the Intel chips have a massive overhead that is dependent upon CISC based code. None of that code is provided by RISC chips. That makes any transition a massive operation that may be made impossible if Intel refuses to license their proprietary x86 code. – – Clearly this is far too complicated for many minds to comprehend. If that’s the case, then go learn in order to understand. Don’t throw ignorance back at me about this problem, OK? I don’t want to hear your problems. 3) All apps and OS X would have to be REWRITTEN to work with the A-Series chips. That is entirely possible with OS X thanks to the brilliant XNU kernel, which is son-of the flexible Mach kernel. 4) Yes, there could be a translation layer, but go see point #2 above about proprietary Intel x86 code. The translation layer would obviously SLOW DOWN OS X. 5) Apple has NOT built virtualization into their A-Series chips. But ARM has been working on providing virtualization. Again, see #2 above about proprietary Intel X86 code. That’s enough lecturing for today. Lambrettamike Saturday, June 4, 2016 - 10:26 am · Reply DC: it’s not that Apple Computer is a stranger to Massive migratory moves … PowerPC to Intel, migration to OSX UNIX … as for the proprietary Intel X86 code, everything comes at a price or can be encompassed in a deal (i.e. Licensing for X86 code by allowing Intel components into the iPhone/iPad lineup). In other words, never say never with the master of Innovation! Derek Currie Sunday, June 5, 2016 - 7:20 am · Reply Never say never is fair. But this meme is being tossed around flippantly with no consideration of the hardware or software factors involved. If you go over previous threads on the subject here at MDN you’ll find the same. IOW: Consider the facts of the matter, not the mindless meme mongering. Voice of reason Saturday, June 4, 2016 - 11:45 pm · Reply DC, you’re right about a lot of stuff. But I think the comment above yours was describing a “skunk works” type project to produce a chip that could run circles around the Intel chips similar to what apple did with the mobile chipsets. Remember that when they bought PA Semi, they had a PowerPC/RISC variant that was faster than the fastest core chips in development at the time. I don’t see any reason why that team couldn’t have been working on both the mobile designs and desktop designs all these years. As for the overhead issue, if the risc system is fast enough, a second Rosetta could easily mitigate the transition issues. And developers would build universal applications again. Just the exact reverse of the Intel transition. It all comes down to what is in the labs, and who would be able to fabricate the processor. I detailed the other day how I thought t might work: They would all be “A” series chips, but with different power levels, and capabilities: A10/10x mobile (iOS devices, Apple TV, and maybe the MacBook) A10/A10x desktop (13″ MacBook Pro, 21″ iMac, Mac mini) A10/A10x professional (15″ MacBook Pro, 27″ iMac, Mac Pro) This rampant speculation, but I don’t think it’s out of the realm of possibility since Intel is hitting the wall again. And the RISC design does have a lot more benefits, and it wouldn’t surprise me if some type of secret project was in the works. I mean nobody had any clue about the A series processors before the A4 just showed up in the original iPad. Derek Currie Sunday, June 5, 2016 - 7:24 am · Reply If/when Apple and ARM kick Intel’s ass with a faster generation of chips, that will be a lovely day. All the other factors remain. But if I was Apple, that would be a serious project. Meanwhile, as someone pointed out in the thread, the state of technology is such that we have new barriers in chip design to overcome. Moore’s Law is over, for now anyway. There again is an incentive to escape CISC chips, especially Intel’s. Voice of reason Sunday, June 5, 2016 - 7:32 am · Reply Totally right. There’s only so much die shrinking can accomplish. And the cisc design is running into a lot of barriers. It will be a truly happy day when we have risc chips back inside every product. Much more efficient. Mik Wednesday, October 5, 2016 - 1:18 pm · Reply No, not much more efficient. They are CISC and RISC are simply different instruction sets. There is nothing inherently more efficient about one over the other. Just because you’re accustomed to Intel’s past history of designing for performance to meet the needs of desktop customers does not mean that ARM (RISC) is fundamentally more efficient. The a9X in the iPad Pro is roughly equivalent to the Core M processor in the 2015 MacBook, and power usage is about the same as well. But as you well know Apple jumped on a newer chipset for 2016, so the MacBook is once again faster than the 12″ iPad. With as good or better battery life as well. The real story is that ARM/RISC simply doesn’t have as much pro-level high performance software on the market. The way Apple is mismanaging its app stores, ARM/RISC will always be too locked down and too limited to gain software developer support. Apple’s current Macs wisely chose to move to CISC / Intel architecture so it could run the most powerful software on the market. Cook needs to do better to embrace performance computing if it wants to have a slice of the action for native software. As it is, multiplatform users still have to rely on Parallels or Fusion or Bootcamp+Windows or Crossover in order to run the critical Windows programs they rely on. Moving the Mac to run an ARM chip would kill that ability, and kill Mac sales for good. John Dingler, artist Saturday, June 4, 2016 - 1:20 pm · Reply Ha ha ha.

They will come to the stadium venue (often downtown) where they will spend more money, boosting the city’s tax revenues and overall economy. Whether your city gets a direct cut of stadium concessions or just tax revenue, it’s worth exploring how technology can bring in even more. 1. Bring in more cash First, consider wireless technology to let fans order food and drinks from their seats. If fans have to get up out of their seats and stand in line to make purchases, they’ll order less. Eliminate the obstacle and make more sales. Second, wireless, in-seat ordering gives more information about customers and the opportunity to establish an ongoing digital relationship. It allows stadiums to start a rewards program that encourages people to buy more. It’s what successful online retailers do. 2. Focus on the fan experience Another way to make the stadium more successful is to improve the experience so that more fans want to go. There are a few different approaches. IBM uses data and analytics to uncover things that aggravate fans so they can be corrected. In its work at Sun Life Stadium, home of the Miami Dolphins football team, it aggregates data from sensors, turnstiles and other sources, bringing it all into one control room where staff can act to ensure lines are moving smoothly and fans are comfortable. Meanwhile, Ooredoo is already working on a technology pavilion for FIFA World Cup 2022. Its pavilion will showcase a range of intelligent network solutions that will provide fans inside the ground and viewers around the world with up-to-the-moment information and results at sporting events. And Intel has laid out several ways that technology can make stadiums smarter (and more profitable.) Intel has a suite of offerings that help fans find parking spaces and then, once they’re in the stadium, find their way around and even connect with friends who are also at the game. And Intel helps make sure fans are safe. Surveillance cameras can monitor the behavior of the crowd and quickly detect unruly fans. 3. Reduce operational costs Of course, another way to boost your return on investment is to lower your operational costs. Intel’s platform uses sensors and other data to track how many people are at the stadium, automatically adjusting heating and lighting levels to minimize energy use. Sensors can also track how many people have used the restrooms, automatically triggering a work order when a certain threshold has been met. This ensures the restrooms are always clean for fans while also keeping staff at reasonable levels. Stadiums are one of a city’s larger investments and a little technology can help cities get much more from that investment. Kevin Ebi is editor of the Smart Cities Council’s publications. The Council publishes the free Smart Cities Readiness Guide, which provides help and advice for crafting a smart cities vision, plan of action and method of tracking progress. _____________ To get connected and stay up-to-date with similar content from American City & County: Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Watch us on YouTube   Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet 's blog Log In or Register to post comments EMAIL Print Who should pay for microgrids?

TECHNOLOGY Robots Might Take Your Job, but You'll Get a Better One, Says Robot Engineer Dr. Steve Cousins, whose robots now work at 12 hotels in California, says robots will displace humans in certain jobs, but they'll also create more across the economy. By Will Yakowicz Will Yakowicz is an award-winning journalist and a staff writer and podcaster for Inc. magazine. Before Inc., he reported from the West Bank and Moscow for Tablet Magazine; he covered business, crime, and local politics for The Brooklyn Paper; and he was the editor of Park Slope Patch. He lives in Brooklyn, New York. @WillYakowicz Staff writer, Inc.@WillYakowicz WRITE A COMMENT Relay, Savioke's delivery robot, has been adopted by hotels in California. CREDIT: Savioke Advertisement Inside the hotel lobby of Aloft Cupertino, a 3-foot-tall robot sits at a charging station, waiting for a task. Just as a guest calls the front desk for extra towels, the concierge enters the room number onto the robot touchscreen, opens its lid, and places the items inside. Within minutes, the robot, named Relay, arrives at the guest's front door, and then returns for the next task. Relay doesn't work at just Aloft; 12 other California hotels pay a subscription fee for their own robotic butlers--all made by Savioke, the creator and manufacturer. Founded in 2013 by Dr. Steve Cousins, Savioke is has $17.5 million in VC funding from such investors as Intel Capital, Google Ventures, and EDBI (Singapore's investment arm that it betting robots can help the country get through its labor shortage). Soon, another dozen hotels across California will be using Relay. Cousins also hopes to expand into other industries, including hospitals, elder care, and last-mile delivery. Before Savioke, Cousins was tapped by Scott Hassan, to serve as CEO of his robotics research lab, Willow Garage. (Hassan had written the original code for Google's search engine, and made millions from his early stake in the company.) At Willow Garage, Cousins helped create the Robot Operating System (ROS), an open source software that has become the standard system for robots (think Windows, but for robots). He also helped create the PR2, a personal robot platform outfitted with cameras, sensors, arms, and wheels. The rapid rise of advanced technology has caused deep uncertainty about the future of the job market. But many within the field aren't worried. Melonee Wise, founder of Fetch Robotics and Willow Garage alum, says we shouldn't rush to blame the bots. "Your computer doesn't un-employ you, your robot doesn't un-employ you. The companies that have those technologies make the social policies and set those social policies that change the workforce," she said. "[Utilizing robots is] about increasing productivity, not decreasing headcount." Cousins tells Inc. that technology--specifically, automation and robotics--has actually improved our lives. "Some people will be left behind," he says. "But the big picture is that the world doesn't get worse as technology advances, it gets better. Some people will be displaced, but there will be more net jobs." A 2015 study by Deloitte looked at the relationship between jobs and technology by from 1871 to 2011. Labor intensive and dangerous jobs are lost to technology, according to data. At the same time, jobs in nursing and medicine, education, government, knowledge-based industries, and professional services have increased significantly. In total, the study concluded that technology creates more jobs than it destroys. As wage inequality continues to grow in the U.S., where the top 10 percent make 48 percent of the nation's annual income and the top 0.1 makes nearly 9 percent, the gap between rich and poor is vast. Some experts say blaming automation for wage inequality is Luddite-doom-and-gloom propaganda, while others say advancements in technology does play a role. Erik Brynjolfsson, a professor of management at MIT's Sloan School, and co-author Andrew McAfee argue in their book, The Second Machine Age, that technology is the "main driver of the recent increases in inequality." The fact is that fewer people are working. Wages are stagnant or falling. Productivity and profits are higher than ever. According to Five Thirty Eight, U.S. manufacturers are producing more things with fewer employees because of automation. A recent report by Forrester, reveals a bleak future: In five years, robots will eliminate 6 percent of jobs done by humans. "By 2021 a disruptive tidal wave will begin," writes analyst Brian Hopkins in the report. "Solutions powered by AI/cognitive technology will displace jobs, with the biggest impact felt in transportation, logistics, customer service, and consumer services." Cousins admits that there will be some displacement as more robots enter the workforce, but he disagrees with Forrester's theory that net jobs will decrease as robots enter the workforce. "Robots are job creators," he said. But it's the types of jobs that are constantly changing. Thanks to technology, most of us will never have to plow a field. "The nature of work is always changing, and as a society we have to understand that technology is accelerating very fast," said Cousins. While many still remain are nostalgic, Cousins full-heartedly believes technology makes life better while also increasing wealth. As a country, he says, we must focus on improving our education system in a way that helps people learn new skills for an evolving world. "When you change the world, the problem is that the world changes," says Cousins. "Some people are left behind. We need a system in place so when you are left behind you can see what you can do next and how you get to the next step." Victoria Ramirez, who works at the front desk at the Holiday Inn Express in Redwood City, California, says Relay the robot is already part of the team. "He might be a robot to everyone else, but he is a huge help and makes our jobs better," she says. Every morning, Relay takes the elevator to the second floor and parks himself near the breakfast area. As guests walk by, he introduces himself and reminds them to call the front desk if assistance is needed. He returns to the lobby at noon and waits for tasks to be assigned to him. As he kills time, he'll twirl around, open his lid, and tell jokes. When asked if Ramirez is worried that robots will steal her job, she replies," No--not yet, at least."

Christophe Bertrand, vice president of product marketing for Arcserve, says the second generation of the Arcserve Unified Data Protection (UDP) Series appliances takes advantage of faster Intel processors, more memory and solid-state drives (SSDs) to increase the amount of raw source data that can be processed per appliance up to 240TB. “Depending on the type of data, that’s a 2.5 times increase,” says Bertrand. In general, Bertrand says midmarket IT organizations are not only trying to cope with more data, the rise of ransomware has forced IT organizations to rely more on an ability to recover data in a timely manner. Because of that issue, Bertrand says enterprise-class features that make it easier to test actual data recovery fidelity in a data protection offering priced to meet midmarket IT budget requirements is becoming more critical. Other enterprise-class features Arcserve includes with UDP appliances include on-appliance virtual standby, instant failover and bare-metal recovery (BMR), high availability and multi-site WAN-optimized replication across a variety of public and private clouds, says Bertrand. Just as significantly, Bertrand says that because UDP appliances are specifically designed to make use of appliances that, for example, de-duplicate data at its source, the entire data protection process is fundamentally more efficient. Thanks to the rise of ransomware, data protection is clearly a top of mind issue for many IT organizations. The challenge now is figuring out which approaches to data protection make the most sense based not only on where application workloads are deployed, but just as importantly the amount of data that needs to be backed up locally and into the cloud.          |         |     Share Add Comment      Leave a comment on this blog post Please enable Javascript in your browser, before you post the comment!

GamesRadar+ News Reviews Playstation Xbox Nintendo Movies More TV Cool Stuff Magazines Official Xbox Official PlayStation GamesMaster Edge SFX Total Film Search Installing Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare and Modern Warfare Remastered needs 130GB of your HDD By Connor Sheridan Shares Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered are both full-sized games despite being sold together, and they're going to feel like it on your storage device. Images of the box for Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare Remastered Legacy Edition (Modern Warfare Remastered doesn't come with the standard edition) posted by Charlie Intel indicate that the total install size will be a beefy 130 GB on PS4. That's the French version, so the sizes might vary slightly for different regions. We haven't seen the install size for Xbox One yet - it could be a bit different, since Microsoft's console is more flexible about installing multiple unique games from a single disc. Hopefully Legacy edition owners have the option to just install one or the other, since 130 GB is more than a quarter of the size of the common 500GB hard drive. That's a whole lot of Duty. Storage concerns aside, PS4 players can start working through the spruced-up Modern Warfare campaign right now if they pre-order the game. Here's how to play Call of Duty: Modern Warfare remastered early. Seen something newsworthy? Tell us!

Hands-On with the CHUWI Vi10 Plus Running Remix OS 2.0 GO We tried one of the most affordable Remix tablets available Oct 5, 2016 13:01 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  CHUWI is one of the Chinese companies that are trying to compete with foreign manufacturers by offering good value for the money, trying to put the emphasis on quality without a substantial impact on pricing. The Vi10 Plus “tablet PC,” as the company itself calls it, is one of the devices that are part of a product category which Microsoft invented with the Surface RT in 2012. It’s a tablet that can double as a laptop with the help of a detachable keyboard, so it’s aiming to provide a high level of productivity even on the go. At first glance, the Vi10 Plus is quite an interesting product, and when hearing that is running Remix OS, it instantly catches the attention of many buyers. Remix OS is an Android-based operating system that’s supposed to provide you with a PC-like experience, offering a number of advantages that we’ll detail below. The CHUWI Vi10 Plus can be yours online for $129.99 at Gearbest, but the standard version comes without a keyboard - and you’ll definitely need one if you want to enjoy the best Remix OS has to offer. You can also use keyboards from other CHUWI 2-in-1 devices, but depending on their size, the laptop-wannabe might look quite odd. Of course, given the tablet side of Remix OS, you can safely use it as a tablet too, but a keyboard is also recommended if you want to unleash its full potential. Read on to find out what this 2-in-1 device can do given this combination of hardware and Remix OS. Hardware and performance As far as specs are concerned, the CHUWI Vi10 Plus is quite impressive, especially given its price. You can’t get better value for this price and this makes the Vi10 Plus worth a look if you’re in the market for a tablet. First and foremost, it comes with an Intel Cherry Trail Z8300 quad-core processor clocked at 1.44 GHz and paired with 2 GB of RAM. If you’ve read other reviews of devices coming with this CPU, you probably know that we’ve complained about the performance of the chip in Windows 10, especially when multitasking. CHUWI Vi10 Plus with Remix OS back view The Z8300 is a chip specifically aimed at low-cost devices and you can easily notice this in Windows 10. But since it’s Remix OS we’re talking about here, everything seems to be running smoothly with no hiccups. Apps are loaded quite fast and multitasking is significantly improved, especially because Remix creators spent a lot of time to optimize this particular feature. We haven’t noticed any dramatic slowdown for regular use, although some improvements are needed when playing high-definition videos, where loading times are way too long. “Excellent value for the money.” The 10.8-inch IPS display isn’t the best you’ve seen, but thanks to the 1920x1280 pixel resolution, it serves its purpose quite well. There’s a problem with full HD videos given its resolution, but you should get past this very fast. In terms of storage, the Vi10 Plus features 32 GB internally, but TF card support is also available, just in case you want to boost capacity to 128 GB. There are also ports for USB Type C, microUSB, microHDMI, headphones, and a dock at the bottom of the device to connect the keyboard. The device comes with two different cameras, both of them of 2-megapixel capacity, but their performance is only average - which is just fine because you’re not supposed to use the tablet for taking pics anyway. Other than that, you get the regular feature package, including Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. An 8400 mAh battery is there to provide at least 4 hours of continuous video playback, and while this is quite impressive, charging is a nightmare and takes more than 2 hours with the included charger. The tablet is quite light at 600 grams, but remember that a keyboard is also used separately should you want to unleash the full potential of Remix OS. Overall, the CHUWI Vi10 Plus is quite a good choice for typical activities such as browsing the web, working on a document, or sending emails. You can also watch videos and listen to music, but anything beyond that would require better hardware (plus another operating system). CHUWI Vi10 Plus with Remix OS ports Remix OS Remix OS is an Android-based operating system that’s supposed to boost the productivity side of Google’s software with features that you usually find on a PC. And given this thing, a keyboard is absolutely needed should you want to use Remix OS for being productive on the go, so make sure you order one if you plan to buy the tablet. Basically, Remix OS comes with the same features as Android Marshmallow, so you can install apps from the Google Play Store, such as Chrome, Office suits, multimedia players and everything else. In addition, however, it also features PC-like functionality, including a titlebar that lets you close windows easily when working with a mouse, but also resizable windows to work just like on a PC. “PC-like experience on an Android device.” The multiple window and multitasking support is super convenient on an Android device, and although some tweaks are still needed here and there, you won’t believe how easy to use Remix OS actually is. There’s also a taskbar if you want to pin your favorite apps for quick access, and so are several essential apps, such as a file manager and screen capture tool. The basic applications that we all need are there from the very beginning, but we still found ourselves searching the store for new tools to boost productivity. Fortunately, the Google Play Store comes with so many apps that it’s impossible not to find something you need - and this is why Google is probably considering Andromeda anyway. Another good thing about Remix OS is that it receives updates regularly and these include new features and optimizations that make it better and faster. We haven’t found any major drawback with Remix OS and we must admit that we were impressed with how easy to use it makes an Android device. It’s almost like it’s a fully-featured PC. CHUWI Vi10 Plus with Remix OS launcher The bottom line There is no doubt that the CHUWI Vi10 Plus provides good value for the money, and one can easily see this by simply having a look at the spec sheet. But in reality, it’s Remix OS the one that makes it quite special, as it becomes a full productivity device in a second when attaching a keyboard. What’s very important to know is that a keyboard is absolutely needed, and without it, the Vi10 Plus is just another Android tablet. But when connecting a keyboard, you can truly use it as a laptop, and with the rich app support available on Android, there are big chances that you’re going to get job done quite easily. If you’re used to working in Windows, it shouldn’t take too much to discover how good Remix OS is, while Android fans should have absolutely no problem in making the most of the OS as well. As far as the tablet itself is concerned, you won’t get anything better than that for a little bit over $100. Although the specs aren’t exactly next-gen, the hardware is good enough to get the majority of things done, including here watching videos, browsing the web, or working with a document or two. The battery lasts long enough to watch more than 10 episodes of Seinfeld, but the recharging process is painfully slow. If there’s something that needs to be improved, it’s the quality of the keyboard, which is available separately, but once again, you really can’t ask for more when all you have to pay is $100.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (14 Images) #CHUWI#Remix OS#CHUWI Vi10 Plus#tablet review#2-in-1 review subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it CHUWI Vi10 Plus (14 Images) 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Huawei Honor (MediaPad) X2 Review CHUWI HiBook (Windows 10 and Android) 2-in-1 Review Onda Air V919 Tablet with Windows 10 Review Xiaomi Mi Pad 2 Review - A Tribute to iPad Mini Google Suspends Lots of Pixel Buyers Accounts for Reselling Them - Update Hacker Breaks into Italian Government Website, 45,000 Users Exposed Three UK Hacked, Details of 6 Million Customers at Risk Microsoft Replaces Command Prompt with PowerShell in Latest Windows 10 Build Nokia's Return to Smartphone Business Confirmed for 2017 HTC 10 Evo to Be Announced on November 22 Blue Coral Galaxy S7 edge Goes on Sale at Sprint and Verizon Google Suspends Lots of Pixel Buyers Accounts for Reselling Them - Update 14 photos    CHUWI Vi10 Plus with Remix OS New Apps Gus Tools: Turn ESD images of Windows 10 to ISO format, so that you may upgrade your computer to this operating system using a USB or a DVD Avira System SpeedUp: Clean junk files, repair registry errors, delete invalid keys, clean computer activity traces, and defragment your drives using this all-in-one tool POPcon PRO: Advanced program that helps you retrieve messages from POP3 mailboxes and deliver them to your Microsoft Exchange Server mailboxes using antispam, archive, antivirus engine, rule-based distribution and scheduled tasks WFilter Enterprise: Monitor bandwidth, filter and block Internet activities on your network from a single computer via a web-based administration interface PDF to Image Converter: An intuitive and user-friendly application that can come in handy whenever you want to convert your PDF files to various graphic formats Mkgmap splitter: Split the OpenStreetMap files into smaller tiles in order to use them on your Garmin device, with this practical command-line utility Mkgmap: Convert OpenStreetMap tags to a map in IMG format, compatible with Garmin GPS devices, using this advanced command-line application Reader comments Fitbit Blaze Review - Jack of All Trades, Master of One more on: Fitbit i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Over SMB of NFS heb je deze issues niet. Persoonlijk doe ik bij het toevoegen van nieuwe media ook altijd een library update én cleanup zodat niet meer bestaande entries worden weg gehaald. +1 TRaSH @rbr320 • 5 oktober 2016 15:21 Hier ook zo, En dan ism een MySQL library. Werkt probleemloos. De meeste mensen die problemen hebben gebruiken vaak afwijkende manieren of draaien liever in file modus of werkt niet precies zoals hun of een kleine groep mensen het willen. +1 FreshMaker @Terrestrial • 5 oktober 2016 13:40 With him Ik heb voor mijzelf en wat kennissen films in een cyberlocker staan. Afspelen gaat prima, maar her-inlezen van files en veranderingen ( EN film naar NL versie ) geeft nog steeds problemen. Voor het 'gemak' heb ik nu zelfs de oude map helemaal verwijderd, en een nieuwe aangemaakt online. +1 rodie83 @FreshMaker • 5 oktober 2016 15:15 Ooit de addon WatchDog geprobeerd? Die zou aanpassingen in je mediasources automatisch moeten detecteren en de library aan de hand daarvan moeten updaten/cleanen. Bij mij werkt dat perfect, maar mijn mediasources staan wel allemaal lokaal. +1 Cajus @FreshMaker • 5 oktober 2016 13:47 Is dan een Plex server niet een beter alternatief voor dit scenario? +1 FreshMaker @Cajus • 5 oktober 2016 13:55 Als Plex van een owncloud shared folder kan afspelen, en op een RPi kan werken, dan is dat zeker een alternatief. +1 SED @FreshMaker • 5 oktober 2016 14:10 http://www.rasplex.com/ Plex voor Raspb En je owncloud is nogal afhankelijk.. zie bijv dit: https://forum.owncloud.org/viewtopic.php?t=18420 https://www.reddit.com/r/...3b100u/plex_and_owncloud/ +1 FreshMaker @SED • 5 oktober 2016 14:17 Die had ik ook wel gezien ja, en het idee erachter klinkt goed. Maar mijn 'probleem' is dat er een server ( plexserver ) tussen moet zitten, die bereikbaar moet zijn. Ik heb die bestanden juist online staan om zonder tussenkomst of afwezigheid van een mediaserver aan te kunnen bieden. Door ze online te hebben hoeft er bij mij geen apparaat aan te staan, en ben ik niet afhankelijk van de lage uploadsnelheden. +1 SED @FreshMaker • 5 oktober 2016 14:49 Ik begrijp hieruit dat je geen eigen owncloud draait, maar kennelijk meelift bij iemand anders. (owncloud enterprise misschien?) +1 FreshMaker @SED • 5 oktober 2016 15:19 Ik gebruik Stack, van TransIP. Dus een hosted versie +1 thommy86 @FreshMaker • 5 oktober 2016 14:08 Als je Plex server op dezelfde machine hebt staan als de Owncloud folder, dan moet dit vrij simpel kunnen. Op een Pi kan je eventueel Rasplex draaien of een Kodi met PlexKodiConnect. 0 rootrulez @FreshMaker • 5 oktober 2016 14:08 En dat gaat prima. -1 Terrestrial @Cajus • 5 oktober 2016 14:25 +1 Neko Koneko @Terrestrial • 5 oktober 2016 17:14 ja maar ze moeten gewoon zorgen dat het out of the box goed werkt.Of jij moet je realiseren dat het een gratis product is waarvoor je geen cent hoeft te betalen, waardoor jij dus ook geen recht van klagen hebt als het niet 100% werkt met een niet algemeen gebruikte oplossing die jij gebruikt voor het delen van bestanden. Straks ga je ook nog klagen omdat het niet werkt op een oude server met SUN Solaris die je toevallig nog had liggen. +1 Klojum @Terrestrial • 5 oktober 2016 14:17 Als de Estuary-skin een probleem is, kun je altijd nog de Confluence-skin installeren. +1 Senaxx @Terrestrial • 5 oktober 2016 14:35 Ik ben het met je eens. Basis functionaliteit als het bijvoorbeeld verbergen van bekeken posters op je main scherm mist dan ook. En ik heb ook vaak genoeg dat bijvoorbeeld bij mijn ouders of zusje dat even de NAS niet beschikbaar is, en vervolgens leuk bij opruimen de hele bibliotheek leeg gegooid word, of wat je zegt dat alles er dubbel in staat. +1 Ortep @Terrestrial • 5 oktober 2016 14:25 Ik houd me hart vast als we straks naar deze versie moeten met deze nieuwe skin of interface die veel meer de nadruk legt op de bibliotheek modus die nog steeds voor geen meter werkt zolang die naar statische paden blijft kijken.Je hoeft natuurlijk helemaal niet over. Als het werkt dan werkt het. Waarom zou je naar een andere versie gaan als die voor jou niet werkt +1 zeroday @Ortep • 5 oktober 2016 14:49 Ik heb 2x een RPi3 met een mysql db die deze 2 voorziet van de info. dat werkt zonder problemen .. ik blijf er nu met mijn vingers vanaf want als ik iets upgrade dan gaat het geheid mis ;-) Ik wil wel over wanneer ik betaalbare hardware heb die H.265 aan kan .. want dan maakt het niet meer uit wat ik download, dan speelt ie zowat alles -1 Terrestrial @Ortep • 5 oktober 2016 15:40 +1 Ortep @Terrestrial • 5 oktober 2016 16:13 Dat is natuurlijk niet waar want je moet hoe dan ook mee als je wilt dat je plugins blijven werken.Welke plugins werken dan niet meer? De meeste zijn prima backwards compatible. En ook bij de plugins geldt: Je hoeft ze niet te veranderen. Als ze vandaag werken werken ze morgen ook als ze geïnstalleerd zijn. Als jij je oude systeem laat draaien met een oude versie van Kodi met de daarin geïnstalleerde plugins verandert er helemaal niets Maar accepteer nou gewoon dat er een groot probleem is wat opgelost dient te worden.Waarom _moet_ ik_ dat accepteren? Ik heb geen enkel probleem. Voor mij hoeven ze niets op te lossen Jij hebt blijkbaar een probleem. Puur omdat je mensen via een ietwat aparte manier toegang geeft. Dat zal voor 98.9% van de mensen geen enkele rol spelen. Daar zal een developer dan ook weinig aandacht aan besteden. Als ze via NFS of samba gaan is er geen enkel probleem. [Reactie gewijzigd door Ortep op 5 oktober 2016 16:14] -1 Terrestrial @Ortep • 5 oktober 2016 17:51 0 Arrogant @Terrestrial • 5 oktober 2016 18:26 Ik zou aangifte doen tegen degene die jou dwingt Kodi te gebruiken. 0 RolfLobker @Terrestrial • 5 oktober 2016 18:28 Ik vind je houding vrij opmerkelijk Terrestrial. Niemand is jou iets verschuldigd. Staat het je niet aan dan gebruik je het toch lekker niet? Wat jij als "probleem" beschrijft is blijkbaar niet echt een probleem anders hadden de (vrije) ontwikkelaars van Kodi al lang een oplossing bedacht. Het staat je vrij het ontwikkelteam te helpen overigens. Ik zou zeggen; implementeer de code en vraag een commit aan. Ik heb recent al mijn media meermaals verplaatst (2x naar een andere NAS) en had helemaal geen probleem. Kostte me nog geen twee minuten om alle paden van de bibliotheek te wijzigen en doordat ik een centrale MariaDB gebruik werkten beide Kodi-installatie (woon- en slaapkamer) doodleuk verder of er niets veranderd was. Om je maar voor te zijn (want hierboven denk je ons ook uit te moeten leggen wat jij bedoeld met SMB paden); het betreft in mijn geval 13TB aan media. Dus het gaat niet om slechts een paar bestanden. [Reactie gewijzigd door RolfLobker op 5 oktober 2016 18:30] 0 Klojum @Terrestrial • 6 oktober 2016 15:19 "En dat domme gelul dat het een gratis opensource product betreft neem ik absoluut geen genoegen mee, ook daar verwacht ik dat het goed werkt." Stoere taal, hoor. Dit klinkt voor mij niet als een verwachten, maar als stomweg eisen. Ik vind het sowieso een behoorlijk Nederlandse gave om te kankeren tegen zaken die zelfs gratis beschikbaar gesteld worden. Er bestaat zoiets als feature requests waarbij jij je wensen en grieven kunt aangeven op Kodi's bug tracker en/of Kodi's forum. Kritiek in opbouwende vorm wordt daarbij ook een stuk beter verteerd. Als je het zelf beter kan, laat het dan maar zien ook. Enerzijds bestaat de core van Kodi al sinds de Xbox-dagen. De database-opzet dateert ook uit die tijd. Als je de database van een programma overhoop gaat gooien moet ook het daarop gebaseerde programma aanpassen. Dan kun je net zo goed van begin af aan beginnen, en dat is tegelijkertijd het grote probleem. Dat de database-opzet nu niet optimaal is, dat klopt wel. Maar de opzet is destijds gemaakt met de kennis van die tijd. Een stoomcursus via 'MySQL voor Dummies' had al een hoop geholpen, maar die bestond toen nog niet, dus dat is niet gebeurd. Tegelijkertijd, wees blij dat MySQL nog steeds bruikbaar is in Kodi, want er waren al plannen om het te dumpen ten faveure van UPnP. Ik denk zelf dat er een flink aantal gebruikers flink boos zouden worden als dat doorgedrukt zou/zal(?) worden. En ja, Kodi blinkt niet overal uit in gebruikersvriendelijkheid. Het is ontworpen door nerds en dat blijkt ook uit het samenspel van de instellingen in de Kodi GUI en de schier talloze instellingen die via het advancedsettings.xml-bestand zijn aan te passen. Kodi is duidelijk uit z'n jasje gegroeid. Niemand/niets is perfect. Daarbij is het lastig om de kliek van developers aan te vullen met programmeurs die voldoende kennis, tijd en inzet hebben om de boel op Kodi-databasegebied te verbeteren. Het is nog altijd een hobbyclub, geen commercieel bedrijf. Enne, plezier in een hobby kan ook overgaan, hoor. Zijn het niet de wereldwijde beschuldigingen van het aanzetten tot illegaal downloadgedrag, dan zijn het wel jouw hooghartige eisen. Gelukkig kan niet elke Kodi/LibreELEC-collega jouw teksten lezen. +1 z1rconium @Terrestrial • 5 oktober 2016 21:26 Ze hebben er een wikipage voor: http://kodi.wiki/view/HOW...databases_when_files_move -1 Terrestrial @z1rconium • 5 oktober 2016 22:41 +1 musback 5 oktober 2016 13:29 Heb m sinds kort als UWP app geïnstalleerd op low-performance Nvidia ION/intel Atom HTPC'tje, merk toch wel dat performance wat achteruit gegaan is (hier en daar wat haperig beeld bij FHD video) terwijl standaard windows movie app het wel prima doet.

Zeta Storage Systems has compared the two access methods and found... not a lot of difference at all. Zeta’s Lee Chisnall, its CNO (Chief Nobody Officer – think storage product management and marketing) says: “I think that is what sysadmins really want to know: how many IOPS do I lose by running the NVMe devices over a network?” The test rig had two Supermicro-based Xeon CPU E5-1620 v4 @ 3.5GHz systems with 16GB of RAM – one used as an initiator and the other as a target. The NVMe drive was an Intel DC P3700 / 400GB / PCIe card. One test was run over 40Gbit Ethernet using a Mellanox ConnectX-3 Pro MCX314A-BCCT card on both initiator and target, and a second with InfiniBand using Mellanox’s ConnectX-3 MCX354A-FCBT adapter, again at both ends of the link. The two Supermicros ran Linux with a 4.8-rc8 kernel and the FIO test involved Version 2.13, runtime 2, 1-4 workers, 32 queue depth, run 20 times and then averaged. The testing involved running NVMe natively over RDMA network with no iSER or SCSI at all. The initiator sees the NVMe device as the same as a local NVMe and not a SCSI LUN: Chart comparing direct NVMe drive access and NVMe over Fabrics access Local random read drive access with 1KB blocks is faster than the RDMA over either InfiniBand or Ethernet, but the difference was less with 4K blocks, almost vanished with 16K blocks and was virtually non-existent with 64K blocks. The random write situation was different with some local drive superiority with 4K blocks and virtually none with 1K, 16K and 64K blocks. Also writing 4K blocks was faster than writing 1K ones. Chiswell points out: With a single worker at 1K blocksize, random read performance is around 75 per cent of native With a single worker at 64K blocksize, random read performance is around 93 per cent of native With 4 workers, random read performance is near native – around 99.4 per cent Ethernet is basically matching InfiniBand once you look at the total overall performance from all tests He says: “The Ethernet performance really surprised me. I was not expecting it to match InfiniBand.” Also: “While there is more bandwidth in the InfiniBand adapter we used (54.3 vs 40), the NVMe device is not capable of getting anywhere near that level of performance, so the Ethernet bandwidth is not an issue in this test. It would be in a test which features higher performing NVMe.” Here is the full table with both IOPS and MB/sec listed, and 1 and 2 users active: Chiswell tells us: “I believe we are the first vendor with a software-defined storage product (that runs on commodity hardware) that will have support for an NVMeF target. We have it working internally with a release scheduled at the end of October. It will be a standard feature in our Zetavault product with management in the web GUI. “We already have support for NVMe where you can create volumes from an NVMe device(s) and export them as SCSI LUNs over iSCSI, iSER, SRP and FCP. NVMeF will be an alternative way to export the NVMe storage to initiators.” He believes that “NVMeF will be a commodity technology, without the need to buy expensive boxes. Just run it on Dell/HP/Lenovo/Supermicro boxes.” ® Sponsored: Transforming software delivery with DevOps Tips and corrections 7 Comments More from The Register Apeiron claims NVMe fabric speed without NVMe over fabrics - but how?

Hundreds from across the nation will gather in Washington, DC for the two day summit representing government, education and industry. Participants will focus on expanding mentoring opportunities to support women and girls in STEM education and STEM careers. Washington, DC (PRWEB) October 05, 2016 The second annual Million Women Mentors Summit & Gala, held in Washington, DC on October 4 and 5, 2016, brings together leaders with the shared goal of attracting and retaining more women in the STEM workforce through high quality mentorships. Representatives come from industry, higher education, government and nonprofit organizations from around the country for the two day workshop. Since launching less than three years ago, the movement has accumulated nearly 850,000 pledges to mentor women and girls, of which 400,000 are complete and the movement has committed to securing 1,000,000 pledges by the end of 2016. The two-day event brings together 37 state delegations, many led by Governors and Lieutenant Governors. Currently, 17 Lieutenant Governors serve as chairs of their respective delegations and four will be attending from Alabama, Arkansas, Maryland and New Jersey. Million Women Mentors (MWM) aims to increase female participation in the STEM workforce by providing a national platform to engage industry, government and implementation partners. It seeks to tap into the tremendous human capital potential of our nation’s employers to excite, inspire and recruit the next generation of STEM professionals. This Summit provides a unique opportunity for partners and sponsors from around the country to share insights into what is working and seek answers to shared challenges. National nonprofit partners participating in the Summit include FIRST, MIND Research Institute and Girls Inc. Leading sponsor corporations will also send delegations including Tata Consultancy Services, BP, Walmart, PepsiCo and Intel. Greta Van Susteren will keynote the Summit Luncheon and Megan Murphy, Washington Bureau Chief and Executive Editor at Bloomberg News, will keynote and emcee the Million Women Mentors Gala. This year’s Summit takes place at Washington’s historic Omni Shoreham Hotel where hundreds of participants will celebrate accomplishments and focus on solving shared challenges. Key Summit Highlights include: New Online Portal – A new, mobile-friendly Million Women Mentors web portal created by Tata Consultancy Services supports mentors and mentoring programs with new features such as the ability to log the progress of working with mentees and sharing documents and resources among communities of mentors, companies and/or girl-serving organizations. MWM Awards – The Summit concludes with a Gala on the evening of October 5th where 6 awards will recognize excellence over the last year in supporting Million Women Mentors. Award recipients include: State of Tennessee, MIND Research Institute, Science Olympiad, Cognosante, Omega Travel, University of California – Davis and Walmart. Women’s Quick Facts – The release of a highly anticipated compilation of compelling data facts about women in today's society. The publication will be launched during the Summit luncheon. As a founding sponsor of Million Women Mentors, Tata Consultancy Services has been a leader in the MWM movement by completing 32,467 mentorships – over twice its initial pledge of 15,000 – and through the design of both the original and redesigned web platforms. "With over 119,000 women in our own workforce we are a proud founding partner of Million Women Mentors, and deeply cherish the results that this movement has achieved over the past three years. I strongly believe that income equality is the foundation for gender equality & social equity. By bringing together the combined power of purpose, people and technology, we are removing barriers for women in STEM education and careers, helping them realize their full potential. We are proud to support this initiative through mentoring and by providing the technology to enable impactful mentorships in STEM fields." – Balaji Ganapathy, Head of Workforce Effectiveness, Tata Consultancy Services and Vice Chair, MWM Leadership Council. As the recipient of the Corporate Excellence Award, Walmart Corporation joins a group of leaders who are making an impact across the nation. MWM Awards recognize excellence in reaching new groups of women and girls over the past year. “At Walmart, empowering women in STEM is a key to our success. We’re proud to do this work with Million Women Mentors and honored to receive this award,” said Walmart’s President and CEO Doug McMillon. The release of the Women’s Quick Facts book creates for the first time a “one-stop shop” for critical data points about women in today's workplace. “The worldwide release of the Women’s Quick Facts is a must have resource and is mission critical to drive targeted enterprise growth enabled to broaden deeper female diversity among the STEM Talent pipeline and STEM workforce,” affirms Heidi Kleinbach-Sauter, SVP, Global R&D, PepsiCo.

Eurogamer.net Follow @eurogamer Home News PC PlayStation 4 Xbox One Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare + Modern Warfare Remastered = 130GB - minimum Get deleting. By Wesley Yin-Poole Published 05/10/2016 If you install both Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare plus Modern Warfare Remastered, you need at least 130GB of space free on your hard-drive. That's according to the back of the PlayStation 4 version of the Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare Legacy Edition, which itself was revealed by a French retailer (thanks, Charlie Intel). NEWS: Back of Infinite Warfare Legacy Edition box revealed, says 130 GB space required https://t.co/Tdex3cPSY4 pic.twitter.com/wDl5NETeFk— charlieINTEL.com (@charlieINTEL) October 4, 2016 Now, it comes as no surprise to learn that the two games' combined installation size is larger than a single Call of Duty, but 130GB total is something of an eyebrow-raiser. That's over a quarter of your 500GB console hard-drive. We don't know the exact breakdown because Activision has yet to confirm it, but we can suggest that 40GB is for Modern Warfare Remastered, as that's the size of the MWR Campaign Early Access currently available to download on PS4. That leaves a whopping 90GB for Infinite Warfare. Perhaps the size is the result of support for the 4K-fuelled PlayStation 4 Pro? We've asked Activision for clarification. Meanwhile, it's worth noting that if you have downloaded the 40GB Modern Warfare Remastered Campaign Early Access to your PS4, come launch day, you'll have to download the game again. Per the FAQ on Activision's website: The early access period will end on November 3rd. On launch day, you must install the full version of Modern Warfare Remastered that is included with the Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare Legacy Edition, Legacy Pro Edition, Digital Legacy Edition or Digital Deluxe Edition. So, let's say you're downloading the whole lot - that is, Modern Warfare Remastered Campaign Early Access, then Infinite Warfare and Modern Warfare Remastered on 3rd November. You've got 40GB now, then potentially 130GB on launch day. Ouch. Oh, and let's not forget, if you go physical, you need to have the Infinite Warfare disc inserted in your console to play Modern Warfare Remastered. Our digital future!

The OFC standard is supported by about 200 members, spanning consumer, enterprise, industrial, automotive and health industries. Examples of OFC members include Arris, CableLabs, Cisco Systems, Samsung, Microsoft, Qualcomm, Intel, Comcast, HP, and IBM.   RELATED: CableLabs Rebrands Security Spin-Off   IoT testing expands on Kyrio’s areas of business. Kyrio is also developing a WiFi roaming hub/interconnection service (subscription required) for cable operators and partners outside the cable industry, though the initial focus is on independent MSOs, with Midco being the first announced partner for the program.   Kyrio’s flagship business is a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) service, used by MSOs, device makers and trade associations such as the Wi-Fi Alliance. In addition to performance-testing services, which include the new IoT focus, Kyrio also runs Go2Broadband, an offering that started out as a service locator for cable-modem service, but has since evolved into a cloud-based platform that connects resellers and partners such as Best Buy to cable operator services, and as a resource for consumers who move residences and need to switch providers.   “As the Open Connectivity Foundation continues its efforts spearheading IoT standards, we are delighted to work with the world’s top testing laboratories to offer IoT certification testing for our members,” said Michael Richmond, executive director of the Open Connectivity Foundation, in a statement. The addition of Kyrio as an authorized test lab will ensure that we meet the demand for OCF certification testing, helping technology companies and developers achieve complete interoperability across their devices.”   “Our experience helping manufacturers achieve certifications, test interoperability across vendor solutions, and quickly bring new products and technologies to market uniquely positions Kyrio in the marketplace,” added Mitch Ashley, president and GM of Kyrio. “Working with OCF enables us to continue delivering on our commitment to innovation to tackle tough device interoperability challenges and deliver the best end user IoT experience.”   Want to read more stories like this?

Brian Nguyen Sacramento Bee i By the Editorial Board Many years ago, 27 or so, before the Hyatt and Sheraton and Citizen, a San Franciscan had occasion to stay in a downtown Sacramento hotel and noticed creepy six-legged guests in his room. Apologetic hotel staff gave the guest another room, and, when he checked out in the morning, sheepishly handed him the bill, with the price reduced due to what they labeled a “cockroach discount.” The guest did what any self-respecting San Franciscan would do: He told the ultimate arbiter of right and wrong, the late great San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen, who happily turned it into an item, further cementing The City’s dim view of its sad and distant cousin up Interstate 80. Barry Broome, the Sacramento region’s chief economic development recruiter, has his work cut out. But ever the salesman, Broome has a vision and a pitch, and that’s important for a city that is, as Bay Area snobs are wont to say, halfway between San Francisco and Lake Tahoe. Broome and Mayor-elect Darrell Steinberg told The Sacramento Bee editorial board Tuesday that they have embarked on a mission to snag not necessarily Google, Apple, Tesla, Intel, Facebook or other blue-chip corporate headquarters, but jobs that they and smaller companies on the rise might send off-shore or to lower-cost regions in the country. Some 119,000 local residents commute each day to the Bay Area, and 89,000 Bay Area residents come to Sacramento. In some ways, the merger has already begun. Broome’s counterpart, Jim Wunderman of the Bay Area Council, appears to be on the same page, telling an editorial board member that he supports boosting the concept of a mega-region that includes Sacramento. Wunderman and Steinberg will appear on a panel Wednesday at an incubator on Market Street in San Francisco. They don’t have specific goals; as this project evolves, Broome and Steinberg should set a target for net job and payroll gains, preferably for the benefit of people in need who currently live in the region. Without specific goals, no one will be able to gauge success. No one expects Sacramento to supplant Silicon Valley, and it never will be San Francisco. But Sacramento has much to offer. Broome touts the Sacramento region’s universities, its educated workforce, the ports of Stockton and West Sacramento, and its proximity to the gold that can be mined from the San Francisco area. Sand Hill Road, the Wall Street of venture capital, is a short drive from Sacramento, traffic permitting. Sacramento land and housing prices are higher than, say, Indianapolis, but they’re lower than anything in San Francisco, on the Peninsula, or in much of the East Bay. In some ways, the merger has begun. Who knew that 119,000 Sacramento-area residents commute each day to the Bay Area, and that 89,000 Bay Area residents come to Sacramento? That’s 21 percent of the workforce. Therein lies one of the rubs. How to get the 90 miles from downtown Sacramento to downtown San Francisco? The drive takes two hours, or more in rush hour – or, more accurately, rush hours, because jams and bottlenecks go on all day. Seamless rail service is one answer. Steinberg, the former state Senate leader, vowed to focus on extracting funds from the Capitol as soon as he takes office. The hope, he and others say, is to push rail commute times from San Francisco to Sacramento down to 90 minutes, preferably 60. It couldn’t happen soon enough. Caen, the Sacamenna Kid who defined all that was proper in San Francisco in his day, still would need some convincing. But Steinberg and Broome made their pitch as Paul McCartney was preparing to christen Golden 1 Center. Sacramento does have more going for it now than it did when a hotel manager felt compelled to discount hotel rooms due to vermin. The task of Broome and hizzoner-elect will be to tell that story to the outside world.

Gustave "Gus" Perna, commander of Army Materiel Command. The general spoke with government and industry officials during a forum on modernization at the Association of the United States Army's annual meeting in Washington, Military.com reported.  © Photo: Pixabay China Invites Microsoft, Intel to Join Elaboration of Cybersecurity Standards "We need to face that with some stark reality, and we better do it quickly or we are going to have systems on the battlefield that we are not going to be able to operate despite the supply chain or the training of our soldiers." "We are going to have to teach them how to deal with a cyber attack," reiterated Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisitions Katharina McFarland in the same forum. "How do you think in the time of austerity, in the time of war; to have that speed to know what to do; to be able to maintain the most important capability that you need to have?" Cyber attacks may not be as clear as damage to physical objects often is, McFarland pointed out. But, "It's a big deal; they have to have the confidence to know how to come out on the other end," she said.  In June Defense One reported that the US military acknowledged that it still cannot fully test its ability to respond to catastrophic cyber attacks on civilian infrastructure and likely will not be able to until 2019. Following its Cyber Guard exercise, which gathered representatives from the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, and the FBI to practice fighting off a network attack on US infrastructure, Brigadier General Charles L. Moore, the Joint Chiefs of Staff deputy director for global operations, told the House Armed Services Committee, "We don’t have the scale or the complexity to truly represent a realistic and relevant threat, the ones that we’re truly trying to train to." © AP Photo/ Richard Drew CIA Director Brennan Expects New Attempts to Disclose US Election Information The Military Times reported in June on the ongoing lack of materiel and training capacity at US Cyber Command, saying that six years after the organization's creation, it still lacked a training environment for large-scale exercises necessary to evaluate its overall readiness. Cyber Command, headquartered in Fort Meade, Maryland, lacks a permanent interconnected range for units to practice tactics, test weaponry and engage in conflict exercises.  "We don't have — but we need — an exercise environment where you do rehearsals, go against adversary networks, and figure out ways to better protect your own," retired Air Force Major General Jim Keffer, formerly chief of staff of Cyber Command in 2015, told Military Times. "For individual training, I think we’re really good. But the team training, the force-on-force training, that is primarily limited by a lack of a persistent training environment." At the Air Force Association’s 2016 Air, Space and Cyber Conference in late September, Air Force Gen. Ellen Pawlikowski echoed similar concerns, saying, "we have to take a serious look at cyber security for our weapon systems in ways that a couple of years ago we didn’t think about," Military.com reported. The service must understand where cyber threats to its systems originate, she said.  The service will develop a Cyber Security Engineering Team within its Life Cycle Management Center to ensure that weapons system upgrades do not introduce new threat opportunities, she said. ...

Login Register Public Release: 4-Oct-2016 EARTH: Thirsty business -- How the tech industry is bracing for a water scarce future American Geosciences Institute Share  Print  E-Mail Alexandria, VA - Server farms do the heavy lifting to meet public demand for information, from emails and tweets to credit card transactions and video streaming. Buildings that house the servers require tremendous amounts of energy to keep the servers running, and even more water to keep them functioning and cool. As the need for warehouses of servers has grown, tech giants like Facebook, Google and Microsoft have started building data centers in seemingly out-of-the-way places for good reason: because the local climates can reduce the energy and water needs for the operations. Not to be left behind, the semiconductor industry - led by companies like Intel - are also innovating to reduce their water usage. The October issue of EARTH Magazine explores the multitude of ways the tech industry is trying to address the hard reality of water as a finite resource. These solutions range from submerging server rooms underwater, using creative programming to maximize processing during daily temperature cycles, employing sensing equipment, and using dry chemical reactions and high frequency sound waves to reduce water used during the cleaning processes associated with microchip development. These efforts are not just a safeguard for the environment; disruption in chip manufacturing or data centers could have the potential to wreak havoc on profits. EARTH finds that there is a community of businesses, sustainability organizations and creative engineers at the helm, navigating the tech industry into a more sustainable and predictable future, not as reliant on the natural cycles of the planet. Read the full article at: http://bit.ly/2d2m7FW. The October Issue of EARTH Magazine is now available for digital download from http://www.earthmagazine.org, or in print in the September/October dual issue. In it, you'll find stories about how lack of afterslip following the Nepal earthquake is hinting at mounting plate tensions, how clouds can form in the absence of nucleating particles, and new research that suggests that the reaches of the Milky Way may now be invisible to a third of humanity.

NVDA is a great company that has a lot going for it, except for the valuation By Ryan Fuhrmann, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Oct 4, 2016, 12:46 pm EST     View All   Popular Posts: 3 Beaten-Down Biotech Stocks to Buy for Huge Gains Recent Posts: 3 Beaten-Down Biotech Stocks to Buy for Huge Gains 3 Beaten-Down Healthcare Stocks to Buy 3 Blue-Chip Stocks With Hidden Benefits View All Posts Visual computing microchip player Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) updated its shareholders in August by reporting a number of financial records and milestones for NVDA stock. Revenue, gross margins and operating income all reached significant all-time levels, and management is rapidly pursuing a business transformation to enter growth markets. Source: via Nvidia Just a few years ago, personal computers and stodgy corporate applications represented over 40% of sales. Today, that is down to 9%. In its place are chips, applications and systems that support gaming, virtual reality and driverless car markets. It all sounds exciting, but investors could be at risk by moving wholeheartedly into unproven and competitive new markets. NVDA stock is up big so far this year (108%). The key question is whether that will continue, and whether large or upstart competitors stand a chance of squashing it in the future. What Does Nvidia Do? NVDA focuses on visual computing, which it thinks is a huge growth area. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is its biggest rival, which also happens to compete with Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC); this rivalry best illustrates that Nvidia is a microchip company. Its key focus is graphic chips, and its four market segments certainly suggest that the underlying industries it serves do indeed have significant expansion potential. 7 Debt-Free Stocks That Will Survive the Coming Bear Market Its most significant segment is gaming, with Sony Corp (ADR) (NYSE:SNE) likely a big customer because of its PlayStation gaming franchise. NVDA boasts that its chips help gamers “enjoy immersive fantasy worlds.” Virtual reality, such as Facebook Inc’s (NASDAQ:FB) Oculus Rift headset, is certainly a newer market, but it could really take off in the gaming space. Nvidia already has existing products in the space, including SHIELD (portable devices for mobile gaming) and GRID (cloud-based applications). Gaming accounted for $2.8 billion in revenue last year and has grown sales nearly 30% annually over the last three years. Total sales last year were just over $5 billion. Pro-Visualization is NVDA’s next largest market, though at $750 million in sales last year, it is much smaller than gaming. Growth has also been negative over the last few years, though management is hopeful its visual computing solutions for the automotive, media and entertainment industries picks up more. Datacenter and Auto each represented around $330 million of revenue last year. They are growing like gangbusters. Datacenter solutions are growing 40% annually, while auto is off the charts at 80% a year. The auto segment has perhaps the most compelling upside potential going forward. The development of self-driving cars is still in its infancy, and Nvidia plans to be a leader in the space for many years to come. The Big Picture for Nvidia Stock NVDA’s sales have consistently grown at 7% a year for a decade now. Analysts expect a rather large jump this year, with the top line growing as much as 22% to $6.1 billion. For 2017, they project growth returns to 7% and sales reach $6.5 billion. For the year, the current earnings expectation is $1.85 per share, or 20% growth from last year. Profit growth has averaged an impressive 20% for three years now, though, again, the 10-year average is right around 10%. The financial picture for NVDA stock looks very healthy. Nvidia has no long-term debt and over $5 billion in cash in the bank. Cash production is great; operating cash flow was $1.2 billion last year to double the reported net income. Capital expenditure is minimal, and annual dividends only require about $200 million to support the quarterly payout. NVDA Downsides: The Valuation and Competition For all that NVDA stock has going for it, it is far from cheap. The trailing price-to-earnings ratio is 45X and only a slightly more reasonable 36X on a forward basis. The cash flow multiple is around 20X given the company generates so much cash, but that is hardly bargain-basement level pricing for Nvidia stock.

IAM Magazine Login Reset password Toggle navigation Home Home Magazine Blog Market intelligence Top patent professionals Top IP strategists International reports Events Media IPBC New research puts annual licensing return from mobile market at $14.3 billion or just over $7 a phone 04 Oct 16 < Back to Blogs Richard Lloyd Exactly how much is being made from licensing patents to mobile phone manufacturers has become a touchstone issue in recent years leading to some wildly different numbers. The perceived power that the likes of Qualcomm, Nokia and Ericsson hold over the manufacturing community was underlined by a 2014 paper from WilmerHale and Intel which estimated that on a hypothetical $400 phone the royalty stack could be in excess of $120. But according to a new paper, which studied the licensing revenues of 32 major licensors to the mobile sector, the royalty stack is likely to be much lower, accounting for just $14.3 billion in annual licensing revenues or 3.3% of the total value of the smartphone and feature phone markets in 2015. The paper, “A new dataset on mobile phone patent license royalties”, calculates that that translates to just $7.25 of the average sales price of a phone of $221.80. The authors – Professor Stephen Haber of Stanford, Professor Alexander Galetovic of the Universidad de los Andes in Chile and Lew Zaretski, the head of IP strategy firm Hamilton IPV – make clear that they are not taking a position on the level of the royalty rate. However, in joining the band of academics attempting to throw some light on this opaque subject, the trio are clearly trying to prove that the concern that patent owners are subjecting the likes of Apple and Samsung to unduly high licensing rates is unfounded. The problem for anyone looking to apply rigorous analysis to licensing rates is that most deals remain private. As a result, the paper’s authors use a mixture of publicly available material, such as financial disclosures from the largest licensors like Qualcomm, other material they can glean from the public record and estimates from those businesses where licensing revenues are not materially significant and are therefore not disclosed in financial filings. The authors appear acutely aware of the challenges and limitations in calculating licensing revenues and in the interests of full transparency include an excel spreadsheet which details all of the underlying data and their sources. In one interesting side note, the paper estimates that Huawei is earning, just on its mobile phone patents, roughly 20% of all patent revenues earned by all Chinese companies in any line of economic activity. That shows the company’s undoubted status, in patent terms at least, as China’s most powerful tech company, but also the embryonic status of the country’s outbound licensing market. I got in touch with Professor Haber and asked him why the authors had decided to write the paper. “We were motivated to undertake the study because all kinds of numbers about the "royalty stack" in a mobile phone get tossed around among academics, industry practitioners, and government officials--but many of those numbers are not generated by a theoretically-informed, empirically sound, and replicable method,” he wrote in an email. “Science has to start with the facts; with evidence dispassionately gathered.  Our purpose is to provide as comprehensive, transparent, and theoretically informed data source as is practically possible for use by other researchers, industry practitioners, and government officials.  As our paper states: "We do not take a position on whether the estimates of the royalty yield we present in this study are 'too high,' 'too low,' or 'just right.'   That is an important debate, but it can only be joined on the basis of evidence."  Haber points out that the authors are building on the work of others (the paper cites previous studies by Keith Mallinson and J Gregory Sidak) so they are not the first to contradict the sky-high royalty estimates made by some. Such is the nature of this debate that it will likely run for a little while yet, but this latest piece is a valuable contribution to a very hot topic.  Sectors Licensing Patents IP business IP valuation Comments RE: New research puts annual licensing return from mobile market at $14.3 billion or just over $7 a phone Interesting: I remember a talk given by Sandeep Chennasekhu of Ericsson Mobile at LES Scandinavia, 2005 in which he stated that licensing fees were 15% of the costs of their phones (7% for tech licensing, 8% for "essential IPR) compared with only a total of 3% in 2000 and he was expecting that it would increase to 20% by 2010. I wonder whether Apple, Samsung, Lenovo or any of the other current major manufacturers have made any comments on the paper by Haber and his colleagues?

By Teena Maddox | October 4, 2016, 7:15 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStock/Getty Images, eternalcreative VMware and APX Labs are partnering on a new solution that could make smart glasses more enterprise-friendly, the pair announced on Tuesday at AirWatch Connect in Atlanta. The new, integrated solution improves management and support of smart glasses for professional users. More about Mobility CIO Jury: 10 out of 12 tech leaders trust Samsung despite Galaxy Note7 failure IBM Watson is coming to the iPhone, and that's big news for business users Tech Pro Research: Social media policy Subscribe to TechRepublic's Mobile Enterprise newsletter The solution combines APX Labs' Skylight platform with VMware's AirWatch enterprise mobility management (EMM) platform in order to allow IT administrators to manage smart glasses, ensure compliance with security policies, and configure user-specific variables using a single device management console. VMware is also collaborating with Atheer, Intel, ODG and VUZIZ Corp. to deliver wearable management and app delivery solutions at scale. "This will reduce the burden of IT admins not needing to touch every single device to make sure everything is configured right," said Jay Kim, CSO of APX Labs. SEE: AirWatch Connect: VMware boosts unified endpoint management, BYOD security with new features (TechRepublic) Smart glasses and augmented reality are a growing component of the enterprise. Earlier this year, a Tech Pro Research report, Virtual and Augmented Reality in the Enterprise: Cost factors, benefits, future plans, revealed that 67% of companies not already using AR are considering it at their organization, and another 39% of companies are already using it. This shows a strong interest in AR, and integrated solutions that save money could help further drive adoption, since cost was deemed as a critical factor by 92% of respondents in the report. The new device management solution from VMware and APX Labs includes: Simplified workflows in initial deployments and post-deployment management of smart glasses. Significantly reduced overhead for managing end-to-end configurations on smart glasses. Streamlined on-boarding experiences, network setup and application deployment. Minimized enterprise security risk of deploying smart glasses through management, provisioning, blacklisting, and end-to-end data protection. "Previously, companies have had to manage smart glasses nearly one pair at a time. That worked when there were only a handful of smart glasses in use, but is simply not sustainable once an organization is ready to deploy hundreds and thousands of pairs of smart glasses across their hands-on workforce," said Ramon T. Llamas, research manager for IDC's wearables team, in a press release. "Enabling IT administrators to more easily manage and secure these devices at scale and in a way that administrators already manage other smart connected devices is incredibly important. This capability and partnership is a natural extension to enterprise mobility, and is a real win for customers." The enterprise will be able to more quickly adopt wearables as a result of this new solution, Kim said, explaining that it will drive additional deployments and additional scale because it will make wearables easier and more cost efficient to deploy and manage. "It's a huge milestone moment for APX because this was a capability we'd been working with our customers' IT departments to bring to life. It's been challenging to scale our deployments without this in place," Kim said. Brian Ballard, CEO of APX Labs, said in a press release: "The integration with VMware AirWatch is also significant for our Skylight platform as it helps in 'future-proofing' our clients' investment in smart glasses. The AR smart glasses hardware landscape is growing and is quite dynamic. So, as companies gain more experience with these new types of devices and deploy them at scale, it will be handled from the same enterprise mobility management platform, providing a significant advantage in reduction of overall IT overhead, time and total cost of ownership." Three takeaways for TechRepublic readers: VMware and APX Labs have partnered to create a fully integrated enterprise solution for managing deployment and support for smart glasses. The new solution could accelerate the adoption of smart glasses in the enterprise because it makes the devices easier and more cost efficient to manage. A Tech Pro Research report showed that 67% of companies not already using AR are considering it in the future, which could set the stage for growing smart glasses adoption.

Pay $30 Billion For NXP Semiconductors? Will the world’s largest mobile chipmaker also become the largest vendor of automotive chips? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Oct 4, 2016 at 10:24AM Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), the largest mobile chipmaker in the world, is reportedly in talks to acquire Dutch chipmaker NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) for over $30 billion. NXP became the world's largest automotive chipmaker last year after acquiring rival Freescale for nearly $12 billion. Let's discuss why Qualcomm might be interested in buying NXP, and whether or not it can afford such a massive purchase. Image source: Qualcomm. Why Qualcomm needs NXP Analysts expect Qualcomm's revenue and earnings to each decline about 8% this year for two main reasons. First, its chipmaking division -- which generates most of its revenue -- is ceding market share to cheaper mobile rivals like MediaTek and first-party chips from OEMs like Apple, Samsung, and Huawei. Second, the higher-margin licensing division, which generates most of the company's profits with licensing fees for 3G and 4G technologies, remains under pressure from defiant OEMs and government regulators. These parties believe that Qualcomm's cut (3% to 5% of the wholesale price of each smartphone sold worldwide) makes it too hard to profit from sales of low-margin smartphones. In response, Qualcomm is diversifying into new markets beyond smartphones and tablets. These adjacent markets include wearables, drones, smart appliances, connected cars, and various other gadgets across the Internet of Things (IoT). To accelerate that expansion, Qualcomm acquired IoT chipmaker CSR for $2.4 billion last year and launched specialized Snapdragon chips for wearables, drones, cars, and other devices. Image source: Getty Images. However, other rival chipmakers are eyeing the same markets. Intel, which faces stagnant growth in PC and data center chips, launched its own IoT division in late 2013. Nvidia has expanded aggressively into the auto industry with chips for infotainment systems, ADAS (advanced driver assistance systems), and turnkey solutions for autonomous cars. To widen its moat against these challengers, Qualcomm must make a game-changing move like buying NXP. In addition to making Qualcomm the 800-pound gorilla in connected cars and giving it competitive bundling opportunities, gaining NXP's NFC chip business would boost Qualcomm's content share in iPhones and other devices -- thus reducing the impact of its loss of some iPhone modem orders to Intel in the iPhone 7. But can Qualcomm afford NXP? NXP stock currently has a 5-year PEG ratio of 0.7. Since a PEG ratio under 1 is considered undervalued, NXP is considered cheap relative to its growth potential. Buying NXP could add nearly $10 billion to Qualcomm's projected revenues of $23.7 billion next year, giving it a robust third business unit to offset declines at the chipmaking and licensing segments. However, $30 billion would still be a huge amount for Qualcomm to pay. Qualcomm finished last quarter with $5.9 billion in cash and equivalents and $11.2 billion in marketable securities. It's also shouldering $1.7 billion in short-term debt and $10 billion in long-term debt. Therefore, any deal would require Qualcomm to pay in stock and cash, and take on more debt to make up the difference. However, taking on more debt now, before the Fed further raises interest rates, would likely be a smart long-term move. But it cannot be ignored that buying NXP would significantly increase Qualcomm's debt -- which was non-existent before it financed $10 billion in buybacks with debt last year -- to historically high levels. If it went through with the acquisition it wouldn't be surprising if Qualcomm suspended its buybacks after buying NXP. However, I doubt that Qualcomm will stop raising its dividend, which has been hiked annually for 13 consecutive years and is easily covered by its free cash flow. But let's not get ahead of ourselves Shares of NXP have surged after the rumors initially appeared in the Wall Street Journal. But the subsequent rally boosted NXP's enterprise value to $33 billion, indicating that an acquisition premium has already been priced in. The Journal also claims that Qualcomm is exploring other deals, and that a potential deal probably wouldn't be struck for at least two to three months. So if the deal falls through, NXP could give up its gains very quickly. Qualcomm would certainly benefit from buying NXP -- but the acquisition buzz is all speculative for now.

It’s understood OpenSDS was presented to Linux Foundation reps on a recent visit to China. The idea is that vendors’ products would plug into one side of the finished OpenSDS and third parties’ tools and software, such as Docker, Kubernetes or OpenStack, into the other. OpenSDS aims to replace the litany of proprietary management frameworks underpinning storage. It's analogous to the Eclipse Framework in software tools from the 2000s. Eclipse eradicated an entire culture of proprietary IDE frameworks for something that was open and extensible. Eclipse not only brought down barriers to development for IDE plug-in providers, it also saved the IDE makers the cost and time to constantly update their individual frameworks' IDE plumbing. Cameron Bahar, Huawei storage senior vice president and global chief technology officer, told The Reg at LinuxCon, Berlin, that some storage vendors have as many as 37 storage management frameworks in their own companies - although he wouldn’t name names. Some vendors have open-sourced elements of their own management tools and drivers over the years, but they have generally aimed at solving specific issues and have followed lobbying by big names such as Intel. With OpenSDS, however, Huawei wants to sweep away this piecemeal approach. Dell EMC is understood to have this week gained legal clearance to join OpenSDS. A formal announcement on all new members is planned for a future date. "All the vendors are talking," Bahar said - adding there are no commitments yet. He stressed the importance of customer involvement in OpenSDS. "This is not just a vendor-driven effort - we are in discussions with enterprises and telcos. We are inviting customers and vendors to join this effort." For those customers, he said, OpenSDS promised greater openness and choice. "Customers will get to manage multi-vendor and multi-orchestration frameworks like Kubernetes, OpenStack and Mesos." The point is to get vendor support and bring lots of vendors together, the CTO said. “There’s an opportunity for Dell EMC and others that would like people to interoperate.” Bahar said he reckoned more storage firms would join OpenSDS once there is a critical mass of names. This would mean less lock-in through the storage management layer and genuine competition among firms on the capabilities and features of their storage hardware and software rather than the controller. Also, it would mean customers could quickly take advantage of new trends moving through storage, such as containers and cloud, as developers could easily target the open framework rather than waiting on the storage vendors themselves to update their own proprietary software. OpenSDS would define the interfaces, common management APIs and simple orchestration that would be made generally available to the community and updated on an ongoing basis through open source. The framework would provide the discovery, provisioning and orchestration and potentially be capable of talking to virtualized, containerised and bare metal environments. Two open-source projects that would immediately benefit are Kubernetes and OpenStack. Kubernetes must be implemented differently for each vendor's storage controllers despite the fact that it is solving the same issue of persistent storage. Using OpenSDS, just a single agent could be developed. OpenStack, meanwhile, does have the Manilla and Cinder projects for file share and volumes but lacks basic storage management functionality for discovery, configuration and management. Again, a single agent could be built through OpenSDS that would solve this. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 3 Comments More from The Register Linux's NFV crew: Operators keen to ditch clunky networks, be 'cool' like, er, Facebook OPNFV Summit Moving as fast as embiggened bods can shift 9 Comments Shall we Drupal 8?

PlatformPlayStation 4Xbox One DeveloperFiraxis Publisher2K Games Reviewed OnXbox One Release Date September 30, 2016.   Despite our best efforts, stunning tactical thinking and snazzy wardrobe choices, it would appear that we lost the war with our alien invaders sometime after the events of XCOM: Enemy Within. Worse still, they now rule us under the guise of an organisation called “Advent” who lord over us like, well, overlords, enforcing curfews and totalitarian laws and stealing us away in the night to experiment on. Your “character”, XCOM’s tactical Commander, is imprisoned in a forced coma, alien-human hybrids patrol the streets, they’ve closed every branch of John Lewis, and the world is generally a very bleak and distressing place. Welcome back. Luckily, those plucky few who strove to defend our Earth are still around, beaten but not defeated, forgotten but not gone. Interestingly, if you play the tutorial you’re tasked with rescuing yourself from an Advent holding facility. Becoming an underground guerrilla organisation doesn’t seem to have phased XCOM, who still pull ex-soldiers from all over the globe and outfit them with the coolest new tech, but who now operate from aboard an Avengers-style heli-carrier named, ironically, the Avenger. As with the last game, it’s worth playing the tutorial once to get the feel of the game and its systems, but then you’d be advised to restart immediately and skip it. It’s very restrictive for the first 30 to 60 minutes, dictating who lives and dies in the initial encounter, and even what to do when you first return to active duty alongside returning character Colonel Bradford (now older and more grizzled), and newbies Dr Tygan and Lily Shen (daughter of the last game’s late Chief Engineer). By skipping the tutorial you can earn promotions for all four deployed soldiers in the first mission, and you’re free to build whatever room you want initially instead of having to do what you’re told. The Avenger is a re-purposed alien ship and, as such, is still being rebuilt. That means clearing debris in the middle are of the craft and installing your own rooms. The Guerrilla Tactics facility, for example, allows you to increase your squad size, give your characters permanent buffs and even train a rookie in a specific class so you don’t have to wait for fate to assign it, while the Proving Ground allows you to develop specialist gear for specific missions, such as the brain-draining Skulljack, or research experimental grenades and ammo types. Power and space are of primary concern here, but if you want to do well outside the Avenger you’ll also need to be gathering Intel, which is used as a currency for recruiting soldiers, establishing communications with global resistance cells, and scanning potential hot spots. Supplies, on the other hand, equal cash, which is the second currency and the one that makes research and development possible. If you want to outfit your squads with plated armour, magnetic weaponry and advanced scopes, you’ll need plenty of money. If you played Enemy Unknown or indeed Within, you’ll feel right at home when your feet hit the ground. XCOM 2 changes very little in terms of the overall mechanics, instead tweaking, refining and adding to what was already there. Assault units are now Rangers, and can use a close-combat melee attack on an enemy; Medics are now “Specialists” and work with a drone to either assist your squad or harry the enemy and hack their systems; Heavies have become Grenadiers, and Snipers are Sharpshooters. While the basic abilities remain the same, the branching paths are much more defined. For example, the Sharpshooter can choose Sniper or Gunslinger perks, the former of which make them deadlier at a distance, and the latter of which increase their lethality with a sidearm, allowing them to devastate enemies with pinpoint accuracy up close. Once again, you’re responsible for everything about your soldier from their name, country of origin and their voice to their appearance, class, skill progression and gear. Losing a favourite to a silly mistake is incredibly upsetting, and it adds an element of tension that never loses its effectiveness. You’re always worried for your soldiers, and the longer they’re with you, the more attached you get. Missions vary nicely, tasking you to escort VIPs, clear out alien bases, raid supply lines, hack their mainframes or rescue civilians. Sometimes you’ll embark on a mission just to rescue a new Engineer or Scientist who will speed up your construction and research on the Avenger. Story missions see you raiding or infiltrating Advent “Blacksites” in order to slow progress in the Avatar Project, a world-ending program developed by Advent that acts as the “doomsday clock”. Once the progress bar is complete, you have only 20 in-game days to save the world. It doesn’t feel as restrictive as Enemy Unknown’s timer, thankfully, and you still have plenty of time to complete side missions and level up your soldiers and base. Movement around the grid-based map is the same as before, as is the turn-based combat, and it’s all about positioning your soldiers, flanking the enemy and working as coordinated team to bring down the enemy threat. Lone wolfs don’t survive for long, and reckless Commanders lose soldiers fast as Advent will often punish a mistake with ruthless efficiency. Unless increased by a buff or item, characters only have limited movement options. You can either attack first and stay where you are, dash over double the distance of normal movement but take no second action, or move within a limited space and then use an action afterwards, either to shoot, throw a grenade, heal an ally or hack a computer. In a nice touch, some enemies now drop lootable gear upon death, which you’ll need to salvage within only a few turns. Particularly in the early game, the random number generator (RNG) that controls your hit/dodge chance is horribly one-sided. Your operatives often struggle to land shots with 80% chances of success, while the enemy rarely misses. As your squad develop, they improve, but XCOM 2 remains a challenging game throughout. Certain enemies are simply nightmarish; even the lowly Sectoids, now evolved since their Enemy Unknown appearance, can be a challenge, as they’re able to revive dead Advent soldiers and confuse, blind or even mind-control your troops. If nothing else, XCOM 2 keeps you on the back foot at all times. Sadly, the multiplayer element still feels tacked-on, and simply isn’t played by enough people to guarantee a game against any but the well-honed. You can field Advent squads, which is very cool, but the actual gameplay remains mostly the same. Except this time, you’re not only dealing with the RNG, you’re also dealing with free-thinking human opponents who either know how to beat you or know how to cheese you. It’s fun enough, but the maps are the same as the ones you see in the campaign and the overall atmosphere is no different. XCOM 2 on consoles comes with DLC that, among other things, allows you to field a Mech and sets Terminator-hard aliens on you that will test even the strongest military mind – even on the Rookie setting. Despite that, though, it’s very much business as usual. It’s an evolution, not a revolution, and one that suffers from some terrible porting hangovers. While the minute to minute combat runs well enough, there are terrible bouts of slowdown during the loading screens, and it has crashed on me three times so far. It can also be very glitchy, with characters clipping through the environment, running on the spot, teleporting to different areas, or stuttering when they run from cover to cover. But aside technical issues and gripes with the difficulty, XCOM 2 is a massively enjoyable, engrossing game. The atmosphere is palpable and the sense of paternity or maternity you feel for your force of operatives never fails to deliver a unique and exciting experience. Bringing everyone through a successful mission unscathed rewards you with a tremendous feeling of achievement. Nothing ground-breaking, then, but a worthy follow-up to one of the best tactical action games out there. Review code provided by publisher. Read our original PC version review.

Tuesday October 4, 2016 09:40 PM GMT+8 ICYMI The Edit: Must-visit destinations in 2017 The Edit: Killers release Christmas compilation Secret hero’s burial for Marcos draws street protests Trump taps Sessions for AG, Pompeo for CIA, insider says Advertisement More stories                Tools Increase Text Decrease Text Reset Text Print Article The X2 Concept is a subtly stunning show car that will go into production within the next two years as a crossover coupe. ― AFP picPARIS, Oct 4 ― At this year’s Paris Motor Show, BMW officially unveiled a facelifted 3 Series Gran Turismo, a 300km range version of its plug-in electric i3 city car, a new electric scooter and the X2 Concept, a subtly stunning show car that will be going into production within the next two years as a crossover coupe. However, the biggest line of questioning aimed at the company’s global head of Sales and Marketing, Dr. Ian Robertson, was about what is coming next in terms of connected and autonomous cars. Perhaps that’s unsurprising given that BMW is a one-third owner in the hugely ambitious HERE mapping and car data platform and that it recently announced an equally ambitious partnership with Intel and Mobileye that aims to build a completely autonomous production car within the next five years. “The next big step will be the iNext, in 2021,” said Robertson about the car that will not only boast self-driving skills but also an alternative powertrain and cutting-edge connectivity. However, in the process of building this next-generation car, current generation buyers will also benefit. “Along the way, [its] technology will spread through the brand,” he explains. BMW is at the pinnacle of what’s possible with internal combustion engines, but doesn’t trying to be a leader in the tech world go against the philosophy of a brand that is all about driving passion? “I think the two things go together,” responds Robertson. “The DNA of BMW always was innovation and technology. That’s what we are, that’s what we’ve always been and that’s what our brand stands for. It’s what our customers expect so you can expect us to keep pushing those boundaries. The fact that we now have thousands of software engineers ― that’s part of that development.” Driving pleasure and the autonomous world But even with a burgeoning tech department, to bring real-time connectivity and alerts to fruition that cut accidents, eradicate congestion and take the pain out of motoring, BMW needs Intel supercomputing and Mobileye vision systems. “We wanted to drive this forward,” explains Robertson. And where the partners want to drive it to is to the point where it is a secure, cloud-based platform with phenomenal real-time data crunching skills that is “Open source so that other parties will be able to use it,” Robertson points out. Initially it will use real-time data from BMWs, Audis and Mercedes cars but anyone will be able to integrate the system into their production cars, boosting its capability while reducing industry reliance on tech firms such as Google. Real-time mapping and traffic alerts are things that all types of drivers and all types of cars would benefit from, but the move to full autonomous driving could still be a big gamble for BMW, a company obsessed with driver dynamics. Robertson is quick to disagree. For the moment at least, the technology will make driving even better. “I’m driving a new 7 series. It is semi-autonomous. I drive the first 25km in an autobahn environment, unrestricted. I drive over 250km/h. It makes me feel good in the morning and in the evening. But the last 10km are always in bumper-to-bumper traffic. I stick it into the mode that allows semi autonomy. I don’t need to use my feet any more. I can take my hands off the wheel, I can take my eyes off the road, briefly, and that for me is marrying the autonomous world with sheer driving pleasure in an urban environment because not all of it is that much fun.” ― AFP-Relaxnews                MORE ON MMOTV Drive Channel Most Viewed Now Week VW to present new brand strategy in coming weeks, says brand chief Mercedes-Benz C63 S Coupe launched in Malaysia China SUV wars to heat up as Volkswagen unveils two new models Singapore ready to test self-driving electric scooter Jaguar XKSS: Resurrecting the original supercar (VIDEO) Mercedes-Benz C63 S Coupe launched in Malaysia Mazda SKYACTIV: What is it all about?

VMware AirWatch announces support for smart glasses Posted Oct 4, 2016 by Ron Miller (@ron_miller) 0 SHARES Next Story This crazy mod shaves off the edges of the iPhone using gigantic saw and belt sander Turns out Dreamforce isn’t the only enterprise conference going on this week. VMware is also holding its at AirWatch Connect conference in Atlanta, and today it announced support for enterprise smart glasses on the AirWatch enterprise mobility management platform. Smart glasses, which are essentially computers that sit on your face, haven’t found widespread usage quite yet, but the market is expected to grow to 16 million units by 2020, according to data from Gartner analyst Angela McIntyre. The deal puts agreements in place to work with some of the leading providers of smart glasses including APX Labs, Atheer, Intel, ODG and VUZIX Corp to help companies using these devices to streamline onboarding, connect the devices to company networks and deploy applications that run on the smart glasses. One of the things holding back more widespread use of these devices in the enterprise could possibly be a lack of management tools for IT to manage them the way they do other devices inside the organization. Brian Ballard, CEO of APX Labs thinks this agreement could be a big step forward in helping mainstream these devices in the enterprise. “Having wearable management now built into the VMware AirWatch Enterprise Mobility ManagementTM platform is a huge step forward in removing barriers to large scale adoption across the type of global customers we work with, and that’s paramount to not only our growth, but the growth of the entire industry,” Ballard said in a statement. These types of mobile devices could include computers worn on your face like Google Glass or augmented and virtual reality scenarios, depending on the requirements. They could be particularly useful in places where it’s difficult or dangerous to use your hands, and the computer could project instructions on what to do next, and even show you how to do it. It’s still very early days for these types of devices in the enterprise, and while big companies like GE and Boeing are experimenting with their usage inside their organizations, a deal like this could help push the industry forward and take it out of the realm of experimentation and help push it into the mainstream. It’s worth noting that Microsoft Hololens is noticeably absent from this announcement. That could be because initial support coming later this quarter will only involve devices running Android.

NEW PRESS RELEASE CATEGORIES ﻿ Business SGI Introduces Unique Scale-out Solution for SAP HANA® that Protects Investments When Moving to Real-time Business PR-Inside.com: 2016-10-04 15:02:01 SGI also surpasses 800 Terabyte (TB) milestone for total scale-up systems running SAP HANA MILPITAS, Calif., Oct. 04, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today, SGI (NASDAQ:SGI), a global leader in high-performance solutions for compute, data analytics and data management, announced that enterprises can now leverage the Intel-based SGI UV 300H server in a multi-node cluster (scale out) to run SAP® Business Warehouse (SAP BW) on SAP HANA® or new SAP BW/4HANA. Unique to SGI, the cluster nodes can later be reconfigured as single-node systems with 1 to 32TB of shared memory (scale up) to run SAP S/4HANA® and other real-time applications. SGI also announced that deployments of the SGI UV 300H as a single-node system provide in total over 800 Terabytes of in-memory computing capacity to organizations running the SAP HANA platform. These announcements reflect SGI's broadening leadership in high-performance data analytics and continuing innovation to achieve greater insight and gain competitive advantage with SAP HANA. SGI UV 300H is now SAP-certified under general availability in a clustered scale-out configuration to run SAP BW on SAP HANA or SAP BW/4HANA, using four to sixteen 8-socket nodes and up to 56 Terabytes of in-memory computing capacity. When business lines wish to move to real-time analytics utilizing SAP Business Suite on SAP HANA, SAP Bank Analyzer, SAP S/4HANA Finance, or other SAP S/4HANA applications, the clustered systems can be fully repurposed to form single-node systems with 4 to 32 sockets. By avoiding the need to "rip and replace" multi-node clusters when single-node systems are required, IT organizations can enjoy considerable cost savings by protecting investments and reduce time to solution. More than 100 single-node SGI UV 300H systems have been installed in organizations worldwide to provide data analytics in real time with SAP HANA and enable business lines to know when, where and how customers are buying without delay; view inventories, supply chains or financials with up-to-the-second accuracy; and spot market changes early and adjust with precision. These SGI systems deliver in total over 800 Terabytes of in-memory computing capacity - reflecting customer capacity growth in excess of 300% over the past twelve months.

AMD’s PRO lines of processors are akin to their consumer counterparts, except they run a guaranteed lifecycle of support with ‘image stability’ (guaranteed OS images) and extended OEM warranties. AMD’s PRO line typically covers both embedded systems via the BGA lower parts and commercial/enterprise systems with socketed units. This week AMD is announcing their PRO line using the latest AMD microarchitecture, Bristol Ridge, along with continued support for customer requested features. If you’ve ever browsed for an OEM system, or in a brick-and-mortar shop, you may have come across a system labeled something along the lines of ‘PRO A8’ using an AMD APU. I recently wrote a small news piece which involved an HP system in my local store with an OEM-only APU. These PRO parts enable an OEM to build a particular system, either as a business-to-business sale or directly to customers, and guarantee a fixed longevity for replacements to that system. This is a requirement for a lot of government and business electronic installations – the ability to replace like-for-like in the event of failure. AMD states that the unit shipments of their PRO processor line for commercial, enterprise and the public sector has risen by 45% since mid-2014, or a 20.4% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). The processors announced today are direct analogues of the consumer grade processors announced a couple of weeks ago, identical in specifications but with PRO in the name and a direct focus on support structures, management, virtualization, security and performance comparisons. AMD 7th Generation Bristol Ridge PRO Processors   Modules/ Threads L2 Cache CPU Base /  Turbo (MHz) GPU SPs GPU Base /  Turbo (MHz) TDP PRO A12-9800 2M / 4T 2 MB 3800 / 4200 512 800 / 1108 65W PRO A10-9700 2M / 4T 2 MB 3500 / 3800 384 720 / 1029 65W PRO A8-9600 2M / 4T 2 MB 3100 / 3400 384 655 / 900 65W PRO A6-9500 1M / 2T 1 MB 3500 / 3800 384 720 / 1029 65W   PRO A12-9800E 2M / 4T 2 MB 3100 / 3800 512 655 / 900 35W PRO A10-9700E 2M / 4T 2 MB 3000 / 3500 384 600 / 847 35W PRO A6-9500E 1M / 2T 1 MB 3000 / 3400 256 576 / 800 35W All these processors will support DDR4-2400 as standard, and offer USB 3.1 (10 Gbps) support via the appropriate chipset and Type-C with a re-driver chip to support reversible insertion (this is the same as the consumer platform). These new processors are all socketed parts designed for the AM4 platform for now, with BGA components likely to be declared later down the line. With the PRO APUs, AMD uses an ARM Cortex-A5 to implement ARM TrustZone, offering software agnostic (compared to Intel which does not) support for hardware-based security. This includes Secure Boot, Content Protection, per-Application security, fTPM 2.0, and support for Microsoft Device Guard, Windows Hello, independent fingerprint security, data protection and Bitlocker, among other things. AMD supports this via the DASH management protocol, which is ultimately CPU agnostic and allows users of other DASH systems to get up to speed. AMD is positioning the APUs to be comparable to various Intel counterparts. Performance-wise, for the launch, AMD states that in small form factors at 35W and mid-tier at 65W, performance compared to Intel is within 8% for the CPU, but AMD can offer +50-95% in graphics based or graphics accelerated workloads. In this case, AMD was positioning the PRO A12-9800E against the Core i5-6500T for the CPU comparison, and the PRO A12-9800 against the i5-6500 for the graphics comparison. We’ve asked to get these processors in for testing in order to compare. The first systems using the new 7th Gen PRO APUs will be a set of HP Elitedesk 705 G3 systems, in Mini, SFF and mini-tower form factors. Due to the way these commercial systems are promoted, pricing and specifications will depend highly on the support contract aligned with the business customers. AMD is keen to point out that other customers will release their Bristol Ridge PRO based systems over the coming months.

Reply ilt24 - Tuesday, October 04, 2016 - link Are you going to do any Bristol Ridge benchmarking? Reply ddriver - Tuesday, October 04, 2016 - link Why bother, it says it is 17% faster than i5 LOL... Now, I don't doubt that its iGPU will be faster than the vanilla intel iGPU, but those 17% better "system performance" makes me skeptical. Probably some abstract term that has little to nothing to do with CPU performance. Reply MrSpadge - Tuesday, October 04, 2016 - link Only with OpenCL acceleration in a few hand-picked corner cases. Reply Meteor2 - Tuesday, October 04, 2016 - link That 17% claim is bizarre, when their previous slides suggest parity for 'system' performance against an i5, at best. I've looked through the slides and can't see how they can claim that. Reply KOneJ - Tuesday, October 04, 2016 - link There is a footnote stating that the 17% greater performance was comparing the Intel Core i5-6500T with the AMD A12-9800E, which both officially have a 35W TDP. They can claim that under a particular benchmark (I may very well be mistaken but I think that it's PCMark Home 8. Don't quote me on that though.) which takes into account both the CPU and the iGPU performance and how it affects "productivity" across a variety of workloads. The parity is the A12-9800 with a 65W TDP against the i5-6500 with a 65W TDP. AMD compares favorably in the given benchmark at lower power envelopes due to the strength of the APU's iGPU. Don't get me wrong, but while I prefer AMD to Intel for both their product and the philosophy/principles/attitude, and I am a huge advocate for Bulldozer not having been Faildozer but rather a decent CMT uArch that got screwed by compilers under Windoze (In contrast with Gentoo...) and had difficulty with power efficiency and platform aging for servers, I can't argue that under Windoze for CPU-related tasks in general, the 17% claim is slated the wrong way. Yes, the APU's GCN-based iGPU smokes Intel's HD Graphics iGPUs (Iris [Pro] comes closer though that gets a lot more complex...), and yes, for people who play games at basic settings, it makes more sense without a dGPU, the fact is that if you're not rendering anything with the iGPU, the i5 is the better chip. Furthermore, it isn't known what the precise memory configurations were and performance varies from motherboard to motherboard. It may have been the i5 was running on an H110 motherboard with 3200MHz CL15 RAM running at 2133MHz since only Z170/X99 can use XMP OC profiles for DDR4, while the A12 was running on an X370 chipset motherboard with the same RAM at their maximum frequencies, boosting the iGPU. Or maybe not. The foot-note may have provided more info, or perhaps it didn't. Even then, ambient temperatures, airflow, thermal compound, and the CPU cooler used can all affect performance. I'm sure AMD's marketing department did their best to favor their new product no differently than Intel would. Again, not at all hating on AMD, and hating a little on Intel for some of their anti-competitive nature (I still consider Intel to be a very decent company, unlike Nvidia...), but those numbers were pulled from a marketing hat under narrow circumstances and should be disregarded. Under Windoze for most tasks that most people encounter mot of the time, the i5 is definitely the better chip. I any case, I hope this was enlightening. Cheers Reply lmcd - Tuesday, October 04, 2016 - link Consider paragraph breaks, less things like "Windoze," and fewer anecdotes. Reply Meteor2 - Tuesday, October 04, 2016 - link I found it very interesting! Reply Enverex - Wednesday, October 05, 2016 - link "Iris [Pro] comes closer" - It doesn't. The Iris Pro series (e.g. 6200 and 580) massively outperform AMD's top APU. I'd agree if you were comparing the low-end basic ones they use, but not the Iris Pro range. Reply plonk420 - Thursday, October 06, 2016 - link i assume AMD is going to be more affordable than $250...

With the election just around the corner, I'm concerned that very few of those running discuss or understand the importance of tech in our future. In a recent column, I laid out seven areas where tech is about to explode and have a major impact on our country and world. Yet I hear very little about tech growth on the campaign trail. One of the more interesting aspects of my 35 years of covering high tech has been to chronicle its role and impact on our world. It has also allowed me to see firsthand the various nuances between the worlds of tech, big business, and the US government and the changing role tech has had on the latter two. Indeed, for the first 50 years of the tech explosion, dating back to the early 1940s, Silicon Valley was quite happy to avoid the US government unless it was handing out lucrative contracts. And the feds were seemingly fine with turning a blind eye; the less the government knew about what tech companies were doing, the fewer legal and legislative issues they would have to address. But in the mid 1990s, a group of technology heavyweights led by Cisco CEO John Chambers and investor John Doerr realized that technology would permeate every aspect of business, education, and consumers' lives. And they needed the help of the US government if they were to have the kind of impact they envisioned. Even then, Chambers, Doerr, and key leaders from Intel and other tech companies saw the benefits of mobile, connected cities, and IoT. They lobbied the Clinton administration and governmental agencies under him to help officials understand tech and its eventual role in our country. To Clinton's credit, he and Vice President Al Gore opened a lot of doors to the tech industry in Washington. When George W. Bush became president, he created a special non-partisan tech advisory council, at the urging of Chambers, Doerr and Michael Dell. I was invited to join that council and our first meeting with President Bush was very promising. He seemed to understand how important technology would be for the future of the US, and I know he spent many hours with tech leaders before the election to get a grasp on their vision. But five months after our first tech council meeting at the White House, the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks shook the nation. The Bush administration's focus shifted to fighting terrorism and the tech council was put on the back burner and never revived. While key tech leaders tried to get their message heard in a broader way in Washington, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the fight against terrorism took up much of the White House's mindshare. Any real focus to help expand a tech agenda during Bush's years in office was minimal. //Related Articles Are You Ready to Share the Road With Driverless 'Ghost' Cars? When President Obama entered the White House, many of these same tech leaders along with new and younger tech visionaries pushed him and his administration to become more focused on the role of tech at all levels of business. He and his administration have done so and made an effort to understand things like the maker movement, the IoT and its role in cities, and issues related to telecom spectrum. During his presidency, we have seen the Internet and the cloud become a core asset within government, business, education, and consumer programs. But we are now at another presidential transition point and, given the recent advancements in tech, whoever is elected president or to serve in Congress needs to be more tech-savvy than ever. During his keynote at Intel's Developer Forum this week, CEO Brian Krzanich invited Jeffrey Immelt, the CEO of GE, to the stage to talk about the various things GE is doing to make cities more intelligent. He also had an executive from BMW share its vision for autonomous vehicles. Both emphasized the role legislators will play in the success of these programs. For smart cities and smart cars to succeed, laws will need to be changed or written to make it possible for autonomous cars to drive safely within city limits. Lawmakers will have to approve the placement of new sensors and smart cameras to enhance accident avoidance. State officials will have to understand how technology will impact every corner as gadgets are added to streets, light poles, and intersections. Unless our elected officials understand this, they will only slow down the expansion.

PRLog XHome Login Latest News News By Location News By Industry News By Topic News By Date Business Profiles Pressrooms Get Feeds Get Alerted For Bloggers PRNewswire Distribution Search DBS IT Australia Weighs in on Australia's Cyber Security Skills Shortage Perth-based custom software development company DBS IT Australia has recently responded to a report revealing that Australia is feeling the lack of professionals working in cyber security more acutely than other countries.   Spread the Word: News By Tag: * It Support * It Support Services By Industry: * TechnologyPERTH, Australia - Oct. 4, 2016 - PRLog -- Custom software development company DBS IT Australia has recently responded to a report revealing that Australia is feeling the lack of professionals working in cyber security more acutely than other countries. The Centre for Strategic and International Studies performed a survey which was commissioned by Intel Security, and it revealed that 88% of decision makers in Australian IT agree that there's a shortage of people with skills in cyber security both within Australia and in their individual organisations. The report, Hacking the Skills Shortage is a study of the shortage in cybersecurity skills internationally, and IT decision makers from the United Kingdom, France, Israel, the United States, Germany, Japan, Australia and Mexico answered a number of questions about cybersecurity. Respondents across all countries surveyed said that education in cybersecurity was deficient. 82% of those surveyed reported a shortage of skills, and 76% said they believe that their government isn't investing enough money in cybersecurity talent. DBS IT Australia recently weighed in on the results, and a spokesperson for the company had this to say: "It seems that almost every day we read about another company that has been hacked, and attacks are outpacing defence- largely due to the lack of cybersecurity skills both in Australia and internationally. This shortfall means that many companies have a critical vulnerability since current education and policies are failing to meet the demand for these skills. At DBS IT, we're committed to providing secure software solutions to prevent hacking and ensure that businesses across all sectors in Australia can keep their data safe and confidential." The most frequent skills currently in demand include secure software development, intrusion detection, and attack mitigation. Interestingly, 97% of those surveyed said that their organisation's board of directors are now viewing cybersecurity as important. This is a huge change, as just five years ago cybersecurity was not even considered to be in the top 10 risks that boards were prioritising. It doesn't look like the workforce shortage for cybersecurity will be abating anytime soon, and respondents estimated that on average, 15% of cybersecurity positions would be unfilled by 2020, with Australian respondents estimating this number at 17%. This skill shortage is risky for organisations, and many companies say that this gap in the workforce has already caused them to incur damages. Many businesses have been targeted by hackers, with 25% of respondents saying that their companies have lost propriety data due to this gap in cybersecurity skills, and 22% saying that they've suffered reputational damage. What does this mean for businesses in Australia that need to keep data safe? The DBS IT spokesperson says it's not all bad news: "While it's definitely a problem that Australia (and many other countries around the world) are facing such a skills shortage in cybersecurity, many are choosing to outsource these tasks instead of hiring dedicated specialists to work in-house. At DBS IT, we work with many different companies, providing software development, cyber security and IT management and we can help businesses both large and small protect their data."

Image: Aslysun/Shutterstock As well as two new smartphones, Google’s foray into the virtual reality (VR) world will continue with the launch of a new Daydream VR headset ‘Made by Google’ at a big reveal tonight. Google is stepping up its move into hardware with a holistic approach and more prominent branding. At a 10/4 (4 October) event today, Google is expected to reveal a slew of new hardware. Unfortunately for Google, the surprise has been marred by UK retailer Carphone Warehouse as well as Canadian stores Bell and Telus, who have already leaked the specs and renders of the new Google Pixel and Pixel XL branded smartphones, manufactured by HTC. But the latest nugget of knowledge to emerge could possibly feature an Irish connection. As well as the new smartphones, Google is expected to take the wraps off its new Daydream VR headset, which will retail for around $79. Earlier this year, we reported that Irish tech company Movidius – which was recently acquired by Intel for around $300m – signed a major deal to work on future hardware with the internet giant. It was also reported that Movidius was at the heart of Google’s plans to create a revolutionary stand-alone VR headset. The headset won’t need to be tethered to a smartphone, games console or PC to function. It could include a screen, high-powered processors and outward facing cameras using chips from Movidius, to use the camera’s feed to track the motion of the user’s head. Could Daydream VR be the same headset? It is hard to say at this point, but according to Hollywood news bible Variety, the headset will be compatible with either of the two Pixel smartphones; so it is possible that Google may still be hard at work on a stand-alone headset. Variety reported that Daydream-optimised smartphones automatically switch into VR mode when inserted into a Daydream headset. Daydream will also ship with a handheld controller similar to a Wii remote to enable navigation and game play. Made by Google According to other reports, Google is understood to be marketing the entire launch under the ‘Made by Google’ name, even though HTC is the manufacturing partner. Interestingly, HTC has manufactured its own fully fledged VR headset called the Vive. The Daydream headsets’ operating system is understood to be an extension of Android. The launch of the Pixel smartphones could see Google jettison the Nexus brand altogether. Both the Pixel and the Pixel XL smartphones will also be running the latest version of Android Nougat, which comes with support for the Daydream VR platform.

The effort to build the Thirty Meter Telescope has been held up by Hawaiians who consider it an eyesore on Mauna Kea, a beloved dormant volcano. [Thirty Meter Telescope via New York Times] MAUNA KEA, Hawaii — Little lives up here except whispering hopes and a little bug called Wekiu.

A few minutes in the sun will fry your skin. Brains and fingers go numb. At night, the stars are so close they seem tangled in your hair. Two years ago, this mountaintop was the scene of a cosmic traffic jam: honking horns, vans and trucks full of astronomers, VIPs, journalists, businesspeople, politicians, protesters and police — all snarled at a roadblock just short of the summit. Abandoning their cars, some of the visitors started to hike up the hill toward what would have been a groundbreaking for the biggest and most expensive stargazing machinery ever built in the Northern Hemisphere: the Thirty Meter Telescope, 14 years and $1.4 billion in the making. They were assembling on a plateau just below the summit, when Joshua Mangauil, better known by his Hawaiian name of Lanakila, then 27, barged onto the scene. Resplendent in a tapa cloth, beads, a red loin cloth, his jet black hair in a long Mohawk, he had hiked over the volcano's cinder cones barefoot. "Like snakes you are. Vile snakes," he yelled. "We gave all of our aloha to you guys, and you slithered past us like snakes." "For what? For your greed to look into the sky? You guys can't take care of this place." No ground was broken that day or since. To astronomers, the Thirty Meter Telescope would be a next-generation tool to spy on planets around other stars or to peer into the cores of ancient galaxies, with an eye sharper and more powerful than the Hubble Space Telescope, another landmark in humanity's quest to understand its origins. But to its opponents, the telescope would be yet another eyesore despoiling an ancient sacred landscape, a gigantic 18-story colossus joining the 13 telescopes already on Mauna Kea. Later this month, proponents and opponents of the giant telescope will face off in a hotel room in the nearby city of Hilo for the start of hearings that will lead to a decision on whether the telescope can be legally erected on the mountain. Over the years, some have portrayed this fight as a struggle between superstition and science. Others view the telescope as another symbol of how Hawaiians have been unfairly treated since Congress annexed the islands — illegally in the eyes of many — in 1898. And still others believe it will bring technology and economic development to an impoverished island. "This is a very simple case about land use," said Kealoha Pisciotta, a former telescope operator on Mauna Kea who has been one of the leaders of a group fighting telescope development on the mountain for the last decade. "It's not science versus religion. We're not the church. You're not Galileo." Hanging in the balance is perhaps the best stargazing site on Earth. "Mauna Kea is the flagship of American and international astronomy," said Doug Simons, the director of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope on Mauna Kea. "We are on the precipice of losing this cornerstone of U.S. prestige." Big glass dreams The road to the stars once ended in California at Palomar Mountain, whose 200-inch-diameter telescope was long considered the size limit. The bigger a telescope mirror is, the more light it can capture and the fainter and farther it can see  out in space, back in time. In the 1990s, however, astronomers learned how to build telescopes with thin mirrors that relied on computer-adjusted supports to keep them from sagging or warping. There was an explosion of telescope building that has culminated, for now, in plans for three giant billion-dollar telescopes: the European Extremely Large Telescope and the Giant Magellan, both in Chile, and the Thirty Meter Telescope. Not only would they have a Brobdingnagian appetite for light, but they are designed to incorporate a new technology called adaptive optics, which can take the twinkle out of starlight by adjusting telescope mirrors to compensate for atmospheric turbulence. Richard Ellis, a British astronomer now at the European Southern Observatory in Garching, Germany, recalled being optimistic in 1999 when he arrived at the California Institute of Technology to begin developing what became known as the Thirty Meter Telescope. "The stock market was booming," he said. "Everything seemed possible." Canada, India and Japan eventually joined the project, now officially known as the TMT International Observatory. It has been helped along by the Betty and Gordon Moore Foundation, formed by the founder of Intel, which has contributed advice and $180 million. The telescope, originally scheduled to be completed by 2024, is modeled on the revolutionary 10-meter-diameter Keck telescopes that Caltech and the University of California operate on Mauna Kea. Like them, it will have a segmented mirror composed of small, hexagonal pieces of glass fitted together into an expanse wider than a tennis court. There are only a few places on Earth that are dark, dry and calm enough to be fit for a billion-dollar telescope. Rising 33,000 feet from the seafloor, Mauna Kea is the second biggest mountain in the solar system — only Olympus Mons on Mars is greater. The dormant ancient volcano has been the center of Polynesian culture — the umbilical cord connecting Earth and sky — seemingly forever. The mountain is part of so-called "ceded lands" that originally belonged to the Hawaiian Kingdom and are now administered by the state for the benefit of Hawaiians. On its spare, merciless summit, craters and cinder cones of indefinable age keep company with a variety pack of architectural shapes housing telescopes. In 1968 the University of Hawaii took out a 65-year lease on 11,000 acres for a dollar a year. Some 500 acres of that are designated as a science preserve. It includes the ice age quarry from which stone tools were being cut a thousand years ago, and hundreds of shrines and burial grounds. The first telescope went up in 1970. Many rapidly followed. Places like Mauna Kea are "cradles of knowledge," said Natalie Batalha, one of the leaders of NASA's Kepler planet-hunting mission. "I am filled with reverence and humility every time I get to be physically present at a mountaintop observatory." But some Hawaiians worried that knowledge was coming at too great a cost. "All those telescopes got put up with no thought beyond reviving the Hilo economy," said Michael Bolte, an astronomer from the University of California at Santa Cruz, who serves on the TMT board. "Not a lot of thought was given to culture issues." Some native Hawaiians complained that their beloved mountain had grown "pimples," and that the telescope development had interfered with cultural and religious practices that are protected by state law. Construction trash sometimes rolled down the mountain, said Nelson Ho, a photographer and Sierra Club leader who complained to the university. "They wouldn't listen," he said. "They just kept playing king of the mountain." An audit by the state of Hawaii in 1998 scolded the university for failing to protect the mountain and its natural and cultural resources. An environmental impact study performed by NASA in 2007 similarly concluded that 30 years of astronomy had caused "significant, substantial and adverse" harm to Mauna Kea. A step back for NASA The tide began to shift in 2001 when NASA announced a plan to add six small telescopes called outriggers to the Keck complex. The outriggers would be used in concert with the big telescopes as interferometers to test ideas a for a future space mission dedicated to looking for planets around other stars. Pisciotta led a band of environmentalists and cultural practitioners who went to court to stop NASA. The group included the Hawaiian chapter of the Sierra Club and the Royal Order of Kamehameha, devoted to restoring the Kingdom of Hawaii. Pisciotta said she had once dreamed of being a cosmologist but lacked the requisite math skills and instead took a night job operating a radio telescope on Mauna Kea. She became disenchanted when a family shrine disappeared from the summit and the plans for the outriggers impinged on a cinder cone. "Cinder cones are burial sites. It's time to not let this go on," she said. The group prepared for court by reading popular books about trials. In 2007, Hawaii's third district court found the management plan for the outriggers was flawed and revoked the building permit. "NASA packed up and left," Pisciotta said. Encountering aloha The prospective builders of the TMT knew they had their work cut out for them. In 2007, the Moore Foundation hired Peter Adler, a consultant and sociologist, to look into the consequences of putting the telescope in Hawaii. "Should TMT decide to pursue a Mauna Kea site," his report warned, "it will inherit the anger, fear and great mistrust generated through previous telescope planning and siting failures and an accumulated disbelief that any additional projects, especially a physically imposing one like the TMT, can be done properly." The astronomers picked a telescope site that was less anthropologically sensitive, on a plateau below the summit with no monuments or other obvious structures on it. They agreed to pay $1 million a year, a fifth of which would go to the state's Office of Hawaiian Affairs and the rest to stewardship of the mountain. Quietly, they also pledged another $2 million a year toward science and technology education and workforce development on the island of Hawaii. The Moore Foundation also put some $2 million into the Imiloa Astronomy Center, a museum and planetarium run by the University of Hawaii. Bolte, a mild-mannered UCSC professor with a soothing lilt to his voice, became one of the most visible promoters of the project in community meetings. He recalled going to a meeting in Hilo once where tensions were very high. Afterward, he said, he was afraid to go out to his car. Sure enough, a crowd rushed him when he got there. "What kind of astronomy do you do?" they asked eagerly. "The aloha spirit really exists," Bolte said. "Exploring the universe is a wonderful thing humans do," he added. Nevertheless, "there was a core we never won over." "In retrospect, we might have underestimated the strength of the sovereignty movement." The Hawaiian Renaissance In the years since the first telescopes went up on Mauna Kea, Hawaiian people and culture had experienced a resurgence of pride known as the Hawaiian Renaissance. In 1976, a band of Hawaiians sailed the outrigger canoe Hokulea from Hawaii to Tahiti. The feat showed how ancient Polynesians could have purposefully explored and colonized the Pacific, navigating the seas using only the sun, stars, ocean swells and wind. "And that was the first spark of shutting up everybody who said that we were inferior, that we were not intelligent," said Mangauil, the protester. In 1978, the state recognized Hawaiian, which once had been banned from schools, as an official language. With rising pride came — at least among some more vocal native Hawaiians — questions about whether the occupation and annexation of Hawaii by the United States in the 1890s was legal. Telescopes on a sacred mountain constitute a form of "colonial violence," in the words of J. Kehaulani Kauanui, an anthropologist at Wesleyan University. Or as Robert Kirshner, a Harvard professor who is now also chief science adviser to the Moore Foundation, put it, "The question in that case become not so much whether you did the environmental impact statement right, but whose island is it?" Having cut their teeth fighting the outrigger project, Pisciotta's group, known informally as the Mauna Kea Hui, was prepared when the TMT Corp. formally selected the mountain for its site in 2009. Many Hawaiians welcomed the telescope project. At a permit hearing, Wallace Ishibashi Jr., whose family had an ancestral connection to Mauna Kea, compared the Thirty Meter's mission to the search for aumakua, the ancestral origins of the universe. "Hawaiians," he said, "have always been a creative and adaptive people." But Pisciotta and her friends argued among other things that an 18-story observatory, which would be the biggest structure on the whole island of Hawaii, did not fit in a conservation district. In a series of hearings in 2010 and 2011, the state land board approved a permit for the telescope but then stipulated that no construction could begin until a so-called contested case hearing, in which interested parties could present their arguments, was held. The walk of fame The state won that hearing, and a groundbreaking ceremony was scheduled for Oct. 7, 2014. The groundbreaking was never intended to be a public event, said Bob McClaren, associate director of the University of Hawaii's Institute for Astronomy, which is responsible for scientific activities on the mountain. "I thought it was reasonable to restrict access to those who were invited," he said. Mangauil, who makes his living teaching hula dancing and Hawaiian culture, said later that he had wanted only to make the astronomers feel uncomfortable to be on the mountain and to get protesters' signs in view of the television cameras. In an interview, he said he had nothing against science or astronomy, but did not want it on his mountain. "Our connection to the mountain is like, that's our elder, the mother of our resources," he said. "We're talking about the wau akua, the realm of where the gods live." There are no shrines on the very summit, he pointed out, which should be a lesson: Not even the most holy people are supposed to go there. Unable to get to the groundbreaking, the Hawaiians formed their own blockade. Tempers flared. "We were seeing the native Hawaiian movement flexing its muscles," Bolte said. Seeing people hiking up the mountain past the port-o-potties, Mangauil stormed after them and wound up on the hood of a ranger truck, even more angry. Guarding the Mountain Lanakila's barefoot run set the tone for two years of unrest and demonstrations. Protesters calling themselves Guardians of the Mountain set up a permanent vigil across the road from the Mauna Kea visitor center, stopping telescope construction crews and equipment from going up. Dozens were arrested. Gov. David Ige has tried to appease both sides. While saying that "we have in many ways failed the mountain," he said the Thirty Meter Telescope should go forward, but at least three other telescopes would have to come down. Astronomers and business leaders grew frustrated that the state was not doing enough to keep the road open for construction trucks and workers. "The result of the faulty law enforcement surrounding Mauna Kea is fostering tension, aggression, racism and business uncertainty," business organizations and the Hawaii Chamber of Commerce wrote to the governor. "Ambiguity surrounding the rule of law has prompted a poor economic climate." Stopping trucks on the steep slope was dangerous, said Bolte, adding that "people were basically trapped at the summit." Simons, the Canada-France-Hawaii director, grew increasingly worried about the effect of the protests on the astronomers, who became reluctant to be identified as observatory staffers. "It really tugged at us to see the staff going from being proud to scared in a matter of weeks," he said. Meanwhile Pisciotta's coalition was plugging through the courts. On Dec. 2, the Hawaiian Supreme Court revoked the telescope building permit, ruling that the state had violated due process by handing out the permit before the contested case hearing. "Quite simply, the Board put the cart before the horse when it issued the permit," the court wrote. Game of Domes By mid December, Clarence Ching, another member of the opposition, stood in a crowd with other Hawaiians and watched trucks carrying equipment retreat from the mountain. "David had beaten Goliath," he said. "We were even happy and sad at the same time — sad, for instance, that somebody had to lose — as we had fought hard and long." The court's decision set the stage for a new round of hearings, now scheduled to start in mid October. The case, presided over by Riki May Amano, a retired judge appointed by the Land Board, is likely to last longer than the first round, which consumed seven days of hearings over a few weeks, partly because there are more parties this time around. Among them is the pro-telescope Hawaiian group called Perpetuating Unique Educational Opportunities or PUEO, who contend the benefits of the TMT to the community have been undersold. Whoever wins this fall's contested case hearing, the decision is sure to be quickly appealed to the Hawaiian Supreme Court. In an interview, Edward Stone, a Caltech professor and vice president of the Thirty Meter Telescope International Observatory, the group that will build the telescope, set April 2018 as the deadline for beginning construction. Depending on how it goes in Hawaii or elsewhere, the telescope could be ready sometime in the last half of the next decade. "We need to start building this thing somewhere," he said. "We still hope Hawaii will work," he added. "What we need is a timely permit, and we need access to the mountain once we have a permit." But there is no guarantee that even if the astronomers succeed in court they will prevail on the mountain. In an email exchange, J. Douglas Ing, lawyer for the MMT Observatory, said they were "cautiously optimistic" that local agencies would uphold the law, but the astronomers have also been investigating alternative sites in Mexico, Chile, India, China and the Canary Islands. "It's wise of the TMT to be exploring other sites," said Richard Wurdeman, the lawyer for the Mauna Kea Hui. When Pisciotta is asked what would happen if the giant telescope finally wins, she said: "It would be really hard for Hawaiian people to swallow that. It's always been our way to lift our prayers up to heaven and hope they hear us." Bolte said he had learned to not make predictions about Hawaii. In a recent email, he recalled photographing a bunch of short-eared Hawaiian owls. "These are called pueo, and they are said to be the physical form of ancestor spirits," Bolte recounted. Referring to the Hawaiian term for a wise elder, he said, "I had one kupuna tell me it was a great sign for TMT that so many pueo sought me out that trip, and another tell me it was a sign that we should leave the island immediately before a calamity falls on TMT."

By Corazon Victorino On 10/03/16 AT 11:16 PM Close Apple’s upcoming iMac may have just been leaked by Best Buy. The Richfield, Minnesota consumer electronics corporation reportedly published a page featuring a new 27-inch iMac over the weekend. According to Business Insider, the 27-inch iMac that briefly made an appearance on Best Buy’s website was not only listed as “New!” it was also revealed to be sporting Intel’s Kaby Lake Core i7 chip. With the model code K0SC0LL/A, the iMac was listed as having Retina 5K display, 32GB memory and 2TB Fusion drive.  The listing also mentioned the special features of the iMac including built-in wireless networking, a webcam and wireless keyboard and mouse. The leaked all-in-one Apple desktop computer was also revealed to be valued at $3,199.99. Though Business Insider noted that this could just be a mistake or a placeholder made by a Best Buy employee, the timing of this leak strongly suggests that the Cupertino giant is looking to refresh its Mac devices, especially its highly anticipated MacBook Pro. Related Stories Apple To Release Three New iPad Pros In Spring 2017 iPhone 6s Plus Explodes; Class Action Suits Filed Against Apple iPhone 7 Is Coming To South Korea — Should Samsung Be Worried? Meanwhile, AppleInsider claims there are a lot of inconsistencies present in the leaked entry for the 27-inch iMac. The Apple-centric site says the current iMac model with i7 processor, 23GB of RAM and 2TB Fusion drive costs $3,150, which is only $50 less than the leaked iMac’s price.  In addition, AppleInsider states that there is no sign that Intel’s seventh generation Kaby Lake quad-core processors are currently shipping as of this time. Hence, it is uncertain whether the 27-inch Retina 5K iMac could be housing this type of processor.  Another indication that seems suspicious according to Apple Insider is the model number of the leaked iMac. It is listed as K0SC0LL/A, and this does not conform to the model nomenclature of existing iMac devices, such as MK462, MK472 and MK482.  The leak comes more than a week after a sketchy rumor surfaced claiming that Apple is announcing its revamped MacBook Pro during a keynote presentation that is scheduled to happen on Oct. 24. Apple has yet to deny or confirm the rumor as of late, and it also isn't clear if the Cupertino giant will be launching the new MacBook Pro alongside the rumored iMac refresh.

Well the first high school competition happened in NZ and it was a success.  The event was called "Point and Click" and it was an eSports competition where secondary school teams in Auckland battled it out to see who was the best at League of Legends.  Over 230 players from 46 teams participated in a 5v5 battle of League of Legends. The event was held on September 29th and September 30th during the school holidays at AMES IT. The Grand Final took place NZGC's Hexedome in Parnell which is the country's first eSports venue.  I actually got to see some of the action unfold myself and the competition was a laid back, but competitive affair. Many of the competitors were fed a lot of pizza during the event. Sadly my old high school of Mount Roskill Grammar got beaten pretty early in the competition.  The winning team/school of the tournament was Freetyler1 from Auckland Grammar. They beat out Evy Will Carry from Macleans College to win a cool prize of $3000. They also got a few prizes from the sponsors that made the event possible in the first place.  Freetyler1 will have to play in the NZGC grand final against Manurewa High School on October 12th. You can check out the action yourself via Twitch by clicking here.   Marketing Manager of AMES- The Institute of IT, Nabeel Dada, is delighted by the support of the event. “Our vision for Point & Click is to become the largest nationwide Secondary school eSPORTS Competition.  We want to educate and support all attendees and high school students who are technically literate and enjoy following hardware and software trends in their passion for technology.”  “Huge thanks to our sponsors Playtech, MightyApe, Plantronics and Corsair and our affiliate sponsors Intel, Logitech and Viewsonic, for adding credibility to the event; also a huge thank you to Letsplay.live for streaming the two days across their Twitch channel and hosting the final at the HEXADOME.” concluded Dada.  We can be sure that similar competitions will be held in the near future. If you want to be a pro gamer, just keep practising and maybe you can be good enough to compete and win some great prizes.    Want to know more on this topic?

Randal Riebe Share Tweet Email Are your customers’ and prospects’ expectations vastly different than what they were just a few years ago? Are they asking you to respond faster and at almost any time of day? Across almost all industries the answer is a resounding yes. Today’s customers have been shaped by digital information made possible by mobile, social, and cloud technologies that impacts both personal and business purchasing decisions. A recent report entitled Mastering Omni-Channel B2B Customer Engagement from Forrester Consulting indicated that 98 percent of global business buyers do some online research on work related purchases. We are not talking about the impact of BYOD in the workplace, but the changes in human behavior that drive their expectations of suppliers and partners. A quick story to set the stage: In 2011 Blaine Hurst, EVP, chief transformation and growth officer, joined Panera Bread to focus on the reinvention of the customer experience. Although the company had not made any major investments in technology for many years, Hurst saw the changes in the consumer adoption of mobile technology and recognized the opportunity to position Panera Bread as a customer experience leader through digital innovation. In 2014, they launched Panera 2.0, which involved integrating a variety of technologies that created a platform for personalized service, including a better way to order, pay, and receive food. The customer response? Panera Bread is now processing 130,000 to 150,000 customer transactions daily across the platform in the 500 bakery/café locations in North America that they have online, substantially exceeding their early predictions. They have also seen a significant increase in the frequency of returning guests, with more than 17 million active customers in their loyalty program. Additionally, they are receiving about 200,000 email survey responses each month from loyalty customers, which are providing great insight into their customers’ desires. Since the deployment of the platform, they have seen growth in both transactions and revenue in the updated locations. Realizing that Panera Bread is a B2C business, and most of us are B2B businesses, you may wonder why this is relevant to you. The reality is that customer expectations today are no longer based on industry boundaries but rather a best-of-breed experience across B2B and B2C. So what is different about today’s customers? They’re more informed—unfortunately, often more informed than the sales representative they’re speaking too. They use technology tools to quickly research a product, learn about competitive versions, and determine the lowest available price. They use social media to learn about others’ experience with the product, and they read user reviews. They compare customer experiences that encompass a company’s brand, websites, response time to inquiries, quality of customer service, and post-purchase support. And they expect you to tailor your services to their needs, and to deliver what they want, when and where they want it. The days of a linear sales process are long gone. Today’s sales process has become more fluid and collaborative, with the customer often leading the conversation. It’s no longer about the products’ features and benefits, but about listening, understanding the customers’ intent, and then helping them achieve it. So what’s a company to do? A big first step is to start looking at your business through the eyes of your customers and that begins with truly understanding who your customer is. A simple place to start is a daily review within your company of customer requests and questions. Identify those with a major problem or a unique request, and assign the appropriate person or team to respond or resolve. Refer back to previous problems to observe any recurring issues or requests. Review customer touch points within your organization—sales, marketing, account management, and customer support. Understand how customers and prospects communicate with you—phone, email, snail mail, chat, IM, video, social media messaging, or texting. Begin to transform the business and operational models away from the mentality of making things easier on your own company, rather than easier for the customers. Look at how your customers prefer to do business, and prioritize your effort to quickly align with them. Like Panera Bread, invest in a technology platform that is designed for customer-centricity. Prioritize the development of personalization capabilities both online and in person. Deliver a B2C-like personalized experience to your customers—before someone else does. Get Social There are many well-known B2B brands that have heavily invested in social media as a part of their strategy to effectively meet their customers’ expectations. Intel views it as the new model to engage with customers and colleagues participating in LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Glassdoor, and their YouTube Channel. Intel places high value on reaching their audience no matter where in the world or what type of technology platform they are using. IBM is another recognizable name that has been involved with social media for many years. Like several companies, they not only utilize social as a key component of their strategy, but offer products and services to guide other companies to get closer with their customers. Raytheon utilizes social media to deliver the latest company news and encourage engagement in discussions with the company. Each of these companies is focused on creating richer customer experiences, gaining more customer insight, and increasing brand loyalty to satisfy expectations of today’s customer. —R.R.   R.

Ubuntu 16.10 (Yakkety Yak) to Ship with an Optional Unity 8 Session After All GO The distro is now powered by the final Linux 4.8 kernel Oct 5, 2016 21:00 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  We told you earlier this year, in summer, that we were switching to use Ubuntu 16.10 (Yakkety Yak) on some of our computers to monitor its development cycle and inform you guys about the new features it gets. Now that the Final Beta is out, Canonical's engineers working on the Ubuntu Desktop and Unity user interface are preparing for the final launch of Ubuntu 16.10, which will happen next week, on October 13, 2016. And, if you remember, Canonical promised that it would deliver the next-gen Unity 8 interface as an optional session. It didn't make it into the Final Beta pre-release, but earlier today, the packages needed to enable the optional Unity 8 session in the login manager have been pushed to the stable repositories, so you'll get them automatically if you're running Ubuntu 16.10 just by doing a normal update. The kernel packages have been updated as well today, based on the final release of the Linux 4.8 kernel, which means that Ubuntu 16.10 (Yakkety Yak) is going to be the first stable GNU/Linux distribution to be powered by Linux kernel 4.8. Back to Unity 8, after the update, you'll be able to select it from the display manager (see the screenshot below for details). Unity 8 is currently an experimental session However, don't get all that excited, because the Unity 8 session, which runs on top of the Mir display server designed by Canonical's engineers specifically for mobile devices, such as Ubuntu Phones and Ubuntu Tablets, is currently in an experimental state for desktops. It won't work in a virtual machine like VirtualBox in case you just want to see what the fuss is all about, but with some workarounds, it may work in a KVM/QEMU or VMware virtualization environment, according to Michael Hall from Canonical. Locally, Unity 8 and Mir are currently designed to support only Intel HD graphics cards. But it doesn't work on our testing machines, which feature Intel HD video cards and dedicated AMD Radeon GPUs. Currently, we only see a black screen when attempting to access the Unity 8 session, and have no control over it whatsoever. It works on a VMware virtual machine, but you should not expect too much. The experimental Unity 8 session in Ubuntu 16.10 is just that, an experiment, which means that it's here for you to try and report bugs if it doesn't work on your computer. Also, only a few applications are available, so you'll have a better experience if you have a convergent Ubuntu Phone or Tablet. In conclusion, your wish was granted, Ubuntu 16.10 (Yakkety Yak) is shipping with an optional Unity 8 session, but after five minutes of test driving it, you'll quickly log out and log back into your good old Unity 7 desktop, or whatever you're happy with these days. Probably the most awesome feature of Ubuntu 16.10 is the Linux 4.8 kernel.

Radio Sputnik’s Loud & Clear spoke with whistleblower William Binney on whether the agency has a second Edward Snowden on its hands. In recent months, the US National Security Agency claimed it had been hit by a series of a cyberattacks. Without providing any evidence, Washington resorted to the familiar tactic of blaming the hacks on Russia. But William Binney, a whistleblower who left the NSA in 2001, always doubted this narrative, believing the evidence instead showed signs that an agency insider was responsible for the leaks.  "It appeared to me that because of the nature of the NSA network [that] it’s almost impossible to hack in. At least I don’t see how they could do it," Binney told Loud & Clear’s Brian Becker. "So I assumed immediately that it was an insider." © AP Photo/ Second Snowden? Feds Arrest NSA Contractor For Stealing Classified Data It now seems he was proven correct, with the US Department of Justice confirming that 51-year-old contractor Harold Thomas Martin was arrested on suspicion of stealing highly classified source codes from the agency. Those source codes allow the agency to pierce through weaknesses in private firewalls and spy on computer networks. While the NSA could help secure these vulnerabilities, doing so would put its own spying efforts at risk. "The reason they have allowed these weaknesses to exist is one of the reasons why the OPM [US Office of Personnel Management] got hacked, [and] why you read about other hacks in the US," Binney says. "They’re not fixing the problems, and when you don’t fix the problems you’re leaving everybody vulnerable and exposed. © Sputnik/ 'Corrupt' US Intel Unable to Prevent Terrorism, NSA Whistleblower Tells Sputnik "They don’t fix it because they then have this window that they don’t want to close so they can look through…and see what people are doing." The agency also cites these known cybersecurity weaknesses as an excuse to receive more federal funding. "If you’re beating the drums of cybersecurity and you really want to do it, you fix the problems you know about. They don’t do that, [but] they leverage the weaknesses and the fact that people get hacked to drum up more support for more money," he says. "It’s another way of fleecing the US public of money." © Flickr/ Tom Blackwell New Snowden Leak: NSA’s 'Collect All the Signals' Spy Strategy Started in the UK Given the wide reach of the NSA, Martin’s arrest raises doubt about other recent US "hacks," such as the leak of internal DNC emails earlier this year. "It doesn’t have to be someone hacking in, it could be somebody like the NSA that already has all of their emails," Binney explains. Ultimately, baseless accusations against the Russian government for internal leaks serves to feed the US military-industrial complex. "People have an interest to create, for example, a Cold War with the Russians," he says. "What that means is more trillions of dollars invested in the Defense Department and military-industrial complex and the intelligence complex." However Martin’s trial turns out, Binney doesn’t have much faith in America’s ability to treat its whistleblowers like Martin or Edward Snowden fairly. © Photo: Pixabay Hackers Claim to Sell NSA Cyber-Weapons in Online Auction "If you try to raise the issues internally with the government, like I did and others, they attack you. They try to put you in jail, they fabricate evidence against you. It’s really a criminal government we have now," Binney says. "Until we get a government that’s going to be honest and democratic and follow the principles of the Constitution, there’s no way [Snowden] can come back." After revealing the extent of the United States’ domestic surveillance apparatus in 2013, Snowden currently lives in exile in Moscow, where he was granted asylum by the Russian government. ...

Page 1 of 2. 34 Comments With this month's Ubuntu 16.10 "Yakkety Yak" release, Unity 7 on the X.Org Server is used by default on the desktop while an alternate Unity 8 + Mir session is installed by default, but while it's available is not used unless logging into this newer desktop stack. Here's my few minutes of trying it out this morning with all of the latest Ubuntu 16.10 packages. I hadn't tried out the experimental Unity 8 session on an Ubuntu desktop in quite a number of months. When logging into this Unity 8 session today with what's installed by default, it's quite bare. Only the system settings and Ubuntu web browser are prominently available. But when firing up the Ubuntu Web Browser, not only was it slow, but it wasn't rendering pages correctly. This brief Unity 8 testing was done on an Intel Core i5 Skylake system making use of the HD Graphics on the default Ubuntu 16.10 driver stack. Various scopes are available, such as Yahoo Finance and Reddit. I kept trying to find the Ubuntu Terminal for Unity 8, but had no such luck. The ubuntu-terminal-app was installed on the system, but not showing up in the menu. To make matters worse, when switching to a VT to get command-line access, I wasn't able to switch back into the Unity 8 session as it would just appear as a black screen. The scopes can easily take over the entire screen or windowed with the desktop mode on Unity 8.

An online resource called STEM Superstars Guide has been launched that can be accessed by scouts across the country to get information about STEM careers. Volunteers can also use this resource to find out what activities they can participate in and ideas that they can use to spark relevant conversations. The aim of this partnership is to encourage more young girls to pursue careers in STEM fields. It’s said that 50 percent of young women decide against pursuing a career in STEM even though they show an early interest in these fields. The aim is to change that and connect young girls with female role models so that they can be inspired by them and set out to achieve great things. Netflix also hosted troops from Silicon Valley at its headquarters yesterday where scouts were able to interact with female representatives from major tech companies such as Intel, Google, Instagram, and Twitter.

ABI Research forecasts the enterprise segment of the Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) market will cross $1 billion this year as the industry sets its sight on bridging the security gap between employee authentication and corporate system security. Logo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151014/276887LOGO "Enterprises are finally realizing that they should not view MFA as a luxury security technology, one only for IT personnel, managers, and C-Level executives," says Dimitrios Pavlakis, Industry Analyst at ABI Research. "With the BYOD culture in enterprises, it is becoming a necessity for businesses to deploy newer authentication technologies to fight detection-resistant malware, phishing attacks, credential theft, rootkit deployments, cross site scripting, and other threats." While promising authentication technologies, like geo-location, biometrics, tamper-resistant password tokens, device ID, and application credential management, are increasingly brought into the spotlight to fight cyberattacks in corporate settings, the ecosystem is evolving. The landscape now incorporates newly developed algorithms for dynamic authentication, probability heuristics, single-sign-on (SSO), and user devices as part of a unified MFA umbrella. "The employee-praised BYOD culture is finally meeting the challenges of modern MFA in the workplace," concludes Pavlakis. "Ensuring workplace authentication while taking into account device mobility, protection from cyber threats, insecure employee practices, and the desire to implement SSO on a wider scale, are just some challenges that enterprises now face." To help businesses proactively circumvent and counter cyber threats, software and hardware vendors are intensifying their efforts to address employee mobility issues, sharpening security for their products, and maintaining interoperability levels across devices, operating systems, and software platforms. Established companies like Centrify, Intel, RSA, Symantec, and Vasco, along with new promising entrants like Iovation, LaunchKey, and Yubico are active in this space.

Champion bodybuilder Damion Daniel and Team Manager Cecil Mitchell arrived in Curacao on Monday enroute to Grenada via Trinidad but will have to spend at least another day on the Dutch island off the South American coast. Tyrone James, the other Grenadian competitor, returned to Bermuda, where he resides, following the championship. “It’s very frustrating for us, especially Damion who has a special diet,” Mitchell told GrenadaSports. “It’s becoming an expensive and unnecessary stay with too many uncertainties.” Bodybuilding continues to be a sport on the rise in Grenada and our athletes are making their mark,… Click To Tweet The Grenadians were relieved when they boarded an Intel Air flight for Trinidad at 1:00 a.m. on Wednesday but shortly before landing at Piarco International Airport they were advised that the plane will be returning to Curacao. “We don’t know what are the problems but they (airline) said that there is a problem and we can’t land and returning to Curacao,” said Mitchell. “We have our suspicions since there are people in the same hotel who said they have been waiting for a flight to Trinidad since last Thursday. There is something more that the airline is not telling us.” Daniel won the heavyweight category while James copped the second position in the Men’s Physique Class which concluded early Sunday morning. Daniel, a constable in the Royal Grenada Police Force, is a member of the security detail of Prime Minister Dr Keith Mitchell. Share This Page: Tweet Like this: Like Loading...

Currently, copper bumping is extensively used in market owing to its advantages such as considerably low cost than other methods, high efficiency and compatibility with bond pads. Furthermore, impending need of circuit miniaturization, thriving portable devices industry and technological superiority over wire bond connections are major factors expected to propel the growth in global flip chip market. However, availability of less customization options as well as high capital investment requirements for setting up a new plant are the limitations that restrict the market growth. 2.5D IC packaging technology dominated the overall market in 2015 owing to its several advantages such as enhanced capacity, improved performance, and reduced system space requirements and low power consumption. 3D IC is expected to register highest CAGR as it is equipped with all the advantages of 2.5D IC as well as some additional advantages. In bumping technology segment, copper bumping held over 50% in the year 2015 due to its exclusive advantages of low cost, compatibility with bond pads and applications in technologies such as transceivers, embedded processors, application processors, power management, baseband, ASICs and SOCs. However, Tin-lead eutectic solder is expected to witness low growth rate due to government initiatives to ban toxic substances that have impacted its market heavily. Electronics industry contributed over 45% of the overall flip chip market in the year 2015. Imminent need of size reduction in electronics devices, requirement of higher data transmission speed and improvement in efficiency collectively thrust the replacement of wire bond with flip chips in electronics industry, hence making it dominant in the overall market. However, IT and telecommunication would be the fastest growing segment and is expected to register highest CAGR 12.3% during the forecast period. This is due to the increasing reach of telecommunication services in remote areas as well as introduction of new players in IT industry where flip chips are used in large scale in servers, host systems and data centers. Asia-pacific dominated the market in the year 2015 by accounting over 50% of the total market revenue and it is expected to maintain its dominance throughout the forecast period.

The BlackBerry senior VP for sales for its Mobility division Alex Thurber - stopping to talk to El Reg as he sailed through London on his honeymoon - also told us BlackBerry had interested potential licensees for its BB10 platform, and would consider licensing its keyboard know-how too. Last week BlackBerry announced that, with the Mobility Unit failing to meet its profitability target, the company was switching to licensing its software and brand instead, although it would produce at least two more BlackBerry-branded devices. It was no surprise, as Chen had speculated about licensing the brand in New York in July - but nobody noticed. (See BlackBerry chief: We don't have to make phones to make phones “If you listen to John Chen there, he says exactly what’s going to happen,” he noted. Thurber added that the hardened Android will qualify for NIAP certification, a set of security standards required for government use. “We will have a NIAP-certified Android next year,” Thurber confirmed. Typically only devices with secure containers have qualified, such as Samsung’s KNOX or LG’s GATE So if BlackBerry considers you to have a credible business model, you could be making the BlackBerrys that BlackBerry itself never got around to making, and bid for some lucrative customers. Thurber calls BlackBerry's switch an “outsourcing” move rather than a major strategic change in direction. BlackBerry was already taking third-party reference designs for its phones, such as the DTEK50 phone, which uses a TCL reference design. TCL owns the Alcatel brand, which sells a version without the BlackBerry keys and hardened Linux, as the Idol 4. Under the new arrangement, Chen told financial analysts, the licensee will take on distribution, logistics and repair. “We’re very careful who we’re working with. We want to be very positive; the contracts are long and complex and we’re involved in every stage of the way. We’ll know what’s going on at every stage of the manufacturing process - and we’ll still inject our hardware keys at the right moment.” He explained: “We continue to support the BlackBerry 10 operating system; some companies are interested in licensing it for handsets. If it’s a solid business model going forward we’ll work with a 3rd manufacturer. But we’re not close enough to say we’re going to do that." BlackBerry 10 users have been waiting some time for the NIAP-certified 10.3.3 update. It was originally promised for Q1. Was this because BlackBerry had laid off all the BB10 engineers? "Don't read anything into that," said Thurber. "There were a variety of different issues both internal and external. "We will continue to provide support for the product, until some future date." Thurbur had 10 years' channel experience at Cisco, then stints at Intel’s McAfee and at firewall company WatchGuard. Clearly when BlackBerry hired him it was looking beyond its traditional device distribution partnerships with operators. Towards what exactly? Thurber says it’s because technology sales are converging. In many markets, operators don’t subsidise devices so much any more, if at all, and this opens up an opportunity for end-to-end companies like BlackBerry. “If you’re a reseller or partner who knows about security, then being the trusted advisor to help is an advantage.” BlackBerry opened up its Android bundle to the consumer via the Google Play Store in August and Thurber says it has reached 100,000 downloads. The Hub+ bundle includes an email client, PIM apps and Password Keeper. “A number of large companies are interesting in site licensing Hub+ for all of their employees. It’s not just a great productivity tool but new users like it as well. But there are no plans to throw the BlackBerry keyboard and DTEK up for grabs. You’ll need to buy a BlackBerry-branded phone for that. “Those are core to BlackBerry. I don’t know of anything that’s imminent to change that.” BlackBerry's DTEK60 is imminent, and its promised to bring a QWERTY Android to market too. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 4 Comments More from The Register ‘Inflexion point’ BlackBerry washes hands of hardware biz Switches to licensing 'secure Android' and apps 23 Comments ‘Penultimate’ BlackBerry seen on 'do not publish' page as fire sale begins This is the end, beautiful friend, the end 35 Comments Facebook throws BlackBerry an HTML bone Native apps are soooooo 2015, says BlackBerry, and web apps are the new black 28 Comments Blackberry beats the vendors it trails, finishes Quadrooter patches Both its users, sorry, handsets are safe 9 Comments BlackBerry's new best pals: Microsoft, Google, Samsung 'I cannot buy everything.

The BlackBerry senior VP for sales for its Mobility division Alex Thurber - stopping to talk to El Reg as he sailed through London on his honeymoon - also told us BlackBerry had interested potential licensees for its BB10 platform, and would consider licensing its keyboard know-how too. Last week BlackBerry announced that, with the Mobility Unit failing to meet its profitability target, the company was switching to licensing its software and brand instead, although it would produce at least two more BlackBerry-branded devices. It was no surprise, as Chen had speculated about licensing the brand in New York in July - but nobody noticed. (See BlackBerry chief: We don't have to make phones to make phones “If you listen to John Chen there, he says exactly what’s going to happen,” he noted. Thurber added that the hardened Android will qualify for NIAP certification, a set of security standards required for government use. “We will have a NIAP-certified Android next year,” Thurber confirmed. Typically only devices with secure containers have qualified, such as Samsung’s KNOX or LG’s GATE So if BlackBerry considers you to have a credible business model, you could be making the BlackBerrys that BlackBerry itself never got around to making, and bid for some lucrative customers. Thurber calls BlackBerry's switch an “outsourcing” move rather than a major strategic change in direction. BlackBerry was already taking third-party reference designs for its phones, such as the DTEK50 phone, which uses a TCL reference design. TCL owns the Alcatel brand, which sells a version without the BlackBerry keys and hardened Linux, as the Idol 4. Under the new arrangement, Chen told financial analysts, the licensee will take on distribution, logistics and repair. “We’re very careful who we’re working with. We want to be very positive; the contracts are long and complex and we’re involved in every stage of the way. We’ll know what’s going on at every stage of the manufacturing process - and we’ll still inject our hardware keys at the right moment.” He explained: “We continue to support the BlackBerry 10 operating system; some companies are interested in licensing it for handsets. If it’s a solid business model going forward we’ll work with a 3rd manufacturer. But we’re not close enough to say we’re going to do that." BlackBerry 10 users have been waiting some time for the NIAP-certified 10.3.3 update. It was originally promised for Q1. Was this because BlackBerry had laid off all the BB10 engineers? "Don't read anything into that," said Thurber. "There were a variety of different issues both internal and external. "We will continue to provide support for the product, until some future date." Thurbur had 10 years' channel experience at Cisco, then stints at Intel’s McAfee and at firewall company WatchGuard. Clearly when BlackBerry hired him it was looking beyond its traditional device distribution partnerships with operators. Towards what exactly? Thurber says it’s because technology sales are converging. In many markets, operators don’t subsidise devices so much any more, if at all, and this opens up an opportunity for end-to-end companies like BlackBerry. “If you’re a reseller or partner who knows about security, then being the trusted advisor to help is an advantage.” BlackBerry opened up its Android bundle to the consumer via the Google Play Store in August and Thurber says it has reached 100,000 downloads. The Hub+ bundle includes an email client, PIM apps and Password Keeper. “A number of large companies are interesting in site licensing Hub+ for all of their employees. It’s not just a great productivity tool but new users like it as well. But there are no plans to throw the BlackBerry keyboard and DTEK up for grabs. You’ll need to buy a BlackBerry-branded phone for that. “Those are core to BlackBerry. I don’t know of anything that’s imminent to change that.” BlackBerry's DTEK60 is imminent, and its promised to bring a QWERTY Android to market too. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 4 Comments More from The Register ‘Inflexion point’ BlackBerry washes hands of hardware biz Switches to licensing 'secure Android' and apps 23 Comments ‘Penultimate’ BlackBerry seen on 'do not publish' page as fire sale begins This is the end, beautiful friend, the end 35 Comments Facebook throws BlackBerry an HTML bone Native apps are soooooo 2015, says BlackBerry, and web apps are the new black 28 Comments Blackberry beats the vendors it trails, finishes Quadrooter patches Both its users, sorry, handsets are safe 9 Comments BlackBerry's new best pals: Microsoft, Google, Samsung 'I cannot buy everything.

Shepard Nexus Media posted Oct 5th, 2016 at 10:00am Maya Burhanpurkar Maya Burhanpurkar There’s a moment in Maya Burhanpurkar’s documentary where she stands next to an ice fjord in Ilulissat, Greenland, realizing what climate change means for the people who live there. After listening to residents describe how fast the ice is melting, the 14-year-old student from Ontario, Canada looks into the camera and says: “I think that I’m going to become a lot more conscientious of the environment when I go about my everyday life because after what I’ve seen today, the icebergs and now the ice fjord, I really don’t want that natural landscape to be destroyed. Every single person counts.” Melting ice changed Burhanpurkar’s life and now she’s inspiring others around the world with a documentary about climate change. The film’s title, 400 PPM, refers to the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which now exceeds 400 parts per million, the highest level seen in the history of our species. Since the documentary’s release and Burhanpurkar’s high school graduation this year, atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have continued to climb. Burhanpurkar’s eye-opening voyage happened when she was invited to tour the Canadian and Greenlandic Arctic aboard the Sea Adventurer. It was one of the many honors bestowed on her after she won Canada’s National Science Fair twice and representing Canada in the Intel and Google Science Talent Search Competition. It’s impressive enough that this teenager turned her trip into an acclaimed documentary. But that’s on top of her previous achievements prototyping “intelligent antibiotics,” discovering new properties of a drug to cure Alzheimer’s disease and tracking asteroids. “I have a scientific background,” Burhanpurkar explained. “I’d never done anything creative like this before. It’s not really my forte.” Burhanpurkar made a storyboard and enlisted contacts from other projects to teach her about filmmaking techniques, while friends helped with the editing and production. She also interviewed prominent Canadians to explain the scientific concepts and social issues, including author Margaret Atwood, former astronaut Col. Christopher Hadfield, anthropologist Dr. Wade Davis and Nobel laureate Dr. Brad Bass. Maya Burhanpurkar Burhanpurkar interviews Margaret Atwood. 400 PPM debuted online in November last year and the reception was “absolutely fantastic,” Burhanpurkar said. She heard from viewers as far away as Latvia and China. Friends across Canada told her they watched her video in science class. Recently, Burhanpurkar was among the recipients of the Gloria Barron Prize for Young Heroes for her work on the documentary, which has reached more than 2.2 million students. “In school we learn facts and figures and that it’s going to impact us at some point,” Burhanpurkar recalled. “This could not be further from the truth. “The Arctic is where global warming is changing our planet the fastest,” she explains. “It’s the canary in the coalmine. It’s the Earth’s early warning system and its alarm is going off. We need to act now.” Upon returning home, she realized that her peers knew as little about climate change as she had before visiting the Arctic. “Climate change felt like more of a buzzword than something that required action,” she said. Several of her classmates were stumped when she asked them about climate change — or they supplied simplistic vagary. “Before I went, I was excited to do the whole ecotourism thing,” she said, “but what struck me was meeting the people who are already impacted by climate change.” Between stopping in communities in Greenland and Canada, Burhanpurkar saw her first polar bear, seal and walrus, stood near glaciers, icebergs and ice fjords. Farther north, in Uummannaq, Greenland, Burhanpurkar observed that climate change was hurting the Inuit people along with the ice. Thinning glaciers have made ice fishing nearly impossible, devastating the economy and changing the traditional culture. “It was hardly their fault,” she narrated. “It was ours.” Burhanpurkar will take her new awareness with her when she begins college at Harvard next fall. “I had the opportunity to witness climate change firsthand and it changed my life,” Burhanpurkar said.

Probably VR ADVERTISE SUBSCRIBE CONTACT ABOUT MACHINES How smart is a city? It all depends on location, location, location by Gordon Hunt 5 Oct 2016160 Shares Smart cities. Image: jamesteohart/Shutterstock A growing number of cities worldwide are putting a serious focus on smart technology, with everything from better energy flow to improved communications on the table. But what works where, and why? At a recent smart cities conference in China, a host of city mayors, CIOs and CTOs from around the world spoke to hundreds of onlookers. One by one, they lauded their own initiatives, each aspiring to lead the smartest city in the world. However, it’s a winnerless race with no finish line in existence. Some cities face certain problems, with only a few having unique infrastructure to solve theirs. Though it seems the problems are generally absent when smart city enthusiasts grab the mic. Learning from mistakes “The biggest thing I’ve learned from this event,” said Jessie Adcock, CIO of Vancouver, “is that our challenges are not specific to our city. Others are going through the same stuff. It’s nice to know that.” They were some of the final words at TM Forum’s Smart City InFocus 2016: Yinchuan in September, and they delivered more than most that preceded. Everyone in the public face of anything smart city-oriented seems remarkably positive. ‘We can do this, we can do that, success, success, success’ is the general theme. Adcock, and one or two others, were different. Many of the talks in Yinchuan were jarring, appearing like a series of party political broadcasts but, when talking off stage away from the cameras, the reality began to roll out: for the good, you have to wade through the bad. “We’ve had some failures, and the key is to learn from these,” said Jordi Puigneró, secretary of telecommunications, cybersecurity and digital society in the government of Catalonia. View of Girona. Image: Iakov Filimonov/Shutterstock The pain in Spain Of these failures, Puigneró’s example was a humdinger. In Sant Cugat del Vallès, an area in Catalonia, a proposal to smarten up the parking situation made it through the various early stage teething issues that many ideas must pass. It got all the way to prototype phase, with a subsequent roll-out of sensors proving a “complete disaster,” said Puigneró, talking with Siliconrepublic.com. “They wanted to create an app to tell people what area had free parking spaces,” he said, “so they put magnetic sensors under each space. “It worked off magnets, knowing a car was above it due to the large amount of iron around engines.” Unfortunately, the idea was doomed from the start. The sensors were put at one end of each space, so they didn’t read when drivers reversed their car in with their engine at the opposite end, instead reading that space as vacant. “So they upped the sensitivity of the sensor,” said Puigneró, “but then it was so sensitive, it read cars in spaces to the left and to the right.” ‘New York City’s LinkNYC programme can democratise advertising’ – MINERVA TANTOCO Onwards and upwards A complete failure, and a funny one at that. But it’s the failures that provide significant value. “We learned from that,” he said. Catalonia will never make that mistake again and, through talking with officials and businesses around the world, presumably nobody else will either. Some of Puigneró’s projects currently in the works revolve around agriculture which, beyond tourism, helps fuel Catalonia’s economic power. Drones of all shapes and sizes are being investigated to help deliver treatment to crops, monitor crop growth and even, via land-based robots, pick fruit and vegetables when they are ripe. “We’re creating a cluster of companies that represent 40pc of the drone industry in Spain,” he said. “These are the issues we need to solve so we put the farmers in touch with the drone companies; we are working on various solutions.” If something works well, then agricultural areas around the world could benefit, learning from someone else’s successes and failures. And if it’s an urban issue your city has, look to equivalents elsewhere. Canadian lesson “Toronto, being the largest city in Canada, has the largest number of people who need financial assistance,” said Rob Meikle, CIO of Toronto. “We have approximately 100,000 people who need economic assistance.” The problem Meikle and his colleagues saw was an odd one. When giving financial assistance to the needy, they realised a lot was going wrong. Many of those needing help had no bank accounts so Toronto’s approach to provide people with weekly cheques was flawed. “They would take the cheque and go to a third party to cash it, who would charge up to 30pc to do so. This didn’t make sense, we weren’t helping who we needed to help,” he said. The solution? A city benefits card, which is essentially a debit card. Toronto could eliminate the high volume of processing cheques, the queuing, the costly paperwork “and provide some dignity” in one card-giving swoop. Smart solutions should remove bureaucracy and this is a fine example of just that. So successful is this solution that other Canadian states are interested, with Toronto currently investigating how to broaden out the scope of assistance provided on the cards. “For us, a large city, a large base of people trying to access a service – any way to make it more effective and efficient is good. Adding in some dignity is even better,” said Meikle. Phone a friend Another excellent idea that is turning into a positive solution comes from the US, with New York City’s LinkNYC programme aiming to provide internet hotspots at 7,500 locations. With thousands of payphones left idle after the world went mobile, New York spotted a way to solve a global problem: public access to internet. “We put out a proposal that was very specific,” said Minerva Tantoco, former CTO of New York City. “We wanted to turn payphones into hot spots, it was up to companies to work out how.” The city landed a partnership with a collection of companies, including Qualcomm, to create an entirely new smart network. Each payphone – and thousands of new fixtures in future – is in the process of turning into a modern piece of working street furniture. The hubs have free Wi-Fi up to 1Gb in speed according to Tantoco, charging ports, free emergency calls and accessibility for people in wheelchairs. The companies building the network, in turn, can sell advertising throughout the city at very visible locations. New York. Image: Lee Nanjoo/Shutterstock Sun, followed by rain “It can democratise advertising,” said Minerva. “If you’re a small company, you can buy micro advertising; if you’re a restaurant on that street, you can advertise what’s on sale that day.” New York City, somehow, orchestrated the agreement so that it receives 50pc of all advertising revenue, too. Any cities with a similar congested, payphone-adorned street network will be looking on in interest as the project grows. However, there have been some teething issues. Earlier this month, in-built tablets – originally installed to let people browse the internet – were removed. This was due to people turning up with chairs to spend the day there watching movies, in the middle of the sidewalk, on the city’s dime. Given the high number of homeless people in New York City, the kiosks became an issue, fast. Another lesson learned for the next wave of adopting cities. Dublin answers In Dublin the good, too, has come with the bad. In 2014, Intel was supposed to turn Dublin into the first ‘internet of things’ city by putting gateways at 200 locations, measuring this, reporting on that. Dublin City Council was on board and Intel was keen but, for various reasons, it never came to pass. “It has pivoted,” said one Council member, generously. Other initiatives like that at Croke Park, which is adding some clever smart technology to the stadium experience, are particularly promising. “With three very high stands, you don’t get good exposure to light,” said Dr Suzanne Little of Dublin City University and the Insight Centre for Data Analytics. This means artificial – and incredibly costly – lighting is left on for 22 hours a day, six months of the year. The solution is simple: cameras monitor the sunlight on the pitch, providing Little and her team with information on what time of the day certain sections of the pitch need attention. Bin friendly Elsewhere, the trialling of smart bins in Dún Laoghaire has been a resounding success. It has managed to reduce the amount of times cleaners come to collect rubbish by up to 90pc, according to one person working on the project. Solar-powered compactors create more and more space for added refuse, all the while alerting officials when they’re full. There are other examples of successes, failures or potential for both dotted around the world. Of particular interest is the idea of encouraging users of a bike share scheme to return bikes to empty bays, by rewarding them with discounts. This would negate the need for a truck constantly driving through traffic to deliver bikes to A, even though B and C are full. Something similar in the US could see workers incentivised to leave home an hour later, getting a free coffee for their troubles and reducing traffic congestion in the process. There are also new park bench proposals, with USB charge points and people-monitoring sensors, so city officials know what areas receive the most footfall. That’s before we look at the potential behind solar-powered homes, sharing surpluses throughout their street to benefit all. But, in general, the learning curve seems steep. Should CIOs, CTOs and the companies they engage with spread the news of their trials and tribulations, maybe it will get easier in future. As Adcock said, Vancouver officials are already feeling the benefit of knowing some of their less successful initiatives aren’t unique. Some successes aren’t unique, either.
