Intel Vulkan Linux Driver Now Has Patches For Fast Clears Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 19 November 2016 at 05:29 PM EST. 2 Comments Building off the input attachments work earlier this week for the Intel open-source Vulkan driver (covered in More Intel ANV Vulkan Code Hits Mesa Git, Other Patches Pending), there are now patches up for review to implement support for fast clears. Jason Ekstrand at the Intel Open-Source Technology Center who has been leading the "ANV" Vulkan driver effort wrote this Saturday, "This little series builds on top of the input attachment series I sent out earlier this week and adds support for fast clears in Vulkan. I've tested it on both Sky Lake and Haswell and it has no regressions over the input attachments series." So fast clears are there, great to see it's supported back to Haswell compared to some ANV Vulkan driver features being enabled (at least initially) just for Skylake and newer. The patches don't comment on any performance changes as a result of the fast clears support, but at Phoronix there will be some fresh Intel Vulkan Linux benchmarks coming up shortly. Those wanting to test the patches that apply against the outstanding input-attachments work can find them on Mesa-dev. 2 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

By Christina Beck, Staff November 19, 2016 Save for later Saved Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella addresses a Microsoft media event in New York, Oct. 26. Richard Drew/AP/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of Microsoft announced plans this week to tie executive bonuses to company success at meeting diversity hiring goals, after the number of female hires fell this fall. Silicon Valley has long been aware of its diversity problem, and a number of companies have instituted internal plans to achieve greater diversity. Nevertheless, the tech industry still suffers from a massive diversity gap, with minority groups and women making up a small fraction of new hires and corporate boards. Is Microsoft’s ambitious executive-reward program a credible path to progress for technology companies? Recommended: Do you speak start-up? An entrepreneurial vocab quiz. Bonuses helped at Intel. In January 2015, Intel launched a $300 million diversity initiative, which included  bonuses for referring diverse applicants. This February, Intel announced that 43 percent of all new hires in 2015 were women or minority applicants, marking a massive success for the strategy. Test your knowledge Do you speak start-up? An entrepreneurial vocab quiz. Photos of the Day Photos of the Weekend Diversity experts say that companies must remain persistent and innovative in order to attract more minorities and women to Silicon Valley. “Diversity and inclusion is something you’ve got to ingrain, you’ve got to keep talking about the business value, you’ve got to keep talking about the impact,” Microsoft’s diversity and inclusion officer, Gwen Houston, told Bloomberg. At the industry level, diversity numbers are dismal. Just 15.5 percent of technology company board positions are held by women, reported The Christian Science Monitor's Ellen Powell in October. She wrote: Some of these struggles are societal: Young girls may be taught that engineering isn’t for them, or an absence of role models may make a computing career seem too far out of reach. Other issues are institutional. A study of open-source software-development website GitHub found that women are more likely to have their work accepted than men – but  only if their gender is unknown. Microsoft’s latest effort was inspired by this year’s decrease in the size of its female workforce. Numbers fell by one percentage point, from 26.8 to 25.8 percent, after the divestment of a Nokia factory that employed a number of women. Although the raw numbers are discouraging, however, Microsoft says that the company is also tracking positive trends. For example, the percentage of female workers in non-production sectors actually rose this year by about half a percent. And over the past year, Microsoft reports, more than a quarter of new hires were women. “We are encouraged by the modest gains we’re seeing in female representation in technical and leadership roles, and even more significantly, by the hiring trends of the past year that resulted from our efforts to recruit top-notch female talent,” wrote Ms. Houston in a Microsoft blog post. The tech company also saw tiny gains in diversity hiring, with African American representation at Microsoft growing from 3.5 to 3.7 percent of the company, and Hispanic/Latino representation increasing from 5.4 percent to 5.5 percent. Nevertheless, there is still far to go, says Microsoft. Hence the company’s effort to incentivize the hiring of women and ethnic or racial minorities by linking executive bonuses to diversity hiring. Technology companies face several obstacles in diversity efforts. The percentage of STEM degrees awarded to women has shrunk over the past several decades, from 37 percent of engineering graduating classes in the 1980s, to 19 percent today. Recruiting minority groups can also pose a problem. Microsoft’s announcement does not occur in a vacuum, however. A number of enterprising young people have independently developed groups and tools to encourage women and minorities to pursue tech careers, including the Technovation program at Immaculate Conception Academy, which confronts the cultural barriers that often keep women away from STEM fields. Innovation is also happening at the entrepreneurial level. In April, the Monitor’s Schuyler Velasco reported on such programs, including a firm called GapJumpers, which is dedicated to connecting qualified potential hires to companies through a blind screening process. Groups such as Girls Who Code are also working to break down industry barriers for women of all ages. Besides its executive compensation strategy, Microsoft’s new diversity push also involves diversity recruiting campaigns and investing in STEM programs to increase the applicant pool.

"Starbright Holidays" will feature 300 LED-lit dancing drones in the night sky. With the push of a button, the show begins, as 300 drones rise into the night sky over a nearby lake. You can't see them because it's dark, but you can hear the drone as they get into place in the formation. The music starts and the drones light up — the ballet begins, and the Ohhhs and Ahhhs soon follow, reports the South Florida Reporter. They also published this update from Disney: We’re excited to share an update that the first shows of “Starbright Holidays – An Intel Collaboration” will begin on November 20. You can see the nightly performances at Disney Springs at 7:00 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. from Nov. 20 – Jan 8. The aerial ballet is a collaboration between Disney and Intel, and the show is called, “Starbright Holidays — an Intel Collaboration.” The stars of the show are Intel's new Shooting Star quadcopters. Intel has done this sort of thing before, in Sydney earlier this year, they synched 500 drones. Shooting Star drones only weigh 280 grams. They have a tightly integrated LED payload built into a soft frame made of frangible materials such as flexible plastics and foam. Propellers are protected by covered cages. There are no screws. Intel Josh Walden, the general manager of Intel’s New Technology Group, told Wired, “Our drones, together with Disney’s expertise in animation as well as storytelling, and the music score, together make what we think is going to be a groundbreaking form of entertainment." Disneyland and Walt Disney World had to get a special exemption from the Federal Aviation Administration because both are FAA designated no-fly zones. The exemption permits the park to operate the semi-autonomous drones until 2020 when it expires, according to Mother Nature News. We know from past experiences what Disney and its animators can do, but the drone technology behind the aerial display is fantastic. The little drones only weigh a little over half-a-pound and are about a foot long and wide. The LED light display they carry is able to create over four billion color combinations. Walden says the drones will do anything they tell them, and Intel has created an entire platform to create aerial displays. “The way that they work is that they wirelessly talk with the computer. The drones don’t actually communicate with each other," he says. “You program them upfront for the light show itself, and then the drones essentially are independent.” Walden also says the drones aren't assigned a specific role in the light show. It is only after the computer goes through a number of algorithms, such as GPS signal and battery level on each drone that the drone is assigned a specific part. Then, all the operator has to do is push a button.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 19, 2016 at 11:00AM In a prior column, I reported that Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) upcoming Coffee Lake family of processors would be based on the company's upcoming Cannon Lake architecture, based on information found on Intel's website.  However, instead of being built in Intel's upcoming 10-nanometer manufacturing technology as the proper Cannon Lake products will be, the Coffee Lake parts are expected to be built using some derivative of the 14-nanometer technology first introduced in the second half of 2014. Image source: Intel.  However, a new rumor from a user on the AnandTech forums suggests that at least part of this is not correct. Let's take a closer look. Coffee Lake may be based on Kaby Lake architecture According to user Borealis7 on the AnandTech forums, Coffee Lake for desktops will include six processor cores, use Intel's Kaby Lake architecture, and arrive in 2018. The bits about core count and launch date were already previously leaked, but the information about its being based on the Kaby Lake architecture is new. Indeed, the information Intel had inadvertently made public on its website suggested that Coffee Lake was referred to internally as Cannon Lake, implying that it would include updated processor cores and graphics. If the information from Borealis7 is correct, then it would seem that Coffee Lake for desktops is essentially Kaby Lake, but with up to six processor cores rather than up to four, from an architectural perspective. More cores and better 14-nanometer tech to do the trick? Assuming Borealis7's information is good, then it means that for desktops as well as high-performance notebooks, Intel will essentially have used the same basic Skylake processor and graphics architecture that first debuted in the fall of 2015 for three full product generations. Remember: Kaby Lake used the Skylake architecture, with the performance gains coming primarily from an enhanced 14-nanometer process technology.  If Borealis7 is right, then Intel seems to be betting that additional cores coupled with a yet-again improved 14-nanometer manufacturing technology (see the following slide) will combine to deliver enough of a performance boost to make the Coffee Lake family worthy of being branded eighth-generation Core. Intel's seventh-generation Core processors are built on 14nm+ tech; the company is planning for additional performance enhancements beyond 14nm+. Image source: Intel. Intel claimed to achieve a 12% improvement in its 14-nanometer+ relative to 14-nanometer, and if it can deliver a manufacturing technology-related boost of at least that much with the 14-nanometer derivative it uses to build Coffee Lake, then this -- coupled with the increased core count -- could make Coffee Lake at least as compelling a product offering, relatively speaking, as Kaby Lake will be in desktop computers.   All eyes on Ice Lake and beyond After Coffee Lake, Intel is likely to bring processors based on its Ice Lake architecture to the desktop personal-computer market. Ice Lake is expected to be a new architecture, so performance per clock should go up significantly from Skylake, Kaby Lake, and Coffee Lake to Ice Lake, whether Coffee Lake uses the Skylake architecture or Cannon Lake architecture. Additionally, Ice Lake will be Intel's second architecture built using its 10-nanometer technology. That means investors should expect that it will use the company's performance-enhanced 10-nanometer+ technology rather than the first-generation 10-nanometer technology. It's good to see that Intel is delivering on its commitment to deliver performance improvements for desktop personal computers each year. Nevertheless, I think that Intel can be more aggressive in bringing new processor architectures to its desktop processor families going forward, accelerating its generation-over-generation performance improvements. Indeed, given Intel's gargantuan research and development budget, which in 2015 topped $12 billion, recycling an architecture for three full generations -- even though Intel is planning to deliver performance improvements with each generation -- doesn't sit right.  We'll see if this is what Intel ultimately does over the next year or so.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

The official clip, below, shows 100 drones dancing around to form a spinning Christmas tree. There are other videos abound on YouTube that show a few other elements. Or better yet, make a trip to Disney Springs to take a watch for yourself. Listening to the show’s announcement it appears this is just the beginning in this relationship. I’m sure the creative minds at Intel and Disney Imagineers will deliver an even more impressive show down the road. Drones are magic The idea itself isn’t crazy to comprehend, each drone acts as a pixel. However, gathering all the data, accounting for weather conditions, making 100 drones move in concert with each other, while spinning and lighting up is more complex than you playing around with a drone. That’s a lot of math and, in the end, a really cool result. Intel has tested this technology in the past, you can see some of Intel’s previous projects in the video below: Source Disney Parks Topics #Disney #drones #Intel Roy Choi Roy Choi is a Southern California native.

Intel is laying off a major portion of its wearables group TechCrunch 1 day ago Brian Heater © AP In this Jan. 12, 2011, file photo, the Intel logo is displayed on the exterior of Intel headquarters in Santa Clara, California. According to sources close to the company, Intel is about to step back from wearables in a big way. In 2014, the company purchased Basis, a little known producer of some truly excellent fitness watches. The acquisition was clearly a piece of a much larger puzzle for Intel, as it folded the brand into NDG – the New Devices Group – a new wing designed to make a big play for the booming wearables market, while hitting back against rival chipmaker, Qualcomm. Quotes in the article Intel Corp INTC ▼ 34.95 -0.07 -0.20% Qualcomm Inc QCOM ▲ 67.31 +0.64 +0.96% In June 2015, Intel picked up Recon, makers of wearable heads-up displays for cyclists, snowboarders and the like. Here’s what Recon co-founder, Dan Eisenhardt had to say at the time. Intel is an ideal partner for Recon. Intel’s CEO, Brian Krzanich, made his commitment to wearable technology very clear shortly after assuming his current role in 2013. He reaffirmed that commitment in his keynote speech at the Consumer Electronics Show this January. Brian and his team, including New Technology Group head Josh Walden, share our vision for the potential of smart eyewear in the consumer and enterprise markets, and this deal reflects that shared vision. This summer, however, cracks began to show in the company’s wearable plans. In June, Intel recalled Basis Peak devices due to overheating concerns – effecting, according to the company, roughly 0.2-percent of users. Rather than replacing the units, the company simply stopped sales of the device altogether. Intel took a step further and shut down the Peak’s software support (including cloud storage), effective by year’s end. © Provided by TechCrunch It was clear at the time that this would prove a big setback for Intel’s wearable dreams. After all, the Basis acquisition hadn’t produced much for the company beyond the release of the Titanium, a snazzed up version of the Peak that looked a bit better with a business suit. Now, according to sources close to the company, Intel is planning to take a major step back from its investment in the space – or possibly even exit wearables altogether. The changes will include a large number of layoffs in NDG, along with the larger New Technologies Group into which it was folded back in April of last year – a move already viewed at the time by some as an early sign of Intel’s displeasure with its wearables division. The company has already informed a number of employees about the changes, with many expected to lose their jobs before year’s end. Reports thus far have been varied, but all point to a large job loss for those in the NDG and the possible shut down of the group altogether. © Provided by TechCrunch Along with the layoffs, the move likely means that much NDG’s work will never see the light of day, including Basis Ruby, an unannounced fitness watch, which, at the very least, might have helped buoy the company following the unceremonious death of the Peak. We’ve reached out to Intel and will update the story as soon as we hear back.

By Michael Kassner | November 19, 2016, 6:07 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStock/michaeljung Electronic health records (EHR) theft is the new "low-hanging fruit," meaning the bad guys are having a field day stealing EHR databases. For example, Zack Whittaker in a June 2016 ZDNet post writes, "A hacker who claims to have obtained more than ten million health records is selling the data to the highest bidder on the dark web." However, several experts, including Francois Paget, Charles McFarland, and Raj Samani of Intel Security, noticed something while they were compiling data for their 2015 paper The Hidden Data Economy (PDF): No one knows what's being done with the stolen EHR data dumps. McFarland and Samani, along with researcher Christiaan Beek, decided to see if they could find what's happening to the stolen EHR databases. Less than a year later, the Intel researchers published Health Warning: Cyberattacks are targeting the health care industry (PDF), providing information on how EHR databases are being stolen, how they are sold, and offering some ideas on how the EHR data dumps are being used. More about IT Security The 20 biggest tech disasters of all time Interview with a hacker: S1ege from Ghost Squad Hackers Subscribe to TechRepublic's Cybersecurity Insider newsletter Before getting to the paper's findings, Beek, McFarland, and Samani offer a disclaimer. "We must make one thing clear: It is not our intention to stir up fear," write the authors. "Rather, our aim is to document the threat landscape so that healthcare organizations can take action." As to why fear comes into play, the researchers mention that records of a person's health simply cannot be changed in a fashion similar to canceling stolen credit/debit cards. "Indeed, the nonperishable nature of medical records makes them particularly valuable," mention Beek, McFarland, and Samani. "Because the ability to reduce the impact of a medical data breach is significantly diminished, we must do all we can to reduce the likelihood of successful attacks." SEE: Identity Theft Protection Policy (Tech Pro Research) Cybercrime-as-a-service As with other cybercrimes, stealing EHR databases no longer requires technical proficiency. The researchers offered evidence that vulnerabilities are actively being sold, and "compromise-as-a-service" is a thriving business. The researchers write, "To put this in perspective, a relatively nontechnically-proficient cyber thief buys tools to exploit a vulnerable organization, uses them with a little free technical support, and then extracts 1,000 records that could net him about 15,564 dollars." If that's still too complicated for would-be criminals, the researchers add, "Rather than 'buying the RDP,' the attacker could simply have acquired an active account belonging to a health care organization." SEE: Electronic health records: The smart person's guide (TechRepublic) Are EHRs really for sale? Next, the research team verified that EHRs were, in fact, for sale. Beek, McFarland, and Samani write, "Quickly, we discovered dark web vendors offering for sale huge data dumps of stolen medical data. In some instances, its availability was highly publicized." Figure A is one seller's website offering a database containing almost 400,000 EHRs. The database includes names, addresses, and data about the patient's health care provider. Figure A Image: Intel Security, Christiaan Beek, Charles McFarland, and Raj Samani Hiding in plain sight It is apparent that cybercriminals are not timid. Sellers are unafraid to advertise stolen EHR databases on social-media outlets, as shown in the tweet by TheDarkOverlord in Figure B. Figure B Image: Intel Security, Christiaan Beek, Charles McFarland, and Raj Samani Twitter has removed the above tweet, but it is a digital "whack-a-mole" game as sellers quickly open new accounts using different credentials or advertising a different EHR data dump. But is anyone buying? It is clear records are being stolen and offered throughout the Dark Web, but is anyone buying, and if so how are the records being used? Regarding data-dump purchases, the researchers offer as proof review websites, similar to the one shown in Figure C, that rate sellers of stolen data. Figure C Image: Intel Security, Christiaan Beek, Charles McFarland, and Raj Samani "The seller appears to be active, with 100% positive feedback from 15 interactions to date," note Beek, McFarland, and Samani. "These positive reviews were likely gained as a seller, as the recent feedback clearly indicates." SEE: Gallery: The top 10 Dark Web search engines (TechRepublic) A troublesome issue Even after all their research, Beek, McFarland, and Samani are troubled by the lack of evidence regarding the motivation of the cybercriminals buying EHRs. "With payment card information we have documented that stolen card numbers are used to conduct fraud against the victims," write the researchers. "At present, however, we have not identified specific uses for bulk data purchases of medical data." The research team members vow to continue looking into the theft of EHRs, saying it deserves significant attention. If their track record is any indication, there should be no doubt that the trio will eventually find what buyers of stolen EHR databases intend to do with their purchases.

The 10 most effective brand jingles — From the Intel chimes to 'I'm Lovin' it' Lara O'Reilly Nov. 20, 2016, 4:09 AM 7,495 facebook linkedin twitter email print McDonald's For some brands, an audio logo is just as important as a visual one. Close your eyes, and you'll know it's an Intel ad from its famous chimes. "I'm Lovin' It" is synonymous with McDonald's. And we all know what the "Green Giant" sings. But which brands have the best-performing sound marks? Scroll down to find which brand jingles stand out from the rest amongst consumers in the US. Methodology Veritonic, a marketing analytics platform for commercial music, surveyed more than 2,600 panelists in October 2016 and asked them to listen to audio logos selected from Interbrand's Best Global Brands ranking, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the S&P. Panelists were asked to record their emotions as the logos played and were asked about the feelings the audio evoked. They were then contacted 48 hours later to test recall of audio logos. Panelists' emotions and engagement were also tracked using Veritonic's patent-pending EchoTime technology. Each brand's overall 1-100 score in the ranking combines unaided recall, plus emotion categories including: Excited, happy, approachable, authentic, confident, empowering, innovative, likable, reputable, simple, trustworthy, and unique. View As: One Page Slides 10. T-Mobile. Overall score: 77.4. Unaided recall: 82 T-Mobile's chimes scored well for evoking happy and excited emotions. It doesn't do so well on the unaided recall front, but the mark is distinctive for people who have heard it before — giving it a high engagement score.   9. Statefarm. Overall score: 78.9. Unaided recall: 84 The insurer's beepy audio logo places scored well for "happy" (84), "excited" (74) and "simple" (72). It placed in ninth place for unaided recall, but didn't score well on the engagement metric. 8. Folgers. Overall score: 79.5. Unaided recall: 86 The Folgers jingle — "The best part of waking up, is Folgers in your cup" — is more than 30-years-old, having first launched in 1984. It scored well for emotions including "happy" (82), "reputable" (78), "approachable" (78), and "authentic" (78) — all the types of feelings a coffee company would be hoping to evoke from listeners. Folgers was tied in third position for unaided recall. 7. Chevy. Overall score: 79.5. Unaided recall: 88 Chevy's whistled audio mark is unusual as, unlike many other brands, it sometimes plays at the start of an ad rather than the end (although it plays at the end of the video above). The logo scores well in the "authentic" (78), "confident" (78), "approachable" (76), "trustworthy" (76) and "reputable" categories. However, it underperformed in the "excited" attribute, scoring just 68. 6. McDonald's. Overall score: 79.6. Unaided recall: 85 "I'm Lovin' It" launched globally in 2003, sung by Justin Timberlake, and it has been McDonald's ad jingle ever since. The logo scores 84 for "excited" and "82" for happy. It tied third for unaided recall. 5. Hot Pockets. Overall score: 80.5. Unaided recall: 85 Famous for the memorable microwave "ding," the sung Hot Pockets audio mark scored well for unaided recall. It was also a top performer in the "happy" (86) and "excited" (76) categories.   4. Green Giant. Overall score: 80.8. Unaided recall: 86 "Ho, ho, ho, Green Giant" has been in-market since the 1960s, giving the logo a strong unaided recall score. It scored well for "happy" (86) and "authentic" (78), however, the jingle only scored around average on "excited" (76) and lagged behind the other top scorers in terms of engagement. 3. Intel. Overall score: 82.7. Unaided recall: 88 Probably the most famous audio logo of the bunch, the Intel chimes are internationally recognized, earning them an unaided recall score of 88. Intel ties first for evoking a feeling of "innovation" (70) amongst listeners. It was also near the top of the pile on "excited" (80) and in the overall engagement metrics. 2. Farmer's Insurance. Overall score: 83.2. Unaided recall: 88 "We are Farmers! Bum ba dum bum bum bum bum." The Farmer's Insurance audio mark is a relative newcomer in this top 10, as far as on-air promotion is concerned. It's a top performer in several of the emotion scores including "trustworthiness" (74), "uniqueness" (74) and was joint top on "innovative" (70) and "empowering" (74). 1. Nationwide. Overall score: 87.2. Unaided recall: 92 Nationwide's "Nationwide is on your side" jingle has been on air for more than 50 years and is still as relevant today as it ever was, according to this study. The audio logo demonstrably leads the pack when it comes to unaided recall and was in the top decile of performers for engagement. It also scored big on "happy" (84), "excited" (76), and "simple" (74). "The speed and pattern of the responses by panelists to the audio logo demonstrates how deeply planted the audio logo has become in panelists' psyches," Veritonic writes in the report.  More: Audio Logo Features facebook linkedin twitter email print × Recommended For You Powered by Sailthru The 10 most effective brand jingles — From the Intel chimes to 'I'm Lovin' it' The 10 most effective brand jingles — From the Intel chimes to 'I'm Lovin' it' For some brands, an audio logo is just as...

It seem Intel is waking up to that fact, as new reports indicate the company is laying off almost all the staff from its wearable division. This also comes after the debacle surrounding Intel’s own Basis Peak smartwatch, which was recalled earlier this year over concerns of overheating and burning users. Speaking to TechCrunch, sources close to Intel have said it is planning a large number of lay offs from its New Devices Group (NDG), followed by an overall backing away from the wearables market. “Reports thus far have been varied, but all point to a large job loss for those in the NDG and the possible shut down of the group altogether,” the outlet wrote. Also published was a photo of an unannounced wearable called the Basis Ruby, a smartwatch with heart-rate, activity, and sleep tracking features, but which appears to have been cancelled in the wake of discontinuing the Basis Peak after its recall. It’s not clear how many lay offs Intel’s NDG will see or when it will become official, however TechCrunch‘s sources say it will take place before the year’s end. The NDG was already folded into Intel’s New Technologies Group back in April, so an entire closure of the NDG could lead to wider restructuring within the division.

In English На русском Հայերեն Full version November 19, 2016 - 15:16 AMT SHARE Intel backing away from wearables, reports suggest When Intel bought Basis back in 2014, there were hopes the acquisition would push the wearables firm to the next level. Sadly, things didn't go that way -- the company's first Intel-backed product had a tendency to catch fire, and was subsequently pulled from the market earlier this year. Now, any hope for a bounce back has been all but extinguished: as Engadget reports citing a report from TechCrunch, Intel's wearable division is facing massive layoffs. According to TechCrunch, sources close to the company say that Intel is planning to back away from the wearable space -- and will soon lay off staff in its New Devices Group. In addition to the layoff report, TechCrunch also managed to get a few pictures of the Basis Ruby, an unannounced fitness wearable that will now never see the light of day.

Now a report claims that Apple may have intentionally throttled the former variant so that it was on-par with the latter. According to Bloomberg, researchers at Twin Prime and Cellular Insights evaluated the Qualcomm-powered Verizon and Intel-carrying AT&T versions of the iPhone 7. The firms found that the two were mostly equal in terms of speed even though the former is technically able to download data faster. This leads us to the theory of the hour, which is that Apple isn’t taking full advantage of all of Verizon’s network capabilities. The X12 Qualcomm modem found inside the carrier’s iPhone 7 model is capable of pushing up to 600Mbps, while the AT&T Intel one boasts of a lower 450Mbps.

Analysts think the brand may have done this so that everyone has a uniform iPhone 7 experience. This conclusion is backed by insider sources who told Recode that Apple wanted the cost savings and flexibility of having multiple suppliers for its chips, while also wanting the two models to be as similar as possible. The latter may have been done to avoid making AT&T and T-Mobile angry. This makes sense, since it would be unfair for Verizon customers to have better speeds. However, the apparent throttling may still make many consumers angry given that their iPhone 7 is possibly not living up to its full potential. To make matters worse, Twin Prime pitted the iPhone 7 against the Samsung Galaxy S7 and found that the second was two times faster than the first. Both were utilizing Qualcomm’s X12 modem and run on Verizon’s network.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Nov 18, 2016 at 7:07PM The market for augmented reality apps and devices, which superimpose digital objects over real world ones, could grow from practically nothing today to $90 billion by 2020, according to tech M&A advisory firm Digi-Capital. After early blunders like Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Glass, the AR market recently gained mainstream momentum with the popularity of Niantic's Pokemon Go -- which prompted many investors to seek out AR-related stocks. Image source: Getty Images. Most "pure play" AR companies are start-ups instead of publicly traded companies. However, there are still a few ways that investors can gain valuable exposure to the AR market via bigger tech companies. Let's examine four such companies -- Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Google, and STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM). Microsoft Microsoft's HoloLens can project 3D Minecraft on table tops, project interactive holograms of 3D designs for graphic and industrial designers, and even "teleport" another person's full-body hologram into your room. Several major partners, including Lowe's and Volvo, already use HoloLens to showcase their products in augmented reality. Microsoft's HoloLens. Image source: Microsoft. Microsoft's upcoming Windows 10 Creator Update will add 3D image capture and editing tools to the OS, which will enable artists and developers to create 3D objects which can be viewed in HoloLens and its upcoming VR headsets. Microsoft claims that the tools will be so user-friendly that 12-year-olds can create their own holograms. However, the developer version of HoloLens still costs $3,000 -- indicating that it won't become a mainstream gadget anytime soon. Intel Intel's major play on AR is Project Alloy, a reference design for AR headsets similar to the HoloLens. The device is powered by Intel's sixth generation Core processor and its RealSense depth-sensing cameras. Unlike HoloLens, Project Alloy doesn't need to be tethered to a PC. By offering this reference design to OEMs that want to quickly release AR headsets, Intel could widen its moat against challengers like Qualcomm. Intel's Project Alloy. Image source: Intel. Intel is also investing heavily in the computer vision technologies, which AR apps, drones, and autonomous cars need to "see" obstacles. It acquired computer vision companies Itseez and Movidius over the past year, which could enhance the ability of its RealSense cameras to identify objects and surfaces. Google Google has noticed the game-changing potential of Intel's RealSense cameras in the AR market. Earlier this year, it partnered with Intel to develop Project Tango, a platform which enables smartphones and tablets to identify real-world objects with the RealSense camera and project AR overlays on them. For example, a user looking through a Project Tango display could change the walls and floors of a real room, or put virtual masks and costumes on nearby people. We haven't heard much about Project Tango since then, but many industry watchers have suggested that the project could be merged with its new VR platform Daydream. Google has also invested heavily in Magic Leap, an AR start-up which is reportedly developing a mixed reality headset akin to the HoloLens. It's still unclear how all these pieces will come together, but Google will likely adopt a more cautious strategy after Glass flopped due to its awkward appearance, pricing issues, and privacy concerns. STMicroelectronics STMicroelectronics manufactures a wide variety of chips for connected cars, wearables, and Internet of Things gadgets. It also makes motion sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes) for smartphones and tablets. STMicro lost ground in motion sensors to its smaller rival InvenSense over the past few years, but it recently launched an ultra-low power 6-axis gyroscope and accelerometer combo device designed specifically for VR and AR devices. The device has already been certified for use with both the Project Tango and Daydream platforms. As the AR and VR markets grow, rising demand for more motion sensors should enable STMicro to leverage its scale and offer its sensors at lower prices than InvenSense. STMicro is also heavily invested in the computer vision market -- it manufactures ADAS (advanced driver assistance systems) leader Mobileye's EyeQ computer vision chips, and produces LIDAR technologies for autonomous driving, AR, and VR uses with Microvision. The key takeaways Microsoft, Intel, Google, and STMicro all represent interesting ways to gain exposure to the AR market, but investors should note that they won't represent major sources of revenue for these companies yet. But if the market takes off over the next few years, all four companies could reap some big rewards. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 18, 2016 at 7:07PM For about a decade, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has used processors designed and manufactured by microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in its iMac desktop and MacBook laptop computer families.  Apple iMac and MacBook computers. Image source: author.  However, as Apple's chip design prowess has grown, primarily to support its non-Mac products such as the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, speculation has run rampant that Apple would eventually build processors to replace Intel's in the Mac.  Were that to happen, Intel's personal computer processor business would be negatively impacted, but Intel's business would be able to weather it (sales to Apple comprised less than 10% of Intel's total revenue in 2015).  It still hasn't happened, though.   Nevertheless, a new report from investment company Exane BNP Paribas (via The Street) suggests that Apple might be hiring engineers to build chips that will finally allow Apple to boot Intel out of the Mac. Let's take a closer look at what the analysts had to say.  Apple is hiring graphics engineers? You don't say! The analysts reportedly point out that Apple's looking to fill 87 hardware engineering positions related to graphics processing technology. Based on this, the analysts said that "the graphics job vacancies suggest that Apple is building a completely new chip design team, which in our experience points to a new application." The analysts further went on to say that "the need for computing, CPU and/or GPU skills could point to a custom Apple chip for the Apple MacBook." "It is entirely plausible that Apple could produce a beefed up 7 [nanometer] apps processor... capable of powering a MacBook in 2018," the analysts concluded. I'm not buying it. What else requires CPU and/or GPU technology? Inside of every Apple iPhone and iPad is an Apple-designed applications processor. These chips integrate a whole host of technologies, including CPUs, graphics processors, image processing units, memory controllers, and more. Microprocessor expert David Kanter recently revealed in an article published on website Real World Technologies that Apple has been using custom-designed graphics processors in its iPhone and iPad chips since the A8/A8X chips. Previous Apple chips incorporated graphics processor designs licensed from graphics specialist Imagination Technologies (NASDAQOTH:IGNMF). It is far more likely that the job listings indicate that Apple is trying to bolster the graphics processor teams that build technologies for Apple's iPhone and iPad devices rather than for its Mac products.  So, about the Intel thing... Only Apple knows if its long-term plan is to replace Intel's processors with its own chips.  That said, a transition away from Intel processors and toward Apple-designed ARM processors across Apple's Mac lineup is unlikely to happen in the near-future, if it's going to happen at all.  Indeed, all of the software that runs on the Mac -- both first-party and third-party -- would need to be reworked in order to properly function on ARM processors, as it is all designed around Intel's technology. Yes, Apple has done such architecture transitions on the Mac before, but the last time that the company did one (moving from PowerPC to Intel), Apple gave developers ample notice so that they could get their software ready (the PowerPC to Intel transition was announced at World Wide Developers Conference 2005; the first Intel-based Macs didn't ship until WWDC 2006).   To my knowledge, Apple hasn't given developers such a heads-up about a transition of the Mac from Intel to ARM.  Nevertheless, the point here isn't whether or not Apple is ultimately planning to kick Intel out of the Mac; the point is that the fact that Apple is hiring experts to work on graphics processor technology is hardly evidence that Apple is planning to replace Intel in the Mac.

Apple Purposely Throttles Down Some iPhone 7 Data Speeds in the United States GO Verizon's iPhone 7 version should be faster than AT&T's Nov 19, 2016 03:28 GMT  ·  By Andrei Vlad  ·  Share:  It's a common fact that Apple uses components from different suppliers with each iPhone the company launches, and this year's model is no exception. For example, in the United States, there are two different versions of the iPhone 7, but they're only different because they embed different components, not because one performs better than the other. Bloomberg reports that Verizon's iPhone 7 is equipped with a Qualcomm X12 modem, while the AT&T/T-Mobile version comes with an Intel XMM 3360. On paper, the Qualcomm X12 modem should perform much faster than the Intel XMM 3360. According to their respective specifications, Qualcomm's latest X12 modem is capable of downloading data at up to 600 megabits per second, while the Intel modem can only reach up to 450 megabits per second. However, in reality, both modems are about the same when it comes to performance. Apparently, Apple has decided to throttle down the Qualcomm X12 modem, as not to upset carriers and customers alike. A field test that put the Galaxy S7 equipped with the Qualcomm X12 and the iPhone 7 with the same modem chip against each other showed that Samsung's smartphone was twice as fast on the same network. iPhone 7 Basically, we now have two iPhone 7 versions that perform the same, but one of them could be faster than the other if Apple enabled the full power of the Qualcomm X12 modem. Obviously, that's not going to happen since the Cupertino-based company has no intention of angering either AT&T or T-Mobile, as well as their customers in the United States, by making one of the iPhone 7 variants weaker than Verizon's model.

However, there are still a few ways that investors can gain valuable exposure to the AR market via bigger tech companies. Let’s examine four such companies — Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Google, and STMicroelectronics (NYSE: STM). More From Fool.com Microsoft Microsoft’s HoloLens can project 3D Minecraft on table tops, project interactive holograms of 3D designs for graphic and industrial designers, and even “teleport” anotherperson’s full-body hologram into your room. Several major partners, including Lowe‘s and Volvo, already use HoloLens to showcase their products inaugmented reality. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT Microsoft’s HoloLens. Image source: Microsoft. Microsoft’s upcoming Windows 10 Creator Update will add 3D image capture and editing tools to the OS, which will enable artists and developers to create 3D objects which can be viewed in HoloLens and itsupcoming VR headsets. Microsoft claims that the tools will be so user-friendly that 12-year-olds can create their own holograms. However, the developer version of HoloLens still costs $3,000 — indicating that it won’t become a mainstream gadget anytime soon. Intel Intel’s major play on AR is Project Alloy, a reference design for AR headsets similar to the HoloLens. The device ispowered by Intel’s sixth generation Core processor and its RealSense depth-sensing cameras. Unlike HoloLens, Project Alloy doesn’t need to be tethered to a PC. By offering this reference design to OEMs that want to quickly release AR headsets, Intel could widen its moat against challengers like Qualcomm. Intel’s Project Alloy. Image source: Intel. Intel is also investing heavily in the computer vision technologies, which AR apps, drones, and autonomous cars need to “see” obstacles. It acquired computer vision companies Itseez and Movidius overthe past year, which could enhance the ability of its RealSense cameras to identify objects and surfaces. Google Google has noticed the game-changing potential of Intel’s RealSense cameras in the AR market. Earlier this year, it partnered with Intel to develop Project Tango, a platform whichenables smartphones and tablets to identify real-world objects with the RealSense camera and project AR overlays on them. For example, a user looking through a Project Tango display could change the walls and floors of a real room, or put virtual masks and costumes on nearby people. We haven’t heard much about Project Tango since then, but many industry watchers have suggested that the project could be merged with its newVR platform Daydream. Google has also invested heavily in Magic Leap, an AR start-up which is reportedly developing a mixed reality headset akin to the HoloLens. It’s still unclear how all these pieces will come together, but Google will likely adopt a more cautious strategy after Glass flopped due to its awkward appearance, pricing issues, and privacy concerns. STMicroelectronics STMicroelectronics manufactures a wide variety of chips for connected cars, wearables, and Internet of Things gadgets. It also makes motion sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes) for smartphones and tablets. STMicro lost ground in motion sensors to its smaller rival InvenSenseover the past few years, but itrecently launched an ultra-low power 6-axis gyroscope and accelerometer combo device designed specifically for VR and AR devices. The device has already been certified for use with both the Project Tango and Daydream platforms. As the AR and VR markets grow, rising demand for more motion sensors should enable STMicro to leverage its scale and offer its sensors at lower prices than InvenSense. STMicro is also heavily invested in the computer vision market — it manufactures ADAS (advanced driver assistance systems) leader Mobileye‘sEyeQ computer vision chips, andproduces LIDAR technologies for autonomous driving, AR, and VR uses with Microvision. The key takeaways Microsoft, Intel, Google, and STMicro all represent interesting ways to gain exposure to the AR market, but investors should note that they won’t represent major sources of revenue for these companies yet. But if the market takes off over the next few years, all four companies could reap some big rewards.

Gen. Michael Flynn, President-elect Donald Trump's preferred choice for National Security Adviser, was running a company that was lobbying on behalf of foreign clients even as he was receiving classified intelligence briefings during the campaign. The revelation comes as the Trump camp has taken a series steps to curb the involvement of lobbyists in the presidential transition efforts. Robert Kelley, a former chief counsel to the House National Security Subcommittee and current general counsel and principal at the Flynn Intel Group, filed a lobbying disclosure report with Congress on September 15. According to the official document, Kelley was working on behalf of Inovo BV, a Dutch firm owned by Turkish businessman, Kamil Ekim Alptekin. Alptekin told CNN in an email that the firm works to strengthen "the transatlantic relationship and Turkey's future in that alliance." Read More Kelley's connection to the Flynn Intel Group and Alptekin were first reported in the Daily Caller. Ranking Member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Elijah Cummings sent a letter to Trump transition chair Mike Pence expressing concerns over Flynn's "apparent conflict of interest." "President-elect Trump promised during his campaign that he would 'drain the swamp,' but his top national security advisor is Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, whose firm is reportedly being paid to lobby the U.S. Government by a close ally of Turkey's president," the Maryland Democrat wrote. "It is unclear how Lt. Gen. Flynn was reportedly allowed into intelligence briefings during the campaign despite these apparent conflicts of interest." Trump's transition responded to questions about the lobbying effort with a statement Friday, saying that Flynn's career was within his right as a "private citizen." "After devoting his life to serving his country, Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn became a private citizen and opened a private consulting business to advise companies on various issues. Gen. Flynn has said that he will sever ties to his consulting firm if he ever returned to government service and that is what he will do in the Trump Administration." Alptekin is the chair of the Turkish-American Business Council and helped organize Turkish President Recep Erdogan's 2015 visit to Washington. But while Alptekin acknowledged having a commercial relationship with the Flynn Intel Group, he told CNN that Flynn himself "does not work on my contract." He also adamantly denied any connection to the Turkish government. "Neither Inovo, any of my other companies or my person are affiliated to the Turkish government in any form whatsoever," he said. He added that his company's contract with Flynn's company "is not about representing the position of the Government of Turkey" However, the fact that Flynn was overseeing a company that was lobbying on behalf of foreign clients at the same time he was attending classified briefings alongside Trump seems to complicate the transition, especially given Trump's stated goal of "draining the swamp" in Washington. Flynn, who as America's top military intelligence officer was already privy to volumes of classified material, is obligated to not share that information with any outside entity. While Flynn had the highest level of clearance while serving as the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, experts on security clearances told CNN that his firm's business arrangements with foreign companies would be closely looked at by background investigators before Flynn could receive additional intelligence briefings in his new role. "They would certainly look at it carefully," Sean Bigley, a security clearance lawyer and former government background investigator told CNN. Although Bigley said there was no restriction on someone like Flynn working for foreign companies upon leaving office he said Flynn would have to inform background investigators of these business relationships in order to be able to continue to receive classified briefings. But other lawyers specializing in security clearance issues said Flynn simply informing investigators of his company's ties to Inovo might not protect him from having his security clearance revoked. Bradley Moss, an attorney who routinely represents defense contractors in security clearance disputes, said Flynn's actions would likely raise a red flag. Flynn's lobbying work, according to Moss, could potentially jeopardize his ability to get cleared as national security advisor. "Security adjudicators would have concerns that someone with Flynn's level of experience wouldn't think twice about sitting in on a classified briefing while working for foreign clients," Moss said. "The moment he sat in on classified briefings, his association with his own company had to be severed." "By not doing that he exposed himself unnecessarily to foreign influence and raised questions about his good judgment," Moss added. Asked about Flynn's business dealings, CNN counterterrorism analyst Phil Mudd told CNN's Wolf Blitzer Friday that that type of work was not unusual and that his activities should not prevent him from taking on the role of national security advisor. "I don't think those should be a bar to duty," he said. But while he said his business relationships were not disqualifying, Mudd, a former CIA analyst, said Flynn's temperament would not serve him well in the role. The intelligence briefs containing some classified were first given to both candidates in August and Flynn accompanied Trump during at least one brief. It is unclear if Flynn informed investigators of his company's ties to Inovo. His representatives did not reply to a request for comment. Flynn told the Wall Street Journal that if he were to officially join the Trump administration he would sever ties with his company, which is described as providing "all source intelligence support to global challenges." "If I return to government service, my relationship with my company will be severed in accordance with the policy announced by President-elect Trump," he said. Flynn's connection to Turkey drew scrutiny after he penned an Election Day op-ed in The Hill newspaper, which said the US should extradite the exiled cleric Fetullah Gulen to Turkey. The Turkish government has accused Gulen of being behind the July coup and has demanded the US hand him over. The Justice Department is currently reviewing the case for extradition. But Alptekin said he and his company had nothing to do with Flynn's op-ed. "If he had asked me whether to publish it, I would have advised against it for a variety of reasons," he said.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 18, 2016 at 7:07PM For about a decade, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has used processors designed and manufactured by microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in its iMac desktop and MacBook laptop computer families.  Apple iMac and MacBook computers. Image source: author.  However, as Apple's chip design prowess has grown, primarily to support its non-Mac products such as the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, speculation has run rampant that Apple would eventually build processors to replace Intel's in the Mac.  Were that to happen, Intel's personal computer processor business would be negatively impacted, but Intel's business would be able to weather it (sales to Apple comprised less than 10% of Intel's total revenue in 2015).  It still hasn't happened, though.   Nevertheless, a new report from investment company Exane BNP Paribas (via The Street) suggests that Apple might be hiring engineers to build chips that will finally allow Apple to boot Intel out of the Mac. Let's take a closer look at what the analysts had to say.  Apple is hiring graphics engineers? You don't say! The analysts reportedly point out that Apple's looking to fill 87 hardware engineering positions related to graphics processing technology. Based on this, the analysts said that "the graphics job vacancies suggest that Apple is building a completely new chip design team, which in our experience points to a new application." The analysts further went on to say that "the need for computing, CPU and/or GPU skills could point to a custom Apple chip for the Apple MacBook." "It is entirely plausible that Apple could produce a beefed up 7 [nanometer] apps processor... capable of powering a MacBook in 2018," the analysts concluded. I'm not buying it. What else requires CPU and/or GPU technology? Inside of every Apple iPhone and iPad is an Apple-designed applications processor. These chips integrate a whole host of technologies, including CPUs, graphics processors, image processing units, memory controllers, and more. Microprocessor expert David Kanter recently revealed in an article published on website Real World Technologies that Apple has been using custom-designed graphics processors in its iPhone and iPad chips since the A8/A8X chips. Previous Apple chips incorporated graphics processor designs licensed from graphics specialist Imagination Technologies (NASDAQOTH:IGNMF). It is far more likely that the job listings indicate that Apple is trying to bolster the graphics processor teams that build technologies for Apple's iPhone and iPad devices rather than for its Mac products.  So, about the Intel thing... Only Apple knows if its long-term plan is to replace Intel's processors with its own chips.  That said, a transition away from Intel processors and toward Apple-designed ARM processors across Apple's Mac lineup is unlikely to happen in the near-future, if it's going to happen at all.  Indeed, all of the software that runs on the Mac -- both first-party and third-party -- would need to be reworked in order to properly function on ARM processors, as it is all designed around Intel's technology. Yes, Apple has done such architecture transitions on the Mac before, but the last time that the company did one (moving from PowerPC to Intel), Apple gave developers ample notice so that they could get their software ready (the PowerPC to Intel transition was announced at World Wide Developers Conference 2005; the first Intel-based Macs didn't ship until WWDC 2006).   To my knowledge, Apple hasn't given developers such a heads-up about a transition of the Mac from Intel to ARM.  Nevertheless, the point here isn't whether or not Apple is ultimately planning to kick Intel out of the Mac; the point is that the fact that Apple is hiring experts to work on graphics processor technology is hardly evidence that Apple is planning to replace Intel in the Mac.

But you probably won't notice. This isn’t another Antennagate. by Ina Fried Nov 18, 2016, 6:17pm EST tweet share Linkedin Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images A mini firestorm erupted today over a report that Apple was purposely limiting the performance of the modem chip in the iPhone 7. Bloomberg reported that Apple was intentionally throttling the performance of the Qualcomm modem chip inside some versions of the iPhone 7, in order to make it more similar to the Intel chip it was using in some other versions of the phone. That’s true, at least according to sources I talked to. Apple supposedly did this for a simple reason: It wanted the cost savings and flexibility of having two chip sources but also wanted the different versions of the phone to be as similar as possible (to avoid angering AT&T and T-Mobile and their customers in the U.S., for example). The result is that the modem in the Verizon/Sprint version of the phone, while just as good and perhaps a bit better than the one in the AT&T/T-Mobile version, is technically not fully living up to its potential. The real, and harder, question is just how big of a deal this is. The short answer is that it probably results in some loss of download speed, but in the context of other variables like network quality, signal strength and specific phone activity, it is hard to isolate in real usage. A more complete explanation requires getting into the weeds and trying to answer a theoretical-but-difficult question: What would the performance of an iPhone 7 be if it used the full potential of the Qualcomm chip? We don’t know because one doesn’t exist. Since we can’t answer that, we have to look at the question a couple of other ways. One can compare an iPhone 7 with a Qualcomm X12 modem to one with an Intel XMM 3360 chip. Bloomberg did that, in conjunction with some analyst firms, and found that the Qualcomm chip still slightly outperformed Intel. But this only tells us that Apple was able to mostly level the playing field, not how uneven it was to begin with. One can also look at how a phone with an unhobbled Qualcomm chip performs and compare that to the Qualcomm-powered iPhone, but that introduces all sorts of other variables as well. For their parts, Intel and Qualcomm both declined comment. Apple, repeating the statement it made to Bloomberg, said that “every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple's wireless performance standards, quality metrics, and reliability testing.” “In all of our rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards, in thousands of hours of real-world field testing, and in extensive carrier partner testing, the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models,” Apple said. But, of course, that just means Apple did its intended job of limiting the Qualcomm chip in such a way that it performs similarly to the Intel one. That answer sheds no light on how fast the Qualcomm iPhone 7 would be absent such limitations. It’s also worth noting that it is not unheard of for companies to have two component sources, creating some performance differences. With the iPhone 6S, for example, Apple had some of its processors made by Samsung’s manufacturing plants and others by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. The result was not an enormous performance disparity, but some users noticed enough of a difference, especially in battery life, to raise the issue. Nor is it unheard of for product makers to limit some features in order to make the performance of a device consistent regardless of component differences, as Apple appears to have done here. That said, Apple is clearly valuing its own cost savings and supply chain flexibility over peak performance. Had it wanted the greatest speed and compatibility, it could have just used Qualcomm’s chip across all the models. Having made the decision to use Intel modems for some phones and Qualcomm for others, analysts say, Apple was probably wise not to allow one model to have a significant advantage. “Apple chose to use different modems for leverage and redundancy, and carriers had no real say in that,” Jackdaw Research analyst Jan Dawson told Recode. “So it would be a little unfair if Apple allowed, say, Verizon and Sprint to say that their iPhone performs better than AT&T and T-Mobile’s.” Dawson added that device makers often choose not to use all the potential features of a component, and do so for a variety of reasons. “The reality is, of course, that every phone maker makes decisions about how to balance battery life and performance across a variety of components, and so you rarely see a phone that’s maxed out on all possible performance parameters because it would be terrible for battery life,” he said. recode_divider More From Recode ‘SNL’ spoofs the very real San Francisco and New York City culture bubbles Here’s what it’s like to ride in a self-driving Tesla Full transcript: Smosh and ScreenJunkies boss Keith Richman on Recode Media Here’s why Twitter turned down a Donald Trump advertising campaign Amazon is tweaking Donald Trump with a new Prime ad promoting religious tolerance Trump demands the cast of 'Hamilton' apologize for 'harassing' Mike Pence Trending Here’s what companies like Google, Facebook and Apple lost when Trump’s win killed the Trans-Pacific Partnership Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey says a white-supremacy ad the company showed users was a ‘mistake’ LinkedIn’s CEO says more than five million jobs will be lost to new tech by 2020 Here’s the secret to Starry Internet’s plan to beam the internet to your house and break up the broadband monopoly Full transcript: ‘Mr. Robot’ creator Sam Esmail on Recode Decode More in Trending Newsletters Recode Daily Top stories of the day.

(PHOTO: Allison Walker Torres, Staff) By Allison Walker Torres, Entertainment Reporter/Anchor Last Updated: Friday, November 18, 2016, 5:44 PM EST LAKE BUENA VISTA --  Disney Springs is rolling out a brand new holiday show featuring drones. "Starlight Holidays - an Intel Collaboration" is touted as a first-of-its-kind light show featuring 300 Intel Shooting Star show drones. Drones over Disney Springs light up in more than 4 billion color combinations Drone show coming to Disney Springs starts Sunday, Nov. 20 Christmas tree trail, other activities available at Disney Springs "[I got] a little knotted up in my throat watching it," said Brian Mahan, Orlando, after catching the sneak peek in the sky. "It was pretty amazing. Unexpected." "I think the music with it makes it even more enjoyable - it gets you wrapped up in it a little more," said Judy Cook of Pennsylvania, gesturing to a lump in the throat. The drones have built-in LED lights that can create more than 4 billion color combinations. “We are excited to work with Walt Disney Imagineering to bring a fresh and innovative approach to its world-renowned light shows,” Senior Vice President and General Manager of Intel’s New Technology Group Josh Walden, said in a statement. “Together, we worked to tackle the new frontier of entertainment, picturing the sky as our canvas, and flying lights as ink.” "What a surprise," Brandon Saldivar of Orlando said. "Talk about being innovative." "I compared it to regular fireworks and this is a lot neater in the sense that they stay up there," said Judy's husband, Joe. &amp;nbsp; Get this - the drones are controlled by a single pilot. But Disney Springs Marketing Manager Darcy Clark says they do have a back-up. She's also surprised by the weight of each drone. "They're extremely light," Clark said. "They actually weigh less than a volleyball." So we had to ask - where do they fly off to when the show's over? "Disney magic!" Clark laughed. "It's the magic of Disney, Allison!" The "Starlight Holidays" will debut Sunday for nightly performances at 7 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. The show will run through Jan. 8. Meanwhile, another new attraction at Disney Springs for the holiday season is its Christmas Tree Trail. "It's a full experience in the Marketplace," said Nico Agrusa, Disney Springs' Marketing Coordinator. "Each tree is decorated specifically for some of our Disney stories." From Cinderella and Beauty & the Beast to Mickey and Minnie at the head of the trail. Whether it's baby's first Christmas or your first as a couple, the trail features 15 trees to serve as your holiday photo backdrop. Also taking place right now, special seasonal entertainment, meet and greets with Santa, and festive decor throughout all four neighborhoods – Town Center, The Landing, West Side and Marketplace. latest news: christmas SunRail to run Saturday for Florida Classic, Magic games Tampa transforms Curtis Hixon Park for the holidays Send us a photo of your holiday home New 'show drones' at Disney Springs starts Sunday Send us photos of your holiday home New shows debut at Disney's Magic Kingdom Grinchmas, Macy's parade return to Universal Orlando holidays Consumer Wise: Hiring a professional holiday light decorating team New holiday experiences arrive at Disney Springs StormTracker 13 Radar Learn more  |  BHTV for iOS  |  BHTV for Android  |  BHTV for Kindle Fire  |  PC/Laptop Get the News 13+ App Download the News 13+ app for the latest News, Weather and Real Time Traffic at your fingertips.

The move is a form of pressure to incentivize top leadership to reform the company’s hiring practices in an effort to include more women and minorities. After Microsoft wrote off the acquisition of Nokia’s handset unit and fired thousands of employees, it saw its percentage of female employees dip to 25.8 percent from 26.8 percent a year ago. The move mirrors that of fellow tech company Intel, which in August of 2015 announced it would commit $300 million to improve the diversity of its workforce. As part of the initiative, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said his company would tie executive compensation to meeting the diversity goals it sets. As of February 2016, Intel has surpassed its initial goals by raising the number of women and minorities represented in new hires to 43 percent. Microsoft is following Intel by financially pressuring its leadership to diversify hiring So while Intel has shone that this strategy works, there’s also a personal element at play. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is still reminded regularly of a controversy he sparked two years ago when speaking at the Grace Hopper Celebration, a women in tech conference held annually in Houston, Texas. When asked how women should go about actively closing the pay gap, Nadella adviser the audience of women technologists to have faith and hope for adequate rewards, instead of asking to be paid fairly. It did not go over well. “I answered that question completely wrong,” Nadella said in a statement issued after his onstage appearance. “If you think you deserve a raise, you should just ask.” The aftermath of the gaffe has made diversity a particular focus of Nadella at Microsoft, and the executive has shifted funding to help bolster internship programs and better equip the company’s human resources group to meet diversity goals. “Diversity and inclusion is something you’ve got to ingrain, you’ve got to keep talking about the business value, you’ve got to keep talking about the impact,” said Gwen Houston, Microsoft’s chief diversity and inclusion officer, in an interview with Bloomberg. “That’s what Satya has been doing. We, of course, have more to do.” - Source: Bloomberg More From The Verge Sand's End Facebook won’t call itself a media company.

It’s called the GX800, and comes packed with an 18.4-inch screen backed by Nvidia’s G-Sync technology to provide the ultimate gaming-on-the-go at a 4K UHD resolution. So let’s just get to the meat with a nice table: Display: 18.4-inch LED-backlit with G-Sync Resolution: 3,840 x 2,160 Processor: Intel Core i7-6820HK Chipset: Intel CM236 Express Graphics: 2x GeForce GTX 1080 in SLI VRAM: 16GB combined Memory: Up to 64GB DDR4 @ 2,800MHz Storage: 3x 512GB PCIe Gen 3×4 SSDs (RAID 0) Networking: Wireless AC, Bluetooth 4.1 Webcam: HD Audio: 4x 3-watt speakers, array microphone Ports: 1x Microphone jack 1x Headphone jack 2x USB 3.1 Type-C 3x USB 3.0 Type-A 1x Ethernet 1x HDMI 1x Mini DisplayPort 1x SD card reader 1x Docking port Battery: 76 watt-hours (8-cell) Size: 18.03 x 13.30 x 17.87 inches Weight: 12.56 pounds Hyro Overclocking System size: 14.13 x 16.45 x 5.23 inches Hydro Overclocking System Weight: 10.36 pounds Operating system: Windows 10 Home or Windows 10 Pro The processor offered in this new Asus ROG laptop was released in the third quarter of 2015, thus it’s a sixth-generation “Skylake” processor, and not from Intel’s current “Kaby Lake” lineup of notebook processors. On its own, the i7-6820HK chip costs $378, and packs four cores, eight threads, and a max power requirement of 45 watts. The base clock speed is 2.70GHz and the max turbo speed is 3.60GHz while the integrated HD Graphics 530 component has a base clock of 350MHz and a max speed of 1.05GHz. Backing this processor are two Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 graphics processors with a combined VRAM capacity of 16GB. Keep in mind that a single GTX 1080 costs $600, so expect to pay at least $1,578 solely based on the CPU and GPUs alone. This trio will provide one heck of a PC gaming punch, backed by up to 64GB of DDR4 system memory and a speedy SSD. More: Asus’ powerful new gaming laptop has the muscle for virtual reality The new laptop will be paired with the company’s Hydro Overclocking System, an external device that connects to the laptop to liquid-cool the GPUs and CPU for “extreme” overclocking. This system will enable the processor to be overclocked up to 4.2GHz and the GPUs up to 1.9GHz thanks to the coolant pumped in and circulated around the three chips. The circulated air is then returned to the cooling module that consists of two radiators for dissipating the heat. To handle the cooling system, the laptop is packed with two 330-watt power adapters. “Some may question this solution and ask why not put the graphics cards in the dock, quite simply put — GX800 is created for the ultimate experience whether you’re near the dock or not,” the company said this week. “No, putting the dock on your lap is absolutely not necessary. In addition, if using a dock with external graphics air-cooled, compromises are necessary when it comes to bulk and silent operation.” Other notable features packed into the new Asus ROG laptop include a MechTAG keyboard that relies on mechanical switches. This keyboard offers 2.5mm of key travel, 100 percent anti-ghosting, a 30-key rollover, and RGB LED effects that can be customized for each key. The laptop is obviously ready for virtual reality, too, as it is capable of cranking out frame rates way beyond the required 90 frames per second. As always, Asus didn’t provide any information on when this laptop will be available, or on how much the base configuration will cost.  But it won’t come cheap given the added liquid-cooling dock, the ROG backpack, and the ROG suitcase.

Sabato 19 novembre: ripartiamo da urbanistica e mobilità Ricerca per: Home Speciali Immediapress Sigfox, the World's Leading Provider of Internet of Things Connectivity, Announces a Record Funding Round Posted By: Redazione Web 18 novembre 2016 – Sigfox, the world’s leading provider of connectivity for the Internet of Things (IoT), today announced it is closing its Series E funding round of €150 million to accelerate the expansion of its global network and soon reach worldwide coverage. Salesforce, Total, Henri Seydoux, Alto Invest, Swen CP and Tamer Group will join Sigfox as new investors. Existing shareholders including Bpifrance, Elliott, Intel Capital, Air Liquide, Idinvest Partners and IXO, will also re-invest in the company. Additional new investors are also expected to join this financing round shortly to reach the €150 million level. The IoT space opens up new and exciting opportunities by connecting the physical world to the Internet. With its global network, Sigfox gives a voice to billions of objects, allowing them to play a pivotal role in our social and economic development. In just five years, Sigfox has built a unique global wireless network that provides a simple, efficient connectivity solution, enabling devices to connect to the cloud at ultra low-cost and using minimal energy. No other network than Sigfox’s has a worldwide footprint and can claim to connect fully autonomous energy harvesting objects. Thanks to Sigfox, every object will connect to the cloud at minimal cost, by relying only on the surrounding energy sources. This promise, along with the significant developments made by the company over the past 18 months, have contributed to the successful closing of this round of funding. With more than 10 million objects registered on its network and coverage currently spanning 26 countries, Sigfox is reinforcing its position as a global leader in the IoT space. This new round of funding will enable the company to expand its international network to 60 countries by 2018 and reach financial breakeven point. The company sees Industry 4.0 as one of the main growth paths driving the development of the IoT. The need for predictive maintenance as well as the continued evolution of its business model towards more services could be some of the reasons behind Total’s decision to join other shareholders supporting Sigfox’s international development. “We are happy to accompany the development of Sigfox because the technology it offers can be decisive to accelerate the deployment of the Internet of things. It is their advance acquired on the market in a short time and their capacity to accelerate the deployment of large-scale IoT solutions that motivated our investment”, commented Patrick Pouyanne’, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Total. “This type of solution will improve the performance and operational safety of industrial activities, reduce operating costs, but also be used to serve customers “ Another key opportunity is the optimisation of industrial processes leveraging big data. For this reason, Sigfox plans to integrate with Salesforce’s IoT Cloud, unlocking insights from the connected world that empower any business to take the right action, for the right customer, at the right time across global consumer and business use cases. By connecting billions of objects and events, Sigfox and Salesforce IoT Cloud can facilitate deep and meaningful customer experiences via its global, homogenous and scalable network. Intel Capital, Idinvest Partners and IXO PE, which are historical shareholders of Sigfox, actively participated in this round. “We strongly believe that Sigfox has unlocked the IoT connectivity bottleneck and will bring billions of objects online in the near future. Its cost effective, easy to use, open platform solution is set to become the standard for low power object connectivity, bringing massive productivity gains to the corporate world and everyday benefits to end customers”, said Franck Tuil, Elliott’s Senior Portfolio Manager. “I created Parrot 22 years ago, and I know how much it takes to carry out ambitious projects on a large scale. I am impressed by the huge progress made by Sigfox over the last three years I have spent as a member of Sigfox’s board of directors. I am now convinced of the colossal growth potential of the market Sigfox successfully addresses. Alongside the financial investment I am making today in the company, I am willing to provide Sigfox’s management with my support as an entrepreneur”, said Henri Seydoux, CEO of Parrot. “The Internet of Things is one of the next big transformational technologies, and we are proud to support Sigfox as the infrastructure leader. We are pleased to see a strong startup ecosystem being built around this world-class technology.”, said Paul Francois Fournier, Executive Director of Bpifrance. Commenting on the announcement, Xavier Drilhon, deputy CEO of Sigfox said, “I joined Sigfox 18 months ago because of the incredibly powerful vision of its founders and the unique positioning of the company as a fundamental enabler of the IoT revolution. Our rapid international expansion made possible thanks to the support of our local operators, as well as the growth of our ecosystem, were key to securing this new fundraising. This will allow the company to accelerate the deployment of its network from 26 countries today to over 60 within the next two years, representing 90 per cent of the worldwide GDP.” “When we met in 2010, we agreed that Sigfox could change the world by bringing the virtual and physical worlds together through a new paradigm based on the fundamental principles of astrophysics. Today, we have created the equivalent of the world’s largest radio telescope for IoT. Our network is able to connect hundreds of billions of objects to the Internet through advanced radio techniques.” said Ludovic Le Moan and Christophe Fourtet, co-founders of Sigfox. The round comprises a “greenshoe” that will allow new strategic and financial partners to join the share capital of Sigfox shortly. Lazard and Goldman Sachs acted as financial advisors to Sigfox, with Skadden acting as legal advisor and Callisto acting as financial advisors to the management.

Article ID: 665051 Released: 17-Nov-2016 3:05 PM EST Source Newsroom: Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility Add to Favorites more news from this source Share MEDIA CONTACT Available for logged-in reporters only CITATIONS CHANNELS Nuclear Physics, Supercomputing, Technology, DOE Science News, Local - Virginia KEYWORDS Supercomputer, QCD, Cluster Computing, Nuclear Physics, High Performance Computing Newswise — For the third time in its history, Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility is home to one of the world’s 500 fastest supercomputers. The SciPhi-XVI supercomputer was just listed as a TOP500 Supercomputer Site on November 14, placing 397th on the 48th edition of the list of the world’s top supercomputers. The Top500 list was announced Monday, Nov. 14, at The International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis, SC16, in Salt Lake City. It’s announced semi-annually and is comprised of systems that are ranked according to their computation speeds as determined by the LINPACK Benchmark, which is a calculation of a linear system represented by a large double precision dense matrix. SciPhi-XVI was delivered to Jefferson Lab and installed in mid-August and was deployed on Sept. 30 with 200 nodes. An additional 64 nodes were added to the machine in late October, and the High Performance Computing group then benchmarked the machine. The SciPhi-XVI machine benchmarked at 425.8 Teraflops using 256 of its 264 nodes. The cluster’s 264 nodes are comprised of the second-generation Intel® Xeon Phi™ chips, which were released in 2016 and are codenamed Knights Landing. Each node has 64 computing cores, and individual nodes within the machine are connected via the Intel® Omni-Path Architecture, which supports a 100 Gigabit/second data transfer rate between the nodes. “A special Intel distributed LINPACK benchmark software, HPL (High Performance Linpack), was used to rank the Jefferson Lab cluster, and it is based on an open source distribution with performance enhancement for Intel® Xeon Phi™ processors,” said Jie Chen, a member of Jefferson Lab’s High Performance Computing group. “To achieve the performance number for the SciPhi-XVI cluster, a set of HPL running parameters has to be determined through many trials. In particular, the size of the matrix representing the linear equations solved by the HPL was chosen to be 2,457,600.” Jefferson Lab conducts discovery-caliber nuclear physics research in exploring the atomic nucleus and its fundamental constituents, such as protons and neutrons and these particles’ building blocks: quarks and gluons. The theory of how these particles interact -- Quantum Chromodynamics, or QCD, is calculated in the form of lattice QCD, or LQCD. Scientists will use the SciPhi-XVI machine for LQCD calculations, as well as a test system for the use of the Xeon Phi™ processors for analyzing data that is generated in Jefferson Lab’s experimental physics program. The Chroma code, which is used to solve LQCD on the Xeon Phi™ processor platform, will be used with an open source library of equation solvers for LQCD. The High Performance Computing group has been modernizing the freely available Chroma code, so that it will run faster and provide better results, more quickly on the new generations of hardware. “There are always challenges to bringing online state-of-the-art hardware systems. We are very proud of our staff for their hard work and dedication that made this achievement possible,” said Jefferson Lab Chief Information Office, Amber Boehnlein. “This hardware achievement, together with our efforts to continually optimize the performance of our software for the newest systems, positions the laboratory to continue performing great science in high-performance computation.” Jefferson Lab work on Chroma is funded through the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science. The research is carried out in collaboration with partner institutions, such as DOE’s National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) Exascale Science Application Program (NESAP) and the Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing (SciDAC) program. NERSC is a DOE Office of Science User Facility at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Supercomputer computation time on SciPhi-XVI is allocated based on the recommendations of the United States Lattice Gauge Theory Computational Program (USQCD), a consortium of top LQCD theorists in the United States that spans both high-energy physics and nuclear physics. The USQCD consortium developed the QUDA code library that is used with the Chroma code. Jefferson Science Associates, LLC, a joint venture of the Southeastern Universities Research Association, Inc. and PAE, manages and operates the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility for the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science. DOE’s Office of Science is the single largest supporter of basic research in the physical sciences in the United States, and is working to address some of the most pressing challenges of our time.

At Intel’s first “AI Day” in San Francisco, Brian Krzanich, CEO, said the company is “continuing to evolve” and working to provide an “end-to-end AI solution” to allow companies to easily integrate intelligence into their infrastructures. As data generated by companies continues to pile up, the interest in analyzing that data using machine learning and AI has been piqued. The largest technology companies are all making big investments and staking their claims in AI. But while companies such as Google and Microsoft have developed libraries of machine learning tools such as TensorFlow and Cognitive Toolkit, Intel is more focused on updating servers to cope with the intense computation required to process and train AI systems. It has a long history in the semiconductor business, and is making a bold move to retain its "Chipzilla" status by developing its own AI chips. Unlike its main rival Nvidia, Intel has decided to steer clear of GPUs (graphics processing units) – an area where it has little influence – and is instead offering its “Lake Crest” chips, which will be available in 2017. A more powerful chip code-named “Knights Crest” is also in development to be integrated with its Xeon processor series. Both chips are geared toward powering neural networks for deep learning, and promise to optimize performance. Diane Bryant, EVP and GM of the Data Center Group at Intel, announced that Intel plans to slash the time it takes to train neural networks 100-fold by 2020 through its chips and processors. It’s an ambitious goal, and heavily supported by Nervana – a deep learning company that Intel acquired in August. A preliminary version of Intel’s latest Xeon processor, known as “Skylake,” has begun shipping to select cloud service providers. The next upgrade to its Xeon Phi processors code-named “Knights Mill” will be available in the next year. With the help of Google, Intel is moving into the cloud space, as both companies announced a partnership to adapt Google’s open-source container cluster system Kubernetes and TensorFlow to Intel’s architecture. Working together will also strengthen security between Intel’s IOT and Google Cloud, Bryant said. Following suit of other AI companies, Intel also announced it had launched an AI strategy board made up of four researchers: Yoshua Bengio (University of Montreal), Bruno Olshausen (University of California, Berkeley), Jan Rabaey (University of California, Berkeley) and Ron Dror (Stanford University). To do its part in “democratizing” AI, Intel has partnered with Coursera, an online education website originally set up by Andrew Ng, Chief Scientist at Baidu Research, and Daphne Koller, AI researcher at Stanford University, to bring a range of AI courses to the public. “Intel can offer crucial technologies to drive the AI revolution, but ultimately we must work together as an industry – and as a society – to achieve the ultimate potential of AI,” said Doug Fisher, SVP and GM of the Software and Services Group at Intel. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 2 Comments More from The Register IBM's AI guru leaps over to Brit biz benevolent.ai Drug discovery is benevolent business 4 Comments AI, AI, captain: Royal Navy warships to set sail with computer officers STARTLE'd code to make decisions from waves of information 31 Comments BRAAA-AI-NS, BRAAA-AI-NS!

Gen. Michael Flynn, President-elect Donald Trump’s preferred choice for National Security Adviser, was running a company that was lobbying on behalf of foreign clients even as he was receiving classified intelligence briefings during the campaign. The revelation comes as the Trump camp has taken a series steps to curb the involvement of lobbyists in the presidential transition efforts. Robert Kelley, a former chief counsel to the House National Security Subcommittee and current general counsel and principal at the Flynn Intel Group, filed a lobbying disclosure report with Congress on September 15. According to the official document, Kelley was working on behalf of Inovo BV, a Dutch firm owned by Turkish businessman, Kamil Ekim Alptekin. Alptekin told CNN in an email that the firm works to strengthen “the transatlantic relationship and Turkey’s future in that alliance.” Kelley’s connection to the Flynn Intel Group and Alptekin were first reported in the Daily Caller. Ranking Member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Elijah Cummings sent a letter to Trump transition chair Mike Pence expressing concerns over Flynn’s “apparent conflict of interest.” “President-elect Trump promised during his campaign that he would ‘drain the swamp,’ but his top national security advisor is Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, whose firm is reportedly being paid to lobby the U.S. Government by a close ally of Turkey’s president,” the Maryland Democrat wrote. “It is unclear how Lt. Gen. Flynn was reportedly allowed into intelligence briefings during the campaign despite these apparent conflicts of interest.” Trump’s transition responded to questions about the lobbying effort with a statement Friday, saying that Flynn’s career was within his right as a “private citizen.” “After devoting his life to serving his country, Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn became a private citizen and opened a private consulting business to advise companies on various issues. Gen. Flynn has said that he will sever ties to his consulting firm if he ever returned to government service and that is what he will do in the Trump Administration.” Alptekin is the chair of the Turkish-American Business Council and helped organize Turkish President Recep Erdogan’s 2015 visit to Washington. But while Alptekin acknowledged having a commercial relationship with the Flynn Intel Group, he told CNN that Flynn himself “does not work on my contract.” He also adamantly denied any connection to the Turkish government. “Neither Inovo, any of my other companies or my person are affiliated to the Turkish government in any form whatsoever,” he said. He added that his company’s contract with Flynn’s company “is not about representing the position of the Government of Turkey” However, the fact that Flynn was overseeing a company that was lobbying on behalf of foreign clients at the same time he was attending classified briefings alongside Trump seems to complicate the transition, especially given Trump’s stated goal of “draining the swamp” in Washington. Flynn, who as America’s top military intelligence officer was already privy to volumes of classified material, is obligated to not share that information with any outside entity. While Flynn had the highest level of clearance while serving as the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, experts on security clearances told CNN that his firm’s business arrangements with foreign companies would be closely looked at by background investigators before Flynn could receive additional intelligence briefings in his new role. “They would certainly look at it carefully,” Sean Bigley, a security clearance lawyer and former government background investigator told CNN. Although Bigley said there was no restriction on someone like Flynn working for foreign companies upon leaving office he said Flynn would have to inform background investigators of these business relationships in order to be able to continue to receive classified briefings. But other lawyers specializing in security clearance issues said Flynn simply informing investigators of his company’s ties to Inovo might not protect him from having his security clearance revoked. Bradley Moss, an attorney who routinely represents defense contractors in security clearance disputes, said Flynn’s actions would likely raise a red flag. Flynn’s lobbying work, according to Moss, could potentially jeopardize his ability to get cleared as national security advisor. “Security adjudicators would have concerns that someone with Flynn’s level of experience wouldn’t think twice about sitting in on a classified briefing while working for foreign clients,” Moss said. “The moment he sat in on classified briefings, his association with his own company had to be severed.” “By not doing that he exposed himself unnecessarily to foreign influence and raised questions about his good judgment,” Moss added. Asked about Flynn’s business dealings, CNN counterterrorism analyst Phil Mudd told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer Friday that that type of work was not unusual and that his activities should not prevent him from taking on the role of national security advisor. “I don’t think those should be a bar to duty,” he said. But while he said his business relationships were not disqualifying, Mudd, a former CIA analyst, said Flynn’s temperament would not serve him well in the role. The intelligence briefs containing some classified were first given to both candidates in August and Flynn accompanied Trump during at least one brief. It is unclear if Flynn informed investigators of his company’s ties to Inovo. His representatives did not reply to a request for comment. Flynn told the Wall Street Journal that if he were to officially join the Trump administration he would sever ties with his company, which is described as providing “all source intelligence support to global challenges.” “If I return to government service, my relationship with my company will be severed in accordance with the policy announced by President-elect Trump,” he said. Flynn’s connection to Turkey drew scrutiny after he penned an Election Day op-ed in The Hill newspaper, which said the US should extradite the exiled cleric Fetullah Gulen to Turkey. The Turkish government has accused Gulen of being behind the July coup and has demanded the US hand him over. The Justice Department is currently reviewing the case for extradition. But Alptekin said he and his company had nothing to do with Flynn’s op-ed. “If he had asked me whether to publish it, I would have advised against it for a variety of reasons,” he said.

The latest Apple Inc. smartphones that run on Verizon Communications Inc.’s network are technically capable of downloading data faster than those from AT&T Inc. Yet in testing, the two phones perform about the same, according to researchers at Twin Prime Inc. and Cellular Insights. Neither firm is clear on the reason, but Twin Prime says it may be because Apple isn’t using all the potential of a crucial component in the Verizon version. “The data indicates that the iPhone 7 is not taking advantage of all of Verizon’s network capabilities,” said Gabriel Tavridis, head of product at Twin Prime. “I doubt that Apple is throttling each bit on the Verizon iPhone, but it could have chosen to not enable certain features of the network chip.” “Every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple’s wireless performance standards, quality metrics, and reliability testing,” Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said. “In all of our rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards, in thousands of hours of real-world field testing, and in extensive carrier partner testing, the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models." It would be an unusual step for a major phone company to restrain its devices. Normally, companies battle to make the fastest, most reliable handsets. Apple may be doing this because it wants to ensure a uniform iPhone experience, according to analysts. "They don’t want one version to get the reputation that it is better," said Jan Dawson, founder of technology advisory firm Jackdaw Research LLC. "If Apple had a guiding principle it’s that they want to make sure customers were having a consistent performance.” But the move could backfire if customers realize their device isn’t performing to its full potential, or that it’s less capable than other handsets, analysts said. "This may not impact the fanboys, but it may make other consumers think twice about buying an Apple phone, especially if they think they might be purchasing a sub-standard product," said Jim McGregor, an analyst at Tirias Research. The firm does paid analysis for smartphone suppliers, including Qualcomm Inc. and Intel Corp. The component at the root of the performance gap is the modem, a tiny chip buried deep inside a phone’s innards that turns wireless signals into data and voice. The iPhone 7 is the first Apple phone for several years to have versions with different modems. Verizon users get an iPhone 7 with Qualcomm’s latest X12 modem -- capable of downloading data at up to 600 megabits per second. AT&T customers get a handset with an Intel modem that tops out at 450 megabits per second. Apple likely went with multiple suppliers to keep component costs in check. In field tests by Twin Prime, the Verizon version is a little faster than its AT&T stablemate -- but not as fast as it could be. The firm proved this by doing the same tests on the Samsung Galaxy S7, which also runs on Verizon’s network and uses the Qualcomm X12. The S7 was about twice as fast as the iPhone 7 running on the same network with the same modem chip, Twin Prime found. This was based on data from more than 100,000 phones downloading an image in large U.S. cities. Qualcomm’s X12 is capable of dealing with more channels of data simultaneously than its Intel rival, according to a report by Milan Milanovic, an analyst at Cellular Insights, which tests phones and networks. Apple didn’t enable this feature "to level the playing field between Qualcomm and Intel,” Milanovic wrote. Cellular Insights tests phones in labs with equipment that can vary the strength of the signal, basically approximating a phone moving from good coverage to poor coverage. The differences in performance between the handsets Milanovic tested were greatest when the phone signal was weakest, he said.

Four other network testing firms contacted by Bloomberg News said measuring phone data speeds is difficult because performance can be influenced by weather and other factors beyond the control of wireless providers and phone makers. Though none of these other firms disputed the findings of Twin Prime and Cellular Insights. Happy Carriers In addition to creating a unified iPhone 7 user experience, leveling the playing field would also keep wireless carriers happy, according to some industry analysts. “Apple likely has some incentive to balance the performance of its iPhones across its U.S. operator partners," said Jeff Kvaal, an analyst with Instinet LLC. "It would be difficult, for example, to explain to AT&T, which remains the U.S. carrier with the most iPhone subscribers, why Verizon is offering a superior product." Representatives of AT&T, Verizon, Qualcomm and Intel declined to comment. Companies that "de-feature or go with a less-advanced modem" may be left behind as the networks offer faster data speeds, Qualcomm CEO Steven Mollenkopf said in a recent conference call, without naming specific firms. Qualcomm vs. Intel Apple is in this situation because it chose different modems for the latest iPhone. By pitting Intel against Qualcomm, the company may be trying to improve its negotiating position on price. Qualcomm’s modems have for years been almost ubiquitous in high-end smartphones, including iPhones. Intel has struggled to break into this market and has used subsidies to try to win share in mobile. Sacrificing performance in return for cheaper components may not go down well with Apple users.  "It was probably multiple factors that drove that decision. But in the end, it was a bad decision," said McGregor. "It is really hard to argue for doing this because Qualcomm really does have the best modem technology." Still, many users may not realize their iPhone is different from their friends’ iPhones. And even if they do, they may decide Apple isn’t responsible. Most consumers blame their wireless service provider when a phone doesn’t work well, Milanovic said. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The next-generation processor range is aimed firmly at deep learning and neural networks. Intel made the announcements during its inaugural "AI Day" today. It explained how it plans to integrate technology from Nervana, a company it acquired just two months ago, into its wider product range. It expects to see Nervana tech inside Intel silicon in the first half of 2017. Intel is building two new series of Xeon processors called Lake Crest and Knights Crest. Lake Crest is optimised for neural networks and is designed specifically to offer the highest possible performance for training AI systems. It offers "unprecedented" computing density, according to Intel. The company expects to deliver a 100x reduction in the time taken to train new complex neural networks by the end of the decade. The breakthrough improvements will be driven by technology developed by Nervana that increases the maximum density of computing architectures. It removes some of the limitations of traditional systems. "We expect the Intel Nervana platform to produce breakthrough performance and dramatic reductions in the time to train complex neural networks," said Diane Bryant, executive vice president and general manager of Intel's Data Center Group. "Before the end of the decade, Intel will deliver a 100-fold increase in performance that will turbocharge the pace of innovation in the emerging deep learning space." Intel is also planning a next-generation line of Xeon Phi processors. This range, code-named Knights Mill, will be available in 2016 and will offer up to 4x increased deep learning performance over today's systems. The new chips will give AI developers more flexibility when developing complex systems, enabling AI to do more in real-time. Training new systems will be significantly faster, enabling a new wave of AI that's more advanced. Intel is treading a very different path in AI to that of its industry rivals. Whereas Intel is continuing to stick with CPU-based technology, companies such as NVIDIA are gaining ground by bringing GPUs to the table. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich dismissed GPU tech as a long-term solution, describing it as an "opportunistic" approach to developing AI. He suggested CPU architectures such as Lake Crest, Knights Crest and Knights Mill will enable the next wave of AI development, pointing to Intel's broad product range as a significant asset in the years to come. "Some scientists have used GPGPUs because they happen to have parallel processing units for graphics, which are opportunistically applied to deep learning," said Krzanich. "However, GPGPU architecture is not uniquely advantageous for AI, and as AI continues to evolve, both deep learning and machine learning will need highly scalable architectures. Intel architecture can support larger models and offer a consistent architecture from edge to the data center." Intel also announced a new "strategic alliance" with Google. The two companies will work together to create an "open, flexible and secure" multi-cloud infrastructure that will mutually benefit both businesses. Separately, Intel will donate $25 million to the Broad Institute to help develop high-performance computing systems for genomics analytic projects. The money will help to create new infrastructure to help scientists integrate and process genomic data.

He then participated in a live demo that involved using a dollar bill to cut through (virtual) chunks of gold. The headset was called Project Alloy, Krzanich said, and Intel was officially working with Microsoft on the device to offer a "merged reality" experience. With the race to get humans wearing face computers heating up, it’s no surprise that Intel decided to join the likes of Samsung, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Sony, HTC, Qualcomm, and others in creating a solution that could hopefully, possibly, maybe, help VR make the leap from ultra-nerdy to sorta-mainstream. And after having missed the boat on mobile, Intel is trying to ensure that it’s well-positioned for the next big wave of computing. Intel’s pitch with Project Alloy is that it has figured out a way to offer a PC-like VR experience without the need to tether the headset to a computer system. The reference design has two processors, Intel’s RealSense 3D cameras, and a detachable, rechargeable battery. The first headset that ships will be based on Microsoft’s Windows Holographic desktop software. Okay. So what’s "merged reality"? Vjeran Pavic It’s a good question, and it’s one I’ve been asking ever since Intel first dropped the term this summer. Fortunately, Intel was willing to let The Verge into its labs and let us try on an early version of a Project Alloy headset to get a better sense of how it works. In short, merged reality means you can see real-world stuff in front of you, even while you’re wearing a full headset. The RealSense cameras on the headset capture images of the things in front of you and project them back into your virtual environment in milliseconds. If Microsoft’s HoloLens headset creates a layer of augmented reality on top of the real world, and Oculus Rift blocks you out entirely from the real world, Project Alloy falls into a bizarre place somewhere in between. I could see my hands and take a selfie while wearing a full VR headset While I was wearing the Project Alloy headset, I could still see my Verge colleagues Vjeran and Tyler standing nearby. I could use a physical pen as a tool within a virtual game. If someone handed me a piece of paper and a pen, I could still see well enough write a note with it — while I had the VR headset on. I could check the time on a real, physical watch. I could even take a selfie with my phone while wearing the headset. Vjeran Pavic Arguably, this type of virtual-world-meets-real-world interaction is safer because you’re able to see people and objects in front of you, even while your head is enveloped in a giant face computer. Project Alloy also eliminates the need for additional sensors or hand controllers in order to have an interactive experience. I played an interactive Raiders of the Lost Ark-type game in a dark room while wearing the Samsung Gear VR headset, but the room was filled with sensors that made interacting with the room possible. My mind was blown the first time I tried Oculus Rift and Oculus Touch together, throwing balls and other objects into a virtual void, but I was also using hand controllers. Heads floated in and out of frame, pixelated versions of people who were there in real life The Project Alloy headset I tried was only version one, though, and it was easy to see why Intel isn’t rolling this one out to market. The prototype was ill-fitting on my head, with enough room on the underside to see the (real) floor below me. Headset fit, like headphones, is too subjective to judge harshly, but it felt heavy, too. Intel says an ideal weight for a headset built off the Project Alloy reference design is 750 grams, or around 1.5 pounds. The real-life objects I saw before me while I was wearing the headset — my hands waving in the frame, an Intel employee standing in the lab — were pixelated. Heads floated in and out of frame, depending on how close I was standing to a person in real life. Interactions with these digitized humans in my virtual world had a slightly morbid element to them, as though I was watching an old, low-quality home movie of someone waving and smiling at the camera; not really knowing if that person existed in real life or not. Vjeran Pavic It was more of a conceptual experience than a demo of a finished product, a half-glimpse at what could be. But Tim Parker, Intel’s vice president and GM of marketing for perceptual computing, insists that next year’s Project Alloy, the one that it plans to ship in the second half of 2017, will offer a better experience. The one I tried runs on an Intel Core processor built on last year’s Skylake architecture and uses an Atom chip for compute vision. These will be upgraded to a Kaby Lake processor and a chip from Movidius, which Intel acquired this fall. The two R200 RealSense cameras used in the current headset will be upgraded to one single 400 series RealSense camera, shown off at the same developers conference earlier this year. And the real Project Alloy headset will include the option for a discrete graphics card. So far, Microsoft is the only company that has publicly committed to working with Intel on Project Alloy, although the idea is that this VR solution will be intriguing — and unique — enough to attract other potential partners. Intel is becoming well-known for making neat tech demos that don’t always find traction in the real world, and Project Alloy could absolutely become another one of those. At the same time, if anyone is going to figure out how to strike the right balance between just-okay mobile VR and heavy-duty tethered VR headsets, it might as well be Intel, one of the world’s largest chipmakers. Intel knows there’s no way to win the virtual reality game if you don’t play, and so we have Project Alloy. As unfinished as it is, it’s still fun to slip in and out of reality with it.

While stocks have rallied, the sell-off put many of the top dividend-paying stocks right back in the wheelhouse for investors looking for solid total return. We screened the Merrill Lynch research universe for large cap technology stocks that were rated Buy and pay a dividend. We found five that make good sense for investors looking to put some cash to work now. Intel This leader in semiconductors is working hard to scale away from dependence on personal computers. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) designs, manufactures and sells integrated digital technology platforms worldwide. The company’s platforms are used in various computing applications comprising notebooks, two-in-one systems, desktops, servers, tablets, smartphones, wireless and wired connectivity products, wearables, retail devices and manufacturing devices, as well as for retail, transportation, industrial, buildings, home use and other market segments. The company also provides communication and connectivity offerings, such as baseband processors, radio frequency transceivers and power management integrated circuits, and tablet, phone and Internet of Things solutions, which include multimode 4G LTE modems, Bluetooth technology and GPS receivers, software solutions and interoperability tests, as well as home gateway and set-top box components. Intel reported an inline third quarter, but data center sales came in way below expectations for the tech giant. Intel does a stunning 82.4% of their sales overseas, the lion’s share of it in Asia, where the chips that it produces are used in personal computers, tablets and other personal electronic devices. Fears of trade issues with China have taken a toll on the stock, and the timing looks good. Intel investors receive a 3.0% dividend. The Merrill Lynch price target for the stock is $42. The Wall Street consensus target is $40.26. The shares closed Thursday at $35.02. Microsoft This is another top old-school technology stock that gives investors a degree of mega-cap tech safety, and it has a massive $105 billion sitting on the balance sheet. Microsoft Inc. (NASDAQ: MSFT) continues to find an increasing amount of support from portfolio managers, who have added the software giant to their holdings at an increasingly faster pace all of this year and last. Numerous Wall Street analysts feel that Microsoft has become a clear number two in the public or hyper-scale cloud infrastructure market with Azure, which is the company’s cloud computing platform offering. Some have flagged Azure as a solid rival to Amazon’s AWS service. Analysts also maintain that Microsoft is discounting Azure for large enterprises, such that Azure may be cheaper than AWS for larger users. The top analysts believe the company continues to make steady progress with its cloud transition and expect Office 365 and Azure to be solid contributors to top and bottom line for the next several years. While not likely to snag the top slot from Amazon, it could add huge incremental revenue for years to come, especially when you factor in the huge revenue potential from the banks, insurance companies and the financial services industry. The company announced in mid-summer a gigantic all-cash, $196 per share offer for LinkedIn. While some on Wall Street gasped at the huge premium paid, Microsoft continues to expand its product lines and cut its dependence on software sales. While it remains to be seen how the fit will be, the analysts like the overall product synergies the deal brings. Microsoft investors receive a 2.57% dividend, and the forward valuation remains compelling. The Merrill Lynch price target is $68. The consensus target is $63.79. The stock closed Thursday at $60.64. Oracle This top software stock has traded sideways since the spring and looks to be putting in a nice cup and handle formation. Oracle Corp. (NYSE: ORCL) develops, manufactures, markets, sells, hosts and supports database and middleware software, application software, cloud infrastructure, hardware systems and related services worldwide. The company licenses its Oracle Database software to customers, which is designed to enable reliable and secure storage, retrieval and manipulation of various forms of data. Its Oracle Fusion Middleware software aims to build, deploy, secure, access and integrate business applications, as well as automate their business processes. Trading at 15 times estimated 2016 earnings, and sporting a solid free cash flow yield, many analysts also feel that as the company’s 12C database cycle starts to contribute during calendar 2016, the stock could very well be poised for what they term a breakout year. After recent investors meetings, some analysts raised fiscal year 2017 cloud margins to 66% from 63% and earnings per share to $2.80. Merrill Lynch and others on Wall Street feel that the software giant may be on the verge of a multiyear database product cycle. Investors receive a 1.5% dividend. The $48 Merrill Lynch price target compares with the consensus target of $44.58 and Thursday’s close at $40.25. Texas Instruments This old-school chip tech company was out of favor but has come back solid. Texas Instruments Inc. (NASDAQ: TXN) is a global semiconductor design and manufacturing company that develops analog integrated circuits and embedded processors. The company generates 80% to 90% of its revenues from its analog and embedded processing businesses, which have well-diversified end-markets (autos, industrial, personal/consumer electronics), long product life cycles and limited capital intensity. The company has 6% market share of the auto chip market. Numerous Wall Street pros see the stock as core large cap holding, and they cite a solid high-single-digit and very diverse revenue flow, solid capital allocation to lever the balance sheet if needed, and substantial room for margin expansion as the ramp up new facilities. The company boasts sustained impressive cash flow over the past several years and has impressively returned 100% plus of that back to shareholders via stock buybacks and dividends. Texas Instruments posted strong third-quarter numbers and also increased its quarterly dividend by 32% to $0.50 per share, or $2.00 annualized. The increase reflects the company’s continued strength in free cash flow generation and its commitment to return excess cash to shareholders. Top analysts cite the potential for reduced corporate taxes, infrastructure spending and also increased defense spending as positive for the chip giant going forward. Investors receive a 2.77% dividend with the new increase. Merrill Lynch set its price target at $82, while the consensus price objective is $74.34. The shares closed Thursday just below that, at $72.08. Qualcomm This top technology stock has done very well this year. Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM) is a world leader in 3G, 4G and next-generation wireless technologies. The company includes the licensing business, QTL, and the vast majority of its patent portfolio. Its subsidiary Qualcomm Technologies operates substantially all of Qualcomm’s engineering, research and development functions, as well as substantially all of its products and services businesses, including its semiconductor business, QCT. Qualcomm reported third-quarter revenue and earnings that beat Wall Street estimates. Fourth-quarter guidance was also better than expected. In China, new semiconductor products are gaining share and management is making better progress with royalty collections. The analysts are bullish on the company’s acquisition of NXP Semiconductors, which Qualcomm is buying in an all-cash deal at $110 per share. The deal is expected to close at the end of 2017 and should be immediately accretive to earnings. The merger brings together complementary products for mobile, automotive, Internet of Things and networking applications. Investors receive a 3.22% dividend. Merrill Lynch has a $76 price objective, while the consensus target is $73.10. The shares closed at $66.67.

While the 13-inch versions have only Intel integrated graphics, the 15-inch models additionally have AMD Radeon Pro discrete GPUs. But some 15-inch models are apparently claiming to have higher-spec Intel GPUs also. MacRumors reports that some readers are finding System Information displaying ‘Intel Iris Pro Graphics 580’ instead of the 530 variant actually fitted. While it’s not absolutely impossible for component shortages to lead to Apple silently fitting higher-spec parts to machines, it seems virtually impossible here given that the 580 version is only available in much more power-hungry processors – and there are two further clues in this case that it’s a simple software glitch. First, none of those whose machines are reporting the more powerful GPU are seeing any actual difference in performance. Second, some note that System Info switches between reporting a 530 or 580 depending on whether they are running on battery or mains. So almost certainly no free upgrades here: just a reporting glitch.

Feral Joins The Bandwagon Of Wanting Newer Mesa On Ubuntu Written by Michael Larabel in Mesa on 18 November 2016 at 08:49 AM EST. 59 Comments With Mesa drivers this year really improving a lot and reaching OpenGL ~4.5 compatibility for most drivers as well as the Intel and RADV Vulkan drivers getting into shape, they are becoming usable for day-to-day Linux gamers. While not all new Feral Linux game releases work with the Mesa drivers, a growing number of their games work well on Mesa 13.0+, and as such they are hoping Ubuntu will adopt a policy of making it easier to switch to newer Mesa releases. Edwin Smith of Feral Interactive wrote a proposal on the ubuntu-desktop list today of wanting to see Mesa stable releases added to the graphics-driver PPA. The graphics-driver PPA launched a year ago as a way for easily getting newer proprietary AMD/NVIDIA drivers on Ubuntu in a semi-official manner. But now the hope is that Mesa stable releases could be added here too for making it easier to get the new releases rather than waiting for new Ubuntu releases or LTS point releases for providing these big driver updates. The Feral representative wrote, "We have been working with the Mesa community to help improve the Mesa drivers so more games can run on AMD and Intel hardware, and in the last year this has started to hit the tipping point and support has become more and more viable when using the very latest drivers. The biggest issue we have is there is no way for a user to officially download and install the latest stable versions of Mesa. For example because the official Mesa 13.0.1 release isn’t available to install on Ubuntu, you need to compile it yourself...Almost every Feral title would benefit from running on the latest version of the Mesa drivers as they bring performance, stability and much needed features. Many titles simply cannot run without the latest drivers. This is also true for most other games from other developers as well. This should really help adoption of the newer graphics drivers on Mesa which should help improve the experience AMD and Intel users have when using Ubuntu as they will have much easier access to the latest drivers." Feral also commented they can't officially endorse the Oibaf or Padoka PPAs for Mesa Git drivers since "they often contain serious bugs that are still being fixed." This Feral proposal is not about pushing down Mesa updates down to Ubuntu users as stable release updates via the main archive. Frankly what I would rather see in an ideal world is where they package up a known good Mesa commit on a bi-weekly or monthly basis. Currently major Mesa releases only come every three months, but it often ends up being around four months between releases due to delays. In those releases are big improvements and while it's been just one month since Mesa 13.0, in Mesa 13.1-dev is already OpenGL 4.5 being officially exposed for RadeonSI, many RADV and ANV Vulkan driver improvements, and a ton of other work. But that Mesa 13.1 release probably isn't coming until January. If there was a PPA of Mesa every few weeks from a good state and some basic QA passes, this would likely be much better for Linux gamers. But even if just the new Mesa stable releases get added to the graphics-drivers PPA, it still would be better for those wanting a stable experience but cautious about building Mesa themselves and not wanting to ride the Git train with Padoka or Oibaf. This would also be better for new Feral game releases where Mesa developers tend to land improvements shortly after a game's release, but could still be months before it is found in a stable release, unless it's a candidate for backporting. It will be interesting to see where this discussion leads.

Salesforce, Total, Henri Seydoux, Alto Invest, Swen CP and Tamer Group will join Sigfox as new investors. Existing shareholders including Bpifrance, Elliott, Intel Capital, Air Liquide, Idinvest Partners and IXO, will also re-invest in the company. Additional new investors are also expected to join this financing round shortly to reach the EUR150 million level. The IoT space opens up new and exciting opportunities by connecting the physical world to the Internet. With its global network, Sigfox gives a voice to billions of objects, allowing them to play a pivotal role in our social and economic development. In just five years, Sigfox has built a unique global wireless network that provides a simple, efficient connectivity solution, enabling devices to connect to the cloud at ultra low-cost and using minimal energy. No other network than Sigfox's has a worldwide footprint and can claim to connect fully autonomous energy harvesting objects. Thanks to Sigfox, every object will connect to the cloud at minimal cost, by relying only on the surrounding energy sources. This promise, along with the significant developments made by the company over the past 18 months, have contributed to the successful closing of this round of funding. With more than 10 million objects registered on its network and coverage currently spanning 26 countries, Sigfox is reinforcing its position as a global leader in the IoT space. This new round of funding will enable the company to expand its international network to 60 countries by 2018 and reach financial breakeven point. The company sees Industry 4.0 [http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/manufacturings-next-act ] as one of the main growth paths driving the development of the IoT. The need for predictive maintenance as well as the continued evolution of its business model towards more services could be some of the reasons behind Total's decision to join other shareholders supporting Sigfox's international development. "We are happy to accompany the development of Sigfox because the technology it offers can be decisive to accelerate the deployment of the Internet of things. It is their advance acquired on the market in a short time and their capacity to accelerate the deployment of large-scale IoT solutions that motivated our investment", commented Patrick Pouyanne, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Total. "This type of solution will improve the performance and operational safety of industrial activities, reduce operating costs, but also be used to serve customers " Another key opportunity is the optimisation of industrial processes leveraging big data. For this reason, Sigfox plans to integrate with Salesforce's IoT Cloud, unlocking insights from the connected world that empower any business to take the right action, for the right customer, at the right time across global consumer and business use cases. By connecting billions of objects and events, Sigfox and Salesforce IoT Cloud can facilitate deep and meaningful customer experiences via its global, homogenous and scalable network. Intel Capital, Idinvest Partners and IXO PE, which are historical shareholders of Sigfox, actively participated in this round. "We strongly believe that Sigfox has unlocked the IoT connectivity bottleneck and will bring billions of objects online in the near future. Its cost effective, easy to use, open platform solution is set to become the standard for low power object connectivity, bringing massive productivity gains to the corporate world and everyday benefits to end customers", said Franck Tuil, Elliott's Senior Portfolio Manager.  "I created Parrot 22 years ago, and I know how much it takes to carry out ambitious projects on a large scale. I am impressed by the huge progress made by Sigfox over the last three years I have spent as a member of Sigfox's board of directors. I am now convinced of the colossal growth potential of the market Sigfox successfully addresses. Alongside the financial investment I am making today in the company, I am willing to provide Sigfox's management with my support as an entrepreneur", said Henri Seydoux, CEO of Parrot. "The Internet of Things is one of the next big transformational technologies, and we are proud to support Sigfox as the infrastructure leader. We are pleased to see a strong startup ecosystem being built around this world-class technology.", said Paul Francois Fournier, Executive Director of Bpifrance. Commenting on the announcement, Xavier Drilhon, deputy CEO of Sigfox said, "I joined Sigfox 18 months ago because of the incredibly powerful vision of its founders and the unique positioning of the company as a fundamental enabler of the IoT revolution. Our rapid international expansion made possible thanks to the support of our local operators, as well as the growth of our ecosystem, were key to securing this new fundraising. This will allow the company to accelerate the deployment of its network from 26 countries today to over 60 within the next two years, representing 90 per cent of the worldwide GDP." "When we met in 2010, we agreed that Sigfox could change the world by bringing the virtual and physical worlds together through a new paradigm based on the fundamental principles of astrophysics. Today, we have created the equivalent of the world's largest radio telescope for IoT. Our network is able to connect hundreds of billions of objects to the Internet through advanced radio techniques." said Ludovic Le Moan and Christophe Fourtet, co-founders of Sigfox. The round comprises a "greenshoe" that will allow new strategic and financial partners to join the share capital of Sigfox shortly. Lazard and Goldman Sachs acted as financial advisors to Sigfox, with Skadden acting as legal advisor and Callisto acting as financial advisors to the management.

Cade Metz Business Date of Publication: 11.18.16. 11.18.16 Time of Publication: 6:30 am. 6:30 am Intel Looks to a New Chip to Power the Coming Age of AI Getty Images Microsoft researchers recently built an artificially intelligent system that seems to recognize conversational speech as effectively as a human. Yes, this research comes with caveats, but it’s part of a very real and very rapid leap in artificial intelligence over the past several years, a leap driven by deep neural networks. These sweepingly complex algorithms can teach themselves very particular tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data. Microsoft’s system learned to recognize words by looking for patterns in old tech support calls. But it’s not just the algorithms that are driving the recent revolution in AI. It’s also the hardware behind these algorithms. Microsoft’s speech rec system relies on large farms of GPU processors, chips that were originally designed for rendering graphics but have proven remarkably adept at running artificial intelligence models. Related Stories Giant Corporations Are Hoarding the World’s AI Talent What the AI Behind AlphaGo Can Teach Us About Being Human Inside OpenAI, Elon Musk’s Wild Plan to Set Artificial Intelligence Free Internet giants like Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and Baidu typically train their deep neural nets using GPUs. But they’re moving towards other, more specialized chips that can help accelerate not just the training but the execution of these systems. Google recently built its own AI processor. IBM is building another. So Intel, the world’s largest chip maker, is doing the same. Yesterday, the company unveiled a new AI processor called Nervana, saying it plans on testing prototypes by the middle of next year, and if all goes well, a finished chip will come to market by the end of 2017. At the moment, the market for AI chips is dominated by nVidia, the primary supplier of GPUs. But Intel is pushing to be a big part of this potentially enormous market in the years to come. The new chip is based on technology originally built by a startup Intel acquired earlier this year, also called Nervana. “This really is the industry’s first purpose-built silicon for artificial intelligence,” says Intel corporate vice president Jason Waxman, who oversees the chips the company sells for big data centers like those operated by Google and Microsoft, explaining why the chip maker acquired the startup. That claims leaves out Google’s TPU chip, IBM’s True North, and perhaps others. But the Google chip isn’t a commercial product—it’s only used inside Google data centers—and the IBM chip has yet to reach the market, with some top AI researchers questioning whether it’s suited to deep learning. In any event, the race is on to create the chips that will power an AI-dominated future. Two Stages Deep neural networks operate in two stages. First comes the training stage: a company like Microsoft feeds a neural net data that will enable it to perform a particular task, like speech recognition. Then comes the execution stage, when people actually use the neural net to, say, recognize commands spoken into smartphones. Intel’s Nervana chip is designed to help with both stages, says Nervana founder Navene Rao, now an Intel vice president and general manager. The chip is also designed to work not just with one type of deep neural networks, but with many. “We can boil neural networks down to a very small number of primitives, and even within those primitives, there are only a couple that matter,” Rao says, meaning that just a few fundamental hardware ideas can drive a wide range of deep learning services. Related Video President Barack Obama on How Artificial Intelligence Will Affect Jobs Today, GPUs are still the most effective way of training AI systems, while companies are exploring all sorts of hardware for execution. Baidu executes with help from GPUs, for instance, while Microsoft uses programmable chips called FPGAs. Google went so far as to design its own chip, the TPU. But GPUs—originally design for other purposes—are far from ideal. “They just happen to be what we have,” says Sam Altman, president of the tech accelerator Y Combinator and co-chairman of open-source AI lab OpenAI. And not everyone has the resources to program their own chips, much less design them from scratch. That’s where a chip like Nervana comes in. The question is how effective it will be. “We have zero details here,” says Patrick Moorhead, the president and principal analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy, a firm that closely follows the chip business. “We just don’t know what it will do.” But Altman, for one, is bullish on Intel’s technology. He was an investor in Nervana when it was a startup. “Before that experience, I was skeptical that startups were going to play a really big role in designing new AI,” he told me last week, even before Intel announced its new chip. “Now I have become much more optimistic.” Intel certainly gives this technology an added boost. Intel chips powered the rise of PC and the data center machines that serve up the modern Internet. It has the infrastructure needed to build chips at scale. It has the sales operation needed to push them into the market. And after years as the world’s dominant maker of data center chips, it has the leverage needed to get these chips inside the Internet’s biggest players. Intel missed the market for smartphone chips.

The company developing new chips to drive AI capabilities in everything from smart factories and drones to sports, fraud detection and autonomous cars. Intel had acquired AI startup Nervana in August this year and now the company is giving more details about where it will include Nervana’s tech into the product roadmap. Intel will test first silicon (code-named “Lake Crest”) in the first half of 2017 and will make it available to key customers later in the year. In addition, Intel announced a new product (code-named “Knights Crest”) on the roadmap that tightly integrates Intel Xeon processors with the technology from Nervana. Lake Crest is optimized specifically for neural networks to deliver the highest performance for deep learning and offers unprecedented compute density with a high-bandwidth interconnect. Diane Bryant, executive vice president and general manager of the Data Center Group at Intel said that before the end of the decade, Intel will deliver a 100-fold increase in performance that will turbocharge the pace of innovation in the emerging deep learning space. Bryant also announced that Intel expects the next generation of Intel Xeon Phi processors (code-named “Knights Mill”) will deliver up to 4x better performance than the previous generation for deep learning and will be available in 2017. In addition, Intel announced it is shipping a preliminary version of the next generation of Intel Xeon processors (code-named “Skylake”) to select cloud service providers. Intel also sells FPGAs (field programmable gate arrays), which are circuits that can reprogrammed to do specific tasks. Intel wants to put FPGAs in servers, autonomous cars, robots, and drones. Intel next year will ship the Deep Learning Inference Accelerator, an FPGA that competes with inferencing chips like Google’s Tensor Processing Unit. Intel also announced Intel Nervana AI Academy which will track three groups viz, Academia, Professionals, and Startups. The Academy will host meetups, offer onsite, online and event based training, plus an ongoing expansion of enablement activities.

To others, it’s commonplace.  In reality, the process of overclocking either your CPU or GPU is simple and safe. Best of all, it can provide a significant performance boost. There are, however, a few concerns you should consider when overclocking your CPU. Here is a guide to show you the ins and outs of CPU overclocking, and how to do so in a calm and safe manner. A (Very) Brief Overview of CPU Overclocking The clock in overclock refers to the clock speed of a computer component. Clock speed is indicated in Hz (Hertz), and dictates the general speed of a component. A slew of other factors determine the actual speed of your PC. Among others, that includes CPU cores, cache size, and generation. The latest gen CPUs are also much more efficient than older models. Moreover, CPU limitations are defined by external components, such as motherboard and cooler. Should I Overclock? The tech enthusiast in me wants to say “Why haven’t you overclocked your PC already?” There is, however, a method to the madness of overclocking and a variety of factors to consider. Unlocked Clock Speed Certain Intel and AMD CPUs support unlocked clock multiplier. This function allows you to increase your clock speed by changing your clock multiplier (more on this below). A few examples of unlocked CPUs are AMD’s FX Series and Intel’s K series. These are not the only CPUs which support overclocking. To be clear: clock speed is a changeable parameter in any CPU, but it is often limited by your BIOS How To Enter The BIOS On Your Computer How To Enter The BIOS On Your Computer Inside the BIOS you can change basic computer settings, like the boot order. The exact key you need to strike depends on your hardware. We have compiled a list of strategies & keys to enter... Read More . CPUs with unlocked clock multipliers also allow for better voltage control, clock speed control, and overclock software support. What may not be worth the extra effort, is attempting to overclock your locked CPU by flashing a different BIOS versions, upping your stock fan RPM, slapping an extra fan in your case, and pushing the limits of your non-optimized motherboard. Rule number one of PC tweaking: understand and accept the limits of your hardware. CPU Cooler One of the reasons CPU overclocking is less popular than GPU overclocking How to Safely Overclock Your GPU to Gain FPS How to Safely Overclock Your GPU to Gain FPS Overclocking can make your PC perform at clock speeds one generation above its release. If done right, it's safe and easy. We'll show you how to get a GPU performance boost for free. Read More is cooling. GPUs come equipped with their own heat dissipating and cooling technology. This allows users to overclock their GPUs without having to worry about overheating the component. Image Credit: MSI.com CPUs do not provide the same level of cooling How to Prevent Computer Overheating & Keep Your PC Cool How to Prevent Computer Overheating & Keep Your PC Cool Overheating computers may lead to unexpected shutdowns, lost data, and hardware damage. We'll show you how to read computer temperatures and simple ways to keep your PC cool. Read More at stock. We don’t recommend stock coolers, even under regular CPU loads. Once users begin experimenting with CPU voltage, temperatures can increase exponentially. This is why an upgraded CPU cooler is not only helpful, but downright necessary, when it comes to legitimate CPU overclocks. Yet, with a careful eye, respectable CPU overclocks using stock coolers are achievable. Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO - CPU Cooler with 120mm PWM Fan (RR-212E-20PK-R2) Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO - CPU Cooler with 120mm PWM Fan (RR-212E-20PK-R2) Well-balanced cooling performance provides fin optimizations with perfect balance between high and low speed operations Buy Now At Amazon $23.75 Turbo Boost/Core Technology Let’s say you have an Intel Core i5 4460 processor in your PC, and you’d like to squeeze a little more juice out of your processor. I know my i5 4460 has a base clock of 3.2 GHz, so maybe I’ll attempt to increase it to 3.3 GHz. There’s only one problem. The CPU already runs at that speed. How? Through a piece of technology called Turbo Boost for Intel CPUs and Turbo Core for AMD CPUs. Turbo Boost or Core operate by adjusting clock speed dynamically, allowing for more performance of a single CPU core when under load. This means the base clock of your CPU may be 3.20 GHz, but can perform at a higher clock speed. Keep this in mind if you’re only thinking of adjusting clock speeds slightly; you may not even need to! Danger! High Voltage Overclocking is more an art than a science. First, the user increases the clock speed. This first process will, in itself, increase the heat of your CPU. Once you hit a stability limit, the dance isn’t over. You’ll need to increase the voltage to match the performance increase of your clock speed. A lapse in judgement concerning CPU core voltage How Undervolting Decreases Heat & Increases Battery Life How Undervolting Decreases Heat & Increases Battery Life Would you believe that many computers and smartphones can run cooler and consume less power? A trick exists, called undervolting, which can increase your CPU's efficiency with few drawbacks. If performed right, devices generally produce... Read More is the main cause of worry with overclocking. Voltage, unlike clock speed, hinges on both the power capacity of your CPU and the voltage capabilities of your motherboard. Since your motherboard supplies the power to your CPU, you must ensure that your motherboard can handle the load. Gigabyte, for example, has an Overclocking motherboard series built to handle higher voltage loads than otherwise. They also provide durability rating to ensure said capabilities. The same is not true for all motherboards, so err on the side of caution when adjusting voltage settings for your CPU. Standard Overclock The problem with standardizing overclock settings is the large range of flexibility with overclock speeds. Stable overclock speeds don’t just range from generation to generation. They range from CPU to CPU. That’s why a standard overclock which works for all CPUs is impossible to find. The only way to truly overclock your CPU is to modify parameters, stress-test, rinse, and repeat. Image Credit: JK Brickworks The process may become fairly tedious, especially if you’ve never overclocked before. I would advise you take your time, and not rush the process. After all, even a slight overclock will provide you speeds you otherwise wouldn’t have. Overclocking: A First-Hand Guide The purpose of this article is not to explain the relationship your CPU has to the rest of your computer. The aim here is to provide a step by step walk-through to overclocking your PC. Remember, you can always benefit from learning What Is A Processor Core? [MakeUseOf Explains] What Is A Processor Core? [MakeUseOf Explains] Every computer has a processor, whether it's a small efficiency pro or a large performance powerhouse, or else it wouldn't be able to function. Of course, the processor, also called the CPU or Central Processing... Read More more about the inner workings of your PC. Overclocking Terms and Parameters Certain terms are vital for overclocking purposes. BCLK (Base Clock or Frequency) refers to the base speed (in Hertz, or cycles per second) of your processor. Overall clock speed does not occur in a chunk. Instead, your CPU (along with your RAM) runs in clock cycles, often referred to as its frequency. Most base clock run at 100 MHz. The overall speed of your CPU is indicated by the base clock multiplied by the clock multiplier. The Clock Multiplier is the main parameter you will change during overclock. This parameter dictates the general speed of your CPU. For example, a BCLK speed of 100 MHz and a clock multiplier setting of 32 will have an overall clock speed of 3.2 GHz or 3200 MHz. VCore, the CPU core voltage. When you are overclocking your PC, ensure that your are modifying your core voltage (as opposed to DRAM voltage, for example). You can check this parameter using monitoring software like HWMonitor or CPU-Z. At first, don’t modify VCore. After you’ve hit a snag with stability, begin increasing your voltage by tenths (.10s). The moment your PC crashes due to a VCore parameter change, switch it back. Overclocking With Software Both Intel and AMD provide official overclocking software to ease the process: Intel Extreme Tuning Utility (ETU) and AMD OverDrive. The software works as a bridge between your hardware and your overclock. I recommend these software choices for users just starting out with component overclocking. They provide an easy-to-use interface, live monitoring software, and necessary parameter limits to stop you from doing anything rash. If you already have benchmarking programs How to Benchmark Your CPU and GPU Like a Pro How to Benchmark Your CPU and GPU Like a Pro Benchmarking allows users to gauge hardware performance, troubleshoot issues, and compare system setups.

The exact key you need to strike depends on your hardware. We have compiled a list of strategies & keys to enter... Read More than the ones of yester-year. Before, BIOS options were text based and provided minimal information regarding changeable variables. Today’s BIOS settings are more informative and useful. BIOS settings differ from model to model. Search for your motherboards manual online to match the instructions below with your BIOS’ equivalent. Search for the overclock settings in your BIOS. Since I am using an MSI motherboard, I will be using the MSI BIOS screen. Older BIOS versions will not include a clickable BIOS, but will often support the same parameter changes. One thing to notice before entering your overclock (OC) settings. On the top left-hand corner of the screen, you’ll see a button labeled OC Genie. OC Genie is unique to MSI motherboards, and it is an example of a canned overclock feature present in some BIOS options. Canned overclocks promise better performance with the push of a button. To be clear: OC Genie does its job. It will overclock your CPU. Yet, the ease does come at a price. OC Genie will spike your voltage higher, thereby heating your component more than necessary. Also, it doesn’t efficiently gauge your clock speed. I recommend you go the route of trial and error, rather than place your overclock in OC Genie’s hands. The same goes for other canned overclock programs. Click on the OC button of your BIOS to access your overclock settings. You will note that my OC settings are missing a key parameter: VCore or Voltage. Compare this BIOS with the following. Using a Gaming motherboard, i.e. one designed for overclocking, like the Z87 series from MSI and/or an unlocked CPU, will provide a wider range of overclocking capabilities. Locked processors, in conjunction with optimized BIOS versions, will limit the parameters you can change. The general practice of overclocking, however, does not change from CPU to CPU. If you have a locked CPU, either roll back your BIOS or use an unlocked processor to enable default voltage settings. Step 1: Disable Turbo Boost / Core. You can do so by mousing over the Turbo Boost / Core parameter and clicking Disable. Since Turbo Boost and Core create an offset with voltage and CPU ratio, it is difficult to test the raw stability of any given overclock. The same goes for disabling any canned overclocking programs like OC Genie. Step 2: Locate your CPU Ratio. Don’t confuse this with Base or Adjusted frequency. Your CPU ratio is a two-digit parameter which, when multiplied by your Base Frequency, creates your adjusted CPU Frequency. This number indicates the general speed of your CPU. Adjust this parameter by single-digits, i.e. a 33 CPU Ratio to 34. If, after stress-testing, your PC crashes, lower the parameter. There is a trick to changing BIOS parameters. The [Auto] parameter gives a preset list of choices to choose from, or much enter your own parameter into the list. The Auto parameter, on the other hand, indicates that you can enter a numerical value. To change, mouse-over the parameter and type in your value. Most users click on this parameter to no avail. You must enter the value yourself. You can also change this setting by using the + / – keyboard commands. If a value you enter automatically reverts to a lesser value, your CPU is locked. Step 3: If you hit a ceiling with your CPU Ratio, begin increasing your default voltage by .025 V. Stress-test and repeat until you hit a bump in stability. Do not scale your voltage wildly. Voltage caps hinge on multiple aspects of your rig, including CPU sockets and motherboard capabilities. This makes voltage changes the most dangerous parameter to modify. If you start slow and ensure a thorough stress-test, you have nothing to worry about. How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love My BIOS There is a tendency to think overclocking a PC requires that the user study huge tomes regarding Computer Engineering. Overclocking, as has been shown, amounts to a little more than slightly opening the gates of power from your CPU. Have no fear, proceed safely and unlock the potential of your CPU!

LAKE CITY, Nov. 17, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Inspur released a report at the 2016 Global Supercomputing Conference (SC16) sharing the latest developments and applications of the KEEP program. The KEEP program (Knights Landing Evaluation and Escalation Program) is a pilot program jointly launched this past June by Inspur and Intel – based on Intel's new generation many-core processor, Knights Landing (KNL). In the KEEP program, Inspur and Intel jointly established an open and high-performance computing system based on brand-new KNL technology. During the first stage, a KNL testing system with a calculation capacity of over 200 TFlops was built – expandable to 700 TFlops later to help more high-performance computing and deep-learning users to accomplish application tests, transfers and optimization for the KNL. As presented at the conference, many users from different fields are deeply involved in the KEEP program – from traditional high-performance computing areas, such as oceanographic simulation, fluid mechanics computing, astronomical data processing and oil exploration, to new emerging fields such as HPDA – a combination of high-performance computing, big data, and intelligent computing, etc. Several KEEP program user experiences show that KNL is not only the most powerful many-core computer processor, it is also programming-friendly. Additionally, the basic performance reaches at least twice that of a dual-socket E5-2680 v4 CPU even without code level deep optimization. There is even more room to improve the performance when code-level deep optimization is performed specifically for the structural characteristics, or for the application algorithms of the KNL. KNL will continue to greatly improve the application of high-performance computing, deep learning, intelligent computing and big data applications, and a growing number of future applications will apply KNL to achieve better performance. The large number of realistic and reliable HPC application optimization experiences gathered via the KEEP program will undoubtedly contribute to the acceleration of the broader application and popularization of KNL.

Source: GlobalFoundries Workers at GlobalFoundries' Fab 8 chip factory in Malta. Source: GlobalFoundries GlobalFoundries travels to Oregon to fill Fab 8 jobs 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Malta GlobalFoundries has been active in the Portland, Ore., area trying to hire former Intel workers who were laid off by the computer chip giant last spring, according to the Oregonian newspaper. The new workers are for GlobalFoundries' Fab 8 computer chip factory in Saratoga County. The idea would have been inconceivable 10 years ago when the Capital Region looked to the Portland area as a model for what it wanted to achieve with its dreams to build its own semiconductor manufacturing hub. Intel, which is based in Silicon Valley, has 19,500 employees in Hillsboro outside of Portland. The company laid off 784 in April, according to the newspaper, as part of a massive layoff of 12,000 workers worldwide announced around the same time. GlobalFoundries has 3,000 employees at Fab 8 and has another 5,000 people between two former IBM chip fabs in Vermont and in Dutchess County. GlobalFoundries doesn't compete directly with Intel because it makes chips for other companies like Advanced Micro Devices, which created GlobalFoundries as a spin-off in 2009. Experienced semiconductor engineers are difficult to find in upstate New York because there is no history of semiconductor manufacturing, forcing GlobalFoundries to search across the U.S. and the world for people. A GlobalFoundries spokesman told the Oregonian that it hired 15 development engineers from the Portland area in July and is holding more job fairs in December to try to hire 80 technicians. Lately, Fab 8 has been able to produce chips for AMD that have out-performed Intel's best chip, an indication that the manufacturing operation at Fab 8 may be the best in the world. lrulison@timesunion.com • 518-454-5504 • @larryrulison Today's Deals Powered by SHOP NOW Gillette Mach3 Turbo Rogue Shave Set for $10 + pickup at Walmart WalmartPosted 25 min ago SHOP NOW FragranceNet Sale: 50% off or more + 30% off + free shipping...

MacBook Pro Complaint That Makes No Sense Apple's new MacBook Pro systems have been controversial, but this criticism doesn't hold water. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 17, 2016 at 8:20PM Developer Alexey Semeney recently wrote a blog entry titled "New MacBook Pro is not a Laptop for Developers Anymore." In the article, Semeney lists several reasons why Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) new MacBook Pro computers aren't compelling to the development community (i.e., programmers). Image source: Apple. Of the complaints, one stood out, as it made absolutely no sense. Let's take a closer look. Have processors not gotten any faster? Here's Semeney (ellipses are in original): The MacBook Pro had options with 2.4 gigahertz dual-core processors back in 2010. Anything new in 2016? Not really, well... nope. The implication here is that the processors inside of Apple's latest MacBook Pro haven't improved much from the ones inside of the MacBook Pro machines being sold in 2010. That couldn't be further from the truth. The MacBook Pro has gotten much better The early 2010 13-inch MacBook Pro included a 2.4GHz dual-core Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Core 2 Duo P8600 processor. This chip was rated at a thermal design power of 25 watts, didn't include an integrated graphics processor, and required several support chipsets just to function properly. Compare that to the Core i5-6267U processor found in the base configuration of the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. The CPU, which is a dual-core chip with hyperthreading (meaning four virtual cores total), runs at 2.9GHz base and a maximum turbo speed of 3.3GHz. The chip includes a powerful integrated graphics processor (Intel Iris graphics), and requires only one support chipset to function (and that chipset is integrated onto the same package as the main processor). Further, the frequency measurement alone doesn't say much about the underlying performance of the system. Over the last several years, Intel has made substantial enhancements to its processor cores so that they can perform more work per given clock cycle, or per GHz. This means that even if Apple were to use modern (in the blogger's words) "2.4 gigahertz dual-core processors," they would be a lot faster than the processor that Apple used in its 2010 MacBook Pro computers. The combination of higher frequency and much improved performance-per-clock means that today's MacBook Pro systems are way faster than those from 2010. Indeed, per the popular Geekbench 4 CPU performance test, the baseline 13-inch MacBook Pro is more than twice as fast as the 2010 MacBook Pro in single-threaded CPU tasks, and nearly three times as fast in dual-core performance. Image source: Geekbench 4 Browser. The MacBook Pro has gotten better and faster Typical personal-computer replacement cycles are quite long, often about five to six years, according to Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. This suggests that the target audience for Apple's 2016 MacBook Pro computers is owners of personal computers (both Windows and Mac) purchased back in the 2010-2011 time frame. The improvements that Apple has brought to the table with its new systems, including processor performance, look as though they would be compelling to users of computers purchased five to six years ago. There may be legitimate criticisms of Apple's new MacBook Pro systems, particularly as they relate to software developers. However, I don't think the lack of a performance increase is something to knock Apple on, since both performance and power efficiency have gotten significantly better. At any rate, I remain optimistic that Apple's new MacBook Pro systems will do well in the marketplace, despite the complaints. Investors will be able to get a better handle on how these systems have been received by customers as Apple reports its Mac shipment and revenue figures over the next several quarters.

All rights reserved Terms of use Privacy Sitemap The Intercept_ f t ✉ ⎕ 15 Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty Images Turkish Client Paid Trump Adviser Michael Flynn’s Company “Tens of Thousands” of Dollars for Lobbying Mattathias Schwartz Mattathias Schwartz 2016-11-17T23:53:14+00:00 Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty Images Donald Trump has repeatedly promised to “drain the swamp” of Washington corruption. The new ethics pledge he announced Wednesday would prohibit registered lobbyists from working for his transition team or administration. But Trump’s supposed aversion to lobbyists has not harmed the fortunes of Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, one of Trump’s earliest and most visible supporters, now a vice chair of the transition team and a rumored frontrunner for the influential post of national security adviser. Though Flynn is not a lobbyist himself, his company, Flynn Intel Group, is registered with Congress as a lobbying organization, and has a registered lobbyist on its staff. A Flynn Intel Group client, Kamil Ekim Alptekin, a Turkish businessman with real estate, aerospace, and consulting interests, told The Intercept on Thursday that one of his companies, Inovo BV, paid Flynn’s company “tens of thousands of dollars” for analysis on world affairs. On election day, Flynn published an opinion piece for The Hill urging U.S. support for Turkey’s controversial strongman president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and pushing for the extradition of Erdogan’s political rival, Fethullah Gülen, who now resides in Pennsylvania. “From Turkey’s point of view, Washington is harboring Turkey’s Osama bin Laden,” Flynn wrote, on November 8. In a statement, Flynn said that he would sever ties with his own company if he entered Trump’s administration. He did not say whether he would close the business, where his son is listed as chief of staff, or disclose his other clients. Alptekin said that while he agreed with what Flynn wrote, he did not have any influence over his views. “There is no money in the world that could make Gen. Flynn or anybody else who is being considered for a cabinet post write that article on election day,” he said. “I don’t think a billion dollars would make him do that.” The ties between Flynn Intel Group and Inovo BV, Alptekin’s company, were previously reported by The Daily Caller and Politico. Robert Kelley, the Flynn Group’s general counsel and the main point of contact with the Inovo account, told Politico that the company’s duties included reporting on “the present situation, the transition between President Obama and President-elect Trump.” Alptekin said that was “absolutely untrue. We never had a single conversation on that issue.” He told The Intercept that he hired Flynn Intel Group “three months ago.” He said he knew of Flynn’s relationship with President-elect Trump, but that had no bearing on his decision to become a client. “It was more his reputation for integrity, and as a decorated war hero who knows the region,” he said. “I didn’t work with him directly. I never discussed the [election day] article with him directly. I didn’t sign off on the article.” While Alptekin says the payments were not for lobbying, Flynn Intel Group is registered as a lobbyist for Inovo BV, a Dutch company controlled by Alptekin. Flynn Intel Group had not registered as a lobbying entity until September. That month, Kelley, the company’s general counsel, registered as a lobbyist for Inovo BV. (A third filing, from late October, identifies a government relations company called SGR LLC as lobbying Congress on behalf of the Flynn Intel Group.) Earlier 2016 filings with the Department of Justice from Kelley’s law office identify him as an agent of the National Mobilization Forces, an Iraqi military group trained by the Turkish government and controlled by the former governor of Nineveh province. The filings show that Kelley received a total of $90,000 from the Iraqi group and terminated the relationship in June. Alptekin, a Turkish citizen who worked on Capitol Hill as a congressional fellow in 2003, confirmed that Inovo BV, his Dutch company, was a current client of Flynn Intel Group. “I don’t know him so well, but I met him a few times,” he said, of Gen. Flynn. “In general, when [Flynn] meets someone from the region, he ends up talking about the danger of radical Islam. He mentioned that radical Islam in Turkey is no different from other radical Islamic leaders in the past, with a different front face, a different back office. He compared Gülen to Ayatollah Khomeini. I remember that of the talking points he discussed with me. But I never said ‘go out and say this and do that.’” “Mr. Flynn does not work on my contract,” he added. “Mr. Bob Kelley does.” Neither Flynn nor the Trump transition team responded to requests for comment. Reached by phone on Thursday afternoon, Kelley read a three-sentence statement which he said had been prepared by Flynn. “Our counsel, Bob Kelley, registered pursuant to law for our company to represent the interests of a private company,” the statement read, in part. It continued: “If I return to government service, my relationship with my company will be severed in accordance with the policy announced by President-elect Trump.” Kelley declined to say whether the Flynn Intel Group had any foreign governments as clients. When asked whether Flynn’s son Michael, whose LinkedIn profile has him as Flynn’s “chief of staff,” would continue to have a role at the firm should his father move on to the White House, Kelley declined to respond. “I can’t give you more than what’s in the statement,” he said.

It succeeds the 8th generation "Cannon Lake" family of notebook processors (which likely doesn't see a desktop launch), and the 7th Gen Core "Kaby Lake" socket LGA1151 processors slated for January 2017. While it's not known if mainstream desktop "Coffee Lake" chips will continue to be based on the LGA1151 socket, the possibility is diminishing, looking at a platform layout diagram leaked to the web by Benchlife.info, supported by new connectivity interfaces coming out of the CPU package. The biggest selling-point of "Coffee Lake," is its core-count. The 9th generation Core "Coffee Lake" family could introduce Intel's first 6-core processor to the mainstream desktop platform. The company's first 6-core client part was launched in its LGA1366 HEDT (high-end desktop) platform with the Core i7 "Gulftown" processor, way back in 2010. An increase in core-count from 4 has eluded the mainstream-desktop lineup. The 6-core "Coffee Lake" silicon will be built on a highly-refined 14 nm node by Intel, with a die-size of 149 mm². Quad-core parts won't be carved out of this silicon by disabling two cores, but rather be built on a smaller 126 mm² die. For reference, the quad-core "Kaby Lake" die is expected to be 123 mm², and the current quad-core "Skylake-D" die measures 122.6 mm².

Anyways, I guess with Coffee Lake they are just replacing the GPU with two extra cores? I wonder if it will be super expensive, or whether the 'E' processors will come down in price when you can get a 'mainstream' 6-core from Intel.

As soon as the iPhone 7 was released users began notice a difference in download speeds between the Verizon iPhone 7 which features a Qualcomm MDM9645M LTE modem and the AT&T version which has an Intel XMM7360 modem. Cellular Insights performed tests which concluded that the average performance delta between the two is in the 30% range in favor of the Qualcomm variant. Recently, Bloomberg reported on testing by Twin Prime which determined that although the Verizon model is faster than the Intel model, it still is not as fast as it could be. The Samsung Galaxy S7 which also uses the Qualcomm X12 was about twice as fast as the iPhone 7 running on the same network with the same modem chip. “The data indicates that the iPhone 7 is not taking advantage of all of Verizon’s network capabilities,” said Gabriel Tavridis, head of product at Twin Prime. “I doubt that Apple is throttling each bit on the Verizon iPhone, but it could have chosen to not enable certain features of the network chip.” Now, sources tell Re/code that it's true, Apple has limited the speed of the Qualcomm modem in the Verizon iPhone 7 to make it perform at about the same speed as the Intel modem. Apple supposedly did this for a simple reason: It wanted the cost savings and flexibility of having two chip sources but also wanted the different versions of the phone to be as similar as possible (to avoid angering AT&T and T-Mobile and their customers in the U.S., for example). Apple's official comment on the matter: “Every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple’s wireless performance standards, quality metrics, and reliability testing,” Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said. “In all of our rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards, in thousands of hours of real-world field testing, and in extensive carrier partner testing, the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models."

It's both sad and disgusting at the same time. If he isn't stopped, the MacBook will become no better than the PC and the iPhone will become no better than an Android. Or maybe it's already to that point, but as an avid Apple supporter for so many years, I just don't want to see or believe it. What's next, Tim? Bastardize OS X (macOS) as well? Make it installable on all platforms just so you can get more money? He is destroying the brand that was once so great. Something needs to be done to stop him before it's too late, if it isn't already. I have never disliked anyone as much as I dislike Tim Cook. To destroy something that was so wonderful, beautiful and cherished by so many for the sake of revenue...no....GREED is atrocious.

Forgot to Mention thing about this article they do not mention that I forgot to put in the last comment is that they disable !!! !!

Maybe possibly we might see them slowing the operating speed down to the iPhone 2G A.k.a. Known as that iPhone 1 It's hard to even load a webpage or a YouTube video on LTE you can forget about it Apple needs to stop screwing over their customers and give people what they want and do not sell different models with different chips of iPhones But I think there's a more point to this why did they choose to use these phones AT&T and T-Mobile is it because they did not want their services roaming on other networks therefore they do not have to pay the networks that they are roaming on Therefore AT&T and T-Mobile saving money What's really going on ??????

Last year Currys had some deals in advance, but also added more on Black Friday itself, so it's well worth checking online to make sure that you're not missing out on the big day. Currys is arguably the best place to go for TV deals, and those made up the majority of things it was discounting last year. The classic coffee machine discounts are in effect too, so don't be buying any machinery in advance this year. "This year Black Friday hits on November 25 - be there or be square" Last year Currys even made sure that it avoided those problems of stock shortages, and people shouting at superstores by ramping up stock levels by 40%, which says a lot about the growth of Black Friday in the UK. Even so, don't miss out and make sure you check for deals early on the day - we'll be here to make that easier too.  What Currys did on Black Friday last year: During the run-up to last year's sale Currys' Stuart Ramage said "We saw record-breaking sales last Black Friday so, for this year’s event we’ve worked hard to offer our biggest number of lowest-ever deals on a range of fantastic brands, starting today". This was clear from the claim that Currys made about increasing stock levels to meet demand. For customers this is a great time to snag a bargain, but it's also becoming a really important part of the retailer calendar too, which is why they are investing in promoting the event.  Top 5 Currys Black Friday deals from 2015: 1. HP 15-ac151sa 15.6-inch This decent laptop was going for just £200 at Currys last Black Friday - if you're old like us then you'll remember when laptops cost thousands - great deal on a nicely specified machine that comes with Windows 10 2. Samsung 60-inch 4K TV This home cinema telly was on sale for just £899 at Currys last Black Friday, another reminder of just how cheap tech is these days, but one of Samsung's HDR UHD TVs is a great buy at this price. 3. iPad Pro 12.9 Currys also had a nice iPad Pro price drop last Black Friday, down to £799 - not the world's most enormous discount, but the iPad Pro is a great tablet and Apple discounts are rare. At the time it was the cheapest iPad Pro deal out there. 4. Blenders! Because 2015 was the year of juice, Currys was selling the NINJA Nutri Ninja Slim QB3001 Blender for £39, which was half-price. This year you can certainly expect loads of deals on kitchen goods like blenders and bread makers. 5. Dyson Animal Another great deal was the Dyson V6 Animal, a cable-free vacuum cleaner that was reduced to just £239 - over £100 off! Dysons are great but they're generally very pricey, which makes Black Friday the ideal time of year to buy one.  Currys  Black Friday deals to expect in 2016: 1. TVs, all the TVs. Expect to see even more deals on those large ultra HD Samsung screens again as well as from all of the other big TV brands. If you're looking for 60-inch entertainment, Currys will have your back. 2. Apple might upgrade the iPad Pro soon, so perhaps more discounts on the two excellent tablets this year? The fact is that iPad sales have slowed dramatically of late so some discounting is almost inevitable to move stock. 3. This year's washing machines will likely see a discount. Keep an eye out for those from Samsung and LG, which offer big features at a low price. Always shop around, obviously, but Currys will be a good place to check first on these ite 4. Last year Currys had big PC and laptop discounts, so expect more of that this year - this is a great time to grab a bargain. 5. If you're put off by the high cost of a Dyson, then Black Friday might be the ideal event - keep an eye out for more low prices on cleaners.  How to find the best Currys Black Friday deals:  It's our job to make sure you get told about the best deals. We do this across the UK's leading retailers,  so make sure you come back to TechRadar in advance of Black Friday. We'll be highlighting the best deals right here, so make sure you drop a bookmark.

Master Herald Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Menu Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Microsoft Surface Book 2 Release Date May Be Pushed Back to 2018 in Light of the Recent Release of the Hybrid Surface Book i7 Posted By: Arash FekriPosted date: November 20, 2016In: Technology Page 1 of 212» While there have been reports before the Microsoft event on October 26 that the next iteration of the company’s ultimate laptop line, the Surface Book, might be unveiled during the event along with the Surface Pro 5, it did not happen. The only thing that happened during the event was the release of the latest update to Windows 10 and the unveiling of the hybrid Surface Book i7. The hybrid Surface Book i7 is not as powerful as the rumored specifications, features, and capabilities of the Microsoft Surface Book 2 but it is certainly more than adequate to match up against the 2016 Apple MacBook Pro, which the American tech giant officially rolled out on October 27. If any, one positive thing that the hybrid Surface Book i7 did for the highly-anticipating fans of the Microsoft Surface Book 2 was to quench their thirst for the second iteration of the ultimate laptop line from the Redmondian company. Possible push back imminent However, some critics believe that the recent release of the hybrid Surface Book i7 might have pushed the release date of the Microsoft Surface Book 2 on the retail market. Accordingly, the Redmondian company would not field two similar products in the market at the same time since the Surface Book 2 would come off as a high-end variant of the hybrid Surface Book i7. But the two laptop lines would surely compete for the same market that also has the presence of the 2016 Apple MacBook Pro. As such, there are now talks that the release date of the Microsoft Surface Book 2 might be pushed back as far as 2018 since the demand for the original and the recently released hybrid Surface Book i7 remains high, notes Tech Radar. There are also rumors saying that Microsoft Surface Book 2 would come out early next year along with the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 since both devices shall be using the latest processor from Intel called Kaby Lake. To come with the most powerful processor from Intel As the next iteration of the 2-in-1 hybrid laptop/tablet, the Microsoft Surface Book 2 showcases some of the latest technologies. The Microsoft Surface Book 2 is expected to feature 4K resolution with 4K video and 3D graphics playback capability. Its battery may provide a running time of up to 16 hours, details Game & Guide. It can be recalled that the original device and the hybrid Surface Book i7 featured an Intel Core i7 processor so the Microsoft Surface Book 2 is expected to be faster and more powerful with its new chipset. It can improve graphic performance by 100% due to the 14-nanometer technology, which enhances the chipset by 12% compared to the Intel Skylake or the Intel Core i7 processors. The Microsoft Surface Book 2 is expected to have a 13.5-inch PixelSense display with a pixel resolution of 3000 x 2000 at 267 ppi. The device may include two full-size USB 3.0 ports, a full-size SD card reader, a mini display port and a headphone jack. The device may also feature a GeForce GTX 965M or GTX 1080 GPU, supported by an extra fan. Microsoft Surface Book 2 is said to arrive with a Surface Pen. There may also be a built-in dock to recharge the accessory. The exterior appearance of the ultimate laptop will most likely remain the same, which means that Microsoft will be focusing on the internal components of the new version. Microsoft may also push the Xbox Play Anywhere program via the Microsoft Surface Book 2. The Microsoft Surface Book 2 has been previously rumored to come out last month along with the Surface Pro 5. But that did not happen.

Automakers are engaged in a fierce race to develop the first driverless car, which experts say should hit the road by 2020. Apart from legal obstacles facing the industry as the technology evolves ― such as who is responsible in the event of an accident ― a digital battle is being waged over the huge amount of technical data that will be stored in such vehicles. “Data is the new oil,” Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich said this week during a speech at the Los Angeles auto show, AutoMobility LA. “If you have rich data, your car will be able to deal with complex route situations,” Krzanich said. “If not, the car will stop.” Sensors, radars and cameras on autonomous vehicles will be able to exchange data with other cars but also, perhaps, with “intelligent” roadways that can help set speed limits depending on weather and traffic conditions. The passenger behind the wheel, meanwhile, can send emails and text messages, listen to music, stream movies, hold a conference call or make a restaurant reservation. Even homes will be connected to vehicles. South Korean automaker Hyundai revealed at the auto show a partnership with Amazon’s Alexa voice service to allow customers to start their car, charge their battery or turn on the air conditioner via a quick voice request. Experts say the data stored in these vehicles represents a gold mine for companies. “Where are you, where you stop, how often, what’s in there can be used to provide you a rich user experience,” Krzanich said. “What music you like, craft choices... that’s an opportunity as well.” He said Intel was investing US$250 million (RM1.1 billion) into self-driving technology over the next two years. Karl Brauer, senior director of industry insights at Kelley Blue Book, said all the data collected will be used by car makers and other companies to maximise profit. “If they know you like to go to Starbucks (they will say) ‘Oh, he always stops at Starbucks,” Brauer said. Krzanich acknowledged that the technology posed great challenges in terms of privacy protection and secure sharing. CJ Frost, an Alexa executive, told a panel that consumers were heading into a world where applications will allow users, for example, to track down friends coming to dinner to ask them to stop on the way and buy a bottle of wine. Security concerns One question on many people’s mind is whether, in a world that could be edging closer to the Big Brother oversight of George Orwell’s dystopian novel 1984, it will be possible to disconnect at some point. “Consumer privacy is an open question,” said Jeremy Carlston, a senior analyst with IHS Automotive. “A smartphone holds a lot of info about the owner but when we provide that info to a service provider, we’re getting value in return,” he added. “It’s the same trade-off with an autonomous car.” Cyber-security was also the topic at a panel discussion during which speakers raised the issue of privacy. “Connected cars have added firewalls against hacking,” Egil Juliussen, director of research at IHS Automotive, told AFP. “Criminals could make the car inoperative and ask money to make it operate again.” In mid-2015, two American online-security researchers demonstrated how easily they could hack into a Jeep Cherokee, remotely taking control of the car’s functions, including its braking system. Krzanich said such challenges “will require the industry coming together and collaborating.” ― AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Drive Channel Most Viewed Now Week Edsel and 7 other automotive flops from history Compact MPV from Proton coming soon The China pull factor at the Guangzhou auto show (VIDEO) Autonomous cars ― ‘new oil’ or ‘big brother’?

Autonomous cars — ‘new oil’ or ‘big brother’? Friday 18th, November 2016 / 19:32 Written by Oman Observer in Features, Main Sensors, radars and cameras on autonomous vehicles will be able to exchange data with other cars but also, perhaps, with “intelligent” roadways that can help set speed limits depending on weather and traffic conditions. Veronique DUPONT – Just like credit cards, smartphones or search engines, autonomous cars will carry a trove of information about their owners as they make driving more comfortable, raising new concerns about privacy. Automakers are engaged in a fierce race to develop the first driverless car, which experts say should hit the road by 2020. Apart from legal obstacles facing the industry as the technology evolves — such as who is responsible in the event of an accident — a digital battle is being waged over the huge amount of technical data that will be stored in such vehicles. “Data is the new oil,” Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said this week during a speech at the Los Angeles auto show, AutoMobility LA. “If you have rich data, your car will be able to deal with complex route situations,” Krzanich said. “If not, the car will stop.” Sensors, radars and cameras on autonomous vehicles will be able to exchange data with other cars but also, perhaps, with “intelligent” roadways that can help set speed limits depending on weather and traffic conditions. The passenger behind the wheel, meanwhile, can send emails and text messages, listen to music, stream movies, hold a conference call or make a restaurant reservation. Even homes will be connected to vehicles. South Korean automaker Hyundai revealed at the auto show a partnership with Amazon’s Alexa voice service to allow customers to start their car, charge their battery or turn on the air-conditioner via a quick voice request. Experts say the data stored in these vehicles represents a gold mine for companies. “Where are you, where you stop, how often, what’s in there can be used to provide you a rich user experience,” Krzanich said. “What music you like, craft choices… that’s an opportunity as well.” He said Intel was investing $250 million into self-driving technology over the next two years. Karl Brauer, Senior Director of Industry Insights at Kelley Blue Book, said all the data collected will be used by car makers and other companies to maximize profit. “If they know you like to go to Starbucks (they will say) ‘Oh, he always stops at Starbucks,” Brauer said. Krzanich acknowledged that the technology posed great challenges in terms of privacy protection and secure sharing. CJ Frost, an Alexa Executive, told a panel that consumers were heading into a world where applications will allow users, for example, to track down friends coming to dinner to ask them to stop on the way and buy something. Security concerns One question on many people’s mind is whether, in a world that could be edging closer to the Big Brother oversight of George Orwell’s dystopian novel “1984,” it will be possible to disconnect at some point. “Consumer privacy is an open question,” said Jeremy Carlston, a senior analyst with IHS Automotive. “A smartphone holds a lot of info about the owner but when we provide that info to a service provider, we’re getting value in return,” he added. “It’s the same trade-off with an autonomous car.” Cyber-security was also the topic at a panel discussion during which speakers raised the issue of privacy. “Connected cars have added firewalls against hacking,” Egil Juliussen, Director of Research at IHS Automotive, said. “Criminals could make the car inoperative and ask money to make it operate again.” In mid-2015, two American online-security researchers demonstrated how easily they could hack into a Jeep Cherokee, remotely taking control of the car’s functions, including its braking system. Krzanich said such challenges “will require the industry coming together and collaborating.” — AFP About the author View all articles by Oman Observer ← El Salvador’s yellow-clad Rescue Corps Australian veteran Peter Senior calls it quits → ← Previous Next → Search Recent Posts Recent Council discusses role of OWA Red Arrows thrill Oman ‘Copper Land’ exhibition in Nizwa concludes Al Jin Cave is fifth largest in the world Read More ...

However the company’s efforts in mobile devices haven’t exactly been been considered successes, and it seems that in the wearables department, Intel could be considering bowing out as well. According to a report from TechCrunch, they have been told by their sources that the company could be stepping back from the wearables market, or even worse, exiting the wearables market entirely. Apparently the company has already informed their employees working in their wearables division about this which could result in some pretty huge layoffs by the end of the year. Some signs from earlier this year that Intel could be backing away include the recall of the Basis Peak wearables that were reported to have been overheating for some users. Instead of issuing replacements, Intel stopped selling the device entirely, and went ahead and announced that they would be shutting down the Peak’s software support by the end of the year. In any case it remains to be seen if these reports are true, but we guess we’ll have to wait and see what Intel has to say about it. In the meantime we guess if you are looking forward to more Intel wearables in the future, maybe don’t get your hopes up just yet. Filed in Gadgets >Rumors. Read more about Intel and Wearable Tech.

Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) on Friday praised Donald Trump’s decision hours earlier to pick Rep. Mike Pompeo (R., Kan.) to be the next CIA director, calling Pompeo “bright” and a “solid pick.” MSNBC anchor Andrea Mitchell asked Schiff, who works alongside Pompeo on the House Intelligence Committee as its ranking member, what he thought about the Kansas lawmaker’s ability to serve as CIA director if he is confirmed by the Senate. “I think Mike is a very bright guy. He’s hardworking. I think he understands the agency very well, so he’s a solid pick,” Schiff said. Schiff went on to say that Pompeo was partisan during the Benghazi Committee hearings, but he believes Pompeo can put partisanship aside for the CIA role. “I think he is a very capable choice, so of the three that came out today, I think he was the most solid pick,” Schiff said. Trump made two other key selections for top administration posts on Friday. He named Sen. Jeff Sessions (R., Ala.) to be his attorney general and retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn to be his national security adviser. Schiff was quite critical of Trump’s decision to give Flynn should an important national security role.

Monica Rizk AND Ron Meisels Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday, Nov. 18, 2016 8:15PM EST Last updated Friday, Nov. 18, 2016 8:15PM EST Comments AA Intel rallied from $23.50 (U.S.) to $37.90 in 2014 (A-B) and then settled into a bullish technical pattern called a “W” formation (dashed lines). The recent rise above the neckline of the pattern at ±$36 (dotted line) signalled a breakout and the start of a new major up-leg (C). Behaviour indicators including the 40-week Moving Average (40wMA) confirm the bullish status. Current price levels should provide a good entry level; only a sustained decline below ±$33 would be negative. Point & Figure measurements provide targets of $39 and $43. The large “W” pattern supports higher targets. Monica Rizk is the senior Technical Analyst and Ron Meisels is the president of Phases & Cycles Inc. (www.phases-cycles.com).

According to several user reports, users are claiming that instead of identifying the Intel HD Graphics 530 chipset that is supposed to be the integrated GPU in their laptop, the system is instead listing an Intel Iris Pro 580 GPU. Naturally this has led to confusion as some customers thought that they might have somehow gotten an upgrade. It also led to a bit of discontent as this inconsistency was also discovered on MacBook Pros shown off in Apple’s retail stores, leading some to believe that Apple was running higher-specced laptops that could potentially mislead customers, but thankfully that is not the case. According to a source of AppleInsider, this is simply a bug and that the innards and performance of the laptops that customers bought are as advertised. “The problem is a result of mistaken communication between the System Information developer team, and the hardware team. The [Intel HD Graphics] 530 is reporting to the OS right, it’s the System Information app database that’s leading users down the primrose path.” Apple has yet to acknowledge the bug and comment on it, and we have no idea when a fix will be issued to address this problem, but if you do see it when you check your MacBook Pro’s system information, you need not be alarmed.

This year it is being held at Oracle Arena in Oakland on Nov. 19 and Nov. 20 (ESL) By Gieson Cacho | gcacho@bayareanewsgroup.com PUBLISHED: November 18, 2016 at 4:49 pm | UPDATED: November 19, 2016 at 2:57 pm When it comes to e-sports, Dennis Fong considers himself patient zero — the first player to discover you can earn money playing video games. Before he ran services such as Plays.tv and Raptr, Fong (aka “Thresh”) was the world’s best “Doom” and “Quake” player. “From the money perspective … I was the first one making a living at doing” e-sports, he said in an interview, talking about growing up in Los Altos and becoming a professional gamer. As the field’s first star, he helped establish e-sports as an underground niche and now is helping make it a burgeoning part of the video game industry. Not only are e-sports televised today, but they regularly fill up venues used for NBA games — including Oracle Arena, where the Intel Extreme Masters event takes place this weekend. “The IEM is the big one in the Bay Area,” said Michal Blicharz, vice president of pro gaming at the Cologne, Germany-based ESL, which organizes these competitions worldwide and backs a top league. “It’s the biggest e-sports event in the Bay Area and the biggest ‘Counter-Strike’ event in California,” added Blicharz. Field reporter Kristine Leahy, center, speaks to billionaire Mark Cuban and Intel CEO Brian Krzanich at a “League of Legends” charity match at IEM San Jose in 2015. (ESL)  The IEM in Oakland features competitions in two games, “League of Legends” and “Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.” The first is a multiplayer online battle arena where two teams of five control virtual champions with a variety of abilities. The goal is to destroy the rival’s base. The draw of “League” is the strategizing involved as teams try to outmaneuver and defeat their opponents. Since its 2009 release, “League” has become one of the pre-eminent e-sports titles. “Counter-Strike,” introduced in 1999, also pairs off two teams of five people. One side represents terrorists guarding a bomb, the other counter terrorists intent on defusing it. This first-person shooter demands intricate team interaction. Matches become tense as one side picks off the other’s personnel until they are wiped out or the oposing team completes its objective. Last year’s IEM drew 9,000 to 10,000 people over two days at SAP Center in San Jose, according to Blicharz. It also featured a charity event where billionaire Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban played against Intel CEO Brian Krzanich in “League of Legends.” This year, said Blicharz, ESL is expecting a similar-size crowd, and it will also feature a twist on the Big Game as teams from Cal and Stanford duke it out in a “League” show match. As for the main competition, teams will battle for a $100,000 prize pot in “League of Legends” and $300,000 in “Counter-Strike.” With its mix of tech innovation and history, the Bay Area is one of the few places in the U.S. that have become competition hubs. Blicharz says historically Dallas has been an epicenter, while Southern California has drawn teams and events thanks to Riot Games, the “League of Legends” developer based in Santa Monica, and Blizzard, the developer of e-sports games such as “Hearthstone,” “StarCraft” and “Overwatch,” headquartered in Irvine. Seattle is a hub because of its proximity to gaming giant Valve, which hosts the International, a tournament for the popular game “Dota 2.” The Intel Extreme Masters drew 9,000 to 10,000 people a day when it was held at the SAP Center in San Jose in 2015. (ESL)  The Bay Area’s gravity stems from streaming giant Twitch and gaming and hardware companies, Blicharz said, including Electronic Arts (“Madden NFL”) and Capcom (Street Fighter”). In a training facility at Logitech’s U.S. headquarters in Newark, pro players from Team Solomid and Cloud 9 practice for up to 12 hours a day, according to Brent Barry, the company’s head of e-sports. Then there’s the region’s demographic. “Lots of young people — lots of young people interested in tech, this kind of tech — is integrated in this part of the country,” he said. “Events like these naturally fit.” Fong, who graduated from pro gamer to running companies that fuel interest video gaming, sees the same potential e-sports audience in the younger generation. “Today, I suspect if you were to talk to anyone under the age of 25, they would all know about e-sports,” he said. “It’s not mainstream yet, but anyone who has kids will see it.” INTEL EXTREME MASTERS When: Nov. 19 and 20, starting 9 a.m. Where: Oracle Arena, Oakland Ticket packages: $40-$160 Information: http://intelextrememasters.com/season11/oakland/     Tags:  Video Games Gieson Cacho Gieson Cacho is the video game columnist for the Bay Area News Group.

Here’s Intel’s abandoned wearable, the Basis Ruby Posted yesterday by Brian Heater (@bheater) 0 SHARES Next Story Intel is laying off a major portion of its wearables group Intel’s spent the last few years betting on wearables, but things just aren’t paying off. According to sources close to the company, there are major changes afoot at the chipmaker’s New Devices Group, including some major job loss. From the sound of it, some key projects will likely never see the light of day either, including the Ruby, a new fitness watch developed in-house by Basis, a wearable company swallowed up by Intel in 2014. The Ruby — codenamed “Goblin” according to a source — would have been Basis’s first major new product, assuming you don’t count the Basis Titanium, essentially a dressed-up version of the company’s well-received Peak wearable. The Ruby was set to be a smaller wearable, designed to take on Fitbit’s Charge 2, rather than the Blaze, cramming the Peak’s specs into a more compact form factor, coupled with some overall improvements to connectivity. Originally developed for female users, due to its smaller size, the Ruby was ultimately going to be positioned more broadly. The wearable was also set to arrive with a revamped version of the Basis software. Ultimately, however, the device was canceled, another blow to a company reeling from the Peak’s recalls, and, according to our source, “the beginning of the end.” 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Intel Founded 1968 Overview Intel designs, manufactures, and sells integrated digital technology platforms worldwide.

Jump to Section: Best Price Comments Our Early Verdict The P310 throws the gauntlet at the rest of the competition in the sub-£1,000 desktop workstation PC market. A genuine gem against which others will be measured. For Value for money Mature design Against Cable management could be tidier 250W PSU looks a little lightweight There was a time when workstations were expected to fit a certain template. They were meant to be big, expensive, noisy, and above all, powerful. For years, your average workstation would stick closely to this formula, but things have evolved, driven partly by the industry’s focus on power efficiency. One of these new workstations that dares to be different is the Lenovo ThinkStation P310, a relatively tiny (only 25 litres) model that is surprisingly affordable despite offering some cracking features. The P310 sits below the P410, P510, P710 and the P910, and is Lenovo’s value-offering for the entry-level 3D and 2D CAD/CAM market, offering a serious alternative to high-end desktops thanks to its ISV-certified status. The cheapest model is available for £675 (around $840, AU$1,120) at the time of writing with a three-year onsite, next business day warranty, free delivery, and that’s inclusive of VAT. For that price, you get a quad-core Intel Core i5-6400 CPU with 4GB of RAM and a 500GB hard drive, which is great but certainly not enough for your standard workstation user. There’s plenty to like about the latest entry-level candidate of Lenovo’s Thinkstation family, which is now almost ten years old. Indeed, there are several neat features that can be found across the entire series regardless of the price point. The integrated handles, for example, should be the norm by now. The front one is particularly worth highlighting as it combines an aesthetic touch (the red Lenovo signature) with a practical one (it’s made from rubber to protect the fingers of the user). Not that this machine is particularly heavy or big – at 175 x 426 x 376mm and weighing 13kg, it is just a bit bulkier than two A3 reams of 500 sheets put together. The P310 is also easy to maintain – getting inside the case still requires you to undo two thumb screws to remove the side panel, but that takes a few seconds at most. Once you’re in, adding or removing boards, memory cards or hard disk drives can be done quickly. We’re impressed by the flexible hard drive ‘caddy’ but less enamoured with the so-so cable management. Airflow is excellent thanks to a honeycomb meshed front that’s mostly empty space and allows fresh air to be sucked through efficiently via an 80mm fan at the front. Lenovo engineers came up with an elegant solution to solve the problem associated with customising I/O ports. With ‘Flex Module’ technology, they allow the end-user to easily mix and match the components they need. Around the back, our review sample came with a pair of legacy ports (Serial and D-Sub) as well as two DisplayPorts, four USB 3.0 ports, two USB 2.0, three audio ports and a Gigabit Ethernet connector. At the front are two USB 3.0 ports, a card reader and two audio connectors, together with a power button and a DVD writer. Inside there’s enough room for 64GB of RAM (across four memory slots, supporting ECC), and there are four hard drive bays (one of which is used) with options for RAID-1, 0, 5 and 10, with space even for an internal M.2 SSD. 48GB of Samsung DDR4 2133MHz RAM modules were in our system with a Crucial MX300 1TB SSD and a 512GB Samsung PM951 M2 drive. The processor in our bundled computer was an Intel Core i7-6700, a quad-core, 8-thread monster with 8MB cache and a base clock speed of 3.4GHz. That can be swapped for a Xeon E3-1200 v5 series CPU (E3-1280 v5 is available for a premium). There are four PCIe slots – x16, x4 (x16 mechanical) and two x1 – which can accommodate that M2 via an adaptor as well as an Nvidia Quadro M4000 GPU. By default, the P310 comes with Windows 10 Pro but as always, Microsoft offers a downgrade option to Windows 7 Pro. A slew of Lenovo-only applications (Lenovo Solution Advice, Reachit – which is disabled – Shareit, Thinkvantage tools and PowerEngage) are installed alongside a few usual software suspects. Surprisingly enough, all this is powered by a 250W PSU from FSP. Although it sports a respectable 85% efficiency, we’re concerned that it would prove inadequate should the end-user decide to upgrade an existing system – down the line – with more power-hungry components. We’d advise you to opt for the 92% efficient, 400W model instead to give your components more breathing space. We were pleased to see that Lenovo offers wireless connectivity (802.11ac and Bluetooth 4.0) as an affordable option. Let’s talk for a moment about the keyboard. This rarely deserves a mention, but in this case, the KU-0225 that accompanies Lenovo’s workstation is designed to look like an old-school mechanical keyboard (but it’s still a membrane type). It eschews the current design trends by opting for taller keys with a long but mushy travel and a rather wobbly stand. Still, it’s a welcome change from the identikit keyboards that usually land on our desk. We didn’t expect anything but stellar performance from the parts fitted in the P310 that was sent to us. And indeed it performed fabulously on all the benchmarks thrown at it. The PC’s results were as follows: Passmark: 5,390; GPU: 9,806 CPU-Z: Single-thread: 1,971; Multi-thread: 8,009 GeekBench 4: Single-core: 4,804; Multi-core: 14,045; Compute: 59,156 Cinebench R15: OpenGL: 142.12 fps; GPU: 813 points CrystalDiskMark: Read: 2,533MBps; Write: 1,537MBps Early verdict  The P310 is not perfect – far from it – but its imperfections pale in comparison to the genuinely compelling offer that Lenovo has managed to put together here. The design of this workstation is excellent and when you factor in the cost of the Windows 10 Pro operating system, three-year onsite warranty and free delivery, you wonder how on Earth the Chinese PC vendor is making a profit out of this workstation. The test PC sent to us might have different components thrown in, but the underlying chassis remains the same and is a superb testament to the work achieved by the engineering and design teams from Lenovo. Note that a small form factor model of the P310 is also available but is not on sale at Lenovo’s online shop. You can only buy it from one of the many resellers online.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Surface Studio review round-up 2 by Michael Allison  @Mkeallison Nov 18, 2016 at 21:25 GMT2 days ago Microsoft’s Surface line has been on a roll for the past few years, with new devices like the Surface 3 family, Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book being received to wide critical and commercial acclaim. With the new Surface Studio, Microsoft sets its sights on a new category of devices – the All-in-One PC with a “Surface” twist. The Surface Studio has been reviewed by Digital Trends, CNET (FYI: Autoplays video), Engadget and The Verge. You can click the blue links to see their full review or scroll down to read our four in one takeaway for the cliff notes version. Much like a typical Surface, this one is a looker. The sentence, “This is one gorgeous computer.”  sums up the critical opinion of the Surface Studio. It isn’t simply its minimalistic, understated design, or its aluminum “legs”, or even its beautiful screen that make it so, its the combination of all those factors put together that seemingly elevate the device for these reviewers. When it comes to the display, the praise for the Surface Studio is unanimous. Engadget’s Devindra Hardawar  says “Mostly, I appreciate the Surface Studio simply for having a big freaking screen. After spending years writing on ultraportables and reading news apps on smartphones and tablets, I sometimes forget how nice it is to use a large screen where you can have a pile of windows thrown about, or simply view a full-size webpage next to a document for note taking. It might just be me, but I’ve found that bigger displays simply let me be more creative.” Digital Trends’ Matt Smith says that their “Art Director was in love with the display, saying he found it “incredibly clear, the best Windows display [he’s] seen.” The high pixel density, combined with excellent colour accuracy, makes the Studio eligible for color-critical work right out of the box.” The Verge’s Tom Warren has, even more, words of praise for the Surface’s screen, stating that “It’s stunning to look at and it’s truly one of the best desktop monitors I’ve ever used. It makes things feel oddly lifelike because you can’t see the pixels — text, videos, and pictures just look great on this thing.” One of Microsoft’s strong points with their Surface devices (and for the brief period they made them), their Lumia phones has been the quality of the screen. The firm has excelled at pushing out high quality, well calibrated and beautiful screens, and the Surface Studio is clearly no exception. The internals of the device are powerful and impressive, but their outdated status makes their future-proof status doubtful. “That’s actually some old tech for such a futuristic-looking PC. Microsoft has opted for last year’s Intel and Nvidia chips, and its storage isn’t all solid state.” Tom Warren notes in his review, explaining ” This is especially tough to swallow on the GPU front because Nvidia’s 2016 Pascal architecture is miles ahead of its predecessors. Intel and Nvidia’s latest chips simply weren’t ready in time for the Surface Studio, and the storage uses a mix of 128GB SSD with a 2TB hard disk drive. That’s disappointing because even a GTX 1060 would have pushed the Studio into VR gaming, something Microsoft is starting to support directly in Windows 10.” Digital Trends’ Smith continues that thread “As you can see, the hybrid drive just can’t keep up with solid state drives. The Origin Millennium was ten times quicker in read speeds. Even the Avant, which had a humble (by modern standards) SATA-connected SSD, was several times quicker than the Surface Studio. We can see this being an area of definite concern for certain users, as the drive’s modest performance could put a crimp on certain workloads. Video editing again seems a prime suspect, as 4K editing can task a drive’s write speeds.”, Finally,  Engadget’s Hardawar notes “The only major downside is the Studio’s slow disk speeds, which stem from its hybrid SSD/mechanical hard drive approach to storage.”  Doubts about the future aside, all have positive things to say about its actual performance in the here and now. The Skylake powered Surface, backed with 32GB of RAM helped run apps even as tasking as Photoshop in a “super-responsive” fashion, being able to juggle “dozens of browser tabs, 4K video playback and Minecraft running with high-quality settings all at once without breaking a sweat.” The Surface Dial similarly proved to be both a boon and a bane. Reviewers unanimously panned the peripheral as an “oddity” which was “limited” in scope and application support. Digital Trends’ Smith opines “The Dial is a lot of fun to use, but app support is limited, and that may prove to be the biggest problem. It can’t do much unless developers get on board. It’s also a $100 add-on (pre-orders get it for free), adding even more to the price of this already expensive PC.”, a thread which is picked up by The Verge, “There are nearly 20 apps on Microsoft’s official list, but even many of those just have basic zoom or scroll controls, or just the ability to adjust the system volume. Impressive Dial support can be found in Sketchable, Drawboard, or Mental Canvas, but I’m disappointed that apps like Photoshop don’t have full Dial support. ” All the talk about the Surface Studio is ultimately unimportant if you aren’t the target audience. Microsoft provided a  huge clue by launching it alongside the Windows 10 Creators Update,and demoed it by showing off art focused apps like Sketchable. The Verge and Digital Trends both engaged the services of artists for their reviews to get an artist’s perspective of it. The Verge’s invited freelance artist Lawrence Mann to have a go at using the Surface Studio. He produced two pieces and went on to say “What astounds me is how close Microsoft have got their experience to what I have already carefully crafted with pieces from three different companies,[ Cintiq, MacBook Pro, and Surface Book combination]”. Mann thought the accuracy and pen lag seemed comparable to Wacom’s Cintiq, but to be fully satisfied with the Studio he’d like to see some improvements elsewhere. He would like to have the ability to rotate the display, along with a more ergonomic stylus, and some extra buttons on the Dial for more than the basic controls. Mann says the Studio has left him with a “lot to think about” in terms of opening his own wallet. “I can safely say as a professional digital artist looking to upgrade my main device, the Surface Studio is certainly the strongest contender so far” Meanwhile, Engadget enlisted the software engineer and webcomic creator Alexander Sapountzis as their case study was similarly impressed “On the downside, he noticed that palm rejection was worse than with the iPad Pro, and the software ring around the Dial had the annoying habit of drifting down the screen, even if the Dial was staying in place at the Studio’s lowest angle. Both of those issues ended up disrupting his creative flow, which is exactly the opposite of how Microsoft wants people to see the computer. The Surface Studio also had difficulty recognising when he wanted to move an image around, which often led to unwanted brushstrokes from his fingers. Overall, he was impressed with the Surface Studio’s size and form factor, but he wasn’t looking to switch anytime soon. As for the issues mentioned, hopefully it’s the sort of thing Microsoft could fix with a software update. We’ve asked the company to comment on whether it’s working on any fixes.” You’ll note that despite all the downsides, both artists came to a very impressed conclusion. – and this is a common thread among all the reviews. CNet sees the device as a beautiful design with a “fantastic” screen, “excellent” colours, the Verge concluded that it is “something unique and a hint of real innovation we haven’t seen for some years with PCs”, and Engadget comments that it is a tool which ” empowers us to work the way we always have, while also giving us entirely new modes of productivity.” The Surface Studio still comes with some downsides, the Surface Dial isn’t standard (much like the Surface Keyboard on the Surface Pros), and app support for it is limited out of the door (though one can expect this to change – at least by a small margin), and it is really, really, expensive. To paraphrase the Digital Trends conclusion, if you end up buying this device – no matter who you are – you’ll love it, but unless you’re an artist or creative type in that field, you won’t truly need it.

The Royal Shakespeare Company has teamed up with Intel and The Imaginarium Studios - the CGI wizards behind films like Rise of the Planet of the Apes and Star Wars: The Force Awakens - to recreate Ariel as a shape-shifting digital sprite. While using technology to create illusion and magic in the theatre is nothing new, this is the first time a digital character has been rendered live on stage in real-time, allowing him to transform from sea nymph into flaming harpy in the blink of an eye. Ariel appears on stage above Prospero (Photo: Intel Corporation) Ariel is not a recording but a live performance by an actor, Mark Quartley. His costume contains sensors that pick up his movements and facial expressions – a technique known as "live performance capture". Real-time data from these sensors is mapped onto a complex digital avatar with 336 joints - the equivalent of every joint in the human body - and then projected out through 27 projectors in high-definition, live on stage. While this kind of cutting-edge technology may sound out-of-place in a traditional Shakespearean production, the RSC's artistic director, Gregory Doran, insists it is very fitting. Mark Quartley pictures wearing a performance capture headset (Photo: Intel Corporation) The Tempest was written in the early 1600s, when Jacobean "masques" were all the rage. These multimedia extravaganzas employed the latest stage machinery and lighting techniques to create spectacular stage effects. The Tempest is also regarded as one of Shakespeare's most magical plays, and it even includes a masque scene, suggesting Shakespeare took inspiration from the elaborate court entertainments.

BBC creates amazing experimental device "If Shakespeare were alive today, we believe he would be using the latest technology to bring his characters to life," said Sarah Ellis, head of digital development at the RSC. Ariel in "human" form (Photo: Intel Corporation) Doran makes no attempt to hide the technological aspects of his production from the audience. Even as the digital avatar of Ariel is projected onto the stage, the actor is clearly visible, reinforcing the play's themes of magic and illusion. From a visual perspective, it's breathtaking. Ariel swirls majestically around the stage and looms huge and powerful over his master, Prospero, played by Simon Russell Beale There's something fascinating about seeing Quartley manipulate his digital avatar - in much the same way a puppeteer manipulates a puppet. It gives the performance a feeling of spontaneity that you wouldn't get from a pre-recorded video. Ariel towers over Prospero (Photo: Intel Corporation) However, the technological aspects of the production are not a total success. Despite the vast effort that has gone into faithfully capturing Quartley's performance, some of the details of his movement and expressions are lost in the projection of his image onto gauze curtains in the centre of the stage. Read More Magic mirrors on new MSC Cruises smartships show passengers how clothes will look on them in 3D A lag in the projection also means the avatar often appears out-of-sync with the actor, which breaks the illusion the company is working so hard to create. Ariel is a puppet master to his avatar (Photo: Intel Corporation) It is unfair, of course, to compare live performance capture rendered in real-time on a stage to films and video games that have had months of post-production editing. However, modern audiences are so used to seeing fantastical creatures brought to life in ultra high-definition on the big screen and in video games that it is difficult to overlook the limitations of this production. That is not to take away from the RSC's achievement. Every new technology has a "beta" version, which - although unrefined - contains the kernel of some great innovation. The Tempest View gallery The Imaginarium Studios is already exploring the possibility of using performance capture and projection mapping to create 3D holograms on the stage, rather than just 2D projected images. "Augmented reality within a theatrical space is certainly coming. I think if we were to do this production in five years time it would be a very different thing," said Ben Lumsden, head of studio at The Imaginarium Studios. "Everybody in the auditorium would have a slightly different view – perhaps wearing some glasses and seeing their own version of the show with their own computer graphic that is specifically in tune for that seat in the house." Doran's production of The Tempest may go down in history as the first beta version of live performance capture on stage, but it hints at even more spectacular and exciting things to come. The Tempest is showing at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon until 21 January 2017. It will have a second run at the Barbican Theatre in London from 30 June to 18 August 2017.

Apple in a statement shot down the report and denied throttling, insisting there’s “no discernible difference” in wireless performance between various iPhone 7 models. Research is based on data from more than 100,000 smartphones downloading the same image in large U.S. cities. They ran the same tests on Verizon versions of the Galaxy S7 and the iPhone 7, both of which use Qualcomm’s X12 LTE modem chip. Samsung’s phone was about twice as fast as the iPhone 7 running on the same network. Furthermore, the Verizon iPhone 7 was “a little faster” than its AT&T counterpart, but “not as fast as it could be.” Twin Prime’s Gabriel Tavridis thinks that the Verizon iPhone 7 “is not taking advantage” of all of the carrier’s network capabilities, speculating that Apple “could have chosen to not enable certain features” of the Qualcomm chip. Apple responded with a statement denying throttling Verizon iPhone 7 models: Every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple’s wireless performance standards, quality metrics and reliability testing. In all of our rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards, in thousands of hours of real-world field testing, and in extensive carrier partner testing, the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models. Some of the analysts contacted by Bloomberg suspect Apple may have restrained Verizon edition of the iPhone 7 to ensure a uniform experience across iPhone 7 models. “They don’t want one version to get the reputation that it is better,” said Jackdaw Research’s Jan Dawson. “If Apple had a guiding principle it’s that they want to make sure customers were having a consistent performance.” Unlike prior iPhones, the iPhone 7 uses dual-sourced Qualcomm/Intel modems. Specifically, both “A1778” and “A1784“ models of the iPhone 7 use Intel’s LTE chip which supports AT&T and T-Mobile networks, but not CDMA networks used by Verizon, Sprint and a few other carriers. Qualcomm’s X12 chip, however, is the closest thing to a “worldphone” modem. As a result, AT&T and T-Mobile GSM iPhone 7 models cannot be used on Verizon and Sprint’s CDMA network while the Verizon/Sprint iPhone 7 (model “A1660”) works on any of the four U.S. wireless networks. The Qualcomm chip supports LTE speeds of up to 600Mb/s versus 450Mb/s for the Intel chip. Cellular Insights’ Milan Milanovic speculated that Apple didn’t enable a feature of the Qualcomm chip that uses more channels of data simultaneously than its Intel rival in order “to level the playing field between Qualcomm and Intel.” Another analyst thinks Apple may have de-featured the Qualcomm modem because it would be difficult for them to explain to AT&T why Verizon is offering a superior product. Is Apple really hobbling the Verizon iPhone 7 by not taking full advantage of the Qualcomm chip’s capabilities? And do they have some sort of incentive to balance the performance of iPhones across U.S. wireless carriers? Anything is possible, but the wording of Apple’s statement leaves little room for speculation. Other network testing firms that Bloomberg contacted warn that many factors are at play when it comes to measuring LTE speeds reliably. It should also be noted that poor signal strength in areas of weak reception can significantly affect reported LTE speeds. Then, there are differences in CDMA and GSM radio technologies used by Verizon and AT&T networks, for example. The Verizon iPhone was previously found to perform better in low-signal areas because faster low-signal transfer speeds let it maintain a stronger connection than its AT&T counterpart under similar conditions. Source: Bloomberg Share: Tweet Follow: Follow @iDownloadBlog We Recommend DigiTimes: Intel to supply at least half of iPhone 7’s faster LTE cellular modems Sprint, Verizon and AT&T announce major LTE expansion AT&T’s LTE is the fastest, Verizon rules coverage Sprint’s 4G LTE will be slower than AT&T’s or Verizon’s Related Topics 4G, Apple, AT&T, Carriers, Cellular, iPhone, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, LTE, News, Verizon Zack Morris “As a result, AT&T and T-Mobile iPhone 7 models cannot be used on Verizon or Sprint networks, and vice versa.” This isn’t correct. The Sprint and Verizon Iphone 7 phones (A1660) can work on any of the 4 networks. The ATT and Tmobile version cannot. The sprint and verizon phones are the same model that apple sells unlocked without a sim. Also, Apple’s response doesn’t seem to refute what bloomberg is saying. Apple just says their testing has shown all models are about the same. Bloomberg is saying they are about the same because apple has allegedly throttled the a1660 (verizon and sprint) version to be consistent with att’s model. Due to apple’s cryptic reponse, I am thinking their is some merit to this. Interesting… Christian Zibreg Thanks, updated the post t clarify that AT&T and T-Mobile iPhone 7 cannot be used on Sprint and Verizon networks. iBanks Those phones that experienced slower net probably had safety mode enabled that does throttle the net to 128kbs through Verizon itself. Not device specific. techfreak23 Apple took a step back in networking on the 7 by sourcing 2 completely different modems. I understand why they make decisions like that but it sucks that my AT&T 7 can never be used on Verizon as I am considering switching at some point in the next year. 5723alex . You should have bought the unlocked version or the Verizon version to use with AT&T. Utsav Bhattarai no i unlocked my t-mobile iPhone and while tested; it performed phenomenal with a verizon sim card! won’t trust the news posted here anymore Jimmy1259 What do you think is phenomenal? I read a post earlier from a person that thought their speeds were great. I told him on AT&T in the rural area I’m in I can get almost 3x faster. Doesn’t mean you’re not affected. Utsav Bhattarai https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/03c9be8312d54d0087448cdf94aa569536dc8b96d7ca2ed9e83d8c3ca003cb49.jpg ￼ If you read the part in the article which clearly states” As a result At&t and T-Mobile GSM iPhone 7 models…… Wireless networks”, which clearly contradicts to my usage. When I swapped the sim after unlocking my phone, I was able to use phone calls, internet and messages and every thing with out any hiccups. So being able to use my phone normally is what phenomenal for me. Jimmy1259 Apologies. I thought you meant your download speed was phenomenal. Utsav Bhattarai Its all good. Thank you. I believe that download speeds depends in the area you happen to be in like you mentioned earlier. Jimmy1259 That is true about the area you’re in. Also standing in the same spot at different times of the day can make a difference. My first test showed approx 90 down and around 10 up. Later in the same spot I showed approx 60 down and around 15 up. BasedOnAir what about iPhone 6S a1688? Would that work on Verizon? Jimmy1259 Sorry, but I don’t know. BasedOnAir Do you happen to know if a T-Mobile iPhone 6S a1688 will work on Verizon if it’s unlocked? Utsav Bhattarai I have been using T-Mobile for years, and Everytime I unlocked any model, my spare Verizon sim has always been the best friend to test the unlock. So answering your question, yes it will. BasedOnAir Good to know! Thank you for taking the time to reply.

AI silicon vs AI software Posted on November 18, 2016 by Andreas under Silk Labs There is a lot of activity in the neural network hardware space. Intel just bought Nervana for $400m and Movidius for an undisclosed amount. Both make dedicated silicon to run and train neural networks. Most other chipset vendors I have talked to are similarly interested in adding direct support for neural networks to future chips. I think there is some risk in this approach. Here is why. Most of the time executing a neural network is spent in massive matrix operations such as convolution and matrix multiplication. The state of the art is to use GPUs to do these operations because GPUs have a lot of ALUs and are well optimized for massively data parallel tasks. If you spent time optimizing neural networks for GPUs (we do!), you probably know that a well optimized engine achieves about 40-90% efficiency (ALU utilization). Dedicated neural network silicon aims to raise that to 100%, which is great, but in the end a 2x speedup only. The problematic part is that chipset changes have a long lead time (2-3 years), and you have to commit today to the architectures of tomorrow. And thats where things get tricky. A paper published earlier this year showed that neural networks can be binarized, which reduces the precision of weights to 1 bit (-1, 1). Slow and energy inefficient floating point math turns into very efficient binary math (XNOR), which speeds up the network on existing commodity silicon by 400% with a very small loss in precision. Commodity GPUs support this because they are relatively general purpose computers. Dedicated neural network silicon is much more likely designed for a specific compute mode. In the last 12 months or so alone we have seen dramatic advances in our understanding how to train and evaluate neural networks. Binarization is just one of them, and its fair to expect that over the next 2-3 years similarly impactful advances will be published. Committing to hardware designs based on today’s understanding of neural networks is ill advised in my opinion. My recommendation to chipset vendors is to beef up their GPUs and DSPs, and support a wide range of fixed point and floating point resolutions in a fairly generic manner. Its more likely that that will cover what we’ll want from silicon over the next 2-3 years. Share this: Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit Tumblr Email Like this: Like Loading...

This is vague term covers a very wide variety of laptops that can also serve as tablets. Some have a detachable keyboard, like the Surface Pro 4. Others have a 360-degree display hinge, like the Lenovo Yoga 910. This category has faced an uphill battle. It’s not easy to pack a touchscreen, powerful hardware, and a big battery into one package. We’ve reviewed many 2-in-1s poorly, and those that do are almost universally expensive. Until now. A number of new, high-profile 2-in-1 computers are hitting the market this season. While many of them are still relatively expensive, prices have come down a bit, putting most into the $800 to $1,100 range for a machine with impressive specifications. That’s a leap forward. Past 2-in-1 systems were often both expensive and not particularly quick. More: Has laptop battery life really improved? We tested At the same time, battery life is improving. Older devices often struggled to fit a 40 watt-hour battery, but now we’re seeing systems with 50-watt, 60-watt, and larger units. Stepping up battery size is still the last word in extending battery life, and it has allowed the best 2-in-1s to leap forward from merely adequate endurance, to portability that’s as good as the best conventional laptops. All of that makes it look like this holiday shopping season is a good time to buy a 2-in-1. But have they come far enough to consider buying one instead of a conventional laptop, and are there hidden problems to avoid? We’ll take a closer look in this week’s episode.

The new show known as "Starbright Holidays -- An Intel Collaboration" features 300 illuminated drones choreographed to create images including a Christmas tree, birds and others while holiday music plays in the background. "'Starbright Holidays -- An Intel Collaboration' showcases the latest innovation in storytelling and spellbinding experiences to set your holiday season aglow at Walt Disney World Resort," Disney Parks said. The 5-minute production is the largest drone performance in the United States and is scheduled to take place regularly at the Disney Springs shopping center "later this holiday season," the Orlando Sentinel reported. The Styrofoam Intel Shooting Star drones weigh about as much as a volleyball and are equipped with LED lights capable of creating 4 billion color combinations. "We are excited to work with Walt Disney Imagineering to bring a fresh and innovative approach to its world-renowned light shows," Josh Walden, senior vice president and general manager of Intel's New Technology Group told WPTV. "Together, we worked to tackle the new frontier of entertainment, picturing the sky as our canvas, and flying lights as ink."

SCOUT 2017 DT Josh Rogers (Gabe Brooks / SCOUT) Sooner Intel: Calling on Calvin Thibodeaux Bob Przybylo Friday at 8:55 AM Intel returns with a look at OU's defensive line targets. The Sooner Intel, created by Bob Przybylo in 2011, is an inside look into Oklahoma football and basketball recruiting and is solely for Sooners Illustrated subscribers. It is a sneak peek into what’s happening with OU recruiting and is not to be distributed anywhere else. Not sure this is what Oklahoma defensive line coach Calvin Thibodeaux had in mind when accepting the job with the Sooners, but it has been a whirlwind of a first year. Think everybody knew it would be tough for Thibodeaux to gain traction on the recruiting trail with OU going with its third defensive line coach in as many years. He was going to have to start from scratch and make it happen. What nobody could have predicted was just how insane the year on the field would be. From injuries to suspensions to people leaving the team, Thibodeaux hasn’t had time to worry about recruiting and has had to make sure he can field a defensive line on Saturdays. *Charles Walker (elected to not return to team) *Matt Dimon (removed from roster) *D.J. Ward (minor injuries) *Matt Romar (concussion) *Amani Bledsoe (one-year suspension) *Marquise Overton (fractured foot, medical redshirt) *Du’Vonta Lampkin (six-game suspension) What’s a first-year coach to do? Somehow he has kept it together, while at the same seeing younger players like Lampkin and Neville Gallimore grow and senior Austin Roberts come up big. Somehow Jordan Wade has been the rock to keep it all together and somehow the defensive line remains a pretty strong point to the defense. So kudos on that, Thibodeaux, now hit the recruiting trail. This was a tough week for OU in that regard with Scout 300 prospects Hunter Echols and Greg Rogers basically saying “thanks but no thanks” to being with SoonerSquad17. Echols will stay committed to USC, while Rogers seems destined to stay out west. He hasn’t made his decision public yet, but he’s let the schools know and OU knows to keep searching. And searching Thibodeaux will do. He has one commitment locked up in Tulsa (Okla.) Memorial’s Isaiah Thomas, a Scout 300 prospect. How’s the rest of that class going to be filled out? Some names to watch in the next couple of months. http://www.scout.com/player/196348-josh-rogers?s=73 Houston Christian’s Josh Rogers Rogers has been one of the favorites for a while for the Sooners and everything seems to be trending upward with Rogers and OU. Listed as a defensive tackle, Rogers seems to be the fit OU is hoping for at defensive end. He hasn’t made a trip to Norman yet but plans on doing so in two weeks for Bedlam when Oklahoma State is in town. If OU can impress there, it might be too much for any other school to do in the race. http://www.scout.com/player/184153-joe-anderson?s=73 Wesson (Miss.) Copiah-Lincoln’s Joe Anderson A name that has surfaced recently is Anderson. Committed to Houston since October, he had a bevy of big-time offers before choosing the Cougars. Thibodeaux seems to be reaching out to try to make this happen, and Anderson would be an answer at defensive end. http://www.scout.com/player/162908-lee-autry?s=73 Fulton (Miss.) Itawamba’s Lee Autry Once again, another junior college name that’s only being talked about here recently. Autry is committed to Mississippi State and would clearly one of the defensive tackles Thibodeaux would like to pursue. Hard to gauge his interest or Anderson’s at this point as an offer has not been officially made to either one of them. http://www.scout.com/player/205845-tyreece-lott?s=73 Ardmore (Okla.) Tyreece Lott When in doubt, stay local. Lott is the best of the bunch remaining in OKPreps. At 6-foot-3 and 265 pounds, he seems like someone who could blossom into a defensive tackle prospect. His recruitment is about to take off, following an offer by Kansas. Sooners Illustrated has not had a chance to check out Lott in person. Holy Grail http://www.scout.com/player/162908-lee-autry?s=73 Houston Bellaire Episcopal’s Marvin Wilson He’s still out there. Still. After all these months, the No. 1-ranked defensive tackle has not committed anywhere or even been anywhere close to making a decision. He’s visited Texas A&M, Texas, Florida State (officially), is heading to LSU this weekend but no school seems to be like the odds on favorite. If OU can somehow get him back on campus for Bedlam, it could erase some of the memories from the official visit Ohio State weekend.   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter Trending on Scout A LOT OF UGLY IN LONGHORNS' LOSS TO KANSAS Pregame scuffle breaks out between LSU and UF LIVE Game Chat: OU at West Virginia 60-Hour Test: Who's the Best Army Ranger?

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 18, 2016 at 9:00AM Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is expected to refresh its desktop personal computer processor lineup early next year with offerings based on its Kaby Lake architecture. Image source: Intel.  Although these parts have yet to be formally announced, online retailer Bottom Line Telecommunications recently listed the various Kaby Lake-based desktop processors for pre-order (something first spotted by various tech press outlets). Most of the chips listed are direct replacements for the current generation Skylake processors, but there is at least one model that appears to be a new product -- the dual-core Core i3 7350K. An unlocked Core i3 processor emerges For years now, Intel has offered what it has called K versions of its desktop processors. These chips are based on the same designs as their non-K counterparts, but these chips can be run at higher speeds than what they are rated for by Intel. This practice, known as overclocking, is not relevant to most PC users, but it is quite popular among gamers and other PC enthusiasts. Intel had previously offered K versions of its Core i5 and Core i7 processors but not the Core i3 lineups. The rationale behind such a product Intel K processors tend to command slight premiums relative to their non-K counterparts. That premium is nice for Intel, because it doesn't cost the company any more to manufacture those chips, so margins on these products are a bit higher. Additionally, consumers are willing to pay for it, because they know that they can extract significantly more performance out of the chip via overclocking. Additionally, Intel is specifying the Core i3 7350K to run at 4.2GHz speed out of the box -- modestly faster than the Core i3 7320 (also listed at Bottom Line Telecommunications) and its 4.1GHz rating. Not only is Intel allowing users to run these K processors at higher speeds, the company also appears to be rating them at higher speeds from the get-go. This way, even users who have no intention of overclocking their processors may still want to pay the premium for these offerings due to their faster speeds straight out of the box. This should boost average selling prices I suspect that the reason that Intel held off on putting out unlocked Core i3 processors in the past was the concern that such chips would cannibalize sales of its higher-priced Core i5 processors. Indeed, many games still don't make good use of more than two processor cores, so a super-fast dual-core chip like the Core i3 7350K could be more desirable to gamers than a more expensive quad-core chip. However, I suspect that Intel's marketing department concluded that people (including enthusiasts/gamers) are going to buy Core i3 processors anyway, so why not find a way to sell those same processors for more money, improving gross profit margin? Additionally, since the Core i3 chips plug into the same motherboards as the Core i5 and Core i7 chips, Intel might be betting on buyers of the upcoming Core i3 7350K potentially upgrading to Core i5 or Core i7 processors down the line. My guess is that the net effect of the Core i3 7350K launch will be a slight improvement in Intel's desktop processor average selling prices as a mix-shift up to the 7350K among gamers/PC enthusiasts more than offsets a slight cannibalization of Core i5 processor sales.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Gen. Michael Flynn, national security adviser to President-elect Donald Trump, sat in on intelligence briefings, even as he lobbied for foreign clients. The Flynn Intel Group lobbies for a Dutch company whose Turkish owner runs with that country's resident, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Yahoo News reports, and other unnamed, international businesses. Flynn will be ending his registration as a lobbyist in compliance with a mandate Trump instituted this week barring all incoming administration officials from lobbying for five years after their service to him ends. The ex-military and intelligence official was allowed to lobby on behalf of his clients over the summer while he advised Trump, then the Republican nominee for president, giving rise to ethics complaints. New job: Flynn has been a close adviser to Trump throughout the presidential campaign and has worked with him on national security issues during the transition. He is pictured above at Trump Tower on Thursday Good day? Retired Lt General Michael Flynn (pictured left on Thursday at Trump Tower) has been offered a job as national security adviser to president-elect Donald Trump (right) Executive Director of the Project on Government Oversight Danielle Brian told Yahoo News it is 'deeply disturbing' that Flynn, who was offered the National Security Adviser post in the new administration, continued his work as a lobbyist while he receiving classified information. 'It’s exactly the kind of foreign entanglements our laws are designed to prevent,' she said.   The exact nature of Flynn's firm's work is unknown.  Flynn's lawyer told Yahoo in a statement that the organization is a 'private business intelligence company' with 'international and domestic clients.' It lobbies on behalf of Innova BV, a Holland-based business owned by Ekim Alptekin of Turkey, and other undisclosed companies overseas.

Share this article Share 83 shares Attorney Robert Kelley shared a statement from Flynn that said: 'If I return to government service, my relationship with my company will be severed, in accordance with the policy announced by President-elect Trump.'  Flynn, the Director of the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency from 2012 to 2014, was also paid to travel to Russia within the past year.  He sat at a table with Vladimir Putin at a dinner celebrating the state-run Russia Today television channel. He admitted to Yahoo that he was paid by his speakers bureau to attend the 10th anniversary event but did not disclose the amount. 'If this is true, it’s a disqualifying conflict of interest — if not by ethics laws, certainly in the spirit of conflict of interest, not to mention security regulations,' a retired military officer told Yahoo of Flynn's dual titles of lobbyist and Trump adviser. 'We should be deeply concerned about his ethical judgment, but more specifically how can he possibly provide unbiased advice to the POTUS about Turkey and Russia, when he’s taken money from both.' The retired three star general has been a close adviser to Trump throughout the presidential campaign and has worked with him on national security issues during the transition. They are pictured above in September Flynn was no fly on the wall in the secret-level briefings that Trump was authorized to receive once he became the GOP's nominee for president.  Two briefers, and two other sources who heard about Flynn's behavior second hand, told NBC the former Pentagon official kept interrupting and wouldn't stop until transition head Chris Christie told him to pipe down. Christie, who is now just a vice chair on Trump's team, having been replaced last Friday by Vice President-elect Mike Pence, said the report was a 'complete work of fiction.'  Flynn said it was 'total bulls***'.  Trump is now receiving the same top secret daily briefing as the president but Flynn did not sit in on the first one on Tuesday a source with knowledge of the meeting told Yahoo.  Read more: Michael Flynn, Trump¿s reported pick for national security adviser, sat in on intel briefings ¿ while advising foreign clients What Really Happened at Donald Trump's Intelligence Briefing - NBC News Share or comment on this article e-mail 83 shares Most watched News videos Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Girl won right to be frozen just days before dying Scrapped!

The strange inconsistency was first found on some demo units running in Apple Store showrooms, leading some readers to suggest Apple was running higher-specced machines in-store. However, since then, some owners of newly shipped 15-inch MacBook Pros have also noted the same inconsistency in stock laptops sold to them. MacRumors forum member torquer discovered that on their machine, System Information reports an Intel HD Graphics 530 when the laptop is running on battery, but reports Iris Pro 580 once it's plugged in. This would suggest a bug in macOS Sierra is causing System Information to misreport the integrated graphics chip in some 15-inch MacBook Pro models. Another indication of misreporting is that units which identify the GPU as an Iris Pro 580 appear to show the device ID string "191b", which correlates with the Intel HD Graphics 530 chip. In addition, owners of machines reporting the more powerful Iris Pro 580 are not seeing the kind of graphics performance improvement one would expect. For the record, Intel only matches the more powerful Iris Pro 580 to Core i5-6350HQ and Core i7-6770/6870/6970HQ mobile processors, none of which Apple chose to use in its latest lineup of notebooks, likely due to power consumption concerns.

Wait for the Tim Cook should be fired dude. I would totally agree with you on these points, if it wasn't for all the other things being reported. If it was just one, or two of the recent negative articles, it wouldn't be that big of a deal and most people would probably forget about it in a few weeks. But, with bad news, followed by more bad news, followed by stuff like this, people are going to over react to the individual article because they are looking at everything as a whole. Based off of recent news, I doubt this will be the last non-positive thing we hear about the new MBP. Rating: 30 Votes dannys1 2 days ago at 05:36 am Tiny bug. Not worth a whole article really.

Sigfox is a wireless connectivity player in the IoT world. It sells low-powered networking kit designed for industrial IoT use cases and in its latest announcement said it would be teaming up with Salesforce. The six-year-old firm says it has "more than 10 million objects registered on its network and coverage currently spanning 26 countries" and hopes this Series E funding round will get it to "financial break even point" by 2018. "Thanks to Sigfox, every object will connect to the cloud at minimal cost, by relying only on the surrounding energy sources," the company burbled. Its latest financial backers include Elliott Management, Salesforce, and Intel Capital among others. Back in August, Bloomberg reported that Sigfox was hunting for $200m (€188m), with chief exec Ludovic Le Moan hinting at a 2017 IPO. The company had previously raised $115m in early 2015 from a variety of backers including Telefonica and NTT Docomo. Sigfox's Salesforce integration is with the software company's IoT Cloud, which is intended for customers to process data from wearables, mobile devices, embedded sensors, and the like. Earlier this year it became one of the very few parts of Salesforce's cloudy offerings to be hived off to an outside supplier – in this case, AWS. Xavier Drilhon, the startup's deputy CEO, said in a canned quote: "I joined Sigfox 18 months ago because of the incredibly powerful vision of its founders and the unique positioning of the company as a fundamental enabler of the IoT revolution. This [fundraising round] will allow the company to accelerate the deployment of its network from 26 countries today to over 60 within the next two years, representing 90 per cent of the worldwide GDP." ® Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 2 Comments More from The Register Building IoT: First keynote speaker announced Building IoT OpenSensors.io's Yodit Stanton to take the stage 3 Comments Yeah, that '50bn IoT devices by 2020' claim is a load of dog toffee IDTechX report takes a swipe at other analysts' 'hype bubble' 30 Comments Dell bundles bundle of systems-bundlers into its IoT van Secure or not, it's great if someone's making money Building IoT London: Still working on your pitch?

AFP 2 days ago Justin Tallis © Provided by AFP A digital battle is being waged over the huge amount of technical data that will be stored in autonomous vehicles Just like credit cards, smartphones or search engines, autonomous cars will carry a trove of information about their owners as they make driving more comfortable, raising new concerns about privacy. Automakers are engaged in a fierce race to develop the first driverless car, which experts say should hit the road by 2020. Apart from legal obstacles facing the industry as the technology evolves -- such as who is responsible in the event of an accident -- a digital battle is being waged over the huge amount of technical data that will be stored in such vehicles. "Data is the new oil," Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich said this week during a speech at the Los Angeles auto show, AutoMobility LA. "If you have rich data, your car will be able to deal with complex route situations," Krzanich said. "If not, the car will stop." © Provided by AFP A 2017 Kia Niro Triathlete Inspired autonomous concept car with a shower head in the passenger door is on display at the Los Angeles Auto Show Sensors, radars and cameras on autonomous vehicles will be able to exchange data with other cars but also, perhaps, with "intelligent" roadways that can help set speed limits depending on weather and traffic conditions. The passenger behind the wheel, meanwhile, can send emails and text messages, listen to music, stream movies, hold a conference call or make a restaurant reservation. Even homes will be connected to vehicles. South Korean automaker Hyundai revealed at the auto show a partnership with Amazon's Alexa voice service to allow customers to start their car, charge their battery or turn on the air conditioner via a quick voice request. © Provided by AFP Sensors, radars and cameras on autonomous vehicles will be able to exchange data with other cars but also, perhaps, with "intelligent" roadways Experts say the data stored in these vehicles represents a gold mine for companies. "Where are you, where you stop, how often, what's in there can be used to provide you a rich user experience," Krzanich said. "What music you like, craft choices... that's an opportunity as well." He said Intel was investing $250 million into self-driving technology over the next two years. Karl Brauer, senior director of industry insights at Kelley Blue Book, said all the data collected will be used by car makers and other companies to maximize profit. "If they know you like to go to Starbucks (they will say) 'Oh, he always stops at Starbucks," Brauer said. Krzanich acknowledged that the technology posed great challenges in terms of privacy protection and secure sharing. CJ Frost, an Alexa executive, told a panel that consumers were heading into a world where applications will allow users, for example, to track down friends coming to dinner to ask them to stop on the way and buy a bottle of wine. Security concerns © Provided by AFP Hyundai revealed a partnership with Amazon's Alexa voice service to allow customers to start cars, charge their battery or turn on the air conditioner via a voice request One question on many people's mind is whether, in a world that could be edging closer to the Big Brother oversight of George Orwell's dystopian novel "1984," it will be possible to disconnect at some point. "Consumer privacy is an open question," said Jeremy Carlston, a senior analyst with IHS Automotive. "A smartphone holds a lot of info about the owner but when we provide that info to a service provider, we're getting value in return," he added. "It's the same trade-off with an autonomous car." Cyber-security was also the topic at a panel discussion during which speakers raised the issue of privacy. "Connected cars have added firewalls against hacking," Egil Juliussen, director of research at IHS Automotive, told AFP. "Criminals could make the car inoperative and ask money to make it operate again." In mid-2015, two American online-security researchers demonstrated how easily they could hack into a Jeep Cherokee, remotely taking control of the car's functions, including its braking system. Krzanich said such challenges "will require the industry coming together and collaborating."

A Magnetized Needle and a Steady Hand November 17, 2016 nullprogram.com/blog/2016/11/17/ Now they’ve gone an done it. An unidentified agency has spread a potent computer virus across all the world’s computers and deleted the binaries for every copy of every software development tool. Even the offline copies — it’s that potent. Most of the source code still exists, even for the compilers, and most computer systems will continue operating without disruption, but no new software can be developed unless it’s written byte by byte in raw machine code. Only real programmers can get anything done. The world’s top software developers have been put to work bootstrapping a C compiler (and others) completely from scratch so that we can get back to normal. Without even an assembler, it’s a slow, tedious process. In the mean time, rather than wait around for the bootstrap work to complete, the rest of us have been assigned individual programs hit by the virus. For example, many basic unix utilities have been wiped out, and the bootstrap would benefit from having them. Having different groups tackle each missing program will allow the bootstrap effort to move forward somewhat in parallel. At least that’s what the compiler nerds told us. The real reason is that they’re tired of being asked if they’re done yet, and these tasks will keep the rest of us quietly busy. Fortunately you and I have been assigned the easiest task of all: We’re to write the true command from scratch. We’ll have to figure it out byte by byte. The target is x86-64 Linux, which means we’ll need the following documentation: Executable and Linking Format (ELF) Specification. This is the binary format used by modern Unix-like systems, including Linux. A more convenient way to access this document is man 5 elf. Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual (Volume 2). This fully documents the instruction set and its encoding. It’s all the information needed to write x86 machine code by hand. The AMD manuals would work too. System V Application Binary Interface: AMD64 Architecture Processor Supplement. Only a few pieces of information are needed from this document, but more would be needed for a more substantial program. Some magic numbers from header files. Manual Assembly The program we’re writing is true, whose behavior is documented as “do nothing, successfully.” All command line arguments are ignored and no input as read. The program only needs to perform the exit system call, immediately terminating the process. According to the ABI document (3) Appendix A, the registers for system call arguments are: rdi, rsi, rdx, r10, r8, r9. The system call number goes in rax. The exit system call takes only one argument, and that argument will be 0 (success), so rdi should be set to zero. It’s likely that it’s already zero when the program starts, but the ABI document says its contents are undefined (§3.4), so we’ll set it explicitly. For Linux on x86-64, the system call number for exit is 60, (/usr/include/asm/unistd_64.h), so rax will be set to 60, followed by syscall.     xor  edi, edi
    mov  eax, 60
    syscall
 There’s no assembler available to turn this into machine code, so it has to be assembled by hand. For that we need the Intel manual (2). The first instruction is xor, so look up that mnemonic in the manual. Like most x86 mnemonics, there are many different opcodes and many ways to encode the same operation. In this case, there are 22 options. The operands are two 32-bit registers, so there are two options available (opcodes 0x31 and 0x33): 31 /r      XOR r/m32, r32
33 /r      XOR r32, r/m32
 The “r/m32” means the operand can be either a register or the address of a 32-bit region of memory. With two register operands, both encodings are equally valid, both have the same length (2 bytes), and neither is canonical, so the decision is entirely arbitrary. Let’s pick the first one, opcode 0x31, since its listed first. The “/r” after the opcode means the register-only operand (“r32” in both cases) will be specified in the ModR/M byte. This is the byte that immediately follows the opcode and specifies one of two of the operands. The ModR/M byte is broken into three parts: mod (2 bits), reg (3 bits), r/m (3 bits). This gets a little complicated, but if you stare at Table 2-1 in the Intel manual for long enough it eventually makes sense. In short, two high bits (11) for mod indicates we’re working with a register rather than a load. Here’s where we’re at for ModR/M: 11 ??? ???
 The order of the x86 registers is unintuitive: ax, cx, dx, bx, sp, bp, si, di. With 0-indexing, that gives di a value of 7 (111 in binary). With edi as both operands, this makes ModR/M: 11 111 111
 Or, in hexadecimal, FF. And that’s it for this instruction. With the opcode (0x31) and the ModR/M byte (0xFF): 31 FF
 The encoding for mov is a bit different. Look it up and match the operands. Like before, there are two possible options: B8+rd id   MOV r32, imm32
C7 /0 id   MOV r/m32, imm32
 In the B8+rd notation means the 32-bit register operand (rd for “register double word”) is added to the opcode instead of having a ModR/M byte. It’s followed by a 32-bit immediate value (id for “integer double word”). That’s a total of 5 bytes. The “/0” in second means 0 goes in the “reg” field of ModR/M, and the whole instruction is followed by the 32-bit immediate (id). That’s a total of 6 bytes. Since this is longer, we’ll use the first encoding. So, that’s opcode 0xB8 + 0, since eax is register number 0, followed by 60 (0x3C) as a little endian, 4-byte value. Here’s the encoding for the second instruction: B8 3C 00 00 00
 The final instruction is a cakewalk. There are no operands, it comes in only one form of two operands. 0F 05   SYSCALL
 So the encoding for this instruction is: 0F 05
 Putting it all together the program is 9 bytes: 31 FF B8 3C 00 00 00 0F 05
 Aren’t you glad you don’t normally have to assemble entire programs by hand? Constructing the ELF Back in the old days you may have been able to simply drop these bytes into a file and execute it. That’s how DOS COM programs worked. But this definitely won’t work if you tried it on Linux. Binaries must be in the Executable and Linking Format (ELF). This format tells the loader how to initialize the program in memory and how to start it. Fortunately for this program we’ll only need to fill out two structures: the ELF header and one program header. The binary will be the ELF header, followed immediately by the program header, followed immediately by the program. To fill this binary out, we’d use whatever method the virus left behind for writing raw bytes to a file. For now I’ll assume the echo command is still available, and we’ll use hexadecimal \xNN escapes to write raw bytes. If this isn’t available, you might need to use the magnetic needle and steady hand method, or the butterflies. The very first structure in an ELF file must be the ELF header, from the ELF specification (1):     typedef struct {
        unsigned char e_ident[EI_NIDENT];
        uint16_t      e_type;
        uint16_t      e_machine;
        uint32_t      e_version;
        ElfN_Addr     e_entry;
        ElfN_Off      e_phoff;
        ElfN_Off      e_shoff;
        uint32_t      e_flags;
        uint16_t      e_ehsize;
        uint16_t      e_phentsize;
        uint16_t      e_phnum;
        uint16_t      e_shentsize;
        uint16_t      e_shnum;
        uint16_t      e_shstrndx;
    } ElfN_Ehdr;
 No other data is at a fixed location because this header specifies where it can be found. If you’re writing a C program in the future, once compilers have been bootstrapped back into existence, you can access this structure in elf.h. The ELF header The EI_NIDENT macro is 16, so e_ident is 16 bytes. The first 4 bytes are fixed: 0x7F, E, L, F. The 5th byte is called EI_CLASS: a 32-bit program (ELFCLASS32 = 1) or a 64-bit program (ELFCLASS64 = 2). This will be a 64-bit program (2). The 6th byte indicates the integer format (EI_DATA). The one we want for x86-64 is ELFDATA2LSB (1), two’s complement, little-endian. The 7th byte is the ELF version (EI_VERSION), always 1 as of this writing. The 8th byte is the ABI (ELF_OSABI), which in this case is ELFOSABI_SYSV (0). The 9th byte is the version (EI_ABIVERSION), which is just 0 again. The rest is zero padding. So writing the ELF header: echo -ne '\x7FELF\x02\x01\x01\x00' > true
echo -ne '\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00' >> true
 The next field is the e_type. This is an executable program, so it’s ET_EXEC (2). Other options are object files (ET_REL = 1), shared libraries (ET_DYN = 3), and core files (ET_CORE = 4). echo -ne '\x02\x00' >> true
 The value for e_machine is EM_X86_64 (0x3E). This value isn’t in the ELF specification but rather the ABI document (§4.1.1). On BSD this is instead named EM_AMD64. echo -ne '\x3E\x00' >> true
 For e_version it’s always 1, like in the header. echo -ne '\x01\x00\x00\x00' >> true
 The e_entry field will be 8 bytes because this is a 64-bit ELF. This is the virtual address of the program’s entry point. It’s where the loader will pass control and so it’s where we’ll load the program. The typical entry address is somewhere around 0x400000. For a reason I’ll explain shortly, our entry point will be 120 bytes (0x78) after that nice round number, at 0x40000078. echo -ne '\x78\x00\x00\x40\x00\x00\x00\x00' >> true
 The e_phoff field holds the offset of the program header table. The ELF header is 64 bytes (0x40) and this structure will immediately follow. It’s also 8 bytes. echo -ne '\x40\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00' >> true
 The e_shoff header holds the offset of the section table. In an executable program we don’t need sections, so this is zero. echo -ne '\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00' >> true
 The e_flags field has processor-specific flags, which in our case is just 0. echo -ne '\x00\x00\x00\x00' >> true
 The e_ehsize holds the size of the ELF header, which, as I said, is 64 bytes (0x40). echo -ne '\x40\x00' >> true
 The e_phentsize is the size of one program header, which is 56 bytes (0x38). echo -ne '\x38\x00' >> true
 The e_phnum field indicates how many program headers there are. We only need the one: the segment with the 9 program bytes, to be loaded into memory. echo -ne '\x01\x00' >> true
 The e_shentsize is the size of a section header. We’re not using this, but we’ll do our due diligence. These are 64 bytes (0x40). echo -ne '\x40\x00' >> true
 The e_shnum field is the number of sections (0). echo -ne '\x00\x00' >> true
 The e_shstrndx is the index of the section with the string table. It doesn’t exist, so it’s 0. echo -ne '\x00\x00' >> true
 The program header Next is our program header.     typedef struct {
        uint32_t   p_type;
        uint32_t   p_flags;
        Elf64_Off  p_offset;
        Elf64_Addr p_vaddr;
        Elf64_Addr p_paddr;
        uint64_t   p_filesz;
        uint64_t   p_memsz;
        uint64_t   p_align;
    } Elf64_Phdr;
 The p_type field indicates the segment type. This segment will hold the program and will be loaded into memory, so we want PT_LOAD (1). Other kinds of segments set up dynamic loading and such. echo -ne '\x01\x00\x00\x00' >> true
 The p_flags field gives the memory protections. We want executable (PF_X = 1) and readable (PF_R = 4). These are ORed together to make 5. echo -ne '\x05\x00\x00\x00' >> true
 The p_offset is the file offset for the content of this segment. This will be the program we assembled. It will immediately follow the this header. The ELF header was 64 bytes, plus a 56 byte program header, which is 120 (0x78). echo -ne '\x78\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00' >> true
 The p_vaddr is the virtual address where this segment will be loaded. This is the entry point from before. A restriction is that this value must be congruent with p_offset modulo the page size. That’s why the entry point was offset by 120 bytes. echo -ne '\x78\x00\x00\x40\x00\x00\x00\x00' >> true
 The p_paddr is unused for this platform. echo -ne '\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00' >> true
 The p_filesz is the size of the segment in the file: 9 bytes. echo -ne '\x09\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00' >> true
 The p_memsz is the size of the segment in memory, also 9 bytes. It might sound redundant, but these are allowed to differ, in which case it’s either truncated or padded with zeroes. echo -ne '\x09\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00' >> true
 The p_align indicates the segment’s alignment. We don’t care about alignment. echo -ne '\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00' >> true
 Append the program Finally, append the program we assembled at the beginning. echo -ne '\x31\xFF\xB8\x3C\x00\x00\x00\x0F\x05' >> true
 Set it executable (hopefully chmod survived!): chmod +x true
 And test it: ./true && echo 'Success'

About the startups Flutterwave is a San Francisco-based team of African entrepreneurs, financial services technologists & mobile payment experts that provides end-to-end payments technology and infrastructure which enables payment service providers, global merchants, licensed money transfer operators and pan-African banks to process payments to and from Africa with one API integration. They are a graduate of the Y-Combinator Accelerator in Silicon Valley, whose graduates have included companies such as Airbnb, Dropbox, Stripe, Eventbrite, and Instacart, amongst several others. E-Factor is a South African-based fintech company that has created a digital factoring platform where companies can sell their receivable invoices through an auction to investors with the highest bid. By investing in these invoices, investors obtain new short-term investment instruments with low-risk returns. E-Factor (formerly called InvoiceXchange) is a graduate of the Barclays Tech Lab Africa Accelerator. Advertisement IWI Africa, also a graduate of the Tech Lab Africa Accelerator Programme, is a Uganda-based Fintech company that aggregates payments and commerce into a single platform that enables businesses to transact with their customers on any mobile device. IWI Africa gives businesses platform solutions enabling them to automate their payments and commerce and ultimately increase revenue and/or reduce their costs and general business efficiencies. Creating an enabling environment “As Cactus Advisors, simply investing into high growth, high impact tech-enabled ventures on the continent is not good enough, unless we critically have the right enabling environment on the continent for tech startups to access markets, channel partners and customers," said George. "Corporate Africa with its powerful consortium of financial services firms, retailers, telecommunication firms, insurance companies and media houses – all of whom are yet to seriously tap into the innovation pipeline that tech startups offer – provides the ideal platform for commercialising proof-of-concept agreements with startups that serves as a perfect risk mitigation shield to investors looking for returns in the African venture capital sector.” George spent three years running the Africa operations of U-Start, a global investment advisory firm for venture capital and private family offices, before he founded Cactus Advisors to pioneer corporate venture capital driven accelerator programmes on the African continent in partnership with Philip Kiracofe, an American venture capitalist and partner at Horizen Ventures Africa. Following on the successes of the Barclays Tech Lab Africa Accelerator where 10 fintech and health-tech ventures raised a collective total of $10million along with seven engagements and Proof of Concept projects with Barclays - the pair were offered to jointly run Startupbootcamp in Africa. Startupbootcamp is a global network of industry focused startup accelerators that scales and grows startups globally by giving them direct access to an international network of the most relevant partners, content, investors and mentors in their sector. ‹    Like Save Email Print PDF Advertisement Comment on thisComment Comment guidelines and disclaimer LEGAL DISCLAIMER: This Message Board accepts no liability of legal consequences that arise from the Message Boards (e.g. defamation, slander, or other such crimes).

While the MacBook Pro was dramatically overhauled this year with a new design, faster internals, an all-new Touch Bar, and more, the desktop offerings, specifically the Mac mini and Mac Pro, were left untouched. In fact, while the iMacs were last updated a little over a year ago, it has been since 2014 when the Mac mini saw even a speed bump and you have to go back over 1000 days to 2013 when the Mac Pro was updated with Apple VP of Marketing Phil Schiller rather ironically saying “can’t innovate anymore my ass.” Apple’s inattention in this area has left many to question whether or not either standalone Mac has a future or if Apple could push the less lucrative desktop business into the hands of another company. Doing so could keep Apple’s customers happy and offer significant time and monetary incentives for Apple… Apple dramatically overhauled the Mac Pro back in 2013 with an all-new cylindrical design. The design is significantly smaller than the previous tower-esque Mac Pro, giving it a much smaller footprint. Apple also, of course, notably improved the speed capabilities of the Mac Pro with the 2013 refresh. But the updated design made it more difficult for users to perform their own upgrades after purchasing the machine. As CPUs and GPUs have gotten faster since 2013, Mac Pro users have been left behind. Almost a year ago, Oculus founder Palmer Luckey said: It boils down to the fact that Apple doesn’t prioritize high-end GPUs. You can a buy $6,000 Mac Pro with the top of the line AMD FirePro D700 and it still doesn’t meet our recommended spec. If they prioritize higher-end GPUs like they used to for awhile back in the day, I think we’d love to support Mac. Since 2013, the Mac Pro has not been touched by Apple. There haven’t been any spec bumps, design tweaks, or port changes since then. In fact, the Mac Pro still features four outdated USB-A ports and 6 Thunderbolt 2 ports, technologies that Apple is quickly moving away from on their laptops, as evident by the new MacBook and MacBook Pro. It’s much of the same with the Mac mini. That machine was first released in 2005, and eventually morphed into the small aluminum square that we have today. The point is that for years Apple kept the Mac mini up to date, with yearly design refreshes, and/or spec upgrades. In fact, both machines had been updated almost every year prior to Tim Cook taking over Apple in 2011. After Cook’s takeover, Mac mini/Pro updates all but stopped. It’s impossible to know if these things are related but it is certainly notable. The Mac mini was last updated in 2014 with an under-the-hood spec bump to bring it up to date with Intel’s Haswell processors. The last dramatic design update to the Mac mini came in 2010 with the switch to a unibody aluminum design, meaning the Mac mini has been largely the same in terms of design for 6 years now. With the Mac Pro and Mac mini both lagging significantly behind in terms of upgrades, I’m really starting to question Apple’s commitment to the Mac desktop market. Apple didn’t mention either device at its Mac-focused event last month, and that’s just the continuation of a trend that has been ongoing for years now. Apple’s inattention to the Mac Pro and Mac mini comes at a time when PC manufacturers are pushing forward with machines similar to the ones Apple pioneered. For instance, just yesterday HP introduced its new Z2 Mini (Above), which if you’ve ever seen a Mac mini and imagine it morphed with a Mac Pro, should look very familiar. The Z2 Mini comes starts at $699 and significantly out-powers the most recent Mac mini by a long shot. In fact, with the latest Xeon processors and NVIDIA Quadro Pro Graphics, I’m pretty sure it could give the 3-year-old Mac Pro a run for its money. Further proving its lack of interest in desktop machines is Apple’s move to seemingly outsource its display business to LG. Alongside the new MacBook Pros, Apple announced that it had worked with LG on new UltraFine 4K and 5K standalone monitors, just months after the (very outdated) Thunderbolt Display was discontinued and it remarked that it was out of the display business. How is Apple going to market standalone Mac models without offering a first-party display to go along with them? While LG’s displays appear to be very good, Apple/Mac purists aren’t in love with the black plastic matte bezels, and quite frankly, the lack of an Apple logo. Furthermore, Apple’s own marketing seems to suggest that it designed the new MacBook Pro as a machine that can be used both on-the-go and at a desk. During the unveil event, Apple showed the above image while touting the capabilities of Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C. The image shows a MacBook Pro powering an entire desk setup, including two monitors and a variety of other equipment. Apple’s logic here seems to be, “Why should a person have two different machines for desk and on-the-go work when one can do both?” It’s clear that Apple’s interest in the desktop market is waning. And given the company’s focus on lucrative, mass markets, it makes sense that the Mac mini and Mac Pro wouldn’t be a top priority. There are, however, ways that Apple can continue to please desktop users while also focusing on other products. One possibility here would be for Apple to set macOS free and license it to be installed on the hardware from other companies.  Apple could work closely with the companies to ensure that everything is up to par, but this still seems like a long shot.  Apple of course ran a clone program as its fortunes waned in the 90s at the hands of Microsoft. After fighting off fakes for years, the company launched an official clone program for Mac OS that saw it license the operating system to other manufacturers in order to help it penetrate the market at a faster rate. Mostly, clones just cannibalized Apple sales and undercut its pricing. One of the 1st things Steve Jobs did when he came back to Apple was kill off the clone licensing program. But Apple doesn’t seem care about its waning desktop Mac numbers (or so it would seem). If Apple could create a lock in system on its own terms, it could stand to make a lot of money with very little effort (even less than it is exerting now). When you think about it, there’s very little Apple-exclusive hardware in a Mac. Apple’s newest Macs feature the Apple T1 chip for Touch ID and Touch Bar, but everything else is pretty much off the shelf PC product purchased from other companies: RAM/SSDs from Samsung, GPUs from Nvidia/AMD and of course processors from Intel. As for the Touch Bar, Apple could sell a standalone Magic Keyboard with Touch Bar, as we’ve suggested in the past. This would allow for Apple to still have control Touch ID and the secure enclave which gives access to the Mac identity whether it is stored in the cloud or on an encrypted local SSD. So picture this: a pair of desktop-oriented Macs, manufactured by a third-party, with licensed macOS running on them and a standalone Magic Keyboard with Touch Bar sold by Apple. This would allow for Apple to focus its attention on its other products and continuing to innovate in new categories, as well. Even if this doesn’t come to fruition– and let’s be honest, it’s a long shot – it’s becoming more and more apparent that Apple is shifting its focus from the desktop to the laptop, iPad, iPhone, and Apple Watch. With the company’s product lineup becoming more personal (whether or not that’s a good thing is an entirely different argument), less commercially popular devices like the Mac mini and Mac Pro are seemingly being ignored. And Apple seems to have no regrets about that. It’s been 1,064 days since the Mac Pro was upgraded and 763 days since the Mac mini was upgraded…and counting and no other products are expected until 2017. As a comparison, Apple last updated the iPod Classic in 2009 and discontinued it 5 years later in 2014 after it couldn’t get any more parts. What do you think about Apple’s commitment to the desktop market?

Gen. Michael Flynn talks to media as he arrives at Trump Tower, Nov. 17, 2016, in New York. (Photo: Carolyn Kaster/AP)More Retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who has reportedly been offered the role of national security adviser in Donald Trump’s White House, began receiving classified national security briefings last summer while he was also running a private consulting firm that offered “all-source intelligence support” to international clients. Flynn’s relationship with his overseas clients is coming in for new scrutiny amid recent disclosures that two months ago, during the height of the presidential campaign, his consulting firm, the Flynn Intel Group, registered to lobby for a Dutch company owned by a wealthy Turkish businessman close to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. Robert Kelley, the chief counsel to the Flynn Intel Group, read a statement from Flynn to Yahoo News on Thursday, promising that “if I return to government service, my relationship with my company will be severed, in accordance with the policy announced by President-elect Trump.” But critics today dismissed Flynn’s pledge as “Too little, too late,” given that he began sitting in on U.S. intelligence briefings for Trump in August while working for foreign clients. Classified national security briefings are by tradition provided to the major presidential candidates and their top aides. “This is profoundly troubling and should be disqualifying,” said Norm Eisen, who served as President Obama’s ethics adviser and later as an ambassador to the Czech Republic. He predicted that if Flynn is named as Trump’s national security adviser, “there will be wholesale resignations of national security professionals, and I believe some have already drafted their resignation letters.” On Wednesday, the White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, said that President Obama had authorized that the President’s Daily Brief (PDB) materials also be provided to Trump, Vice President-elect Mike Pence and “designated” members of Trump’s transition team. The PDB comprises some of the most sensitive intelligence in the U.S. government, beyond the national security briefings Trump received as the Republican nominee. But White House officials declined to say Thursday whether Flynn — an “executive” member of the Trump transition team and his chief foreign policy adviser during the campaign — was among those so designated. Flynn was not in attendance on Tuesday when Trump received his first PDB briefing at Trump Tower, according to a source familiar with the matter. Trump transition officials did not respond to requests for comment. View photos Donald Trump, left, jokes with retired Gen. Michael Flynn at a rally at Grand Junction Regional Airport on Oct. 18, 2016, in Grand Junction, Colo. (Photo: George Frey/Getty Images)More The criticism of Flynn over his overseas clients came on a day that the Trump transition team announced a sweeping new conflict-of-interest policy that will require all members of the transition team to sever their relationships with lobbying clients and, if they join the administration, forswear lobbying for five years after ending their government service. It does not apply to past lobbying contracts. A transition official said that “instead of looking backward,” the new policy “looks forward.” But according to a copy of a Memorandum of Understanding signed on Election Day, and released today by House Democrats, the Trump transition team, as a condition of receiving government briefing materials, was required to provide a statement to White House chief of staff Denis McDonough last week that all designated members of the transition team had disclosed their financial interests and did not have any conflicts of interest. A Trump transition spokesman did not respond to questions about whether Flynn had made such disclosures.  But Rep. Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said the terms of the memorandum raise questions about whether Flynn is even eligible to continue to receive national security briefings at this point. The full extent of Flynn’s overseas business is unclear. In the statement released by his lawyer, Flynn said only that his firm — which he described as a “private business intelligence company” — has unnamed “international and domestic clients.” In a brief telephone interview, Kelley, a former Capitol Hill staffer, declined to specify the issues for which the firm was hired to lobby Congress on behalf of Innova BV, a firm based in Holland and owned by the Turkish businessman, Ekim Alptekin. The lobbying disclosure statement filed with the secretary of the Senate on Sept. 30 states only that Flynn’s firm “will advise client on U.S. domestic and foreign policy” and congressional appropriations bills for the State Department. Alptekin, according to his LinkedIn profile, serves as chairman of the Turkish American Business Council, is the founder and president of EA Havacilik, an aerospace firm based in Istanbul, and is “commercially active in the real estate and defense industries” through multiple other companies. He also serves as a member of Turkey’s Foreign Economic Relations Board and, in that role, helped coordinate Erdogan’s visit to the United States earlier this year, according to the Daily Caller, which first reported Flynn’s lobbying contract.

(Photo: Mikhail Klimentyev/Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP)More Without disclosing his lobbying relationship with the Turkish-owned firm, Flynn published an op-ed in the newspaper the Hill on Election Day, in which he advanced the No. 1 cause of Erdogan’s government: advocating the extradition of Fethullah Gülen, a Turkish exile living in Pennsylvania whom Erdogan has blamed for instigating the failed military coup against his government last summer. In the op-ed, which ran under the headline “Our ally Turkey is in crisis and needs our support,” Flynn described Gülen as a “shady Islamic mullah,” who runs a “vast global network [that] has all the right markings to fit the description of a dangerous sleeper network. From Turkey’s point of view, Washington is harboring Turkey’s Osama bin Laden.” This is the not the first time questions have been raised about Flynn’s overseas ties. Last December, Flynn, who served as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency from 2012 until 2014, flew to Moscow to participate in the 10th anniversary of RT, the Russian government propaganda network. He gave an interview to one of its anchors and attended a gala dinner where he sat at the same table as Russian President Vladimir Putin. In a testy exchange with Yahoo News during the Republican Convention in Cleveland in July, Flynn acknowledged that he was paid through his speakers bureau to attend the RT event, but he declined to say how much. What was striking, according to ethics experts, is that given his overseas consulting business, Flynn began sitting in on classified intelligence briefings with Trump last summer. Flynn was reportedly so assertive during the initial briefing in August, peppering the briefers with rapid-fire questions, that Trump’s adviser Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who also attended the briefing, was prompted to try to calm him down by placing a hand on his arm.  Danielle Brian, executive director of the Project on Government Oversight, an outside watchdog group, said that she finds it “deeply disturbing” that Flynn attended these briefings at a time that he was representing foreign clients with interests before the U.S. government. “It’s exactly the kind of foreign entanglements our laws are designed to prevent,” she said. One retired military officer who has advised both Republican and Democratic presidents said of the allegations about Flynn: “If this is true, it’s a disqualifying conflict of interest — if not by ethics laws, certainly in the spirit of conflict of interest, not to mention security regulations. We should be deeply concerned about his ethical judgment, but more specifically how can he possibly provide unbiased advice to the POTUS about Turkey and Russia, when he’s taken money from both.”   Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next Mike Pence tries to end the 'Hamilton' drama while Trump stokes the flames Mashable Suddenly, Trump Has Three Middle East Crises on His Hands The Fiscal Times Clinton's Popular Vote Lead Over Trump Now Exceeds 1.5 Million Votes ABC News Ivanka isn’t the only reason these photos of Trump meeting Abe are problematic Quartz Performance of Chicago 'Hamilton' disrupted Chicago Tribune Gold Star family of slain California soldier booed on flight Associated Press Donald Trump's Cabinet Begins to Take Shape ABC News Videos Merkel tells party ready to seek fourth term as chancellor AFP Warplanes pound Aleppo – Dozens dead Yahoo News Photo Staff 8 Arrested in White Lives Matter Protest Clash Near Texas Capitol ABC News Donald Trump Taps Sen.

Google and Intel will explore new ways of using their respective technologies to deliver high-end cloud services for enterprises. The two technology giants this week announced a strategic alliance that will focus on technology integrations and joint marketing efforts. The partnership builds on an existing relationship between the two companies under which Google has been working with Intel to develop data center processor technologies, Google's head of technology partners Nan Boden announced on the company's Keyword blog. The objective of the new alliance is to find the best way to combine Google's Cloud software capabilities with Intel's advanced hardware in areas like cloud cluster management, machine learning, security and the Internet of Things (IoT). For instance, one core focus area is Kubernetes, Google's container cluster management technology. Intel already plays a big role in the Kubernetes ecosystem, by among other things, enabling organizations to run OpenStack as a Kubernetes workload, Boden said. Engineers from both companies have also delivered code optimizations that enable Kubernetes workloads to run more efficiently on Intel hardware. Under the new alliance Google and Intel will work on further optimizing Intel hardware so it can run a broader range of Kubernetes workloads. Similarly, under the new partnership Google and Intel will work on accelerating the performance of Google’s TensorFlow open source machine learning software library on Intel CPUs. As part of the effort, the two companies will explore how to tweak TensorFlow so it leverages Intel CPU cores more efficiently and takes better advantage of the advanced memory allocation capabilities on the hardware. The alliance also calls for the companies to create what Boden described as a secure platform for connecting Intel's IoT devices to Google Cloud Platform. The goal is to enable better collection and analysis of data from the IoT devices, especially those deployed in industries like manufacturing and retail. The goals on the security front are somewhat less clear. According to Boden, Google and Intel will work on "enhancing security integrations between Intel hardware and [Google Cloud Platform] infrastructure that will further improve security for enterprise customers." She did not elaborate on what exactly is being enhanced and how. The new partnership is part of an ongoing effort by Google to broaden its cloud footprint and its portfolio of offerings for enterprise customers. Only earlier this week the company announced a somewhat similar partnership with Advanced Micro Devices. That alliance calls on Google to deploy AMD's fastest and most powerful server processor in its datacenter. Google has said it plans to use the processors to accelerate performance of its Google Compute Engine and Google Machine Learning services. Google has said it will make the AMD CPU resources, which power applications ranging from complex medical and financial simulations to scientific analysis, available to cloud computing users around the world.           LATEST CLOUD ARTICLES   New Tool Shines Light on $5 Billion Web Traffic Fraud Racket Microsoft's Azure Advisor Helps Customers Float Cloud Applications Early Stage Startup Heptio Aims to Make Kubernetes Friendly Google, Intel to Collaborate on Cloud, IoT Technolgies Social Media Sites Take Risks When Blocking Speech They Don't Like                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

NOVEMBER 20 ― Britain’s vote to withdraw from the European Union followed by Donald Trump’s election in the US constitute a single giant political event — one that makes 2016 a vintage year in history that will long be studied. Big political events have big causes. For the last three years I’ve been working on a book about what’s been happening beneath the surface — in the plumbing and wiring of the world — that’s roiling politics in so many places. My answer begins with a question: What the hell happened in and around 2007? 2007? That’s such an innocuous year. But look again. Steve Jobs and Apple released the first iPhone in 2007, starting the smartphone revolution that is now putting an internet-connected computer in the palm of everyone on the planet. In late 2006, Facebook, which had been confined to universities and high schools, opened itself to anyone with an email address and exploded globally. Twitter was created in 2006, but took off in 2007. In 2007, Hadoop, the most important software you’ve never heard of, began expanding the ability of any company to store and analyse enormous amounts of unstructured data. This helped enable Big Data and cloud computing. Indeed, “the cloud” really took off in 2007. In 2007, the Kindle kicked off the e-book revolution and Google introduced Android. In 2007, IBM started Watson — the world’s first cognitive computer that today can understand virtually every paper ever written on cancer and suggest to doctors highly accurate diagnoses and treatment options. And have you ever looked at a graph of the cost of sequencing a human genome? It goes from $100 million in the early 2000s and begins to fall dramatically starting around … 2007. The cost of making solar panels began to decline sharply in 2007. Airbnb was conceived in 2007 and change.org started in 2007. GitHub, now the world’s largest open-source software sharing library, was opened in 2007. And in 2007 Intel for the first time introduced non-Silicon materials into its microchip transistors, thus extending the duration of Moore’s Law — the expectation that the power of microchips would double roughly every two years. As a result, the exponential growth in computing power continues to this day. Finally, in 2006, the internet crossed well over a billion users worldwide. In time, 2007 may be seen as one of the greatest technological inflection points in history. And we completely missed it. Why? 2008. Yes, right when our physical technologies leapt ahead, many of what Oxford economist Eric Beinhocker calls our “social technologies” — all of the rules, regulations, institutions and social tools people needed to get the most out of this technological acceleration and cushion the worst — froze or lagged. In the best of times social technologies have a hard time keeping up with physical technologies, but with the Great Recession of 2008 and the political paralysis it engendered, this gap turned into a chasm. A lot of people got dislocated in the process. How could they not? What happened around 2007 was that connectivity and computing got so fast, cheap, ubiquitous and leveraged that they changed three forms of power — in really differentiated ways — all at once: the power of one, the power of machines and the power of ideas. What one individual or small group can now do — the power of one — to make or break things is phenomenal. When Trump wants to be heard he now gets his message out directly from his New York penthouse through Twitter to 15 million-plus followers at any hour of the day he pleases. And the Islamic State does the same from a remote province in Syria. Machines can now not only beat humans at “Jeopardy!” or chess, they are starting to become truly creative, offering architectural and other designs and writing news stories, songs and poetry that are indistinguishable from the work of humans. At the same time, ideas now flow digitally through social networks all over the world faster and farther than ever. As a result, new ideas (including fake news) can suddenly take root, and long-held ideas — think opposition to gay marriage or transgender rights — can suddenly melt away. So if you look down from 30,000 feet you see that technology, globalisation and, I would add, Mother Nature (in particular, climate change, biodiversity loss and the impact of population growth) are all accelerating at the same time, and feeding off one another: More Moore’s Law drives more globalisation and more globalisation drives more climate change. And together, climate change and digital connectivity drive more human migration. I recently met with economic and climate refugees in West Africa who made it clear to me they didn’t want aid from a rock concert in Europe. They want to come to the Europe they see on their cellphones — and they are using WhatsApp to organise vast illicit migration networks to get there. So no wonder many in the West feel unmoored. The two things that anchored them in the world — their community and their job — are feeling destabilised. They go to the grocery store and someone there speaks to them in a different language or is wearing a head covering. They go into the men’s room and there is someone next to them who looks to be of a different gender. They go to work and there’s now a robot sitting next to them who seems to be studying their job. I celebrate this diversity of people and ideas — but for many others they’ve come faster than they can adapt. That’s why my favourite song these days is Brandi Carlile’s wonderful ballad called “The Eye,” the main verse of which is: “I wrapped your love around me like a chain/ But I never was afraid that it would die/ You can dance in a hurricane/ But only if you’re standing in the eye.” These accelerations in technology, globalisation and Mother Nature are like a hurricane in which we’re all being asked to dance. Trump and the Brexiters sensed the anxiety of many and promised to build a wall against these howling winds of change. I disagree. I think the challenge is to find the eye. For me, that translates into building healthy communities that are flexible enough to move with these accelerations, draw energy from them — but also provide a platform of dynamic stability for citizens within them. More on that another day. ― The New York Times * This is the personal opinion of the columnist.                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week It looks like the Red Shirts are here to stay Dancing in a hurricane ― Thomas L.

Sure, you’ve got a range of options within the two, but when you get down to it, that’s the big choice you’re making. Aside from the shape of the controller and the occasional exclusive game, it doesn’t matter whether the box under your TV is a PlayStation or an Xbox. Similarly, every PC sits under your desk, makes a whirring sound, and has Steam installed. Consoles are always cheaper than PCs up front, but there’s more to the cost of a gaming set up than just the initial sticker price. You’ve got to buy a steady stream of games and, potentially, subscribe to an online service. What do these costs look like in real terms? If you’re looking to invest in a new gaming setup in 2017, how much is it really going to cost you? Sure, consoles are cheaper (that’s just not up for debate), but how much cheaper are they? Let’s dig in and find out. What Does a Gaming PC Cost Anyway?

Sure, that might be the popular image of what a gaming PC should be, but it isn’t what they have to be.

You don’t need to invest $2,500 to be able to play the latest games, but you’re still paying a lot more than for a console. Let’s set a base PC price of just under $900. That’s a lot of money, but it’s not so much that people who are really serious about gaming wouldn’t consider spending it. It’s a bit more than a good work PC, but it’s nowhere near Mac Pro money Who Really Needs A Mac Pro? Who Really Needs A Mac Pro? If you've thought of buying a Mac Pro, you may want to reconsider.

Read More . A good PC build should be able to last five years. That’s slightly less than a full console generation, but by the end of the PlayStation 3’s life, it had fallen far behind PCs in gaming ability. It wasn’t even a competition at that stage. Halfway through your PC’s life, you’ll probably need to upgrade your RAM, throw in a new graphics card, and so on, so let’s budget another $300 for that. That means the lifetime cost of our reasonably priced gaming PC is $1,200. What About the Consoles? The starting price of a console is a lot cheaper than a gaming PC. Right now on Amazon, a Playstation 4 Pro is going for $399 [CDN$ 499.96/£332] and an Xbox One S is about $349.99 [CDN$ 379.96] depending on the bundle you pick. Let’s assume the same 5 year life for a console. Sure, it’s not a full generation, but we’re a few years into the current one. The only upgrade available for a console is a new hard drive, but there’s no real need to factor that in; most people won’t need one. Sony PlayStation 4 Pro - 1TB Sony PlayStation 4 Pro - 1TB Spectacular graphics - Explore vivid game worlds with rich visuals heightened by PS4 Pro. Buy Now At Amazon $380.00 The big extra cost is online gaming. On a PC, it’s essentially free — as long as you’re not signed up to a MMORPG. On consoles, however, it isn’t. Both PlayStation Plus and Xbox Live Gold cost $59.99 a year. Over a five year console lifespan, that’s an extra $300. And that’s if you buy annually — if you’re subscribed monthly, it’s $9.99 each month for a total cost of just under $600. Xbox One S 2TB Console - Launch Edition Xbox One S 2TB Console - Launch Edition Includes: 2TB Internal Hard Drive Xbox One S Console, 1 Xbox Wireless Controller (with 3.5mm headset jack), 1 Console Stand (for vertical orientation), HDMI cable (4K Capable), AC Power cable, and a 14-day Xbox Live Gold Trial. Buy Now At Amazon $375.95 That puts the total price of a PlayStation 4 at $698.95 and an Xbox one at $649.94. Or up to a max of $998.40 and $949.39 respectively if you’re paying for online services on a monthly basis. Even assuming the worst case, you’re still coming in a few hundred dollars cheaper than our PC. In the best case, a console costs just over half the cost of the PC. Does the Cost of Games Matter? It used to be the case that PC games cost $10 to $20 less than the equivalent on a console. That was because Sony and Microsoft took a cut of every game sold for their platform. Now, for whatever reason, the situation has changed: AAA games cost the same across all three platforms. I checked out some of this year’s biggest releases — games like Dishonored 2, Call of Duty: Infinite War, and Watch Dogs 2 — and all the games cost around $59.99 on every platform. Sure, there’s the odd saving of $0.07 here and $0.03 there, but for the most part it’s $60 flat if you want a new AAA game. If you’re interested in indie titles, you’re always going to have more options on a PC. Releasing a game through Steam is simple compared to trying to get one into Sony or Microsoft’s stores. There are countless smaller games that cost just a few dollars which are available on a PC but not on a console. Offers, like Humble Bundles, make it even easier to pick up cheap titles. The thing is, it’s impossible to compare like with like. If you just play indie games on your PC and someone else only plays AAA titles on their PS4, your lifetime cost for the system might end up lower. But if they mainly play used games while you pick up every major title, you’ll spend three times the money they do. The other complicating factor is that both PlayStation Plus and Xbox Live Gold offer their members free games to play. While you don’t get to pick the titles, there’s a steady stream of awesome games available to play for no extra cost. There are also regular sales through the online stores. The prices might never drop as low as they do on Steam, but you can still regularly pick up awesome older console games for under ten bucks. When it comes down to it, AAA games cost the same where ever you play them and there are cheap options available for every platform. If you mainly want to play indie games because you prefer them, buy a PC, but don’t get one just because you think it will save you money on games in the long run. The Cost of Virtual Reality Gaming is about to change. Over the last few years, virtual reality has gone from fantasy to fantastically awful to functional Virtual Reality Still Has 5 Big Problems to Overcome Virtual Reality Still Has 5 Big Problems to Overcome Despite all of the hype surrounding the recent surge in virtual reality products, there are many challenges that still need to be addressed before VR goes mainstream.

The prices are obviously going to fall as VR becomes more available, but it’s clear that it’s not magically going to be cheaper on PC. If anything, the console manufacturer’s economies of scale will let them offer VR headsets at a lower price. Other Uses Both games consoles and gaming PCs have other uses outside of playing games: you can use a PS4 or Xbox One as a media center and a gaming PC, is still a fully functioning PC. Since your games console is already plugged into your TV, it makes sense to set up Netflix or whatever streaming services you subscribe to on it. They work well as media centers, although they aren’t quite as intuitive as a Roku or Apple TV. If you just need a way to stream stuff for yourself and other tech-capable people, using your games console will save you a hundred bucks on a set top box. On the other hand, a PC is still a PC. If you want, you can do all your regular computer stuff on your gaming rig. Unfortunately, though, gaming PCs make terrible day to day computers. Unless you’re editing photos or videos, they are massively over powered for most tasks — a video card does very little except run up your electricity bill when you’re on Facebook.

You’ll have a dedicated games system and a lightweight flexible PC you can carry around with you. Adding Things Up Whatever way you slice it, games consoles are a cheaper way to play games than gaming PCs. Even a moderately-priced system has a lifetime cost of about twice that of consoles. Sure, you can build a super-cheap rig but it will go out of date faster than the milk in your fridge. If budget and being able to play the latest AAA games are your only concerns, buy a console. I have a PS4 and I couldn’t be happier with it. That’s not to say PCs don’t have a lot going for them. If you love indie games or maxed-out specs, they’re the best way to get them. But don’t kid yourself into thinking you’re somehow saving money because after finishing up gaming you can open a spreadsheet. Gaming PCs have always been, and continue to be, a terrible financial investment. Do you agree or disagree with us? Would you invest more money for a good gaming PC?

Not that the article does not have its merits, it's well written and intriguing. Only, PC is so much more than any console...yes, games are released for both systems but quality is quite different (depends on the quality of your PC actually). If you don't have much money to spend, get a console. If you want quality and have the money for it, get a PC. Me? Powerful PC + Nintendo Switch (when it will be out, it will be different in gaming experience than my PC). Thank you for reading.

First Read: The Trouble With Mike Flynn Late last night, NBC's Kristen Welker confirmed that President-elect Donald Trump asked retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn to serve as his national security adviser. (The news was first reported by the AP.) But the controversies and ethical baggage around Flynn are problematic. For starters, there are Flynn's statements about Islam and Muslims. "Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL: please forward this to others: the truth fears no questions," he tweeted back in February. Critics have argued that Flynn is too cozy to Russia, pointing to a trip to Moscow in which he spent time with Vladimir Putin, as well as a paid speaking engagement with state-run Russia Today. There are questions about his management style, given that he was fired as DIA director, as Welker reported on "Today." And then there is last night's report from Yahoo, which said he began receiving national security briefings last summer while still advising foreign clients. "Flynn's relationship with his overseas clients is coming in for new scrutiny amid recent disclosures that two months ago, during the height of the presidential campaign, his consulting firm, the Flynn Intel Group, registered to lobby for a Dutch company owned by a wealthy Turkish businessman close to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey." Andrew Kaczynski/CNN: On Twitter, Michael Flynn interacted with alt-right, made controversial comments on Muslims, shared fake news A CNN KFile review of Flynn's Twitter account finds that the retired lieutenant general, who once served as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, tweeted routinely with members of the so-called alt-right movement, going so far as to endorse a book by one controversial figure who regularly makes offensive comments. Flynn faced criticism in July when he retweeted an anti-Semitic message. Flynn said the retweet was an accident and deleted the message. Emails to a spokesperson for President-elect Trump and Flynn seeking comment were not returned. A follow up question to Flynn asking who managed his Twitter account also went unreturned. The GOP owns this now. All of it. Maclean’s: As anger and disbelief metabolized into action and activism, an iconography of protest emerged: Post-It notes offering supportive messages were plastered in subway stations and on school washroom mirrors; the safety pin, adopted as a symbol in Australia in 2014 and in post-Brexit U.K. to signal alliance with vulnerable groups, popped up on lapels and social media avatars. Safety pins, denounced by some as merely a “feel good” gesture, weren’t the only gesture denoting fear of what was to come. Non-profits protecting Trump’s avowed targets—civil liberties, women’s reproductive rights, immigrants, the LGBTQ community, the environment, press freedom—saw a spike in donations, aided by sites like Jezebel’s list of “Pro-women, pro-immigrant, pro-Earth, anti-bigotry organizations that need your support.” Within 24 hours, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) received a record high in online donations of some $940,000, a tally that now stands at more than $7.2 million. Trump has become a poster boy for the ACLU, which published a harsh message for the president-elect, promising its “full firepower” should he seek to undermine the Constitution. Its homepage reads: “See you in court,” next to Trump’s photo and a “donate” button. Modern Healthcare: The incoming Donald Trump administration and Republicans in Congress reportedly are rushing to repeal most of the Affordable Care Act within days of taking office, with a possible delay of a year or two while they craft a replacement package. They're also discussing quick administrative moves to unravel the ACA, such as terminating payments to insurers that compensate them for reducing cost-sharing requirements for lower-income exchange plan members. But pro-ACA experts and some insurers warn that repealing the law without passing a replacement, combined with administrative actions undermining the law, could prompt health plans to abandon the individual insurance markets in 2018. That's because insurers have to calculate and submit their 2018 premiums by spring, and that task will be difficult or impossible if they don't know the rules of the new Republican-led system. The turmoil likely would affect both the exchange and off-exchange markets, through which nearly 20 million Americans get coverage, they say. "I would not be surprised by a stampede to exit the market for fear of uncertainty and the strong potential for adverse selection,” said Mike Kreidler, Washington state's insurance commissioner, at a news conference Wednesday organized by the liberal Center for American Progress. Kreidler said he's already gotten calls from nervous insurance leaders and plans to meet soon with the CEOs of the three major insurers in his state, where half a million people have gotten coverage under the ACA. Here, from the Telegraph, is something both campaigns agree on: FBI's decision to reopen Clinton email probe enabled Donald Trump to win election, says former aide Corey Lewandowski Norm Ornstein/WaPo: Donald Trump’s choice of alt-right leader Stephen K. Bannon as top White House strategist suggests that the worst instincts of the president-elect remain intact. The hopes for governance hewing closer to the center, and respecting all those living in the United States, rest with the Senate, and with the behavior and outlook of senators in both parties. For Senate Republicans, this is a critical moment to heed a call their colleague Lindsey Graham (S.C.) made earlier in the campaign — there is a time to put country ahead of party. Reflexive party loyalty now, including blindly confirming all of Trump’s executive and judicial nominees, would violate that maxim. Republicans need to vet thoroughly and firmly all nominees, but especially those who violate basic standards of moderation, civility and respect for constitutional norms. That means racially divisive and bombastic figures such as Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke, who stunningly called on his allies during the campaign to ready their “pitchforks and torches,” and who has been rumored to be Trump’s top choice for homeland security secretary, should be rejected. Paul Waldman/WaPo: Why the filibuster may survive after all — and limit the damage congressional Republicans can do The narrowness of the Republican majority means that Democrats would need only a couple of Republicans to vote with them to deny the GOP the 51 votes it needs to institute a change in Senate rules. And now at least four Republican senators have gone on record saying that the filibuster should stay. Lindsey Graham said emphatically that ending the filibuster would be “a horrible, terrible idea.” Orrin Hatch was even more categorical. “Are you kidding?” he responded when asked by the Huffington Post’s Michael McAuliff whether it should be eliminated. “I’m one of the biggest advocates for the filibuster. It’s the only way to protect the minority, and we’ve been in the minority a lot more than we’ve been in the majority.” And NBC’s Benjy Sarlin reports that Jeff Flake and Jim Inhofe both told him the filibuster should stay. 336 Comments Share this article 123 123 123 336 Comments Comment Settings Close Settings Auto refresh Collapse on load Show hidden Show until I hide Comments are closed on this story.

Reuters/Lucy Nicholson Latest reports suggest that Apple is not likely to release the iPhone 8 before September 2017. The company may in the meantime release the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus. It’s been just more than a couple of months since Apple released its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. However, rumours are already on about the next-gen iPhone. As per reports, the Apple iPhone 8 could have a bigger OLED curved display. The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus may have 5 and 5.8-inch displays respectively. Apple could be using a bezel-less display to conform to the size of the handset. As per Macworld, Apple did apply for a patent in March 2015 for a bezel-less device. As far other specs are concerned, nothing is known about next year’s Apple iPhone 8 though the company may tie up with Intel for manufacturing the processor for the iPhone 8. There is no rivalry between Apple and Intel. Hence, Apple may choose to shift some of its orders there. It will also be in line with Washington’s policy of encouraging US companies to make products at home. Apple is known for using the best cameras for its smartphones. It also got a patent for a digital camera with light splitter. Thus, this new technology could be incorporated into the Apple iPhone 8 camera. This feature is generally available to professional video cameras. The technology is believed to produce excellent photos even in low light conditions. These are merely rumours and it will be interesting to see whether Apple really introduced these new features in its iPhone 8. Apple is also said to be working with Energous to introduce the wireless-charging technology to Apple iPhone 8. The iPhone can be successfully charged if the owner is within 15 feet of the transmitter, writes BGR.

 10 things you need to know in markets today Oscar Williams-Grut Nov. 16, 2016, 1:48 AM 388 facebook linkedin twitter email print A man walks through a garden on an autumn day in Srinagar, India November 15, 2016. REUTERS/Danish Ismail Good morning! Here's what you need to know in markets on Wednesday. EU antitrust regulators are set to fine HSBC, JPMorgan, and Credit Agricole by the end of the year for rigging financial benchmarks linked to the euro, two people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. Reuters reports that charges were levied in May 2014 against the three banks, which denied wrongdoing. The European Commission could penalise HSBC, JPMorgan, and Credit Agricole next month, the people said. The decision has been delayed several times and another hold-up could still occur. Google still plans to open a new UK headquarters building in London, which the BBC reports could create up to 3,000 jobs in the country by 2020. Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google, told the BBC the company sees "big opportunities" in the UK despite the country's vote to exit the European Union in June. Employment and wage data is coming. UK earnings and job figures for September and October are due at 9.30 a.m. GMT (4.30 a.m. ET). The unemployment rate is forecast to remain steady at 4.9% and wage growth is forecast to be 2.3%, the same as in the prior month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied for a seventh straight day on Tuesday, clinching another record closing high overnight near 19,000. The rout in the bond market finally paused as traders bought Treasurys, sending yields lower for the first time since last week's election. Japan's Nikkei hit a 9 and a half month high. The Japanese stock market closed up 1.1% at its highest level since February, buoyed by the weak yen helping exporters. Elsewhere in Asia, China's Shanghai Composite is down 0.07% at the time of writing (6.25 a.m. GMT/1.25 a.m. ET) and the Hong Kong Hang Seng is up 0.45%. Saudi Arabia will reveal how much oil it is sitting on as it prepares to sell shares in Saudi Aramco. "This is going to be the most transparent national oil company listing of all time," Khalid al-Falih, Saudi Arabia’s energy minister, told the Financial Times in an interview. Intel will invest more than $250 million (£200 million) to make autonomous driving a reality. Intel wrote in a press release that the investment will be geared toward advancing tech related to connectivity, communication, deep learning, and cybersecurity for cars. Deutsche Bank has shaken up some of its senior ranks in its US investment bank. The firm has promoted Michael Santini to vice chairman of Americas corporate finance and John Anos to cohead of global industrials alongside Richard Sheppard. Senior Morgan Stanley executives collectively earned about $10.5 million (£8.4 million) over the past week by exercising options and selling shares, with most of them profiting from an election-fueled rally in bank stocks, according to securities filings. The executives made the sales after shares of Morgan Stanley, which traded as low as $22 in the last 12 months, reversed course to become the best performing of the six largest US banks so far this year, closing Monday at $39.35. An aggressive tax avoidance scheme used by temp recruitment agencies is depriving the taxpayer of “hundreds of millions” of pounds a year, a Guardian investigation has found. A number of agencies have been making large windfalls by using “contrived” financial arrangements to slash their employer’s national insurance bills.

Could a similar problem be brewing this year for Apple’s iPhone 7? It’s certainly starting to look that way. According to a report from Bloomberg, it seems that researchers at Twin Prime Inc. and Cellular Insights have found that the iPhone 7 on Verizon’s networking isn’t performing as fast as it could, and it could be Apple’s own doing. The researchers have found that testing the phones on AT&T and Verizon’s network yielded similar results, but they also note that the iPhone on Verizon’s network could potentially hit higher internet speeds. If you might recall, it has been discovered that depending on which carrier you use, your iPhone’s modem could either be made by Qualcomm or Intel. Qualcomm’s modem is supposed to be faster with download speeds of up to 600Mb/s, while Intel’s model tops out at 450Mb/s. This means in theory Verizon’s iPhone should be capable of achieving faster download speeds. However some analysts speculate that maybe this was done on purpose to ensure a uniform experience across all iPhones, although right now we’re sure that some iPhone users probably aren’t too thrilled to learn that their iPhones could be artificially limited in some way. According to Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller, “Every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple’s wireless performance standards, quality metrics, and reliability testing. In all of our rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards, in thousands of hours of real-world field testing, and in extensive carrier partner testing, the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models.” Filed in Apple >Cellphones.

The retired Army general has been named to a top post in Trump's Cabinet. Getty By Helin Jung Nov 19, 2016 Retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn announced on Friday that he had accepted the position of national security adviser, formally known as the assistant to the President for national security affairs (APNSA). The role does not require a Senate confirmation. President-elect Donald Trump relied heavily on Flynn, a three-star general with 33 years of experience in the military, during his campaign, and had considered Flynn for the running mate job before selecting Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana. Flynn, 57, remained extremely loyal to Trump and has been rewarded for it. Along with Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, Flynn was present on Thursday when Trump met with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below As national security adviser, Flynn will offer daily national security briefings to the president, among other duties. Here's what you need to know about Flynn: 1. He is a registered Democrat. Raised in Rhode Island, Flynn comes from "an Irish Catholic family of blue-collar Democrats," according to Politico, and was a lifelong Democrat before throwing his support behind the Republican candidate. "I grew up as a Democrat in a very strong Democratic family, he told ABC, "but I will tell you that Democratic party that exists in this country is not the Democratic party that I grew up around in my upbringing." 2. He had an impressive military career. Flynn joined the Army in 1981. He served in Afghanistan and Iraq as the director of intelligence for Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), which includes unites like SEAL Team 6. He was then the director of intelligence for the United States Central Command and the director of intelligence for the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, helping to dismantle al-Qaeda networks. President Barack Obama nominated him to be the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency — the CIA of the Pentagon — in 2012. Getty 3. He was ousted from his role as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014. Flynn was forced to resign after two years in his post, pushed out by the undersecretary of defense for intelligence and the director of national intelligence. He wrote in the New York Post that he had been trying to "change the culture of DIA." Flynn added, "After being fired, I left the meeting thinking, 'Here we are in the middle of a war, I had a significant amount of combat experience (nearly five years) against this determined enemy on the battlefield and served at senior levels, and here it was, the bureaucracy was letting me go.' Amazing." Meanwhile, leaked emails revealed that former Secretary of State Colin Powell had asked why the now "right-wing nutty" Flynn was fired. "Abusive with staff, didn't listen, worked against policy, bad management, etc." Powell wrote. Shortly after leaving the DIA, Flynn became a vocal critic of Obama. This was looked upon with disapproval by former colleagues. According to Vox, there is a direct connection between his "enmity towards Obama and Clinton" and "his abrupt dismissal from the DIA." He told Foreign Policy, "I'm not going to be a general that just fades away." Getty Advertisement - Continue Reading Below 4. After getting fired, he started a consulting firm called Flynn Intel Group, which is now the source of numerous conflicts of interest. Flynn started getting classified national security briefings over the summer while he was still consulting international clients on intelligence matters, according to Yahoo News. Flynn Intel Group also appears to be lobbying for the Turkish government, and has reportedly been paid thousands of dollars for it. Flynn is also an ally of Palantir, the data analysis company co-founded by Peter Thiel, the Republican billionaire who took down Gawker and gave $1.25 million to the Trump campaign. In a letter addressed to Vice President-elect Pence, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, who sits on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, wrote, "Lt. Gen. Flynn's involvement in advising Mr. Trump on matters relating to Turkey or Russia — including attending classified briefings on those matters — could violate the Trump for America, Inc. Code of Ethical Conduct ..." which promises that individuals working with Trump will "disqualify" themselves should there be any conflicts of interest. 5. Early in the race, he advised five Republican presidential candidates before siding with Trump. Flynn said that he had spoken to Carly Fiorina, Scott Walker, Ben Carson Ted Cruz, and Trump but was ultimately most impressed with Trump, someone who, like himself, he sees as an outsider who speaks bluntly. "This is a guy that provides a different vision, a different way to solve problems, a different leadership style, and a sense of change that I believe that a majority of people in this country are really starting to look at," he told CNN. After the election, Flynn was ecstatic. "We just went through a revolution," he said. "This is probably the biggest election in our nation's history, since bringing on George Washington when he decided not to be a king." Getty 6. He encouraged a "lock her up" chant while speaking at the Republican National Convention. Like Trump, Flynn has been highly critical of Hillary Clinton's emails. "I have called on Hillary Clinton to drop out of the race because she — she — put our nation's security at extremely high risk with her careless use of a private email server," he said. "Lock her up. Lock her up! Damn right. Exactly right. There's nothing wrong with that!" On two separate occasions, the FBI concluded that Clinton should not face criminal prosecution for her use of her private email server, but Trump has not conclusively said that he would drop the possibility of prosecuting Clinton. The Democratic lawyer Richard Ben-Veniste told the New York Times that such action "would be mimicking the tin-pot dictators of historical disgrace who seek to punish those who have run against them." Advertisement - Continue Reading Below 7. Military officials condemn Flynn's partisanship. Adm. Michael Mullen, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Washington Post in a statement that Flynn's behavior in the election broke code (Mullen was equally critical of Clinton supporter retired Marine Corps General John Allen). "For retired senior officers to take leading and vocal roles as clearly partisan figures is a violation of the ethos and professionalism of apolitical military service." Two retired officers told Vox that they found Flynn to be "unhinged." 8. He has made numerous Islamophobic statements. In an interview with Al Jazeera in May, Flynn did not denounce Trump's Muslim ban, but he did say that "There must be more precision in the use of the language that he uses as the potential leader of the free world." For his part, Flynn has broadly painted Islam as "a cancer" and has said that "Islam is a political ideology masked behind a religion," shoehorning the world's 1.6 billion Muslims together in language that The Intercept described as showing a "lack of precision," the very critique Flynn had of Trump. Flynn strongly believes that "radical Islamic terrorism" is the single biggest threat to Americans. He is the co-author of a book called The Field of Fight: How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and Its Allies. In another Al Jazeera interview, Flynn said, "I've been at war with Islam, or a, or a component of Islam, for the last decade." He tweeted in February that "fear of Muslims is RATIONAL" and though the tweet has been repeatedly criticized, Flynn has not backtracked or taken it down. Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL: please forward this to others: the truth fears no questions... https://t.co/NLIfKFD9lU— General Flynn (@GenFlynn) February 27, 2016 9. He hates "political correctness." "Political correctness kills. It will cause death, and we can’t have that," he said on Fox & Friends in September. Flynn has also said, "My God, war is not about bathrooms. War is not about political correctness or words that are meaningless. War is about winning." 10. His position on torture is just shy of an endorsement. Flynn was once against waterboarding, but has softened his stance since aligning with Trump, who has said that he would allow waterboarding and that "torture works, OK, folks?" Flynn claims that as an intelligence officer in Iraq, he helped end abusive interrogation practices. "We were going by the book," he told The Intercept. But instead of renouncing the use of torture or the committing of war crimes, Flynn said this about Trump's statements: "Here's what a guy like Donald Trump is doing: He's basically saying, 'Hey, look, all options are on the table,' and being very unpredictable in the face of a very determined enemy." Human Rights Watch says that Flynn shows "a stunning contempt for the Geneva Conventions and other laws prohibiting torture." Getty Advertisement - Continue Reading Below 11. He appears to be cozy with Russia and Vladimir Putin. "Russia presents the greatest threat to our national security," the Marine Corps Gen. Joseph Dunford, Jr. said in July during his confirmation to be the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In an interview with NPR, Flynn seemed to agree, saying that enemies of the United States included, "certainly, Russia, North Korea, Iran, Venezuela, countries like Cuba, certainly China." Yet Flynn traveled to Moscow on a paid trip in 2015, appearing on RT, Russia's state-run news organization. He likened RT to CNN. "It was a paid speaking opportunity," Flynn told the Washington Post. "I get paid so much." Flynn was seated very close to Putin at a gala, and called the symbolism of it "boring," saying that he "didn't have any problem" with the optics. According to Politico in May, Flynn had continued to make "semi-regular appearances on RT as an analyst." 12. He used to be pro-choice but flip-flopped immediately after his views were criticized by conservatives. Flynn said on ABC that "Abortion, I think for women, these are difficult issues. I think that's a difficult legal decision, and I think that women are so important in that decision-making process. They are the ones that have to make the decision because they are the ones that will decide to bring up that child or not." He later "clarified" to Fox News that he was a "pro-life Democrat" and that "I believe the law should be changed." Getty 13. He had to apologize for a sexist dress code presentation that went out to employees while he was at the DIA. In January 2013, DIA employees were provided a presentation on dress code (obtained by MuckRock through a Freedom of Information request). Male and female employees were advised on how to "look sharp, feel sharp, be sharp" in their professional appearance. But there was a sexist bent to the section for women. "Do not advocate the 'Plain Jane' look," the presentation said. "Makeup helps women look more attractive." It also said that women should "consider your body type" when choosing clothing, and "accentuate the positive/disguise the negative." Flynn later apologized in an email to his staff. "I've now seen [the presentation] and I too find it highly offensive," he said. He listed what it really takes to be successful (makeup was not on there) and said that "Neither the agency nor I condone this briefing and I only hope the intention to execute this task was pure of heart and intended to help ... but even smart people do dumb things sometimes."

Flynn, has a tendency to post bogus news stories and bigoted statements on social media. The younger Flynn works for Flynn Intel Group and is his father's chief of staff, according to CNN. "Unfortunately, only reason minorities voted for BO is the color of his skin and NOT for the issues," he wrote in a tweet during the 2012 election. He reportedly deleted the post after CNN asked him to comment, but the news outlet captured the tweet in a screenshot before it got taken down. CNN also pointed out that the younger Flynn wrote on Facebook in early November that Gloria Allred was a "commie" trying to "get the heat off the witch." Son and father seemingly have this quality in common. While at the DIA, Flynn was "so prone to dubious pronouncements," according to the Washington Post, that these statements had a name: "Flynn facts." Business Insider reported that Lt. Gen. Flynn has promoted conspiracies that Hillary Clinton was involved in "sex crimes with children" and "money laundering." He also suggested that Hillary Clinton had conspired with Jews in an anti-Semitic tweet (he retweeted the statement "Not anymore, Jews. Not anymore") that he later deleted and apologized for. 15. Flynn told women in his office to wear makeup, heels, and skirts. Women in the Defense Intelligence Agency were told to monitor their levels of makeup, avoid flats, and err on the side of skirts and dresses when the organization was run by Flynn.

developer Jump to content Desktop Phone IoT Community Overview App development training Core apps Blog Publish My Apps Search Community › Blog › 2016 › How to create Snap packages of Qt applications Introduction One of the advantages of snap packages is that they are self-contained. When you install a snap, you know that you don’t need to install additional dependencies (besides the automatically-installed core snap that provides the basic operating system layer), and it will simply work on every Linux distribution that supports snaps. Here, we show how to create self-contained snap packages for Qt-based applications, and we show an additional approach where some of the app dependencies are provided by a separate snap: the Ubuntu app platform snap. The platform snap provides an (optional) approach for the software provider, and can save disk space in some cases. Below we will explain the two approaches to building a snap for Qt-based software: a snap that is self-contained and includes Qt, and one that uses the platform snap, and we show the advantages of each approach. However, before showing these two approaches that you can apply to your own QML code, we demonstrate how to create a snap from deb packages in the Ubuntu archive so that you can get started right away even before you write any code. We assume that before reading this blog post, you have acquired knowledge about how to use Snapcraft. So if you haven’t, we recommend reading the documentation on snapcraft.io and the snap-codelabs tutorials. All the commands that are listed below are executed on an Ubuntu 16.04 LTS machine with the stable-phone-overlay PPA enabled. Some of the snapcraft commands may run on other configurations, but for the “Ubuntu App Platform Snap” section it is a hard requirement because the version of Qt - upstream 5.6 long term support version - and other libraries used to build the snap need to match the versions in the ubuntu-app-platform snap. Installing the snap packages works on different versions of Ubuntu and even different Linux distributions. The examples were tested on amd64 architecture with Intel graphics. If you are running this on a different CPU architecture, naturally the architecture in the directory and snap file names listed below must be modified. If you have an Nvidia GPU and use the Nvidia proprietary drivers there can be problems when running some snapped applications, so in that case we currently recommend to use the open source Nouveau drivers. The examples are also available in a repository linked to from the Evaluation section. Qt cloud parts - a simple use case We will demonstrate how to build a simple app snap that includes the Qt release and Ubuntu UI Toolkit (UITK) from the Ubuntu archives. For this example, we use the UITK gallery which is part of the ubuntu-ui-toolkit-examples deb package on classic Ubuntu systems, so no additional code is needed. Because of that, we can simply use the nil plugin and pull in the examples as stage-packages. We create a directory called uitk-gallery which contains only a snapcraft.yaml file with the following contents: 
name: uitk-gallery
version: '0.1'
summary: Showcase gallery that demonstrates the components in the Ubuntu UI Toolkit.
description: |
  See https://developer.ubuntu.com/api/qml/ for the API documentation of the components.

grade: devel
confinement: strict

parts:
  ubuntu-ui-toolkit-examples:
    plugin: nil
    stage-packages:
      - qmlscene
      - qml-module-qtqml-models2
      - ubuntu-ui-toolkit-examples
    after: [desktop-qt5]

apps:
  uitk-gallery:
    command: desktop-launch "qmlscene $SNAP/usr/lib/*/qt5/examples/ubuntu-ui-toolkit/examples/ubuntu-ui-toolkit-gallery/ubuntu-ui-toolkit-gallery.qml"
    plugs: [unity7, opengl]
 (notes: the command line assumes you are on and targeting amd64 system. the plugs line is needed so that you have access to graphical subsystem from your confined app) Under stage-packages we listed all the packages that need to be pulled from the Ubuntu archive, including their dependencies. ubuntu-ui-toolkit-examples contains all the QML code for the UITK gallery that we want to run using qmlscene. We also included qml-module-qtqml-models2 because some pages of the UITK gallery import QtQml.Models. The line after: [desktop-qt5] fetches the desktop-qt5 part from the remote parts repository. It will automatically pull in Qt 5 from the Ubuntu archive, set-up environment variables, and provide the desktop-launch script that is called to start the app. The snap file can be created simply by going to the uitk-gallery directory which contains the snapcraft.yaml file, and running: 
snapcraft Note that Snapcraft will ask for the sudo password to install the Qt5 dev packages that are required to compile Qt apps, but can be left out if all the dependencies are already present. Running snapcraft will create (on an amd64 machine) the file uitk-gallery_0.1_amd64.snap which can then be installed by: 
snap install --dangerous uitk-gallery_0.1_amd64.snap where the dangerous parameter is required because we are installing an unsigned snap that does not come from the Ubuntu store. Note that you do not need to use sudo if you have logged in with snap login. The UITK gallery can now be launched using: 
uitk-gallery The desktop-qt5 cloud part pulls in the current stable version of Qt of the Ubuntu 16.04 LTS release - 5.5.1 normally or 5.6.1 in the case of stable overlay PPA. To uninstall the UITK gallery snap before going to the next section, run: 
snap remove uitk-gallery QML project using parts from the cloud If your existing QML code is not available as a deb package, then obviously you cannot pull it in from the archive when creating the snap using stage-packages. To show how to include your own QML code, we copy the UITK gallery code to the ubuntu-ui-toolkit-gallery directory inside the snapcraft (uitk-gallery) directory. Go to the parent directory of the uitk-gallery of the previous section, and run: 
bzr branch lp:ubuntu-ui-toolkit
cp -R ubuntu-ui-toolkit/examples/ubuntu-ui-toolkit-gallery uitk-gallery/ Alternatively, if you have the ubuntu-ui-toolkit-examples package installed, you can run: 
cp -R /usr/lib/*/qt5/examples/ubuntu-ui-toolkit/examples/ubuntu-ui-toolkit-gallery/ uitk-gallery/ You should now have both the snapcraft.yaml and the copied ubuntu-ui-toolkit-gallery directory that contains the source code of the UITK gallery under the uitk-gallery. We can now remove the ubuntu-ui-toolkit-examples from the stage-packages in the snapcraft.yaml file. Because that line is removed, the dependencies of the UITK gallery are no longer pulled in automatically, and we must add them to the YAML file, which then becomes: 
name: uitk-gallery
version: '0.2'
summary: Showcase gallery that demonstrates the components in the Ubuntu UI Toolkit.
description: |
  See https://developer.ubuntu.com/api/qml/ for the API documentation of the components.

grade: devel
confinement: strict

parts:
  ubuntu-ui-toolkit-gallery:
    plugin: dump
    source: .
    stage-packages:
      - qmlscene
      - qml-module-qtqml-models2
      - qml-module-qt-labs-folderlistmodel
      - qml-module-qtquick-xmllistmodel
      - qml-module-ubuntu-components
      - ubuntu-ui-toolkit-theme
      - ubuntu-ui-toolkit-tools
    after: [desktop-qt5]

apps:
  uitk-gallery:
    command: desktop-launch "qmlscene $SNAP/ubuntu-ui-toolkit-gallery/ubuntu-ui-toolkit-gallery.qml"
    plugs: [unity7, opengl]
 Note that besides the changes in stage-packages, also the location of ubuntu-ui-toolkit-gallery.qml was updated in the uitk-gallery command because the QML files are no longer installed in usr/lib inside the snap, but copied in the root of the snap filesystem. As before, the snap package can be created by executing: 
snapcraft inside the uitk-gallery directory. The UITK gallery can then be installed and started using: 
snap install --dangerous uitk-gallery_0.2_amd64.snap
uitk-gallery and uninstalled by: 
snap remove uitk-gallery Now that you have seen how to package the UITK gallery from source into a snap, you can do the same for your own QML application by using the dump plugin with the dependencies as stage-packages. If your application includes C++ code as well, you need to use another plugin, for example the qmake plugin. For that we refer to the Snapcraft tutorials mentioned in the introduction. For those who like to experiment with newer versions of upstream Qt, we provide qt57 and qt58 cloud parts in the parts repository for Qt 5.7.1 and 5.8 (in development). However, the qt57 and qt58 cloud parts do not yet include a wrapper script similar to desktop-launch, so one must be included with with snap configuration, see for example timostestapp2. When using these cloud parts, you should usually omit any Qt/QML package from stage-packages, as the ones compiled from newer Qt are used directly, and you should also omit the after: [desktop-qt5]. Ubuntu app platform snap The snap files we created in the previous sections contain everything that is needed in order to run the UITK gallery application, resulting in a snap file of 86MB. Here we will explain how to use the Ubuntu app platform snap when you have multiple app snaps that all use the same Qt version. Benefits of this approach include disk space saving, download time and bandwidth usage if metered. When your snap uses the ubuntu-app-platform snap for Qt and other platform libraries, we can remove the stage-packages from the snapcraft.yaml file because (in this case), all the needed libraries are included in ubuntu-app-platform. We must also replace after: [desktop-qt5] by after: [desktop-ubuntu-app-platform]. This will set-up your snap to use the global desktop theme, icon theme, gsettings integration, etc. A more elaborate description of the desktop-ubuntu-app-platform is given in the parts list on the Ubuntu wiki. In the uitk-gallery directory we must currently create a directory where the files from the platform snap can be mounted using the content interface: 
mkdir ubuntu-app-platform and this empty directory (mount point) must be added in the YAML file as well. At this point the directory structure is as follows: 
uitk-gallery/
 .. snapcraft.yaml
 .. ubuntu-ui-toolkit-gallery/
    .. [gallery contents]
 .. ubuntu-app-platform/
 The whole YAML is: 
name: uitk-gallery
version: '0.3'
summary: Showcase gallery that demonstrates the components in the Ubuntu UI Toolkit.

  See https://developer.ubuntu.com/api/qml/ for the API documentation of the components. ubuntu-app-platform snap must be installed for this snap to work.

grade: devel
confinement: strict

plugs:
    platform: # plug name, to be used later
        interface: content
        content: ubuntu-app-platform1 # content being mounted and the version, currently 1
        target: ubuntu-app-platform # the mount directory created
        default-provider: ubuntu-app-platform # default content source snap, currently the only provider too

parts:
  ubuntu-ui-toolkit-gallery:
    plugin: dump
    source: .
    after: [desktop-ubuntu-app-platform]
    snap: [ubuntu-ui-toolkit-gallery, ubuntu-app-platform]

apps:
  uitk-gallery:
    command: desktop-launch "qmlscene $SNAP/ubuntu-ui-toolkit-gallery/ubuntu-ui-toolkit-gallery.qml"
    plugs: [platform, unity7, opengl]
 Again, the new snap file can be created using: 
snapcraft This time, before we can use the snap, the ubuntu-app-platform snap must be installed and connected to the new uitk-gallery snap. So, execute the following commands: 
snap install ubuntu-app-platform
snap install --dangerous uitk-gallery_0.3_amd64.snap
snap connect uitk-gallery:platform ubuntu-app-platform:platform
uitk-gallery
 Note that the snaps must be connected before running uitk-gallery for the first time. If uitk-gallery has been executed before the snap connect you will see an error message. To fix the problem, uninstall the uitk-gallery snap, then re-install it and run the snap connect command before executing uitk-gallery. This is a known limitation in snapd which will be resolved soon. Another note: once support for the default-provider, already defined above, will correctly be implemented in snap, there will no longer be a need to install the platform snap separately - it will be pulled from the store automatically and the interface connects automatically. Evaluation We demonstrated three different approaches to creating a UITK gallery snap, which we gave the version numbers 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3. For each of the approaches, the table below lists the time needed for the different stages of a snapcraft run, but the pull and build stages have been combined because when doing pull, some of the prerequisites need to be built already. The all stages row shows the total time when running the snapcraft command in a clean directory, so that all stages are executed sequentially, so the value is less than the sum of the previous rows in the table because in each stage it is not necessary to check completion of the previous stages. Version (bzr revision) 0.1 (r1) 0.2 (r2) 0.3 (r3) build (includes pull) 1m49s 1m48s 3.6s stage 7s 7s 1.5s prime 33s 34s 1.8s snap 1m11s 1m13s 1.7s all stages 3m32s 3m20s 4.0s install 2.2s 2.4s 1.2s snap file size 86 MB 86 MB 1.3 MB The measurements were done on a laptop with an Intel Core i5-6200U CPU with 8 GB RAM and an solid-state drive by running each command three times and listing the average execution time. All build-dependencies were pre-installed so their installation time is not included in the measurements. Note that this table only serves as an illustration, and execution times will vary greatly depending on your system configuration and internet connection, but it can easily be tested on your own hardware by bzr branching revisions r1, r2 and r3 of lp:~tpeeters/+junk/blog-snapping-qt-apps. The times and file size listed in the last column (version 0.3) do not include downloading and installing the ubuntu-app-platform snap, which is 135 MB (it includes more than just the minimal Qt and UITK dependencies of the UITK gallery). It can be seen that (depending on the internet connection speed, and which files were downloaded already), using the ubuntu-app-platform can speed up the pull and build time when creating a new snap file. However, the most important advantage is the reduction of the sum of the file sizes when installing multiple app snaps that all depend on Qt or other libraries that are part of the platform snap, because the libraries need to be installed only once. The disadvantage of this approach is that the app snap must be built using the exact same Qt (and other libraries) version as the ubuntu-app-platform snap, so the choice whether the snap should be fully self-contained or depend on the platform snap must be made individually for each use case. Future work The UITK gallery snap is not yet available in the Ubuntu store, so our next step will be to publish a UITK examples snap that includes the UITK gallery, and to set-up automatic publishing of that snap to different channels when we update the UITK or the examples. We will also evaluate what is the best way to make newer versions of Qt available and determine whether we need to provide prebuilt binaries to replace the qt57 and qt58 cloud parts. Finally, we will determine which libraries need to be included in the ubuntu-app-platform snap. The plan is to include all APIs that are listed on https://developer.ubuntu.com/api/qml/ and if APIs are missing we will add them to that webpage as well as to the platform snap. Of course, if you think we are forgetting a library that is useful and used in many different applications, please leave a comment below.

Things to do in the Lehigh Valley this weekend Severe weather alert in Philadelphia, Delaware, Berks, Northampton, Monroe, Lehigh and Carbon counties. November 20 News Nation/World Pennsylvania News Donald Trump nominee's comments 'troubling,' lawyers for exiled Muslim cleric say Muslim cleric Gulen speaks: Erdogan would accept no message from me U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whose followers Turkey blames for a failed coup, said President Erdogan would not accept any message from him. U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whose followers Turkey blames for a failed coup, said President Erdogan would not accept any message from him. Michael RubinkamOf The Associated Press Lawyers for a Pennsylvania-based Muslim cleric accused by Turkey of masterminding a failed coup said Friday they're confident he won't be extradited, even though President-elect Donald Trump's choice for national security adviser recently denounced him as a "masked source of terror" and argued the U.S. shouldn't allow him to stay. Michael Flynn, a former Army lieutenant general tapped Friday by Trump, was highly critical of Fethullah Gulen in an Election Day op-ed for the Washington, D.C.-based newspaper The Hill. "Gulen's vast global network has all the right markings to fit the description of a dangerous sleeper terror network. From Turkey's point of view, Washington is harboring Turkey's Osama bin Laden," Flynn wrote. "We should not provide him safe haven." Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan contends Gulen orchestrated an attempted military coup in July and has demanded his extradition. President Barack Obama's administration has not complied. Gulen has never been charged with a crime in the U.S., and he has consistently denounced terrorism as well as the failed coup in Turkey. One of Gulen's lawyers, Jason Weinstein, called Flynn's comments about Gulen "troubling" but said the extradition process is a legal matter in the hands of the Department of Justice. Who is Fethullah Gulen, the cleric being blamed for Turkey coup attempt? The Associated Press A lawyer for the Turkish government, Robert Amsterdam, said that "there are indications of direct involvement" in the coup attempt by Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim cleric who is living in exile in Pennsylvania. He said he and his firm "have attempted repeatedly to warn the U.S. government of the threat... A lawyer for the Turkish government, Robert Amsterdam, said that "there are indications of direct involvement" in the coup attempt by Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim cleric who is living in exile in Pennsylvania. He said he and his firm "have attempted repeatedly to warn the U.S. government of the threat... (The Associated Press) "We hope and expect that the law will be followed here and that politics will not interfere with the judgment of career officials at DOJ. If the law is followed, then we are confident that Mr. Gulen will not be returned to Turkey, where he is certain to be subject to torture, a sham trial, and execution," Weinstein said in a statement. According to Senate records, Flynn's company, Flynn Intel Group, registered as a lobbyist on Sept. 15 for a Dutch-based company headed by a Turkish businessman, Ekim Alptekin. The Senate disclosure says Flynn "will advise client on U.S. domestic and foreign policy." Poconos-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen addresses a foreign policy council in a pre-recorded video PHILADELPHIA — An Islamic cleric whom Turkey accuses of masterminding July's abortive coup has again condemned a Turkish government crackdown on his supporters, saying Thursday that his "heart is aching."

PHILADELPHIA — An Islamic cleric whom Turkey accuses of masterminding July's abortive coup has again condemned a Turkish government crackdown on his supporters, saying Thursday that his "heart is aching." In videotaped remarks to the World Affairs Council of Philadelphia, Fethullah Gulen said the...Read the story Alptekin told The Associated Press on Friday that while he believes Gulen leads a "criminal organization," he has no connection to Erdogan's government and had nothing to do with Flynn's article. "It is simply preposterous," said Alptekin, who also chairs the Turkish-American Business Council. "I would never dare suggest anything like that, and if I had, my relationship (with Flynn) would have been immediately over." He said his business consultancy, Inovo B.V., hired Flynn Intel to advise it on security issues in the Middle East. Robert Kelley, the chief counsel to Flynn Intel Group, didn't immediately return an email from The Associated Press seeking comment. Flynn said in a statement previously that if he returns to "government service, my relationship with my company will be severed, in accordance with the policy announced by President-elect Trump." In the op-ed, Flynn asserted that Gulen's moderate image masks a hidden "radical Islamist" agenda. He did not provide evidence. Gulen has criticized Erdogan, his onetime ally, over the Turkish leader's authoritarian rule. The Erdogan regime has launched a broad campaign against Gulen's movement in Turkey and abroad, purging civil servants suspected of ties to the movement, seizing businesses and closing media organizations. In the United States, a lawyer hired by the Turkish government has lodged numerous accusations against a network of about 150 publicly funded charter schools started by followers of Gulen, whose philosophy blends a mystical form of Islam with advocacy of democracy, education, science and interfaith dialogue. Nobody associated with the U.S. schools has been charged with wrongdoing. Gulen has lived on a compound in the Pocono Mountains since 1999.

PC Gamer News Reviews Hardware Pro Best Of More Magazine Meet the team Newsletter Signup Community Guidelines Affiliate Links Search Asus ROG GX800 laptop trades mobility for liquid-cooled GTX 1080 SLI By Paul Lilly Hide the Ultrabook. Shares You might have thought that when Asus debuted its water-cooled GX700 laptop last year that it would be a one-and-done design, but you'd be wrong. Asus is at it again, this time with the ROG GX800, a similar looking system that's even bigger and more powerful. Instead of a 17-inch panel, Asus supersized the ROG GX800 with an 18.4-inch display. It still boasts a 4K (3840x2160) resolution, as anything less could be deemed silly on such a sensible system (just a bit of slight sarcasm there), along with 100 percent coverage of the RGB color space. Oh, and it supports G-Sync, too. Underneath the massive hood is an Intel Core i7-6820HK processor that's begging to be overclocked and not one, but two GeForce GTX 1080 GPUs in SLI. Yeah, it's like that. This is a no-compromise laptop. Well, except for the obvious—portability. It's big (458x338x454mm) and heavy (5.7kg) all on its own, but add the Hydro Overclocking System, which tacks on another 4.7kg, and you're looking at staying stationary for a spell. The cooling system is the most unique thing about the GX800. It's essentially a liquid cooling dock that allows you to overclock the CPU, GPU, and RAM without fear of the thing cooking itself. "With the Hydro Overclocking System, ROG GX800’s Intel K-SKU CPU can be overclocked to 4.2GHz so you get mind-blowing levels of performance. The graphics cards can be overclocked to 1961MHz, while VRAM and DRAM can be pushed up to 5,200MHz and 2,800MHz respectively," Asus claims. Configurations will come with up to 64GB of DDR4-2800 RAM. It also supports up to three M.2 PCIe-based SSDs in RAID 0 and has built in 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1, two USB 3.1 Type C ports, three USB 3.0 ports, separate microphone and headphone jacks, a GbE LAN port, HDMI and mini DisplayPort output, and a memory card reader. Asus didn't say when the GX800 will be available or for how much, though with the GX700 selling for around $4,700, we suspect this one will top the $5,000 mark.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Surface Book receives November Firmware updates 1 by Michael Allison  @Mkeallison Nov 18, 2016 at 21:59 GMT2 days ago Microsoft has updated the Surface Book and the Surface Book with Performance base with firmware updates earlier today. While the updates initially didn’;t include what was changed, Microsoft has now updated the update history pages to now include what’s new. Microsoft is updating the Intel precision touch driver, this controls how the device deals with touch, this update improves the capability of the device with dealing with “fast touch events” when the device is closed and in a bag. This will probably improve battery life due to the device not responding to touch and potentially turning on while in a bag this draining the battery. The other updates to the Surface Book (and Surface Book with Performance Base) are for stability. Microsoft is updating the Nvidia GeForce GPU as well as the Surface UEFI drivers to improve system stability. Here’s what’s new: Intel Corporation driver update for Intel(R) : Precise Touch Device v1.2.0.70 – reduces false touch events when the device is closed. NVIDIA driver update for NVIDIA GeForce GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GPU v21.21.13.6961 – improves system stability. Microsoft driver update for Surface UEFI: Surface UEFI v90.1380.768.0 – improves system stability. Like with all Windows 10 Updates, Microsoft will download it to your device and install when opportune. However, you can get the update by heading to Windows Update in Settings and Checking for updates directly.

FRENCH PRESS AGENCY - AFP LOS ANGELES Published Share Facebook Twitter Linkedin Google+ Permalink Share via e-mail TO ADD A MESSAGE 
 YOUR E-MAIL VERIFICATION CODE Just like credit cards, smartphones or search engines, autonomous cars will carry a trove of information about their owners as they make driving more comfortable, raising new concerns about privacy. Automakers are engaged in a fierce race to develop the first driverless car, which experts say should hit the road by 2020. Apart from legal obstacles facing the industry as the technology evolves - such as who is responsible in the event of an accident - a digital battle is being waged over the huge amount of technical data that will be stored in such vehicles. "Data is the new oil," Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich said this week during a speech at the Los Angeles auto show, AutoMobility LA. "If you have rich data, your car will be able to deal with complex route situations," Krzanich said. "If not, the car will stop." Sensors, radars and cameras on autonomous vehicles will be able to exchange data with other cars but also, perhaps, with "intelligent" roadways that can help set speed limits depending on weather and traffic conditions. The passenger behind the wheel, meanwhile, can send emails and text messages, listen to music, stream movies, hold a conference call or make a restaurant reservation. Even homes will be connected to vehicles. South Korean automaker Hyundai revealed at the auto show a partnership with Amazon's Alexa voice service to allow customers to start their car, charge their battery or turn on the air conditioner via a quick voice request. Experts say the data stored in these vehicles represents a gold mine for companies. "Where are you, where you stop, how often, what's in there can be used to provide you a rich user experience," Krzanich said. "What music you like, craft choices... that's an opportunity as well." He said Intel was investing $250 million into self-driving technology over the next two years. Karl Brauer, senior director of industry insights at Kelley Blue Book, said all the data collected will be used by car makers and other companies to maximize profit. "If they know you like to go to Starbucks [they will say] 'Oh, he always stops at Starbucks,'" Brauer said. Krzanich acknowledged that the technology posed great challenges in terms of privacy protection and secure sharing. One question on many people's mind is whether, in a world that could be edging closer to the Big Brother oversight of George Orwell's dystopian novel "1984," it will be possible to disconnect at some point. "Consumer privacy is an open question," said Jeremy Carlston, a senior analyst with IHS Automotive.

Michael Flynn, a former Army lieutenant general tapped Friday by Trump, was highly critical of Fethullah Gulen in an Election Day op-ed for the Washington, D.C.-based newspaper The Hill. "Gulen's vast global network has all the right markings to fit the description of a dangerous sleeper terror network. From Turkey's point of view, Washington is harboring Turkey's Osama bin Laden," Flynn wrote. "We should not provide him safe haven." Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan contends Gulen orchestrated an attempted military coup in July and has demanded his extradition. President Barack Obama's administration has not complied. Gulen has never been charged with a crime in the U.S., and he has consistently denounced terrorism as well as the failed coup in Turkey. One of Gulen's lawyers, Jason Weinstein, called Flynn's comments about Gulen "troubling" but said the extradition process is a legal matter in the hands of the Department of Justice. "We hope and expect that the law will be followed here and that politics will not interfere with the judgment of career officials at DOJ. If the law is followed, then we are confident that Mr. Gulen will not be returned to Turkey, where he is certain to be subject to torture, a sham trial, and execution," Weinstein said in a statement. According to Senate records, Flynn's company, Flynn Intel Group, registered as a lobbyist on Sept. 15 for a Dutch-based company headed by a Turkish businessman, Ekim Alptekin. The Senate disclosure says Flynn "will advise client on U.S. domestic and foreign policy." Alptekin told The Associated Press on Friday that while he believes Gulen leads a "criminal organization," he has no connection to Erdogan's government and had nothing to do with Flynn's article. "It is simply preposterous," said Alptekin, who also chairs the Turkish-American Business Council. "I would never dare suggest anything like that, and if I had, my relationship (with Flynn) would have been immediately over." He said his business consultancy, Inovo B.V., hired Flynn Intel to advise it on security issues in the Middle East. Robert Kelley, the chief counsel to Flynn Intel Group, didn't immediately return an email from The Associated Press seeking comment. Flynn said in a statement previously that if he returns to "government service, my relationship with my company will be severed, in accordance with the policy announced by President-elect Trump." In the op-ed, Flynn asserted that Gulen's moderate image masks a hidden "radical Islamist" agenda. He did not provide evidence. Gulen has criticized Erdogan, his onetime ally, over the Turkish leader's authoritarian rule. The Erdogan regime has launched a broad campaign against Gulen's movement in Turkey and abroad, purging civil servants suspected of ties to the movement, seizing businesses and closing media organizations. In the United States, a lawyer hired by the Turkish government has lodged numerous accusations against a network of about 150 publicly funded charter schools started by followers of Gulen, whose philosophy blends a mystical form of Islam with advocacy of democracy, education, science and interfaith dialogue. Nobody associated with the U.S. schools has been charged with wrongdoing. Gulen has lived on a compound in the Pocono Mountains since 1999.

James R. Clapper, director of national intelligence and Marcel Lettre, undersecretary of defense for intelligence, also appeared before the committee. Work called the relationships and cooperation between DoD and the intelligence community “absolutely crucial as we seek to allocate our intelligence sources to meet the challenges around the world.” DoD’s Challenges, Intel Demands The deputy secretary noted DoD’s challenges range from fighting the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and other extremist groups, to monitoring North Korea’s active ballistic missile and nuclear weapons program, ensuring Iran does not develop further nuclear capability, keeping a watchful eye on Russia’s actions in the Ukraine, Eastern Europe and elsewhere, and scrutinizing China’s activities in the South and East China seas. “The demands on the intelligence community are formidable,” Work told committee members. “The intelligence community is working as best as they can, and we would consider their job to be outstanding [in trying to] apply scarce intelligence resources across all of these challenges.” Clapper: Nation Faces ‘Most Diverse Threats’ “As I said before this committee many times, our nation is facing the most diverse array of threats that I've seen in my 53-plus years in the intelligence business,” Clapper testified. “And that's what makes the topic of this hearing so important.” Never before have the intelligence community and the Department of Defense needed to work so closely, the director said. “We have a shared responsibility to keep our nation safe and secure,” he added Shared Missions, Risks The director said the close-working relationship between DoD and the intelligence community is in “stark contrast” to his service during the Vietnam War, when civilian employees in a war zone were rarely seen. “Today, civilians and service members are serving shoulder-to-shoulder, focusing on the same mission, sharing the same risks and enduring the same challenging circumstances,” Clapper said.

Retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn served as an adviser to Trump on national security and foreign policy throughout the presidential campaign. Flynn has said he agreed with Trump’s initial proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States, but told Al Jazeera earlier this year it likely “wouldn’t work,” and that he supports the vetting of Muslims coming from Syria and places where terrorism is a major threat. He also accompanied Trump to his first top-secret national security briefing in August this year, and he was vetted as a potential running mate before Vice President-elect Mike Pence was eventually announced, two senior level sources with direct knowledge told ABC News earlier this year. “I am pleased that Lieutenant General Michael Flynn will be by my side as we work to defeat radical Islamic terrorism, navigate geopolitical challenges and keep Americans safe at home and abroad,” Trump said in a statement today. “General Flynn is one of the country’s foremost experts on military and intelligence matters and he will be an invaluable asset to me and my administration.” The position of National Security Adviser does not require U.S. Senate approval.  Here are some of his controversial comments: Flynn on ‘Radical Islam’ Flynn, a registered Democrat who had a decades-long military career, served under the Obama administration until reportedly being forced to retire early as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014. The early retirement resulted from “the stand I took on radical Islam,” he wrote in an op-ed for the New York Post. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby reportedly said at the time that the retirements had “been planned for some time” and that then-Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel “appreciates the service of these two dedicated and professional leaders.” For Flynn’s part, he told Fox News in April 2015, “I’ve been at war with Islam, or a component of Islam, for the last decade.” Flynn earlier this year released a book — “The Field of Fight: How We Can Win The Global War Against Radical Islam And Its Allies” — that he co-wrote sharing his views on what he called the “global war against radical Islam,” calling for the United States to develop a deeper understanding of radical ideology. Flynn wrote, “we’re in a world war against a messianic mass movement of evil people, most of them inspired by a totalitarian ideology: Radical Islam.” He also said in the book, “I don’t believe all cultures are morally equivalent, and I think the West, and especially America, is far more civilized, far more ethical and moral, than the system our main enemies want to impose on us.” “And we’ve got to stop feeling the slightest bit guilty about calling them by name and identifying them as fanatical killers acting on behalf of a failed civilization.”  Flynn, who’s chairman and CEO of Flynn Intel Group, is also a board member of ACT for America, which the Southern Poverty Law Center calls “far and away the largest grassroots anti-Muslim group in America.” The organization bills itself as “the nation’s largest non-profit, non-partisan, grassroots national security organization” that’s “committed to recruiting, training, and mobilizing citizens community by community to help protect and preserve American culture and to keep this nation safe,” according to its website. ACT for America did not respond to ABC News’ request for comment. “Mr. Flynn’s past Islamophobic statements, and his association with the nation’s most venomous anti-Muslim hate group, should disqualify him from serving in any public office,” Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, told ABC News before Flynn’s official selection. In this tweet from February, Flynn said the fear of Muslims is a rational one: Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL: please forward this to others: the truth fears no questions … “ he tweeted, referring to an anti-Muslim video from a third party. “Radical Islam” is a designation that President Obama has refused to recognize. Throughout his tenure as president, he has sought to make a clear distinction between Islam built on peaceful teachings and the acts of terrorism carried out by extremists who adhere to radical interpretations of the religion. Flynn did not respond to ABC News’ request for comment left with Flynn Intel. But he said in a statement this morning via the Trump Transition team that, “I am deeply humbled and honored to accept the position as National Security Adviser to serve both our country and our nation’s next President, Donald J. Trump.” Muslims ‘All on Guard’ Speaking this summer at an ACT for America event in Dallas, Flynn likened Islam to “a cancer, according to the Dallas Morning News,” adding that documents taken from terrorist groups tell followers to “get into the bloodstream of the opposition,” which Flynn said he interprets as attacks on Western nations. Muslim activists are troubled by the prospect of a Trump administration that might include Flynn. “President-elect Trump is carefully curating a senior team that seem to have one thing in common: a deep seated animosity against Islam and Muslims. [Lt.] General Flynn is one of them, and has been on the record about his sentiments towards Islam and Muslims repeatedly,” said Rabia Chaudry, a senior fellow at the United States Institute of Peace and a board member of the new Muslim-Jewish Advisory Council that was launched to combat Islamophobia and anti-Semitism. “Putting this man in charge of domestic security matters has the potential of great damage to American Muslims, who are certain to be at top of his ‘enemy within’ list, rather than white nationals, which both studies and authorities show are the real greatest domestic threat we face,” she said before Flynn’s official selection. Hazem Bata, secretary general of the Islamic Society of North America, says Muslim leaders across the United States “are all on guard.” “Our community is preparing for an America that has parts of government openly hostile to Muslims,” Bata said before Flynn’s official selection. “We are hoping for the best, but getting ready for the worst.” Copyright © 2016, ABC Radio.

Is Apple throttling the 4G speeds of some iPhone 7 models? by Chris Smith 18 November 2016 0 shares Read Comments If you have an iPhone 7 running on the Verizon Wireless network in the United States then your device may not be living up to its fullest 4G potential, reports have claimed. According to Bloomberg sources Apple may be deliberately tempering the speeds of the Verizon iPhone 7 models so they don’t make the AT&T version look bad. Related: iPhone 7 vs Galaxy S7 In theory the Verizon model should be much faster than its rival’s due to the presence of a Qualcomm LTE modem compared with the Intel modem within AT&T's phone, but tests have shown little difference. Now researchers are suggesting Cupertino may be have chosen not to enable certain features of the iPhone’s network chip to keep AT&T’s models on an even playing field. “The data indicates that the iPhone 7 is not taking advantage of all of Verizon’s network capabilities,” said Twin Prime’s Gabriel Tavridis. “I doubt that Apple is throttling each bit on the Verizon iPhone, but it could have chosen to not enable certain features of the network chip.” Apple said there’s no discernible difference between network performance, but did not address whether this was by design. “Every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple’s wireless performance standards, quality metrics, and reliability testing,” said Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller. “In all of our rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards, in thousands of hours of real-world field testing, and in extensive carrier partner testing, the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models." Video: iPhone 7 vs 7 Plus Why would Apple hold back performance when it would surely love to be able to boast 4G speeds? Well it doesn’t want to create the sense that some versions of its phone are superior, according to Jan Dawson or Jackdaw Research. "They don’t want one version to get the reputation that it is better," he said. "If Apple had a guiding principle it’s that they want to make sure customers were having a consistent performance.” As a Verizon subscriber would you be annoyed if this proved true?

That's part of why you choose a network, for coverage, speed, cost, etc. It's not for Apple to interfere with this part of the marketplace and they're depriving another company of a way to differentiate itself within the marketplace. It's a disgraceful business tactic and if I was the company being disadvantaged by this I'd be taking them to court. fried_egg November 19, 2016, 12:53 pm I can't talk for the USA market but I can look at it from the UK market... and networks sell themselves on their performance.. E.G EE with it's up to 24mbps 4G, upto 60mbbs "double speed" & upto 150 (but likely 90) 4G+ services that other 4G networks can't or find hard to match... if the network is "charging" for their premium speed offers, should the hardware maker "slow them down" so as to create a "level" consistent "experience" for their phone users ?

flexibility News provided by Huawei Nov 18, 2016, 12:44 ET Share this article SALT LAKE CITY, Nov. 18, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Huawei launched a new-generation high-performance computing (HPC) platform, the FusionServer X6000, at the Supercomputing Conference 2016 (SC16). This FusionServer X6000 will aid computing-intensive workloads and provide enterprise customers with an ideal choice for an HPC platform that has higher efficiency and greater flexibility. Continue Reading The FusionServer X6000 launch ceremony "Faced with the challenges of digital transformation, enterprises are eager for service reconstruction, which drives the convergence of traditional HPC and cutting-edge technologies such as cloud computing and Big Data," said William Dong, Vice President of Data Center Solution Sales, Huawei Enterprise BG. "With outstanding R&D capabilities and comprehensive product portfolios in the IT domain, Huawei joins hands with industry partners to build joint innovation centers around the globe. We are dedicated to providing our customers IT infrastructures with leading technologies, as well as innovative HPC cloud, HPC, and Big Data solutions to help customers achieve business success."

Based on the high bandwidth and low latency features of 100 Gbps networks, the X6000 HPC platform can achieve a single-node throughput of 4.8 million IOPS. As an important partner of Huawei in the IT domain, Intel was invited to join and witness the launch of Huawei FusionServer X6000. "Huawei's new-generation FusionServer X6000 HPC platform, based on the Intel® Scalable System Framework, provides the balanced performance, scalability, and flexibility to efficiently handle a wide range of HPC workloads," said Hugo Saleh, Director of Marketing and Enabling, Intel Scalable Datacenter Solutions. "The FusionServer X6000 is a great example of how Intel® Xeon® processors and Intel® Omni-path architecture can combine to build industry leading solutions with innovative fabric features that optimize performance, resiliency, and traffic movement." Huawei is showcasing its HPC solutions for industry scenarios at SC16. Among the HPC solutions on show are Huawei's high-density servers FusionServer E9000 and X6800 with 100G high-speed interconnect technology and powerful cluster scalability. These servers can dramatically accelerate industrial CAE simulation. Huawei is also displaying its KunLun supercomputer, which features the company's proprietary Node Controller interconnect chips. KunLun supports up to 32 CPUs and is perfect for cutting-edge research scenarios that require frequent in-memory computing. Additionally Huawei's high-performance storage solutions, OceanStor 9000 and ES3000 SSD, which can effectively improve data transmission bandwidth and latency, are on display. A series of other milestones and achievement's based on Huawei's cooperation with industry partners were also announced (or demonstrated) during SC16: Huawei and ANSYS announced the two parties' partnership in building industrial computer aided engineering (CAE) solutions, and jointly released their Fluent Performance white paper, which details optimal system configurations in fluid simulation scenarios for industry customers. Huawei and A*STAR Computational Resource Centre (A*CRC) jointly presented InfiniCortex during SC16, an international project led by A*CRC Singapore which demonstrates a worldwide high-speed fabric which brings together supercomputing facilities from four continents. Huawei and Bright Computing showcased an HPC cloud cluster management solution, which enables organizations to easily and efficiently consume HPC resources from the cloud. Huawei has increasingly become more prominent in the HPC market. It has successfully deployed HPC clusters for a large number of global vehicle producers, large-scale supercomputing centers, and research institutions. These show that Huawei's HPC platforms are optimized for industry applications which can help customers significantly simplify service processes and improve work efficiency, enabling them to focus on product development and research.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) FILE - In this Oct. 7, 2016 file photo, a sign for Wall Street is carved into a building located near the New York Stock Exchange. Japanese shares rose, Friday, Nov. 18, 2016, on the yen's weakness while other Asian benchmarks wobbled after Fed chair Janet Yellen signaled that policymakers intend to raise interest rates soon. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) New York • U.S. stocks slipped Friday as investors take a pause following some huge moves since last week's presidential election. Drugmakers and other health care companies took the largest early losses. Retailers Gap and Abercrombie & Fitch were dropping after they gave weak quarterly reports, while discount retailer Ross Stores climbed. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average slid 37 points, or 0.2 percent, to 18,867 as of 10:25 a.m. Mountain time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 5 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,181. The Nasdaq composite touched a record high, but turned lower and gave up 13 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,321. VIDEOS TOP JOBS The losses weren't large, but they represented the biggest decline for stocks since Nov. 3. At that time, the market was enduring a nine-day slide. QUEASY FEELING: Losses for drug companies weighed down health care stocks. Botox maker Allergan retreated $3.92, or 2 percent, to $196.07 and biotech giant Amgen fell $2.30, or 1.6 percent, to $145.06. Hepatitis C drugmaker Gilead Sciences shed $1.29, or 1.7 percent, to $74.29 and Merck lost 73 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $61.97. HOME GOODS GO BAD: Companies that sell common household products are also moving lower. Procter & Gamble gave up $1.04, or 1.3 percent, to $82.03 and drugstore operator Walgreens Boots Alliance slumped 98 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $83.01. Those companies tend to pay hefty dividends, and those are less appealing to investors in times of higher inflation. FUN IN THE SUN: Investors approved the combination of electric car maker Tesla Motors and solar power company SolarCity. The deal, first proposed by Tesla CEO Elon Musk in June, has gotten a chilly reception on Wall Street. Analysts wondered why Tesla would want to take on SolarCity while it's building a big battery factory in Nevada and also preparing to launch its first mass-market car, the Model 3, due out at the end of 2017. Shares of both companies dropped in the ensuing months. Tesla slumped $1.55 to $187.11 and SolarCity rose 19 cents to $20.59. RETAIL: Teen clothing company Abercrombie & Fitch fell $2.42, or 14.3 percent, to $14.51 after it reported weak sales and a smaller profit than analysts had expected. Gap's said fewer people visited its stores heading into the holiday season. Its stock gave up $4.93, or 16.1 percent, to $25.78. Sporting goods Hibbett Sports retailer cut its annual forecasts after a weak third-quarter report. It dropped $5.40, or 11.9 percent, to $39.90. Shoppers are not buying as many clothes and moving toward discount chains. That trend continued as discount retailer Ross Stores rose $2.89, or 4.4 percent, to $68.42 after it posted a better-than-expected profit and sales. DOLLAR SEEING GREEN: Already at its highest mark since early 2003, the dollar continued to climb. It's around annual highs against the euro and six-month highs against the yen. The dollar rose to 110.51 yen from 109.89 yen. The euro fell to $1.0592 from $1.0626. BONDS: Investors continued to sell U.S. government bonds at a rapid clip, and bond prices wobbled and turned lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.33 percent from 2.30 percent. Bond prices have fallen hard since the election and yields are now at their highest in a year. OUT IN FORCE: Customer management software maker Salesforce.com jumped after a solid quarterly report and strong guidance. Its stock picked up $2.49, or 3.3 percent, to $77.68. A MARVEL: Chipmaker Marvell Technology disclosed much stronger sales than analysts expected and gave a surprising forecast for the current quarter. Its stock gained $1.19, or 8.9 percent, to $14.55. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude gave up 30 cents at $45.12 a barrel in New York, while Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, slid 25 cents to $46.24 a barrel in London. OVERSEAS: France's CAC 40 fell 0.5 percent and the FTSE 100 in Britain dipped 0.3 percent. The German DAX lost 0.2 percent. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index added 0.6 percent as the yen hit a six-month low, helping shares of the country's big exporters. South Korea's Kospi shed 0.3 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.4 percent.   Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY VIEW PHOTO GALLERY JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Op-ed: Should Mormons who voted for Trump get temple recommends?

RadeonSI Benchmarks On Budgie, GNOME Shell, KDE Plasma 5, LXDE, MATE, Unity, Xfce Written by Michael Larabel in Linux Gaming on 17 November 2016. Page 1 of 3. 44 Comments Last month when Ubuntu 16.10 was released I ran some desktop gaming benchmarks with Intel Skylake graphics under Unity, GNOME, Xfce, LXDE, KDE, Openbox, and MATE. Following that article a few Phoronix Premium readers requested similar tests be done under the RadeonSI Gallium3D driver stack, so here are those numbers. For Friday benchmarking fun, here are numbers from Budgie, GNOME Shell, KDE Plasma 5, LXDE, MATE, Unity 7, and Xfce. All packages were obtained from the Ubuntu 16.10 Yakkety Yak repository. With the test requests coming in from premium supporters, tests on KDE Plasma 5 were done with the out-of-the-box settings (compositing enabled) and then again when disabled via Alt + Shift + F12. This RadeonSI Ubuntu 16.10 desktop comparison was done with a Radeon R9 Fury graphics card and the graphics driver stack consisted of the Linux 4.9 Git kernel and Mesa 13.1-devel Git as of this week from the Padoka PPA built against LLVM 4.0 SVN. These results aren't as interesting as the Intel desktop comparison numbers, but nevertheless the results are on the following pages. All of these OpenGL Linux game tests were carried out using the open-source Phoronix Test Suite benchmarking software.

This machine was built for 4K gaming on the go, and to run flat-out required a large 'hump' or 'wart' with integrated hybrid liquid cooling system to be attached. At Computex this summer we saw an update to the GX700 first touted alongside the unveiling of Project Avalon at the 'Join the republic' press event. Now Asus ROG has officially announced the new GX800. Like the GX700 before it, the Asus ROG GX800 uses the Intel Skylake Core i7-6820HK processor. This is a 45W TDP 4C/8T processor that normally runs at base/boost of 2.7/3.6GHz. The Asus Hydro Overclocking System wart boosts the processor clock to 4.2GHz automatically. DDR4 memory in the machine can be clocked as high as 2,800 MHz. Graphics processing gets a massive update: the GX800 replaces last year's GeForce GTX 980 GPU in the GX700 with a pair of GTX 1080s. Asus says that the GPUs are overclocked to 1,961MHz, with video memory pushed to 5,200MHz. The machine running with the clocks mentioned above achieves a score of 10,395 in 3DMark Fire Strike Ultra. Asus ROG aimed to minimise any compromise with this gaming laptop, so beyond its raw processing power Asus has implemented other choice PC technologies. For example, the GX800 is fitted with a 18-inch Ultra-HD (3840x2160) 100 per cent Adobe RGB display with G-SYNC. It includes a MechTAG keyboard with mechanical switches (2.5mm of key travel, 100 per cent anti-ghosting with 30-key rollover) and AURA RGB backlight effects for individual keys. Storage is catered for by three M.2 NVMe SSDs in RAID 0 configuration. Other niceties include; a Thunderbolt 3 interface, 802.22ac Wi-Fi plus external antenna, and a high-end ESS SABRE headphone DAC and amplifier. Asus ROG bundles the new GX800 with ROG backback and suitcase for the laptop, cooling 'wart', and twin 330W power adaptors. Quality luggage will be attractive to future owners, as the GX800 weighs 5.7Kg alone, and the Hydro Overclocking System is 4.7kg. Asus ROG hasn't published pricing and availability details, however it did say the GX800 was "coming soon" back in mid-June.

They could have used a ‘tube’ with air blowing from one side to the other with a coil with fins taking the water down the tube.. At that size I may as well just get/take a small form factor pc and a screen…. Posted by bitbucket - Fri 18 Nov 2016 11:48 Am I understanding correctly? 10.4kg, for the whole thing… I mean, at that weight it's almost as convenient to stick your PC in a suitcase and cart that around instead - monitor and all. I predict they'll sell absolutely none of these. Zero. And anyone who does buy it has more money than sense.

Skip to content Hackaday Primary Menu Home Blog Hackaday.io Store Hackaday Prize Submit About November 20, 2016 iPhone NVMe Chip Reversed with Custom Breakout Boards 34 Comments by: Brian Benchoff November 18, 2016 Ever so slowly, the main storage in our computers has been moving from spinning disks, to SSDs over SATA, to Flash drives connected to a PCI something or other. The lastest technology is NVMe — Non-Volitile Memory Express — a horribly named technology that puts a memory controller right on the chip. Intel has a PCI-based NVMe drive out, Samsung recently released an M.2 NVMe drive, and the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus are built around this storage technology. New chips demand a reverse engineering session, and that’s exactly what [Ramtin Amin] did. He took a few of these chips out of an iPhone, created a board that will read them, and managed to analize the firmware. Any reverse engineering will begin with desoldering the chip. This is easy enough, with the real trick being getting it working again outside whatever system it was removed from. For this, [Ramtin] built his own PCIe card with a ZIF socket. This socket was custom-made, but the good news is you can buy one from ITEAD. Yes, it is expensive — that’s what you get with a custom-made ZIF socket. With the chip extracted, a custom PCIe card, and a bit of work with the NVMe implementation for Linux, [Ramtin] had just about everything working. Eventually, he was able to dump the entire file system on the chip, allowing anyone to theoretically back up the data on their iPhone or MacBook Air. Of course, and especially for the iPhone, this data is encrypted. It’s not possible to clone an iPhone using this method, but it is a remarkably deep dive into the hardware that makes our storage tick.” Posted in hardware, sliderTagged flash, iphone, NVMe, PCIe, reverse engineering, storage Post navigation ← Vintage Tube Radio Restorations Think Your Way to Work in a Mind-Controlled Tesla → 34 thoughts on “iPhone NVMe Chip Reversed with Custom Breakout Boards” Ryan White says: November 18, 2016 at 1:37 am “Analize” – word of the day/year :) Report comment Reply werecatf says: November 18, 2016 at 2:29 am Freudian slip, clearly shows exactly what Brian Benchoff has been thinking of lately!

First release was 2011. Read all about it on wikipedia. This article makes it sound like it’s brand new technology which it isn’t but it’s mostly been in use in high end PCs and servers so maybe not everyone’s heard of it. Report comment Reply james_lan says: November 18, 2016 at 8:22 am When has that ever stopped Apple from re-branding something? It’s actually been in use for far more than that. Pretty much any x86 tablet has been using that for a while, as well as a lot of small computers. M.2 is a rather common form factor for a while.

Hopefully next project to see here is a UFS 2.0 breakout board :) Report comment Reply Sjaak says: November 18, 2016 at 4:49 am Can some tell more about where to buy custom ZIF sockets?

Report comment Reply rasz_pl says: November 18, 2016 at 7:22 am my thought exactly! what confuses me in this writeup is mention of 25 MHz PCIe clock. PCs run at 100 MHz and afaik you cant change it, so how did he make it work? Report comment Reply charliex says: November 18, 2016 at 10:23 pm usually you just div 4 the 100mhz signal Report comment Reply rasz_pl says: November 19, 2016 at 8:28 am wait, does that mean those Apple chips run with x100 PLL multiplier? that would make sense Report comment Reply johnny2dicks says: November 20, 2016 at 9:28 am Probably not. Apple is viciously against any sort of extended use or reuse of any of their devices. They want you to buy something, use it for 2 years tops, TOPS, and then have no other choice but to buy whatever new garbage their slinging. They don’t even want you to reuse complimentary headphones or chargers. Apple executives have a pretty substantial appetite for high class hookers and cocaine, they would spit on an AIDS baby’s face if they caught one trying to teeth on an old iphone 4. They think you and the rest of their customers are stupid, and will throw money every time they whip out their dicks and helicopter it on a stage. And they aren’t entirely wrong.

Sure wish we had a backup for that!

Me and you? Nope, not likely. Report comment Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

The problem that i can't find a solution is that in windows 10 it shows up as a removable device with an eject option (which actually ejects the hd). In my z77 bios settings there is no option to disable hot plug from the marvell connected drives. In windows device manager under Storage controllers Marvell 91xx sata 6g there is no policy setting to disable hot plug neither on the hd connected. Please if anyone has a solution i would really appreciate it..     kens30 View Public Profile Find all posts by kens30     (#2) mbk1969 Ancient Guru   Videocard: GeForce GTX 970 Processor: I7-4930 Mainboard: Asus p9x79 Memory: G Skill RipjawZ, 16GB Soundcard: Onboard + FiiO E17 PSU: 1000 W 11-18-2016, 10:19 | posts: 2,771 | Location: Moscow, Russia Have you flashed latest BIOS or may be special BIOS patches for Marvel controller?

Trying to think hard is harder than you'd think. But when I get it right the electrical activity in my brain rises and the little remote control robot in front of me starts moving forward. It's like magic. It's not though. It's the very real science of Auckland company Thought-Wired. It's mind-controlled head-set technology that could change the world for the physically disabled and for the rest of us. This is a starting point for a new technology that is expected to leap ahead exponentially in the next few years. The fundamental technology is in place, we can move things with our mind. Exponential technology has been the "buzz" phrase at the SingularityU Summit in Christchurch this week. The summit, held in New Zealand for the first time and attended by nearly 1500 people, is one of several held around the world each year by the Silicon Valley think-tank Singularity University. So what does exponential technology mean? "It takes 20 years for a new technology to become an overnight success," says Kathryn Myronuk, a San Francisco based tech consultant futurist and SingularityU keynote speaker. In other words the pace at which new technology moves out of the realms of experimental science can be very slow. But the pace accelerates. Continued below. Related Content The Economy Hub: Why the war on deflation is futile What will replace the fridge? Video Singularity 2016 It's being driven by Moore's Law - the idea coined by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore in the 1960s - that computing power doubles every two years. There is debate about whether we are starting to reach the limits of that law. Regardless it has held true for far too long for us to avoid the impact of a suite of new technologies - from self-driving vehicles, drones virtual reality and 3D printing to cloud based finance business models like Uber - changing the way we live dramatically in the next decade. It may take 20 years for the technology to become functional for everyday use but once it gets to that point it takes just a year or two for it to completely change the world and "disrupt" whatever industries it can be applied to. Humans are not good at seeing the change that is coming, says Myronuk. "People only worry when they see the hardware in front of them." Take a technology like voice recognition. It has been promising big things but continually disappointing users since the first versions were launched in the 1990s, she says. But now something like Skype translate has reached a point where it as able to functionally (if not perfectly) recognise speech and translate a multi-language conversation in real time. Or how about a computer's capacity for visual recognition? We were impressed when sensors were able to recognise basic shapes like a cat and a dog - but so can a two-year-old. Then they started to recognise letters and numbers, which is useful but still not much better than a five-year-old. But now, says Myronuk, computers can look at a medical scan and recognise pre-cancerous tissues. "Suddenly have the abilities of a 40-year-old oncologist and that's the thing that surprises us." The human eye, says her Singularity U colleague and health industry special, Michael Gillam, sees at a detail of about 600 million pixels. In terms of creating the visual equivalent of a hearing aid we currently have computer based recognition at about 1600 pixels. It has been slow progress but if the current exponential path of development holds we should reach human eye quality by 2037. What's more amazing is how far beyond that the technology could go in just another two years. These are great stories and at a conference like SingularityU , packed with inspiring speakers, they provide a welcome antidote to lot of the politics and pessimism that have dominated news this year. But there's no getting around the fact that the rise of smart technology in all its forms presents a huge challenge for the human race. What will we do to earn a living? What should our children be studying? And even if we can manage the transition how can we do it without alienating large sections of the population, exacerbating economic inequality and creating worrying reactionary political movement sand conflict. In 2013 Oxford University researchers Carl Frey and Michael Osborne concluded that 47 per cent of jobs could be reproduced by machines. But a more recent McKinsey study, focused on tasks rather than professions, found that some 85 per cent of human tasks could be reproduced by machines. Society hasn't really begun to absorb the level of change that is coming, Myronuk says. She compares it in scale to climate change and has dubbed it economic climate change. On balance she feels we are less prepared for and have less time to deal with the effects of technology. Real climate change is very serious and the debate about our response has reached a point where it goes all the way from classrooms and living rooms through to world leaders and global political forums. However, the response to economic climate change is still only being discussed seriously by a handful of economists and academics. "We're talking about 85 per cent of jobs being automated," Myronuk says. "And we're not talking about one kind of job - it's robots that sew clothes, it's robots that do agriculture it's oncology, discovery of legal documents it's across a wide number of areas. " So how is New Zealand doing at preparing for the change to come. Good but not great, says Amy Fletcher, an associate professor of political science at the University of Canterbury, who specialises in the social policy around this kind of future shock. The World Economic Forum global information technology report ranked New Zealand as the 17th best prepared to harness digital technology. Singapore was number one, followed by Finland and Sweden. "New Zealand is sitting on a firm foundation," says Fletcher. We do have policy advisers on these issues within government. "But we do need more government frameworks for tackling the challenges," she says. Sweden for example has a Minister for the Future and Fletcher says she would like to see a similar ministry in New Zealand. We can't predict the future so we are going to have to experiment with social policy. "We are going to need to be adaptive and our tolerance for risk and failure has to go up." Ideas like a universal basic income, a guaranteed wage for everyone, are starting to gain traction with economists. SingularityU director of strategy Amin Toufani believes it is inevitable. He's confident that the ever decreasing cost of technology will create enough resource abundance to enable the shift. But Myronuk is not convinced this is the answer - at least not in isolation. There is good research to show that when people have money they actually work harder and produce more, she says. "When people have money they use it to move forward and to get out of the poverty trap." But she shares the fears of traditional economists that many countries may simply not have the cash or resources to provide a realistic income. "The reality is we've only done a handful of studies on this," she says. "Imagine if we were talking about climate change and saying don't worry about it, we've done 10 studies." We simply don't yet have the data we need to address the issue and that is the problem, she says. SingularityU director of global grand challenges Nathanial Calhoun has a blunt answer for those wondering what they or their children should study to future-proof themselves. "Your chances of guessing the thing you should be studying now, to have a job in four years are really super, super low. If you are trying to guess eight to 10 years out - forget it." It's sobering advice for parents like me who view these discussions through a prism of protective anxiety for our offspring. But after three days immersed in the world of the SingularityU some clear themes emerge: We do need to take the disruptive threat to society more seriously. We need to teach adaptability and resilience. Toufani says we should be focused on AQ - adaptability quotient. Studies show that IQ is not a great predictor of success, and particularly after the first two years in the work place. What people are going to need is the ability to "learn, unlearn and learn again", he says. "Unlearning should be a core competency". As a society we need to ensure we have a framework in place for workers to change career paths and re-learn. All economics is ultimately about coping with the uncertainty. Our political and social systems, when they work, should be creating the stability and freedom for humans to progress as individuals and as a species. Right now those systems are at serious risk of being outmoded. The technology we are on the verge of unleashing will create a step change in the way we live. The potential to unlock more freedom for human creativity has never been greater but neither has the degree of uncertainty we face. - NZ Herald Read more by Liam Dann Email Liam Dann Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

Reuters/Lucas Jackson The Microsoft Surface Book i7 is the second device in its convertible laptop series and the device features a 13.5-inch tablet as its top half. Pen and Touch support have been provided to its PixelSense screen and the keyboard that is the base of the Surface Book i7 hosts a graphics chip that makes the device better than most other devices in the market currently. The “Dynamic Fulcrum Hinge” is still there despite reports that Microsoft would drop it. In terms of design, it looks very similar to its predecessor. The PixelSense screen has a resolution of 3200x2400 pixels. It uses Intel’s dual-core 6th-gen Skylake Core i7-6600U chipset, SSD from 256GB to 1TB and 8GB and 16GB LPDDR3 options. Tech enthusiasts, fans and experts have all praised the laptop’s incredible speed and long battery life that is better than any other laptop in its class, writes PC World. Some have even stated that the Microsoft Surface Book i7 is somewhat more practical than Apple’s MacBook Pro 2016. The device offers both full-tablet and stylus modes and retains the full-size USB-3 and SD card slots. Thus, the hybrid laptop that doubles as a tablet too is the perfect choice for those who can afford it. This brings the price factor in question. The Microsoft Surface Book i7 is expensive. As per CNET, the Surface Book i7 is an expensive one, starting at US$2,399 (AU$3,150) for 256GB of storage and 8GB of RAM. Upgrading it to 1TB of storage and 16GB RAM will make one shell out US$3,299 (AU$4,330). This perhaps is the biggest downside of Microsoft Surface Book i7. It’s frightfully expensive. Experts have criticised Microsoft for not including the Kaby Lake chipset at that price. However, those who have used the hybrid have all praised its incredible graphics performance. It is clear that Microsoft has put in a lot of time and effort in bettering the laptop’s graphics performance.

President-elect Donald Trump made the vilification of China a key plank of his stormy campaign. Yet its technology giants are already figuring out how they can profit off his victorious White House bid, from the chance to poach disillusioned Silicon Valley workers to possibly cementing business ties with a more pragmatic U.S. For starters, they could swell their ranks of prized tech talent. If the former reality TV star makes good on a pledge to bar foreign workers, some of the tens of thousands of overseas-born workers now plying their trade in the Valley could instead consider a career in the world’s second largest economy, said Robin Li, the billionaire chief executive of Baidu Inc. Li may have voiced the sentiments of his compatriots on Friday. China’s largest technology firms, from Tencent Holdings Ltd. to Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., have blossomed in past years into domestic economic powerhouses, helped by an influx of locally born but foreign-trained talent. Enticing non-Chinese personnel, however, has proven tougher because of language barriers, pervasive web censorship and strict government control of the internet. “I read that an advisor to President-elect Donald Trump complained that three-quarters of engineers in Silicon Valley aren’t Americans,” Li, who heads China’s largest search engine, told the audience at China’s annual World Internet Conference in the historic town of Wuzhen. “So I myself hope that many of these engineers will come to China to work for us.” The corporate luminaries who grace the government-organized assembly typically focus on talking up the potential of domestic markets and policy. It was inevitable however that the topic of Trump’s ascension surfaced at this year’s pow-wow. Li was referring to Trump’s pledge to “end forever” the use of cheaper labor from the H-1B program -- a lottery system that’s a principal source of visas for tech workers. In the two Silicon Valley counties of Santa Clara and San Mateo -- home to Intel Corp. and Nvidia Corp. -- about two-thirds of people working in computing and mathematics fields are foreign-born, according to a study by Joint Venture Silicon Valley using 2014 government data. Many of those are now seriously weighing their options. “Many engineers in Silicon Valley have expressed concern about the United States’ capabilities in innovation,” Li told the conference. “In the past, Chinese IT companies can only attract Chinese engineers from abroad. We would now like to hire more engineers from different backgrounds around the world, because China is the fastest growing major market, so let’s all work together.” Exclusive insights in your inbox, from our technology reporters around the world.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter To be sure, uncertainty surrounds the extent to which Trump will hew to the proposals he floated on the campaign trail. Trump spent months blasting Beijing and threatening a trade war with a country he blames for stealing American jobs and capital. Bankers and lawyers are now said to be counseling Chinese clients to mothball acquisition attempts until Trump clarifies his stance on cross-border deals. “There could be stricter rules in sensitive cutting-edge technologies and the investment review could be tightened,” Wang Chaoyong, chairman of private equity firm ChinaEquity Group, said in an interview. “But in general, as to broader investment, I think it’s business as usual. It will be harmful to the US economy too if they give greater scrutiny to Chinese money.” Others actually anticipate improved relations between the two economic superpowers given the commander-in-chief’s entrepreneurial background. Xiaomi Corp. CEO and co-founder Lei Jun, whose company is best known for low-cost smartphones, has been steadily increasing the number of products it sells to America and doesn’t foresee that ending. “Trump, as an entrepreneur, is pragmatic. And that pragmatic approach will definitely help to develop China-U.S. relations,” he told reporters on the conference’s sidelines. In the end, the rise of China has become simply unstoppable -- Trump or no -- at least from the standpoint of Zhou Hongyi, the CEO of search and cybersecurity firm Qihoo 360 Technology Co. “Chinese companies are leading some of the most advanced internet innovations, and many Chinese companies are investing abroad and to make the Chinese internet model global,” Zhou said. “The new U.S. President won’t stop the trend.” Tencent, for one, is often cited for pioneering app innovation with Wechat, a messaging service used by more than 800 million that’s become the go-to destination for everything from taxi bookings to mobile games. CEO Ma Huateng, while not directly referring to Trump, told the conference his company’s ambition remained international. “This is just a current stage. We’re still trying to go global,” he said. — With assistance by Keith Zhai, and David Ramli Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Key figures in Mr Trump's team have indicated lowering corporation tax by up to 20pc in order to compete with Ireland will be a priority after he takes office in January. However, Mr Noonan, who is on a trade mission in the US, said none of the business leaders he has met have expressed a desire to relocate. The minister has not requested a meeting with the president-elect but has met with a series of high-level diplomats in Washington. He described a meeting with US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew as "very good". Projects "For the next three days, I'll be meeting people in the IT industry for discussions. Most of them will have projects in Ireland - Amazon, Facebook, Intel and Apple and all the others," he told the Limerick Leader. Asked whether Irish jobs could be under threat if the US drops corporation tax from 35pc to 15pc, Mr Noonan said: "No, that's not being expressed here at all." The minister said it was up to the American people to decide their president. "I'm dealing with the present administration. I've had no contact with him [Mr Trump] at all and didn't look for contact with him," he said. "My trip wasn't related to the election, it was arranged after Brexit. The trip is more of a follow-up to Brexit than anything else." Mr Noonan's US trip is a prelude to a similar one scheduled by Taoiseach Enda Kenny later this month. He will visit New York and San Francisco but a spokesperson said that "at present" there are no plans for talks with Mr Trump. This comes as management at Mr Trump's hotel in Doonbeg, Co Clare, said they are anticipating the incoming president will visit during his tenure. Speaking to Newstalk radio, golf pro at Trump Doonbeg Brian Shaw said: "I would be very surprised if he didn't - very, very surprised... I would be shocked if he didn't make it over." Meanwhile, Siptu has authorised ballots by union members for industrial and possible strike action on public service pay. The decision followed a meeting of the National Executive Council (NEC) at Liberty Hall yesterday. Officials wrote that, over the past year, Siptu and other unions have urged the Government to open negotiations on the Lansdowne Road Agreement to "accelerate" pay restoration. "As of this date, the Government has refused to do so," they wrote. Balloting is to begin on Thursday, December 1.

Gen. Michael Flynn regularly shares conspiracy theories, expletive-filled posts, and racially insensitive sentiments on Twitter and Facebook, a CNN KFile review of his social media presence reveals. Flynn’s son, Michael G. Flynn, shared stories alleging top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin had a connection to the Muslim Brotherhood, pushed a conspiracy theory that Sen. Marco Rubio was a closeted homosexual who abused cocaine, and repeatedly used expletives to attack Trump’s political opponents. The retired general has been offered the role of national security advisor, a transition official told CNN Thursday. The younger Flynn serves as his father’s chief of staff and top aide, attending events alongside his father and working for his father’s consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group. The elder Flynn credited his son with editing his book and frequently tags his son in tweets. In a photo on Facebook, the younger Flynn can be seen walking with Trump backstage. A request for comment sent to Flynn and his son, as well as a spokesperson, was not returned. A spokesperson for the Trump campaign also did not return a request for comment. The younger Flynn, whose Twitter and Facebook are largely dedicated to supporting Trump, has occasionally shared racially insensitive sentiments. In a tweet from January of this year, Flynn responded to a Vox story on Twitter about whites-only dating sites, writing, “@voxdotcom soooo African Americans can have B.E.T. but whites can’t have their own dating site? Hmmm…” (The tweet was deleted after CNN contacted Flynn for comment.) After the 2012 election, Flynn tweeted that minorities only voted for President Barack Obama because of his skin color. “Unfortunately, only reason minorities voted for BO is the color of his skin and NOT for the issues….#Election2012,” Flynn wrote. (The tweet was deleted after CNN contacted Flynn for comment.) Flynn frequently shares unfounded conspiracy theories, like ones claiming Hillary Clinton and President Obama would be tried for treason if Trump is elected. He also posted a unfounded story claiming hackers would release a video of former President Bill Clinton raping a teenage girl. In one post, he called alt-right social commentator Mike Cernovich, who frequently shares unfounded news stories, “a source I trust.” In a Facebook post from October, Flynn shared a fake news story claiming Obama flaunted an erection to female reporters in 2008. Flynn tweeted multiple times unfounded claims about Sen. Marco Rubio’s “coke house, gayish dance troupe, and foam parties.” These tweets included a baseless article about Rubio being a homosexual who lived in a drug house and went to “foam parties” where “mutual masturbation is an occasional component, generally beneath the cover of foam.” On Twitter, the younger Flynn frequently re-tweets Paul Watson, editor for the conspiracy website InfoWars, sometimes using the hashtag “#infowars” himself. His Facebook and Twitter picture are him in an InfoWars t-shirt. In one tweet, Flynn retweeted Watson sharing a video of a woman crying saying “I need an ambulance” because Trump was elected. Watson commented he thought it “might be the best thing ever.” Flynn is also a frequent retweeter of members of the so-called alt-right, retweeting links to videos that discuss whether Clinton campaign chair John Podesta had a “torture chamber” and videos claiming Huma Abedin has ties to the Muslim Brotherhood and Saudi terrorists. He has used the word “cuck” — a shorthand slur for cuck-conservative which combines the word cuckold and conservative — a number of times on social media. Flynn also regularly labels Hillary Clinton, Saturday Night Live, CNN, Sen. Bernie Sanders, President Obama, and others as communists. He labeled Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg socialists in a Facebook post, saying they promote anti-Trump and pro-Hillary views. In another post on Facebook, he called Gloria Allred, an attorney for many of the women who accused Trump of sexual assault, “a commie” who was trying to “get the heat off the witch.” Rubio, Kaine aim to curb rising anti-Semitism in Europe Trump and Japan's Abe meet for 'very candid discussion' in New York Related Posts Rand Paul nabs South Carolina endorsement from Rep.

Photo: Bloomberg The schadenfreude (German for joy in other people’s misery) about the Indian IT industry peaked with the last quarterly results of the major players; a particularly dim article in the foreign media was titled “Indian Software Died Today”. Only a fool would deny that the India’s IT services industry is moving from the hormonal exuberance of adolescence to the cruising speed of adulthood but predictions of its demise or peaking at three million jobs are premature given the many horizons that are emerging: all hardware now needs a software layer; India’s clustering, critical mass and externalities in software rivals China’s in manufacturing; India produces more engineers than China and the US combined, so captive software centres beyond the FANG (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google) like Uber, Airbnb, Expedia, KPMG, J.P. Morgan, etc., are exploding as companies decide technology is a core competence. We make the case for another opportunity: combining the middle-age of India’s IT services industry with the birthing of the India’s private defence industry. Upsides include jobs, defence self-sufficiency, and an innovation ecosystem. The technology-defence virtuous cycle is epitomized by the US. Global positioning systems were conceived for missile guidance systems. The Internet, sensor technology, drones, 3D printing, driverless cars, and Apple’s voice-recognition technology—all have roots in department of defence funds. The defence innovation fund mandated with funding high-risk and high-payoff technology counts Google’s Eric Schmidt and LinkedIn’s Reid Hoffman as board members. At the height of the Cold War, the US government accounted for nearly 50% of every research dollar globally; even now, the $72 billion it invests in R&D is more than double of what Apple, Intel and Google spent last year combined. Israel’s lead in cybersecurity was midwifed by its army and now the world’s largest supercomputer resides at China’s National Military University. Late to the party, India has two advantages: the changing character of warfare and its software ecosystem. The first is obvious. What matters in war is not large forces or heavy firepower but information dominance. This needs a network of networks which acquires enormous amounts of information about the battle space and the adversary, mines it real-time, and enhances capability of the men behind the machines by translating information into effective military action. Some of this network of networks—drones, big data, database administration—already exists but the frontiers of human machine interface need to be pushed by advancing bio-robotics, machine learning, and accelerating human cognition (both for soldiers on the front lines and intelligence analysts in the rear). This needs blurring the boundaries of hardware and software. We want to fence the Line of Control (LoC) but what we need is a state-of-the-art information system, overlaid on the area from the LoC to the hinterlands, that will act as a force multiplier and lower brute manpower numbers. Similar intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance efforts fused with massive data collection and data-mining operations will be critical in urban area operations of the kinds we saw in Kashmir. The Prime Minister’s identification of defence as one of the pillars of Make In India sets up things for convergence; the IT industry is a willing partner but defence research, funding, procurement, and human capital needs policy and institutional change. Currently defence R&D is concentrated in the Defence Research and Development Organization’s (DRDO’s) labs—which are not ready for information-driven warfare. For funding, we need an organization modelled on the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency that will identify and fund frontier defence technology research—the polar opposite of the current DRDO model. This agency will take early-stage bets in dual-use technologies and identify 10 universities and 10 private-sector entities to partner with. In procurement, we need public-private partnerships; our huge spends can catalyze the industry. The worries about a close relationship between defence spending and the private sector creating crony capitalism on steroids are valid but tactical; think of the fall in wholesale corruption in coal and telecom spectrum. There will be accidents as we put in place a new model synergizing defence and technology, but these will not be birth defects. Finally, human capital: we need to create the board proposed in the 2002 Group of Ministers report with representatives from government, academia and private industry. We also need lateral entry into government as the state’s ability to look ahead at the new frontiers of warfare, technology and military organization needs specialization. People will correctly worry about government directed private defence funding being industrial policy; we’ve seen that movie before and know how it ends. But if there was ever an area ripe for “The Entrepreneurial State” advocated by Mariana Mazzucato, it is defence. It’s not clear whether the hacking of US Democratic Party emails happened or Indian ATM cards came from Russia or Pakistan, but it is clear they originated overseas and represent one future of warfare. General George S. Patton reminded us that wars are fought with weapons but won by men; India has a unique chance to reboot both.

Hawkins@andyjayhawk Nov 19, 2016, 5:00pm EST share tweet Linkedin After two years of collaborating on self-driving cars, BMW and Chinese search giant Baidu have ended their partnership, according to multiple reports. Baidu is said to now be searching for a new automaker to team up with as it looks to ramp up its testing of autonomous vehicles in the US. Wang Jing, the head of autonomous car development at Baidu, told Reuters the company was now using cars from Ford's Lincoln in its US testing. "I'm open for any partners, actually I'm talking to many,” Wang said. “I'm open for any partners” Spokespersons for Baidu and BMW declined to comment, but a BMW executive told Reuters that the two companies differed on the direction of their research into autonomous vehicles. “"We now have found that the development pace and the ideas of the two companies are a little different," BMW's China CEO Olaf Kastner said. BMW has said it wants to bring a self-driving car to market by 2021. Baidu was more ambitious, aiming for 2018. There were other signs that the two companies weren’t entirely in lockstep. BMW had forged partnerships with other companies working on autonomous technology, including collision-avoidance detection firm Mobileye and chip-maker Intel. Other signs that the two companies weren’t entirely in lockstep. BMW and Baidu first began collaborating in 2014. At the time, Baidu senior vice president Wang Jin said that his company would launch of a new self-driving car with the German car manufacturer by the following year. The prototype vehicle would be used to test Baidu's autonomous technology, but would still have a human driver present. That vehicle never materialized. But earlier this year, Baidu received an autonomous vehicle testing permit from California’s Department of Motor Vehicles, bringing the Chinese search giant one step closer to testing its self-driving cars on Google’s home turf. The Chinese search company has also been staffing up in Silicon Valley, building up a team of at least 100 engineers.

(聯發科) Taiwan's leading integrated circuit designer, is expected to see its sales for 2016 rise 29 percent from a year earlier, the second-highest growth among the top 20 IC firms in the world, according to market advisory firm IC Insights. <a href="http://ax-d.pixfuture.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=fb1025fdcc&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE"><img src="http://ax-d.pixfuture.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=537134883&cs=fb1025fdcc&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> In a statement posted on its website, IC Insights said that MediaTek has benefited from an increase in shipments to Chinese smartphone brands such as Oppo and Vivo, which has boosted its sales for this year. Smartphone chips account for about 60 percent of MediaTek's total revenue. As a result, IC Insights said, the company is expected to generate US$8.61 billion in sales in 2016, up 29 percent from a year earlier, and a growth rate trailing only a 35 percent increase expected for U.S.-based graphics IC designer Nvidia Corp. among the top 20 IC firms. Due to the strong sales growth, MediaTek is expected to become the 11th-largest IC company in the world in 2016, up two notches from a year earlier, while Nvidia is expected to rank as the 16th-largest, up from 18th, posting US$6.34 billion in sales, IC Insights said. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (台積電), the largest contract chip maker in the world, could post US$29.32 billion in sales in 2016, up 11 percent from a year earlier, to retain the world No. 3 position, IC Insights said. The advisory firm said that United Microelectronics Corp. (聯電), the second-largest contract chip maker in Taiwan, is expected to post US$4.46 billion in sales in 2016, little changed from a year earlier, to remain the 20th-largest IC firm in the world. In 2016, the top 20 IC firms are expected to generate US$282.13 billion in sales, up about 3 percent from 2015, IC Insights said. U.S.-based Intel Corp. is expected to remain the largest IC firm in the world this year after posting US$56.31 billion in sales, up 8 percent from a year earlier, IC Insights said. South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co. is expected to come in second with an estimated US$43.54 billion in sales in 2016, up 4 percent from a year earlier, according to IC Insights. U.S.-based Qualcomm Inc. is expected to post US$15.44 billion in sales in 2016, down 4 percent from a year earlier, but its global ranking is expected to rise to fourth place, IC insights said.

In strident speeches and public comments, including a fiery address at the Republican National Convention, Flynn has aggressively argued that Islamic State militants pose a threat on a global scale and demanded a far more aggressive U.S. military campaign against the group. In a June interview with CNN, Flynn complained the U.S. needs to "discredit" radical Islam, but that "we're not allowed to do that right now." But his comments about Islam, a religion practiced by more than 1.5 billion people worldwide, have at times gone beyond condemning radicals inside the faith. In Flynn's book, "The Field of Fight: How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and its Allies," he condemned U.S. leaders who have called Islam a religion of peace. "This insistence on denying the existence of jihad led President Obama to the absurd claim that the Islamic State has nothing to do with Islam," Flynn wrote. In August, he spoke at an event in Dallas hosted by the anti-Islamist group Act for America, calling Islam a "cancer" and a "political ideology" that "definitely hides behind being a religion." Muslim Advocates, a civil rights group based in California, said in a statement that Flynn's appointment "signals support for anti-Muslim policies and sentiment that will undermine our nation's security and exacerbate an already unsafe climate for Muslims and all Americans." The role of national security adviser has varied by administration, but usually centers on coordinating the policy positions of the secretaries of state, defense, justice and other members of a president's national security team. It is an especially powerful position because of the national security adviser's access to the president in the West Wing of the White House. The adviser acts as a gatekeeper on a wide range of issues, including matters of war and peace as well as diplomacy and intelligence. Flynn, who turns 58 in December, served for more than three decades in the Army following his commissioning in 1981 as a second lieutenant in military intelligence. His career included a stint as director of intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff and intelligence chief for the U.S.-led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. It ended, however, when he was forced to resign from his post as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014 after two turbulent years leading the Pentagon's top spy agency. Flynn traveled last year to Moscow, where he joined Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Russian officials in a celebration of the RT network, a Russian government-controlled television channel. Flynn later explained that he had been paid for taking part in the event, but brushed aside concerns that he was aiding a Russian propaganda effort. Flynn has became a harsh critic of the Obama administration's prosecution of the fight against the Islamic State group and emerged as one of Trump's most vocal backers. Throughout the campaign, Flynn championed many of Trump's foreign policy provisions, including renegotiating a seven-country agreement with Iran aimed at curbing its nuclear program in exchange for a lifting of economic sanctions. Yet while Flynn has publicly issued dark warnings about the risks of Islamic violence, his private consulting firm has lobbied for a company headed by a Turkish businessman tied to Turkey's authoritarian, Islamist-leaning government, which cracked down on dissent and jailed thousands of opponents after a failed coup in July against Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The businessman, Ekim Alptekin, told The Associated Press on Friday that he had no relationship with Erdogan's government, even though he is member of a Turkish foreign economic relations board managed by the country's Economic Ministry. In an op-ed for the Washington newspaper The Hill just before the election, Flynn wrote that Turkey needs support and echoed Erdogan's warnings that a "shady" Turkish Muslim cleric living in Pennsylvania should not be given safe harbor in the U.S. Erdogan has accused the cleric, Fethullah Gullen, of orchestrating the July coup attempt and called for his extradition. The Obama administration has not complied. Alptekin said Friday that Flynn's editorial supporting Erdogan was not connected to his company's lobbying or the Turkish government. "The Turkish government did not order that," he said. The Flynn Intel Group also lobbied Congress even as Flynn joined Trump in a presidential intelligence briefing in August — a possible security misstep, according to several ethics law experts. "If the general was receiving classified information that could affect his business interests, that would be an obvious concern," said Joe Sandler, a campaign ethics lawyer and expert on the law that requires lobbyists for foreign governments to register their activities. Sandler and others also questioned why Flynn's firm registered as lobbyists with Congress instead of the Justice Department's stricter Foreign Agent unit, which requires more detailed reporting of activities under the federal Foreign Agent Registration Act. "If a foreign entity is lobbying Congress with the aim of influencing U.S policy, they're required to file under the foreign agent act," said Lydia Bennett, an expert in foreign agent work with the non-partisan Project on Government Oversight in Washington. Flynn's consulting group registered with Congress as a lobbyist in September for Inovo BV, a company Alptekin set up in the Netherlands in 2005. Alptekin said the lobbying project was designed to support an energy firm that he declined to identify. Kelley and Flynn Intel Group did not respond to calls and emails from the AP, and the Trump transition team did not respond to requests for comment. Flynn said in a statement Kelley provided to Yahoo News that if he returns to the government, "my relationship with my company will be severed."

Tom Cotton. He’s rumored for a position in the Trump administration, but the U.S. Senate has plenty of business ahead. Post-election, what are Cotton’s priorities? We’ll explore. The Aftermath Republicans and Democrats assess the aftermath of the big election. What stats stand out? And where do the two parties go from here? Chris Caldwell, campaign manager for Sen. John Boozman, and Democratic consultant Michael Cook are our guests. Inside the Numbers Plus, we’ll go inside the numbers for 3 numbers that mattered this week in business and politics.

Tune in to Talk Business & Politics in Central Arkansas on KATV Channel 7, Sundays at 9:30 a.m. and in Northeast Arkansas on KAIT-NBC, Sundays at 10 a.m. Coming in January 2017, Talk Business & Politics will air in Northwest Arkansas on KFSM Channel 5 at 10:30 a.m. following “Face the Nation.” THE 2017 FORTUNE CRYSTAL BALL Once again, Fortune has made its annual predictions from its “well-informed” staff “about the people, products, and trends that will matter in 2017.” The election of Donald Trump to the presidency represents a seismic shift in American politics, an event with implications nearly impossible to predict. One casualty of the election, indeed, may be the science of prediction itself: For all their algorithmic gymnastics, pollsters and betting markets were utterly confounded by Trump’s win. Which is why it’s essential to have a prediction tool that relies as much on art (and whimsy) as it does on science. “And this year, for some extra insight, we’ve even teamed up with artificial-intelligence powerhouse IBM Watson, which mined tens of millions of sources to help us spot hidden trends. Here, we offer our well-informed, intuitive take on the stories that will shape business — and much else — in the coming year.” Read on here. AMAZON WANTS TO BE YOUR HOUSEKEEPER In his annual letter to shareholders, Amazon.com founder and CEO Jeff Bezos wrote, “We want Prime to be such a good value, you’d be irresponsible not to be a member,” posts Forbes. “To make good on that proposition, Amazon currently offers free two-day deliveries on over 30 million items, free same-day deliveries on hundreds of thousands of products, free video streaming of original series and other programming, free storage on the Amazon Cloud, the Kindle Lending Library, discounted rates on its new streaming music subscription services… The list goes on.” Now, according to reports, it appears as though Amazon plans to add housekeeping services as a perk for its Prime members. Read on at this link. HOW A NEW CEO CAN MAKE A FIRM MORE ENTREPRENEURIAL “A new face at the top brings new hopes, and often, new strategic priorities,” says Harvard Business Review. “When Target hired Brian Cornell as CEO in 2014, expectations were high that he would inject fresh energy into one of the largest U.S. retail chains. When that same year Microsoft replaced CEO Steve Ballmer with Satya Nadella, the move signaled the possibility for major change. Indeed, the company eventually announced its strategy to venture massively into cloud computing.” When new CEOs take charge, they sometimes change or even reverse the entire strategic course of the company – a course that, such as in the case of Microsoft, often aligns with entrepreneurial growth opportunities. Newly appointed CEOs might consider such an entrepreneurial focus attractive for various reasons. Following an entrepreneurial strategy ultimately means that managers and employees of a firm act more proactively and innovatively, and they take more risks — all which is known to drive growth and increase a firm’s advantage against competitors. “Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice shows that new CEOs indeed change a firm’s strategy and that this change tends to go into a more entrepreneurial direction. Interestingly, we found CEOs hired from the outside are more likely to change a firm’s strategy more drastically. However, insider CEOs are more likely to adopt new entrepreneurial strategies much sooner.” There are several reasons for the shift to more entrepreneurial strategies.

THE MYTHS DEMOCRATS SWALLOWED THAT COST THEM THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION An editorial writer for The Scoop posts, “I have no problem with anyone who voted for Trump, because they wanted a Trump presidency. I have an enormous problem with anyone who voted for Trump or Stein or Johnson — or who didn’t vote at all — and who now expresses horror about the outcome of this election. If you don’t like the consequences of your own actions, shut the hell up.” The problem this election season has been that liberal Democrats — just like too many Republicans — have been consumed by provably false conspiracy theories. They have trafficked in them on Facebook and Twitter, they have read only websites that confirm what they want to believe, and they have, in the past few months, unknowingly gulped down Russian propaganda with delight. In other words, just like the conservatives they belittle, they have been inside a media bubble that blocked them from reality. So before proceeding, let’s address a few fantasies about this campaign: Here. TRUMP TEAM PLANNING SPECIAL VICTORY TOUR POLITICO posts, “President-elect Donald Trump will be embarking on a ‘victory tour’ to the states he carried, a campaign aide told reporters Thursday.” “We’re working on a victory tour now; it will happen in the next couple of weeks,” said George Gigicos, the campaign’s advance team director, who briefly talked about Trump’s first trip, according to pool reports. For more on this story, go to this link. THE DIVIDE BETWEEN CITY AND COUNTRY “The 2016 election exposed a chasm between urban and non-urban America that will likely widen under a Trump administration,” says The Atlantic. The earthquake that elected Donald Trump has left the United States approaching 2020 with a political landscape reminiscent of 1920. Not since then has the cultural chasm between urban and non-urban America shaped the struggle over the country’s direction as much as today. Of all the overlapping generational, racial, and educational divides that explained Trump’s stunning upset over Hillary Clinton last week, none proved more powerful than the distance between the Democrats’ continued dominance of the largest metropolitan areas, and the stampede toward the GOP almost everywhere else. “Trump’s victory was an empire-strikes-back moment for all the places and voters that feel left behind in an increasingly diverse, post-industrial, and urbanized America. Squeezing bigger margins from smaller places, Trump overcame a tide of resistance in the largest metropolitan areas that allowed Clinton to carry the national popular vote, but not the decisive Electoral College.” “This election thus carved a divide between cities and non-metropolitan areas as stark as American politics has produced since the years just before and after 1920. That year marked a turning point: It was the first time the Census recorded that more people lived in urban than non-urban areas. That tangible sense of shifting influence triggered a series of political and social conflicts between big cities teeming with immigrants, many of them Catholic, and small towns and rural communities that remained far more homogeneously, white, native-born, and Protestant.” For the complete post, follow this link. THE FIREWORKS OF THE FUTURE “In the 18 minutes it takes to blow up 30-some tons of fireworks for the Fourth of July show on the National Mall in D.C., it costs the government more than 200 grand. Bigger shows—like the massive Macy’s show in New York City—can cost millions,” reports Fast Company. “Fireworks also make local air pollution spike, and can pollute water and soil when chemicals and heavy metals shower down from the pyrotechnics.” But everyone likes a show. So Intel is attempting to pioneer an alternative that’s just as mesmerizing to watch: hundreds of drones, choreographed into a spectacular light display. The company first tested the idea in 2015, in an experiment with 100 manually programmed drones. Now they’ve unveiled a new drone, called the Shooting Star, designed for light shows. An algorithm automatically programs the drones to fly in formation, and a single pilot can run the display. Prepare to be amazed here. MUSK SAYS TELSA’S SOLAR SHINGLES WILL COST LESS THAN A DUMB ROOF Bloomberg reports, “It’s official: After Tesla shareholders approved the acquisition of SolarCity, the new company is now an unequivocal sun-to-vehicle energy firm. And Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk didn’t take long to make his first big announcement as head of this new enterprise.” Minutes after shareholders approved the deal — about 85 percent of them voted yes — Musk told the crowd that he had just returned from a meeting with his new solar engineering team. Tesla’s new solar roof product, he proclaimed, will actually cost less to manufacture and install than a traditional roof—even before savings from the power bill. “Electricity,” Musk said, “is just a bonus.” “If Musk’s claims prove true, this could be a real turning point in the evolution of solar power. The rooftop shingles he unveiled just a few weeks ago are something to behold: They’re made of textured glass and are virtually indistinguishable from high-end roofing products. They also transform light into power for your home and your electric car.” More on this incredible new Telsa rooftop at this link. AN ENTIRE MBA INTO ONE ONLINE COURSE Business Insider says, “If your’e looking to sharpen your finance knowledge before diving in, Udemy is currently offering a course just for you. Chris Haroun has guest lectured and advised at McGill and Columbia Universities, respectively, worked a Goldman Sachs, and authored “101 Crucial Lessons They Don’t Teach You in Business School,” which was recently named by Forbes magazine as “1 of 6 books that all entrepreneurs need to read right now”.” Haroun has taken lessons he’s taught at universities in the past and condensed them into one course that he describes as “an entire MBA.” “Through the class students will learn macro and micro economics, how to value companies, and the basics of how investment banks and management consulting firms work. In addition to the nuts and bolts, Haroun aims to teach his students about the importance of personal connections and professional presentation: how to identify and pitch venture capitalists and communicate your ideas clearly and concisely. And talk about a Black Friday deal. You’ll be amazed at how much this course costs. But you’d better hurry. Course details at this link.

Which means the people you hire – particularly if they're ideologues – can profoundly shape the way you govern more than 300 million lives. Give Chris Christie this much: He had tried to appoint a few competent and experienced public servants to Donald Trump's transition team, such as former Rep. Mike Rogers, the former House Intelligence Committee chairman who was tapped to lead the national security unit for the incoming administration. But Rogers was forced out in the internecine war, and numerous reports say he has been replaced by Frank Gaffney, who seems to have turned anti-Muslim fearmongering into a full-time job since he was run out of the Reagan Administration. Consider Gaffney's greatest hits. The birther movement? Gaffney got there first. He was the first to write during the 2008 campaign that President Obama is a secret Muslim who wasn't born in the U.S., and that Muslims backed his candidacy financially. He said there's a deep-rooted Muslim infiltration of the U.S. government, and that two Muslim congressmen should be banned from the House Intel Committee Intelligence because they would leak info to the Muslim Brotherhood. Republicans aren't immune: Gaffney accused Grover Norquist, the anti-tax zealot, of ties to Islamic infiltrators; suggested that Gen. David Petraeus was submitting to Sharia for condemning a Koran burning; and he accused Christie of treason for appointing Muslim judge Sohail Mohammed to Superior Court. And most dangerously, a survey from Gaffney's group – the Center for Security Policy – is cited as the centerpiece of Trump's proposal to ban Muslims from entering the country. Trump once suggested that he could compensate for his lack of government experience by hiring "the best people" to guide him through the steps. But instead his policy is being shaped by a lunatic conspiracy theorist whom the Southern Poverty Law Center calls "one of America's most dangerous Islamaphobes." That's your new democracy, America.

Miller November 18, 2016 10 Comments IoT promises to be more than just what we see today; new examples appeared at Techonomy as the debate over the devices continued. The many different applications of the Internet of Things (IoT), the new business models that IoT enables, and the issues involved in securing and regulating these were a big topic at last week's Techonomy 2016 conference. I was particularly interested in hearing about several new examples of IoT uses and more concrete ideas regarding regulations and security. The Vast Internet of Things One interesting panel covered some of the more unusual projects that are now being considered as part of the Internet of Things. Sara Gardner of Hitachi Insight Group (above, second from the left) discussed using IOT to automate factories, to help companies move from selling products to offering services, and for improving "social infrastructure" like transportation and energy. Gardner discussed using IoT devices to improve safety in places like mines, where remote operation might help keep people safe, and things such as facial recognition on cows in agriculture, to improve herd management. Eric Topol of the Scripps Research Institute (third from left) talked about "digitizing our bodies" using information taken from electrocardiograms, and devices to monitor conditions such as sleep apnea and ear infections. The goal is to anticipate problems before they occur, furthering preventative care. Usually, Topol said, this happens with wearables, not through sensors embedded in the body, though in some cases—such as preventing heart attacks—embedded devices may prove necessary. Topol said the concept of the hospital as we know it today will change. Instead of waiting weeks to get an appointment with a primary care physician, he anticipates future doctor visits will often involve video chats and data exchange, possibly supplemented by a doctor visiting you. People should only have to go to a hospital for very specific procedures, like surgery. One issue, he said, is that a patient needs to own his or her data. Topol said that right now everyone has that data except for the patient; this situation has to change. "Medical technology will completely reboot healthcare," he said. Tom Barton of Planet Labs (far left) talked about the company's goal of imaging all of the land area of the planet at least once a day using consumer electronics in order to build much smaller, much less costly satellites. Barton said the company has already launched fifty satellites and plans to launch another hundred. Most of the company's customers today are in agriculture and government, and he described applications ranging from land use categorization and tracking deforestation to improving agricultural yield management and the size of the global food supply. Smart Cities and Smart Seas (Gaudette and Regas) Another panel discussed the concept of "smart cities" and how this is much more complicated than it is often portrayed. Martin Powell of the Siemens Global Cities Centre of Competence discussed how using data to create "smart cities" might have different impacts than you would expect, such as how banning bikes in London would actually reduce pollution. Mrinalini Ingram of Verizon talked about how citizens are now able to play a larger part in the process of managing cities. Moderator Gary Bolles mentioned that so many people use Waze in L.A. that residents in some newly-trafficked zones are complaining or trying to feed the app false information. Powell said that generally you can't give citizens planning decisions, but you do need to take data, aggregate it, and control it at the municipal level. Assaf Biderman of MIT's SENSEable City Lab said citizens need to feel a sense of ownership of data, though some things can't be voted on. He also said that many offerings won't come from the cities themselves but will instead come from the outside. A panel on "smart shipping" talked about bringing IoT concepts to shipping, with moderator Simone Ross noting that despite 90 percent of global trade moving on the oceans, this is a "data dead zone." Peter Platzer of Spire Global talked about his company's plans to use small satellites to traverse the ocean three or four times an hour instead of only a few times a day, while Anthony DiMare of Nautilus Labs discussed his firm's plans to bring big data analytics to the shipping industry, asserting that Nautilus could use data and analytics to reduce fuel usage by as much as 30 percent. John Kao of maritime security firm Thayer Mahan discussed the problem of visualization from the top of the ocean down, saying that this issue has important implications for mining, fishing, and geopolitical affairs. Platzer noted that there is currently $10 billion in annual piracy on the seas, and said 80 percent of the time we don't know exactly where the ships are. Kao agreed with others that there are few laws and no overarching framework on maritime security, and talked about how we have little monitoring of undersea cables or ports. All of the panelists agreed that in the years to come we must develop the ability to know more about the location of ships on the ocean, as well as what the conditions are underwater. Another area covered was the power grid, and using IoT to combat climate change. Robert Gaudette of independent power provider NRG Energy said that IoT creates a whole lot of demand for energy, but also help us to manage the load on the grid. Diane Regas of the Environmental Defense Fund said that some countries have now gone up to four days using only renewable energy, but agreed that IoT could open up new energy solutions, including allowing people to adjust both the demand side of energy as well as energy production. She addressed the issue of incentives for the utility companies and said this must change from utilities being rewarded in terms of how they invest, to the utilities being rewarded by performance, which would include how much they lower emissions. Medical Applications (Tas and Tyson) Perhaps the sector most ripe for change is health care. "We have a real opportunity to transform the health care system in this country, and indeed the world," Kaiser Permanente CEO Bernard Tyson said. In the past year the majority of Kaiser interactions with patients took place using a "care anywhere" model; a secure "e-visit" over a phone, tablet, or PC, instead of a patient going to the hospital. Tyson explained that Kaiser is a fully integrated system—it brings together insurance coverage and health care—and that this model is designed to facilitate prevention, early detection, and early treatment. Philips CEO Jeroen Tas said that 80 percent of the cost of health care today is related to chronic disease, which is often influenced by social factors as well as personal choice. Today health care is reimbursed around acute events, but it should instead be covered based on the outcome. "If you pay for sickness, you get sickness; if you pay for health, you get health," Tas said. Tas suggested we need a new way of delivering care, and that much of it will no longer take place in a hospital. Instead, friends and families could be part of a new way of organizing care. He mentioned that the UK's National Health System now has 1.5 million volunteers to assist with care. Both men agreed that you can reduce health care costs, but only if you reimburse on outcomes, not on care, with Tyson noting that Kaiser doesn't get more money by having more patients in its hospitals. Tyson noted that medical devices can augment humans, in terms of helping to make early detection available before a problem develops. As examples he mentioned warning about dehydration, measuring blood sugar in people with diabetes, and simply checking to determine if medications are being reordered properly, which gives an indication that they are being taken. (There was a suggestion that half of all medication is not actually consumed.) Tas suggested that AI will play a bigger role in making sure the trail of diagnosis, treatment, and medication prescribed stays within the patient record, making it easier for doctors, patients, and clinicians to easily access pertinent information. He is seeing a lot of progress in this area, and in a couple of years, the systems will often support decision-making. The Role of Government In a separate conversation on IoT and the U.S government, Intel president Murthy Renduchintala envisioned an environment that fuses together computing, pervasive and ambient communications, and advanced machine learning. He talked about computing and intelligence at the edge of such an environment being able to contribute information to a central data repository and then receive aggregated information after it is processed. Overall, he said, the U.S. does a good job of gathering information, but many other countries have a head start in areas like regulation for self-driving cars, or smart cities. In technology, the U.S. is doing a phenomenal job, but "in terms of harnessing technology, we've got some catching up to do." Renduchintala said areas such as autonomous driving, robots, and drones seem to demand some degree of legislative involvement, and talked about possibilities as to when such systems may go mainstream. He talked about three main areas where the government could get involved: basic legislation, or understanding what is happening and how the government can be catalyzing technology to move forward; a national R&D strategy, which is about making sure everyone is playing in the same sandbox, and especially in areas like autonomous driving and drone regulation; and finally, the government must play a key role when it comes to security, noting this isn't just about the end device, but also about protecting information as it is transferred over very large networks. Renduchintala said there is a burden on industry to better educate everyone concerned, including Congress. He expects to see an economic benefit from IoT, particularly in areas such as autonomous cars, because people spend a lot of time in traffic jams that could be better harnessed in productive areas. GE and "Productivity of Things" GE Digital's Bill Ruh (right) talked GE's digital transformation. We are moving from a world where owning an asset is the value to one where the data and services around the asset are becoming more important. A few years ago, he said, GE CEO Jeffrey Immelt could see that the combination of data, AI, and statistics coming together could make assets more efficient and that a company that could figure out how to best maintain and use the assets had the potential to disrupt GE. So, the company decided to get out in front of this transformation. Over the next three to five years, every industrial company will go through this transition. "If they don't, someone else will," Ruh said. Ruh discussed GE's "digital twin" concept and said that while AI is great, it only addresses part of the problem unless you know the details of the actual physical device. Instead, the company combines modeling and AI to run simulations—starting with digital twins for wind farms, and then moving into other areas such as power plants and rail networks, with systems designed to figure out the order in which to move trains within a system. Many of these decisions were not intuitive, he said. Overall, Ruh said, the most important takeaway has been the "productivity of things," and said the three sexiest words in the industrial world are "zero unplanned downtime." Ruh said he worries about trade policies and data sovereignty, but that in the end, it's a job issue. He noted that we have seen slower GDP growth and an increase in automation that has in turn driven down lower-skill jobs. Ruh said that while automation will happen, we may see a shift from labor arbitrage automation to local content, with more manufacturing moving local, in part due to things such as additive manufacturing (3D printing). "We don't know how it will play out," he said. Ruh did say that regulation will be needed, but that it needs to be smart and not unintentionally block innovation. Securing the Internet of Things (Bartolomeo, Cooper, Eagan, Rill, Higginbotham) Stacey Higginbotham of the Internet of Things Podcast moderated a session on IoT security and pointed to things like the recent Mirai botnet, which used millions of old connected webcams to produce a recent distributed denial-of-service attack that left many websites unreachable for some time. Mark Bartolomeo, VP of Internet of Things M2M Connected Solutions at Verizon, agreed that security is a huge problem, but said it is a problem we're solving. Bartolomeo pushed for more security standards for devices but said we also need network security, host and IT security, and better employee training. He said security is "a problem we'll never stop working on," pointing to Verizon's recent study of 100,000 breaches. (Later, I had a good conversation with him about how quickly Verizon expects IoT to grow as connectivity prices decline, and also about the complexity of deploying such systems today and the need for better security.) Betsy Cooper, executive director of the Berkeley Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity, said we cannot fully be secure. Her group works on many possible scenarios. There is always a risk of a small degree of failure, she said. Darktrace CEO Nicole Eagan said there is no perimeter anymore, and agreed that if you have a sophisticated threat actor, they will get in. Instead, Eagan said, it is important to have visibility into devices to see what is going on and react accordingly. To that end, her firm's product emulates the human immune system. Chris Rill, co-founder and CTO at Canary, which makes a wireless home security product, said one big question is who you are trying to protect yourself from. Protecting systems from "script kiddies" is possible, he said, but defending against government actors is much harder. Rill said some companies like his really care about security, while others just treat it as a checkbox feature. While he hopes that in the future security will help drive demand for particular products, he admitted that consumers generally don't ask for the most secure products. The panel discussed various ways of making sure devices are secured, with a number pointing to ICSA certification in multiple layers of devices. Rill talked about how Canary specifically doesn't open more ports than necessary, while Eagan talked about how connectivity concerns have led many devices, including most video conferencing systems and even nuclear power plants, to be vulnerable to specific attacks. She said if you can watch network traffic, you can detect anomalous behaviors early before damage is done, and that the next step will be "algorithm vs. algorithm," particularly as nation-states start tapping into math experts to create their own AIs. Regulation was also a big topic, with Cooper decrying the "balkanization of cybersecurity regulation." Cooper said we need to get the right players in the same room, and suggested that the person in charge of cybersecurity at the White House should have elevated responsibilities. Eagan noted that lots of devices are not actually created in the U.S., and Rill talked about some of the steps Canary has taken to ensure it knew every component that goes into its product during their manufacture in China.
