You want people to pay $2,399 for a laptop with last year's CPU and last year's midrange graphics chip? You must think consumers are suckers." Those were my initial thoughts when looking at the spec sheet for Microsoft's new Surface Book with Performance Base, which uses outdated components but still costs significantly more than laptops with more processing power. However, after having done some competitive analysis, I have to admit that Microsoft's laptop is still unique in the industry and might just be worth the price. A Year Behind the Times While every other premium 2-in-1 released this fall uses Intel's new 7th Generation "Kaby Lake" processors, and all the new graphics or gaming-oriented laptops employ Nvidia's 10-Series GPUs, the Surface Book with Performance Base is still stuck in 2015. This just-released system has the same Intel 6th Generation Core i7 CPU as the original Surface Book that was released last November and an Nvidia GTX 965M chip that launched 22 months ago. The issue is that Microsoft didn't actually update the Surface Book's brain at all but only its keyboard dock, which contains the graphics chip. The detachable screen — which contains the processor, RAM, storage and other key components — is the exact same one that rolled out in 2015. You can take a Surface Book you bought last year and put its top onto the new Performance Base, and it'll be exactly the same as the new Surface Book you get today. It's also lame that the new Performance Base, like the original, doesn't have a single USB Type-C port on board when even $400 laptops like the Asus E403SA support this vital new connector. Microsoft's laptop should have Thunderbolt 3, which uses a USB Type-C port but quadruples the transfer speed and can output to dual 4K monitors over a single connection. MORE: Thunderbolt 3 Explained: Why You Need the World's Fastest Port The Dell XPS 13 starts at just $799 — one-third the price of the Surface Book with Performance Base — and comes standard with Thunderbolt 3. Considering that the Surface Book is targeted at creative professionals, many of whom need to transfer large files or work with 4K cameras, omitting Thunderbolt 3 is particularly shortsighted. What Makes the Surface Book Unique With its choice of older components and ports, Microsoft is a bit behind the industry. However, when it comes to design and performance for its size and unique design, the Surface Book still comes out on top. The 2-in-1 market is growing faster than any other PC segment, according to data from market research firm IDC,  with dozens of laptop-tablet hybrids available from the likes of Acer, Asus, Dell, HP and Lenovo. All of these computers fall into one of two categories: convertible laptops with screens that bend back 360 degrees into slate mode, and tablets with detachable keyboards. The Surface Book has a screen that completely separates its keyboard, but it feels more like a clamshell laptop than any other detachable 2-in-1. Most other detachables have thin keyboard covers that make them feel unbalanced and unsubstantial on your lap. The Surface Book not only has a good weight balance between its keyboard and screen, but also places a GPU, an active cooling system, a full array of ports and most of its battery cells in its base. Microsoft's 2-in-1 performs better and lasts a lot longer on a charge when it's all in one piece. In fact, the tablet portion alone lasts only about 3 hours on a charge — enough time for a quick project — but that endurance jumps to 12 hours with the keyboard attached. How Other Laptops Stack Up The Nvidia GTX 965M GPU in the Surface Book's Performance Base isn't the latest and greatest, but it is powerful enough to play most high-end games at medium settings. By contrast, you won't find another detachable with an Nvidia GPU in the base, and even among bend-back convertibles, discrete graphics chips are very rare and not very powerful. The much larger and heavier Dell Inspiron 17 7000 has a low-end Nvidia 940M GPU, while the Lenovo ThinkPad P40 Yoga has business-oriented Nvidia Quadro M500M graphics. Neither of these chips is good enough for serious gaming. If you're not planning to play games or create 3D animations, you'll be fine with a 2-in-1 that has integrated graphics. Among convertibles that are similar in size and weight to the Surface Book, we love the HP Spectre x360 for consumers and the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga for more serious productivity and business work. The 13-inch HP Spectre x360 weighs about three-quarters of a pound less than the Surface Book and comes with a 7th Generation Core i7 CPU, 8GB of RAM, a 256GB solid-state drive and a USB Type-C port for just $1,149 — $450 less than a Surface Book with a 6th Generation Core i5 CPU, integrated graphics (not Performance Base model) and the same storage and RAM. The cheapest Surface Book with a Core i7 goes for $2,099 but also comes with discrete graphics (the older custom Nvidia GPU, not the GTX 965M). Microsoft's laptop, however, comes with an active stylus and a 3000 x 2000 screen, which is much sharper than the Spectre's 1920 x 1080 panel. The ThinkPad X1 Yoga also has a 13-inch screen and a sub-3-pound chassis, but it comes with an active stylus. An X1 Yoga with a 6th Gen Core i7, 8GB of RAM, a 256GB SSD and a 1920 x 1080 screen currently goes for $1,356, but we'd get it with the vibrant 2560 x 1440 OLED display, which ups the price to $1,596. If you just want a lightweight laptop with discrete graphics and you don't care about turning it into a tablet, you can get the Asus ZenBook UX303UB, which costs just $1,164 and comes with a 6th Generation Core i7 CPU, 12GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, and a 3200 x 1800, 13-inch touch screen. However, it has low-end, Nvidia 940M graphics. If you're willing to get a 15-inch laptop that weighs nearly pound more than the Surface Book, you can get Dell's XPS 15 with GTX 960M, which is just a slight step below the 965M, along with a 6th Gen Core i7 CPU, 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD, for $1,399. What's next? The Surface Book with Performance Base is really a new high-end configuration of the 2015 model, not a new model in its own right. We've expected manufacturers to release refreshed laptops every time Intel releases a new processor generation, but Microsoft isn't doing that. Instead, we may see the company release a revamped Surface Book sometime in 2017. "There are enough rumors about more comprehensive refreshes in the beginning of 2017 that says that this was an interim step to add a little value in the top-of-the-line product and hold off on a full-blown update until they are ready to focus on it," Stephen Baker, an industry analyst for market research firm NPD, told me. Should you buy the new Surface Book? Whether you plunk down $2,399 for the Surface Book with Performance Base or just $1,499 for the base model, you're paying a high premium for its unique design. But it's a design that's more valuable than any of the components inside because it changes the way you use your laptop. If you have your eye on a Surface Book but don't need to make a purchase anytime soon, you may want to wait and see if the company releases a true refresh next spring. The new model will certainly have better performance and may also provide stronger battery life and a better port selection. Shoppers who don't need discrete graphics or the ability to pop off the screen can get a fantastic convertible 2-in-1 like the HP Spectre x360 or the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga for hundreds of dollars less than Microsoft's laptop. However, if you want the best detachable design and the strongest performance available today, the Surface Book is probably your best choice. ✖ Laptop Guide Laptop Buying Guide: 8 Essential Tips The Best & Worst Laptop Brands Laptop Tech Support Showdown: Undercover Report Should I Buy a Chromebook?

Will it support at least 1 SST 4K monitor at 60Hz? Will it drive 2 via the dock? Razak Nazeer Says: November 5th, 2016 at 4:12 pm Not a well researched article...please consult other leading expert before writing such article, that does not mention the Dell XPS 13 2016 with Kaby Lake at all. Shame. kesztio Says: November 1st, 2016 at 1:43 am “This just-released system has the same Intel 6th Generation Core i7 CPU as the original Surface Book that was released last November” Hmm… there’s a hitch somewhere. Isn’t it the very-very first quad core Surface Book ever released? In this case how the CPU could be identical to the last year released Surface book? (Unfortunately for me the quad core CPU is mandatory. Speaking about performance I’d be happy with something lower spec e.g. i5 HQ or even the latest AMD and don’t need graphic power at all as I’ll use the laptop exclusively for work. But I cannot develop, debug and test efficiently a multiprocessor-optimized application on a dual-core system.) Jonathan Becker Says: October 28th, 2016 at 10:22 am I think the reviewer misunderstands the purpose of the NVidia GPU in this machine. It's for Photoshop, which gets a serious performance boost from a GPU. Same with other Adobe apps. And USB-c might be a nice buzzword, but for actual productivity, it remains irrelevant. Jason Robinson Says: October 27th, 2016 at 7:00 pm With them probably releasing a Surface Book 2 in about 6-7 months, it does give one pause for thought there. Great machine though.

Apple Press Release Apple unveils groundbreaking new MacBook Pro Revolutionary Touch Bar, Breakthrough Performance in Apple’s Thinnest and Lightest Pro Design Ever The all-new MacBook Pro revolutionizes the notebook user experience. Cupertino, California — Apple today introduced the thinnest and lightest MacBook Pro ever, along with a breakthrough interface that replaces the traditional row of function keys with a brilliant, Retina-quality Multi-Touch display called the Touch Bar. The new MacBook Pro features Apple’s brightest and most colorful Retina display yet, the security and convenience of Touch ID, a more responsive keyboard, a larger Force Touch trackpad and an audio system with double the dynamic range. It’s also the most powerful MacBook Pro ever, featuring sixth-generation quad-core and dual-core processors, up to 2.3 times the graphics performance over the previous generation, super-fast SSDs and up to four Thunderbolt 3 ports. The groundbreaking Touch Bar dynamically adapts to the application you’re using. The Touch Bar places controls right at the user’s fingertips and adapts when using the system or apps like Mail, Finder, Calendar, Numbers, GarageBand, Final Cut Pro X and many more, including third-party apps. For example, the Touch Bar can show Tabs and Favorites in Safari, enable easy access to emoji in Messages, provide a simple way to edit images or scrub through videos in Photos and so much more. The Touch Bar, a built-in Retina Multi-Touch display above the keyboard, was designed to boost creativity and productivity. “This week marks the 25th anniversary of Apple’s first notebook; through the years each generation has introduced new innovations and capabilities, and it’s fitting that this all-new generation of MacBook Pro is the biggest leap forward yet,” said Phil Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. “With the groundbreaking new Touch Bar, the convenience of Touch ID, the best Mac display ever, powerful performance, improved audio, blazing-fast storage and Thunderbolt 3 connectivity in our thinnest and lightest pro notebook yet, the new MacBook Pro is the most advanced notebook ever made.” Thinnest and Lightest MacBook Pro Ever The lightest MacBook Pro ever also features a larger trackpad and the most responsive keyboard ever. Building on innovations pioneered in MacBook, the new MacBook Pro features an entirely new enclosure design and all-metal unibody construction that creates an incredibly rigid and dense notebook that is amazingly thin and light. At just 14.9 mm thin, the 13-inch MacBook Pro is 17 percent thinner and 23 percent less volume than the previous generation, and nearly half a pound lighter at just three pounds. The new 15-inch MacBook Pro, at just 15.5 mm thin, is 14 percent thinner and 20 percent less volume than before, and weighing just four pounds, is nearly half a pound lighter. Touch ID Comes to the Mac Touch ID enables quick and secure purchases with Apple Pay simply by reading your fingerprint. Integrated into the power button is the convenience and security of Touch ID, one of the great features customers have come to know and love from their iPhone and iPad. Once you enroll your fingerprint in Touch ID on your MacBook Pro, you can quickly unlock your Mac, switch user accounts and make secure purchases with Apple Pay on the web with a single touch. Touch ID enables a quick, accurate reading of your fingerprint and uses sophisticated algorithms to recognize and match it with the Secure Enclave in the new Apple T1 chip. Apple’s Brightest, Most Colorful Notebook Display MacBook Pro’s Retina display is brighter, thinner and supports wider color gamut, making it the best notebook display ever made. The best Mac display ever delivers images that are more vivid, reveal even greater detail and appear more lifelike than ever. As thin as a MacBook display at .88 mm, the Retina display on the new MacBook Pro at 500 nits of brightness, is an amazing 67 percent brighter than the previous generation, features 67 percent more contrast and is the first Mac notebook display to support wider color gamut. And with power-saving technologies like a larger pixel aperture, a variable refresh rate and more power-efficient LEDs, the display consumes 30 percent less energy than before. The Most Powerful MacBook Pro Yet Power up to 130 percent more graphics performance on the new 15-inch MacBook Pro. Powerful processors, cutting-edge graphics, blazing-fast SSDs, high-speed memory and an advanced thermal architecture deliver amazing pro-level performance in a dramatically thinner enclosure. Sixth-generation dual-core Core i5 with eDRAM, dual-core Core i7 with eDRAM and quad-core Core i7 Intel processors deliver pro-level processing performance while conserving energy. The new 15-inch MacBook Pro features powerful Radeon Pro discrete graphics delivering up to 2.3 times more performance than the previous generation; while the 13-inch MacBook Pro comes with Intel Iris Graphics that are up to two times faster than before. All models feature SSDs with sequential read speeds over 3GBps and Thunderbolt 3, which consolidates data transfer, charging and twice the video bandwidth in a single port — allowing users to drive a 5K display and power their MacBook Pro with a single cable. The new MacBook Pro is available in a 13-inch model and 13- and 15-inch models with the Touch Bar. The new MacBook Pro also offers: Much larger Force Touch trackpads — 46 percent larger on the 13-inch MacBook Pro and twice as large on the 15-inch MacBook Pro; More responsive and comfortable typing on the keyboard with a second-generation butterfly mechanism; Louder, more true-to-life sound through speakers with double the dynamic range and improved bass; macOS Sierra, the world’s most advanced desktop operating system, with new features like Siri integration, Universal Clipboard, Apple Pay on the web and Photos, which helps you rediscover your meaningful memories, organize your library and perfect shots like a pro.

TRENDING NOW: Watch Dogs 2 first impressions Home News Laptops Apple's new MacBook Pro powered by AMD Polaris GPU Apple's new MacBook Pro announced, 15-inch model rocks AMD's new Radeon Pro graphics GPU By: Anthony Garreffa | Laptops News | Posted: Oct 27, 2016 11:37 pm Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Apple has unveiled their new refreshed line of MacBook Pro laptops, with two new 13-inch models and a single higher-end 15-inch model that rocks Radeon Pro 450 graphics from AMD.     The lower-end 13-inch MBP features a dual-core Intel Core i5 processor at 2GHz, 8GB of RAM, 256GB SSD, 2 x Thunderbolt 3 ports and Intel Iris Graphics 540 - but it's the higher-end 13-inch MBP where the fun begins.     Specs, Including AMD Radeon Pro Graphics     Apple has refreshed its MacBook Pro line up with some slightly beefier hardware, with Apple noting the new display on the MacBook Pro is 67% brighter, 67% higher contrast, and has 25% more colors than the MacBook.   The higher-end 15-inch MBP features a quad-core processor from Intel in the form of a Core i7 CPU, with 16GB of 2133MHz RAM, an SSD up to 2TB, and AMD's new Radeon Pro 450 GPU. The new 15-inch MBP will be much faster than its predecessor, with a 130% jump over the 3D graphics specs compared to its predecessor.   Apple's higher-end 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro models come with 4 x Thunderbolt 3 ports, with two on each side - but all of them support USB-C, so you'll be fine. There is no SD card reader, which might leave some people (myself included) a little upset.   The 13-inch MBP is also much thinner, coming in at just 14.9mm thick compared to the older model which is much thicker, at 18mm.     Touch Bar + Touch ID     Apple's higher-end 13-inch MacBook Pro rocks the new Touch Bar and Touch ID features, with the Touch Bar at the top of the MBP being the big OLED strip we've been hearing rumors about for months. The Touch Bar responds to both gestures and taps, with Apple noting that it will work in specific software like Safari - where your bookmarks and a back button will be displayed. If you're using iPhoto, then you'll have buttons to help flip through your pictures and edit them.     Fingerprint security is now a thing with the MacBook Pro, with Apple including a Touch ID sensor in the Touch Bar, which is in the far right-hand side where the power button used to reside.   BGR notes that the new Touch Bar can serve as a "handy autocorrect tool", so if you're like me and live inside of Word, emails, or right now - inside of Chrome writing this content, the Touch Bar will really help your workflow. You can even throw in some emojis from the Touch Bar, which is a nice addition.     Battery Life & macOS Sierra   Apple noted that the new MacBook Pro rocks the latest OS from the company, macOS Sierra, which should provide around 10 hours of battery life.   Pricing & Availability   13-inch MacBook Pro - $1499 13-inch MacBook Pro (Touch Bar/Touch ID) - $1799 15-inch MacBook Pro (Touch Bar/Touch ID) - $2399   Apple will begin taking orders of the new MacBook Pro models this week, with the two Touch Bar-capable models to start shipping in the next 2-3 weeks.

By Dallon Adams — October 27, 2016 4:03 PM Subscribe to this topic Get our daily Tech News recap Mentioned here Dell XPS One 27 MSRP $0.00 DT Recommended Product Learn More After much anticipation, Microsoft has finally unveiled the Surface Studio at a press event in New York City. This all-in-one unit adds a unique, top-of-the-line desktop model to the existing Surface lineup. It’s a great option for group collaborations and creative professionals, particularly because it comes outfitted with a 28-inch display that touts 4,500 x 3,000-pixel resolution and the ability to lie nearly flat. It might showcase a hefty price tag and pack last-gen innards — Nvidia GTX 965M, anyone? — but it’s still a gorgeous machine built with design enthusiasts in mind. That being the case, how does it stack up against other desktop models, specifically the XPS 27 All-in-One?

These performance specs may not necessarily jump off the page, however, when compared to the 4th-gen Intel Core i5 or i7 processor and a 2GB Nvidia GeForce GT750M in the XPS 27, the Surface Studio exists in a separate tier all together. The Surface Studio also touts superior RAM — 32GB opposed to the maximum 16GB in the XPS 27. The Surface Studio is a more capable machine when it comes to performance, even if it’s still utilizing last-gen hardware. Graphic designers and other creative types should have little trouble with their projects. Display The new Surface Studio incorporates a crisp, 28-inch Pixel Sense touch display. With 4,500 x 3,000-pixel resolution and 192 pixels per inch, images should be more vivid and vibrant than anything on the XPS 27. The smaller, 27-inch IPS LED touch display on the latter machine touts a mere 2,560 x 1,440-pixel resolution and 109 ppi, which makes it look dated in comparison. Moreover, the Surface Studio can also instantly switch colors spaces with a simple toggle in the notification pane, something that will surely appeal to photographers and graphic artists alike. The XPS 27 offers no such feature. Design The Surface Studio uses an innovative “Zero Gravity Hinge,” allowing users to effortlessly switch the device from the upright Desktop Mode into a Studio Mode that renders the device nearly flat. When positioned in Studio Mode, the device locks into place at a 20-degree angle for a more natural, hands-on drafting experience. This allows designers to use the Surface Pen and the new Surface Dial more organically. That brings us to one of the key features of the Surface Studio unveiling: the Surface Dial. The Surface Dial looks like a a rather innocuous matte puck. However, the tool is actually a touch-sensitive wireless dial you can place on your display or desk, letting you scroll through and adjust an amalgam of settings with a simple rotation. In preliminary demos, Microsoft showcased the ability to use the Surface Dial directly on the screen in conjunction with several design apps, which allowed the user to tweak color palettes, line thickness, a host of other image facets. With a thick, boxy exterior and hulking plastic accents, the overall design of the XPS 27 is less to behold than that of the Surface Studio. Similarly, the XPS 27 may be less useful to graphic designers than the Surface Studio, but the XPS 27 is still quite capable for other tasks. There’s no sexy hinge, nor will you be able to “dial-in” so to speak, but the XPS 27 still utilizes the touch-enabled display to its advantage. Availability and pricing The base-model of the Surface Studio starts at $2,999, and comes with a Core i5 processor, GTX 965M, 8GB RAM, and a 1TB hard drive. An additional $500 will allow you to upgrade to a Core i7 CPU and 16GB of RAM. The top-of -the-line model includes a GTX 980M, 32GB RAM, and a 2TB hard drive for $4,199. You can pre-order the Surface Studio now, but it won’t ship until December 15. With the XPS 27, a modest $2,299 will net you the top-of-the-line Dell XPS 27 Touch model, which comes with a 4th-gen  i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, and a 2TB hard drive for $2,299. Conclusion Until the unveiling of the Surface Studio, Microsoft had decided to only focus its “Surface” revolution on tablet options. The Surface Studio, however, looks to merge the desktop with the company’s existing lineup of Surface products. We could be looking at an epic clash of titans down the road as Microsoft appears to take aim at the iMac with this unique, desktop conversion. When it comes to the comparison between the Surface Studio and the XPS 27, though, it’s almost more of a juxtaposition rather than a fair technological comparison. The Surface Studio is simply a more versatile, powerful product, one that showcases a sleek, modern design that’s nothing short of gorgeous. The Dell XPS 27 is less expensive, sure, but it’s nowhere near as capable. Also watch: Dell Venue 10 7000 Series – Hands on Review Please enable Javascript to watch this video

In short, Apple hasn’t given its professional laptop lineup a real overhaul in some time. Only the smaller 13” model ever got Intel’s 5th gen Broadwell CPU – the 15” model is even further back, on 4th gen Haswell – and otherwise the laptops haven’t had major feature updates since 2013. As a result, Apple has been due as anyone can be to update their laptops. And at a special event held at their campus this morning, they have done just that, launching the 4th generation of the MacBook Pro. For better or worse the new 4th generation family doesn’t have a catchy name like Retina to help set it apart from the prior models. But make no mistake, Apple has been busy on giving their languishing laptops a much-needed facelift. All-told, Apple has introduced 3 new MacBook Pro models: a basic 13” version, and then two full-featured versions at 13” and 15” respectively. All three models are form the same mold, so to speak. All of them get the same new unibody design, the same wide color gamut (P3) display, and the same upgraded internal hardware composed of Intel’s 6th generation Skylake CPUs, Thunderbolt 3, and new SSDs. What separates the basic 13” from the other two models, besides cost, is that it doesn’t include Apple’s new multi-touch Touch Bar (more on this in a sec). 4th Gen MacBook Pro Lineup Model 2015 15" 2016 13" (basic) 2016 13" (touch) 2016 15" Dimensions 1.8 cm x 35.89 cm x 24.71 cm 1.49 cm x 30.41 cm x 21.24 cm 1.55 cm x 34.93 cm x 24.07 cm Weight 4.49 lbs (2.04 kg) 3.02 lbs (1.37 kg) 4.02 lbs (1.83 kg) CPU 2.2GHz Core i7-4770HQ (Haswell) 2.0GHz Core i5-6360U (Skylake) 2.9GHz Core i5-6267U (Skylake) 2.6GHz Core i7-6700HQ (Skylake) GPU Intel Iris Pro 5200 Intel Iris Graphics 540 Intel Iris Graphics 550 Intel HD Graphics 530 + AMD Radeon Pro 450 (2GB) Display 15" 2880 x 1800 IPS LCD sRGB Gamut 13" 2560 x 1600 IPS LCD P3 Gamut 15" 2880 x 1800 IPS LCD P3 Gamut Memory 16GB DDR3L-1600 8GB LPDDR3-1866 8GB LPDDR3-2133 16GB LPDDR3-2133 SSD 256GB PCIe SSD (PCIe x2) 256GB PCIe SSD Touch Bar No No Yes I/O 2x Thunderbolt 2 (supports DP1.2), 1x HDMI 1.4, 2x USB 3.0 (Type-A), 3.5mm Audio, SDXC Slot 2x Thunderbolt 3 (supports DP1.2 & USB 3.1 Gen 2 modes), 3.5mm Audio 4x Thunderbolt 3 (supports DP1.2 & USB 3.1 Gen 2 modes), 3.5mm Audio Battery Capacity 99.5 Wh 54.5 Wh 49.2 Wh 76 Wh Battery Life 9 Hours 10 Hours Price $1999 $1499 $1799 $2399 If you’ve been watching Apple over the years, then you know that the company has a (sometimes unhealthy) obsession with reducing their products’ thickness, and the 4th gen MacBook Pro follows that obsession to a T. The new family of laptops is thinner than ever, with Apple taking them from 18mm to 14.9mm and 15.5mm for the 13” and 15” models respectively. Altogether, the total volume is down 23% for the 13” model and 20% for the 15” model. Apple is still using their now tried-and-true aluminum unibody design for the family, so if you’re familiar with the current color-coated MacBook, then you know what to expect here. Though the event was very brief on how Apple was able to shave off so much volume compared to the last generation, it sounds like they’ve gone with a thinner cooling system, and in the case of the 15” model, AMD’s low-profile Polaris 11 GPU. Under the hood, this change in volume comes without a significant change in official TDPs (so all factors held equal, Apple would be removing the same amount of heat in a thinner design). Apple has finally made the jump across the entire family to Intel’s 14nm Skylake processors. The basic 13” model uses a 15W CPU, the higher-end 13” model uses a 28W CPU, and the 15” model uses a 45W CPU, the latter two being the same TDPs as the last generation. Apple isn’t talking up CPU performance too much here, but given how long they’ve been on Haswell on the 15” model in particular, we should see a good performance bump. Meanwhile, in a change from the 3rd generation design, all 15” 4th gen MacBook Pros come with discrete Radeon Pro graphics. Apple has tapped AMD’s new Polaris 11 GPU, in part for the low z-height it offers, which replaces the 4 year old Cape Verde GPU in the previous MacBook Pro. Apple is offering 3 dGPU configurations at increasingly higher performance. From what AMD has told me, these chips are all in the ballpark of 35W. Relative to the previous dGPU models – or even more, the previous model that only offered an integrated Intel GPU – GPU performance should be greatly improved over the last generation. Over 2x for the top-tier Radeon Pro 460 is a very reasonable assumption right now, though one that testing will need to confirm. On the SSD side of matters, Apple has quickly talked up the fact that the new MacBook Pros use a new SSD. Apple traditionally uses multiple vendors, but the quoted 3GB/sec read speeds are consistent with the latest generation of drives out of Samsung and Toshiba. So is the fact that Apple is now offering SSDs up to 2TB in size. More visible is the change to the display. Apple hasn’t increased their resolutions at all – so these are the same 2880x1800 & 2560x1600 resolution configurations at before – but they have upgraded what these displays can do. All of the MacBook Pros now support the wider P3 color gamut that Apple has been championing for the last year and already offers on the iMac, iPhone 7, and iPad Pro. Meaning that the new laptops now support a wider color gamut and can display material mastered for P3 (or photos taken from the iPhone 7) at their full gamut. The new displays are also said to be quite a bit brighter than before; Apple is throwing around 500 nits, or 67% brighter. And, perhaps most interestingly, Apple has confirmed that the new displays support “variable refresh rate” technology. I need to dig into this more, but if this is an implementation of AMD’s FreeSync tech or something similar, then it would potentially be a nice improvement in perceived screen smoothness.  Apple’s also touting that the new display consumes 30% less power, but it’s not clear how much of that is due to variable (e.g. lower) refresh rates and how much of that is from panel and backlighting improvements. Apple has also reworked the keyboard and trackpad, in part to integrate the latest technologies and to achieve their thinness goals. The new MacBook Pros utilize a newer revision of the butterfly switch first introduced on the MacBook keyboard. This means we’re talking about a shorter travel distance than the prior generation MacBook Pros – something that may not be popular in all corners – but at the same time we’re told that these aren’t the same identical switches as on the MacBook, and that there have been some changes to improve the feel. Meanwhile the Force Touch trackpad has been enlarged; it now goes from the bottom edge of the laptop to the keyboard, the full area that Apple could hope to give it.  This is a 100% area increase for the 15” model, and a 46% increase for the 13” model. Apple has also overhauled their input/output options on the new MacBook Pros; quite radically in fact. Apple has doubled-down on Thunderbolt 3/USB Type-C. All three models contain solely either 2 (13” basic) or 4 (all other models) TB3 ports (which also double as USB-C 3.1 Gen 2 ports), and then a 3.5mm audio jack. This means the MagSafe port is gone, as are the USB Type-A ports and the Thunderbolt 2 ports. In this sense it’s very close to what has happened with the MacBook, except the MacBook Pro gets a larger number of ports. TB3 is enabled through the use of Intel’s Alpine Ridge controller; the 2 port versions have a single controller, and the 4 port versions have 2 controllers (since Intel doesn’t make a 4 port version). Furthermore all 2 or 4 ports can be used for charging or display outputs as necessary, so they are all equals in functionality. Last, but certainly not least however, is perhaps the marquee feature of the 4th generation MacBook Pros: the Touch Bar. A bit of a poorly kept secret in the run-up to today’s launch, the Touch Bar is a (presumably OLED) capacitive multi-touch display that replaces the row previously occupied by the function keys.  The idea, in a nutshell, is to make a dynamic row of virtual buttons that can be whatever an application (or user) needs them to be, bringing with it all of the advantages of multi-touch that Apple has developed over the years for their iOS devices. Note that the Touch Bar is only available on the higher-end MacBook Pros; the basic 13” model forgoes the Touch Bar in favor of a traditional row of function keys, presumably for cost reasons. Rounding out the feature set, the Touch Bar also includes a Touch ID fingerprint sensor on its right side, and the necessary controller – what Apple calls the T1 – to handle Touch ID and the Secure Enclave duties. This sensor means that virtually everything that can be done with Touch ID on iOS devices can be extended to macOS: one-touch login, Apple Pay confirmation, etc. You can even use it to do things iOS can’t do, such as swap between users. Taking a page from those iOS devices, the Touch ID sensor is the one physical button that’s part of the Touch Bar; it is both a fingerprint scanner and the device’s physical power button. Judging from the presentation alone, the Touch Bar is going to be divisive among users. Replacing physical buttons with a capacitive strip is a major change; if you’re used to feeling buttons, there’s nothing here to feel. On the other hand, Apple is convinced that the function keys are underutilized right now, and that space can be put to better use. Even with the track pad already offering Force Touch, the Touch Bar has the advantage of being able to display what button it is, and behave separately from the trackpad. As someone who admittedly is still old school enough to configure the function keys to work as actual function keys – and not the screen/sound/playback controls Apple defaults to – I’m definitely going to have to sit down with the new Touch Bar to get an idea of what the transition is like. It’s a bold idea for Apple; but bold ideas can be both good and bad. Wrapping things up, the new MacBook Pros are available for order today. The basic 13” model (the one without the Touch Bar and only 2 TB3 ports) will retail for $1499 and is shipping immediately. The other two models will be at $1799 and $2399 for the 13” and 15” models respectively, and will not be shipping for another 2-3 weeks. Finally, Apple has also illustrated how the overall MacBook family of laptops is organized now that they’ve added the new MacBook Pros. The 11” MacBook Air has been removed from sale entirely, while the 13” model is still for sale, but hasn’t received any update. Given that the new MacBook Pros are thinner than the MacBook Air 13”, it seems likely that it’s going to eventually be phased out entirely. Consequently the new, modern MacBook lineup consists of 4 laptops: the 12” MacBook, the basic 13” MacBook Pro, the advanced 13” MacBook Pro, and the 15” MacBook Pro.

Wonder how battery life is going to be affected by that. Also damn they jacked up the prices... Reply Morawka - Thursday, October 27, 2016 - link the pro's always used a 28w cpu, i'm not sure why anandtech thinks otherwise. IIRC the 15w CPU's were only used in the Macbook Air Reply Morawka - Thursday, October 27, 2016 - link the 13" pro mind you, or course the 15" got a 45W CPU.. although my current rMBP is using a 45w CPU and a 100W GPU. They cut the GPU TDP quite a bit from when they used Nvidia. I really wish they would start using Nvidia again and quit signing these contracts with AMD that tie their hands for 3-5 years. after all, nobody beats Nvidia at Perf per watt in mobile GPU's Reply arayoflight - Friday, October 28, 2016 - link A bigger advantage of Nvidia GPUs will be CUDA. Most applications or libraries don't support OpenCL. Reply Stuka87 - Friday, October 28, 2016 - link CUDA is almost unheard of in the Mac world. OSX itself uses OpenCL, as do all of Apples Pro apps. The fact that nVidia doesnt support the latest OpenCL is one of the reasons they have not been used for a few years now. Reply Polacott - Friday, October 28, 2016 - link Apple uses OpenCL as is an open standard, wisely they won't tie to a proprietary api that is supported and owned by only by one manufacturer. I really wonder how CUDA reach so far in time. Reply ImSpartacus - Saturday, October 29, 2016 - link Nvidia has a ton of marketshare and pretty tremendous mindshare. It's one of the reasons that I'm still nervous about getting a vrr monitor because I'm not convinced that freesync will be the "winner" just because it's in an official standard. Nvidia has shown that they can play by their own rules and still "win". Reply Azix - Friday, October 28, 2016 - link Apple favors openCL and CUDA should be able to run on AMD GPUs soon enough. Reply jameskatt - Sunday, October 30, 2016 - link Apple prefers developers use Metal - it's own proprietary graphics standard. Metal is much faster than OpenCL. And Metal runs in iOS, MacOS, and TVOS. OpenCL is the backup. Reply Polacott - Friday, October 28, 2016 - link CUDA is a proprietary api owned by Nvidia on the other hand OpenCL is an open standard that in the begining was created by Apple, IBM, AMD, Intel and Nvidia. Adobe for instance uses OpenCL to accelerate processing operations. So, OpenCL is future proof. "Most applications or libraries don't support OpenCL" do you have any data to support such a thing? Think a bit instead of just incorporating pure NVidia corporate bs.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Hours before the new MacBook's are Introduced, Apple's UK Trademark Filing for 'Touch Bar' Surfaces | Main | Apple Executives Continue to Hold the Philosophy that Touch Screens Aren't Right, but Not Everyone Agrees » October 27, 2016 Today's Apple Event Focused on the All-New 'Touch Bar' for MacBook Pro   Just before the Apple Event started we posted a report on Apple's official trademark filing for 'Touch Bar' that surfaced in the UK. Apple began the keynote telling us that it was the twenty-fifth anniversary of Apple's notebooks. They rifled through the breakthroughs for their notebooks over the years which led to today's big breakthrough feature called the Touch Bar. Apple's new mid to high-end MacBook Pro's will include the new contextual 'Touch Bar' that replacing the traditional F-Keys bar. Every time you open an Apple app such as Mail, Safari, Photos, Keynote or Final Cut Pro, the Touch Bar controls will automatically change to give you a faster way to work. It's a whole new productivity tool that truly adds a new dimension to the MacBook Pro. The new Touch Bar also introduces Touch ID for the MacBook, a feature that we covered in a patent report back in 2015. The new MacBook Pro also introduced an updated keyboard with second generation butterfly keys. Whether this fully matches Apple's latest patent features isn't known at this time, but the patent was discussing the next generation of butterfly keys. The actual Touch Bar was covered in a report in August pointing to a patent going back to 2012. Lastly, the MacBook Pro's high-end model does indeed include an AMD graphics card based on the Polaris Architecture as we reported on back in April. You could find more about Apple's new MacBook specifications here and about the new individual features here.       And what would an Apple Event be without a new Jony Ive video?     It must be said that most analysts and major Apple blogs were hoping for a lot more at this event. The big miss was without a doubt an iMac refresh going into the all-important holiday season. Others were expecting the Mac Pro to be updated and an all new standalone display to replace their defunct Thunderbolt model.   Yet the rest of the Mac line-up is likely to be refreshed in the first half of 2017. In September we posted a report titled "Future iMacs Supporting Intel's 7th Gen Core will usher in Immersive Internet Era." In that report we pointed to Intel's Navin Shenoy, VP, GM Client Computing Group who clearly pointed out that the new Seventh-Gen Core processors for desktops were only coming to market in early 2017. So technically the delay in updating the iMac is squarely on Intel for dropping the ball. Most people purchase major ticket computers at Christmas, so what were they thinking?   Yet with that said, Apple could have presented a 'sneak peek' of the next-gen iMac and tell us that it would be launching sometime in March or April (or whenever). There's nothing like a great movie trailer to pump up an audience prior to a movie debuting at a later time and Apple could have done that here.   Of course all die-hard Apple fans will patiently wait to upgrade their iMac and/or Mac Pro in 2017 without blinking. But those who are able to run macOS and Windows 10 fluently, there are certainly more choices out there than ever before if your system is on its last legs.    Yesterday Microsoft introduced their all-new 'Surface Studio' desktop aimed at Pro creatives like animators and graphic artists. The system's hot 28" PixelSense Display offers 63% more pixels than a 4K television. They also introduced the 'Surface Dial' which is a new tool for artists that is generated a lot of buzz in the press. Amazingly for an all-in-one design they were able to jam it with a whopping 32GB RAM. Yet without a doubt Microsoft's first generation of Surface Studio is aiming squarely at the higher-end creative community, a market which has traditionally been a stronghold for Apple. It's a market that won't blink at the US$3000 starting price.    For the mid-range (AIO) All-In-One Computer, HP reinvented their desktop systems so that the brains of the computer now resides at the base of the display so that the displays could be lighter and much, much thinner. One of the features that many will appreciate is their all-new pop-up camera and microphone. When a user needs to start their Windows system in the morning using their biometrics system associated with 'Hello Windows' or when holding a video conference, the user taps the top of the display and the camera and microphone pops-up. When not needed it tucks back into the display. This way there's no need for user's taping over the camera for fear of snoopers. The new HP (AIO) desktops are also priced for mainstream wallets. See the video below that focuses on the new HP Envy features.     So over this holiday season, the iMac will have a lot of competition aimed at the general consumer who doesn't particularly care about the operating system for simply writing the odd Word report, be on social media or play games.   Considering that Apple just came off its weakest year in over a decade, I was surprised at how little was refreshed today. Apple is such a huge company with so many engineering teams and to have only updated their MacBook Pro line-up was baffling.   Then again, if you happen to be ready to upgrade your MacBook Pro, then today was certainly a great day with Apple putting all of their weight behind a dozen or more refinements to make this MacBook Pro upgrade a great buy for the holidays.   At the end of the day, did today's Apple Event live up to your expectations?

The Bad You're paying a hefty premium for the Touch Bar, which supports only a limited handful of Apple apps for now. The USB-C-only ports mean carrying a bag full of dongles. The lack of high-end graphics or huge RAM options in the 13-inch model may frustrate photo and video professionals. The Bottom Line Apple's smart, useful Touch Bar makes it well worth splurging on the step-up version of the streamlined 13-inch MacBook Pro. 8.6 Overall Design 9.0 Features 8.0 Performance 8.0 Battery 9.0 Review Sections Review Prices Specifications User Reviews facebook twitter more more + comments 0 pinterest googleplus email tumblr stumble reddit linkedin digg CNET Computers Laptops Apple MacBook Pro with Touch Bar (13-inch, 2016) Apple's taking big swings with the new MacBook Pro. Some land square, some miss their mark. Altogether, this is a beautiful, powerful machine that almost everyone will want, but consider the trade-offs carefully. This MacBook Pro is thinner and lighter than its predecessor, with a flattened keyboard and expanded touchpad. It has a newer selection of Intel processors, faster flash storage and a brighter Retina screen. The new MacBook Pro has also dropped all its legacy ports for Thunderbolt 3-powered USB-C -- a controversial move that requires you to buy a truckload of dongles, but also a move that many high-end Windows laptops are following. Apple even threw in the pleasing and very useful TouchID fingerprint sensor, imported almost whole-hog from the iPhone and iPad. But you know all that already. What you really want to learn about is the new MacBook Pro's headline feature: the Touch Bar, a tiny 1cm tall touchscreen that replaces the function key row on the top of new Pro's keyboard, and also jacks up the price for this high-end machine. View full gallery Sarah Tew/CNET We've already extensively covered the basics on the new 13- and 15-inch Pros, which were unveiled at Apple's headquarters on October 27 and are available for sale as of early November. That includes our exclusive early hands-on with the new MacBook Pro, as well as our review of the entry-level 2016 MacBook Pro model (which keeps its traditional function key row, and doesn't include TouchID). Start with both of those stories if you want an exhaustive overview of the design changes, component upgrades and port-related compromises of this MacBook Pro -- which is essentially the 10th anniversary edition of the original 2006 MacBook Pro. More on the MacBook Pro Apple's amazing strip show reinvents the laptop keyboard Apple MacBook Pro (no Touch Bar) review: The Retina MacBook Air you've always wanted Does the Mac still matter? Jony Ive talks about putting the Apple 'touch' on the MacBook Pro The Mac and iPad aren't merging. Get over it Here, however, we're focusing on that Touch Bar. How does it work? Is it useful? Can it replace the iPad-like touchscreen Mac we're not likely to get in the foreseeable future, according to our recent exclusive interviews with Apple execs? View full gallery The new MacBook Pro (on the left) is thinner than the previous design. Sarah Tew/CNET I've lived with the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar for almost two weeks. Here's what I learned. A tiny slice of iPad on your MacBook The Touch Bar is a long, skinny OLED touchscreen that sits above the keyboard, replacing the traditional F1-F12 keys, as well as the escape key and power button. On the far right end of the Touch Bar is a fingerprint reader, similar to the one found on the iPhone, which enables Touch ID and Apple Pay for secure system log-ins and online payments. By default, the Touch Bar displays system tools, including screen brightness and volume control. But when using select apps (for now mostly Apple-created apps such as Safari, but more third-party support is on the way), new contextual commands appear on the Touch Bar, and the system tools roll up into a condensed version on the right side of the strip. You can still access volume and brightness controls, but to get the full default list of commands back, you'll have to tap on a small arrow to expand it (which also hides the contextual commands for the app you're currently using). View full gallery Sarah Tew/CNET Having spent some serious hands-on time with the Touch Bar version of the new 13-inch MacBook Pro, and testing its capabilities with a wide range of apps, it feels like a tool that can enhance your computing experience, but won't revolutionize it. It does less than a full touchscreen might, but Apple has found a way to use it to cut down on keystrokes, streamline tasks and add additional levels of fine control. I almost immediately started find little things it did better than traditional keyboard and touchpad input Some who've seen the Touch Bar only from afar call it a gimmick, but I almost immediately started finding little things it did better than traditional keyboard and touchpad input, and after a very short time I was using a handful of these Touch Bar functions instinctively, without even thinking about it. If you spend a bit of time trying it out in different apps, you'll end up with maybe a half-dozen or so shortcuts you love the Touch Bar for, while your computing experience remains otherwise unchanged. That makes it harder to justify as an expensive add-on to the new MacBook Pro line. The least expensive Touch Bar system is the one reviewed here, at $1,799 (£1,749 or AU$2,699). That's a $300 jump over the more mainstream $1,499 entry level MacBook Pro (£1,449 or AU$2,199), which lacks the Touch Bar. But in addition to the Touch Bar, this version also has a faster processor (a 2.9GHz Intel Core i5, versus a 2.0GHz Core i5), marginally better integrated Intel graphics (Iris 550 versus Iris 540), and it doubles the number of included USB-C Thunderbolt ports to four. So at least you're getting more for your $300 than just the Touch Bar. View full gallery The new MacBook Pro has a shallower butterfly keyboard. Sarah Tew/CNET Previously, the entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro cost $1,299 (£1,249 or AU$1,999), but that model had half the storage of these new ones, only 128GB. Note that if you're kicking yourself for missing out on the older Pro (which was excellent in its own right), with its lower starting price and wider variety of ports, Apple is still selling a single 13-inch and single 15-inch 2015-era configuration, at least for now. Apple MacBook Pro with Touch Bar (13-inch) Price as reviewed $1,799, £1,749 or AU$2,699 Display size/resolution 13.3-inch 2,560 x 1,600 PC CPU 2.9GHz Intel Core i5 PC Memory 8GB 1866MHz LPDDR3 Graphics Intel Iris Graphics 550 Storage 256GB PCIe SSD Networking 802.11ac wireless, Bluetooth 4.2 Operating system macOS Sierra One bar, many versions The Touch Bar is is filled with possibilities, but like the branching menus within menus it's supposed to replace, some of its functions can remain buried under additional taps and swipes, depending on which apps you use it with. There's only so much one can fit into a 2,170x60 display. Actual instructions for how to use the Touch Bar are sparse. Instead, it's up to you to eyeball the new buttons that pop up contextually in each supported application and figure out how to use them. In most cases, it's presented logically, but some on-screen buttons have layers within them, and navigating deeper in and then moving back out isn't always intuitive (as in the case of Photos, Apple's photo organizing and tweaking app). In other cases, the Touch Bar buttons are a perfect distillation of the most important functions in an app (such as Safari or Messages), and easy to pick up and use immeidately. View full gallery Sarah Tew/CNET Each Touch Bar series of commands has its own visual and organizational language. That's easy enough to translate when only Apple-created programs are supported, but we'll have to wait and see how other software makers handle the Touch Bar. Windows PC makers have struggled for years with how to properly present proprietary software interfaces, asking consumers to learn and relearn new behaviors for apps they may already be familiar with, or for programs and features that may disappear or change radically in the next version. Adobe is one company you really want to watch in this space. A key partner for Touch Bar support, Photoshop will add Touch Bar controls later this year. It'll be very interesting to see what they do, and if long-time Photoshop users take to it. That's especially important because Adobe is a master of extreme usability and platform continuity. (As an example, I took a single-semester Photoshop tutorial course as a college undergrad way back in the 1990s. All these years later, and through countless versions of Photoshop, and I can still sit down in front of the latest iteration of the software and have a basic idea of what I'm doing.) View full gallery Sarah Tew/CNET Microsoft has also pledged to add Touch Bar support for Office. But until those companies and others deliver, it's all about Apple's in-house apps, including Mail, Messages, iTunes and Safari. I found the Touch Bar added something useful to each of these, but that's predicated on actually using those apps. If you prefer Spotify to iTunes, or Chrome to Safari, there's not much the Touch Bar can do for you from within those apps, besides the basic system functions previously mapped to the Function key row, such a volume controls. One interesting comparison to make is to Microsoft's new Surface Dial. That physical control knob works on many Windows PCs, but is specifically designed with the Surface Studio desktop in mind, and it covers a lot of the same ground as the Touch Bar. Both the Bar and Dial offer easier access to specific menu items in select apps. Like the Touch Bar, the Dial provides basic system functions, including volume controls, when not in a supported app. Both are very early in their development, and both call out for wider app support (neither has a Photoshop-specific set of controls yet). For illustrators and animators, I can see the real appeal of the Surface Dial and its big, analog-feeling wheel. For more efficient general computing, so far I find that Apple's Touch Bar is the more immediately useful of the two ideas. First steps The initial thing you'll want to do with the Touch Bar is set up Touch ID. That uses Apple's custom T1 security chip, which is built into the system, and the fingerprint reader that sits on the far right side of the Touch Bar. Setup is similar to an iPhone, with repeated fingertaps on the sensor recording fingerprint data. Unlike an iPhone and iPad, Macs support multiple user profiles, so each person using the machine can set up fingerprint access to their profile. View full gallery Sarah Tew/CNET User switching via fingerprint is especially impressive, and nearly instantaneous. I set up a "CNET" profile linked to one finger and a personal profile linked to a different finger. Just by placing each finger in turn on the Touch ID and clicking down (it's both a fingerprint sensor and a physical button), the profiles switched on the fly. After setting up the fingerprint access, which can also be used for Apple Pay purchases from supported merchants, you might also want to change the default lineup of buttons available on the Touch Bar. That menu is a little hard to find, tucked away in System Preferences under Keyboard > Customize Control Strip (oddly, it's called Control Strip here, and not Touch Bar). View full gallery Sarah Tew/CNET From that menu, new buttons can be dragged down to the bottom of the screen, where they'll appear on the Touch Bar, and from there, can be moved left and right. For example, I swapped out the Launch Pad button for a Show Desktop button. The default setup is the logical choice for most, but customization options are always welcome. Here's how the Touch Bar works in a few key apps: Continue to next page 01 02 Best laptops of 2016 See All Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga (OLED) Starting at: $1,682.10 4.5 stars This professional version of Lenovo's Yoga hybrid is expensive, but packs in plenty of...

Things are slightly complicated here because there are two completely different versions of the 13-inch MacBook Pro: A base model and a top-end device with Apple’s funky new Touchbar, more powerful processors and more ports. Watch: 13-inch MacBook Pro video review Related: Best laptop Full specification comparison (Based on Dell.com and Apple.com. Other retailers may vary. A previous version of this article incorrectly listed the XPS 13 as topping out at 8GB and 256GB SSD) Device Dell XPS 13 Base MacBook Pro 13 Top MacBook Pro 13 Weight 1.2kg 1.37kg 1.37kg Dimensions W: 304mm D: 200mm H: 15mm W: 304mm D: 212mm H: 15mm W: 304mm D: 212mm H: 15mm Processor choices 7th Gen Intel Core i5 and i7 6th Gen Intel Core i5 or Core i7 6th Gen Intel Core i5 or Core i7 Graphics Intel HD Graphics 620 Intel Iris Graphics 540 Intel Iris Graphics 550 RAM 8-16GB DDR3 8GB-16GB DDR3 8-16GB DDR3 Storage 128GB-1TBB PCIE SSD 256GB-1TB PCIE SSD 512GB-1TB SSD Screen Full HD to 3,200x1,800 2560x1600 2560x1600 Price £999-£1649 £1449-£2439 £1749-£2759 Design and build One thing that’s mostly the same between the two new MacBooks is the physical design, so this is a good place to start. The Dell XPS 13 wins off the bat in terms of weight, coming in 170g lighter than both 13-inch MacBook Pro models. The MacBook is slightly larger in terms of overall footprint, and side-by-side the Dell looks significantly smaller. Related: 5 things you need to know about the MacBook Pro Rounded up to the nearest millimeter, both the XPS 13 and MacBook are the same thickness. The materials used are different, of course. Apple has continued to use the tried and tested aluminium unibody design, while Dell has a metal body and lid with a wrist rest coated in carbon fibre. The MacBook is also available in a Space Grey material, like the 12-inch MacBook. The touchpad on the MacBook is substantially bigger than that on the XPS 13, which makes for much more comfortable gestures and swiping. The MacBook also gets Apple's Force Touch tech, which simulates a physical click using haptic feedback and allows for pressure-sensitive interactions. Apple’s Butterfly keyboard design makes a return and has been improved over last year's model. It won't be for everyone, but its a comfortable, accurate and responsive keyboard that's hard to beat. The more expensive 13-inch MacBook gets Apple’s clever Touch bar, which is a feature no other laptop on the planet has. We’ll go into more depth in a separate article, but based on our first impressions it looks incredibly useful. In terms of ports, the MacBook 13-inch gets four USB 3.1/Thunderbolt 3 ports for powering high-end peripherals such as monitors and storage arrays. No adapters are supplied in the box. You can plug the power adapter into any port and charge the device. It also has a 3.5mm headphone jack. Dell gives you two regular USB 3.0 ports along with a USB 3.1/Thunderbolt 3 ports and an SD card reader. Performance This is where things get a little complicated. The cheaper 13-inch MacBook gets a Core i5 processor with a base clock speed of 2GHz, which is less powerful than the 2.5GHz base clock speed on the Dell XPS 13. Both cheapest models boost up to 3.1GHz. Moving up the range, the Dell XPS 13 offers a Core i7 processor with a maximum speed of 3.5GHz. The maximum speed on the top-end Core i7 in the 13-inch MacBook is 3.6GHz, which makes it slightly more powerful, but for a much greater price. Apple has the upper hand in terms of graphics. Intel's Iris brand of graphics is generally much better at 3D work and video playback than regular HD graphics, although we’ll have to run some benchmarks to make proper comparisons here. One thing to note is that the processors available with the Dell XPS 13 are newer, and part of Dell's 7th-gen 'Kaby Lake' line-up. But because Apple normally chooses bespoke Intel chips, direct comparisons are hard. We've tested the Core i7 XPS 13 and the base model i5 MacBook Pro, with a price difference of £150. Running an identical 3-minute video rendering task in Adobe Premier, the MacBook took seven minutes while the XPS 13 polished it off in a little over five. The difference is significant, and if raw processing performance is priority the XPS 13 is the better choice. All three devices come with a minimum of 8GB of RAM, while the most expensive specification of the MacBook gets a full 16GB. Models higher up the Dell XPS 13 range get 16GB of RAM. The cheapest 13-inch MacBook gets 128GB of PCI-E SSD storage, which is the same as the Dell XPS 13. From there, you can go up to 1TB depending on the model, but this increases the price substantially. The same applies to the Dell XPS 13, the most expensive version of which tops out at 1TB. Buy Now: Dell XPS 13 at Amazon.com from $1,070 Best Deals for Dell XPS 13 9350 Screen The cheapest Dell XPS 13 gets a 1,920x1,080-pixel Full HD display, while all the MacBooks get ‘Retina’ 2,560x1,600 screens. The top-end XPS 13 goes well beyond that with a 3,200x1,800-pixel panel that also gets a glossy touch layer. Pricing and conclusion Dell's XPS 13 starts out cheaper than the MacBook Pro and tops out at £1649 with the top-of-the-range model. The MacBook Pro goes well beyond that as you continue up the range, thanks to the more expensive storage and memory options at the top-end. This is in addition to the more powerful top-end processors that manage higher peak clock speeds than the processor available in the Dell XPS 13. At the bottom end, the XPS 13 is better value, but as you go up the MacBook range and gain access to the Touchbar and higher performance, the MacBook's price premium starts to make more sense. In the base model stakes, the XPS 13 holds the advantage, but we'll wait for our high-end MacBook Pro review before coming to a firm conclusion about the rest of the range.

The Bad You're paying a hefty premium for the Touch Bar, which supports only a limited handful of Apple apps for now. The USB-C-only ports mean carrying a bag full of dongles. The lack of high-end graphics or huge RAM options in the 13-inch model may frustrate photo and video professionals. The Bottom Line Apple's smart, useful Touch Bar makes it well worth splurging on the step-up version of the streamlined 13-inch MacBook Pro. 8.6 Overall Design 9.0 Features 8.0 Performance 8.0 Battery 9.0 Review Sections Review Prices Specifications User Reviews facebook twitter more more + comments 0 pinterest googleplus email tumblr stumble reddit linkedin digg CNET Computers Laptops Apple MacBook Pro with Touch Bar (13-inch, 2016) Apple's taking big swings with the new MacBook Pro. Some land square, some miss their mark. Altogether, this is a beautiful, powerful machine that almost everyone will want, but consider the trade-offs carefully. This MacBook Pro is thinner and lighter than its predecessor, with a flattened keyboard and expanded touchpad. It has a newer selection of Intel processors, faster flash storage and a brighter Retina screen. The new MacBook Pro has also dropped all its legacy ports for Thunderbolt 3-powered USB-C -- a controversial move that requires you to buy a truckload of dongles, but also a move that many high-end Windows laptops are following. Apple even threw in the pleasing and very useful TouchID fingerprint sensor, imported almost whole-hog from the iPhone and iPad. But you know all that already. What you really want to learn about is the new MacBook Pro's headline feature: the Touch Bar, a tiny 1cm tall touchscreen that replaces the function key row on the top of new Pro's keyboard, and also jacks up the price for this high-end machine. View full gallery Sarah Tew/CNET We've already extensively covered the basics on the new 13- and 15-inch Pros, which were unveiled at Apple's headquarters on October 27 and are available for sale as of early November. That includes our exclusive early hands-on with the new MacBook Pro, as well as our review of the entry-level 2016 MacBook Pro model (which keeps its traditional function key row, and doesn't include TouchID). Start with both of those stories if you want an exhaustive overview of the design changes, component upgrades and port-related compromises of this MacBook Pro -- which is essentially the 10th anniversary edition of the original 2006 MacBook Pro. More on the MacBook Pro Apple's amazing strip show reinvents the laptop keyboard Apple MacBook Pro (no Touch Bar) review: The Retina MacBook Air you've always wanted Does the Mac still matter? Jony Ive talks about putting the Apple 'touch' on the MacBook Pro The Mac and iPad aren't merging. Get over it Here, however, we're focusing on that Touch Bar. How does it work? Is it useful? Can it replace the iPad-like touchscreen Mac we're not likely to get in the foreseeable future, according to our recent exclusive interviews with Apple execs? View full gallery The new MacBook Pro (on the left) is thinner than the previous design. Sarah Tew/CNET I've lived with the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar for almost two weeks. Here's what I learned. A tiny slice of iPad on your MacBook The Touch Bar is a long, skinny OLED touchscreen that sits above the keyboard, replacing the traditional F1-F12 keys, as well as the escape key and power button. On the far right end of the Touch Bar is a fingerprint reader, similar to the one found on the iPhone, which enables Touch ID and Apple Pay for secure system log-ins and online payments. By default, the Touch Bar displays system tools, including screen brightness and volume control. But when using select apps (for now mostly Apple-created apps such as Safari, but more third-party support is on the way), new contextual commands appear on the Touch Bar, and the system tools roll up into a condensed version on the right side of the strip. You can still access volume and brightness controls, but to get the full default list of commands back, you'll have to tap on a small arrow to expand it (which also hides the contextual commands for the app you're currently using). View full gallery Sarah Tew/CNET Having spent some serious hands-on time with the Touch Bar version of the new 13-inch MacBook Pro, and testing its capabilities with a wide range of apps, it feels like a tool that can enhance your computing experience, but won't revolutionize it. It does less than a full touchscreen might, but Apple has found a way to use it to cut down on keystrokes, streamline tasks and add additional levels of fine control. I almost immediately started find little things it did better than traditional keyboard and touchpad input Some who've seen the Touch Bar only from afar call it a gimmick, but I almost immediately started finding little things it did better than traditional keyboard and touchpad input, and after a very short time I was using a handful of these Touch Bar functions instinctively, without even thinking about it. If you spend a bit of time trying it out in different apps, you'll end up with maybe a half-dozen or so shortcuts you love the Touch Bar for, while your computing experience remains otherwise unchanged. That makes it harder to justify as an expensive add-on to the new MacBook Pro line. The least expensive Touch Bar system is the one reviewed here, at $1,799 (£1,749 or AU$2,699). That's a $300 jump over the more mainstream $1,499 entry level MacBook Pro (£1,449 or AU$2,199), which lacks the Touch Bar. But in addition to the Touch Bar, this version also has a faster processor (a 2.9GHz Intel Core i5, versus a 2.0GHz Core i5), marginally better integrated Intel graphics (Iris 550 versus Iris 540), and it doubles the number of included USB-C Thunderbolt ports to four. So at least you're getting more for your $300 than just the Touch Bar. View full gallery The new MacBook Pro has a shallower butterfly keyboard. Sarah Tew/CNET Previously, the entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro cost $1,299 (£1,249 or AU$1,999), but that model had half the storage of these new ones, only 128GB. Note that if you're kicking yourself for missing out on the older Pro (which was excellent in its own right), with its lower starting price and wider variety of ports, Apple is still selling a single 13-inch and single 15-inch 2015-era configuration, at least for now. Apple MacBook Pro with Touch Bar (13-inch) Price as reviewed $1,799, £1,749 or AU$2,699 Display size/resolution 13.3-inch 2,560 x 1,600 PC CPU 2.9GHz Intel Core i5 PC Memory 8GB 1866MHz LPDDR3 Graphics Intel Iris Graphics 550 Storage 256GB PCIe SSD Networking 802.11ac wireless, Bluetooth 4.2 Operating system macOS Sierra One bar, many versions The Touch Bar is is filled with possibilities, but like the branching menus within menus it's supposed to replace, some of its functions can remain buried under additional taps and swipes, depending on which apps you use it with. There's only so much one can fit into a 2,170x60 display. Actual instructions for how to use the Touch Bar are sparse. Instead, it's up to you to eyeball the new buttons that pop up contextually in each supported application and figure out how to use them. In most cases, it's presented logically, but some on-screen buttons have layers within them, and navigating deeper in and then moving back out isn't always intuitive (as in the case of Photos, Apple's photo organizing and tweaking app). In other cases, the Touch Bar buttons are a perfect distillation of the most important functions in an app (such as Safari or Messages), and easy to pick up and use immeidately. View full gallery Sarah Tew/CNET Each Touch Bar series of commands has its own visual and organizational language. That's easy enough to translate when only Apple-created programs are supported, but we'll have to wait and see how other software makers handle the Touch Bar. Windows PC makers have struggled for years with how to properly present proprietary software interfaces, asking consumers to learn and relearn new behaviors for apps they may already be familiar with, or for programs and features that may disappear or change radically in the next version. Adobe is one company you really want to watch in this space. A key partner for Touch Bar support, Photoshop will add Touch Bar controls later this year. It'll be very interesting to see what they do, and if long-time Photoshop users take to it. That's especially important because Adobe is a master of extreme usability and platform continuity. (As an example, I took a single-semester Photoshop tutorial course as a college undergrad way back in the 1990s. All these years later, and through countless versions of Photoshop, and I can still sit down in front of the latest iteration of the software and have a basic idea of what I'm doing.) View full gallery Sarah Tew/CNET Microsoft has also pledged to add Touch Bar support for Office. But until those companies and others deliver, it's all about Apple's in-house apps, including Mail, Messages, iTunes and Safari. I found the Touch Bar added something useful to each of these, but that's predicated on actually using those apps. If you prefer Spotify to iTunes, or Chrome to Safari, there's not much the Touch Bar can do for you from within those apps, besides the basic system functions previously mapped to the Function key row, such a volume controls. One interesting comparison to make is to Microsoft's new Surface Dial. That physical control knob works on many Windows PCs, but is specifically designed with the Surface Studio desktop in mind, and it covers a lot of the same ground as the Touch Bar. Both the Bar and Dial offer easier access to specific menu items in select apps. Like the Touch Bar, the Dial provides basic system functions, including volume controls, when not in a supported app. Both are very early in their development, and both call out for wider app support (neither has a Photoshop-specific set of controls yet). For illustrators and animators, I can see the real appeal of the Surface Dial and its big, analog-feeling wheel. For more efficient general computing, so far I find that Apple's Touch Bar is the more immediately useful of the two ideas. First steps The initial thing you'll want to do with the Touch Bar is set up Touch ID. That uses Apple's custom T1 security chip, which is built into the system, and the fingerprint reader that sits on the far right side of the Touch Bar. Setup is similar to an iPhone, with repeated fingertaps on the sensor recording fingerprint data. Unlike an iPhone and iPad, Macs support multiple user profiles, so each person using the machine can set up fingerprint access to their profile. View full gallery Sarah Tew/CNET User switching via fingerprint is especially impressive, and nearly instantaneous. I set up a "CNET" profile linked to one finger and a personal profile linked to a different finger. Just by placing each finger in turn on the Touch ID and clicking down (it's both a fingerprint sensor and a physical button), the profiles switched on the fly. After setting up the fingerprint access, which can also be used for Apple Pay purchases from supported merchants, you might also want to change the default lineup of buttons available on the Touch Bar. That menu is a little hard to find, tucked away in System Preferences under Keyboard > Customize Control Strip (oddly, it's called Control Strip here, and not Touch Bar). View full gallery Sarah Tew/CNET From that menu, new buttons can be dragged down to the bottom of the screen, where they'll appear on the Touch Bar, and from there, can be moved left and right. For example, I swapped out the Launch Pad button for a Show Desktop button. The default setup is the logical choice for most, but customization options are always welcome.

The E3900 family of three chips is an update to the E3800 from 2013 and, according to the VP of Intel's Internet of Things Group, Ken Caviasca, has been built "from the ground up" in order to fit with modern IoT needs. Caviasca described the new chip family as a "very targeted product" and one that has been carefully designed to fit with the unique needs of the IoT market. In practical terms that means that the E3900 has focused on several aspects: massive scalability, interoperability and security. Perhaps the main feature of IoT is the fact that people expect to roll out a very large number of sensors and have them both share data and make sense of that data. As such, the E3900 has been designed to sit in both devices and gateways. Caviasca is also proud of the chip's "time coordinated computing" or TCC, which will enable different machines/sensors to work together very precisely – such as on a production line. Due to the fact that the market is "not static" – code for wildly unpredictable – the chips are also highly programmable and allow for individual sensor configuration. And, in line with everyone's fears about IoT, security has been beefed up to ensure that products with Intel chips don't become the next monster botnet. The E3900 is focused squarely on the industrial market with Caviasca highlighting three main sectors that Intel will target: automotive, industrial and video. Which means imaging in autonomous cars, cameras and production lines, and IP cameras/network video recorders. The chips support Ultra HD/4K video at 60Hz. Among the security features come intelligent features like a measured boot time: if your device takes longer than normal to boot up, the system flags it up as potentially compromised. It also includes a range of security specs, from video copy prevention HDCP2.2, to the new TPM 2.0 spec for secure cryptoprocessors, to a number of specs added "because customers asked us to." The E3900 family comprises the E3930, 40 and 50 – you can read the full specs on the Intel factsheet. It can handle temperatures from -40 to 85 degrees Celsius (-40 to 185 Farenheit). The chips are slightly larger than the current E3800, but offer 1.7x computing performance and 2.9x graphics performance over it. They will ship in Q1 next year. Intel hasn't released pricing but it will be "mid-to-high-end," according to Caviasca. He predicts the product life of the chip to be around three years, but with them deployed for up to 10 years. ® Sponsored: Transforming software delivery with DevOps Tips and corrections 20 Comments More from The Register Yeah, that '50bn IoT devices by 2020' claim is a load of dog toffee IDTechX report takes a swipe at other analysts' 'hype bubble' 28 Comments Dell bundles bundle of systems-bundlers into its IoT van Secure or not, it's great if someone's making money Building IoT London: Still working on your pitch?

Britta O'Boyle27 October 2016Laptops Microsoft Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Microsoft announced a couple of new devices to its mobile computing portfolio in 2015 with the launch of the Surface Pro 4 and the Surface Book. One year on and a new device has joined the party in the form of the Surface Book with Performance Base, on sale from the middle of November. The Surface Pro 4 is a tablet with the potential for a keyboard attachment while the Surface Books are laptops with detachable keyboards. Despite sounding like similar devices taking different angles, they aren't, and they will appeal to different people. To help you work out which one might be the right one for you, here is how the new Microsoft Surface Book with Performance Base, or Surface Book i7, compares to last year's Surface Book and the Surface Pro 4. Microsoft Surface Book with Performance Base preview Microsoft Surface Book (2016) vs Surface Book (2015) vs Surface Pro 4: Design Surface Pro 4 is significantly lighter than Surface Books Surface Books offer fully-fledged keyboard Surface Pro 4 about portability, Surface Books about power The Surface Pro 4 features a magnesium case, measures 292.1 x 201.4 x 8.5mm and weighs either 766g or 786g, depending on the configuration. Microsoft claims it is the perfect balance of size and power for working on the go. The Surface Books also feature a magnesium case, but rather than being primarily displays with the option of attaching a keyboard, they are laptops that offer the convenience of detaching the displays should you wish to. Microsoft describes them as the laptop to handle any task. The 2015 model of the Surface Book as a laptop measures 312.3 x 232.1mm with a thickness of 13mm to 22.8mm and it weighs either 1516g or 1576g, depending on the configuration, making it over double the weight of the Surface Pro 4. The 2016 model offers exactly the same measurements as the 2015 model, but the Performance Base element means it is heavier, starting at 1647g.  Both the Surface Books feature something called a Dynamic Fulcrum Hinge, which keeps them balanced at any angle, while the Surface Pro 4 is more about portability. The Surface Pro 4 features a built-in stand so it can prop itself up and a Type Cover can be bought separately providing users with an ultra-thin keyboard with back-lit keys and a large 5-point sensitivity trackpad, but it isn't laptop standard. Both Surface Books on the other hand, feature fully-fledged keyboards that Microsoft describes as "quiet, stable and comfortable". It says this offers best-in-class keystroke. They also feature a trackpad with 10-points of sensitivity. Microsoft Surface Pro 4 review Microsoft Surface Book (2016) vs Surface Book (2015) vs Surface Pro 4: Display Surface Pro 4 has a slightly smaller screen than Surface Books Same display technology and pixel density across all models Surface Pen included with all models The Microsoft Surface Pro 4 has a PixelSense display that the company claims was made to be viewed, touched and written on. It measures 12.3-inches and it features a 2736 x 1824 resolution, which equates to 5 million pixels and a pixel density of 267ppi. The Surface Books have larger displays than the Surface Pro 4 with 13.5-inch screens featuring 3000 x 2000 pixel resolutions for the same pixel density of 267ppi. The Surface Books are in a 3:2 aspect ratio and use Microsoft's PixelSense display technology too so again, they have been made for viewing, touching and writing on. Ultimately, the display experience of the Surface Pro 4 and the Surface Books will be the same, aside from a little extra space on the Surface Books. The Surface Pen that comes with the Surface Pro 4 and the Surface Books has 1024 levels of pressure senstivity, along with an eraser on the other end, allowing users to write and erase on the screens as they would with a traditional pencil. It is attached to the devices magnetically and it offers a full year of use with its battery. Microsoft Surface Book (2015) review Microsoft Surface Book (2016) vs Surface Book (2015) vs Surface Pro 4: Hardware and power Surface Pro 4 has five configuration options as standard, with Intel m3, i5 and i7 models Surface Book (2015) has seven configuration options with option to upgrade GPU Surface Book Performance Base has three configuration options, all of which use i7 Surface Book Performance Base has almost double battery life of Surface Pro 4 The base model of the Surface Pro 4 features the Intel Core m3 processor with Intel HD graphics 515, 128GB SSD and 4GB of RAM. The top end model has the Intel Core i7 chip, Intel Iris graphics, 256GB SSD and 16GB of RAM. There are five configurations available as standard but it's also possible to customise to suit you.  The base model of the 2015 Surface Book has the Intel Core i5 processor, Intel HD graphics, 128GB SSD and 8GB of RAM, while the top model has the Intel Core i7, Nvidia GeForce graphics, 1TB SSD and 16GB of RAM. There are seven configurations available as standard due to the option of upgrading the GPU. The base model of the 2016 Surface Book Performance Base features the Intel Core i7 processor, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 965M 2GB GDDR5 memory, 256GB SSD and 8GB of RAM. There are only three configurations available for this device, with the top model offering the same processor and graphics, but offering double the RAM at 16GB and 1TB SSD. The Surface Books are aimed at all out power users, with the ability to run professional-grade software such as Adobe Creative Cloud and AutoCAD. The Surface Pro 4 on the other hand, will run professional grade apps, but 3D modelling with AutoCAD is restricted to the i7 model, for example. In terms of battery life, the Surface Pro 4 is claimed to offer 9 hours. The 2015 Surface Book bumps this up to 12 hours and the Surface Book with Performance Base offers 16 hours. Microsoft Surface Book 2016 goes super-powerful, increases battery life, amps graphics Microsoft Surface Book (2016) vs Surface Book (2015) vs Surface Pro 4: Connections and ports All models have USB 3.0 Surface Pro 4 has microSD slot, while Surface Books have full-size SD card slot All models run Windows 10 Pro The Microsoft Surface Pro 4 and the Surface Books all feature USB 3.0, but the Surface Books have two ports while the Surface Pro 4 only has the one. The Surface Books also offer a full-size SD card reader, while the Surface Pro 4 only features a microSD card reader. All three have a Mini DisplayPort, headphone jack and a power connector though. They also all run on Windows 10 Pro and offer a 30-day Office 365 30-day trial. Microsoft Surface Book (2016) vs Surface Book (2015) vs Surface Pro 4: Price Surface Pro 4 cheapest starting price Surface Book Performance Base most expensive, as you'd expect The Microsoft Surface Pro 4 starts at £749 for the base model we mentioned previously, increasing to £2199 for the top-specced model.  The Microsoft Surface Book 2015 model starts at £1045 for the base model, increasing to £2649 for the top-specced model. The Microsoft Surface Book Performance Base will start at $2399 for the base model and it will be available mid-November.

By Will Nicol — October 27, 2016 8:41 AM Subscribe to this topic Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends The latest addition to Microsoft’s lineup of Surface products is the Surface Studio, an all-in-one computer designed for artists and other creative professionals. From what we have seen so far, it’s an impressive device. The Surface Studio could be a shot across the bow to other all-in-one manufacturers like HP, whose latest Envy 27 model is one of the best all-in-one desktops around. In this clash of the expensive titans, who will prevail? While we cannot say for sure until we test the Studio for ourselves, we can make a preliminary ruling by examining the available specs. Related: Microsoft unveils pricey but powerful Surface Book update, Surface Studio at NY event Microsoft Surface Studio HP Envy All-in-One 27 Dimensions 25.1 x 17.3 x 0.5 in 25.7 x 19.3 x 7.95 in Weight 21 lbs 24 lbs Processor  Intel i5 or i7  Intel i5 or i7 RAM 8, 16, 32GB 8, 12, 16GB Graphics Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M, Nvidia GeForce GTX 980M  2GB Nvidia GeForce GTX 950M Display 28” PixelSense Display LCD 27” LED QHD Resolution 4,500 x 3,000 2,560 x 1,440 Storage 1TB or 2TB Rapid Hybrid Drive 1TB SATA hard disk, optional SSDs Networking  802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0, Xbox Wireless  802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.2 Ports 4 x USB 3.0 (one high power port)Full-size SD card reader (SDXC) compatibleMini DisplayPortHeadset jackCompatible with Surface Dial on-screen interaction*1 Gigabit Ethernet port USB 3.0 Type A, one USB 3.1 Type C, plus HDMI-in and HDMI-out, headphone/microphone jack Webcam 5.0 MP camera with 1080p HD video (front)Autofocus camera with 1080p HD video (rear) 1080p HD IR camera Operating System Windows 10 Windows 10 Price $3,000 $1,300 Availability Pre-order at Microsoft HP Review  N/A N/A Specs Both of these computers offer models that include Intel Core i5 or i7 processors. We actually don’t know yet what exact models the Surface Studio will ship with, but they’ll probably be 65-watt or 95-watt variants of the desktop line. HP’s Envy, by contrast, has a 35-watt “T” series chip. So it’s likely that, due to its lower power draw, its performance will be a hair behind the Surface Studio. The Studio and the Envy start at 8GB of RAM, although the Studio maxes out at 32GB, which is twice that of the Envy’s maximum of 16GB. Frankly, 32GB is overkill for all but the most extreme scenarios. But if you want it, only the Surface Studio has it. The Studio also edges the Envy out in terms of graphical power — its lower-tier option is a GeForce 965M, a graphics card that is still better than the Envy’s GeForce 950M. This should help when powering professional 3D applications, performing GPU compute operations and, of course, when playing games. Overall, the Surface Studio has a bit more juice than the Envy, although the differences are not massive. Display The Envy sports a 27-inch QHD display with 2,560 x 1,440-pixel resolution, which amounts to 3.6 million pixels. The Studio features a 28-inch display, with 13.5 million pixels and 4,500 x 3,000-pixel resolution. Both displays have touchscreens, although the Studio’s display works with the Surface pen as well as the new Surface Dial, which can fasten to the screen, allowing users to easily use rotary functions. The Surface Studio also has the built-in ability to instantly switch color spaces using a toggle in the Windows notification pane. That’s a handy extra that artists and photographers will love. Although the Envy’s display is great, the Surface Studio looks to blow it out of the water. Connectivity There isn’t much difference in connectivity. Both machines have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, however, the Studio only uses Bluetooth 4.0, whereas the Envy has 4.2, which is slightly faster. The Surface Studio does have Xbox Wireless built-in, so if you want to connect an Xbox controller to your PC, you can do so easily. Given how the Surface seems geared toward art and design, this seems somewhat superfluous, but it’s a nice addition nonetheless. Design This is a win-win scenario. Both machines are designed with an eye toward artistry, cramming the computer components into discrete base units, allowing for thin, lightweight monitors. The Envy has a glass display mounted on a slim metal stand;, resulting in a machine with a unobtrusive profile. The built-in webcam can also retract into the display when not in use, keeping the profile simple and protecting the user’s privacy. The Envy’s base has built-in Bang & Olufsen speakers, with a simple touchpad for adjusting volume. Microsoft described the Studio’s display as a “floating sheet of pixels,” and the metaphor is apt. The absurdly slim display rests on a chrome “zero gravity hinge,” which allows the user to maneuver the display to various configurations. Keep it upright, lay it flat, or anything in between. This makes it a great tool for creative sorts who want to draw or edit images by hand. Going off the claims by Microsoft, moving the display should feel effortless. The Studio features a discrete webcam and Dolby speakers. The Studio’s accessories are a big part of the draw. The Surface Pen and Dial open up huge possibilities for those who like to work with their hands. The Dial allows users to rotate images on the screen, shrink or enlarge images, and more, with straightforward haptic feedback. Availability and price Perhaps the biggest distinction between the two machines is pricing. The cheapest version of of the Envy costs $1,300, running up to $1,700. The Studio, meanwhile, bottoms out at an astounding $3,000, with the most expensive version running a cost of $4,200. The latest model Envy is available now, while the Surface is currently available for preorder, set to be released December 15, 2016. Conclusion Overall, the Surface Studio seems like a more powerful, more beautiful machine than the Envy, but it comes with a tremendous price tag. Whether users should choose one or the other is largely a matter of lifestyle. For creative professionals — artists, architects, and so on — who want a desktop they can do all their work on, the Surface is clearly designed for them. It can recline back for easier touch use, which is something the HP Envy AIO doesn’t do, and it has unique productivity peripherals, like the Surface Dial. For everyone else, the Envy seems like a much more affordable device with a great deal of functionality. Also watch: HP Spectre Review Please enable Javascript to watch this video

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 27, 2016 at 12:02PM There have been rumors going around -- more like speculation -- that at some point Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will tap Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) to manufacture its A-series applications processors for the iPhone. Not only that, but that same line of speculation also calls for Apple to integrate Intel's modem technology into its processors as part of the contract chip manufacturing negotiation. I have written about why I don't see this as likely at any point in the near to medium term -- mainly because such a project would be quite risky with significant potential points of failure that are outside Apple's control. Thanks to some new data, the argument against this becomes substantially stronger. Image source: Intel.  Intel's modems perform poorly It would be risky enough for Apple to both migrate to Intel for chip manufacturing services and to incorporate Intel's modem technology in an Apple chip design even if Intel's modems were best-in-class performers. The argument totally falls apart if Intel's modems simply aren't that good. As luck would have it, Cellular Insights recently compared the cellular performances of the iPhone 7 with an Intel modem and the iPhone 7 with a Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) modem, finding that the Qualcomm version delivers vastly superior cellular performance to the Intel modem. Or, put a little more bluntly, the Intel modem isn't up to snuff. It seems that Apple didn't choose to use the Intel modem for its performance or quality -- otherwise, Intel clearly wouldn't have won the design -- but rather as a means of making sure that it has multiple suppliers for modems going forward. It appears unlikely that Apple would risk embedding a modem from a second-rate modem supplier into its industry-leading A-series processors. Indeed, if Apple were interested in integrating a modem into its smartphone processors in the near term, a licensing deal with Qualcomm for its modem technology would be the more logical choice, though it's not clear how amenable Qualcomm would be to that, given that its modem technology is its crown jewel. Over the long term, Apple may need to build its own Today, Apple uses standalone modems from both Qualcomm and Intel, making it the only major smartphone vendor to not use modems integrated into the applications processor itself. Apple could conceivably keep on simply using standalone modems from multiple vendors, or it could build an in-house modem for eventual integration into the A-series processors. I suspect that for the next several generations at least, Apple will continue to use standalone modems. Building a competent, let alone leadership, modem is no easy feat -- especially if the technology is being built largely from scratch, as an Apple modem probably would be. Over the long term, though, I wouldn't be surprised if Apple built its own, if only to eliminate its dependence on third-party suppliers for such a critical component. Such an effort would be expensive, and likely to produce many failed modems along the way. But if Apple is serious about it, I suspect it'll eventually be able to build its own competent cellular modem. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel and Qualcomm.

"The centre will enable research institutions and academia to test their applications on our high performance computing platform as a service with Intel technologies for early adoption," said HPE India Director Vikram K on Thursday. Customers can access the platform even remotely through a cloud-driven model, which can be replicated in their data centres. Indian research institutions and academia use high performance computing for big data analytics and simulations of complex processes and in large projects. "High performance computing will play a major role in the government's proposed National Supercomputing Mission, which will create a grid of 70 supercomputers, connecting academic and research institutions across the country for developing applications of national use," Vikram told reporters here on the occasion. The HPE-Intel centre will also train new users and enable developers to hone their ability to leverage parallelism and vectorisation in Intel's central processing units. "There is a need in research and academic institutions for computational power to process large volumes of data, solve complex mathematical problems and repeat calculations for multiplicative situations," asserted Vikram. With Intel technology and HPE's systems and services, the centre will also allow customers to validate their applications and achieve optimised system performance and scale," added Intel Regional Manager Ravi Gupta. fb/pgh/dg Previous News Next News News Categories World India Business Sports Bollywood Hollywood Health Technology Automobile Travel Computer Features BEST OF NK News Maps Travel India Info Games Education Self Help Recipes Names Astrology © Copyright 2016.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 27, 2016 at 8:49AM Later today, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will have its long-awaited product launch event, and many people will be looking to see whether new MacBooks will be powered by Apple's own A10X processor rather than a processor from longtime Mac processor supplier, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Ahead of the reveal, I'm going to make a not-so-bold prediction and say that every MacBook Apple announces at this event will be powered by an Intel processor. Apple's soon-to-be replaced MacBook Pro models. Image source: Apple.  Author J.M. Manness, writing for Seeking Alpha, recently argued that some of the new Mac computers could sport Apple's own processor. The author cites a variety of reasons, including a recent "clue" embedded in a source code file related to Mac OS X, for why this will be the case -- though that clue was thoroughly debunked in this post over at RealWorldTech.  Here are a couple of common-sense reasons why I disagree. No financial evidence that Intel has lost this year's Macs Perhaps the most convincing pieces of evidence are Intel's financial results in the third quarter and its guidance for the fourth quarter. Apple is far from Intel's largest customer, but if one assumes that Intel sells Apple around 20 million chips per year at an average price of around $150, then it's not farfetched to assume that Intel's annual Apple-related revenue comes in at about $3 billion. Even in the context of the nearly $60 billion in revenue that Intel is expected to bring in this year, that's not a small number. So if Apple were planning to ditch Intel in a high-volume Mac product, like a MacBook, then Intel would almost certainly report a sizable drop in revenue related to that design. Instead, Intel positively pre-announced a much better-than-expected third quarter, largely because of better personal-computer chip sales, and its revenue in the fourth quarter is expected to be nearly the same as it was in the third quarter. In a nutshell, there's no financial evidence to suggest that Intel will be missing from a new Mac. Apple A10X won't be ready Apple's current tablet-class processor, the A9X, has been in the market for nearly a year and isn't as fast as the latest Intel mobile processors. The A10X would be a more realistic option, but there's a catch: the A10X chip is expected to be manufactured in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (NYSE:TSM) 10-nanometer manufacturing technology. TSMC has gone on record to say it doesn't expect to recognize revenue from this technology until the first quarter of 2017. To support a MacBook launch on Oct. 27, Apple would have needed to put the A10X into production in the late June-to-early July timeframe. Considering that TSMC's 10-nanometer process wasn't ready to begin mass production at that point, this is a complete non-starter. Now, Apple is expected to launch new iMacs in the middle of the first half of 2017, per Ming-Chi Kuo, so the A10X would be ready in time for those devices. However, it's extremely unlikely that Apple would outfit any member of its iMac line with a mobile-focused A10X chip that simply can't run macOS or any of the software that's written for it. A10X implements the ARM architecture; macOS is designed around the Intel, or x86, architecture. Don't bet on seeing Intel get kicked out of the Mac anytime soon There will always be those looking to bet on seeing Intel evicted from the Mac, and one day it may very well happen. However, as long as Intel continues to deliver excellent processors aimed at the notebook and desktop personal computer markets, I believe that the company will continue to enjoy many more years of Mac-related revenue.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

The round includes new investors Lenovo, City National Bank, Epsilon Venture Partners, and DVP Investment. Also participating were all existing investors, including Intel Capital, INCJ, Eight Roads (the proprietary investment arm of FIL, Fidelity International Limited), and Goldman Sachs. The funding brings Cloudian's total capital raised to date to $79 million. Logo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20120918/SF75609LOGO The new funds will fuel the company's growth by accelerating innovation, expanding sales and marketing, and growing international operations to meet the rapidly rising demand for scale-out, hybrid cloud object storage solutions. "Data center managers need new solutions to help them contend with today's explosive growth in unstructured data. Across all industries – from media, to medical, to industrial – new applications and technologies are driving 50 percent growth of unstructured data per year, creating a crisis of cost and complexity for storage managers," said Michael Tso, CEO and co-founder, Cloudian. "Cloudian object storage redefines the enterprise data center with hybrid cloud solutions that bring the flexibility and simplicity of public cloud storage into our customer's data centers, simplifying management and reducing TCO by 70 percent versus conventional storage systems." Over the past year, Cloudian has rapidly accelerated customer acceptance with 300 percent increase in bookings, 100 percent growth in its customer base and 100 percent customer retention. Cloudian customers value the company's modular, scale-out design that allows a single storage manager to effectively manage hundreds of petabytes of capacity, a level that would require a dozen or more storage managers with conventional systems. "Connected devices are already generating millions of terabytes of information every day. The challenge is both to manage that information and to analyze and derive value from it," said Lisa Spelman, vice president and general manager, Data Center Marketing Group, Intel. "We believe Cloudian's unified storage approach, which combines data management and data analytics in a single platform running on Intel Architecture, positions data center managers exceptionally well to extract value from the massive volumes of information created by accelerating device connectivity and advances in machine learning." In August, Cloudian announced the availability of Cloudian HyperStore on AWS Marketplace. This enables customers to purchase their on-premises storage on a metered-by-use basis, manage it alongside Amazon S3 storage as a single pool, and then receive a single invoice for both. Furthermore, in June of this year, Cloudian and Lenovo announced an OEM agreement that enables Lenovo's worldwide sales force to offer a Cloudian-based object storage appliance. "Lenovo is committed to driving innovation, efficiency and investment protection into the datacenter," said Peter Hortensius, chief technology and strategy officer, Data Center Group, Lenovo. "This is achieved through both internal development and through investing in partners with best-of-breed solutions. When researching for ways to address the explosive growth in data, Cloudian's storage solution, leveraging scalable x86 infrastructure, was the clear winner." On October 20, Google announced Google Cloud Storage Coldline, a long-term archival storage service. Cloudian is integrated with Coldline, allowing customers to create a hybrid storage environment for rapid data access and nearly instantaneous search. Users store and retrieve data from the Cloudian system on-premises, while applying policies for automatic data migration to Coldline. When data is migrated, metadata is retained within the Cloudian system, allowing Coldline-stored data to be searched locally to accelerate data discovery. Administrators manage all their data, whether on-premises or in the cloud, as a single storage pool. "Until recently the focus for most storage administrators was to store and manage large amounts of data. Businesses are now looking to analyze this goldmine of data to find patterns that could enhance products or services," says Amita Potnis, research manager, IDC. "Cloudian has tackled both problems with a scale-out design and an integrated insight engine that lets users store and analyze data on the same system. This combination changes the game in large-scale storage deployments." Earlier this year Cloudian announced HyperStore 6.0, a significant platform update that bolstered the product's capabilities with proactive data repair, Amazon S3 cross-region replication for disaster recovery, and smart storage features to expand the product's in-platform analytics capabilities. "The challenge of long-term data management is evolving way beyond simply accommodating storage capacity," said Steven Hill, senior storage analyst, 451 Research. "While storing and protecting data remain primary considerations, metadata is the key to extending the value of business data throughout its entire lifecycle. The rich metadata capabilities offered by object storage technology like Cloudian's HyperStore platform, combines massive scalability with detailed and purposeful information about the data itself, whether on-prem or in the cloud." Cloudian HyperStore provides enterprises and managed service provider with petabyte-scale storage, data protection, and smart analytics for use cases including backup/archive, media and entertainment, bioinformatics, IoT, and more. HyperStore can scale from just three nodes to hundreds, allowing systems to be right-sized for any application or organizational need. Cloudian solutions are available as an appliance or as stand-alone software for commodity hardware, and may be configured with a file connector that facilitates CIFS, NFS and FTP services.

At its October event, Microsoft announced upgraded Surface Book which is the most powerful version ever produced. Microsoft is calling the new device – Surface Book i7 – clearly denoting the use of Intel’s Core i7 processor. Microsoft’s updated Surface Book features NVIDIA’s GTX 965M GPU capable of pushing 1.9 teraflops of graphics performance. Microsoft says it redesigned the cooling system in order to allow the processor and GPU work in full force. Microsoft is also touting the battery life upgrade to 16 hours – which definitely means all day battery life. However, Microsoft is not refreshing the design of Surface Book by retaining the all aluminium unibody chassis and dynamic fulcrum hinge. Microsoft says the updated processor allows room for a larger battery and it shows in the form of additional weight. Microsoft Surface Book weighs 1.64Kg in comparison with its predecessor, which weighed around 1.57 kilograms. Microsoft announced Surface Book last year in October as an ideal Windows 10 notebook. While Surface Pro 4 was an hybrid, Surface Book pretended to the full fledged laptop with its own chiclet style keyboard. With Surface Book, Microsoft packed all the guts of the device into the display and made the display detachable for use as a tablet. Microsoft Surface Book features a 13.5-inch PixelSense display with a resolution of 3000 x 2000 pixels and an aspect ratio of 3:2. The Surface Book also comes with Surface Pen for inking and comes in 8 or 16GB RAM. Microsoft Surface Book will be available with 256GB, 512GB or 1TB storage options priced at $2,399, $2,799, and $3,299, respectively. Microsoft’s upgraded Surface Book is up for preorder now and will be available on November 10. The laptop is not expected to hit Indian markets anytime soon. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Express TechIE Samsung Galaxy S7 Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Gionee S6 Xiaomi Mi 5 Best of Express 26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & Instagram IndiaLIVE: Calls grow for PM Modi to address House over Demonetisation IndiaRahul Gandhi: PM Narendra Modi is running the government of few industrialists IndiaSushma Swaraj suffers kidney failure, undergoes dialysis at AIIMS BusinessSBI writes off Rs 7,016 crore loans owed by wilful defaulters IndiaBirla text message shows payoff to ‘Gujarat CM’ in 2012, says Arvind Kejriwal EntertainmentI am besharam, nudity means nothing to me: Ranveer Singh on Befikre EntertainmentBefikre and all its kisses get U/A certificate, Ranveer Singh calls it family film EntertainmentDirector Ameer questions Rajinikanth's integrity for supporting PM Modi's demonetisation EntertainmentTwinkle asked Karan full form of MNS, his reply will make you forget KWK Must Read SportsDemonetisation greatest move in Indian politics: Kohli SportsThere will be few surprises in the playing XI: Virat Kohli SportsHow the mighty Aussies have fallen TechnologyOnePlus 3T vs OnePlus 3: What's the big difference?

Ken Caviasca, vice president in the Internet of Things Group and general manager of platform engineering and development at Intel Corporation, said the new E3900 chips are exceptionally capable of delivering on performance, processing and scalability with more than 1.7 times more computing power compared to the previous generation. Built into a compact flip chip ball grid array (FCBGA) using a 14-nanometer process, the series uses Intel’s ninth-gen graphics engine that improves 3D graphics performance by 2.9 times and can support up to three independent displays. Furthermore, the E3900 series utilizes four vector image processing units which afford better visibility, quality video in low light, noise reduction and color / detail preservation. With more localized processing power, systems using the chips won’t have to pipe all CPU-intensive tasks to data centers for processing. Intel’s new A3900 series, meanwhile, can be used to power a complete cockpit solution that includes in-vehicle infotainment systems, digital instrument clusters and even advanced driver assistance systems. Caviasca said Intel is currently sampling the A3900 series SoCs to customers with plans to make them available in the first quarter of next year.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 26, 2016 at 8:06PM In 2015, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) talked up a new type of memory technology that it had developed jointly with memory specialist Micron, known as 3D XPoint. In a nutshell, 3D XPoint is pitched as a memory technology that's supposed to sit in between traditional DRAM and NAND flash in terms of speed, endurance, and cost. A wafer of 3D XPoint chips. Image source: Micron.  Although it's not quite clear how large the market opportunity for this technology is, investors are likely to begin to find out next year as the company begins production shipments of the technology. 3D XPoint to ramp in 2017 According to Intel CEO Brian Krzanich on the company's most recent earnings call, the company plans to "ship thousands of [3D XPoint] samples to customers" as the current quarter progresses. He also said Intel is aiming to qualify 3D XPoint for production "at the end of the quarter." Once the technology is qualified for production, the company aims to ramp up production of 3D XPoint throughout 2017, which is when investors should expect to see revenue from the product flowing into the company's top and bottom lines. 3D XPoint SSDs first, memory modules later During the call, Krzanich made clear that Intel's upcoming Purley server platform won't feature support for 3D XPoint memory modules (in other words, substitutes for traditional DRAM) at the outset -- that support is now expected to come with the company's second-generation processor family on the Purley platform. The earliest that investors should expect such memory modules is sometime in 2018. It's important to understand, however, that this doesn't mean Intel won't be selling 3D XPoint into the server market throughout 2017. It simply means that the first server-bound 3D XPoint products will be storage drives just like today's NAND-flash-based solid-state drives, just way faster. If 3D XPoint delivers what Intel claims it delivers, then there could be a significant revenue opportunity just from storage drives based on the technology. However, what Intel seems to be more excited about is the prospect of selling memory modules based on this technology to stand in for traditional DRAM. Memory module opportunity likely more interesting to Intel I suspect that sales of 3D XPoint-based storage drives will, to some degree, eat into sales of traditional solid-state drives. Intel sells such drives, so to the extent that a 3D XPoint storage device is sold in place of a traditional solid-state drive, Intel may not always come out ahead. Memory modules are a whole different ballgame, however. Every 3D XPoint memory module that Intel sells would presumably be in place of a traditional DRAM-based memory module. Today, Intel doesn't manufacture or sell DRAM products, so to the extent that 3D XPoint can be substituted in for DRAM, Intel stands to enjoy revenue upside. Image source: Intel, via KitGuru.  It goes beyond near-term revenue, though. Intel currently commands nearly the entirety of the server processor market, and it would obviously like to keep as much of that share as possible, even as many chip competitors try to rip away market share. Should these 3D XPoint memory modules prove to offer a real and compelling value proposition to data-center operators, and should those memory modules work only with Intel's processors, they could be instrumental to helping Intel maintain extremely high server processor market share. Considering how much Intel has riding on its ability to maintain a strong position in the server market, it's little surprise that the company would be interested in developing compelling complementary platform technologies that only work with its platforms.

In this June file photo, a man walks past a logo of Intel during the annual Computex computer exhibition in Taipei. (REUTERS) Mike FreemanContact Reporter After watching the growth of the 3G and 4G mobile wireless markets from the sidelines, chip giant Intel aims to be a key player in the upcoming transition to high-speed 5G networks. Murthy Renduchintala, president of Intel’s mobile and Internet of things group, talked Wednesday about the company’s 5G efforts at the Intel Capital Global Summit in San Diego. “Clearly Intel was late coming to the party on 4G,” he said in an interview. “But I think at least from a modem perspective, we are now sitting at the party table.” Intel netted a big victory in its struggling mobile efforts this year when Apple used Intel’s 4G cellular modems in some models of the new iPhone 7 — replacing Qualcomm’s chips. In the U.S., iPhone 7s on the AT&T and T-Mobile networks contain Intel modems. iPhone 7s on Verizon and Sprint have cellular modems from Qualcomm. “We have demonstrated a competence and credibility that is hopefully being recognized by the industry,” said Renduchintala, who spent a dozen years at Qualcomm before joining Intel last November. “We are going to build on that and use that as the foundation on which to push forward with our 5G ambition.” Caption Why Millennials aren't moving to San Diego Despite hip locales, craft beer and a bike lanes, San Diego County had one of the smaller millennial population increases in the nation from 2005 to 2015, said a study from Apartment List Rentonomics released Tuesday.  Despite hip locales, craft beer and a bike lanes, San Diego County had one of the smaller millennial population increases in the nation from 2005 to 2015, said a study from Apartment List Rentonomics released Tuesday.  Caption Why Millennials aren't moving to San Diego Despite hip locales, craft beer and a bike lanes, San Diego County had one of the smaller millennial population increases in the nation from 2005 to 2015, said a study from Apartment List Rentonomics released Tuesday.  Despite hip locales, craft beer and a bike lanes, San Diego County had one of the smaller millennial population increases in the nation from 2005 to 2015, said a study from Apartment List Rentonomics released Tuesday.  Caption Lyft’s new logo Lyft is replacing its distinctive pink mustache logo with beacons.

To find possible survey participants, the San Diego Union-Tribune used print and online advertising to seek nominations from workers, bosses and others. Qualcomm is betting on being the leader in ultra-fast 5G technology as well. Last week, the San Diego company said it would deliver the first 5G wireless modem — the Snapdragon X50 — for sampling in the second half of 2017. With peak download speeds of 5 gigabits per second — more than five times faster than today’s top 4G chips — the modem is expected to be used in early 5G trials next year. It could show up in commercial products in 2018. Intel hasn’t announced a 5G chip. But it is participating in global 5G technology trials in the U.S. and elsewhere with wireless industry partners, said Renduchintala. It also is contributing to the technology standards process for 5G. Verizon Communications Chief Executive Lowell McAdam was a keynote speaker at the Intel Capital event and referred to the bandwidth capabilities of 5G technology as “wireless fiber,” according to Renduchintala. “I think he said 50 percent of his costs in a fiber roll-out is from the lamp post to the home,” said Renduchintala. “So he’s basically saying if I can get high-speed ‘wireless fiber’ to the house, it would make deployments much more rapid and much more economically viable.” Intel Capital is the technology giant’s corporate venture capital arm. This week it announced $38 million in investments in 12 startups working in robotics, big data, connectivity, sports/health and virtual reality. None of the startups was local. But earlier this year, Intel purchased San Diego-based Nervana Systems for more than $400 million, according to reports. The 48-employee company has developed a deep learning platform for analyzing very large pools of data. It can be used in health care, precision farming, facial recognition, self-correcting vehicles, energy exploration — any application that seeks to uncover insights from data automatically.   “What is really exciting about deep learning is we can automate tasks that we thought were human tasks,” said Nervana co-founder Naveen Rao, now general manager of Intel’s artificial intelligence group. “Looking at radiological scans, or looking at geo-seismic studies to find oil and gas. That is something that we can now put into a machine, make it really cheap and get the best (analysis) out to everyone.” mike.freeman@sduniontribune.com;  Twitter:@TechDiego 760-529-4973 Copyright © 2016, The San Diego Union-Tribune Apple iPhone US Politics Latest Most Popular Jobs Homes Cars Customer Help Today's Paper 64°

Creative Commons Zero Over the past decade, the majority of new open source OS projects have shifted from the mobile market to the Internet of Things. In this fifth article in our IoT series, we look at the many new open source operating systems that target IoT. Our previous posts have examined open source IoT frameworks, as well as Linux- and open source development hardware for IoT and consumer smart home devices. But it all starts with the OS. In addition to exploring new IoT-focused embedded Linux-based distributions, I’ve included a few older lightweight distributions like OpenWrt that have seen renewed uptake in the segment. While the Linux distros are aimed primarily at gateways and hubs, there has been equivalent growth in non-Linux, open source OSes for IoT that can run on microcontroller units (MCUs), and are typically aimed at IoT edge devices. Keep in mind that almost all OSes these day are claiming some IoT connection, so the list is somewhat arbitrary. The contenders here fulfill most of the following properties: low memory footprint, high power efficiency, a modular and configurable communication stack, and strong support for specific wireless and sensor technologies. Some projects emphasize IoT security, and many of the non-Linux OSes focus on real-time determinism, which is sometimes a requirement in industrial IoT. I have generally steered clear of Linux distros that are categorized as “lightweight” but are still largely aimed at desktop use or portable USB stick implementations, rather than headless devices. Still, lightweight Linux distros such as LXLE or Linux Lite could be good choices for IoT. The choices were more difficult with non-Linux open source platforms. After all, most lightweight RTOSes can be used for IoT. I focused on the major platforms, or those that seemed to offer the most promise for IoT. Other potential candidates can be found at this Open Source RTOS site. Not included here is Windows 10 for IoT Core, which is free to makers and supports AllJoyn and IoTivity, but is not fully open source. There are also a number of commercial RTOSes that are major players in IoT, such as Micrium’s µC/OS. Nine Linux-based open source IoT distros Brillo -- In the year since Google released Brillo, the lightweight Android-based distro has seen growing adoption among hacker boards such as the Intel Edison and Dragonboard 410c, and even some computer-on-modules. The future of Brillo is tied to Google’s Weave communications protocol, which it requires. Weave brings discovery, provisioning, and authentication functions to Brillo, which can run on as little as 32MB RAM and 128MB flash. Huawei LiteOS -- Huawei’s LiteOS, which is not to be confused with the open source Unix variant, is said to be based on Linux, but it must be a very lean implementation indeed. Announced over a year ago, LiteOS is claimed to be deployable as a kernel as small as 10KB. LiteOS ranges from MCU-based devices to Android-compatible applications processors. The customizable OS is touted for its zero configuration, auto-discovery, auto-networking, fast boot, and real-time operation, and it offers extensive wireless support, including LTE and mesh networking. LiteOS is available with Huawei’s Agile IoT Solution, and it drives its Narrow-band IoT (NB-IoT) Solution. OpenWrt/LEDE/Linino/DD-Wrt -- The venerable, networking-focused OpenWrt embedded Linux distro has seen a resurgence due to the IoT craze. The lightweight OpenWrt is frequently found on routers and MIPS-based WiFi boards. Earlier spin-offs such as DD-Wrt and the Arduino-focused Linino have recently been followed by an outright fork. The Linux Embedded Development Environment (LEDE) project promises more transparent governance and predictable release cycles. Ostro Linux -- This Yocto Project based distro broke into the limelight in August when Intel chose it for its Intel Joule module, where it runs on the latest quad-core Atom T5700 SoC. Ostro Linux is compliant with IoTivity, supports numerous wireless technologies, and offers a sensor framework. It has a major focus on IoT security, providing OS-, device-, application, and data-level protections, including cryptography and MAC. The distribution is available in headless and media (XT) versions. Raspbian -- There are some other distributions for the Raspberry Pi that are more specifically aimed at IoT, but the quickly maturing Raspbian is still the best. Because it’s the most popular distro for DIY projects on one of the most widely used IoT platforms, developers can call upon numerous projects and tutorials for help. Now that Raspbian supports Node-RED, the visual design tool for Node-JS, we see less reason to opt for the RPi-specific, IoT-focused Thingbox. Snappy Ubuntu Core -- Also called Ubuntu Core with Snaps, this embedded version of Ubuntu Core draws upon a Snap package mechanism that Canonical is spinning off as a universal Linux package format, enabling a single binary package to work on “any Linux desktop, server, cloud or device.” Snaps enable Snappy Ubuntu Core to offer transactional rollbacks, secure updates, cloud support, and an app store platform. Snappy requires only a 600MHz CPU and 128MB RAM, but also needs 4GB of flash. It runs on the Pi and other hacker boards, and has appeared on devices including Erle-Copter drones, Dell Edge Gateways, Nextcloud Box, and LimeSDR. Tizen -- Primarily backed by Samsung, the Linux Foundation hosted embedded Linux stack has barely registered in the mobile market. However, it has been widely used in Samsung TVs and smartwatches, including the new Gear S3, and has been sporadically implemented in its cameras and consumer appliances. Tizen can even run on the Raspberry Pi. Samsung has begun to integrate Tizen with its SmartThings smart home system, enabling SmartThings control from Samsung TVs. We can also expect more integration with Samsung’s Artik modules and Artik Cloud. Artik ships with Fedora, but Tizen 3.0 has recently been ported, along with Ubuntu Core. uClinux -- The venerable, stripped-down uClinux is the only form of Linux that can run on MCUs, and only then on specific Cortex-M3, M4, and -M7 models. uClinux requires MCUs with built-in memory controllers that can use an external DRAM chip to meet its RAM requirements. Now merged into the mainline Linux kernel, uClinux benefits from the extensive wireless support found in Linux. However, newer MCU-oriented OSes such as Mbed are closing the gap quickly on wireless, and are easier to configure. EmCraft is one of the biggest boosters for uClinux on MCUs, offering a variety of Cortex-M-based modules with uClinux BSPs. Yocto Project -- The Linux Foundation’s Yocto Project is not a Linux distro, but an open source collaborative project to provide developers with templates, tools, and methods to create custom embedded stacks. Because you can customize stacks with minimal overhead, it’s frequently used for IoT. Yocto Project forms the basis for most commercial embedded Linux distros, and is part of projects such as Ostro Linux and Qt for Device Creation. Qt is prepping a Qt Lite technology for Qt 5.8 that will optimize Device Creation for smaller IoT targets. Non-Linux Open Source IoT OSes Apache Mynewt -- The open source, wireless savvy Apache Mynewt for 32-bit MCUs was developed by Runtime and hosted by the Apache Software Foundation. The modular Apache Mynewt is touted for its wireless support, precise configurability of concurrent connections, debugging features, and granular power controls. In May, Runtime and Arduino Srl announced that Apache Mynewt would be available for Arduino Srl’s Primo and STAR Otto SBCs. The OS also supports Arduino LLC boards like the Arduino Zero. (Recently, Arduino Srl and Arduino LLC settled their legal differences, announcing plans to reunite under an Arduino Holding company and Arduino Foundation.) ARM Mbed -- ARM’s IoT-oriented OS targets tiny, battery-powered IoT endpoints running on Cortex-M MCUs with as little as 8KB of RAM, and has appeared on the BBC Micro:bit SBC. Although originally semi-proprietary, single threaded only, and lacking deterministic features, it’s now open sourced under Apache 2.0, and provides multithreading and RTOS support. Unlike many lightweight RTOSes, Mbed was designed with wireless communications in mind, and it recently added Thread support. The OS supports cloud services that can securely extract data via an Mbed Device Connector. Earlier this year, the project launched a Wearable Reference Design. Contiki -- With its 10KB RAM and 30KB flash requirements, the open source Contiki can’t get as tiny as Tiny OS or RIOT OS, nor does it offer real-time determinism like RIOT and some others. However, the widely used Contiki provides extensive wireless networking support, with an IPv6 stack contributed by Cisco. The OS supplies a comprehensive list of development tools including a dynamic module loading Cooja Network Simulator for debugging wireless networks. Contiki is touted for efficient memory allocation. FreeRTOS -- FreeRTOS is coming close to rivaling Linux among embedded development platforms, and it’s particularly popular for developing IoT end devices. FreeRTOS lacks Linux features such as device drivers, user accounts, and advanced networking and memory management. However, it has a far smaller footprint than Linux, not to mention mainstream RTOSes like VxWorks, and it offers an open source GPL license. FreeRTOS can run on under a half kilobyte of RAM and 5-10KB of ROM, although more typically when used with a TCP/IP stack, it’s more like 24KB of RAM and 60KB flash. Fuchsia -- Google’s latest open source OS was partially revealed in August, leaving more questions than answers. The fact that Fuchsia has no relation to Linux, but is based on an LK distro designed to compete with MCU-oriented OSes such as FreeRTOS, led many to speculate that it’s an IoT OS. Yet, Fuchsia also supports mobile and laptop computers, so Google may have much broader ambitions for this early-stage project. NuttX -- The non-restrictive BSD licensed NuttX is known primarily for being the most common RTOS for open source drones running on APM/ArduPilot and PX4 UAV platform, which are collectively part of the Dronecode platform. NuttX is widely used in other resource-constrained embedded systems, as well. Although it supports x86 and Cortex-A5 and -A8 platforms, this POSIX- and ANSI-based OS is primarily aimed at Cortex-M MCUs. NuttX is fully pre-emptible, with fixed priority, round-robin, and sporadic scheduling. The OS is billed as “a tiny Linux work-alike with a much reduced feature set.” RIOT OS -- The 8-year old RIOT OS is known for its efficient power usage and widespread wireless support. RIOT offers hardware requirements of 1.5KB RAM and 5KB of flash that are almost as low as Tiny OS. Yet it also offers features like multi-threading, dynamic memory management, hardware abstraction, partial POSIX compliance, and C++ support, which are more typical of Linux than lightweight RTOSes. Other features include a low interrupt latency of roughly 40 clock cycles, and priority-based scheduling. You can develop under Linux or OS X and deploy to embedded devices using a native port. TinyOS -- This mature, open source BSD-licensed OS is about as tiny as you can get, supporting low power consumption on MCU targets “with a few kB of RAM and a few tens of kB of code space.” Written in a C dialect called nesC, the event-driven TinyOS is used by researchers exploring low-power wireless networking, including multi-hop nets. By the project’s own admission, “computationally-intensive applications can be difficult to write.” The project is working on Cortex-M3 support, but for now it’s still designed for lower-end MCUs and radio chips. Zephyr -- The Linux Foundation’s lightweight, security-enabled Zephyr RTOS runs on as little as 2-8KB of RAM. Zephyr works on x86, ARM, and ARC systems, but focuses primarily on MCU-based devices with Bluetooth/BLE and 802.15.4 radios like 6LoWPAN. Zephyr is based on Wind River’s Rocket OS, which is based on Viper, a stripped-down version of VxWorks. Initial targets include the Arduino Due and Intel’s Arduino 101, among others. Zephyr recently appeared on SeeedStudio’s 96Boards IoT Edition BLE Carbon SBC, which is supported by a new Linaro LITE group.

In ideal conditions, the two modems perform equally well. But research firm Cellular Insights claims that at the edge of cell coverage areas, where signal strength falls off, the iPhone 7 model with the Intel modem is less capable. The iPhone 7 (A1660) and iPhone 7 Plus (A1661) sport the Qualcomm modem. Variant models, the iPhone 7 (A1778) and iPhone 7 Plus (A1784), come with the Intel modem. For US customers, Sprint and Verizon offer the Qualcomm-powered iPhone. AT&T and T‑Mobile US sell the Intel-equipped version, which won't work on the CDMA networks operated by Sprint or Verizon. The Qualcomm modem supports a wider set of protocols, making it usable on any of the big four carrier networks in the US. So unlocked iPhone 7 models purchased for Sprint or Verizon in the US can be used with the networks operated by AT&T or T‑Mobile US. Apple provides information about where its various iPhone 7 models are available on its website. Cellular Insights tested the LTE performance of the two modems across three bands, Band 12 (10MHz), Band 4 (20MHz), and Band 7 (20MHz) in 4×2 MIMO configuration using Transmission Mode 4. According to the firm's report, iPhone 7 models with the Intel modem exhibited 30 per cent worse LTE performance on average than their Qualcomm-equipped counterparts when conditions were not ideal. With a strong wireless signal, the two variants kept pace. But at lower signal strengths, differences start to emerge. At -95dBM, the Intel modem required an adjustment of its Transport Block Size because the Block Error Rate exceeded 2 per cent. With a signal measured at -105dBm, the Block Error Rate reached 20 per cent. And at -108dBm, it went to "a whopping 75 per cent." High error rates mean low LTE performance. "In all tests, the iPhone 7 Plus with the Qualcomm modem had a significant performance edge over the iPhone 7 Plus with the Intel modem," the report concludes. Apple's dual sourcing strategy reflects a desire to avoid having to waste space or money by having a large, expensive component so jammed with circuits that it will work with any telecom infrastructure, according to Fast Company. It also provides a defense against dependence on a single component supplier and price negotiation leverage. But the cost of this strategy if electronic components exhibit such varied performance may be customer satisfaction. Neither Apple nor Intel responded to requests for comment. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 22 Comments More from The Register Virtual reality is actually made of smartphones From the HoloLens to the PlayStation VR, all VR kit is descended from the first iPhone 49 Comments Anti-theft kill switches in smartphones just got a little less creepy US peeps now get more control over tracking and remote wipes 19 Comments Apple grounds AirPods launch with shipping delay No worries, just plug your old earbuds into the… oh, right 26 Comments Apple Watch exec Bob Mansfield 'gets into secret Apple car' Here in iCar, iCan only receive, iCan listen to you... 41 Comments Humanity will only buy 47 smartphones per SECOND in 2016 Last year we bought 44 per second, but growth has slowed so its frowning time 16 Comments Q.

ARM classifies its Cortex-branded chip designs according to their relative size and power. ‘A’ stands for ‘application processors’ such as the ones that provide the brains in smartphones. ‘R’ stands for ‘realtime’ and tends to apply to communications processors such as those found in modems. ‘M’ stands for ‘microcontroller’ and refers to the smallest chips, usually for embedded, industrial use. It is at this end of the scale that ARM expects to extend its mobile dominance into the IoT market, by designing tiny, ultra-low power chips that can be embedded into billions of devices and provide them with smarts and connectivity. The big launch was a new Cortex M family based on ARMv8-M architecture and apart from the usual core ARM claims about bang-per-buck/size/power, the special sauce seems to be the introduction of ARM TrustZone technology to this end of things. TrustZone is a crypto-cell technology that essentially introduces security at the chip level. The benefits of having IoT chips with security built in should be obvious to anyone worried about IoT heralding an era of hackers hijacking smart devices and sending them rogue like some kind of real-life Fantasia. “As IoT technologies become more pervasive, it is time for a complete solution that secures data from the sensor to the service,” said Pete Hutton, President of product groups at ARM. “ARM partners shipped a record 15 billion chips last year, many destined for smart embedded applications. The IoT already runs on ARM but the goal now is scale, which we are enabling today through a uniquely comprehensive set of technologies and services built to work together seamlessly.” Intel, meanwhile, unveiled the E3900 series, which is positioned as an IoT chip but seems to be designed more for ‘fog computing’ – i.e. decentralising and distributing the cloud. So this is more of a low-power datacenter chip, rather than one designed for IoT devices. It’s sensible for Intel to take this route to IoT as it’s probably never going to be able to compete with ARM on power efficiency so would lose a head-to-head battle in devices, just as it did in smartphones. Intel is the king of datacenters and hence the default chip-maker for the cloud. This launch seems to be designed to ensure Intel retains this position as fog computing becomes a thing. “The Intel Atom processor E3900 series will make the edge and fog more intelligent – enabling many of the processing needs to take place at or near the data sensor and alleviating the need to push all processing to the data center,” blogged Intel. “Fog computing, also known as fog networking, is a decentralized computing infrastructure in which computing resources and application services are distributed in the most logical place at any point from the data source to the cloud.” To show how serious it is about all this, Intel made a slick corporate video.

This Fool takes a look at whether the rumor that Intel is releasing its first 10-nanometer desktop processor in 2018 still makes sense in light of other leaked information. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 26, 2016 at 11:22AM Back in early September, DigiTimes -- citing an Intel product road map that it apparently obtained -- said Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) intends to launch a processor known as Coffee Lake for the desktop market during the second half of 2017. Image source: Intel.  DigiTimes also said those same product road maps indicated that the follow-on to Coffee Lake for desktop computers, known as Ice Lake, is expected to arrive in 2018. Considering some other leaks around Coffee Lake -- in particular, one leaked product road map that has been circulating the Web shows that Coffee Lake for notebook computers isn't expected to arrive until the second quarter of 2018 -- is it likely that DigiTimes' report is still accurate? Let's take a closer look. Could Coffee Lake come sooner for desktops than for notebooks? The road map that DigiTimes references is apparently a desktop processor road map. In contrast, the road map that contradicts the one that the DigiTimes article was based upon was about processors intended for use in laptops. It is conceivable that Intel might be planning to launch Coffee Lake for desktop computers first and then release the versions aimed at notebooks later. However, it's important to keep in mind that the chips that go into desktops and the ones that go into notebooks are based on the same exact silicon, so it's not clear if that hypothesis will ultimately hold up. If Coffee Lake is delayed, does that push out Ice Lake? Coffee Lake is Intel's Cannon Lake architecture -- a modest enhancement to the current generation Skylake architecture that powered Intel's sixth-generation Core processors and recently announced seventh-generation Core processors. It's also built on a variant of Intel's 14-nanometer manufacturing technology. Ice Lake, on the other hand, is expected to represent a brand-new architecture. The chip is also likely to be manufactured in some variant of Intel's upcoming 10-nanometer process -- I would expect it to be the company's second generation 10-nanometer+ technology. Ice Lake is likely to offer a significant performance boost over Coffee Lake and be more power efficient to boot. Intel would certainly benefit from releasing Ice Lake as early as possible, as its personal-computer customers are likely to appreciate the added performance and features. Intel has cut product lines short in the past to bring out newer, better technologies, so if Ice Lake is ready for a launch in late 2018, I could see Intel going for it. However, Intel's execution when it comes to getting desktop processors out in a timely fashion still leaves much to be desired. Over the past several product generations, Intel has gotten chips out later than the company had previously expected, and the average time between two desktop processor generations is solidly north of a year. It would take some very good execution on Intel's part to keep Ice Lake on track for a 2018 launch, especially because Coffee Lake appears to have been delayed from the second half of 2017 to the first half of 2018. At this point, investors and consumers should just assume that Ice Lake for desktops will launch in 2019. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool recommends Intel.

Chief Executive Officer Masayoshi Son urged the company’s recently acquired chip-designer unit ARM Holdings Plc to make long-term bets on new markets it couldn’t risk exploring when it was a stand-alone company. U.K.-based ARM, whose technology underpins almost all of the more than 1 billion smartphones shipped every year, has support to push ahead with efforts such as attempting to dent Intel Corp.’s domination of the lucrative server chip business and to bring more computing to products like automobiles, Son said Tuesday at a briefing ahead of ARM’s annual technology conference in Santa Clara, California. Son is in the U.S. explaining what ARM can expect from the ownership of the Japan-based communications giant. To get a return on the $32 billion he bet on the chip designer, SoftBank’s biggest acquisition, Son needs its offerings to become as important in a wide range of new markets as they have been in the slowing phone business. “Let me worry about the financial results and believe in the future direction and capability ARM has,” he said. “That’s what I really want ARM to do. Invest more for the future. That’s the key.” Son said his investment is motivated by his belief that computer processing is finally coming to rival the power of the human brain. That means industries such as transportation, health care and finance are going to be fundamentally changed, offering an opportunity for the company that provides the underlying technology. Dominant Rival ARM’s technology, dominant in phones, is increasingly being used in a wide range of devices from washing machines to drones to industrial robots that are being connected to the internet and given processing power. That still hasn’t helped ARM break into in one of the biggest markets for semiconductors: computers. Intel’s products are pervasive in personal computers and server chips, where it has a market share of more than 99 percent. Showing the benefits of its market heft, Intel’s data center division turned $4.5 billion of revenue into $2.1 billion of operating profit in the third quarter. On average, Intel’s peers in the semiconductor industry had an operating margin of less than half of that, at 20 percent, in the most recent quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. ARM Chief Executive Officer Simon Segars is going to invest more in areas where his company hadn’t been spending enough -- such as software development -- to help his customers’ customers make the switch from Intel. ARM provides designs and licenses fundamental technology to companies such as Qualcomm Inc., which uses them to design and produce semiconductors. “That’s exactly the sort of thing that Masa wants us to do -- go invest heavily to grow new business and get more growth later,” Segars said in an interview, referring to Son.

ARM this week is announcing new chip designs typically used for the smallest, lowest-power devices, that contain hardwired security components previously only found in more powerful processors. The designs and software ARM is offering as a service will help customers speed up the introduction of security into chips small enough to fit into something like a medical patch or fitness monitor, he said. “If IoT gets this rap of it being a big security threat, people just aren’t going to adopt it,” said Segars.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Intel's Purley server platform won't use 3D XPoint memory by Eric Born  9:00 AM on October 26, 2016 Intel and Micron have been generating buzz for 3D XPoint, their upcoming non-volatile memory product. Rumors have been swirling about when this technology will be hitting the market. The latest rumor suggets we'll see 3D XPoint powering Optane memory modules before the end of the year. Other implementations of 3D XPoint appear to be delayed, however. In a recent earnings call, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said the new memory won't be a part of its next server platform. In the call, Krzanich says that Intel has been sampling a variety of server products to some of its "leading edge customers." In addition to talking about 3D XPoint, Krzanich mentions omni-path fabric and silicon photonics. However, it appears that 3D XPoint isn't yet ready for the big stage. He said, "there will be a second generation of [Purley Xeons] that includes 3D XPoint." Considering that the second generation of Purley isn't expected until 2018, it'll be a while before Intel ships 3D XPoint DIMMs for its Xeon processors. However, Krzanich did leave the door open for other 3D XPoint products in the meantime. In the conference call, he claims that the new memory will be qualified before the end of 2016. Intel's already shipping samples of 3D XPoint, and is expecting to ramp up production and see revenue growth for the product in 2017. While Intel is being coy about the details, it appears that we can expect to see 3D XPoint arrive in desktop products in 2017, and server products as early as 2018.

Robin Sinha October 26, 2016 7.1k facebook twitter reddit It seems like there's more to Apple's new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus smartphones than meets the eye. For those unaware, the company has launched two versions of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. While some of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus handsets use Qualcomm baseband modems, others feature Intel baseband modems. That can't be a problem, right? BCCL Well, not exactly. According to a new study by Cellular Insights website, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models that have Intel modems are slower than the variants with Qualcomm modems. The website, after extensively testing the two versions of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, came to the conclusion that the new iPhones with Intel's XMM7360 modem consistently performed slower than the iPhones having Qualcomm's MDM9645M modem in terms of LTE throughput. The website further states that on testing LTE performance at different distances from a cell tower, roughly 30% gap was found between the two variants. At their worst, the Intel-based iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus were about 40Mbps slower than their Qualcomm-toting counterparts. BCCL However, it's also mentioned that both variants perform the same in good network conditions. Thus, the test results differ only when there is poor network coverage. It is worth mentioning that the Intel baseband modem-based iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus versions come with GSM/WCDMA/LTE support, while the Qualcomm baseband modem-based variants support GSM/CDMA/WCDMA/TD-SCDMA/LTE connectivity bands. We contacted Apple Support regarding the matter. Apple Support confirmed that the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus that are being sold in India come with Intel baseband modems. AFP The model numbers that are sold in India are A1778 (iPhone 7) and A1784 (iPhone 7 Plus). In the United States, the unlocked iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus sold through Verizon and Sprint have Qualcomm modems. On the other hand, multiple reports claim that carrier-locked devices sold by T-Mobile and AT&T feature Intel modems.

San Francisco, CA, October 26, 2016 --(PR.com)-- CANDI today announced that its PowerTools software has been integrated with the Intel® Building Management Platform (Intel® BMP), which is now available. Intel® BMP is a manageable IoT platform with built-in security that enables cloud-based smart building applications and services with easy access to the data and things in small to mid-sized buildings. CANDI-enabled gateways simplify smart building deployments by making it quick and easy—and often automatic—to integrate smart products such as meters, switches, thermostats, lights, sensors, cameras, and building controls. The PowerTools device and data management platform bridges the most popular building IoT protocols, providing secure and easy access to normalized data through standard APIs. “The IoT is rapidly expanding across industries. In the facilities and energy management markets, robust new solutions for smart buildings such as the Intel® BMP are industry-changers,” said CANDI CEO Steve Raschke. “CANDI PowerTools software provides the bridge between the Intel® BMP and the end applications that make buildings smart and connected. We make it easy to access and use more data from more devices, with a cost-effective, cloud-based solution.” CANDI’s bidirectional edge-to-cloud data services enable an ecosystem of partners to provide comprehensive solutions for energy and facilities management, remote monitoring and control, predictive maintenance, and other compelling smart building applications. Traditionally, the high cost of building management systems (BMS) has been difficult to justify for 90 percent of North America’s commercial buildings that are under 100,000 square feet. But the proliferation of low-cost, advanced IoT technologies and open, cloud-based platforms are transforming building automation technology. Until now, the challenge has been bridging disparate legacy and IoT protocols to make smart building capabilities cost effective and easy to deploy for the small to mid-market. Easy-to-Deploy Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) Platform Accelerates Solution Providers’ Time to Revenue PowerTools software includes easy-to-use discovery and management tools that enable integrators to quickly find and provision hundreds of installed devices to collect data, and bridge systems across a wide and growing range of protocols. The software also provides unique two-way communication capabilities to unlock remote control and management of building systems for cloud-based provisioning, monitoring, and control. This Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform reduces development time and effort for solution providers with a pre-integrated building management platform that helps them quickly deploy, monitor, and maintain data and devices for complete smart building applications. As a result, solution providers can quickly offer exciting new solutions that scale across more sites, reduce cost of deployment, access more data, and deliver new services to new markets.

Anthem health insurance announced last year that nearly 80 million people were affected by the hack on their systems. Gus Ruelas/Reuters | Caption Stolen medical data on the cheap after waves of healthcare hacks Security Buyers and sellers on the digital underground are trading healthcare records databases for as much as $200,000, according to a report from Intel Security. And that's at a discount.  Jeff Stone @jeffstone500 October 26, 2016 —Cybercriminals are selling databases of stolen medical records at a discount perhaps due to a glut of pilfered patient information available on underground web markets, according to a report from Intel Security.  While the report, released Wednesday, underscores the demand for stolen medical records, it also shows how easy it is for criminals to obtain hacked patient information. Medical records, after all, provide digital thieves with a roadmap for stealing someone's identity by including a range of sensitive information that's impossible to change, such as their family medical history. The research should also serve as a warning for medical providers to better secure patient data and defend their systems against cyberattacks, say experts. "As a patient, if I trust you with my medical care, I also need to trust you to protect that information," said Raj Samani, chief technology officer at Intel Security. "You have to trust other people at a certain point but at a certain point we do need to ask, 'What are you doing with my data? ' " On one underground market called the Real Deal, for instance, buyers can purchase information about individuals' insurance companies, Social Security Numbers, and other information for between $14 and $25 per record. A June 2016  report from Dell SecureWorks indicated that individual patient records, known as "fullz" in the underground markets, went for between $15 and $65.  Follow Passcode! Cybersecurity news and analysis delivered straight to your inbox. One database of healthcare records stolen from an unknown provider in Atlanta, Ga., purportedly included information on 397,000 patients for 300 bitcoin (about $200,000). The Intel researchers also found databases that claimed to offer records on 210,000 patients from Oklahoma City, Okla,. and 48,000 patients from Farmington, Mo., for 85 bitcoin ($55,000) and 30 bitcoin ($20,000), respectively. The databases appear to be the  same ones uncovered by Deep Dot Web in June, and their authenticity could not be immediately verified. If the databases are indeed the same, they can be purchased now for a lower rate than in the summer. In June, the Farmington records were priced at 151 bitcoin, the Georgia records at 608 bitcoin, and a database of 210,000 records from a provider in the "Central/Midwest United States," likely Oklahoma, was available for 304 bitcoin. One way to keep criminals from getting access to sensitive medical records is to strengthen authentication systems that protect medical records, said Michael Kaiser, chief executive of the National Cybersecurity Alliance. "The focus on credentials and access to these records needs to be on top of everybody's mind," said Mr. Kaiser. "Organizations need to ask themselves, 'What does it take to access these records from the outside?' Better credentials protect those networks better." Other experts say the government needs to step in to compel healthcare companies to take more steps to safeguard patient data.  "I don't think this is going to slow down until the government puts some sort of measures in place, particularly on the federal side," said Dodi Glenn, vice president of cybersecurity at the security scanning company PC Pitstop, who suggested a security version of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, better known as HIPAA, which aims to protect patients' medical confidentiality. "I don't think I'll see anything like that in my lifetime," he said. "But if there was another magic bullet, we would have used it already." Follow Passcode!

But a whiner is not one of them. Asked on stage today at the Intel Capital Global Summit about the hack of Salesforce board member Colin Powell and the resulting release of the company's highly confidential mergers and acquisition strategy, Benioff was surprisingly upbeat. "On one level, it was great: our investors saw that we run a clean ship. And that our M&A strategy is well thought through." Indeed it is: the 60-page internal presentation showed that Salesforce was looking at 14 possible companies ranging from Adobe (cost: $53.7bn) to automation software company Pegasystems – a steal at just $2.3bn. It was a thoroughly professional job, as you can see for yourself. "We are in somewhat unchartered territory though, when a board member of a public company has his email hacked and board-level strategies are made public documents," Benioff noted. "It's a little uncomfortable." Asked what he was doing in response, he joked: "We're buying fax machines. We see a big opportunity in next-generation fax machines." It's not the only area where the larger-than-life CEO finds conflicts cropping up. Salesforce has managed to protect its hold on the market for customer-facing CRM (customer relationship management) software through a number of smart moves, not least of which was turning its cloud software into a platform and encouraging others to build their applications on top of it. That has occasionally resulted in the odd situation where the company ends up competing with its own customers and sometimes with itself. "It's always an uncomfortable situation," confesses Benioff. His solution? "Our number one thing is to provide a fair playing field." He gives the example of a company Salesforce acquired (SteelBrick), which operated in the same space as one it had invested in. The solution? Point out to the second company that there's plenty of space outside of SteelBrick's specialist field. Benioff also acts as an angel investor in startups and has in the past found himself with shares in a company that Salesforce intends to buy. In one case, he simple gave his shares to the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) before the company bought it. But now, he admitted, he has to run every potential investment past the Salesforce board before he can act. Why UCSF? Because it is one of the many organizations that Benioff has given hundreds of millions of dollars to over the nearly two decades he has been in charge of the CRM juggernaut – you can see his name on the sides of children's hospitals in the Bay Area in return.

Bigelow October 25th, 2016 @bvbigelow @xconomy Like Us Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter LinkedIn Email Reprints Intel Capital has invested $38 million in 12 technology startups since July, highlighting its venture investment focus on innovations in self-driving cars and machine vision, the Internet of Things, sports and health, drones, and virtual reality. The recent funding deals that Intel Capital laid out in San Diego Monday, on the first day of its 17th annual global summit, also reflect the strategic thinking of Wendell Brooks, who took the helm at Intel Capital about a year ago as longtime president Arvind Sodhani retired. Intel Capital is the corporate venture and deal-making arm of Santa Clara, CA-based semiconductor and technology giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC). Brooks joined the division in 2014 after spending 23 years as an investment banker in Europe and the United States, but his strategic vision for the future of digital technology and computing is only now becoming manifest. In an interview last year, for example, Brooks voiced his enthusiasm for investments in automotive-related technologies like advanced driver assist systems and 3-D camera technology—and his interests were reflected in several deals Intel Capital disclosed Monday: —Perrone Robotics, based in Charlottesville, VA, has been developing a software platform for autonomous vehicles and general robotics that founding CEO Paul Perrone said would be to robotics what Windows is to computers and Android is to smartphones. —Embodied, based in Pasadena, CA, and founded by USC computer science professors Paolo Pirjanian (the former iRobot CTO) and Maja Matarić, are developing robots to care for people. —Chronocam, based in Paris, France, has been developing computer vision technology that mimics the biology of the eye for use in self-driving cars and IoT devices. Including the 12 startups highlighted yesterday, an Intel Capital spokesman said his organization has invested $291 million in 31 new companies so far this year, with another $155 million put into 53 follow-on deals (for a total of nearly $447 million). That’s roughly the same investment pace as 2015, when Intel Capital invested a total of $514 million in 63 new companies and 79 follow-on deals. Brooks said he is looking to invest between $400 million and $500 million a year in tech startups that currently lie just beyond the “virtuous cycle of growth,” but whose technologies Intel Capital expects to become more widely adopted in the future. The idea is to invest in startups that are not already part of Intel’s corporate business units, which comprise everything from cloud and data center technologies to the Internet of Things and mobile devices. “We think of the virtuous cycle as the way things are going to work five years from now,” Brooks said in an afternoon keynote address to some 1,100 executives and entrepreneurs who attended the summit. But Brooks said Intel Capital should focus its investments on disruptive technologies that lie just beyond Intel’s core business strategy. “We need to be on a path-finding mission to find tangential investments,” he told reporters. “We’re aligned, but not overlapping, is the way I like to look at it.” In a significant change, Brooks said he wants to … Next Page » Single PageCurrently on Page: 1 2 Bruce V.

Seedstars World, which was won last year by South African mobile recruitment startup Giraffe, held its inaugural Africa Summit in Casablanca, Morocco early this year, and will now hold a second event to connect African entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship ecosystems with the world and each other. The event, for which tickets will go on sale shortly, is supported by Microsoft, Intel, Rwanda’s Ministry of ICT, the kLab incubator, the ICT Chamber of Rwanda, Africa 2.0, and Brussels Airlines. “After four years of hosting competitions across the world and across the African continent, we are more excited than ever about the potential for African entrepreneurs to build global businesses,” said Marcello Schermer, regional manager for Africa at Seedstars World. “We also know that bringing startups, entrepreneurs, investors and ecosystem players together will help increase connections across the continent and accelerate the growth of Africa-born global businesses, and this why we are running Seedstars Africa for the second year in a row.” The Africa Summit will feature speakers such as kLab chief executive officer (CEO) Aphrodice Mutangana, Intel Africa and Middle East director for innovation Hitendra Naik, Rwanda Online CEO Clement Uwajeneza, Microsoft 4Afrika startup engagement lead Djiba Diallo, and Seedstars ambassadors and startups from over 15 African countries. The event will last for three days and culminate with a full-day conference and pitch event bringing together more than 300 startup founders, entrepreneurs, investors, and ecosystem leaders from across Africa. Seedstars World will host a two-day invite-only bootcamp prior to the event, where the winners of the Seedstars local competitions from across Africa will join 20 Rwandan startups to work with mentors on improving their business models, working on their growth strategy and mastering the investor pitch. Winners have already been selected in Egypt, Tunisia, South Africa, Mozambique, Angola, Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Mali, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya, and Senegal, with victorious startups heading to the global final in Switzerland next year. Next up is Algeria on October 29, followed by Zimbabwe on October 30 and Botswana on November 4. This year’s programme will also give entrepreneurs the opportunity to be selected for the Seedstars Growth initiative, which would see startups raise seed investment and enter a four-month accelerator programme for early stage startups.

The new model comes with heavily upgraded performance, a thinner and lighter design and a unique capacitive touch strip above the keyboard called the Touch Bar. The new MacBook Pro is long overdue. Apple's neglect of its high-end PCs hasn't gone unnoticed by customers and critics. Today, the company caught up with its Windows-powered rivals, launching a new range of laptops with sixth-generation Intel Core processors and up to 2.3 times greater graphics performance than the previous MacBook Pro. As rumoured this summer, Apple has created a new kind of interface to headline the MacBook Pro's spec sheet. In place of the function keys above the keyboard, the laptop sports a Retina multi-touch secondary display. The "Touch Bar" is contextually aware and provides one-touch access to controls in open apps. Apple MacBook Pro (2016) Apple Touch Bar is integrated into many of Apple's built-in apps including Mail, Finder, Calendar and Numbers. In Safari, it can show open tabs and favourites, letting you switch view without reaching for the touchpad. In Messages, the Touch Bar becomes an emoji strip. Alternatively, in Photos, Touch Bar lets you scroll through thumbnails and edit images from a regular typing position. Third-party developers will also be able to access the Touch Bar. Apple has improved the MacBook Pro's primary display too. Available in 13-inch or 15-inch form, the Retina panel is up to 67 percent brighter than the outgoing model. It benefits from new power-saving technologies that reduce overall consumption by up to 30 percent, leading to a longer battery life. Apple MacBook Pro (2016) Apple Apple has managed to make the laptop up to 17 percent thinner at just 14.9mm on the 13-inch model. Despite the reduction in interior space, the MacBook Pro is now more powerful than ever. It's available with processors up to Intel's sixth-generation quad-core Core i7 chips with discrete AMD Radeon Pro graphics. Every model features an SSD with sequential read speeds greater than 3GBps. There's also support for biometric authentication via Apple's Touch ID fingerprint sensors, making an appearance on Mac for the first time. It can be used to login to Mac OS and compatible websites in Safari. Alongside the headline features, Apple has also improved the laptop's speakers, keyboard and touchpad. Apple says the MacBook's sound now has double the dynamic range and additional bass. The touchpad is 46 percent larger on the 13-inch model, rising to 50 percent larger on the 15-inch version. Apple MacBook Pro (2016) Apple The launch of the new MacBook Pro comes during the 25th anniversary week of the first Apple notebook PC. After letting the line stagnate for a while, the release marks a significant improvement in the premium laptop's capabilities. With the Touch Bar, Apple has brought something new to the traditional laptop form factor, introducing a new kind of input device that replaces the function keys with media playback controls, quick access shortcuts and bookmark links. It's likely to be more useful to typical consumers than the typical F1-F12, although not everyone will appreciate the change. "This week marks the 25th anniversary of Apple’s first notebook; through the years each generation has introduced new innovations and capabilities, and it’s fitting that this all-new generation of MacBook Pro is the biggest leap forward yet," said Phil Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. Apple MacBook Pro (2016) Apple "With the groundbreaking new Touch Bar, the convenience of Touch ID, the best Mac display ever, powerful performance, improved audio, blazing-fast storage and Thunderbolt 3 connectivity in our thinnest and lightest pro notebook yet, the new MacBook Pro is the most advanced notebook ever made." The baseline 13-inch MacBook Pro with a dual-core 2.0GHz Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of memory and 256GB of storage starts at $1,499 and is available to purchase today. A faster model, with a 2.9GHz Core i5 processor, will start shipping in 2-3 weeks. Finally, the 15-inch Core i7 version can be pre-ordered today for shipping within the next month. All models can be purchased from Apple's website at Apple.com.

With each generational update, Apple has redefined what the notebook can do, and tonight as Tim Cook said, Apple did it again. We have among ourselves a new generation of the MacBook Pro. A new design makes the new MacBook Pro the thinnest and lightest MacBook pro ever. The 13-inch Macbook Pro is 23 per cent smaller in volume and weighs half a pound less than the previous version. The 15-inch Pro is just 15.5 mm thin, 14 per cent thinner and 20 per cent smaller in volume than the previous variant and weighs just 4 pounds. And that makes the new MacBooks thinner than even the MacBook air. The new MacBook Pro comes with an all new ForceTouch track pad which is also two times larger and comes with a capacitive glass surface and its own Taptic engine. The keyboard also comes with a new Butterfly mechanism. As for the Function keys, Apple thinks they are now obsolete and went ahead and replaced them with a customizable mini Retina display. It is multi-touch and responds to gestures. Apple calls it, the Touch Bar. All system settings are now easily accessible. Brightness volume and playback controls are now just a tap and a slide away. Open Safari and the Touch Bar refreshes to pop up your favorite websites. Open the Photos app, the Touch Bar shows you settings to tweak the photo. Start typing and word suggestions will pop up. The Touch Bar is a chameleon in disguise. Opening a new app transforms the Touch Bar with application specific shortcuts. Formatting controls, word suggestions based on how you communicate, and even emojis will pop up on the Touch Bar when you are typing. Use the Touch Bar to scroll through your photos. Rewind and fast forward and preview videos. Edit your photos using radial controls. The Touch Bar can be customized with your favorite system controls, apps and settings. As for the display, Apple has upgraded the display on the MacBook Pro with the brightest ever screen seen in the notebooks. It is now 67 per cent brighter, has 67 per cent higher contrast ratio and 25 per cent wider color gamut. On the inside, the new 15-inch MacBook Pro features a sixth generation Intel Core i7 clocked at 2.6Ghz processor with AMD Polaris Radeon Pro 450 graphics with 4GB VRAM, 16GB of RAM and a superfast 256GB SSD with a speed of 3.1GB/s which can be expanded up to 2TB. The hardware inside is cooled down with a new thermal architecture which Apple claims disposes heat more efficiently and quietly. There is also a new dynamic range, high-fidelity, room-filling speaker. The 13-inch MacBook Pro comes with a sixth generation Intel Core i5 clocked at 2.9GHz, Intel Iris Graphics which is two times faster, 8GB of RAM and a new superfast 256GB SSD which is also two times faster than the previous generation. Apple also unveiled a base model for the 13-inch MacBook Pro that retains the Function keys and comes with sixth-generation Intel i5 processor clocked at 2.0GHz, 8GB of RAM, 256GB of SSD storage and two Thunderbolt 3 ports. And also, it seems with the 13-inch base model, Apple has rested the 13-inch MacBook Air which has now been rendered redundant after what Apple did to the dimensions of the new MacBook Pro. However, Apple retained the 12-inch original MacBook in the new lineup. Beside the Touch Bar is the Touch ID which is integrated into the power button. It is the second generation TouchID sensor made from sapphire crystal. Rest your finger on the TouchID panel and you're in your MacBook in an instant. It is powered by the new Apple T1 Chip which enables contactless payment through Apple Pay straight from the MacBook pro. The TouchID can also remember and recognize your fingerprint. If someone else who has their fingerprint saved, a tap on the TouchID will quickly switch to his profile, in a snap. The MacBook comes with four Thunderbolt 3 ports that can used for connecting just about anything. The ports also double up as USB Type-C ports which enables charging the MacBook Pro using any of the four ports. You can connect up to two 5K displays. There's HDMI and VGA input/output and USB. Also, the headphone jack has been retained. Apple wasted no time to show how creators including Photoshop users, FinalCut Pro users, and even DJ apps like the DJ Pro, can embrace the power of the new Touch Bar in the MacBook Pro and frankly, it's exciting how easy it makes handling operations with it. Even Microsoft's Office Suite will offer complete support for the Touch Bar. The MacBook runs on the new macOS Sierra and offers up to 10 hours of battery life. The new MacBook Pros come in two color variants- Space Grey and Silver. Unfortunately no Jet Black variant. And this pitches the MacBook Pro directly against the Surface devices, which Microsoft took a lot of pain to position for the creators and designers. The 13-inch base model costs $1499 (roughly Rs 1,00,250) and will start shipping in the US from tonight. The other 13-inch and the 15-inch MacBook Pro are priced at $1799 (roughly Rs 1,20,350) and $2399 (Rs 1,60,450). The 13-inch and the 15-inch are up for pre-orders starting today and will ship in 2-3 weeks.

The new MacBook Pro features Apple’s brightest and most colorful Retina display yet, the security and convenience of Touch ID®, a more responsive keyboard, a larger Force Touch trackpad and an audio system with double the dynamic range. It’s also the most powerful MacBook Pro ever, featuring sixth-generation quad-core and dual-core processors, up to 2.3 times the graphics performance over the previous generation, super-fast SSDs and up to four Thunderbolt 3 ports. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161027006595/en/ The Touch Bar places controls right at the user’s fingertips and adapts when using the system or apps like Mail, Finder®, Calendar, Numbers®, GarageBand®, Final Cut Pro® X and many more, including third-party apps. For example, the Touch Bar can show Tabs and Favorites in Safari®, enable easy access to emoji in Messages, provide a simple way to edit images or scrub through videos in Photos and so much more. “This week marks the 25th anniversary of Apple’s first notebook; through the years each generation has introduced new innovations and capabilities, and it’s fitting that this all-new generation of MacBook Pro is the biggest leap forward yet,” said Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. “With the groundbreaking new Touch Bar, the convenience of Touch ID, the best Mac display ever, powerful performance, improved audio, blazing fast storage and Thunderbolt 3 connectivity in our thinnest and lightest pro notebook yet, the new MacBook Pro is the most advanced notebook ever made.” Thinnest and Lightest MacBook Pro Ever Building on innovations pioneered in MacBook®, the new MacBook Pro features an entirely new enclosure design and all-metal unibody construction that creates an incredibly rigid and dense notebook that is amazingly thin and light. At just 14.9 mm thin, the 13-inch MacBook Pro is 17 percent thinner and 23 percent less volume than the previous generation, and nearly half a pound lighter at just three pounds. The new 15-inch MacBook Pro, at just 15.5 mm thin, is 14 percent thinner and 20 percent less volume than before, and weighing just four pounds, is nearly half a pound lighter. Touch ID Comes to the Mac Integrated into the power button is the convenience and security of Touch ID, one of the great features customers have come to know and love from their iPhone® and iPad®. Once you enroll your fingerprint in Touch ID on your MacBook Pro, you can quickly unlock your Mac®, switch user accounts and make secure purchases with Apple Pay® on the web with a single touch. Touch ID enables a quick, accurate reading of your fingerprint and uses sophisticated algorithms to recognize and match it with the Secure Enclave in the new Apple T1 chip. Apple’s Brightest, Most Colorful Notebook Display The best Mac display ever delivers images that are more vivid, reveal even greater detail and appear more lifelike than ever. As thin as a MacBook display at .88 mm, the Retina display on the new MacBook Pro at 500 nits of brightness, is an amazing 67 percent brighter than the previous generation, features 67 percent more contrast and is the first Mac notebook display to support a wider color gamut. And with power-saving technologies like a larger pixel aperture, a variable refresh rate and more power-efficient LEDs, the display consumes 30 percent less energy than before. The Most Powerful MacBook Pro Yet Powerful processors, cutting-edge graphics, blazing-fast SSDs, high-speed memory and an advanced thermal architecture deliver amazing pro-level performance in a dramatically thinner enclosure. Sixth-generation dual-core Core i5 with eDRAM, dual-core Core i7 with eDRAM and quad-core Core i7 Intel processors deliver pro-level processing performance while conserving energy. The new 15-inch MacBook Pro features powerful Radeon Pro discrete graphics delivering up to 2.3 times more performance than the previous generation; while the 13-inch MacBook Pro comes with Intel Iris Graphics that are up to two times faster than before. All models feature SSDs with sequential read speeds over 3GBps and Thunderbolt 3 which consolidates data transfer, charging and twice the video bandwidth in a single port — allowing users to drive a 5K display and power their MacBook Pro with a single cable. The New MacBook Pro Also Offers: • Much larger Force Touch trackpads — 46 percent larger on the 13-inch MacBook Pro and twice as large on the 15-inch MacBook Pro; • More responsive and comfortable typing on the keyboard with a second-generation butterfly mechanism; • Louder, more true-to-life sound through speakers with double the dynamic range and improved bass; • macOS™ Sierra, the world’s most advanced desktop operating system, with new features like Siri® integration, Universal Clipboard, Apple Pay on the web and Photos, which helps you rediscover your meaningful memories, organize your library and perfect shots like a pro.

Also, references within El Capitan’s code suggest a new machine could be in the works, which would enable the company to benefit from the last two years of processor advances. The chips could also go through a change and Apple might have to choose between Skylake and E5 V4 Broadwell chips. Coming to the MacBook Air, there might be some bad news. Apple may be considering retiring the Air. Also, the Mac mini missed out on being updated in 2015 users can hope to see a 2016 update to the machine that is currently using Haswell processors.

The Ideapad Y900 is an attempt by one of the most successful notebook vendors to venture into the high-end mobile gaming market, and I have to say, at first glance, they have done a nice job. The Ideapad Y900 doesn't only have very nice specifications, but it also carries many other technologies to compete with competitors with the same specifications.     A Turbo slider-button brings back memories of the old days when you would hit the turbo button on your desktop to gain a few megahertz. G-Sync ensures solid graphics output to the 17" panel, and Killer's DoubtShot Duo allows you to team your wireless and wired connections for extra network bandwidth.   The keyboard also uses mechanical keys, which is unique for a notebook, but something gamers will appreciate. Speaker placement has also been optimized to provide a solid experience without headphones. Venture with me as I take a close look at the Lenovo Ideapad Y900.     Specifications     The Ideapad Y900 uses an Intel i7-6820HK quad-core / eight-thread CPU with a base speed of 2.8GHz and a Turbo up to 3.6GHz. Using Lenovo's built-in Turbo button, you can increase that to 4.1GHz. The notebook comes with a 17.3" FHD (1920x1080) IPS Anti-Glare LED panel that supports NVIDIA G-Sync. A NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980M 8GB variant powers the panel. The unit I got comes with 16GB of DDR4 at 2133MHz, a 1TB HDD, and a 256GB M.2 SSD.     The Ideapad Y900 uses a 230W adapter. You get a 6-cell 90Wh battery that should last up to five hours. The notebook uses two JBL speakers and a 3W subwoofer, comes with a 720p HD web camera, and uses a Killer Wireless AC NIC. Dimensions are 425x315x36(WxDxH), and it weighs in around 4.6KG. It's not light nor small, but it packs some very nice gaming hardware.     Pricing   The Ideapad Y900 comes in different configurations, with the base costing $2500.

"The centre will enable research institutions and academia to test their applications on our high performance computing platform as a service with Intel technologies for early adoption," said HPE India Director Vikram K on Thursday. Customers can access the platform even remotely through a cloud-driven model, which can be replicated in their data centres. Indian research institutions and academia use high performance computing for big data analytics and simulations of complex processes and in large projects. "High performance computing will play a major role in the government's proposed National Supercomputing Mission, which will create a grid of 70 supercomputers, connecting academic and research institutions across the country for developing applications of national use," Vikram told reporters here on the occasion. The HPE-Intel centre will also train new users and enable developers to hone their ability to leverage parallelism and vectorisation in Intel's central processing units. "There is a need in research and academic institutions for computational power to process large volumes of data, solve complex mathematical problems and repeat calculations for multiplicative situations," asserted Vikram. With Intel technology and HPE's systems and services, the centre will also allow customers to validate their applications and achieve optimised system performance and scale," added Intel Regional Manager Ravi Gupta. --IANS fb/pgh/dg SEARCH About Us Data Center Cloud Computing Servers Cloud Applications Hosting MPLS VPN Network Services Disclaimer Privacy Policy Careers Feedback Advertise Digital © Copyright Sify Technologies Ltd, 1998-2016.

Yeah right Bristol AI chip upstart Graphcore scores $30m in VC dosh Uber drivers entitled to UK minimum wage, London tribunal rules The best way of protecting us from Internet of Things botnets is to compartmentalise the entire internet, Intel’s chief architect for IoT security solutions has said. Sven Schrecker, speaking exclusively to The Register at IoT Solutions World Congress in Barcelona, also branded the potential impact of IoT botnets as ‘“devastating”, warning that the Krebs website attack was just the tip of the iceberg. So far IoT botnet miscreants have employed “quiet exploitation followed by loud exploits,” Schrecker said. “They’re just making it difficult for internet services to function.” If the operators behind these IoT-enabled botnets were to “point them at industry” instead of smaller targets such as individual journalists’ websites, as happened with infosec researcher Brian Krebs, the impact on the world economy could be “devastating”, he added. The recent high-profile IoT botnet DDoS attacks have, so far, avoided using traditional traffic amplification techniques such as DNS reflection because consumer-grade IoT devices are so easily hacked en masse. This makes it much harder for DDoS mitigation services to cope, as was seen when Akamai threw Krebs off its network with two hours’ notice. An attack against infrastructure would quickly harden legislators’ attitudes towards the IoT, Schrecker warned, giving them a “very strong will to alter” existing light touch governmental security mandates. Is self-regulation an option before the same sharp minds that gave us the EU cookie directive omnishambles set their sights on the IoT? Schrecker was quietly confident, though he hedged his bets: “We have the makings of a standard for IIOT [Industrial Internet of Things, the new-fangled term for what used to be called M2M]. If that works, it can go to IoT. Setting standards is not a quick process but consolidated industry opinion saying the same thing, that’s much more strengthened.” As for coping with the threat we face now, courtesy of millions of pathetically insecure consumer IoT devices, Schrecker’s proposed solution sounds elegantly simple, in theory at least: “Distribute, for example, gateways. Edge gateways that can contain a DDoS and are smart enough to talk to each other and help contain them that way.” Gateways “can then be updated” in lieu of individual device owner-operators having to do it themselves, “defeat vulnerabilities, contain botnets, and even notify owner-operators.” Again, it sounds great on paper. As Schrecker warned, however, until there’s a major IoT DDoS that affects something people care about - financial services rather than cloud-based pet-feeding apps - there’ll be no public will to harpoon the Moby Dick that is IoT security. ® Sponsored: Transforming software delivery with DevOps Tips and corrections 34 Comments More from The Register SpamTorte botnet gets turbo-charged Revamped version speeds junk mail attacks 5 Comments Mirai IoT botnet blamed for 'smashing Liberia off the internet' Entire country gets to enjoy life without the web thanks to huge DDoS attack, it is claimed 9 Comments A successor to Mirai?

What does it mean for Samsung and who could benefit from the fallout? Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Oct 27, 2016 at 7:38AM Beyond Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF), the Galaxy Note 7's discontinuation will help and hurt other players throughout the smartphone industry, including chip manufacturers and other suppliers. In this clip from Industry Focus: Tech, Motley Fool analysts Dylan Lewis and Evan Niu, CFA, discuss who stands to win and who stands to lose.  A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Oct. 14, 2016. Dylan Lewis: Evan, we talked about how the premium side of the smartphone market could see some shake-up. We might see some consumers that were interested in the Galaxy line, maybe they were Galaxy Note owners, taking this opportunity to either try an iOS device, maybe another Android device. Do you think there are any big beneficiaries with this? Evan Niu: I think there are definitely some winners and losers. If we start with the loser list, I think it's a little bit shorter, because Samsung is mostly self-contained in terms of its suppliers. Samsung is so directly integrated that it makes most of the components that go to its phones. It still has some third-party part suppliers. But as far as supply relationships go that might suffer from reduced unit volumes, it's mostly going to be within Samsung itself. Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) probably loses a little bit because the Snapdragon 820 is inside the U.S. variants... Lewis: Can you explain what the Snapdragon does? Niu: Snapdragon is the main applications processor that has integrated modem and all these things. It's one of the most part and pieces of any phone, the processor. Samsung, what they do is they have all these different variants for different geographies. Samsung has been trying to ship to its own in-house Exynos processor. I think the last year, they were exclusively Exynos, with no Snapdragon, but this year, Qualcomm has gotten back into the mix, they've improved their chips a little bit and got more competitive. There's some variance for different geographies, and Qualcomm is in the U.S. variance. So, they'll lose a little bit, since they obviously won't be selling into this phone anymore. But there's kind of a hedge, because Qualcomm does sell a lot into Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). If people buy iPhones instead of the Note 7, probably incrementally negative to Qualcomm, but they're not totally out of the picture. Lewis: Right, you might be a little pinched, but nothing crazy. Niu: Right, there's a little bit of a hedge, there's a silver lining. And of course, it depends on which iPhone you get, because not Qualcomm has lost a little bit of spot in the iPhone, because Qualcomm used to be the exclusive modem supplier, and for the first time ever, Apple has gone to Intel -- well, first time not including Infineon 10 years ago. Now, this year, Apple is now buying modems from Qualcomm and Intel, depending on which phone you get. As far as pure winners, I would say certainly Apple. Lewis: Yeah, I think they're up 10% since some of the products issues around the Note 7 surfaced. The market certainly seems to think... Niu: Yeah, there was already iPhone 7 optimism, and now the shares just keep going higher. They're at 2016 highs because of all this stuff that's going on with Samsung. I think it's pretty clear that a lot of people are probably going to try. And we've already been seeing Android switching rates continue to rise every quarter. Apple touts this every quarter, every quarter they're like, "Highest Android switcher rates ever." I think that trend is going to continue, particularly with one of the biggest Android OEMs hitting into this wall here. As mentioned, Intel is now in some of the iPhones. So Intel, to the extent that people are buying the phones with their modem, they benefit. Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), I think, is a big winner here too. They actually just released earnings that were pretty strong. Taiwan semiconductor is producing Apple's A10 Fusion chip. Another change this year is that, in prior years, Apple had been dual sourcing its chip manufacturing from both Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor, which started one or two years ago. They only brought on Taiwan semiconductor one or two years ago. But now, supposedly, with all the indications that we're getting, it's exclusively to TSMC, which is a huge win for them and a huge blow to Samsung, in terms of the foundry business on the chip manufacturing side. That's a lot more chips that Taiwan Semi is going to be making for Apple. They just released earnings, it was pretty strong, came in above expectations. I don't remember the exact numbers. But the important thing is that Taiwan Semiconductor raised fourth quarter guidance, and that raised guidance did not factor in the possibility of these other phones being discontinued. So they were already super bullish, even before factoring in the Note 7's discontinuation into their forecast. So, I think they're really going to bank this holiday quarter if Apple sells enough phones. That's a ton of orders going to TSMC to make these A10 Fusion chips. I think they're probably a pretty big winner here. Lewis: Yeah, I think a lot of people tend to read into the commentary we get from component manufacturers that go into the iPhone as a general baseline for how that segment might be doing when Apple reports again. If you're seeing guidance up from Taiwan Semiconductor, that probably bodes well for the iPhone business. Niu: Yeah. And even before the Samsung Note -- that's what blew me away -- their guidance was so strong, and they literally said, "This does not include any impact if the Note 7 is discontinued," which it has been. So, it looks really good for them. As far as third-party carriers or retailers are concerned, I think they're pretty ambivalent. They're just trying to do their best to help their customers not be in danger. Their brands aren't going to be affected, and they're not going to be bearing a lot of cost because Samsung is going to be paying for all of this. So most of the retailers and carriers just want to do what's right for the customer and get these things off the market. I don't think there's going to be any damage to them.

Eyes Above The Waves Robert O'Callahan. Christian. Repatriate Kiwi. Hacker. Thursday, 27 October 2016 Implications Of ASLR Side-Channel Attacks This paper is a pretty interesting attack on kernel ASLR, based on observing timing differences in (invalid) accesses to kernel memory from user-space with Intel's TSX hardware transactional memory primitives. There is other recent work on kernel ASLR information leaks based on cache timing and BTB timing. I was a bit underwhelmed by the BTB attacks but this TSX-based attack is much stronger. My guess is that there are a lot more timing-channel and other side-channel attacks to be discovered under this thread model. While I was at Berkeley, I was quite stunned to hear that Intel's SGX enclave extension was designed for a threat model that explicitly excludes side-channel attacks! This all reminds me of the wave of CFI bypass attacks. CFI and ASLR are supposed to reduce exploitability of bugs providing attack primitives like buffer overflows, but in the long run, they may not be much good. This increases the importance of denying attackers access to these primitives in the first place. Programming languages that reduce the TCB are an important part of that. Glad to be writing most of our new code in Rust! Tangentially, I wonder whether the publication of the TSX-timing-channel paper was a good thing overall (other than for the careers of the researchers), given the paper's conclusion that there are no practical countermeasures without hardware changes or significant performance degradation ... not even a microcode update to disable TSX is available. Ostensibly the value of attack papers, like white-hat security analysis, is to stimulate the creation and deployment of defensive countermeasures, but in this case there really aren't any. Would we all be better off, in practice, if the issue had been reported to hardware vendors and silently fixed, with microcode updates available for older hardware, before publication? Like Andrew Myers, I feel that the incentives to favour attack research over defense mean we're spending a lot of public money to mostly make the security situation worse.

Price $420 AUD > Pricing info Specs LGA 1151 (Skylake) • DDR4-3400+ • 2 x M.2 • U.2, 6x SATA • Intel LAN • metal backplate, PCI and DIMM reinforcement Tweet Email this Print this Feedback Value and features in this season’s mobo-silver. Black and red is so 2015. This season’s mothertboard colours are lighter, and perhaps, like this one, metallic. There’s no doubt that MSI’s new Z170A Mpower Gaming Titanium looks the bomb. Every part of it is coated with a silvery white metallic substance, and that look is enhanced with metal reinforcement of the PCI and DIMM slots, and a full-sized slab of metal that covers the back of the motherboard. The Z170A Mpower Gaming Titanium sits just below MSI’s similarly-styled and specced Z170A Xpower board, with the main feature difference being a loss of the Xpower’s included SATA-Express ports, but seeing as that standard is effectively a dead duck there’s no real loss, and for the saving of around $50 we consider it a double win. I chose this board to build a new PC to use as my daily work machine and occasional reviews testbed. Part of the appeal is its 11-phase CPU VRM, as I’m using a K-series CPU and every bit of OC capability is welcome. This board’s strong point is connectivity. For SSDs, you get a pair of M.2 interfaces as well as another U.2 port, plus six standard SATA ports. That’s all the future-proofing I need for adding in next-gen SSDs over time, and testing them for PC&TA. Seven USB 3.0 ports and a pair of USB 3.1 ports (one Type-A and one Type-C) are included too, so it’s especially generous for high speed connectivity. At around $420 it sits against the Asus ROG line and the higher end of Gigabyte’s Gaming range. Most importantly, it’s cheaper than the aforementioned MSI Xpower, yet has all the important features of that high-end product but with the same appealing aesthetics. For a new Skylake build that looks a bit different and doesn’t compromise of ports and storage connectivity it’s one very nice board to base a new system on.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 26, 2016 at 8:06PM In 2015, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) talked up a new type of memory technology that it had developed jointly with memory specialist Micron, known as 3D XPoint. In a nutshell, 3D XPoint is pitched as a memory technology that's supposed to sit in between traditional DRAM and NAND flash in terms of speed, endurance, and cost. A wafer of 3D XPoint chips. Image source: Micron.  Although it's not quite clear how large the market opportunity for this technology is, investors are likely to begin to find out next year as the company begins production shipments of the technology. 3D XPoint to ramp in 2017 According to Intel CEO Brian Krzanich on the company's most recent earnings call, the company plans to "ship thousands of [3D XPoint] samples to customers" as the current quarter progresses. He also said Intel is aiming to qualify 3D XPoint for production "at the end of the quarter." Once the technology is qualified for production, the company aims to ramp up production of 3D XPoint throughout 2017, which is when investors should expect to see revenue from the product flowing into the company's top and bottom lines. 3D XPoint SSDs first, memory modules later During the call, Krzanich made clear that Intel's upcoming Purley server platform won't feature support for 3D XPoint memory modules (in other words, substitutes for traditional DRAM) at the outset -- that support is now expected to come with the company's second-generation processor family on the Purley platform. The earliest that investors should expect such memory modules is sometime in 2018. It's important to understand, however, that this doesn't mean Intel won't be selling 3D XPoint into the server market throughout 2017. It simply means that the first server-bound 3D XPoint products will be storage drives just like today's NAND-flash-based solid-state drives, just way faster. If 3D XPoint delivers what Intel claims it delivers, then there could be a significant revenue opportunity just from storage drives based on the technology. However, what Intel seems to be more excited about is the prospect of selling memory modules based on this technology to stand in for traditional DRAM. Memory module opportunity likely more interesting to Intel I suspect that sales of 3D XPoint-based storage drives will, to some degree, eat into sales of traditional solid-state drives. Intel sells such drives, so to the extent that a 3D XPoint storage device is sold in place of a traditional solid-state drive, Intel may not always come out ahead. Memory modules are a whole different ballgame, however. Every 3D XPoint memory module that Intel sells would presumably be in place of a traditional DRAM-based memory module. Today, Intel doesn't manufacture or sell DRAM products, so to the extent that 3D XPoint can be substituted in for DRAM, Intel stands to enjoy revenue upside. Image source: Intel, via KitGuru.  It goes beyond near-term revenue, though. Intel currently commands nearly the entirety of the server processor market, and it would obviously like to keep as much of that share as possible, even as many chip competitors try to rip away market share. Should these 3D XPoint memory modules prove to offer a real and compelling value proposition to data-center operators, and should those memory modules work only with Intel's processors, they could be instrumental to helping Intel maintain extremely high server processor market share. Considering how much Intel has riding on its ability to maintain a strong position in the server market, it's little surprise that the company would be interested in developing compelling complementary platform technologies that only work with its platforms.

Contain yourself, and your data 26 Oct 2016 at 23:27, Thomas Claburn Thomas Claburn Get email alert when this author posts Common Topics Software Recent Articles DMCA updated – toaster penetration testing gets green light in America No nudes, bloated apps, Android sucks and 497 other complaints about Apple to the FTC CIA will put records online The Indexed Database API 2.0 has arrived in draft form, promising a variety of improvements in the way developers of web applications can store data in browsers. IndexedDB is a JavaScript-based object-oriented database within modern browsers. It began taking shape in 2011 and, after years in draft form, it met with W3C approval last year. It's particularly useful for web applications that need to store large amounts of data to function offline, and for Progressive Web Apps. Now there's a second version under consideration. IndexedDB is one of several client-side storage options for web apps. Other options include: Cookies, which are limited in size and data type, and don't support recent APIs like Web Workers. DOM Storage, which has similar limitations. WebSQL, a one-time challenger that has been deprecated. AppCache, characterized as a "douchebag" for being difficult to use. The Cache API, intended for URL-addressable resources and not available in all browsers. The File API, which isn't yet fully baked. The Chrome-only FileSystem API. Unlike Cookies and DOM Storage, IndexedDB works asynchronously, so its operations do not block other operations while active. Although broad support for IndexedDB has been slow in coming – Apple just recently implemented full support in Safari 10 – it's now a worthy choice for storing significant amounts of structured data in the browser. In a blog post on Tuesday, Bevis Tseng, a platform engineer at Mozilla, highlighted some of the new capabilities coming to IndexedDB in Firefox 51, available for developers now and scheduled for the general public in January 2017. The IndexedDB API 2.0 offers a setter to rename existing object stores and indexes, via IDBObjectStore.name and IDBIndex.name. It also provides a way to listen for storage change events through the IDBDatabase.onclose() event handler. The updated API also adds support for binary data types as index keys. "Now you can have binary signatures as keys directly, without serializing them into strings or array objects as required by the previous API version," explained Tseng. And a variety of other methods have been added that improve how database keys can be accessed, such as IDBObjectStore.getKey(query), IDBObjectStore.openKeyCursor(range, direction),and getAll/getAllKeys(range, count). IndexedDB doesn't yet support JavaScript Promises – a way to deal with events that may succeed or fail while running asynchronous code – but there's a proposal and there are libraries that provide support. For those who have to store client-side data in web apps, IndexedDB is worth a look. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 2 Comments More from The Register Mozilla wants woeful WoSign certs off the list Backdating SHA-1 certs is just not on 23 Comments Mozilla emits JavaScript debugger for Firefox and Chrome When it's easier to rewrite than refactor 7 Comments Mozilla plots TLS 1.3 future for Firefox Quicker handshake starts encrypting data sooner 7 Comments Mozilla's trying on seven hot new spring/summer logo looks LOGOWATCH Poll Seven new logo candidates run from Monsters Inc to completely mad 48 Comments Mozilla will patch zero-day Firefox bug to fizzle man-in-the-middle diddle Cert-pinning cockup can be exploited to identify Tor users What do Tor, Tails and Caddy have in common?

(AP Photo/Richard Drew) Share Written by Dave Gershgorn October 26, 2016 For a firm that makes most of its money selling software and cloud services, Microsoft sure wants to look like a hardware company. Alongside new features for Windows 10, Microsoft execs spent more than an hour of the company’s event on Oct. 26 pitching new computers, VR headsets, and accessories focused on artists and designers. When it comes to Microsoft’s bottom line, hardware sales are just a drop in the bucket. And while niche-targeted products like creative-friendly desktops are unlikely to change that, new hardware puts the company right next to Apple in the headlines. They also paint a clear picture of the message Microsoft wants investors and consumers to hear: Macs are over, and PCs are once again for creative types. In a hardware landscape that has users living in fear of which port Apple will nix next, the strategy just might work. Surface Studio Today’s largest announcement was a 28″ 4K desktop PC called the Surface Studio. The Studio looks a lot like an angular iMac, except the computer’s touchscreen can swing down to rest on the desk at a 20-degree angle, which lets it function as a drawing tablet. The Studio screen works with the Surface Pen, as well as the new Surface Dial, a little knob that either sits alongside the computer to scroll through pen strokes or can be placed on the screen to bring up additional menus. Microsoft’s Surface Studio and Dial (Quartz/ Dave Gershgorn) Combined with a Pen and a Dial, Microsoft says Surface Studio is the best computer on the market for creative tasks. It’s being pitched at artists, architects, engineers, and anyone else who currently creates on the PC (or rather, anyone who makes a lot of money creating things on a PC, because the Studio starts at $2999). For that price, you’ll get an Intel i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 2GB Nvidia GPU. For Microsoft’s most powerful machine—Intel i7 processor, 32GB of RAM, and 4GB GPU—you’ll have to shell out $4199. The Studios are available in limited quantities for pre-order, and will ship in mid-December. Let’s be honest: Nobody is buying this computer for its specs. It’s a beautiful machine that just might be functional, and it natively works with a stylus and navigation dial. Microsoft also announced an update to the Surface Book, which costs $2300 for increased battery life and 2x speed. Windows 10 Creators Edition It looks like Windows 10 really is the last version of Windows. Instead of dealing with hassle of a new software launch, Microsoft is releasing a free update to the world’s most popular operating system, dubbed the Creators Edition. It will be officially available in the spring, but beta releases are coming as early as next week. The update contains two big changes worth noting: a messaging overhaul, and 3D everything. With messaging, Microsoft has chosen to put people first in their redesign. Instead of opening an email client or Skype, you’ll be able to pin individual people to the bottom taskbar. Clicking on them will bring up your preferred method of communicating with that person, making it easy to maintain multiple conversations and to quickly send files. Microsoft clearly has seen the success of Apple’s iMessage, and is also trying to imitate that. The Windows 10 update includes a new message-relay system that allows users to answer text messages from their Android or Windows phone, as Mac users can with iMessage. The update also gives a classic Windows program, Paint, a whole new look and skillset. The software, now named Paint 3D, will be able to create and manipulate 3D models, and integrate seamlessly with online repositories of models. Powerpoint will also be able to import 3D models, and transitions between slides can rotate and zoom to show different aspects of objects. This honestly looks pretty silly right now, and doesn’t make a lot of sense until you think about Microsoft’s long-term master plan: to lead the pack in VR and AR. Microsoft’s multiple realities The VR duopoly—a showdown between Oculus and Vive—is about to end. HP, Dell, Lenovo, Asus, and Acer will all begin producing VR headsets that don’t require any kind of exterior sensor to function, called inside-out positional tracking. All new headsets should have positional tracking. (Quartz/ Dave Gershgorn) One unspecified headset was shown on stage today, in a demo where a model created in Paint 3D was brought into a virtual room. Microsoft seems to imagine each user having a personal room or set of rooms, analogous to a desktop. In the demo, soccer played on one wall, while apps were located on another alongside a shelf of digital toys. The 3D models also can be viewed through the HoloLens, which was briefly trotted out on stage but not given much time. Microsoft did not announce any expected release dates for the VR headsets, nor did they give additional information about a consumer HoloLens release.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Intel P3100 M.2 SSD has datacenters in mind by Eric Frederiksen  3:22 PM on October 26, 2016 When it comes to datacenters, not all storage is created equal. Datacenters move more data around in an hour than most of us will in a lifetime, and they need storage that can handle that. SSDs are already in wide use in datacenters, but the M.2 form factor isn't widely adopted yet. Intel wants to help with that, and it's giving businesses an M.2 option in the form of the P3100 NVMe SSD, which it calls the first M.2 SSD designed with datacenter use in mind. The P3100 comes in capacities of up to 1TB. Intel says these SSDs' power and endurance ratings will save their owners money in the long run. Intel says the P3100 operates at about half the power draw of standard enterprise hard drives, while enduring up to 580TB of writes in its largest incarnation. Here's what the full specs look like. Capacity Sequential reads (MB/s) Sequential writes (MB/s) Random 4K reads (IOPS) Random 4K write (IOPS) Endurance rating (TBW) 128GB 720 55 27,000 2,200 72 256GB 1400 100 52,500 5,500 145 512GB 1200 145 88,000 10,000 300 1TB 1800 175 114,000 9,000 580 The biggest hurdle the product has to overcome is that M.2 is more or less a new thing in datacenters. As Storage Reviews notes, there are a few server boards out there with M.2 slots, but not many. If the cost savings the drive offers live up to Intel's promise, datacenter demand for M.2 may increase, meaning we might see more drives like these in the future.

 Michael Phelps takes a not-too-subtle shot at Olympic rival in new commercial for Intel Cork Gaines Oct. 26, 2016, 2:27 PM 19,448 facebook linkedin twitter email print YouTube/Intel Maybe the most memorable moment of the 2016 Rio Olympics occurred prior to the 200-meter butterfly when Michael Phelps was shown with a menacing and somewhat disgusted look on his face while his chief rival, Chad Le Clos of South Africa, was shadow-boxing-dancing-something in the foreground. Many assumed Phelps was annoyed by Le Clos and whatever he was doing. But no matter the reason, in those few seconds, a meme was born: #PhelpsFace. Intel recreated that moment in a new commercial starring Phelps and Jim Parsons. While the commercial has Phelps mimic the PhelpsFace as the result of a slow computer, with a fake Le Clos dancing in the foreground, the best part comes at the end. That's when Parsons asks Phelps what Fake Le Clos is doing. We still don't know either, Michael. Here is the original PhelpsFace moment: Phelps' stare down of Chad le Clos is much better with the Curb Your Enthusiasm theme song: https://t.co/Bpy94Wbb3c https://t.co/q12NPhnP4r — NBC Olympics (@NBCOlympics) August 9, 2016   SEE ALSO: Steve Bartman spokesman calls chances of a World Series appearance 'slim, none, and no chance,' and that is probably for the best DON'T MISS: The 25 schools that make the most money in college sports NOW WATCH: How much the world has changed since the Cubs last won the World Series 108 years ago Loading video...

Subject terms: Parkinson's disease• Neurodegeneration• Technology• Medical research Juan Moyano/Alamy Stock Photo When Steven DeMello started his job as a health-technology researcher, he had no idea that he would soon become a participant in his own research. As part of a University of California initiative, he spent his days studying the potential uses of communication technologies, such as smartphones, in health care. But just a few months into the job, he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. One month later, he was told he also had cancer. He was surprised by the difference in care between the two diseases. To monitor his particular cancer, a rare form of lymphoma, he has a regular blood test, which was weekly at first. Five objectively measured markers tell DeMello and his oncologist what is going on. “When we sit down and look at results over time, we have consistent testing,” says DeMello. “We know the values matter, and we know why they matter.” With his Parkinson's, however, there is no unbiased, quantitative way to assess disease progression. Every four months or so he visits his neurologist, who runs him through an assessment to determine where he falls on the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) — a universal test created, used and validated by neurologists worldwide. He reports any changes in mood, cognition or physical abilities, and he is assessed for tremor, rigidity and irregularities in his gait. The UPDRS test is invaluable, and has been improved over the years, but it is labour intensive. It must be administered by a neurologist, and its results are subjective and depend on how patients such as DeMello are doing at that particular moment — something that, for someone with Parkinson's, can vary hugely from hour to hour, let alone day to day. Part of Nature Outlook: Parkinson's disease There is nothing inherently wrong with the contrast in care, which reflects the different characteristics of these diseases. Cancer can attack rapidly, requiring aggressive treatment, whereas Parkinson's is a chronic disease that might have daily ups and downs but in general progresses over decades. Yet there is much to gain from frequent and quantified monitoring of Parkinson's disease, and many physicians, patients and their carers are keen to have a reliable way to do so. DeMello knew of a new technology that might help. He downloaded an experimental smartphone application called mPower. “I used what I've learned about mobile applications with myself as a guinea pig,” he says. The iPhone app administers a few simple tests — getting him to tap the screen, hold the phone in an outstretched arm or put it in his pocket and walk across the room — so that he can objectively measure and keep tabs on his symptoms on a daily basis. In the past decade, as smartphones, smartwatches and exercise trackers have become more pervasive, the sensors they carry have got more advanced. These are tantalizing tools for researchers looking to monitor everyday movements. And because Parkinson's is a progressive disorder that affects a person's motor skills, it is a good candidate to test the sensors. Scientists are tapping into this technology to gain a more granular look at the symptoms and progression of this insidious disease. Growing potential One of the researchers who helped to develop the mPower app is Max Little, a mathematician at Aston University in Birmingham, UK. Little broke ground in the remote assessment of Parkinson's back in 2006, when technology company Intel recruited him for a project. Intel had amassed thousands of voice recordings from people with the disease, and — because Little had recently developed an algorithm that could identify voice disorders — it was interested in whether he could use the recordings to distinguish people with Parkinson's from those without. Little's algorithms were so successful at identifying people with the disease that he began to look for other opportunities to use them for remote monitoring. When he began a fellowship in a lab that specialized in human–smartphone interactions (and how those data can objectively quantify behaviour), the pieces clicked into place. He has been working on ways to use smartphones to monitor Parkinson's ever since. “Smartphones are pretty miraculous things that are packed full of sensors.” “Smartphones are pretty miraculous things that are packed full of sensors,” says Little. “We're walking around with devices that measure movement and hence behaviour all the time.” Little is investigating approaches that use these sensors to assess the disease. The microphone records someone's voice; a triaxial accelerometer detects their movement in three dimensions to provide information on gait, posture and hand tremor; a gyroscope measures rotation; and the touch screen can evaluate finger tapping and reaction time. Such information might reveal whether a new therapy is effective, an old therapy remains effective, or whether it might be time to change the dose or medication. “I've been using mPower as a way of trying to understand my own trends and, in particular, my own variability,” says DeMello. The app provides a long-term view, so that when he has a few bad days in a row, he is no longer concerned. “That's something that, a few years ago, I would have been much more worried about,” he says. The data show him that, at this point in his disease, a run of bad days will turn around. “It's giving me a way to understand my own patterns.” Despite its obvious allure, tapping into technology that people already have in their pockets is no simple solution for detecting medically important events. mPower was developed to collect a huge amount of data, which researchers could sift through to work out which pieces are useful — just as Little did with the voice recordings. But it is difficult to mine vast amounts of data when there is no certainty that something significant will show up, says Joe Giuffrida, president of Great Lakes NeuroTechnologies, in Cleveland, Ohio. Giuffrida's company has developed wearable, sensor-packed devices and apps that are dedicated to tracking the symptoms of Parkinson's. Rather than trying to pick out a signal from a sea of unverified data, Giuffrida says that it makes more sense to know what you're looking for before starting the analysis. “To develop algorithms, you need gold-standard data to test their output,” he says. “When you just put sensors on a patient and let them loose in the world, it's hard to have that gold standard.” Great Lakes put its sensors on people with Parkinson's disease and gathered data while neurologists determined the participants' UPDRS scores. Then the company recorded thousands of hours of video of the participants wearing the sensors. This allowed its researchers to identify specific moments in the video and sensor data that correlated with different UPDRS scores, and build algorithms using these known quantities. The Great Lakes approach is time- and cost-intensive, however, and the company will charge for the wearable sensors and for a monthly subscription to the app. mPower is free, but before people can use it they must consent to trial conditions and allow their data to be sent back for analysis. And those data are constantly assessed. Andong Zhan, a computer-science PhD candidate at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, helped to develop an app for the Android platform that was an early prototype for mPower. The Hopkins-PD app is also being assessed in several trials, including one called Smartphone-PD, which has been running since 2014. Zhan says that the trial has finally gathered enough data to start verifying the algorithms. The researchers are collaborating with Ray Dorsey, a neurologist at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York, who is assessing some of the people with Parkinson's across the state by teleconference before the patients test themselves using Hopkins-PD. “He gives them a score, and then we correlate that with our score from the smartphones,” Zhan says. Left, Andong Zhan; Right, Max Little & Andong Zhan Full size image (253 KB) Using a general device, rather than one that is specifically made for monitoring, can create issues with data quality. “Because the tests are done at home using smartphones, some of the data can be very noisy,” says Siddharth Arora, an applied mathematician also at Aston University, who is also working on Hopkins-PD, with a focus on data quality. “In a lab, we can control for confounding factors.” The home environment is much less predictable. For a voice test, for instance, there might be someone coughing in the background, he says. Nevertheless, the Hopkins-PD algorithm is producing some striking preliminary results. The results for a finger-tapping test, which assesses a person's motor function, indicate noticeable improvement for some participants after they have taken their medication (see 'Smart data'). The app also records more nuanced information. “It's so exciting to see that simple software and hardware could pick out subtle differences in motor performance in people with Parkinson's,” he says. For now, Arora, Little and their colleagues are honing the app. And others — including drug and medical-device companies — are actively involved in similar experiments. Testing times Smartphone apps may also allow for a change in how Parkinson's therapies are tested and approved. Little is collaborating with the pharmaceutical division of Roche, based in Basel, Switzerland, which has developed a smartphone app for use in a Parkinson's trial. One problem with drug trials is that the participants, just like other people with Parkinson's, are assessed only a few times a year. With such sparse data collection, as DeMello discovered, it is difficult to quantify someone's symptoms and disease progression, let alone gain any detail about how a drug affects them under real-world conditions. What's more, assessments can be affected by the disposition of everyone involved on that particular day. “They're highly subjective,” says Christian Gossens, who heads the early development informatics team at Roche. Technology is free of such whims. The app, Gossens notes, “takes away all influence of mood or stress” for both the patient and the physician, and eliminates differences between observing physicians. The app is being informally assessed as part of a current trial, and the Roche researchers are already seeing benefits. “If you want to zoom into an individual patient, and zoom into disease progression a certain way, now you can,” Gossens says. When you look at a group of patients, or general properties of a disease, he says, “things look like they're on a continuum. But the more you zoom in, the more they become discrete.” Such granularity allows researchers to find and analyse more specific aspects of both drugs and disease. If the app proves useful, Roche will consider including it in future trials in order to file for US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. For now, the FDA remains curious, Gossens says. It wants to know what is technically possible, how it could be valuable, and how future trials of such an app could be regulated. Bootstrapping existing technologies and using them in ways for which they were not intended can yield game-changing results. There are no biomarkers for Parkinson's that definitively identify the disease in its earliest stages. But Little says that he and his colleagues have preliminary evidence that the same smartphone tools can detect sleep issues, which are emerging as useful early warning signs for Parkinson's (see page S5). And then there are applications in countries with less-developed health-care infrastructure. “More than 2 million Parkinson's patients haven't been diagnosed in China,” Zhan says. “Some don't know they have it, and some can't access good health-care resources for diagnosis or treatment.” Zhan imagines a day when a smartphone app could be used in countries such as China and India as an inexpensive, simple way to monitor people who have the disease — or even to help with diagnosis. Smartphones have huge potential, Little says. “We're really only beginning to scratch the surface of what it's possible to do with this technology.” Author information Author information• Related links Affiliations Lauren Gravitz is a science journalist and editor based in Pennsylvania.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 26, 2016 at 12:05PM Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) develops two parallel desktop processor lines. The first is what the company refers to as its "mainstream" processors: These typically have between two and four processor cores as well as integrated graphics technology. They're derived from chips that go into notebook computers. Image source: Intel.  The second is what the company calls high-end desktop processors (HEDT). These chips have between six and 10 processor cores, no built-in graphics, and are derived from the company's server processor lineup. They're generally much more expensive than even the fastest mainstream processors. Back in May, Intel refreshed its high-end desktop product line with a family of chips known as Broadwell-E, replacing the prior-generation Haswell-E series of chips. Broadwell-E's main claim to fame is that with this generation, Intel released a 10-core variant (the first 10-core consumer desktop processor in the industry) for an eye-popping $1,723. Although the company released the first Broadwell-E processors in May, the reality is that the successors to those Broadwell-E parts -- known as Skylake-X -- aren't expected to arrive until the fourth quarter of 2017. Due to that delay (old leaked road maps showed a much more aggressive schedule for Skylake-X), Intel would do well to refresh the current Broadwell-E parts in early 2017. Higher out-of-the-box speeds could be enough Although Intel can bring out new Broadwell-E processors with increased core counts by simply rebadging a server/workstation part and calling it a day, this doesn't seem a likely course of action on Intel's part. Instead, what the company could do is bump up the frequencies at which the current variants run to boost customer interest in the product lineup. If Intel can increase base and turbo-boost frequencies for these parts by around 200 MHz across the board, then that could keep customers interested. Here's what the potential lineup could look like: Metric  Core i7 6820K Core i7 6870K Core i7 6920K Core i7 6970X Cores/threads 6/12 6/12 8/16 10/20 Base/boost frequency 3.6 GHz/3.8 GHz 3.8 GHz/4.0 GHz 3.4 GHz/3.9 GHz 3.2 GHz/3.7 GHz More cores could work well, too A speed bump in the form of the proposed product line above could help bump demand up some, but if Intel wanted to get even more aggressive, it could -- in addition to the speed boosts -- introduce a higher core count model at the very top of the stack. Introducing such a part would be extremely simple -- trivial, in fact. All the company would need to do is to take the workstation-oriented chip known as the Xeon E5 2687W, unlock the multiplier (to allow users to manually adjust the chip's clock speed beyond the rated specification), and sell it as, say, a Core i7 6990X. The 2687W sells for around $2,145, so Intel could probably get away with charging approximately $2,300 for a potential 6990X (the extra $165 seems like a fair trade for the ability to adjust the chip to run at higher speeds). This pricing would be quite steep for a consumer-grade processor, but considering that Intel reported seeing better-than-expected demand for the $1,723 6950X, a $2,300 6990X is still probably worth making.  Not only would introducing an even higher-end, higher-core count model potentially spur demand (buyers of the 10-core are probably the same people who would be interested in upgrading again to a 12-core chip), but it could also lift Intel's desktop processor average selling prices as well.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

USB Type-C and Thunderbolt 3: One port to connect them all 0 Share: Laptops by Dong Ngo October 26, 2016 5:30 AM PDT @riceandstirfry Up Next Does the internet have a fake-news problem? USB-C and Thunderbolt 3: One port to rule them all CNET editor Dong Ngo explains the joy of connecting devices together using the latest USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 standard. by Dong Ngo 2:58 Close Drag Look around your house and chances are you have at least a few devices that use Universal Serial Bus. On average, some 3 billion USB ports are shipped each year, making it by far the most successful peripheral connection type in the world. In fact, device manufacturers are so confident in the new USB-C standard that Intel announced last year that Thunderbolt 3, once thought to be a USB replacement, will use the same port type as USB-C. This means every Thunderbolt 3 port will also work as a USB-C port and every Thunderbolt 3 cable will work as a USB-C cable. Before you can fully appreciate what a leap forward both USB Type-C and Thunderbolt 3 are, let's familiarize you with Type-A, Type-B, and the various versions of the Thunderbolt standard. Thunderbolt Prior to Thunderbolt 3, Thunderbolt 2 and the original Thunderbolt shared the same cable type and port (which is the same port type as Apple's Mini DisplayPort) and had top data transfer speeds of 20Gbps and 10Gbps, respectively. With these older Thunderbolt standards, the cable was active, meaning the cable itself is a device that requires power to operate (which is why most Thunderbolt 1 or 2 devices would require an external power source in order to function.) This made Thunderbolt a much more expensive solution, as the cable itself is some 10 times more expensive than a USB cable of the same length. Thunderbolt revisions Revision Year released Super set of Top speed Port type Thunderbolt 2011 Mini DisplayPort 10Gbps Mini DisplayPort Thunderbolt 2 2013 Thunderbolt 20Gbps Mini DisplayPort Thunderbolt 3 2015 Thunderbolt 2 (adapter required,) DisplayPort, PCIe 3rd Gen, USB 3.1 40Gbps (short or active cable) 20Gbps (long, passive cable,) USB-C Here's how Thunderbolt 3 is different from its predecessors: The Mini DisplayPort connection type has been ditched in favor of a USB-C connection type. All Thunderbolt 3 cables will work as USB-C cables. All USB-C cables will work as Thunderbolt 3 cables as long as they are good quality cables. Thunderbolt 3 has a top data transfer speed of 40Gbps as long as the cable is 0.5m (1.6 ft.) or shorter. For 1m (3.2 ft.) or longer cables, Thunderbolt 3 supports passive (cheaper) ones that have a top speed of 20Gbps, and active cables (more expensive) that retain the 40Gbps speed. Thunderbolt 3 is backward-compatible with earlier versions of Thunderbolt, but due to the new port type, adapters are required to use legacy Thunderbolt devices. Any USB-C device (like a Google Pixel) plugged into a Thunderbolt 3 port will function normally. Since Thunderbolt 3 devices use discrete Thunderbolt chips to function, they will not function if plugged into a USB-C port. All versions of Thunderbolt allow for daisy-chaining up to six devices together to a host and in addition to data, can also carry Hi-Def video and audio signals. USB In the USB world, things are a bit more complicated because there have been more versions and types than Thunderbolt. Generally, the versions refer to the speed and functionality of the USB cable, while the USB type refers to the physical shape and the wiring of the ports and plugs. Let's start with the USB type. For the most part, Type-A ends (left of the coin) of the USB cables remains the same across existing USB versions.Photo by Dong Ngo/CNET USB Type-A Also known as USB Standard-A, USB Type-A is the original design for the USB standard and uses a flat rectangular shape. On a typical USB cable, the Type A connector, aka the A-male connector, is the end that goes into a host, such as a computer. And on a host, the USB port (or receptacle) where the Type A-male is inserted, is called an A-female port. Type-A ports are mostly in host devices, including desktop computers, laptops, game consoles, media players and so on. There are very few peripheral devices that use a Type-A port. Different USB versions including USB 1.1, USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 (more on differing versions below) currently share the same USB Type-A design. That means a Type-A connector is always compatible with a Type-A port event if the device and host use different USB versions. For example, a USB 3.0 external hard drive also works with a USB 2.0 port, and vice versa. Type-A USB port for USB 3.0 (blue) and USB 2.0 on the back of a computer.Photo by Dong Ngo/CNET Similarly, small devices such as a mouse, keyboard or network adapter that have hard-wired USB cables always use Type-A connectors. That's true also for gadgets without cables, such as a thumb drive. USB 3.0's connectors and ports have have more pins than USB 2.0. This is in order to deliver faster speeds and higher power output. However, these pins are organized in a way that doesn't prevent them from physically working with the older version. Also note that there are smaller Type-A plugs and connectors, including Mini Type-A and Micro Type-A, but there are very few devices that use these designs. Popular USB Type-B: From left Standard-B, Mini-B, Micro-B, Micro-B USB 3.0, and Standard-B USB 3.0.Photo by Dong Ngo/CNET USB Type-B Typically, the Type-B connector is the other end of a standard USB cable that plugs into peripheral device (such as a printer, a phone or an external hard drive). It's also known as Type B-male. On the peripheral device, the USB port is called Type B-female. Since the peripheral devices vary a great deal in shape and size, the Type-B connector and its respective port also come in many different designs. Up to now there have been five popular designs for the USB Type-B's plugs and connectors. And since the Type-A end of a USB cable remains the same, the Type-B end is used to determine the name of the cable itself. (Wikipedia has a great USB connector mating matrix you can consult.) The original standard (Standard-B): This design was first made for USB 1.1 and is also used in USB 2.0. It's mostly for connecting large peripheral devices, such as printers or scanners to a computer. Mini-USB (or Mini-B USB): Significantly smaller, the Mini-USB Type-B ports are found in older portable devices, such as digital cameras, phones and older portable drives. This design is now close to obsolete. Micro-USB (or Micro-B USB): Slightly smaller than Mini-USB, the Micro-USB Type-B port is currently being replaced by USB-C as the charging and data port for latest phones and tablets. Micro-USB 3.0 (or Micro-B USB 3.0): This is the widest design and mostly used for USB 3.0 portable drives. Most of the time, the Type-A end of the cable is blue. Standard-B USB 3.0: This design is very similar to the Standard-B, however, it's designed to handle USB 3.0 speed. Most of the time, both ends of the cable are blue. Note that there's also another, less popular, USB 3.0 Powered-B plug and connector. This design has two additional pins to provide extra power to the peripheral device. Also, there's a relatively rare Micro Type-AB port that allows the device to work as either a host or a peripheral device. A few proprietary USB cables for Samsung and Apple devices.Photo by Dong Ngo/CNET Proprietary USB Not all devices use the standard USB cables mentioned above. Instead, some of them use a proprietary design in the place of the Type-B plug and connector. The most famous examples of these devices are the iPhone and the iPad, where either a 30-pin or Lightning connector takes place of the Type-B end. The Type-A end, however, is still the standard size.

It has a top speed of 12Mbps (though in many cases only performs at 1.2Mbps). It's largely obsolete. USB 2.0: Released in April 2000, it has a max speed of 480Mbps in Hi-Speed mode, or 12Mbps in Full-Speed mode. It currently has the max power out put of 5V, 1.8A and is backward-compatible with USB 1.1. USB 3.0: Released in November 2008, USB 3.0 has a top speed of 5Gbps in SuperSpeed mode. A USB 3.0 port -- and its connector -- are usually colored blue. USB 3.0 is backward-compatible with USB 2.0 and its port can deliver up to 5V, 1.8A of power. This is sometimes refereed to as USB 3.1 Gen 1. USB 3.1 (sometimes refereed to as USB 3.1 Gen 2.): Released on July 26, 2013, USB 3.1 doubles the speed of USB 3.0 to 10Gbps (now called SuperSpeed+ or SuperSpeed USB 10 Gbps), making it as fast as the original Thunderbolt standard. USB 3.1 is backward-compatible with USB 3.0 and USB 2.0. USB 3.1 has three power profiles (according to USB Power Delivery Specification), and allows larger devices to draw power from a host: up to 2A at 5V (for a power consumption of up to 10W), and optionally up to 5A at either 12V (60W) or 20V (100W). The first USB 3.1 products are expected to be available in late 2016, and will mostly use USB Type-C design. A compatible Type-C USB cable from Aukey that has a Type-A end.Photo by Dong Ngo/CNET USB Type-C (or USB-C) Physically, the Type-C port and connector are about the same size as those of the Micro-B USB mentioned above. A Type-C port measures just 8.4 by 2.6mm. This means it's small enough to work for even the smallest peripheral devices. With Type-C, both ends of a USB cable are the same, allowing for reversible plug orientation. You also don't need to worry about plugging it in upside down as it will function both ways. Since 2015, USB-C has been widely adapted and used in many phones and tablets. Many new storage devices also use USB-C ports instead of a USB-B port. Almost all devices that support USB 3.1 use the USB-C port. USB 3.1 has a top speed of 10Gbps and can deliver a power output of up to 20 volts (100 watts) and 5 amps. When you consider most 15-inch laptops require just around 60 watts of power, this means in the future they will be charged the way phones are now, via their little USB port. Apple's new MacBook has just one USB-C port as the sole peripheral and power port. Type-C USB also allows for bi-directional power, so apart from charging the peripheral device, when applicable, a peripheral device could also charge a host device. All this means you can do away with an array of proprietary power adapters and USB cables, and move to a single robust and tiny solution that works for all devices. Type-C USB will significantly cut down the a amount of wires currently needed to make devices work. 20 USB Type-C is taking over -- here are the phones to prove it One port, one cable, no fuss Type-C USB and USB 3.1 are backward-compatible with USB 3.0 and USB 2.0. In a pure Type-C USB connection, the Type-A ports and plugs are no longer included. However, you'll find compatible Type A-to-Type C cables. On top of that, there will be adapters to make Type C hosts and devices work with existing USB devices. This is the first time adapters are required with USB connections, and likely the only time, at least for the the foreseeable future. USB Implementers Forum, the group responsible for the development of USB, says that Type-C USB is designed to be future-proof, meaning the design will be used for future and faster USB versions. It will take a few years more for Type-C become to become as popular as the current Type-A on the host side, but when it does it will simplify the way we work with devices. In fact, Intel is even working on a USB audio standard that might render the 3.5mm audio jack obsolete. And with the addition of Thunderbolt 3 now being the super-set of USB-C, eventually, we'll just have only one type of port and cable to connect all peripheral devices to each other and to a computer. It's predicted that, thanks to support for USB-C, the adoption of Thunderbolt 3 will take off, which hasn't been the case with previous versions of Thunderbolt.

The drive has 1 300GB platter and 2 heads at the 300GB capacity, 2 platters and 4 heads at 600GB, and 3 platters and 6 heads at the 900GB level. This gen 6 drive has a two million hours MTBF rating, a 0.44 per cent annualised failure rate, and a five-year limited warranty. There is a self-encrypting version available. Seagate Enterprise Performance v6 SFF drive detail Seagate has no disk drive competition at the 900GB, 15,000rpm product level. WD's HGST Ultrastar C15K600 is a 15,000rpm, 2.5-inch drive that tops out at 600GB. Perhaps we have a C15K900 coming, if WD can see a market for it? Toshiba's AL13SX is also a 600GB, 15,000rpm drive. Like the WD one it uses the same 12Gbit/s SAS interface as Seagate's latest product. And, similarly, we might see a 900GB version of this drive too. El Reg thinks that this 900GB drive from Seagate may possibly be its last such drive made, as SSDs are replacing performance disk drives at quite a rate.

It also extended its refunding program to Basis B1 Band owners. The initial recall didn’t affect older Basis devices. “Today we are letting you know that we will soon stop support for our legacy watch, the Basis B1,” the company wrote in an email to Basis customers. “The B1 has been a central part of our community for 4 wonderful years and we made the difficult decision to stop all services effective December 31, 2016. This means that your watch will no longer function after that date. We know that many of you will be disappointed by our decision and we are deeply sorry for the inconvenience this will cause.” The company first sent a statement in June about overheating issues. Apparently, a small number of people reported that their Peak watches overheated, and in some cases caused discomfort, blistering or burns on their wrist under the watch body. The number of reported cases was very small, approximately 1 in 500 watches sold. It seems that the problems first started back in late 2014, which means the company has not exactly been lightning quick in reacting to the complaints. If you are a Basis Peak or Basis B1 owner, you can return your watch and any accessories for a full refund by applying on this page. Basis recommends you download your old fitness data before the end of this year. Your fitness data will be delivered in a .ZIP document containing a series of .CSV files. A company spokesman said he couldn’t estimate how many Basis Science devices had been sold, and it doesn’t seem to us that a replacement product will be developed any time soon.

But do you really need one? Read our review to find out Rating: 4 out of 5 Written by Karthekayan Iyer | Published:October 26, 2016 4:20 pm Dell Inspiron 11 is the latest from the company that pushes the convertible form factor to an even more affordable price range The PC industry has reported another quarterly decline in shipments, the eighth consecutive quarterly decline. But that hasn’t stopped manufacturers from innovating. The threshold of innovative design is still catapulted by Microsoft (looking at the Surface Book) but the broader PC industry is catching up in the race with thinner design, near bezel-less display and yes, convertible form factor. Dell, Lenovo, HP — all are making convertibles either with detachable keyboards or with a flippable screen. PC OEMs are pushing notebook design towards a convertible form factor, which is a great option. Dell Inspiron 11 Dell Inspiron 11 is the latest from the company that pushes the convertible form factor to an even more affordable price range. The USP of Dell Inspiron 11 is its affordable price, colourful variants and 360-degree hinge. It is that ideal back-to-school notebook that now gains the ability to flip 360-degrees? But do you really need one? Read our review to find out. Specs: 11.6-inch HD (1366 x 768) Display | Windows 10 Home | Intel Pentium N3710 processor | 4GB RAM | 500GB storage | Intel HD Graphics | 2 Cell Li-Ion battery | USB 3.0 x1 | USB 2.0 x2 | HDMI port | microSD card reader | 1.3kg Price: Rs 34,990 What is good? If there is one thing to really like about this notebook, then it is the form factor. I have used notebooks with a 360-degree hinge costing nearly Rs 1,00,000 before, but this is the first time I have found it effective. Since Dell Inspiron 11 features a smaller 11-inch display, it works well in all kind of modes – tent, tablet, stand and standard laptop. If you watch a lot of videos then you’ll find the tablet mode really convincing on this one. With Inspiron 11 series, you get bold colour options – our review unit came in punchy blue colour With Dell Inspiron 11, Windows 10 nicely helps the form factor. The tablet mode with Windows 10 which converts the icons into larger live tiles and disables the keyboard, helps when you flip the notebook flat on its face. Windows 10 core features like Cortana and touch work seamlessly along with easier workflow between programs. The app support is not big, but it is decent enough for PC users. Dell Inspiron 11 is a classic Dell machine, so you get the design the Texas firm is known to deliver. With Inspiron 11 series, you get bold colour options – our review unit came in punchy blue colour. There is also a pink option which is ‘very pink’ in my opinion. The Dell Inspiron 11’s design highlight is the 360-degree hinge which is sturdy and can easily last for years. The design also involves a nicely laid out keyboard and a decently large trackpad. Dell has also laid out the ports nicely allowing for ease of access to HDMI and USB ports. After using Inspiron 11 for more than two weeks, I easily got accustomed to its keyboard and the trackpad After using Inspiron 11 for more than two weeks, I easily got accustomed to its keyboard and the trackpad. The keyboard has a very nice travel and the keys are punchy too. It is certainly not as mushier as the one found on XPS range, but I am convinced that this keyboard will be good enough for writing a thesis or jotting down notes. Right from the early generation Inspiron series, Dell has managed to build a great trackpad and that continues with Inspiron 11 too. I mostly have multiple programmes open on my Windows machine and with Inspiron 11, I was easily able to do three finger swipe up gesture to expose open windows and then switch between them by gently swiping one finger on the trackpad. The feature will be appreciated by people who have multiple apps or programs open on their machine. One of the best things about Dell Inspiron 11 is its sub 1.5Kg weight. Trust me, I carry a notebook that weighs 3Kg and with Inspiron 11, I felt as if my backpack is missing the notebook. Dell Inspiron 11 is light, but it doesn’t compromise on performance, which is another bonus here. What is not good? Dell has also laid out the ports nicely allowing for ease of access to HDMI and USB ports There is only one little quirk with this machine – the display. Dell Inspiron 11 has a 11-inch 1366 x 768 display which is adequate in terms of resolution but fails in terms of brightness and viewing angles. The viewing angle becomes a painpoint when you push the notebook to a slightly odd angle in tent mode. The display is definitely not bad, but it is not the most comfortable one. Should you buy? If you are a student looking for a notebook to take notes or write assignment, Inspiron 11 easily fits the bill With Inspiron 11, Dell has managed to bring the premium convertible design to a sub-35k range and I am convinced it works in the favour of the device. With Dell Inspiron 11, affordability finally meets the convertible design and it will only get cheaper. If you are a student looking for a notebook to take notes or write assignment, Inspiron 11 easily fits the bill. The fact that it weighs just under 1.5Kg, means you can still carry other stuff. If you are a student thinking of a back-to-school notebook, I think this is where your money should be. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Express TechIE Samsung Galaxy S7 Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Gionee S6 Xiaomi Mi 5 Best of Express 26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & Instagram IndiaLIVE: Calls grow for PM Modi to address House over Demonetisation IndiaRahul Gandhi: PM Narendra Modi is running the government of few industrialists IndiaSushma Swaraj suffers kidney failure, undergoes dialysis at AIIMS BusinessSBI writes off Rs 7,016 crore loans owed by wilful defaulters IndiaBirla text message shows payoff to ‘Gujarat CM’ in 2012, says Arvind Kejriwal EntertainmentI am besharam, nudity means nothing to me: Ranveer Singh on Befikre EntertainmentBefikre and all its kisses get U/A certificate, Ranveer Singh calls it family film EntertainmentDirector Ameer questions Rajinikanth's integrity for supporting PM Modi's demonetisation EntertainmentTwinkle asked Karan full form of MNS, his reply will make you forget KWK Must Read SportsDemonetisation greatest move in Indian politics: Kohli SportsThere will be few surprises in the playing XI: Virat Kohli SportsHow the mighty Aussies have fallen TechnologyOnePlus 3T vs OnePlus 3: What's the big difference?

Join For Free Hortonworks DataFlow is an integrated platform that makes data ingestion fast, easy, and secure. Download the white paper now.  Brought to you in partnership with Hortonworks.  The open source Open Network Insights (ONI) project, now called Spot, was recently accepted into the ASF Incubator. Here are the highlights about its open data model approach and initial use cases. One of the biggest challenges organizations face today in combating cyber threats is collecting and normalizing data from numerous security event data sources (often up to thousands of them) to build the required analytics. This process often results in those analytics becoming dependent upon specific technologies for detecting threats and prevents the necessary flexibility and agility for keeping up with these ever-increasing (and complex) attacks. Thus, technology lock-in is often a byproduct of today’s status quo, as it’s extremely costly to add new technologies (or replace existing ones) because of these downstream analytic dependencies. Apache Spot (incubating), formerly known as Open Network Insight (ONI), is an open source project (based on the Cloudera platform) originally developed by Intel Corp. engineers for cyber security analytics, and premised on a community-driven open data model that addresses the need for agility and de-coupling of analytics from threat detection to counter constantly evolving use cases. In this blog post, you’ll get an overview of Spot’s unique open data model and initial use cases. Spot’s Open Data Model Strategy Today, Spot’s primary use case is network traffic analysis for network flows (NetFlow, sFlow, and so on), DNS, and proxy. Essentially, Spot enables identification of threats through anomalous event detection using both supervised and unsupervised machine learning. However, Spot’s open data model strategy aims to extend Spot’s existing capabilities to unlock a broader set of cybersecurity use cases than are currently supported. The availability of an open data model, which can be applied “on-read” or “on-write”, in batch or stream, will allow for the separation of security analytics from the specific data sources on which they are built. This “separation of duties” enables the Spot community to build analytics that are independent of specific technologies and provide the flexibility to change underlying data sources, without impacting the analytics. This approach will also give security vendors the opportunity to build additional products on top of the open data model to drive new revenue streams. For example, to support this broader set of use cases, Spot could be extended to collect and analyze other common event-oriented data sources analyzed for cyber threats, including but not limited to the following log types: Active Directory/identity management User/entity behavior analysis Endpoint/asset management Proxy Web server Operating system Firewall Intrusion prevention/detection Data loss prevention Network meta/session and PCAP files You can learn technical details about Spot’s open data model (and supported data formats) here. Use Cases for Spot, Today Even with this strategy for adding community-driven extensions, today, Spot is unique in its ability to address the following cyber security use cases, which are not effectively addressed by legacy technologies: Detection of Known and Unknown Threats via ML and Advanced Analytic Modeling Current technologies are limited in the analytics they can apply to detect threats. These limitations stem from the inability to collect all the data sources needed to effectively identify threats (structured, unstructured, and so on), and inability to process the massive volumes of data needed to do so. Legacy technologies are typically limited to rules-based and signature detection; they are somewhat effective at detecting known threats but struggle with new threats. Spot addresses these gaps through its ability to collect any data type in any volume. In addition to the various analytic frameworks that are currently supported (including machine learning), Spot unlocks a whole new class of analytics that can scale to today’s demands. The topic model for detecting anomalous network traffic is one example of where the Spot platform excels. Reduction of Mean Time to Incident Detection & Resolution (MTTR) One of the challenges organizations face today is the inability to detect threats early enough to minimize adverse impacts, which stems from the limitations previously discussed with regard to limited analytics. It can also be attributed to the fact that investigative queries often take hours or days to return results. Legacy technologies can’t offer a central data store for facilitating such investigations due to their inability to store and serve the massive amounts of data involved. This limitation cripples incident investigations and results in MTTRs of many weeks and months; meanwhile, the adverse impacts of the breach are magnified, thus making the threat harder to eradicate. Spot addresses these gaps by providing the capability for a central data store that houses all the data needed to facilitate an investigation, returning investigative query results in seconds and minutes (vs. hours and days). Therefore, Spot can effectively reduce incident MTTR and reduce adverse impacts of a breach. Threat Hunting It has become necessary for organizations to “hunt” for active threats as traditional, passive threat-detection approaches are not sufficient. “Hunting” involves performing ad-hoc searches and queries over vast amounts of data representing many weeks or months of events, as well as applying ad-hoc algorithms to detect the proverbial needle in the haystack. Traditional systems do not perform well for these types of activities as the query results sometimes take hours and days to be retrieved. These traditional systems also lack the analytic flexibility to construct the necessary algorithms and logic. In contrast, Spot addresses these gaps in the same ways it addresses others: by providing a central data store with the required analytic frameworks that scale to the required workloads. Join the Mission The Spot project already includes contributors from Cloudera, Intel, eBay, Webroot, Jask, Cybraics, Cloudwick, and Endgame, but for success in its mission, more contributors will be needed. With its open data model approach, Spot has the potential to become a touchpoint project that galvanizes the developer community to help combat the serious (and constantly mutating) cybersecurity threat faced by virtually every organization, and connected consumer, on the planet. We’re confident that ASF governance would go a long way toward making that vision a reality. For more background about the motivation behind Spot, read this.

ARB_gpu_shader_int64 Patches For Intel's Mesa Driver Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 26 October 2016 at 12:05 AM EDT. 12 Comments Well known Intel open-source developer Ian Romanick has published a massive set of 59 patches for enabling GL_ARB_gpu_shader_int64 within core Mesa and their i965 DRI driver. "Whew! Here it is! There are four main groups to this patch series," began Ian Romanick in announcing the patches for this big code addition to Mesa. ARB_gpu_shader_int64 is about adding 64-bit integer support for OpenGL shaders, similar to ARB_gpu_shader_fp64 in bringing double-precision floating data point to shaders. More details on the ARB_gpu_shader_int64 support can be found via this patch series. The INT64 Intel support is limited to Broadwell "Gen 8" hardware and newer. 12 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

TRENDING NOW: Watch Dogs 2 first impressions Home News Deals Brand new Intel Kaby Lake HP laptops, up to $510 Off 7th gen Intel Kaby Lake processors now arrived on HP's lineup - there's even discounts available at up to $510 off By: TweakTown Dealzon | Deals News | Posted: Oct 26, 2016 3:41 am Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Intel's Kaby Lake, the CPU successor to Skylake, is finally hitting the mainline retail shelves as evidenced by HP. Earlier this past weekend, HP added five new 7th Gen laptops to their online store catalog. Four of the five laptops are 15.6-inch machines while the last pick is a 17.3-inch desktop replace - all on the higher-end spectrum in terms of specification. To move units, there are even coupon discounts on the Kaby Lake HP Envy 15 laptops upon release week - something HP has traditionally been doing for the past handful of years.     Keep in mind, Kaby Lake is all about resolution performance. It will have a slightly faster clock speed to 6th gen, but the best reason to go 7th gen is 4K displays and 3D graphics. For the most part, HP is offering 4K, but going 1080p will make it hundreds less.   For all deals use promo code: EMRY9599   Envy 15   15.6" HP Envy 15t i7-7500U, 6GB, 1080p - $639.99 (list $830) 15.6" HP Envy 15t i7-7500U, 8GB, 256GB SSD, 1080p Touch - $719.99 (list $950) 15.6" HP Envy 15 i7-7500U, 16GB, 512GB SSD, 4K - $1,009.99 (list $1,200)   Envy 17   17.3" HP Envy 17 i7-7500U, 16GB, 512GB SSD, GeForce 940MX, 1080p Touch - $989.99 (list $1,500) 17.3" HP Envy 17 i7-7500U, 12GB, GeForce 940MX - $869.99 (list $1,030)   The greatest savings you'll achieve in these opening deals for the HP Envy Kaby Lake laptops is the 17.3-inch model. Its base configuration starts out pretty high-end with a 1080p touch display, discrete graphics, a fast-booting 512GB SSD, and 16GB RAM. Upgrading to a 4K display is available given the Kaby Lake excels in 4K performance, but the display upgrade is fairly costly, being an extra $250.   If you look at all configurations listed above, you'll notice three laptops are customizable and two are pre-built models. The pre-built, like the high-end 15.6-inch 4K model with a 512GB SSD, will be shipped out the next business day from HP and will arrive for free in about a week. The customizable laptops take a little more time because HP will need to build them to your specifications, and will arrive in about two weeks after purchase straight from the factory. GPU options for select machine includes the GeForce 940MX, a mid-range option which will be able to run most modern titles at low to medium settings.

The new MacBook Pro line includes new keyboards, replacing the former row of function keys with Touch ID and dynamic Touch Bar display. Credit: Apple Most Popular Apple unveiled new Mac computers as it seeks to revitalize a product line that co-founder Steve Jobs once said would be rendered redundant by the iPad. Overhauled MacBook Pro laptops and a new computer monitor were presented in a press conference at Apple's Cupertino, Calif., headquarters. While laptops are traditionally more profitable for Apple than the iPad, customers often spend more on films, music and apps with the iPad, making it a long-term moneymaker. The new MacBook Pro has a Touch ID fingerprint scanner which makes it easier to buy online using the Apple Pay payments system. Mr. Jobs heralded tablets as laptop replacements by calling the iPad a "post-PC" device after it launched in 2010. But products like the MacBook Pro have shown surprising resilience. While Mac revenue has fallen from its 2015 peak, the decline in iPad sales has been more precipitous and the laptop now outsells the tablet. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has meanwhile sought to expand services revenue from the App Store, iTunes and iCloud to offset slowing hardware sales. Related Stories Apple Revenue, iPhone Sales Continue to Fall Apple Delays AirPods Rollout, Saying 'We Need a Little More Time' While You're Waiting for Apple's Delayed AirPods, Watch This Hilarious Parody Ad The Power of Cohesive Branding: Why Apple Wins See the Spot: Intel Enlists Michael Phelps to Sink Slow Computers The new version of the MacBook Pro comes with either a 13-inch or 15-inch display. The new laptops are lighter, thinner and narrower than their predecessors, and include larger trackpads and faster chips. The highlight was a new digital function display at the top of the keyboard called the Touch Bar, replacing physical buttons. The thin organic light-emitting diode screen allows functions to change based on the application currently in use. Prices start at $1,499 for a 13-inch version without the new Touch Bar. The 15-inch one starts at $2,399, Apple said. "While we don't expect the updates to meaningfully move the needle, we believe this should return the Mac segment to growth in the near term," Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster said in a note to clients, reiterating his overweight rating. Apple also announced a 5K monitor developed with LG Electronics that connects to the new MacBook Pro, and a new TV app. Apple last released new laptop computers in the middle of 2015, and has gradually lost customers in the intervening period. The iPhone maker's personal computing market share fell to 7.4% in the three months through September, down from 8.1% a year earlier, researcher IDC said this month. "Apple is going to be able to regain some of the market share that they've lost in the higher end notebook market because so many of their products have got so long in the tooth," Shannon Cross, an analyst at Cross Research, said before the event. Apple shares slipped about 1% to $114.48 at the close in New York. The stock had jumped about 20% in the past three months on hope for strong sales of the new iPhone 7. After a cautious holiday forecast earlier this week from the company, the shares have given up some of those gains. If Apple is able to sell more services through Macs, they can become far more profitable than iPads, Needham & Co. analyst Laura Martin said before the product launch. "Then you really do want to sell more Macs, because it's not only a higher upfront fee but then if you can get the same services revenue that's a more powerful growth engine." The Mac's average selling price is almost $800 more than the iPad, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and Apple got 11% of its $216 billion annual revenue from the computer, with the iPhone accounting for most of the rest. Siri, introduced to the Mac operating system in September, could also help guarantee a cut of revenue from taxis, meals and other services ordered with the virtual assistant via computers. Siri can be activated more easily using the new Touch Bar. -- Bloomberg News In this article: Consumer Electronics Design Digital Shopper Marketing Technology Become a Member Register Now Renew Membership Benefits Datacenter Advertising Age     Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Instagram YouTube Tumblr Copyright © 1994-2016 Crain Communications Privacy Statement Terms of Use About Us Advertise Reprints Contact Us AD AGE Creativity LookBook Datacenter Resources Events Jobs On Campus Site by AREA 17 x Scroll to Continue

Touching the future: MacBook Pro slims down, speeds up and gets Touch Bar OLED strip adobe apple computer mac macbook pro macos new macbook pro news notebook os x photo processing photography workstation photoshop touch bar by Jeremy Gray posted Thursday, October 27, 2016 at 3:29 PM EST     The MacBook Pro has long been a valuable tool for MacOS photographers. However, it has been a considerable length of time without any major refreshes, instead receiving annual speed bumps and minor tweaks. At today's "Hello Again" Mac event hosted at Apple's Cupertino headquarters, the tech giant has finally offered up what is perhaps its biggest MacBook Pro refresh ever. New Features: Redesigned inside and out Available in 13- and 15-inch sizes, the new MacBook Pro utilizes Intel's sixth-generation family of processors, including dual-core i5 and i7 processors in the 13-inch MacBook Pro models and quad-core i7 processors in the 15-inch models. The smaller MacBook Pros offer 76% better 3D graphics and video editing than the previous generation whereas the larger models offer 130% better 3D graphics and 57% faster video editing. In addition to faster specs, the MacBook Pros use 2133MHz memory that starts at 8GB in the 13" models (expandable to 16GB) and 16GB on the 15" models. Further, built-in SSD storage now starts at 256GB for all models and comes with an available upgrade up to 2TB. The SSD storage itself has data speeds up to 3.1GB/s, which is up to 50% faster than the previous generation Apple notebooks. While the internals are a nice bump, the biggest change is the body itself. Thinner than ever, the new MacBook Pro notebook is a mere 14.9 millimeters with a 13-inch display and 15.5 millimeters thin in the 15-inch model, representing a respective decrease in thickness of 17% and 14%. Volume has decreased as well by 23% and 20% respectively. Audio volume, on the other hand, is increased due to an all-new speaker design which includes twice the audio dynamic range of previous models. The Force Touch-equipped trackpad is much larger as well, up to two times larger compared to the previous-gen MacBook Pro models. You have probably noticed the distinct lack of a function row on the new butterfly-mechanism keyboard (this new keyboard is Apple's thinnest and uses the same technology found in the recent MacBook revision). Instead, the Touch Bar, an OLED touch strip, sits at the top of the keyboard. This allows users to have context-dependent keys at their fingertips. It's easy to imagine the possibilities for different applications, having perhaps your most-used functions available on your keyboard. The display maintains the same 2560 x 1600 and 2880 x 1800 resolutions for the 13 and 15-inch models respectively, but the displays are said to be of higher quality and be more energy efficient. Specifically, when compared to the previous-gen MacBook Pro, the new display in the 15-inch model is 67% brighter, has a 67% higher contrast ratio and displays 25% more colors. It displays 125% of the sRGB color gamut. Efficiency in general is a focus with these new machines as they offer "all-day battery life" of up to 10 hours for both the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pros.      Rather than release an updated MacBook Air, Apple has instead opted to release the new 13-inch MacBook Pro in a configuration that does not include the new OLED Touch Bar. This more traditional keyboard-equipped laptop comes standard with a slower i5 processor than its Touch Bar-equipped sibling, slower graphics and two fewer Thunderbolt 3 ports, but also with a lower price tag. Pricing and Availability What do these new machines cost? The Touch Bar-less 13-inch MacBook Pro starts at just under US$1,500. A Touch Bar, more speed and more ports takes the total up to around $1,800. If you want a fully-maxed out 13-inch MacBook Pro, including a 3.3GHz dual-core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of SSD storage (only the 15-inch model can be expanded up to 2TB of storage), your total comes to $2,900. Looking at the 15-inch model, which starts at $2,400 for a 2.6GHz i7, 16GB of RAM, 256GB of SSD storage and a Radeon Pro 450 graphics processor (2GB of VRAM), the price can climb very quick with built-to-order options. The machine's price tag reaches $4,300 with a 2.9GHz quad-core Intel i7 processor, 2TB of PCIe-based SSD storage, and Radeon Pro 460 (4GB VRAM) graphics. Despite rumors to the contrary, there is no 32GB RAM option available on any of the new MacBook Pro models.     The Touch Bar-less MacBook 13-inch model is available today whereas the 13-inch and 15-inch Touch Bar MacBook Pro notebooks are shipping in 2-3 weeks but are available for preorder now. All three models are available in "space gray" and "silver" color options. What does the new MacBook Pro and Touch Bar mean for photographers? First things first, if you enjoyed using the SD card slot of the previous-generation MacBook Pro machines, you'll notice that it's gone. In its place are four Thunderbolt 3 ports, however, which should prove to be very versatile. After you get adapters, of course. Not necessarily convenient, but certainly powerful. The new Touch Bar is probably the most exciting aspect of the new MacBook Pro generation for photographers. Imagine wanting to straighten out an image and being able to slide your finger on the Touch Bar to adjust the angle of your image. Or to change your tool in Photoshop. Perhaps you'll soon be able to scroll through your photo library by sliding your finger across the Touch Bar while using Lightroom. The possibilities with the Touch Bar are extensive and it will be very exciting to see how different applications utilize it following the launch of the new notebooks.     In fact, Adobe came on stage at Apple's event to discuss Photoshop specifically. As Adobe's representative, Bradee Evans, said, the new MacBook Pro and Photoshop are "made for each other." She was working on an image and accessed "select and mask" right from the Touch Bar. After choosing "select and mask," the Touch Bar changed to showcase only tools required for the selection process. You can resize brushes and perform simple tasks without having to slow down. What about adding a new layer? Easy with the Touch Bar. While using the Touch Bar, you can also better utilize Photoshop's fullscreen display mode, which is usually hampered by your inability to access your tools while using the mode. It will be interesting to see what other features are incorporated when Photoshop is updated for the Touch Bar before the end of this year.

Apple improved the display with more colors, contrast and brightness. The MacBook Pro packs Core i7 and Radeon Pro graphics. The MacBook Pro is able to drive two 5K displays. Apple worked with LG to develop special 5K monitors for the MacBook Pro. The new MacBook Pro goes on sale today. The Macbook Pro with Touch Bar ship in 2 to 3 weeks. The new thinnest and lightest MacBook Pro ever features a breakthrough interface that replaces the traditional row of function keys with a brilliant, Retina-quality Multi-Touch display called the Touch Bar. The new MacBook Pro features Apple’s brightest and most colorful Retina display yet, the security and convenience of Touch ID®, a more responsive keyboard, a larger Force Touch trackpad and an audio system with double the dynamic range. It’s also the most powerful MacBook Pro ever, featuring sixth-generation quad-core and dual-core processors, up to 2.3 times the graphics performance over the previous generation, super-fast SSDs and up to four Thunderbolt 3 ports. The Touch Bar places controls right at the user’s fingertips and adapts when using the system or apps like Mail, Finder, Calendar, Numbers, GarageBandm Final Cut Pro X and many more, including third-party apps. For example, the Touch Bar can show Tabs and Favorites in Safari, enable easy access to emoji in Messages, provide a simple way to edit images or scrub through videos in Photos and so much more. “This week marks the 25th anniversary of Apple’s first notebook; through the years each generation has introduced new innovations and capabilities, and it’s fitting that this all-new generation of MacBook Pro is the biggest leap forward yet,” said Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. “With the groundbreaking new Touch Bar, the convenience of Touch ID, the best Mac display ever, powerful performance, improved audio, blazing fast storage and Thunderbolt 3 connectivity in our thinnest and lightest pro notebook yet, the new MacBook Pro is the most advanced notebook ever made.” Building on innovations pioneered in MacBook®, the new MacBook Pro features an entirely new enclosure design and all-metal unibody construction that creates an incredibly rigid and dense notebook that is amazingly thin and light. At just 14.9 mm thin, the 13-inch MacBook Pro is 17 percent thinner and 23 percent less volume than the previous generation, and nearly half a pound lighter at just three pounds. The new 15-inch MacBook Pro, at just 15.5 mm thin, is 14 percent thinner and 20 percent less volume than before, and weighing just four pounds, is nearly half a pound lighter. Integrated into the power button is the convenience and security of Touch ID, one of the great features customers have come to know and love from their iPhone® and iPad. Once you enroll your fingerprint in Touch ID on your MacBook Pro, you can quickly unlock your Mac®, switch user accounts and make secure purchases with Apple Pay® on the web with a single touch. Touch ID enables a quick, accurate reading of your fingerprint and uses sophisticated algorithms to recognize and match it with the Secure Enclave in the new Apple T1 chip. The best Mac display ever delivers images that are more vivid, reveal even greater detail and appear more lifelike than ever. As thin as a MacBook display at .88 mm, the Retina display on the new MacBook Pro at 500 nits of brightness, is an amazing 67 percent brighter than the previous generation, features 67 percent more contrast and is the first Mac notebook display to support a wider color gamut. And with power-saving technologies like a larger pixel aperture, a variable refresh rate and more power-efficient LEDs, the display consumes 30 percent less energy than before. Powerful processors, cutting-edge graphics, blazing-fast SSDs, high-speed memory and an advanced thermal architecture deliver amazing pro-level performance in a dramatically thinner enclosure. Sixth-generation dual-core Core i5 with eDRAM, dual-core Core i7 with eDRAM and quad-core Core i7 Intel processors deliver pro-level processing performance while conserving energy. The new 15-inch MacBook Pro features powerful Radeon Pro discrete graphics delivering up to 2.3 times more performance than the previous generation; while the 13-inch MacBook Pro comes with Intel Iris Graphics that are up to two times faster than before. All models feature SSDs with sequential read speeds over 3GBps and Thunderbolt 3 which consolidates data transfer, charging and twice the video bandwidth in a single port — allowing users to drive a 5K display and power their MacBook Pro with a single cable. The New MacBook Pro Also Offers: • Much larger Force Touch trackpads — 46 percent larger on the 13-inch MacBook Pro and twice as large on the 15-inch MacBook Pro; • More responsive and comfortable typing on the keyboard with a second-generation butterfly mechanism; • Louder, more true-to-life sound through speakers with double the dynamic range and improved bass; • macOS Sierra, the world’s most advanced desktop operating system, with new features like Siri® integration, Universal Clipboard, Apple Pay on the web and Photos, which helps you rediscover your meaningful memories, organize your library and perfect shots like a pro.

Skip to main content Toggle navigation Dowser Windows Errors Fixes and Guides DLLs Event ID 37: Тhe Speed of Processor in Group 0 is Being Limited (Fix) October 27, 2016October 27, 2016 Jenna K. Fixes and Guides Have you seen this message: “Speed of Processor X In Group 0 is Being Limited by System Firmware”. Learn how to fix it with our guide! The Event ID 37 error, accompanied with the “Speed of Processor In Group is Being Limited by System Firmware” warning message is a relatively common problem users tend to experience, mainly due to Intel SpeedStep Technology. Some of our readers have recently encountered this message and were wondering what it means and how to deal with it, which is why we’ve created this article. On its own, SpeedStep technology is actually a pretty useful and even necessary tool, which is built in a lot of Intel processors. It regulates your processor’s clock speed depending on the demand for it at a given point in time. For example, when there is a certain process or software running, SpeedStep technology increases the clock speed of your machine, so that the task or program runs quickly and smoothly. The same built-in Intel feature is responsible for decreasing the speed of your processor, when it’s idle and not in use. This, in turn, will significantly lessen the electricity consumption of your computer and will prevent it from heating up. The Event ID 37: “Speed of Processor In Group is Being Limited by System Firmware”  warning message, caused by this feature, is visible in the Windows Event Log and typically informs you of the processor being in “reduced performance for seventy one seconds since the last report”. Below are a few steps to help you fix that. Event ID 37: “Speed of Processor In Group 0 is Being Limited” The Guide To begin with, you will need to reset your BIOS settings to Default. Be sure to have the latest drivers for your hardware and especially for these three: Chipset (Motherboard), Intel® Rapid Storage Technology, Video Card. Clean your computer from any dust – you will have to open it and clean it by hand. Check online if you are unsure how to open your PC make for this purpose. This is important to make sure your machine isn’t overheating. Next, you will have to disable SpeedStep Technology, which you can either do in your BIOS or in Windows Environment. We will show you how to do both. Disabling SpeedStep Technology from BIOS: Enter your computer’s BIOS (check online if you’re not sure how to do this, as this is different from PC to PC brand and model) and reset them to Default. Navigate to a setting that will be called one of the following: Dynamic CPU Frequency, Intel SpeedStep, SpeedStep or EIST (Enhanced Intel SpeedStep). Select either Disable or Always High, depending on the options given. If you see none of these, move on to the next method. Disabling SpeedStep Technology from Windows: Press the Windows + R key combination and in the resulting dialog box type “control panel”. Press Enter. Locate Power Options (switch View to Small Icons if necessary) and open it. Under Preferred plans, click on Change plan settings opposite the plan that is ticked. Choose Change advanced power settings. In the new window, select High Performance from the dropdown menu. Click on Processor power management to expand it and set both the Minimum and Maximum Processor State to 100%. After this, click Apply and OK. Restart your PC.

Kola raised her first $210 million fund in 2006 with Vinod Dham, best known for developing Intel’s Pentium chip, and placed bets on e-commerce start-ups just as that business began to take off. Published: 23:05 October 27, 2016 Bloomberg   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE BENGALURU: If the start-up market in India is headed for a crash, no one will pay as high a price as Vani Kola. The 52-year-old is co-founder of Bangalore-based Kalaari Capital and one of the country’s largest venture investors. She’s raised about $650 million and holds stakes in more than 60 start-ups, including the country’s two most valuable, Flipkart Online Services Pvt. and Jasper Infotech Pvt’s Snapdeal. But this year is shaping up to be perhaps the roughest ever for India’s technology companies. Foreign giants like Amazon.com Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc. have trained their sights on the market just as many venture firms slash investments, fuelling predictions that most local players will be squashed. Kola isn’t backing off. She has kept up her pace of investments and even launched an accelerator a year ago to nurture more entrepreneurs. “There’s a recent view that the story of most Indian start-ups is over and Uber and Amazon can declare victory,” she said during an interview in the board room of Kalaari’s incubator, decorated with traditional Indian brass oil lamps and an impressionistic painting of a sheep and train engine. “I will never underestimate these entrepreneurs’ ability to think their way out of a problem.” Kola has a record of success. She raised her first $210 million fund in 2006 with Vinod Dham, best known for developing Intel’s Pentium chip, and placed bets on e-commerce start-ups just as that business began to take off. Since parting with Dham, she has raised another $440 million, making her the second-largest firm in India by assets and the biggest run by a woman, according to researcher Preqin Ltd. Of the firm’s 84 investments, Kola has managed to sell 21 start-ups. “She is among the top five VCs in India,” said Mohandas Pai, chairman of the venture firm Aarin Capital Advisors and former chief financial officer at outsourced Infosys Ltd. “She came to the internet business very early. Nobody else saw its potential then.” ‘Not That Kind of People’ Kola grew up in the southern city of Hyderabad and studied engineering at university. She headed to the U.S for a master’s degree when she was 20 and stumbled upon her first business idea a few years later while working as a product engineer. When she called home in 1996 to tell her father, a government employee, that she was starting a company, he was hardly enthusiastic. “We are not that kind of people,” he said. She went ahead and founded RightWorks Corp., which helped businesses set up software systems to buy and sell globally. After some early struggles, she signed on customers like General Electric Co. and PepsiCo Inc., and four years later agreed to sell control of the business for $657 million in cash and stock. She had become an entrepreneur — and a rich one. She started another company, Certus Software, and sold her stake in that one too. By the end of 2005, she had money and experience: She decided to move back to India and work with young entrepreneurs. She raised her first $210 million in capital in about six months, persuading investors the time was ripe for India’s entrepreneurs. Many of her fellow countrymen who had gained experience abroad were returning home, and the opportunities in sectors like e-commerce looked enormous. “Many people talked of the limitations; I saw the possibilities,” she said. She was convinced that local start-ups would have a fundamental edge over foreign competitors. She reasoned that outsiders would struggle to navigate complex business practices that are unlike any place in the West, including inefficient payment practices, Byzantine regulations and underdeveloped infrastructure. “Even today, the delivery boy will call the customer 20 times to announce he is coming, ask for directions, etc,” Kola says. Shortly after setting up her fund, she began to get unsolicited e-mails and phone calls from a pair of twentysomethings, Kunal Bahl and Rohit Bansal. The duo had started an e-commerce company that had been turned down by every other venture investor they could find. Kola met them at the boardroom of Kalaari, in the Whitefield neighbourhood of Bengaluru. Within 48 hours, she offered her support. She was drawn to the pair’s discipline and ambitious plans to give Indian consumers efficient online commerce, through what is now called Snapdeal. “Vani was our first institutional investor and we had done the rounds of all the 13 other VCs by then,” Bahl recalled. “What could she have possibly seen in us? We were two struggling 26-year-olds selling physical coupon books!” The relationship hurtled through difficult stretches. In 2013, Snapdeal was close to running out of cash. Kola came in and agreed to invest 20 per cent of her fund into the start-up. “When someone does that, you want to give your 1,000 per cent,” Bahl said. The effort has paid off: Snapdeal was last valued at $7 billion, according to CB Insights. Kola has also invested in the travel website Via and the fashion retailer Myntra. The latter grew to become India’s biggest fashion website and was acquired by Flipkart, the leader in e-commerce, for $330 million. Kola’s strategy to invest in ambitious entrepreneurs who want to create something big in a new and emerging market was becoming rewarding. She says her decisions stem in part from a willingness to accept the risk of not being right all the time. “Vani is insightful and supportive yet very frank and firm on non-performance,” said Ratan Tata, who is interim chairman of the Tata Group conglomerate and sits on Kalaari’s advisory board. ‘Best Friend Hasn’t Called’ The firm’s incubator, in a glass and chrome building next door to Kalaari’s offices, has the bustle of a Silicon Valley start-up — with Indian touches. Kola is dressed in a hand-embroidered white and blue salwar kameez, formal Indian attire consisting of a tunic and loose pants. She wears a nose ring. One of her frequent gestures is to close her eyes while talking as if to concentrate on a particular point. She says she draws lessons for work from raising two girls through their teenage years. “It’s not about being popular all the time,” Kola said. “It’s about setting them on the right path through thoughtful dialogue, treating their personal vulnerabilities with discretion and being there to support them during their moments of self-doubt.” She makes a point of getting back to founders within 24 hours no matter where she is. Kola has given advice on personnel crises, financial strains, stressful conversations and management strategy. Snapdeal co-founder Bahl refers to her, only part jokingly, as his “work mother.” At the incubator, start-up founders get parent-like perks too. There are fruits and other healthy snacks every morning and home-made chikki, a kind of peanut brittle. There are also personal trainers, exercise equipment and weekly meditation lessons. “It is not just caring about what they do but caring about them in a wholesome way,” Kola says, closing her eyes. She recharges at her farmhouse an hour’s drive from downtown Bengaluru. A lifelong vegetarian, she grows her own produce there to supply most of the family’s food and keeps a pair of Labradors. She meditates every day and follows the ancient Indian philosophy of karma, whereby good deeds contribute to future happiness. She also responds to her daughters at least as quickly as her entrepreneurs. She’s stepped out of meetings to answer their distress calls, including when she left a board meeting to talk her younger teenage daughter through a meltdown. “My best friend hasn’t called and it’s my birthday,” the girl said. These days are considerably more tense for entrepreneurs in India. Venture money is drying up, especially with the retreat of foreign firms like Tiger Global Management. One research firm has started a list of dead or dying start-ups, called the Deadpool, that stretches to more than 800 companies. Kola is funding many of the entrepreneurs who would otherwise be shutting down, just like she did with Snapdeal. She put money into 10 companies in the first three quarters of this year through Kalaari, about the same pace as last year, and has funded another eight start-ups through her accelerator. During a second interview at the coffee shop of a luxury hotel, she sounded more than a little protective of her portfolio companies. “Their death has been foretold many times but I can say this much, these companies are not slated to die,” she said, dipping a biscuit into her cup of ginger-infused green tea. Kola has a majority of her investments in e-commerce, one of the gloomier segments now that Amazon is spending billions to win over customers. Bangalore-based Zivame is a online shop for lingerie that lets people buy intimate clothing more discreetly, while Guarented offers home furniture and appliances on short-term rentals to on-the-move millennials. Mumbai-based Holachef offers 400 freshly-made menu items, a pioneer in a once-popular niche that is now far out of favour. “Foodtech start-ups have gone from everybody-loves-you to nobody-thinks-you-can-succeed,” said Kola. The start-up has streamlined its supply chain and focused on making each transaction profitable as it works to survive the downturn. She believes more than ever that local entrepreneurs will hold their ground against foreign competition. To illustrate, she explains the experience of shopping for a car when she returned to India from the US. There are no lots for customers to check out models, so employees brought cars to her doorstep for test drives. When she finally chose the car she wanted, the salesman arrived at her home with the car, all the necessary paperwork, as well as a basket of flowers, coconut and chocolates “” for the divine offering that is customary before driving a new car in India. “India can never be a repeat of the US or China,” she said. tags from this storyIndia follow this tag on MGNUnited States follow this tag on MGNChina follow this tag on MGN filed underGulfNewsBusinessSME tagsIndia follow this tag on MGN+ MGNUnited States follow this tag on MGN+ MGNChina follow this tag on MGN+ MGN Close Recommended For You John, Sonakshi deliver a punch with ‘Force 2’PUBLISHED ON Nov 16, 2016 'Don't panic over scrapped rupees' PUBLISHED ON Nov 16, 2016 5 National Day travel destinations under Dh3,300PUBLISHED ON Nov 16, 2016 Feedback Get The Paper Our Apps Mobile friendly version Our location Advanced Search Sitemap MY GULF NEWS GulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

Pocket-lint Sections Apps Cameras Cars Drones Fitness Trackers Gadgets Games Headphones Laptops Parenting Phones Smart Home Smartwatches Speakers Tablets TV VR News Reviews Features Deals YouTube Instagram Facebook Twitter Google+ search Phones Best Phone Cameras Fitness trackers Parent hub Smart home EE Pocket-lint Awards Apple MacBook Pro (2016) with Touch Bar: Thinner, brighter, faster, and very touchy feely Stuart Miles27 October 2016Laptops Pocket-lint From £1,749 (with Touch Bar) Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Apple has revamped its MacBook Pro range delivering a device that is thinner, lighter and more powerful, and we were at the Apple Event at the company's headquarters to check it out ahead of it going on sale in November. Rather than just roll out the usual annual revamp of new and improved internal specs, the company has added a new feature, called Touch Bar, that it hopes will change the way you use your Mac in the future. Apple MacBook Pro (2016): Exterior design Now available in grey or the traditional MacBook Pro silver, the new MacBook Pro will come in two sizes, 13- and 15-inch, and three different off the shelf models. It will feature a somewhat familiar design, but with a number of enhancements. On the outside that means all the familiar ports have been removed, like the MacBook that launched in 2015. The MacBook Pro ditches the USB sockets, the SD card slot, DisplayPort, the Magsafe power adapter, in fact everything except the headphone socket - clearly not enough Courage just yet. Don't panic though, the MacBook Pro does have connections. Four Thunderbolt 3 sockets that can be used to power and connect to an array of different devices, supporting standards like USB Type-C, DisplayPort, HDMI and more. Those changes mean that the laptop is now considerably smaller and thinner than before, with Apple being able to shave 3mm off the thickness without resorting to the Apple MacBook Air trick of a thin wedge design.  This is Apple simplifying, but it could also lead, in the short term, to dongle city, as you'll need to use adapters to connect most existing equipment you have, or upgrade to different cables. Apple MacBook Pro (2016): Release date, specs and everything you need to know Pocket-lint Apple MacBook Pro (2016): Under the lid Flip the lid and the new MacBook Pro has gone under a radical design change too. The screen is much brighter, crisper, and more colourful, with the 13-inch model offering a 2560 x 1600 pixel resolution and the 15-inch model 2880 x 1800 pixels. The keyboard has been tightened, getting the same feel as the MacBook, while the trackpad has doubled in size. The keyboard is stiff, certainly compared to the current MacBook Pro range, and it's a similar, but improved, tech found in the current 12-inch MacBook keyboard. It's comfortable to type on, but will take a moment to realign your typing skills. The tighter keyboard is now sandwiched between two speakers that promise a louder, clearer, cleaner noise although we were unable to tell the improvement based on the loud gaggle of journalists at the event keen to get their hands on the new laptop. Pocket-lint Apple MacBook Pro (2016): The Touch Bar While these changes might not affect how you do use your MacBook Pro on a daily basis, the biggest change, and one that is likely to get the biggest wow, is the introduction of a new feature called Touch Bar. The Touch Bar is OLED strip that replaces the Fn and system keys, running across the top of the keyboard. It dynamically changes based on what you're doing and what apps you're using. It doesn't offer any form of haptic feedback however, it's for touch only. That means it can go from offering volume keys one minute to displaying an array of smiling emoji the next. It's very cool, very responsive, and very easy to use. We especially like the ability to scroll through pictures in the Photos App or picking the right emoji in a tweet. The visual performance is similar to the Apple Watch; it is beautifully crisp and clean. Switch apps and the options change, while you can customise the default options all via the settings display. Furthermore, the Touch Bar has a Touch ID sensor buried beneath it at the far right-hand side hidden under a small piece of sapphire crystal (presumably to stop it scratching). That means you'll not only be able to unlock your Mac in the same way you do your iPhone, but also use Apple Pay on the web. While the keyboard is identical in size on both the 13 and 15-inch models, the trackpad on the 15-inch model is considerably larger, meaning more space to work on this bigger model. For those on a budget (a £1,449 sort of budget) there is an entry-level MacBook Pro available without the Touch Bar. This model also only has two Thunderbolt 3 ports. Apple Touch Bar: What can I do with it and what apps are supported? Pocket-lint Apple MacBook Pro (2016): At the core It's not just about the exterior, the internals gets a refresh too with new processors, new graphics, and faster storage. The starting model features a 2.0GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost speeds up to 3.1GHz, 8GB of RAM and 256GB SSD storage and will cost £1,449 making it a very pricey upgrade from the £900 12-inch MacBook or £949 MacBook Air. If you want to get that Touch Bar you'll have to dig deep. Featuring a 2.9GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost speeds up to 3.3GHz, 8GB of RAM and 256GB SSD it will cost £1,749.  If you want to go big, there is a 15-inch MacBook Pro that comes with the Touch Bar, a 2.6GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor with Turbo Boost speeds up to 3.5GHz, 16GB RAM and 256GB SSD, but that will cost you £2,349. This also gets you AMD Radeon GPU options too. This is Apple returning back to the traditional MacBook Pro pricing of yesteryear and one that will insist you are serious about getting the company's new flagship laptop. There are a number of options, however, like storage, RAM and GPU on the 15-inch models, but the top configurations are costly. First Impressions With or without the Touch Bar the new 2016 Apple MacBook Pro looks to be an amazing laptop that will get MacBook users excited. It's smaller, lighter, but more powerful, bringing the MacBook Pro line back to be ahead of the MacBook launched last year. Adding the Touch Bar is a more innovative move. It gives Apple MacBook Pro users greater touch control they are probably used to without making the entire screen one big touch screen like the iPad. That was something that Steve Jobs always said was a big "no, no". But by adding touch elements that change an adapt, the laptop becomes a lot more intelligent, and smudge free. It's certainly got the wow factor, we can't wait to get to see how it works in the real world.

Apple debuts MacBook Pro Apple announces its lightest, thinnest notebook ever. The new laptop features an all-metal design, a Touch Bar, and it comes in two sizes, 13-inch and 15-inch. It also comes in two colors, silver and space gray. 2:05 Close Drag If you really want a MacBook Pro, you'll buy a new MacBook Pro. But maybe you're on the fence. How does the new Mac compare to the Windows competition? Truth be told, there aren't as many direct competitors as you'd think. The recently upgraded Microsoft Surface Book, the 14-inch Razer Blade and the Dell XPS 15 are the main machines you'd probably buy instead -- if you're looking for a lot of processing power in a fairly thin frame.

Apple claims new MacBook Pros each have twice the graphical power of the ones it released in 2015. Still, that's only on the 15-inch model: most of these Windows machines will likely trounce the 13-inch MacBook Pro's integrated graphics in games and other graphically intensive tasks. And as you can see from the chart, the weight and size advantages also aren't as big as you'd think. Windows machines have made some major strides in the last few years while Apple was working on its big new update. On paper, battery life is definitely still the best reason to buy a Mac, unless you count the Surface Book -- but the Surface Book will likely have a dual-core processor. It's impressive that Apple is quoting 10 hours for the 15-inch quad-core. If you want a touchscreen or stylus, Windows is the way to go. Apple makes Thunderbolt 3 more versatile with USB-C charger Apple designs new ports for MacBook Pro with four Thunderbolt 3 ports; each one can also act as a charger. 2:20 Close Drag And there's always way more to any computer than you'll see in a spec sheet, even when it comes to specs: we're very curious how Apple's speedy new solid-state storage and improved display stack up, too. Plus, the new USB-C ports might make Apple's computer easier to charge -- both Microsoft and Razer's machines use proprietary chargers instead of the new USB charging standard. We'll need to do some extensive testing to be sure. Check out all of today's Apple news here! Correction, 1:10p.m. PT:The 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is $1,799, not $1,499. Also fixed a couple other copy/paste issues with the non-Touch Bar version, which has 2 Thunderbolt 3 ports, not 4.

(AAPL) Will Kill Why Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Ended the Free Supercharger Ride Apple Inc.’s (AAPL) New MacBook Pro Is Actually a Monster Hit Recent Posts: Apple Inc. (AAPL) Could Launch Apple Glasses by 2018 The Next Thing Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Kill Why Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Ended the Free Supercharger Ride View All Posts Yesterday was Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) turn in the spotlight, but today all eyes were on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). The company just wrapped up an event in Cupertino where it revealed the long-awaited new MacBook Pro, complete with Touch Bar and Touch ID sensor. Here’s what AAPL announced today. Source: Apple The MacBook Pro is a critical anchor in AAPL’s Mac computer lineup. The company has kept its professional users waiting a long time. The MacBook Pro hadn’t seen a revision in over 500 days, and during that time, Microsoft introduced it’s first laptop in the Surface Book — and then took the wraps off a version it claimed offered three times the speed of a 13-inch MacBook Pro. Today, AAPL fired back. The New MacBook Pro After pointing out that this week marks 25 years of Apple laptops, the new MacBook Pro was introduced. Available in 13-inch and 15-inch sizes, the new MacBook Pro is significantly thinner, lighter and more powerful than the previous generation. It has a Force Touch trackpad that has doubled in size and uses the butterfly keyboard pioneered with the new MacBook. 10 Hottest Gadgets for the 2016 Holiday Shopping Season The display is 67% brighter and graphics performance is boosted by over 50% to as much as 130% when working with 3D graphics. The 15-inch MacBook Pros come standard with a sixth generation Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) Core i7 CPU, while the 13-inch version comes with the a Core i5 with the option of upgrading to the Core i7. Both offer up to 10-hour battery life. But the big feature is the one everyone’s been talking about for weeks: the Touch Bar. Replacing the function keys is a multi-touch Retina resolution strip. It replaces the function keys, but also changes to display keys and functions that are specific to the application you’re using. It incorporates a Touch ID sensor, for password-free unlocking and Apple Pay online purchases. AAPL also went with USB-C on the new MacBook Pro. But this time — unlike the old MacBook — there are four. So that’s four ports that can be used as any combination of USB, Thunderbolt 3 or power. A lot of MacBook Pro users are still going to have to invest in adapters for their peripherals, but at least they can connect more than one at a time. The company is also offering an entry level 13-inch MacBook Pro without that Touch Bar and just two USB-C ports. It’s thinner than the 13-inch MacBook Air and weighs the same three pounds. Pricing starts at $1,499 for the “budget” 13-inch MacBook Pro, $1,799 for the full featured version and $2,399 for the 15-inch new MacBook Pro. Pre-orders start today. In addtion to the new MacBook Pro, AAPL also discussed Apple TV at its event.

Three options for the 13-inch MacBook Pro and two for the 15-inch variant. (Image: Apple) At its October 27 'Hello Again' event, Apple has finally refreshed its MacBook Pro lineup. The thinnest and lightest MacBook Pro is here in 13-inch and 15-ich options. Not just that. The new MacBook Pro comes with an unique OLED Touch Bar which replaces the traditional function keys. The Touch Bar aims to bring the convenience of having a touch-based interface minus the huge touchscreen. There are five models of the MacBook Pro. Three options for the 13-inch MacBook Pro and two for the 15-inch variant. The cheapest MacBook Pro (13-inch) costs $1,499 and doesn't come with the Touch Bar with integrated Touch ID. To get the new Touch Bar, consumers will have to shed a minimum $1,799 . Also read: TV App for Apple TV Launched: What is it and What Can it do? "The Touch Bar places controls right at the user’s fingertips and adapts when using the system or apps like Mail, Finder, Calendar, Numbers, GarageBand, Final Cut Pro X and many more, including third-party apps. For example, the Touch Bar can show Tabs and Favorites in Safari, enable easy access to emoji in Messages, provide a simple way to edit images or scrub through videos in Photos and so much more," explained Apple in a release. Featuring an all-metal unibody body, the 13-inch variants are 17 percent thinner and 23 percent less volume than the previous generation, and weighs 1.3 kgs. The new 15-inch MacBook Pro, at just 15.5 mm thin, is 14 percent thinner and 20 percent less volume than before, and weighs 1.8 kgs. The Touch ID is also integrated into the power button. Once you enroll your fingerprint in Touch ID on your MacBook Pro, you can quickly unlock your Mac, switch user accounts and make secure purchases with Apple Pay on the web with a single touch. The Retina display on the new MacBook Pro at 500 nits of brightness, is 67 percent brighter than the previous generation. Hardware options include sixth-generation dual-core Core i5 with eDRAM, dual-core Core i7 with eDRAM and quad-core Core i7 Intel processors.

The 13-inch MacBook Pro comes with Intel Iris Graphics.

The Idle Power Use Of The Past 19 Linux Kernel Releases Written by Michael Larabel in Linux Kernel on 27 October 2016 at 03:30 PM EDT. 4 Comments This morning I published the Power Consumption and Efficiency Of The Linux Kernel For The Last Three Years article containing power consumption data for an Intel Haswell system going back to the Linux 3.11 kernel through Linux 4.9 Git. Those were some interesting power consumption numbers under load while here are the idle numbers. The idle tests were still running this morning so I opted to post them later since they're interested in their own right. The same i7-4790K system was used for benchmarking all of these kernels from Linux 3.11 to Linux 4.9 (25 October Git). No other changes were made during the testing process. Each kernel was freshly booted to the Unity desktop and then launched the idle power consumption test for a period of three minutes while monitoring the AC power draw as reported by the WattsUp Power meter. Automating this with the Phoronix Test Suite: MONITOR=sys.power phoronix-test-suite benchmark idle. Here are those idle power results for the Haswell system: The results fluctuated by a few Watts over the past three years of kernel releases but overall wasn't too dramatic for this Core i7 4780K system. There were spikes though to report from Linux 4.3 through Linux 4.5, but fortunately was addressed. The minimum power draw achieved was actually with Linux 4.6 but sadly didn't carry over through to the newer kernels. There's been a lot of work recently on P-State/CPUFreq, making use of scheduler utilization data, and other power management efforts but at the end of the day for this i7-4790K system it hasn't yielded any real shock. The idle data in full via this OpenBenchmarking.org result file. See the rest of the kernel power consumption benchmarks from this morning if you haven't already to see how the kernels compare under load and the performance-per-Watt. 4 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Taking to the stage at its "Hello Again" event in Cupertino, Tim Cook and chums announced a completely new MacBook Pro, simply called the MacBook Pro.  This new model for 2016 brings in a whole range of changes, sweeping the 2015 MacBook Pro model aside. Here's everything you need to know about the new MacBook Pro. Apple MacBook Pro (2016): Thinner, brighter, faster, and very touchy feely Apple MacBook Pro (2016) preview: Air apparent MacBook Pro (2016): Design Apple has announced a brand new design for its MacBook Pro family of devices, coming in 13 and 15-inch models. The new MacBook Pro (2016) evolves the unibody design of the previous MacBook Pro, sticking to the compact form factor, but reducing in size once again. It will be available in silver or grey. The new 13-inch MacBook Pro measures 14.9 x 304.1 x 212.4mm and weighs 1.37kg. The new 15-inch MacBook Pro measures 15.5 x 349.3 x 240.7mm and weighs 1.83kg. The reduction in volume as lead to a complete redesign for the internals, with a new cooling system to move air through the body and exhaust out the back. The display is as thin as the little 12-inch MacBook, while the Force Touch trackpad increases in size. However, the biggest changes are the stripping out of all the ports and replacing them with Thunderbolt 3 ports. The second biggest change is the inclusion of a new OLED Touch Bar, sitting in the space where the Fn keys used to sit. Unfortunately, to muddy the waters a little, the entry-level device is slightly lesser-specced, so although it sits in the same design, it only has two ports and no Touch Bar. This is the basic breakdown of new MacBook Pro models: 13-inch MacBook Pro, two Thunderbolt 3 ports 13-inch MacBook Pro, four Thunderbolt 3 ports, Touch Bar 15-inch MacBook Pro, four Thunderbolt 3 ports, touch Bar Pocket-lint MacBook Pro (2016): Touch Bar The Touch Bar is the real talking point of the new MacBook Pro, and likely to be the feature that sells this new design to a wide number of people. The Touch Bar replaces the Fn keys and is a second Retina display. This OLED panel supports up to 10-points of touch and is full colour, designed to change its options depending on what you're doing on your Mac. It will offer things like volume sliders, shortcuts in your browser, text predictions when typing and tools when using more advanced programs. For example, Apple demonstrated how Photoshop tools would appear on Touch Bar, how Microsoft Word tools could appear on the Touch Bar and how basic system controls could appear there too. There can also be a full emoji bar on Touch Bar, making it really easy to respond to messages with minimal fuss. The Touch Bar will also incorporate the power button, which also integrates Touch ID, with a secure chip in the MacBook Pro, meaning you can touch to make payments. Apple Touch Bar: What can I do with it and what apps are supported? MacBook Pro (2016): Specs and hardware The new MacBook Pros offer a range of Intel Core i CPUs, with a huge range of options for RAM, storage and on the larger model, GPUs. The basic 13-inch MacBook Pro (without Touch Bar) starts with a 2.0GHz Core i5, 256GB SSD storage and 8GB RAM. Graphics come from onboard Intel Iris 540. As we mentioned there are two Thunderbolt ports. It has a 2560 x 1600 pixel resolution display, 277ppi. The 13-inch MacBook Pro (with Touch Bar) starts with a 2.9GHz Core i5, 256GB SSD storage and 8GB RAM. Graphics are supplied by the Intel Iris 550. This model gets four Thunderbolt 3 ports. It has a 2560 x 1600 pixel resolution display, 277ppi. Finally the 15-inch MacBook Pro (with Touch Bar) starts with 2.6GHz Core i7, 256GB SSD storage and 16GB RAM. Graphics come from the AMD Radeon Pro 450 (2GB) with Intel HD Graphics 530. There are four Thunderbolt 3 ports. It has a 2880 x 1800 pixel resolution display, for 220ppi. MacBook Pro (2016): Release date and price The new MacBook Pro models are available to buy on from Apple today, with delivery depending on the model you choose. The basic 13-inch MacBook Pro is looking at delivery on 29 October, but the more advanced MacBook Pro models with Touch Bar are looking at 3-4 week delivery times. Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch: From £1,499 Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch with Touch Bar: From £1,749 Apple MacBook Pro 15-inch with Touch Bar: From £2,349 There are a wide range of configuration options that make the price vary huge amounts, running up to over £4000 for the top spec MacBook Pro 15-inch.

The laptop has a 2GHz dual-core Intel i5 processor with an Intel Iris Graphics 540 GPU. The computer also stocks 8GB of RAM and two Thunderbolt 3 ports — not four like its more expensive siblings. It also ditches the SD card slot found on the Macbook Air, which Apple continues to sell through its online store. The 13-inch MacBook Pro with function keys begins at $1,899 CAD, and begins shipping immediately.

Onstage at the company’s Fall event, Apple’s Phil Schiller revealed a new T1 chip, manufactured by Apple, that will bring the Secure Enclave on the new generation of laptops. iPhones and iPads have included Secure Enclave hardware for years, but this is the first instance of those protections on an Apple laptop. The T1 isn’t the main processor, and most functions will still rely on Intel’s Core i5 or i7chips, but including an Apple-made chip enables a number of important security features. Apple’s A7 chip — included in iPhones and iPads — is encoded with an inextractible private key at the factory, as part of the A7’s Secure Enclave. That private key is then used for a number of security functions, including decrypting iMessages. Previous MacBooks have typically stored private keys in software-accessible memory, a less secure alternative made necessary by reliance on third-party chips. Those features are particularly important for TouchID, which is built into the new MacBook Pro’s Touch Bar. That TouchID sensor, included on a MacBook for the first time, enables a single machine to switch between user accounts immediately after recognizing a registered print. The Secure Enclave’s protections are central to TouchID, ensuring that attackers can’t extract fingerprint information from the device, an attack that has been demonstrated on some Android phones.

Let’s have a look how it’s going to change computing. By: Rohit Arora Published: Thursday, October 27, 2016, 21:30 [IST] Microsoft at its 'What's next for Windows 10' event introduced several new innovative hardware products and also showcased what company is bringing to Windows 10 operating system. The highlight of the event was the new Surface Book, the new Surface Studio Machine and the Creator update for Windows 10, which will redefine the way artists and designers create digital art on touch screen devices. SEE ALSO: Moto M Leaked again: Live Images shows a new Metal Design, Android Marshmallow and more While it's too early to say when Microsoft will unveil them in the Indian market, let's find out what innovation they bring to table and how they will change the way we interact with computers. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! Create Digital Art in an all new way with Surface Studio Microsoft expanded the Surface family by introducing Surface Studio, a new class of device that transforms from a standard workstation into a digital canvas for artists and designers. It features an ultra-HD 4.5K screen, which as per Microsoft delivers 63 percent more pixels than a state-of-the-art 4K TV. The workstation offers an immersive way to create on the thinnest LCD monitor ever built. The Surface Studio works with pen, touch and Surface Dial- a new input device that lets you use two hands on the screen to compose and create in all new ways. Portable and Powerful Upgraded Surface Book Pro One of the most-anticipated product showcase at the event was new Surface Book Pro. Microsoft showcased three new Surface Book models that feature 6th Generation Intel CoreTM i7 processors and pack more than twice the graphics processing power as the original Surface Book. The new Surface Book claims to have 16 hours of battery life and offers the same sleek design As far as pricing goes, the new model is priced at $2399 (approximately Rs. 1,60,345) and will be available for preorders in the US now. There is no word about global availability of the product. Click Here For New Laptops Best Online Deals Windows 10 Creators Update is all you need Microsoft also showcased an update for Windows 10, which includes tools for creative professionals and artists. The free update will roll out in Spring 2017 and will enable Windows 10 users to create, share and experience in 3-D and mixed reality and will empower every gamer to be a broadcaster. The Creators Update will also make Microsoft Edge the first browser to fully embrace 3-D. Surface Dial- a new tool way to interact with Displays One of the most unique product that Microsoft showcased was- Surface Dial. It is a new peripheral designed for the creative process. The device works with Windows 10 and offers a more intuitive way to scroll, zoom and navigate. It brings a set of digital tools specific to the app open on Surface Studio, for example, Surface Dial allows artists to change the color or the size of their brush tip as they paint without ever moving the pen away from the screen. Windows 10 VR headset Last but not least, Microsoft has also unveiled the next generation Virtual Reality headset. The new headset will include inside-out tracking sensors, obviating the need for external cameras or laser systems like those on the current Oculus Rift or HTC Vive. This is once again a next step in Virtual reality technology. The new range of software and hardware products shown above, is Microsoft's bold attempt to change the way we interact with touch screen devices. In the words of Microsoft, the combination of Surface Dial, pen and touch creates a more immersive and tactile way for people to create in digital environments. Now all eyes are on Apple's upcoming MacBook, which is expected to launch soon and will be the right competitor for Microsoft's innovative products.

Then you should have all-in-ones near the top of your shopping list. Tucking all the hardware in behind the screen and abandoning the traditional tower is a great way of keeping things tidy, however limitations in size and cooling have historically restricted performance. Gamers, therefore, haven't shown a great deal of interest in all-in-one solutions, but things are beginning to change and with the 34in Fusion Curve, PC Specialist hopes to prove that streamlined gaming PCs are coming of age. It's certainly a looker. The large, ultra-wide 34in panel curves gently from left to right, creating the wrap-around environment that has proven successful on consumer displays. A reasonably slim 15mm bezel does little to detract from the overall effect, and though the 720p webcam jutting out from the top is a bit of an eye-sore, it can easily be removed to reveal a spare USB 3.0 port. The matte panel, identified as a Samsung LTM340YP01 a-Si TFT-LCD, offers a generous 3,440x1,440 resolution, decent viewing angles as well as good brightness (350cd/m2), a 3000:1 contrast ratio and a 60Hz refresh rate. It's an enjoyable place to be, but it's a sign of how far displays have come that the Fusion Curve arguably isn't breathtaking. If you're inclined to live near the bleeding edge, you may lament the lack of G-Sync, OLED contrast, or the ability to go beyond 100Hz. Build quality is a tale of two halves. The metal stand and front bezels provide a robust and sleek aesthetic, but around back the vented plastic cover doesn't exude the same level of quality. Attaching the heavy display to the stand is as easy as fastening a couple of screws, and we're impressed by how such a thin base can accommodate a screen as substantial as this. There are a couple of caveats, however, as while the stand allows for a small amount of tilt, there's no height adjustment nor swivel, making it tricky to find a sweet spot. Alternatively, a VESA mount is provided in the box for wall-mounting or compatibility with third-party stands. In terms of inputs and outputs, the power button is located on the underside, near the right corner, alongside a small joystick for navigating the panel's on-screen menus. In addition to the top USB 3.0 port, there are two further USB ports around back (1x 2.0, 1x 3.0), as well as an SD card reader and a pair of audio jacks. The rest of the connectivity options are determined by the motherboard, and seeing as this is a gaming PC first and foremost, let's take a peek under the hood. Undoing a dozen or so screws allows for the I/O cover and plastic shroud to be removed, revealing a busy interior with some truly high-end hardware. Our review sample's foundation is an Asus Z170I Pro Gaming mini-ITX motherboard, on top of which sits an Intel Core i7-6700K processor, 16GB of dual-channel Kingston HyperX Savage DDR4-2666 memory, and a 512GB Intel 600p M.2 SSD. That's already enough to put most all-in-ones to shame, yet there's also a 1TB WD Black hard disk for secondary storage, a low-profile liquid cooler attached to the CPU, a pair of basic stereo speakers, and last but certainly not least, an EVGA GeForce GTX 1080 FTW Gaming ACX 3.0 graphics card. A tantalising mix, and the Fusion Curve manages to shoehorn everything into a reasonably slim frame with some interesting cooling configurations. The CPU's liquid cooler is channelled to a top radiator measuring roughly 160mm x 40mm in size and aided by a centrifugal fan, while the graphics card points down, leading us to wonder whether or not a Founders Edition would have been a better fit in terms of airflow. Said graphics card's HDMI output is pre-plumbed to the display, while the two PSUs (a 120W unit for the screen and a 450W unit for the PC) are daisy-chained to require only a single mains power cable. Handy, though do note that the power port and motherboard connectors aren't the easiest to reach when the display is up and running - we found it simpler to connect the cables prior to attaching the stand. PC Specialist backs the entire system with a three-year warranty, but all-in-ones tend not to come cheap, and Fusion Curve is no exception. Our review sample fetches £2,449, which is at least a couple of hundred pounds more than a similarly-powered desktop combined with a standalone 34in ultra-wide display. Such a premium is not unexpected, and the real question here is whether or not the components can live comfortably in seemingly tight confines.

And it looks a lot like last year's model. The company introduced a refreshed Surface Book i7 during its hardware event in New York City, where we got a chance to play with the device for a few minutes. Microsoft told us the laptop-tablet hybrid has more battery life and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M GPU. It's claiming up to 16 hours of battery life in total, which is helped by a redesigned cooling system. Because of that system, the Surface Book i7 is actually heavier. The 2016 Surface Book has been redesigned "from the outside in". It added a cooling fan and a pair of hyperbolic cooling fans at the back to keep temps down. While the trend is to go thinner and lighter every year when it comes to laptops (and mobile devices in general), Microsoft upped the weight from 3.48 pounds to 3.63 and made it slightly thicker. Microsoft October Event: All the announcements that matter Pocket-lint While the new Surface Book lacks Intel's latest Kaby Lake processors, graphics have been doubled compared to the original model. RAM also sits at 2GB. Microsoft claimed you'll get more than three times the power of the current MacBook Pro 13-inch. So, all you're getting with this update is more graphics power and battery. It's not an exactly an overhaul, to say the least. But, if it’s not broke, don’t fix it. We guess. Microsoft told us the request it received the most was to up the battery power and graphics. Instead of adding a bunch of new features, it did exactly that. Though it may be a little heavier and thicker, you don't really notice. It still looks great visually. We used it with the Pen, and the device worked smoothly. When writing with Pen, it had the feel of using a pencil on paper, but you have the ability to change what you are writing at any time and with more options. Pocket-lint First Impressions Microsoft went pretty simple here - upgrading a few things that are important to any user. However, it did add what was created for other devices, such as the Surface Studio, like the use of 3D and the Surface Dial. Though Microsoft only demoed the Dial on the Surface Studio, it does work on the Surface Book, as well as the Surface Pro 3 and Surface Pro 4. You can read more about what we thought of the Dial in our Studio hands-on. If you're in the market for the latest and greatest from Redmond, the updated Surface Book will be available on 10 November in 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB configurations. It'll cost $2,399, $2,799, and $3,299, respectively.

The Applied Research Competition is a prestigious contest for graduate and doctoral level security researchers who have published papers in the past year. The Policy Competition, in its third year, challenges students to propose public policy solutions to real-world computer security challenges. The CSAW Policy Competition is organized by the NYU Center for Cybersecurity. As CSAW expands this year to include on-site competition hubs in the United Arab Emirates and at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, finalists in the Applied Research Competition — one of six CSAW contests — will compete at NYU Tandon in Brooklyn and at NYU Abu Dhabi. Ten papers on the application of security technology, the implementation of security systems, or lessons learned made the final round in the United States. CSAW Applied Research finalists, listed with the student author presenting the work at CSAW, followed by other contributing authors are: Acing the IOC Game: Toward Automatic Discovery and Analysis of Open-Source Cyber Threat IntelligenceStudent Presenter: Kan Yuan (Indiana University, Bloomington) Xiaojing Liao and Raheem Beyah (Georgia Institute of Technology), Xiaofeng Wang and Luyi Xing (Indiana University, Bloomington), Zhou Li (ACM member) TrackMeOrNot: Enabling Flexible Control on Web TrackingStudent Presenter: Wei Meng (Georgia Institute of Technology) Byoungyoung Lee and Wenke Lee (Georgia Institute of Technology), Xinyu Xing (Pennsylvania State University) Measuring and Mitigating AS-level Adversaries Against TorStudent Presenter: Oleksii Starov (Stony Brook University) Risah Nithyanand (Stony Brook University), Adva Zair and Michael Schapira (Hebrew University Jerusalem), and Phillipa Gill (University of Massachusetts) Trusted Browsers for Uncertain TimesStudent Presenter: David Kohlbrenner (University of California, San Diego) Hovav Shacham (University of California, San Diego) Towards SDN-Defined Programmable BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) SecurityStudent Presenter: Sungmin Hong (Texas A&M University) Robert Baykov, Lei Xu, Srinath Nadimpalli, and Guofei Gu (Texas A&M University) Hidden Voice CommandsStudent Presenter: Tavish Vaidya (Georgetown University) Nicholas Carlini, Pratyush Mishra, and David Wagner (University of California, Berkeley), Yuankai Zhang, Micah Sherr, Clay Shields, and Wenchao Zhou (Georgetown University) One Bit Flips, One Cloud Flops: Cross-VM Row Hammer Attacks and Privilege EscalationStudent Presenter: Yuan Xiao (The Ohio State University) Xiaokuan Zhang, Yinqian Zhang, and Radu Teodorescu (The Ohio State University) APISan: Sanitizing API Usages through Semantic Cross-CheckingStudent Presenter: Insu Yun (Georgia Institute of Technology) Yeongjin Jang, Taesoo Kim, and Changwoo Min (Georgia Institute of Technology), Xujie Si and Mayur Naik (University of Pennsylvania) A Principled Approach for ROP DefenseStudent Presenter: Rui Qiao (Stony Brook University) R Sekar (Stony Brook University), Mingwei Zhang (Intel Labs) SPIFFY: Inducing Cost-Detectability Tradeoffs for Persistent Link-Flooding AttacksStudent presenter: Min Suk Kang (Carnegie Mellon University) Virgil D. Gligor and Vyas Sekar (Carnegie Mellon University) "We chose research finalists based on innovative ideas that top industry security researchers thought might someday transform our approach to securing their systems," said Damon McCoy, assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at NYU Tandon School of Engineering, and CSAW Applied Research Competition faculty mentor.

"The rapidly evolving cybersecurity landscape has raised questions about how much money companies should spend on data security," said Kevin Kirby, a third-year student at the NYU School of Law and student leader of the CSAW Policy Competition. "We asked our competitors for policy proposals that would ensure that the true costs of data insecurity are allocated appropriately." The University of Illinois and the United States Naval Academy will return as finalists once again this year after placing among the podium finishers in both 2014 and 2015. All finalists will present a revised and expanded version of their first-round proposal to a panel of experts who will evaluate the feasibility of the authors' proposals, the creativity of their ideas, and their understanding of the issues at play.

Those companies include Google, Salesforce, Intel and Kaiser Permanente, which is based in Oakland. Glassdoor, the Bay Area-based jobs site that collects anonymous employee ratings of their companies, bosses and more, today published a survey of the 25 highest-rated companies for vacation and paid time off. No. 1 on the list is Thousand Oaks-based biotech company Amgen, with a 4.7 out of 5 rating. Internet giant Google, based in Mountain View, was the highest-rated Bay Area company on the list, at No. 4 with a 4.5 rating. Employees start off with three weeks of vacation, which tops out at five weeks, they said on Glassdoor, noting that managers are pretty good about letting people take that time. Employees also can take up to three months of sabbatical. “I get plenty of vacation time.” one Googler wrote on Glassdoor. “My wife and I have trouble figuring out how we’re going to use it all.” Salesforce wasn’t far behind at No. 6 with a 4.4 rating. Employees of the San Francisco cloud company reported three to four weeks of paid time off, along with four floating holidays and six paid volunteering days. Directors and above can have unlimited time off, they tell Glassdoor. The next Bay Area company on the list, healthcare provider Kaiser, got employee kudos for its “extremely generous PTO” policy, which is based on the number of years of service with the company. Employees also reported being able to roll over and sell unused time. Intel, at No. 18 on the list, got a 4.3 rating. The Santa Clara chip company’s employees reported three to four weeks of vacation, plus a sabbatical program. Other household names on the list include Ikea, Microsoft, Costco and General Motors. To be considered for Glassdoor’s survey, companies must have received at least 30 ratings about vacation and paid time off, and have an overall company rating of at least 3.5 as of Sept. 29.

GREGORY BULL , THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Chip maker Qualcomm is buying NXP Semiconductors N.V. in a deal valued at approximately $38.1 billion announced Thursday. GREGORY BULL , THE ASSOCIATED PRESS By CHAD BRAY / THE NEW YORK TIMES Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF Qualcomm said Thursday that it had agreed to acquire NXP Semiconductors for $38.5 billion, the latest deal in the rapidly shrinking chip industry. Semiconductor makers are betting on the so-called internet of things: the digitalization of everyday products like watches, refrigerators and cars. But the industry has been hurt by higher costs and pricing pressure, which have eroded profit margins. The environment has prompted a wave of consolidation. In July, SoftBank of Japan agreed to acquire ARM Holdings, a British chip designer, for $32 billion. Last year, Avago Technologies bought Irvine-based Broadcom for $37 billion, and Intel paid nearly $17 billion for Altera. In March 2015, NXP made its own deal, buying a smaller peer, Freescale Semiconductor, for $11.8 billion. The merger with NXP would extend the reach of the Qualcomm, which is based in San Diego. Qualcomm primarily designs and makes chips for smartphones. NXP, which has its headquarters in the Netherlands and trades on Nasdaq, is a major supplier of chips used in near-field communications, which let phones interact wirelessly with equipment such as payment terminals. Qualcomm said it expected to generate $500 million in annual cost savings within two years after the transaction closes. The combined company would have more than $30 billion in annual revenue. “The NXP acquisition accelerates our strategy to extend our leading mobile technology into robust new opportunities, where we will be well positioned to lead by delivering integrated semiconductor solutions at scale,” Steve Mollenkopf, the Qualcomm chief executive, said in a news release. Under the terms of the deal, NXP investors would receive $110 in cash for each share they own. That represents an 11 percent premium to NXP’s closing price Wednesday. Including the assumption of debt, the deal is valued at $47 billion. Standard & Poor’s Global Market Intelligence says it is the largest European technology deal ever. News that the companies were in talks emerged last month. The transaction, which is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval, is expected to close by the end of 2017. “United in a common strategy, the complementary nature of our technologies and the scale of our portfolios will give us the ability to drive an accelerated level of innovation and value for the whole ecosystem,” said Richard L. Clemmer, the NXP chief executive. Digital & Driveway Delivery - 50% Off Most Popular Boeing to shift 2,500 jobs away from Huntington Beach, with 1,600 heading to L.A.

The organizations said the merger will advance interoperability between connected devices from both groups, to help achieve the full operating potential of the IoT. The newly merged groups will collaborate on future OCF specifications, as well as the IoTivity and AllJoyn open source projects. The expanded OCF board of directors will consist of executives from a wide array of leading companies, including AB Electrolux, Canon, Cisco Systems, GE Digital, Haier, Intel, LG Electronics, Microsoft, Qualcomm, and Samsung Electronics. OCF will now sponsor both the IoTivity and AllJoyn open source projects at The Linux Foundation. Both projects will collaborate to support future versions of the OCF specification in a single IoTivity implementation that combines the best of both technologies into a unified solution. Current devices running on either AllJoyn or IoTivity solutions will be interoperable and backward-compatible. Companies already developing IoT solutions based on either technology can proceed knowing that their products will be compatible with a unified IoT standard. “By coming together as one group, we are able to make IoT a more seamless, secure experience for everyone involved, from developers to end users,” said Danny Lousberg, chairperson of the AllSeen Alliance. “The AllSeen Alliance and Open Connectivity Foundation have been working together closely to deliver a technologically comprehensive solution that makes sense for the industry and our members.” The merger is designed to leverage the strengths of each organization. The AllSeen Alliance brings its diverse global membership, proven AllJoyn technology, and millions of AllJoyn-enabled products into the market through the AllJoyn Certified program. OCF brings its deep membership roster, formal IoT standards with expertise across multiple vertical markets, and cloud-native architecture as implemented within the IoTivity framework. Together, these strengths create an organization that establishes the broad interoperability needed to realize the full market potential for IoT. “We’re incredibly excited about this unification as both groups have been working diligently to make this possible,” said Mike Richmond, executive director, Open Connectivity Foundation. “As we forge onwards towards this shared goal, we are focused on building the most robust, open IoT software solution to achieve our vision — complete interoperability within the IoT.” For more information, visit www.openconnectivity.org.

The surprising reason why the new MacBook Pro doesn't have (much) more battery life 0 Share: Laptops by Sean Hollister October 27, 2016 8:35 AM PDT @starfire2258 Up Next Does the internet have a fake-news problem? Apple debuts MacBook Pro Apple announces its lightest, thinnest notebook ever. The new laptop features an all-metal design, a Touch Bar, and it comes in two sizes, 13-inch and 15-inch. It also comes in two colors, silver and space gray. 2:05 Close Drag Everybody wants more battery life. And sometimes, you can get it -- but if you were expecting many hours of additional battery life from a new 15-inch MacBook Pro, you'll be disappointed. Apple quotes a 10 hour battery life for the new MacBook Pro, whether you pick the 13- or 15-inch model. That's not just respectable -- it's good, particularly for a laptop with a quad-core CPU. But last year, the MacBook Pro got 9 to 10 hours. It's not a lot more. Part of that's because the new MacBook Pro is thinner, and has a smaller battery pack inside. But you know what? Even if Apple wanted to make the battery bigger, the company couldn't do it. I know that's a bold claim, and Apple's engineers have done seemingly impossible things before. But I'm not talking about science -- I'm talking about the law. It's illegal to carry a laptop on an airplane with a battery capacity greater than 100 watt-hours -- and last year's 15-inch MacBook Pro already had a 99.5 watt-hour power pack. I'm not sure why 100 watt-hours is the limit, and not 99 or 103, but it's been the rule in many countries (including the US) for a number of years. Lithium-ion batteries are considered hazardous materials, because of their ability to explode, and so generally you can only carry one internal up-to-100Wh battery and a couple of up-to-160Wh removable spares on a flight now. Enlarge Image See those giant silver palmrests? It's all battery under there.Photo by Sarah Tew/CNET Of course, a bigger battery isn't the only way to improve battery life. Engineers can swap out circuits for more efficient ones, or improve the display. Apple did both with the new MacBook Pro, in fact, with new Intel processors and a 30 percent more efficient backlight for its high-res screen. Apple might have gone even a bit further if it had access to Intel's latest chips -- the Kaby Lake ones -- but they aren't yet ready in the more powerful configurations Apple prefers for its MacBook Pro. (They're due early next year.)

(In an earlier version of this article, that's exactly what I predicted wouldn't happen, and I'll be glad to be proven wrong.) This way, the company has a bit more headroom to improve battery life over the next few years, without hitting that 100 watt-hour wall. Check out all of today's Apple news here. Update, 5:45 p.m. PT: Rewritten after Apple's event, to reflect that Apple actually managed to reduce the size of the battery.

The Current Picks Dwayne Johnson is 'People' Magazine's Sexiest Man Alive Arnold Schwarzenegger: "Republicans and Democrats Have to Live in This World Together" SPIES Unbreakable Code: Chasing an Intelligence Specialist Gone Rogue By  Yudhijit Bhattacharjee On the morning of the first Monday in December 2000, FBI Special Agent Steven Carr hurried out of his cubicle at the bureau’s Washington, D.C. field office and bounded down two flights of stairs to pick up a package that had just arrived by FedEX from FBI New York. Carr was 38 years old, of medium build, with blue eyes and a handsome face. He was thoughtful and intense, meticulous in his work, driven by a sense of patriotic duty inherited from his father — who served in World War II — and his maternal and paternal grandfathers — who both fought in World War I. Because of his aptitude for deduction and his intellectual doggedness, he’d been assigned to counterintelligence within a year after coming to the FBI in 1995. Carr laid out the contents of the package in front of him: a sheaf of papers running into a few dozen pages. They were from three envelopes that had been handed to FBI New York by a confidential informant at the Libyan consulate in New York. The envelopes had been individually mailed to the consulate by an unknown sender. Breathlessly, Carr thumbed through the sheets. Based on directions sent from New York, he was able to sort the papers into three sets corresponding to the three envelopes. All three had an identical cover sheet, at the top of which was a warning in all caps. “THIS LETTER CONTAINS SENSITIVE INFORMATION.” Below, it read, in part: “This letter is confidential and directed to your President or Intelligence Chief. Please pass this letter via diplomatic pouch and do not discuss the existence of this letter in your offices or homes or via any electronic means. If you do not follow these instructions the existence of this letter and its contents may be detected and collected by U.S. intelligence agencies.” In the first envelope was a four-page letter with 149 lines of typed text consisting of letters and numbers. The second envelope included instructions on how to decode the letter. The third envelope included two sets of code sheets. One set contained a list of ciphers. The other, running to six pages, listed dozens of words along with their encoded abbreviations: a system commonly known as brevity codes. Together, the two sets were meant to serve as the key for the decryption. Carr flipped through the letter, skimming the alphanumeric sequence. It looked like gibberish, like text you might get if you left a curious monkey in front of a keyboard. There was no way to make sense of it without the code sheets and the decoding instructions. By mailing the three separately, the sender had sought to secure the communication against the possibility that one envelope might get intercepted by a U.S. intelligence agency. Carr saw that the sender had included a message in typed, plain text in each envelope, informing the consulate of the other two envelopes in the mail and instructing the receiver of the message to place a car ad in the Washington Post if any of the other envelopes failed to arrive. The sender had not anticipated that all three envelopes could fall into the FBI’s hands. FBI New York had already decoded a few lines of the letter. Carr’s pulse quickened further as he read the deciphered text. “I am a Middle East North African analyst for the Central Intelligence Agency. I am willing to commit espionage against the U.S. by providing your country with highly classified information. I have a top secret clearance and have access to documents of all of the U.S. intelligence agencies, National Security Agency (NSA), Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), Central Command (CENTCOM) as well as smaller agencies.” To prove that this wasn’t a bluff, the sender had included in all three envelopes an identical set of government documents, 23 pages in all, some marked “CLASSIFIED SECRET,” some “CLASSIFIED TOP SECRET.” Most of them were aerial images taken by U.S. spy satellites, showing military sites in the Middle East and other parts of the world: air defense systems, weapons depots, munitions factories, underground bunkers. Some of the documents were intelligence reports about regimes and militaries in the Middle East. It was evident from the markings on these images and reports that they had been printed after being downloaded from Intel Link, a classified network of servers that constituted the intelligence community’s Internet. There were some additional documents. One was a monthly newsletter of the CIA, circulated internally among agency employees. Another was the table of contents of the Joint Service Tactical Exploitation of National Systems, a classified manual to help the U.S. warfighter take advantage of the country’s reconnaissance satellites and other intelligence-gathering technologies. The manual had been compromised before by another spy — an NSA cryptologist named David Sheldon Boone, who had sold it to the Soviet Union a decade earlier. In the years since, as the United States reconnaissance capabilities had evolved, the manual had been updated a number of times. The table of contents the sender had included in the package were from the manual’s most recent version. It would be valuable even to an adversary already in possession of the JTENS that Boone had given away. Also among the documents were aerial photographs of Gaddafi’s yacht in the Mediterranean Ocean. They had been taken from a low-flying aircraft deployed not by the United States but by a foreign intelligence service. How the sender of the package could have acquired them was unclear. Carr studied the pages in stunned silence, oblivious to the comings and goings of colleagues around him. He had never seen anything like this before. Since joining the squad, he had followed up on dozens of letters tipping the FBI off to potential espionage. Most came from anonymous sources at U.S. intelligence agencies accusing a co-worker or colleague of being a spy. Rarely did such “point and pin” letters lead to the discovery of a real threat: more often than not, they turned out to be a case of erroneous judgment by the tipster, or a case of bitter workplace jealousy. What Carr had in front of him seemed anything but a false alarm. The sender of the envelopes was no doubt a bona fide member of the U.S. intelligence community, with access to “top secret” documents, intent on establishing a clandestine relationship with a foreign intelligence service. The person had, in fact, already committed espionage by giving classified information to an enemy country. Carr might as well have been looking at a warning sign for a national security threat flashing in neon red. Despite his excitement, Carr filed the sheets neatly into a binder before stepping into his supervisor’s office. “Lydia,” he said, sliding the binder across her desk. “You have to look at this.” Jechorek leafed through the pages. A short-haired, bespectacled woman in her early 50s, her quiet manner belied a tough-as-nails personality. She had gotten hooked to law enforcement early in life; joining her father — a police officer — on surveillance runs and drawing sketches of murder suspects while still a sophomore in high school. Now a veteran of counterintelligence, Jechorek was best known for having led the FBI’s investigation of Jonathan Pollard, the spy who was caught selling U.S. secrets to Israel in the '80s. Carr explained to her why FBI New York had couriered the pages to Washington. In the portion of the coded letter that agents in New York had deciphered, they had found an email address the sender wanted to use for further communication. With special permission from the U.S. Attorney General, the nation’s top law enforcement official, the agents asked the email service provider to let them pry into the account: jacobscall@mail.com. They discovered that the account had been created four months earlier, on August 3, using Internet access from a public library in Prince George’s County, Maryland. In the account registration, the user had identified himself as “Steven Jacobs,” having a residential address in Alexandria, Virginia. The account had been accessed half a dozen times from public libraries around Washington, D.C. There were no emails in the account except for test messages the person had sent to himself, and a reply from the Fraud Bureau in response to an inquiry he had made about an online company that sold fake IDs. From the accesses, the New York agents were certain that the individual lived somewhere in the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. “What are we going to do?” Jechorek asked, the urgency in her tone mirroring Carr’s. It was imperative that the FBI find this person as quickly as possible. Perhaps it was already too late. Carr showed her a matrix of clues he’d built from his gleaning of the pages. The system of brevity codes the sender had used — along with the concern for operational security — pointed to somebody with a military background. That surmise was founded on Carr’s own experience in the military: before coming to the FBI, he had spent 11 years in the U.S. Army and the National Guard, where he had used brevity codes in training exercises to communicate with fellow troops. In Carr’s estimation, the sender of the envelopes likely had a more sophisticated knowledge of cryptology than just brevity codes. He had a “top secret” security clearance, which was marginally helpful, since it reduced the potential suspect pool from a few hundred thousand workers in the U.S. intelligence community who have a “secret” security clearance to a more limited population, on the order of tens of thousands, with the higher level of clearance. He also had access to Intel Link. And he was likely married, with children, as evidenced by a line in the letter, stating: “If I commit espionage, I will be putting myself and family at great risk.” There was one other thing: The man was a terrible speller. Scanning the six pages of brevity codes, Carr spotted one misspelled word after another. The sender had evidently put this codebook together by first printing out the typed letter in plaintext, then cutting out individual words and pasting them alongside abbreviations that he’d printed out separately on other sheets. Carr could deduce that because the words didn’t line up perfectly with the individual abbreviations. But the disorderliness in alignment was hardly as glaring as the misspellings, though. Here was a person who had gone to great lengths to accomplish “op sec,” but failed to run a basic spellcheck. For the moment, though, Carr was focused on another set of clues: the locations of the public libraries the sender had accessed the jacobscall email account from. He’d marked them with pins on a large map of the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. The pins were clustered in and around the towns of Bowie and Crofton in Maryland. The intelligence agency in closest proximity was the National Security Agency. Located in Fort Meade, Maryland, the NSA has thousands of military employees, many with a background in cryptology, many with homes in the towns of Bowie and Crofton. Carr’s hunch was that the mole was likely from within the NSA’s ranks, even though he’d introduced himself as a CIA analyst. That line — and the CIA newsletter in the materials he had sent — was possibly a red herring. “We need to call Mac,” Carr said. Jechorek picked up the phone and dialed Robert McCaslin, the head of counterintelligence at the NSA. “Hello,” McCaslin answered. An old-timer in counterintelligence circles, he spoke with the deep authoritative voice of someone who’s not used to being challenged. “I’d like to come over to talk to you about an important matter,” Jechorek said. “I’m really busy right now,” he replied. “The earliest we can do it is tomorrow.” Jechorek, who didn’t know McCaslin too well, was reluctant to press him further. She hung up. “What did he say?” Carr asked her. “He says he can’t see us until tomorrow.” “Tomorrow? You got to call him back.” Jechorek studied the binder for a few moments. Then she reached for the phone and punched “redial.” “Hi, Lydia,” McCaslin answered, tersely. “We are coming to see you right now,” Jechorek said. Her tone was polite but firm. McCaslin knew at once that this couldn’t wait. “Ok, we’ll clear our schedule,” he said.   From THE SPY WHO COULDN'T SPELL: A Dyslexic Traitor, an Unbreakable Code, and the FBI's Hunt for America's Stolen Secrets by Yudhijit Bhattacharjee, to be published on November 1 by New American Library, an imprint of Penguin Publishing Group, a division of Penguin Random House LLC.

The bid for NXP is the largest transaction in the history of the semiconductor industry, requiring approval from the European Commission, the EU’s competition watchdog, and other global merger authorities. For Qualcomm, it will mean going cap in hand to Brussels to get its deal through just as it fights two EU antitrust cases that could lead to possible fines as soon as next year. NXP, the biggest supplier of chips used in the automotive industry, also had a history with the EU before it was dropped from a probe into a cartel for smart cards. But that doesn’t mean regulators are likely to give the merger a hard time. "The commission will use its knowledge of these companies and does take account, in merger-control reviews, of the past behavior of the firms in the market," said Matthew Hall, a lawyer at McGuireWoods LLP in Brussels. "That said, for these two companies, either nothing was proven or the investigation has not yet been concluded. So, the knowledge would probably only be used as background" to help frame questions or analysis. Nine Jurisdictions Qualcomm expects to close the bid for NXP late next year, Steve Mollenkopf, the company’s chief executive officer, said on a conference call with analysts and investors. The timeline reflects a lengthy regulatory approval process as the companies seek clearance in nine jurisdictions. Exclusive insights in your inbox, from our technology reporters around the world.

Intel Corp. got a quick clearance in 2011 for its acquisition of security firm McAfee despite taking investigators to court over a record 1.06 billion-euro ($1.16 billion) fine levied two years before. Microsoft Corp. won fast approval to buy both Skype and Nokia’s handset business despite being probed for more than a decade and paying more than 2 billion euros in antitrust fines. San Diego-based Qualcomm didn’t respond to requests for comment. Eindhoven, Netherlands-based NXP and the commission declined to comment. ‘Clear Ride’ "Qualcomm is going to have a reasonably clear ride because the product lines are relatively complementary," said Malcolm Penn, the chief executive officer of Future Horizons, a British semiconductor analyst firm. "It’s very hard to see where the European Commission would find it unpalatable." Penn sees only a limited overlap in the two companies’ operations in near-field communications technology where NXP’s business is "completely different to what Qualcomm does." The deal wouldn’t distort the European competitive environment nor is it likely to harm customers who have other suppliers to choose from, he said. In the meantime, Qualcomm will be battling the EU over formal complaints it received last year that target sales tactics that regulators say aimed to crush rivals. It will defend itself at a hearing next month over alleged below-cost pricing of chips for mobile Internet dongles and is also fighting a parallel case over exclusivity payments to an unidentified manufacturer of phones and tablets. Qualcomm has previously faced off with the EU and come out smiling. The EU closed a four-year probe in 2009 that focused on royalties the company charged for technology used in the 3G mobile-phone standard. Regulators said at the time that they were abandoning the probe after companies withdrew their complaints. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Photo by CNBC. Watch in Times Video » embed LONDON — Qualcomm said on Thursday that it had agreed to acquire NXP Semiconductors for $38.5 billion, the latest deal in the rapidly consolidating chip industry. Semiconductor makers are betting on the so-called internet of things — the connection of everyday products like watches, refrigerators and cars to the internet — and NXP makes the type of chips that are commonly used in this growing market. Qualcomm, based in San Diego, primarily designs and makes chips for smartphones. It can use NXP to significantly extend its reach, potentially supplying chips that are used in devices like payment terminals and cars. The NXP deal could also help Qualcomm combat higher costs and pricing pressure, which have eroded profit margins in the chip industry as demand for personal computers and smartphones has waned. Qualcomm “is trying to diversify away from smartphones,” said Mark Hung, an analyst with Gartner. “This speaks to creating interesting new devices.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story The chip industry has had a wave of acquisitions as demand for traditional kinds of chips has slowed. In the last two years, more than $100 billion has been spent in just four deals, including Qualcomm’s acquisition of NXP. In July, SoftBank of Japan agreed to acquire ARM Holdings, a British chip designer, for $32 billion. Last year, Avago Technologies bought Broadcom for $37 billion, and Intel paid nearly $17 billion for Altera. In March 2015, NXP made its own deal, buying a smaller peer, Freescale Semiconductor, for $11.8 billion. “There were a lot of different suppliers, a lot of competition” in the old world, Derek Aberle, president of Qualcomm, said in an interview. Now, “it’s not enough to deliver a piece of silicon. You have to offer complex solutions, at a large scale,” he said. Photo Maurice Geraets of NXP Semiconductors installing the mileage charging system device in his car. NXP is a major supplier of chips used in near-field communications. Credit Michel deGroot for The New York Times One of the biggest new markets for chip makers is automobiles and autonomous vehicles, and NXP’s chips are used for things like running a car’s internal network of electronics. NXP, which is based in the Netherlands and trades on Nasdaq, also makes chips for secure credit cards. Mr. Aberle said last week’s large-scale disruption of the internet, caused largely by hackers exploiting security flaws in connected devices, showed opportunities in this market. Qualcomm said it expected to achieve $500 million in annual cost savings within two years after the transaction closes. The combined company would have more than $30 billion in annual revenue. “The NXP acquisition accelerates our strategy to extend our leading mobile technology into robust new opportunities, where we will be well positioned to lead by delivering integrated semiconductor solutions at scale,” Steve Mollenkopf, the Qualcomm chief executive, said in a statement. Under the terms of the deal, NXP investors would receive $110 in cash for each share they own. That represents an 11-percent premium to NXP’s closing price on Wednesday. Including the assumption of debt, the deal is valued at $47 billion. Standard & Poor’s Global Market Intelligence said it would be the largest European technology deal ever. Advertisement Continue reading the main story News that the companies were talking emerged last month. The transaction, which is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval, is expected to close by the end of 2017. “United in a common strategy, the complementary nature of our technologies and the scale of our portfolios will give us the ability to drive an accelerated level of innovation and value for the whole ecosystem,” said Richard L. Clemmer, the NXP chief executive. But Qualcomm has a spotty track record on big mergers, Mr. Hung noted, and NXP has things like manufacturing centers in which Qualcomm has no experience. “It’s definitely a high-risk-high-reward move for them,” Mr. Hung said. Some of the risk is eased, Mr. Aberle said, because Qualcomm can pay for part of the deal with the cash it has overseas, in excess of $25 billion. Follow Chad Bray on Twitter @Chadbray.

Total funding is now, Cloudian says, $79m, and the cash is going to be used for software engineering, expanding sales and marketing, and building out its international operations. The funding round included all the existing investors: Intel Capital, INCJ, Eight Roads (the proprietary investment arm of FIL, Fidelity International Limited), and Goldman Sachs. Plus four new investors: Lenovo, City National Bank, Epsilon Venture Partners, and DVP Investment. Lenovo OEMs Cloudian HyperStore software in its DX8200C product. Cloudian was a niche player in a recent Gartner MQ, but a highly ranked one. Some object storage startup funding totals: Amplidata – $44.5m and bought by HGST in March 2015 Bycast – $14m and bought by NetApp in 2010 Caringo – $33m Cleversafe – $135.4m and bought by IBM in October 2015 Cloudian – $79m Exablox – $45.5m Scality – $90m SwiftStack – $23.6m Comment Cloudian’s VCs must think there is still great potential in object storage. Their endgame, their object even, might be an acquisition as the idea of a standalone object storage startup having an IPO looks a bit of a stretch. Potential acquirers could include Cisco, HPE and Lenovo, but not Dell EMC or NetApp. These three potential buyers could have Cloudian, Scality and SwiftStack on their shopping lists, which looks fetchingly symmetrical, three for three, but that very tidiness looks unreal.

Smart cities have been viewed by sceptics as a futuristic concept with little evidence to suggest their coming to reality. However, smart cities, whether built from the ground up or the top down are coming. Therefore, while town planners and OEMs are addressing challenges in terms of liability, insurance, connectivity and hardware, smart cities and the Internets of Things that will make them tick have attracted the gaze of another group of stakeholders: the IT and storage infrastructure industry. Gartner has predicted that 1.6 billion ‘things’ will be connected to the larger smart city infrastructure by the end of this year. Ever increasing numbers of towns and cities are implementing smart transport networks. They are allowing connected cars on their streets, while bins with trash monitoring sensors are no longer an alien concept. Processor giant Intel is talking about a future where everything is smart and connected. With the backing of key industry stakeholders all of these connected objects, right down to the bin, are creating, storing, accessing and reacting to their environment, creating data at an incredible pace. There is no doubt that South African cities would benefit from pervasive high-speed connectivity, which is the catalyst of and foundation for the development of a smart city if it is coupled with innovative thinking, planning, leadership and investment. In light of this, South Africa’s National Development Plan has identified all the components of a smart city as key developmental points for creating a globally competitive location and the country has kick started technology advances in support of smart innovation districts. For example, the City of Tshwane has partnered with Project Isizwe to provide wi-fi hotspots in public spaces, concentrating on low-income areas. In this project which has earned the title of the largest government-funded wi-fi project in Africa, 715 free wi-fi spots are already in place and the number is growing rapidly. The City of Cape Town is also making great strides towards this digital shift. In its ‘Smart Cape Project’, the Mother City will spend R185 million in 2015/16 for broadband infrastructure, and R23.7 million for the Digital Inclusion Project (Wi-Fi). Furthermore, the city will establish 300 Wi-Fi access points by the end of 2016 to unlock pervasive high-speed connectivity. With a foundation of high speed connectivity, businesses may transition to technologies like cloud as the initial steps towards becoming a smart city. Every inch of the smart city is about speed and understanding. Dealing with the tremendous volume and velocity of the data produced in real-time by every process from changing traffic lights to domestic smart meters is one issue – and a major undertaking. However, the concept of smart city is not just that everything is connected and churning out data. It has to be smart – a living, breathing entity that gathers and acts on intelligence and insight as part of an ongoing cycle. Therefore, this data not only needs to be stored, but it needs to be accessed, organised and used. Real-time data analytics and asset-intelligence solutions will have their day with the age of smart cities. It is crucial that the data produced is used to identify trends and anomalies in the everyday workings of the smart city to stimulate the innovation of new solutions that improve the smart citizens’ experience. Data city centres To deal with the day-to-day and long-term data demands of a smart city, massive amounts of data need to be stored cheaply, locally and with rapid access. This requires a unique approach to where data lives and is operated. One of the challenges smart cities poses for IT and storage infrastructure decision makers is an environmental one. There is a tendency to assume that dramatic increases in data volume will be accompanied by a huge upsurge in data centre footprint, which from a power usage and preservation perspective is undesirable. The counter balance to this is that we are seeing huge reductions in the footprint of drives required to store data. Data management vendors such as NetApp contribute significantly by offering efficiency functionalities and improvements with things like compression, deduplication, integration of object and cloud repositories When one considers the diverse nature of the data produced by an entire city, it is clear that a sophisticated and flexible storage infrastructure will be required. A significant percentage of the data produced by smart cities will be useless, and, therefore, to protect the mission-critical data sets this huge volume of historical data will need to be easily archived or destroyed. Furthermore, data needs to be accessed, moved around and analysed quickly as well as stored on mass. NetApp’s Data Fabric allows seamless movement of data between different storage environments, removing the gravity of data and making it possible to bi-directionally move data between on-premises data centres and multiple clouds. To be truly smart, smart cities need a smart, sophisticated infrastructure that makes data easy to manage and use as an insightful asset. Furthermore, as smart cities scale, all-Flash data centres will provide a solution that befits the data and performance-intensive nature of a smart city, while protecting against ungainly footprint and power usage needs.

COMMENT Make sure you get your PC purchase right by considering your IT needs Ben Lobel Making a PC purchase can be a confusing process for a small business owner, who have to contend with a long list of specifications, brands, and prices, not to mention differing online reviews. Here, Dell has put together the top tips for SMEs looking to update their technology. 1. Define the role and select the right solution set for the job As a small business, you have created roles within your organisation. You should define and understand the work required of each role. This will enable you to select the most appropriate ecosystem for optimal employee productivity. Knowing how employees will use their PCs determines whether performance, mobility, battery life or display quality is most important. A desk-bound engineer designing a next generation product will require more computing power than a traveling salesperson. Based on role-specific priorities, you will choose from a wide variety of devices, including notebooks, desktops, 2-in-1s or tablets. The same process applies when choosing a processor – PCs containing entry-level processors will perform just fine for general office duties such as responding to emails, drafting documents and generating presentations. As the performance demands increase, so does the need for a higher-end PC purchase containing more advanced components. Employees who use complex software programs such as graphic design, video editing and other compute-intensive applications will require higher end processors and graphics cards to ensure smooth performance. Upgrading to PCs containing sixth Gen Intel® Core™ processors will enable faster performance, lower energy consumption, 4k video editing and immersive graphics. 2. Keep docks and monitors in mind Because modularity is becoming a crucial factor in the evolution of the workplace, you should consider the need for versatile and powerful docking systems. This can be especially important within small businesses, where resources are tight and IT equipment might be slim. The flexibility of docking systems allows employees to adapt to ever-changing working scenarios by being mobile one day and desk-centric the next. A notebook combined with a dock that instantly connects to a monitor, keyboard and mouse will enhance productivity. 3. Provide options for user types based on device Today, thin and light notebooks and 2-in-1s make being mobile and getting work done even easier. To realise the business benefits of a mobility strategy, small businesses should understand the work different employees are doing, where they are doing it and identify the best combination of devices to meet their needs. Needs vary based on the type of business, but most organisations prioritise PCs and smartphones as the two most critical tools for empowering a productive workforce. 4. Take advantage of all that Windows 10 has to offer PCs based on Windows 10 provide significant feature advancements and enable small businesses to easily manage and secure devices and data in a mobile-first, cloud-connected world. Windows 10 runs on all device types, works beautifully with Office 365 and automatically stores files in the cloud so co-workers can collaborate on documents wherever and whenever. Windows 10 fosters a cohesive ecosystem that allows employees to use just one sign-in across Windows and Office, so when they log in to any Windows 10 Pro device (tablet, phone, or laptop), they will have access to all of their current files, data, apps and personal settings. The latest generation of Windows 10-enabled PCs offer a slew of new features including touch, pen, fingerprint security and advanced 2-in-1 capabilities that allow the device to seamlessly transition from a notebook to a tablet and back again. The addition of Windows 10 universal apps allows software programs to run on any device to enable greater portability and more productivity at work. Universal apps reduce the cost of developing individual line of business (LOB) apps because they can be deployed across PCs, tablets, phones and IoT devices. 5. Prioritise security for your PC purchase As a small business, security is a crucial element of your IT ecosystem. Windows 10 Pro delivers enterprise-grade security for organisations of all sizes and offers compelling tools to take advantage of the latest hardware innovation to combat cyber threats. If a Windows 10 Pro device or USB drive is lost or stolen, BitLocker and BitLocker-to-Go put everything on lockdown so no one else can access systems or data. You can enable additional protection to do multiple tasks, such as remotely delete business data from lost, stolen, or former employees’ personal devices without touching their personal information. For another layer of security, strategic partners such as Dell offer data protection packages that encrypt each individual file so all information is protected no matter where it goes. In a small business, top-notch security can go a long way in saving unwanted costs and compliance fees down the line. 6. Understand the importance of manageability Your business may be small today, but if growth is on the horizon, you may find yourself managing 50, 100 or even 1000 employees. Manually updating a few PCs may seem like a manageable task while your business is small, but will be a headache if it comes to manually updating hundreds of disparate devices. By choosing a Windows infrastructure for your business, you will enjoy the simplicity of keeping your devices up to date thanks to new Windows as a Service automatic updates and the ability to manage all devices remotely. Keeping manageability in mind early on will help you scale with ease. 7. Recognise the benefits of good service As a small business, you may not have the luxury of your own IT department. This creates convenience, logistical, and potentially critical challenges due to lack of immediate in-person support. The importance of having reliable external service is crucial when it comes to deploying, managing and tending to workplace technology. When making a PC purchase and building a PC infrastructure, consider the service capabilities offered by their IT provider – alongside cost, offerings, reliability and reputation. 8. Choose a reliable partner Choosing a reliable technology partner is a critical moment for a small business. Try to connect with organisations in the same or similar vertical/niche. This will allow you to learn from what they have found to be successful and enable you to make smarter PC purchase decisions. Seeing how relevant companies deal with IT concerns, budget issues, and everyday challenges can drive your own decision-making and, ultimately, your success. 9. Unlock productivity through both hardware and software You can maximise employee productivity through enhancements to the user experience, such as the addition of backlit keyboards, touch screens or 10 finger touch panels. These product features enable new, immersive ways for workers to interact with technology and can help them create and present in imaginative ways. When it comes to software, Windows 10 is designed to support productivity with new Microsoft apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote optimised for the new OS. In addition to Microsoft-developed applications, there is a broad range of apps on the Windows Store designed to improve productivity inside and outside the office, including Evernote, RemindMe, Trello, Splashtop Business and Poki to name a few.

The deal is the largest in the history of the semiconductor industry. According to a statement Thursday, Qualcomm has agreed to pay $110 a share for NXP, an 11% premium over NXP's closing price on Wednesday. Qualcomm is the largest maker of smartphone chips, while NXP serves the auto industry. The companies aim to form a behemoth that leads in the growing market for car infotainment systems and internet-of-things devices while remaining a major supplier of mobile-phone chips. The combined company expects to have annual revenue of more than $30 billion and service a market the companies project will be worth $138 billion in 2020. By combining resources, they estimate annualized cost-saving synergies of $500 million within two years of the deal closing. Goldman Sachs and Evercore were financial advisers to Qualcomm. Qualcomm said it would finance the deal with a combination of cash on hand and new debt. With JPMorgan, Goldman is providing debt financing for the transaction. Qatalyst Partners was NXP's lead financial adviser. The acquisition is part of a frenzy of multibillion-dollar deals in the tech industry over the past 20 months, including Intel's takeover of Altera, Avago's acquisition of Broadcom, and Dell's $67 billion takeover of EMC. Here's the full statement: Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM) and NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NASDAQ: NXPI) today announced a definitive agreement, unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies, under which Qualcomm will acquire NXP. Pursuant to the agreement, a subsidiary of Qualcomm will commence a tender offer to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of NXP for $110.00 per share in cash, representing a total enterprise value of approximately $47 billion. NXP is a leader in high-performance, mixed-signal semiconductor electronics, with innovative products and solutions and leadership positions in automotive, broad-based microcontrollers, secure identification, network processing and RF power. As a leading semiconductor solutions supplier to the automotive industry, NXP also has leading positions in automotive infotainment, networking and safety systems, with solutions designed into 14 of the top 15 infotainment customers in 2016.

Qualcomm expects to generate $500 million of annualized run-rate cost synergies within two years after the transaction closes. The transaction utilizes Qualcomm's strong balance sheet and will be efficiently financed with offshore cash and new debt. The transaction structure allows tax efficient use of offshore cash flow and enables Qualcomm to reduce leverage rapidly. Mollenkopf continued, "We have taken significant action to build a foundation for profitable growth and the acquisition of NXP is strongly aligned with our strategy. Our companies both have substantial expertise in delivering industry-leading solutions to our global customers, built upon a shared commitment to technology innovation, focused R&D investments and strong financial and operational discipline."

"United in a common strategy, the complementary nature of our technologies and the scale of our portfolios will give us the ability to drive an accelerated level of innovation and value for the whole ecosystem. Such a strong fit will bring opportunities for our employees and customers, as well as provide immediate attractive value for our shareholders, in creating the semiconductor industry powerhouse." Sir Peter Bonfield, Chairman of NXP's Board of Directors, said, "This is a major step in my ten years' Chairmanship of NXP, and I am very pleased to see that the board of NXP has unanimously approved the proposed transaction and fully supports and recommends the offer for acceptance to NXP shareholders."

Qualcomm intends to fund the transaction with cash on hand and new debt. The transaction is structured to enable tax efficient use of offshore cash flow to rapidly reduce leverage. Qualcomm is committed to maintaining its strong investment-grade credit ratings. The solid combined cash flow profile will support Qualcomm's current dividend and dividend growth. Qualcomm is committed to anti-dilutive repurchases of its common stock as it de-levers its balance sheet to pre-transaction leverage levels. The pro forma cash flow profile provides a strong foundation for long-term capital returns to stockholders. The tender offer is not subject to any financing condition.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Hayley Tsukayama October 27 Follow @htsuka Apple revealed their new MacBook Pro at an event Oct. 27. Take a look. (Apple) CUPERTINO, Calif. -- Apple unveiled a redesigned MacBook Pro, which incorporates smartphone-like touch screen features right into the keyboard and carries a higher price tag of $1,800. Apple has been furiously updating its smartphones every year, but it has been years since customers saw much more than basic refreshes of the company's highest-end laptop. At its event here, Apple spent considerable time showing off its newest innovation for its new MacBook Pro. The company called it the "touch bar," which replaces the long-standing function keys at the top of the keyboard with a small touch-screen strip. The touch bar changes depending on the program that is running on the computer. It offers quick typing suggestions in a word processor, emojis in a texting program, or volume and play buttons in a music program. It also offers "touch id", enabling a user to unlock the computer with a fingerprint. The 13-inch MacPro Pro without the touch bar costs $1,500. The new feature brings that price up to $1,800. The 15-inch screen starts at $2,000. Previously the MacBook Pro line started at $1,300. The rising price of Apple's notebooks is unusual in the consumer electronics world where products such as big-screen TVs and computers become cheaper over time. But Apple has been making a bid to become an upscale retailer, something some analysts long ago thought was difficult to do in mass-produced hardware computers. "The price points for the new MacBook Pro models sit in a rarified stratum of the PC market," J.P. Gownder, a technology analyst at Forrester, said Thursday. Laptops and tablets designed by Microsoft, he added, "have eaten away at Apple's lead among both high end buyers and creators, so Apple had to fight back.... but Apple's deep brand loyalty will make the products successful among the target audience anyway." EPA/TONY AVELAR Price also appears to be the way that Apple is distinguishing its somewhat confusing lineup of laptops. The new 13-inch MacBook Pro is actually thinner and weighs the same as Apple's 13-inch MacBook Air, which was originally intended to be the company's ultra-light laptop. The MacBook Air is priced at $1,000 and is Apple's cheapest notebook. Beyond these computers, Apple also offers its traditional MacBooks at various screen sizes, starting at $1300. Apple said its new MacBook Pro had a 67 percent brighter screen, a faster processor, and was lighter -- 4 pounds for the 15-inch notebook, which Phil Schiller, Apple senior vice president of worldwide marketing, said was "almost unheard of" for a high-performance professional notebook. The laptops could be ordered online starting Thursday. Apple did not update its iPads or desktop Macs. In August, Bloomberg reported that Apple was working on new iMacs and a new high-end "Thunderbolt" display, but fairly reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities says that these are unlikely to come out until 2017. The Apple event comes just a day after Microsoft introduced two new expensive computers — the Surface Book laptop and the Surface Studio desktop. Microsoft took aim at its old rival, Apple, by noting that the Surface Book was three times faster than Apple's best 13-inch MacBook Pro. Thursday, Apple had its chance to hit back with a few jabs of its own. Apple kicked off its announcements with a somewhat unexpected subject: Apple TV. The company did not announce a new version of its set-top box, but it announced some new apps that could make the device more appealing to consumers. Apple chief executive Tim Cook said that Minecraft, the popular building game owned by Microsoft, will hit Apple TV by the end of the year. Twitter's Ryan Troy, the company's global lead for TV devices, also took to the stage to show off the new Apple TV Twitter app, which is being held up as a prime example of interactive viewing apps. Apple is trying to simplify the Apple TV for users — a key move as more cord-cutting services flood users with more options than they may actually be willing to sift through. With a new Apple TV app simply called “TV,” the company is aggregating users' many streaming options into one spot, making it easier to search and surface content. It looks somewhat like iTunes, but with television content. And, of course, it works with Siri for search. The app will look the same across Apple TV, iPhone and iPad and will be part of a free update in December.
