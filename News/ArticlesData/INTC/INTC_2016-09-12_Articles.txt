Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Sep 13, 2016 at 3:33PM Image source: Intel.  In a previous column, I wrote about an interesting job listing that I found on Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) website. In particular, it seemed to suggest that products based on the company's upcoming 7-nanometer manufacturing technology might not arrive until either 2021 or 2022. I recently stumbled across something, hidden in plain view, that seems to corroborate this idea. Let's take a closer look. Check out this slide from Intel's developer forum At Intel's recent developer forum, two executives gave a presentation disclosing some key details about recently announced and future chip manufacturing technologies, as well as the company's strategy to provide contract chip manufacturing services to third parties. In one slide, Intel showed how it intended to offer three different iterations of its 10-nanometer technology known as 10-nanometer, 10-nanometer+, and 10-nanometer++. Each successive iteration is expected to deliver better performance "to support multiple leading-edge products." Looking more closely at the slide reveals something interesting: Image source: Intel. Notice that the circle denoting the third iteration of the company's 10-nanometer manufacturing technology, known as 10-nanometer++, actually sits solidly beyond the 2020 time-frame. This could mean one of two things If Intel really isn't planning to get its 10-nanometer++ technology out there until sometime past 2020, then this could mean one of two things. The first, and certainly the more pessimistic, implication is that the company's 7-nanometer technology won't arrive until well beyond 2020. Indeed, if 10-nanometer++ is expected to arrive in 2021 or even 2022, we could be looking at late 2022 or early 2023 before the chipmaker transitions to its 7-nanometer technology. Such a significant delay, particularly in light of the fact that contract chip manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) plans to put its 5-nanometer technology into production in 2020, would mean that Intel will fall behind its biggest competitor in terms of chip area scaling. (TSMC's 5-nanomater technology is likely to be similar in terms of transistor density to Intel's 7-nanometer technology.) An alternative explanation is that Intel actually intends 10-nanometer++ and 7-nanometer to co-exist. For applications that absolutely need to be on the latest, densest manufacturing technology, Intel could design products on the newer, and potentially more expensive, 7-nanometer technology. For products that don't need to adopt bleeding-edge manufacturing technologies -- for example, desktop processors -- 10-nanometer++ could be a better, more cost-effective choice. In fact, we are already going to see something similar to this next year. Intel's next-generation desktop processors, code-named Coffee Lake, are expected to be manufactured on the company's 14-nanometer technology, while the low-power notebook and 2-in-1 processors, code-named Cannon Lake, that are expected to arrive at the same time will be built on the company's newer 10-nanometer technology. Some additional clarity needed At Intel's investor meeting later this year, I expect the company to go into more depth on its chip manufacturing strategy and how it views the competitive landscape. It will be interesting to see if the company talks at all about the potential timing of its 7-nanometer and potentially even its future 5-nanometer technologies. I'm not going to hold my breath for such disclosures, although given how aggressively the competition is advertising its technology plans, they would be most welcome.

Food is the backbone of our island and it only takes one visit to understand why. From hot sugar-dusted malasadas to shave ice, poke (before it was trendy), and hearty bowls of saimin, the food in Hawaii is a melting pot of cultures. At the beach, in food courts, or even at the corner grocery, finding a high quality and affordable meal is easy. Below is a collection of iconic cheap eats, the local foods that are fresh and fast, accessible, and delicious. Most importantly, they are all unique to the island. Whether you're a first-time visitor or a local, consider this list a starter guide to the most essential street foods and easy-to-find bites Honolulu has to offer. Poke Bowls Poke bowls are all the rage now, but we've been eating chopped and marinated fish over rice for decades here in Hawaii. Most of the new places on the mainland make poke to order, or fancy it up. But "real" poke is pre-made (very important because you want the fish to soak in all the sauce/marinade) and usually sold by the pound. Where to get it: Ahi Assasins 2570 S Beretania St., Honolulu; website. Vital Intel: The owners catch the fish daily, and the poke is simple, good, and fresh. It's also super affordable (available by the pound or $7 for a bowl). What more can you ask for? If you're only having one poke bowl in Honolulu, do it here. Foodland Multiple locations; website. Vital Intel: Foodland is a supermarket with many locations throughout the state. They have a quality poke bar where you can purchase by the pound or order bowls to go. Don't be shy about asking for a taste before deciding on a flavor. Hawaiian Plate Not to be confused with plate lunch (more on that below), Hawaiian plate consists of many components — too many to break down where to find the best individually. Where to begin? First there must be rice, poi, mac salad, and chicken long rice. Add on from there. Lau lau and tripe stew. Lomi salmon and luau squid. And of course, haupia for dessert (haupia is a Hawaiian sweet that’s a cross between coconut milk pudding and jelly, see chocolate-haupia below). Head to one of these places below and order lots to share (or one of the set combos if dining solo). Where to get it: Helena's Hawaiian Food 1240 N School St., Honolulu; website. Vital intel: This is heaven for Hawaiian food. You'll want (and should get) everything. Chicken long rice, mac salad, luau squid... it's all dreamy. The pipikaula (short ribs) is also out of this world. Go early — unless you want to wait in line and/or go crazy trying to find a parking spot — and bring cash. Highway Inn Kaka'ako 680 Ala Moana Blvd. #105, Honolulu; website. Vital intel: A more approachable but still delicious and authentic spot for Hawaiian food cravings. On Thursdays, you can get fresh kulolo (a traditional grated taro and coconut milk dessert) flown in from Kauai. Shave Ice Super-fine ice shaved into a bowl and finished with syrup: While there are similar versions around the world (like snow cones, halo-halo, kakigori, etc), the ones in Hawaii are in a league of their own. Biased? Perhaps. But the ice here is fluffy, light, and literally melt-in-your-mouth perfect. Couple that with natural syrups (often made from local fruits) and toppings (like azuki beans, ice cream, and fresh mochi balls) and you'll see why. Where to get it: The Local 137 Hekili St. #108, Kailua; website. Vital Intel: All-natural flavors and a super delicate shave makes the Local worth the drive to Kailua. Keep an eye out for the seasonal syrups (like pickled mango and guava). You can put up to three flavors in an order. Your Kitchen 1423 10th Ave., Honolulu Vital Intel: The "tropical bowl" is the thing to order here. It's a giant portion of half-mango and half-haupia shave ice topped with housemade haupia ice cream (one of the best in town). Spam Musubi The thing about Spam musubi is that there is no right or wrong way about it as long as you have the three essentials: rice, Spam, and nori. There are a million variations. Some like Spam sliced straight from the can, others like it pan-fried in shoyu until extra crispy. Thick slice, thin slice. Spam on top, Spam in the middle. More rice, less rice. Some places even layer in an egg (or top it with a quail egg). You can get Spam musubi everywhere from 7-11 (a very popular spot for musubis) to fine-dining restaurants. Where to get it: Fort Ruger Market 3585 Alohea Ave., Honolulu, HI 96816; website. Vital Intel: Find classic Spam musubi plus a ton of other variations at this convenience store/plate lunch spot/musubi stop. Look out for musubis with mochiko chicken, Portuguese sausage, plus bacon-and-egg and shoyu hot dogs. Musubi Cafe Iyasume 2427 Kuhio Ave., Honolulu; website. Vital Intel: This tiny shop is devoted to  musubi. You can get Spam musubis plain or paired with anything from cheese to shiso or ume, and even topped with avocado, egg, and/or bacon. They do a nice job with the rice here. Mochi Mochi, a sweet rice cake with Japanese origins, is casual snack in Hawaii. You’ll find it at the office potluck gathering, at a friend’s house on any given afternoon, and if you’re lucky, in the car when your parents pick you up from the airport. Hawaii's mochi is less formal than traditional Japanese mochi. Texturally, it’s softer, and less delicate. It’s often sold by the pound or in box sets. Classic flavors like azuki bean are popular, but there are no hard rules; locals happily embrace mochi in flavors from peanut butter to blueberry cheesecake and chocolate-haupia. Where to get it: Nisshodo Candy Store 1095 Dillingham Blvd., Honolulu; website. Vital Intel: Order the chichi dango (plain, rectangular cuts of mochi made from mochiko flour). These are sold by the pound and not to be missed: Order half-plain and half-dusted in kinako (roasted soybean powder). Nisshodo also makes manju from wheat flour — it's like a soft cookie shell stuffed with a sweet bean filling, and some places steam it, Nisshodo offers a baked version. It's available in many traditional (like white bean and red bean) and modern flavors (like peanut butter). Saturday Grandma’s Mochi at Made in Hawaii Foods 2071 S Beretania St., Honolulu; website. Vital Intel: Saturday Grandma's Mochi sells out early at the Farmer's Market each weekend. The best way to avoid the crowd is to stop by their brick-and-mortar on South Beretania (which no one seems to know about) or pre-order by phone for pick-up. Don't miss the lilikoi (passionfruit) cheesecake mochi. Happy Hearts Mochi Order online for pickup at Natsunoya Tea House, 1935 Makanani Dr., Honolulu; website. Vital Intel: Bento #4, pictured above, is the way to go: one each of all the classic plus fresh strawberry mochi (a whole strawberry wrapped in azuki bean paste and mochi). The haupia-stuffed mochi (which comes in plain, chocolate, and hazelnut-coffee flavors) is heaven. Malasadas Imagine a hot yeast doughnut meets brioche, but a little eggier; fried to a deep, dark brown; and then rolled in sugar. That’s a malasada. The roots are Portuguese, but like many things that come here, it’s become Hawaiian-izied over the years. Malasadas are a very personal thing; for each person that prefers Leonard’s, there’s another that sticks by Champion’s. Where to get it: Punahou Carnival 1601 Punahou St., Honolulu; website. Vital Intel: The best malasadas on the island (they say the secret is a tiny bit of nutmeg and cinnamon mixed into the sugar) are only available the first weekend of every February, when the Punahou school hosts its annual carnival. It's worth planning a trip around. Leonard's Bakery 933 Kapahulu Ave., Honolulu; website. Vital Intel: A Honolulu institution loved by locals and tourists, Leonard's makes malasadas in a range of flavors. Get them dusted in cinnamon-sugar or li hing mui sugar (li hing mui is a salty dried plum powder that gets paired with everything from fresh fruit to cocktails in Hawaii), and stuffed with custard, dobash (chocolate pudding), or haupia. Only getting one? Make it the sugar-dusted classic. Champion Malasadas 1926 S Beretania St., Honolulu; website. Vital intel: Champion's is less crowded and chaotic than Leonard's. Because there's less foot traffic, every malasada is fried to order — and nothing beats a freshly fried malasada. (While you're here, pick up one of its signature mini chiffon cakes for snacking later.) Sashimi Sashimi on the mainland tends to be a special, sushi night treat. But in Hawaii, we eat a ton of fresh fish, and sashimi often shows up at a casual dinner or takeout lunch. Whether simply sliced and piled over rice so that you can take it to go, or sold by the large plate/pound, you can always count on finding high quality sashimi for fair prices. It's one of the best parts about eating in Hawaii. Where to get it: Kyung's Seafood 1269 S King St., Honolulu; website. Vital Intel: A centrally-located hole-in-the-wall frequented by chefs and locals in the know. Come with friends and get the large sashimi platter to share. Order up a few hot dishes, strawberry soju slush (for real), and call it a night. They also make great poke (especially the salmon-ahi mix). Maguro Brothers Hawaii 1039 Kekaulike St. #113, Honolulu; website. Vital Intel: Located inside a Chinatown seafood and vegetable market, this tiny spot is primarily takeout, but they have a few seats. Order big, beautiful sashimi platters to-go or, for lunch, you can get sashimi donburi bowls (served over rice). The daily offerings include maguro, chu-toro, and king salmon. Definitely add a side of ikura and/or uni. Plate Lunch Plate lunch is a broad term and there are many way to interpret it. To simplify, there’s rice, macaroni salad (though opting to sub in green salad is getting trendy), and meat (mochicko chicken, garlic shrimp, hamburger steak, etc.). It’s a complete meal served in a plastic or styrofoam container or paper plate. Not fancy, super delicious. You’ll hear it used in context like: "What’d you have for lunch?" followed by "Got a plate lunch from Rainbow’s today"; "Will you order me the mochiko chicken plate lunch from Diamond Head Grill?"; "Let’s get Korean plate lunch for dinner" (see photo). Like Spam musubi, there is no "correct" way to create a plate lunch. There is just a lot of variety, all boiling down to personal preference. Where to get it: Rainbow Drive-In 3308 Kanaina Ave., Honolulu; website. Vital Intel: Rainbow's is the classic. The "Mix Plate" gives you a taste of the most popular dishes, though the chili dog plate is also great. Don't forget the slush float for dessert. Romy's Kahuku Prawns & Shrimp 56-781 Kamehameha Highway, Kahuku; website. Vital Intel: The butter garlic shrimp plate and li hing mui pineapples (for pre-lunch snack or dessert) are musts. There's always a wait (usually 45 minutes) so phone in your order early or wait it out at Kahuku Farms across the street, where you can devour a grilled banana bread ice cream sundae. Gina's B-B-Q Market City Shopping Center, 2919 Kapiolani Blvd., Honolulu; website. Vital Intel: Everything about this place is wonderful. Go here for Korean plate lunch, order the Gina's Special, and share it with a friend — it's gigantic. Gina's also makes super japchae and potato salad, and her kalbi and barbecue chicken are outstanding. Coco Puffs These are a Hawaii classic and they come from one bakery: Liliha Bakery. A Coco Puff is composed of three parts: choux pastry, chocolate pudding, and chantilly. It's the size of a golf ball and served chilled. The pastry is stuffed with the pudding — super thick and not too chocolate-y — then crowned with chantilly. Chantilly usually refers to whipped cream, but in Hawaii chantilly is a frosting made from lots of egg yolks, sugar, and butter. FYI, you'll also spot green tea Coco Puffs at the bakery, but don't be tempted. They're not nearly as good as the original chocolate. Where to get it: Liliha Bakery 515 N Kuakini St, Honolulu; website. Vital intel: The original and the best. Liliha Bakery sells between 4,800 to 7,200 Coco Puffs daily. They make many other baked goods — and it's also a restaurant — so if you have room for more, get the pancake/waffle batter, dobash cake, and butter rolls (dine-in and they'll split, butter, and grill the rolls on a flat top). Manapua A manapua is essentially a giant char siu bao, a steamed bun filled with fatty roast pork. One is a snack, two is a meal. Some places offer steamed manapuas, and other do baked. Char siu is the classic filling, though nowadays you’ll find everything from curried manapua to sweet ones filled with black sesame and sweet potato. Where to get it: Chun Wah Kam Multiple locations; website. Vital Intel: Here manapua is offered in a variety of flavors including thai curry chicken, kalua pig, and honey garlic chicken. There's even mini manapuas. Char Hung Sut 64 N Pauahi St., Honolulu. Vital Intel: Come to this old-school Chinatown classic for the steamed char siu manapua. Chocolate-Haupia Chocolate-haupia is not a specific dessert but a flavor combination that is popular in Hawaii. There’s chocolate-haupia mochi (as mentioned in the mochi section), there’s chocolate-haupia pies, and chocolate-haupia layered on shortbread. These two flavors go together perfectly and you’ll see them in many dessert offerings across the island. Where to get it: Ted’s Bakery 59-024 Kamehameha Highway, Haleiwa; website. Vital Intel: Home of the famous Cchocolate-haupia pie. The original location of Ted’s is on the North Shore (a must visit for any island road trip), but you can also find their pies at supermarkets across the island. It’s super simple: pie crust filled with a bottom layer of chocolate pudding, a top layer of haupia, and topped with whipped cream. Ted’s also makes chocolate-haupia cake — try both and compare. Via Gelato 1142 12th Ave., Kaimuki; website. Vital Intel: Get a cone with half-chocolate and half-haupia. Yama's Fish Market 2332 Young St., Honolulu; website. Vital intel: This is also a great spot to pick up a Hawaiian plate lunch, but make sure to look for the refrigerated case to the right when you enter. That's where you'll find the chocolate-haupia brownie. Saimin In the same way that Hawaii is a literal melting pot of cultures, saimin is a melting pot of noodle soup. It’s a bit like Japanese ramen, a bit like Chinese wonton mein, and a bit like Filipino pancit noodles. This is comfort food: Clear, hot broth, saimin noodles, and toppings that most commonly include green onions, char siu and/or Spam, and kamaboko (fish cake). Where to get it: Palace Saimin 1256 N King St., Honolulu; website. Vital Intel: Pay particular attention to the broth — they use both pork and shrimp. Add an order of barbecue sticks (bite-size pieces of beef skewered onto a stick, marinated in a sauce akin to teriyaki, and broiled) to make a complete meal. Palace also offers saidon, which is saimin and udon mixed in the same bowl. Jane's Fountain 1719 Liliha St., Honolulu. Vital Intel: Come the nostalgic decor, stay for the saimin. Wonton mein (which is saimin with pork and/or shrimp dumplings) plus a barbecue stick is the go-to order here. Kathy YL Chan splits her time between her native Hawaii and NYC.

Credit: Intel More like this Raspberry Pi 3 gets the Windows 10 anniversary update Intel's new Atom chips bring 4K video to VR headsets, robots Raspberry Pi 3 creator hopes for Windows 10 desktop OS support Video How the Apple Watch copies Samsung and why you need to be scared Microsoft is challenging Linux's domination in Raspberry Pi-type computers by bringing support for Windows 10 OS to more developer boards. The newest computer to get a version of Windows 10 will be Intel's Joule, which has cutting-edge hardware compared to Raspberry Pi 3. To be specific, Joule will get support for Windows 10 IoT Core -- a slimmed-down version of Windows 10 -- by year-end, Microsoft said in a blog post last week. Joule currently supports only the Linux OS. With Windows 10 IoT Core, Joule can be used to develop gadgets, robots, drones, wearables, medical devices and smart industrial devices. The OS is supported by four other mini-computers -- Raspberry Pi 2 and 3, Qualcomm's DragonBoard 410c and Intel's MinnowMax. Microsoft is tapping into the community of enthusiasts developing new devices to push into the internet of things market. Expanding Windows 10 IoT Core support to more boards will give the company wider access to makers. Raspberry Pi may be the most the popular board computer, but Intel's Joule is perhaps the most complete, with superior hardware and wide OS support. It has a 64-bit Atom processor, 4K graphics, DDR4 memory and 802.11ac connectivity. But at $369.99, it is much more expensive than the $35 Raspberry Pi 3. Microsoft's Windows operating systems have worked well with Intel x86 processors, but most IoT devices are based on ARM processors, which power Raspberry Pi 3. The Windows OS is available for free for developer boards. Windows 10 IoT Core will give Joule users access to Azure cloud, which helps tack on services to gadgets. Microsoft recently delivered the Anniversary Update for Windows 10 IoT Core. It has a new feature called Windows IoT Remote Client so boards like Joule can be remotely accessed by smartphones and PCs. The update also has better communication tools. An adapter called IoTivity AllJoyn Device System Bridge allows devices based on two separate standards to communicate -- the Intel-backed Open Interconnect Consortium (OIC) and Microsoft-backed AllSeen Alliance. The discovery and security specifications from both organizations will be merged into new protocols of the Open Connectivity Foundation, which will have native Windows 10 support next year. The Joule board was introduced by Intel last month and will come in multiple versions. The Joule 570x has a 1.7GHz Atom T5700 processor, 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM and 16GB of storage. Intel will later release Joule 550x, which will have a 1.5GHz Atom T5500 CPU, 3GB of LPDDR4 memory and 8GB of storage. The Joule 570x has expansion ports regularly found on developer boards and interfaces to attach Intel's 3D RealSense camera.

Klint Finley Business Date of Publication: 09.13.16. 09.13.16 Time of Publication: 12:28 pm. 12:28 pm Hardware Giants Hope the Past Can Save Their Future Getty Images HP. Dell. EMC. Intel. The giants of computer hardware aren’t what they were ten years ago. Heck, they’re aren’t even what they were five years ago—or, for that matter, just a few months ago. These hardware giants realize that the technology landscape is shifting. With the rise of smartphones and tablets, PCs are far less important. With the rise of cloud computing services from Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and others, many businesses can build websites and other software without buying hardware for the data center. And when they do need hardware, they’re looking for something different, thanks again to the influence of the biggest Internet companies, including Facebook as well as the big cloud computing vendors. But although HP, Dell, EMC, and Intel see the shifts, they aren’t always sure how to deal with them. As the landscape around them continues to morph, they continue to reorganize, reshape, and remake themselves in an effort to keep pace. Sometimes, they acquire companies in entirely new markets. And sometimes, they jettison these acquisitions as they bet on entirely news ones. The only thing that’s constant in the hardware business is change. For a while there, these hardware giants thought the best thing to do was transform themselves into software companies. In 2010, Intel, the world’s largest computer chip maker, spent $7.68 billion acquiring security software company McAfee. A year later, PC and server giant HP spent $11.1 billion on “big data” company Autonomy. And over the next few years, another PC and server giant, Dell, spent billions on all kinds of software companies. But none of that really worked. Dell shed its software companies earlier this summer, and last week, HP Enterprise bid farewell to Autonomy, selling its software division to Micro Focus. Oh, and that same week, Intel spun off McAfee. Dell and HP also thought they could be cloud companies. But that didn’t work either. So now they’re reorganizing themselves again. HP split in two, and this week, one half bought the printer division of Samsung. Dell merged with EMC. Meanwhile, Intel is buying up various companies that make very different kinds of chips. After failing with software, these hardware companies ares going back to being, well, hardware companies. In short, the struggling to find where they fit into the future of technology—if they fit anywhere at all. Intel certainly does. But we’re not sure about the rest. The Shopping Spree Some companies can transform themselves as the market shifts. A decade and a half ago, IBM turned itself into something different. In 2002, it acquired the IT consulting company PricewaterhouseCoopers, and three years later, it sold off its personal computer business. In the years to come, it would focus on hardware, software, and consulting services for big businesses, and it worked. While PCs had become commodities—and it was clear the market was on the wane—enterprise IT was a lucrative, high-margin business. As the market continued to shift away from PCs and towards phones and tablets, other computer giants tried something similar. Dell went on a shopping spree that included database software maker Quest, network security company SonicWall, and cloud management company Enstratius. Intel snapped up McAfee. And the HP took the most radical approach—or at least it tried to. In 2011, then HP CEO Leo Apotheker announced the Autonomy acquisition, and word spread that the company would sell off its PC division. But Apotheker was fired a month later, and the company tabled plans to spin-off the PC division. Investors get spooked when you try to completely reinvent a major company overnight. But it needed reinvention. And the urgency only increased. By the beginning of this decade, cloud computing was changing enterprise IT, and all these companies needed to change again. Intel did so quite successfully, becoming the main supplier of chips to the Internet’s biggest players, including Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Facebook. It powered the cloud. But those big Internet players put these Intel chips into new kinds of servers and data storage devices, turning away from HP, Dell, and storage giant EMC. HP eventually split into two companies in order to focus its strengths—HP Enterprise (business hardware and software) and HP Inc. (PCs and printers)—but it had missed the boat. Amazon was dominating the cloud, and Google and Microsoft were well ahead of anyone else. Microsoft has ably reinvented itself for the modern age, and though both still face many obstacles, they’re better off than HP and Dell. HP didn’t just miss the boat. It paid a ridiculous amount for for the wrong boat, Autonomy. Finding a New Direction What Dell, EMC, HP and Intel have learned in recent years is that it isn’t easy for a hardware company to become a software company. But we can cut them a little slack here. After all, others have made similar mistakes. Google and Microsoft have learned that it isn’t easy for a software company to become a hardware company. In recent years, Google phone acquired maker Motorola Mobility before promptly selling it to Lenovo. Microsoft is writing down its purchase of phone maker Nokia. The bigger issue is that Dell, EMC, HP, and Intel didn’t see where the future was going. Instead of buying McAfee, Intel should be pushed harder into mobile phones. Instead of buying Autonomy, HP should have gotten far more serious about the cloud. Ah, but Intel certainly sees the next wave: artificial intelligence. The same week it spun-off McAfee, it bought Movidius, a company that specializes in making AI chips for drones, smartphones, and other gadgets. With this buy, Intel has a chance of finding a real foothold in the mobile business. Last month, it also bought a company called Nervena, which makes AI chips for servers. And last year, it dropped $16.7 billion on Altera, whose chips can also help with AI. These acquisitions also make sense because they’re closer to Intel’s core business. The chip maker is buying other chip makers. But that alone doesn’t breed success. After all, HP is doubling down on printers. But that is hardly the future. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

Technavio defines an emerging trend as a factor that has the potential to significantly impact the market and contribute to its growth or decline. The global RAID controller card market mark the presence of many reputed vendors such as Avago Technologies (Broadcom), Intel, Fujitsu,Dell, and HP. Avago Technologies dominates the market due to its acquisition of LSI Technologies in 2014. With big names like Intel, Fujitsu, Dell, and HP, continuous innovation is required to become the leader in the market. In 2016, Broadcom introduced the first NVMe/SATA/SAS-based controllers. As there is a growing popularity of flash-based storage technologies, this introduction by the company will help it lead the global RAID controller card market. Request a sample report: http://www.technavio.com/request-a-sample?report=52439 Technavio's sample reports are free of charge and contain multiple sections of the report including the market size and forecast, drivers, challenges, trends, and more. The top three emerging trends driving the global RAID controller card market according to Technavio hardware and semiconductor research analysts are: Increasing popularity of flash-based storage Increased adoption of IoT Emergence of containerized data centers Increasing popularity of flash-based storage Solid state drive (SSD) storage or flash storage offers greater efficiency than traditional HDD storage devices. In 2015, the cost of flash-based storage was greater than that of HDD-based storage arrays. Vendors are continuously decreasing their product prices due to the increased demand for storage infrastructure in the market. With the increased use of mission-critical applications, flash-based storage arrays offer 40 times better than hard disk input/output (I/O) performance and around 50% reduction in power consumption. Sunil Kumar Singh, a lead analyst at Technavio for research on embeddedsystems, says, "Due to the higher cost involved in procuring flash-based storage systems, it will experience a higher growth in large and mega data centers. However, the price of these systems will drop by 5%-10% YoY, resulting in an increased demand for flash storage during the period 2018-2020. The overall market will experience a steady growth in the adoption of flash and traditional storage systems, where flash will add more revenue in the coming years." Increased adoption of IoT Technavio researchers predict there will be around 30 billion internet-connected devices by 2019. This will give a major boost to the global data center market. The use of RFID sensors in logistics and warehouses in the late 1990s had put the focus on IoT. RFID is used to tag, track, connect, and read objects. The growing number of connected devices will lead to the generation of big chunks of data. Connected cars, homes, and smart cities are gaining popularity. As a result, many industries such as manufacturing, utilities, retail, automotive, and social media are using IoT for increased data transfer. By 2019, IoT-enabled devices will increase the data center traffic by 40 times. Cloud computing and data analytics play a major role in connected reality. Data centers are constantly upgraded to meet IoT data storage and processing requirements. "Many businesses are involved in establishing data centers worldwide to deal with the increasing need for the storage of IoT data. IoT will boost the establishment of distributed data centers, large data centers, and micro data centers worldwide," adds Sunil. Emergence of containerized data centers A containerized data center is a portable data center pre-installed inside a shipping container. These data centers are part of a modular data center in which each module is a container that can host power, IT, and cooling equipment. These data centers are available in the lengths of 40 feet and 20 feet and are delivered to end-users on demand. Enterprises are building modular data centers that comprise many data center container modules in a single facility. The cost of these facilities is around USD 7 million but may vary based on requirement. The installation to deployment time for these modules is less than six months. A wide range of computing equipment and racks are hosted within a containerized data center facility. The cost of deploying a containerized data center facility is less than the cost of building or renovating a traditional data center facility. Containerized data centers are easy to relocate from one location to another and can be managed centrally. Microsoft's Virginia data center is a modular data center comprising multiple data center containers.

Diehard fans of Windows 7 and 8 will be shut out.

Sign up for TechRepublic's Microsoft Weekly newsletter and get Windows and Office tutorials, plus our experts' analyses of Microsofts enterprise products. Read more Millions of personal computers running at both the enterprise and consumer level have taken the plunge and upgraded to Microsoft Windows 10. For the most part, enterprises and consumers have been pleased with the upgrade and Microsoft has earned the right to consider the new operating system a general success. But that doesn't mean the company has given up on its stated goal of billions of devices running Windows 10. For example, Microsoft has made it quite clear that it will support Intel's and AMD's next generation processors only with Windows 10. In other words, Microsoft will make no promises about the ability of those new CPUs to run Windows 7 or 8. Microsoft wants to put Windows 7 and 8 in its metaphorical rearview mirror and this is just another way to accomplish that mission. SEE: Microsoft jumps into the livestreaming business with its acquisition of Beam Here's your hat... On the one hand, you can understand why Microsoft is committing to the next generation processors. Intel's new processor architecture, code named Kaby Lake, will include new features and technologies that promise to increase the overall performance of devices by significant, and noticeable, percentages. AMD's new processor architecture, code named Zen, makes similar promises. Optimizing Windows 10 to take advantage of these new technologies will require a substantial bit of time and effort. The kind of time and effort Microsoft does not want to duplicate for what it considers old, on their way out, operating systems like Windows 7 and Windows 8. On the other hand, according to the latest information available from Netmarketshare, about 56% of all personal computers as of August 2016 are still running Windows 7, 8.0, or 8.1. Windows 10 has penetrated only about 23% of the available market so far. That means there is a long way to go before the majority of enterprises can be said to have fully deployed Windows 10. Image: Screenshot captured by Mark Kaelin c/o Netmarketshare Those statistics mean that Microsoft will not be able to completely abandon previously released operating systems, no matter how much it wishes it could. The company will have to at least help develop drivers and other behind-the-scenes protocols to account for new processor technologies, even if the older operating systems in question are not optimized. SEE: How Microsoft is creating a better Cortana with the purchase of Genee Bottom line The latest, greatest next generation processors from both Intel and AMD will be supported and optimized only for Windows 10. While this makes sense as a general business strategy for Microsoft, it is likely to cause problems for enterprises and consumers who stubbornly cling to older operating systems like Windows 7 and Windows 8. However, before you get too upset, keep in mind that the general overall architecture of these processors will not change. Kaby Lake and Zen processors will still be based on the x86 architecture, which means that the chips should still run Windows 7 and 8 devices. There may need to be some compensating software in the form of drivers or protocol layers to make it possible, but it can be, and likely will be, done. Of course, performance is likely to suffer because of it. That is why Microsoft wants to make it perfectly clear that the best experience with the soon-to-arrive next generation processors is going to require Windows 10. The writing is on the wall—as far as Microsoft is concerned, Windows 10 is the primary operating system. All earlier versions of Windows are second-class operating systems and will be treated that way going forward. Can your enterprise afford to continue running second-tier software? Are you sure?

The Indian Express Nation World Opinion Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Home Compare News Mobile & Tabs Gadgets Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Tech Reviews RDP ThinBook Review: A budget laptop that is surprisingly good RDP ThinBook Review: A budget laptop that is surprisingly good RDP ThinBook is a budget laptop with great design but does it deliver as an overall Windows PC? We find out in our review Rating: 3.5 out of 5 Written by Karthekayan Iyer | Updated: September 13, 2016 6:42 pm RDP ThinBook is the latest in the growing list of budget Windows 10 notebook developed in collaboration with Microsoft Budget laptops – the ones costing less than Rs 20,000 – are the next big thing in the world of consumer PC segment. Microsoft and Intel both see the segment as the way forward for PC industry – where laptops are essentially replacing desktops as the first computer consumers buy. With Windows 10 becoming cheaper for OEMs and even free for certain screen size, this industry is in the threshold of a significant boom. Microsoft, which has set itself a target of 1 billion Windows 10 devices, has to tap into this very segment in order to achieve its goal. Microsoft has even identified the path to reach that goal – lure mobile OEMs to make Windows 10 PCs – that don’t cost a bomb. With Micromax and Lava already onboard, it was just a matter of time before Microsoft added more companies on its side. RDP ThinBook Just don’t worry if you haven’t heard that name before; I had no idea about this brand either. RDP is the latest to join Microsoft’s budget Windows PC initiative. RDP is, however, approaching the segment differently than Micromax, iBall and Lava. RDP’s first product is not a detachable but a traditional Windows PC and what more, one with really big screen. RDP ThinBook resembles Lenovo’s Ideapad series a lot. It won’t be an understatement to say that RDP ThinBook is completely inspired by the Ideapad series. The moment you unbox the device, that RDP logo placed like Lenovo on the exterior strikes you. RDP has also designed the interior similar to Apple’s flagship MacBook Pro lineup, which is pleasantly surprising from a newbie. A budget laptop that looks this good is always a good sight. But does this one perform considering the demanding needs of a Windows PC? We find out.

The laptop also offers very good battery life with its 10,000mAh battery What is good? The best part about RDP ThinBook is its big 14.1-inch display. The display is not the brightest or the colour saturated one I have come across, but it is certainly on par with several other budget notebooks out there. The advantage of the big screen here is that you can watch videos on a larger screen and it also helps in split-screen multitasking. I still remember my first laptop which felt like carrying bricks on my back. With RDP ThinBook, that issue is gone forever. RDP ThinBook is neither heavy nor too light. The laptop skips on non-essential options like DVD-drive to make room for a larger battery and keep the thickness and weight under control. The overall weight is evenly distributed so you won’t feel the pain while carrying it around the workplace by holding the screen bezel. Again, with these budget notebooks, the showstopper is Windows 10 and not the hardware or design. With RDP ThinBook too, Windows 10 outshines as a complete desktop operating system. Windows 10 pillars around use of Cortana, Microsoft Edge and mobile like notifications. On RDP ThinBook, these core features work absolutely fine. Thanks to the addition of two microphones up front, Cortana can hear you even from relatively far. So shouting, “Hey Cortana, get me driving directions to work” from far will always return a result. Since the laptop is a low-duty one, I faced issues browsing on Chrome, but Edge worked like a charm. RDP ThinBook offers dual microphones for better voice recognition and the laptop works comfortably with Cortana With Windows 10 Anniversary update bringing extensions to Edge, this is the only browser you need on this notebook. Overall, Windows 10 works far better on this low-cost notebook than it would do on your five-year-old PC. I have tested Micromax Canvas Lapbook, iBall Compbook Excelance, Lava Twinpad and now RDP ThinBook and I must say, these budget notebooks deliver on battery front. During my use, I was easily able to browse web, watch video and even write (though I won’t recommend), and yet have some juice left on this one. The laptop is good enough for five hours of constant streaming from the web, decent for that binge-watching session. As far as performance is concerned, RDP ThinBook does fare well with Windows and basic things like browsing the web, accessing media and even multitasking. The laptop is even great for playing games like Crossy Road, but just don’t load this one with Counter Strike. What is not good? The keyboard is not the strongest point of RDP ThinBook. The keys are shallow and I often ended up hitting the wrong key If there is something to dislike about RDP ThinBook, then it has to be its keyboard. Everytime I get a notebook for review, I try to start judging the keyboard right away and I even prefer to use that same keyboard to write the review. In the case of RDP ThinBook, it certainly didn’t hold up well. Firstly, the keyboard is designed similar to Apple’s MacBook Pro with wide space for palm rest around the keyboard. However, that design also means that the keys are more closely packed and there is extremely shallow travel between the keys. Another issue is with the feedback offered by the keys. You often don’t understand whether a key has been pressed or not. Well, I am being too judgemental here and probably you shouldn’t expect much from a budget laptop, but this one could have been better. RDP ThinBook also offers decent option in terms of ports with one USB 3.0, one USB 2.0 and mini HDMI port Another place RDP ThinBook struggles, is with the sound. The speakers on this notebook sound tinny, and the overall volume is very low too. It would be much advisable to invest in good quality speakers. Should you buy? If you are on a tight budget and want a laptop primarily for watching videos then trust me, this one is the only good option. The laptop has a decent keyboard for writing basic reports, but not the one for writing a long thesis. With RDP ThinBook, you can survive your summer holidays watching cat videos, posting on Facebook, chatting on Messenger and if that’s what you are looking for, then this makes a good buying option. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Express TechIE Samsung Galaxy S7 Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Gionee S6 Xiaomi Mi 5 Best of Express 26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & Instagram IndiaBanks to work normal hours on Saturday, but only senior citizens can exchange old notes BusinessDemonetisation: Execution could not have been better, says Arun Jaitley IndiaDemonetisation: Misuse of bank account for black money deposit to invite govt action IndiaLong queues outside banks a ‘serious issue’, says SC on demonetisation IndiaPriyanka Gandhi to play 'major role' in UP Assembly polls: Congress EntertainmentForce 2 movie review: John Abraham, Sonakshi Sinha film is Bond-Bourne rehash EntertainmentChris Martin parties with Shah Rukh Khan, Sussanne Khan and Sridevi's daughters, see inside pics EntertainmentIt's November 18, Salman Khan's wedding day, see pics EntertainmentIulia Vantur reveals what she had to sacrifice to live in India.

Incoming McAfee CEO Chris Young on his company’s post-Intel future Posted Sep 9, 2016 by John Mannes (@JohnMannes) 0 SHARES Next Story User’s guide to Disrupt SF 2016 Advertisement With Intel set to spin off its security unit into a reincarnation of McAfee, attention is quickly turning to Chris Young, the guy tasked with steering the security ship through tumultuous waters and back toward relative independence. Young has been running Intel’s Security Group for quite some time now as senior vice president and general manager. While he will officially be given a CEO title in his new role, the position will be a rare point of continuity for a team that has changed hands twice in the last five years. We sat down with Young to get the scoop on what the transaction means for the future of McAfee and how the company will be challenged in the coming months to navigate a separation from Intel and find its stride in a rapidly changing cybersecurity ecosystem. The history McAfee was founded in 1987 by yoga aficionado and reported real-life Narcos character John McAfee. Some years later, in 2011, chip giant Intel purchased McAfee for $7.68 billion. The transaction was critical in that it tilted the company’s focus toward the hardware layer. This transaction was heavily criticized, but Intel remained bullish that McAfee would support the company’s growth into chip-level security solutions. DeepDefender, a tool for detecting and removing rootkits, became the key product of the acquisition. It leveraged a priority load position to do its work, but ultimately was discontinued by the company in early 2015. McAfee, renamed the Intel Security Group by this point, continued to report growth, but never really met expectations from investors who patiently waited five years for a revolutionary new Intel security product that never came. Latest Crunch Report Tesla Acquisition of SolarCity Approved | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes Shifting toward consumer IoT and full-service enterprise security Wednesday’s announcement marks a significant turning point in McAfee’s history, away from chip-level innovation toward securing the Internet of Things for consumers and consolidating the number of cybersecurity companies enterprises have to work with. While Intel will still own 49 percent of McAfee, Young says the company shouldn’t be seen as half chip company. Young and his investors from TPG, which own 51 percent of the company, have a plan for the future that involves riding that trend of service consolidation by enterprise customers. It’s common for large Fortune 500 companies to have security teams that work with dozens of cybersecurity providers for a slew of niche needs. Young explains that this creates accountability issues and communication problems when a company needs to respond to a hack. McAfee wants to partner and buy its way to the top of the cybersecurity food chain to establish itself as a force within the industry that can connect the growing number of startups in the space via the central McAfee platform. The plan is incredibly ambitious for a company that is on Day Two of finding its identify separate from Intel. Young believes that capital from TPG will enable McAfee to acquire security companies more broadly that may not have fit in with the initial Intel vision. Crunchbase McAfee Founded 1987 Overview McAfee is now part of Intel Security. With its Security Connected strategy, innovative approach to hardware-enhanced security, and unique Global Threat Intelligence, Intel Security is intensely focused on developing proactive, proven security solutions and services that protect systems, networks, and mobile devices for business and personal use around the world. Intel Security combines the experience … Location Santa Clara, CA Categories Network Security, Security, Enterprise Software Website http://www.mcafee.com Full profile for McAfee Intel Founded 1968 Overview Intel designs, manufactures, and sells integrated digital technology platforms worldwide. The company operates through PC client, data center, Internet of Things, mobile and communications groups; software and services; and all other segments. Its platforms are used in various computing applications comprising notebooks, desktops, servers, tablets, smartphones, wireless and wired connectivity products, … Location Santa Clara, CA Categories Semiconductor, Hardware, Software, Manufacturing Website http://www.intel.com/ Full profile for Intel McAfee still has offices co-located with Intel, but will be moving offsite in the future. Amidst all the change, employees have been anxious about what they are expected to do during the transition. Despite lofty goals, Young is instructing employees to “just keep doing what they have been doing.” A transaction of such large magnitude is more than enough to keep him busy ironing out financial details and establishing the organizational structure, leadership and vision for the company. When the dust settles, and Young has forged a company identity, McAfee will focus on securing enterprise data centers. He also wants the company to continue working with device manufacturers and service providers to bolster the security of things we use every day, like cloud storage, communication and file sharing. For consumers, focus will remain on offering a one-stop shop for simplifying security. McAfee’s enterprise division is larger than its consumer division, but not by much. Users should be able to purchase a single security solution that can evolve and remain device-agnostic. This is what sets McAfee apart from device manufacturers that secure their own devices, says Young. And while the Internet of Things has been mostly underwhelming to date, McAfee will be further developing partnerships to put an end to vulnerabilities on the accessories we use with our core devices.

The 16nm FinFET GPUs use Nv's Pascal architecture and follow on from the P100 launched in June. The P4 fits on a half-height, half-length PCIe card for scale-out servers, while the beefier P40 has its eyes set on scale-up boxes. The new pair are aimed mainly at inference work, ie: you give the hardware a trained AI model, some suitable software, and input data like video from a camera or sound from a microphone, and it spits out decisions, speech-to-text translations, object classifications, and so on. We've reached the stage now where deep-learning models are so elaborate – having being constructed on powerful systems using mountains of training data – that the inference side has to catch up: you need a decent number-crunching processor to push information through a complex neural network to make decisions in real time. That's good news for Intel, Nvidia and others because it means they can sell high-end chips for training and inference, but bad news for us punters: it means more and more data must be shipped off to the cloud, processed there, and the results shipped back to our phones, tablets, gadgets and gizmos, increasing our reliance on stable internet connections and trust in far-away platforms. Roy Kim, a senior Nvidia product manager, told us the way forward is a "hybrid" approach, with a less-accurate model on the device so that decisions can be made immediately while a more powerful backend processes the situation and returns a more nuanced decision. State-of-the-art image-recognition systems have more than 150 layers of neurons, said Kim, hence the need for some more oomph on the inference side. What's new? To maximize inference throughput, so your IoT personal-assistant-in-the-cloud doesn't leave you hanging for too long when you ask it a question, Nvidia has added two instructions to its Pascal architecture: IDP2A and IDP4A. These perform two and four-element 8-bit vector dot product calculations with a 32-bit accumulation. If I was a moron hack I would right now wax lyrically about Nvidia embracing the good old days of the 6502 or Z80, but I'll spare you that crap. Basically, data scientists say 8-bit precision is fine for neural networks, and that allows GPUs to shuttle around more bytes than they would if they were crunching wider 16-bit or 32-bit values. You don't need that level of precision when rippling input data through deep levels of perceptrons. Google's TensorFlow-accelerating ASIC uses eight bits for inference, we understand. And Intel and AMD chips can also blast through 8-bit vectors. Dot what? Vector dot products are at the heart of artificial neural networks. At the core of all the AI hype at the moment are strings of math equations – dot products and other formula – that extract features from input data, or in plainer English, identify interesting things in information from sensors, cameras and so on, so that software can act on it. This is done by assembling, or training, a network that data flows into and trickles along various paths with different weightings on them, until an answer is formed. The weights are assigned during training to detect features in incoming data. You can find a gentle introduction to how this works over here, and more involved tutorials here and here [PDF]. The diagram of a single neuron below looks horrific but it's not as scary as you think. You've got values x1 to xn coming in on the left along n paths. Each xi input value is multiplied by its path's weight wi, and then the results of these multiplications are all added up. That's the dot product part. Then that sum is fed into a threshold or activation function, and that output is fed into the next perceptron in the network. When you link these together you get something looking like this basic network, which has two inputs, three neurons, and an output. Let's take just the top neuron. It takes the M input value, multiplies it by the weight θ1, and adds the result to J multiplied by θ2. It takes that sum, runs it through an activation function, and feeds the result into the furthest right neuron. So, ignoring the activation function, that top neuron's dot-product output is: (M x θ1) + (J x θ2). Now imagine those variables are each 8-bit integers ranging from -127 to 127, or 0 to 255. Now imagine doing up to 47 trillion of those dot-product operations a second, all combining inputs to feed into the next stages of a network. That's what Nvidia's P40 is claiming to do. That's what Nv means by accelerated 8-bit dot product calculations. Nvidia also claims its P4 can do, at its very best, 21.8 trillion operations a second using 8-bit integers, and that the P4 is "40 times more efficient" than an Intel Xeon E5 CPU in terms of the number of images classified per second per watt using an AlexaNet-trained model. That's after you've taken your AI model and squashed it down to 8-bit weights. This apparently works well for models trained to recognize speech, and is also good for classifying images and similar inference work.

The P40 is basically a slightly beefier Titan X. Meanwhile, Nvidia has released TensorRT, an inference engine to run on its hardware, and a software development kit called Deepstream, which can identify people and objects in high-resolution (HEVC, VP9) video. ® Sponsored: Transforming software delivery with DevOps Tips and corrections 24 Comments More from The Register Nvidia, Samsung pump brakes in car-crash GPU patent rip-off race After swerving through the courts with lawsuits, tech giants call last-minute truce 4 Comments Nvidia's financials have great numbers.

AMD Zen & Intel Kaby Lake - Neue Desktop-CPUs angeblich verspätet Die neuen Prozessoren von AMD und Intel werden laut neuen Berichten aus Asien wohl einige Wochen später erhältlich sein als bisher gedacht. Von Georg Wieselsberger | Datum: 13.09.2016 ; 10:04 Uhr Kommentare (24) AMDs Zen wird angeblich erst ab Februar 2017 erhältlich sein, doch auch Intels Kaby Lake S für den Desktop soll sich verspäten. Schon seit Wochen gibt es Gerüchte darüber, das AMD und Intel ihre neuen Desktop-Prozessoren Zen und Kaby Lake S auf der Consumer Electronic Show Anfang Januar 2017 in Las Vegas vorstellen werden. AMD-CEO Lisa Su hatte zuletzt davon gesprochen, dass die Zen-Prozessoren mit dem Codenamen »Summit Ridge« im 1. Quartal 2017 in größeren Mengen ausgeliefert wird, es aber vielleicht schon Ende 2016 eine kleinere Lieferung geben könnte. Nun meldet die Webseite Benchlife, dass die neuen Prozessoren wohl erst im Februar 2017 wirklich erhältlich sein werden. Gleichzeitig wird es neue Mainboards mit Sockel AM4 und dem High-End-Chipsatz X370 und den kleineren Versionen B350 und A320 geben. Die Mainboards sollen auch der Grund dafür sein, dass Zen wohl erst im Februar 2017 startet, da die Hersteller Zeit benötigen, um ausreichende Lagerbestände ihrer Produkte aufbauen zu können. Intel wird aber laut der gleichen Meldung von dieser eventuellen Verzögerung von Zen keinen Vorteil ziehen können, denn auch die Desktop-Prozessoren der Kaby-Lake-S-Serie sollen sich verspäten. Intel werde zwar wie erwartet die neuen Prozessoren samt dem Top-Modell Core i7 7700K auf der CES vorstellen, allerdings dann nicht wie üblich mit der Auslieferung größerer Mengen beginnen. Den Grund für die Verschiebung von Kaby Lake S nennt die Webseite in diesem Fall aber nicht. Die noch leistungsfähigeren Intel-Prozessoren der Skylake-X und Kaby-Lake-X-Serien, die einen neuen Sockel 2066 verwenden, werden laut einer Roadmap erst nach dem 2. Quartal 2017 erscheinen. Der Februar 2017 oder zumindest das 1. Quartal 2017 könnten im Bereich der Prozessoren der interessanteste Zeitraum seit vielen Jahren werden und wird zeigen, ob AMD wirklich wieder mit Intel konkurrieren kann.

Sep 2016, 10:30 Ich werde nächstes Jahr ein Upgrade für mein System machen (seit über 4 Jahre den 3770K, wird langsam Zeit ^^) und tendiere ganz stark zu AMD, vorausgesetzt, sie können leistungsmäßig halten, was man bisher so hört. Ich drücke die Daumen, für ALLE Konsumenten. =>  (18)  |   (3) Geschwurbel #2 | 13. Sep 2016, 10:31 Und seit wann interessiert es die Hersteller und den Handel, ob große Lagerbestände existieren, oder nicht? Sobald es Mainboards für Sockel AM4 gibt, gelangen die auch in den Verkauf und die entsprechenden Prozessoren ebenfalls, sofern fertig. Kein Hersteller baut erst irgendwelche Lagerbestände auf um dann erst Produkte zu veröffentlichen. Das wäre ja völlig dämlich. Somit hätte man Lagerhaltungskosten und würde gleichzeitig die Handelspreise drücken, indem man die Nachfrage ausreichend bedient. Wenig Lagerbestand und eine knappe Verfügbarkeit bedeuten doch weniger Kosten und höhere Einnahmen pro Einheit. Würden die Hersteller tatsächlich erst bestimmte Mengen auf Halde produzieren, dann gäbe es die "Paperlaunches" doch nicht immer wieder.  (11)  |   (2) hansus #3 | 13.

Naja, aber nach dem "Paperlaunch" kommt halt irgendwann auch der "reale Launch". Und für ebendiesen wird halt auch mal irgendwann produziert oder? Klingt jetzt nicht so unplausibel für mich.  (4)  |   (0) Rollora #5 | 13. Sep 2016, 10:47 Es war eigentlich immer bekannt, dass es für normalsterbliche erst im Frühjahr kaufbare ZEN Modelle geben wird. Der Zen 2016 Launch bezog sich stets auf die offizielle Vorstellung und eventuell noch Server-CPUs, nicht aber auf eine große Verfügbarkeit von Desktop-CPUs (was schade ist, weil Weihnachten...)  (3)  |   (0) CPilot #6 | 13.

Was nützt es denn wenn du Was auf dem Markt wirfst, wenn aber die anderen Komponenten, die zum Betrieb wichtig sind, fehlen? Die Tatsache das JEDER Herstellender Betrieb einen gewissen Stock aufbaut von einem Produkt hat den Hintergrund, das man den Markt bedienen kann und nicht in den Ruf des "nicht erhältlich" reinrutscht. Was macht den der Konsument, wenn von Produkt "X" nichts oder nur sehr vereinzelt erhältlich ist? Der Konsument geht schlimmstenfalls zur Konkurenz. Man Verkauft und Liefert einem Kunden ja auch kein Auto sollange die Räder nicht auch geliefert und Montiert wurden. Nach deinem Denken wäre ein Supermarkt super klein, weil du ja NUR ein Produkt benötigst und wenn du was haben möchtest wird erst dann, Die Kuh gemolken, das Tier geschlachtet, das Korn gesäht...  (3)  |   (0) Andre_75 #7 | 13. Sep 2016, 11:11 Was bringt es ein Produkt auf den Markt zu bringen wenn man nicht genug davon hat um es auch anbieten zu können? Ist doch bei allem so, stell dir vor Apple haut das neue iPhone heute auf den Markt, da es fertig entwickelt ist, aber hat kaum welche produziert und kann somit nur ein paar Kunden beliefern. Das bringt es nicht.  (1)  |   (0) TheSam #8 | 13. Sep 2016, 11:20 ---  (0)  |   (0) ethnix #9 | 13. Sep 2016, 11:27 Vielleicht schicke ich meinen Ivy Bridge in Rente.

News Room SOURCE: NVIDIA September 12, 2016 23:00 ET New NVIDIA Pascal GPUs Accelerate Deep Learning Inference Tesla P4, P40 Accelerators Deliver 45x Faster AI; TensorRT and DeepStream Software Boost AI for Video Inferencing BEIJING, CHINA--(Marketwired - Sep 12, 2016) - GPU Technology Conference China - NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today unveiled the latest additions to its Pascal™ architecture-based deep learning platform, with new NVIDIA® Tesla® P4 and P40 GPU accelerators and new software that deliver massive leaps in efficiency and speed to accelerate inferencing production workloads for artificial intelligence services. Modern AI services such as voice-activated assistance, email spam filters, and movie and product recommendation engines are rapidly growing in complexity, requiring up to 10x more compute compared to neural networks from a year ago. Current CPU-based technology isn't capable of delivering real-time responsiveness required for modern AI services, leading to a poor user experience. The Tesla P4 and P40 are specifically designed for inferencing, which uses trained deep neural networks to recognize speech, images or text in response to queries from users and devices. Based on the Pascal architecture, these GPUs feature specialized inference instructions based on 8-bit (INT8) operations, delivering 45x faster response than CPUs1 and a 4x improvement over GPU solutions launched less than a year ago.2 The Tesla P4 delivers the highest energy efficiency for data centers. It fits in any server with its small form-factor and low-power design, which starts at 50 watts, helping make it 40x more energy efficient than CPUs for inferencing in production workloads.3 A single server with a single Tesla P4 replaces 13 CPU-only servers for video inferencing workloads,4 delivering over 8x savings in total cost of ownership, including server and power costs. The Tesla P40 delivers maximum throughput for deep learning workloads. With 47 tera-operations per second (TOPS) of inference performance with INT8 instructions, a server with eight Tesla P40 accelerators can replace the performance of more than 140 CPU servers.5 At approximately $5,000 per CPU server, this results in savings of more than $650,000 in server acquisition cost. "With the Tesla P100 and now Tesla P4 and P40, NVIDIA offers the only end-to-end deep learning platform for the data center, unlocking the enormous power of AI for a broad range of industries," said Ian Buck, general manager of accelerated computing at NVIDIA. "They slash training time from days to hours. They enable insight to be extracted instantly. And they produce real-time responses for consumers from AI-powered services." Software Tools for Faster Inferencing Complementing the Tesla P4 and P40 are two software innovations to accelerate AI inferencing: NVIDIA TensorRT and the NVIDIA DeepStream SDK. TensorRT is a library created for optimizing deep learning models for production deployment that delivers instant responsiveness for the most complex networks. It maximizes throughput and efficiency of deep learning applications by taking trained neural nets -- defined with 32-bit or 16-bit operations -- and optimizing them for reduced precision INT8 operations. NVIDIA DeepStream SDK taps into the power of a Pascal server to simultaneously decode and analyze up to 93 HD video streams in real time compared with seven streams with dual CPUs.6 This addresses one of the grand challenges of AI: understanding video content at-scale for applications such as self-driving cars, interactive robots, filtering and ad placement. Integrating deep learning into video applications allows companies to offer smart, innovative video services that were previously impossible to deliver. Leap Forward for Customers NVIDIA customers are delivering increasingly more innovative AI services that require the highest compute performance. "Delivering simple and responsive experiences to each of our users is very important to us," said Greg Diamos, senior researcher at Baidu. "We have deployed NVIDIA GPUs in production to provide AI-powered services such as our Deep Speech 2 system and the use of GPUs enables a level of responsiveness that would not be possible on un-accelerated servers. Pascal with its INT8 capabilities will provide an even bigger leap forward and we look forward to delivering even better experiences to our users." Specifications Specifications of the Tesla P4 and P40 GPUs include: Specification Tesla P4 Tesla P40 Single Precision FLOPS* 5.5 12 INT8 TOPS* (Tera-Operations Per Second) 22 47 CUDA Cores 2,560 3,840 GPU GDDR5 Memory 8GB 24GB Memory Bandwidth 192GB/s 346GB/s Power 50 Watt (or higher) 250 Watt * With boost clock on Availability The NVIDIA Tesla P4 and P40 are planned to be available in November and October, respectively, in qualified servers offered by ODM, OEM and channel partners.

Modern AI services such as voice-activated assistance, email spam filters, and movie and product recommendation engines are rapidly growing in complexity, requiring up to 10x more compute compared to neural networks from a year ago. Current CPU-based technology isn't capable of delivering real-time responsiveness required for modern AI services, leading to a poor user experience. The Tesla P4 and P40 are specifically designed for inferencing, which uses trained deep neural networks to recognize speech, images or text in response to queries from users and devices. Based on the Pascal architecture, these GPUs feature specialized inference instructions based on 8-bit (INT8) operations, delivering 45x faster response than CPUs1 and a 4x improvement over GPU solutions launched less than a year ago.2 The Tesla P4 delivers the highest energy efficiency for data centers. It fits in any server with its small form-factor and low-power design, which starts at 50 watts, helping make it 40x more energy efficient than CPUs for inferencing in production workloads.3 A single server with a single Tesla P4 replaces 13 CPU-only servers for video inferencing workloads,4 delivering over 8x savings in total cost of ownership, including server and power costs. The Tesla P40 delivers maximum throughput for deep learning workloads. With 47 tera-operations per second (TOPS) of inference performance with INT8 instructions, a server with eight Tesla P40 accelerators can replace the performance of more than 140 CPU servers.5 At approximately $5,000 per CPU server, this results in savings of more than $650,000 in server acquisition cost. "With the Tesla P100 and now Tesla P4 and P40, NVIDIA offers the only end-to-end deep learning platform for the data center, unlocking the enormous power of AI for a broad range of industries," said Ian Buck, general manager of accelerated computing at NVIDIA. "They slash training time from days to hours. They enable insight to be extracted instantly. And they produce real-time responses for consumers from AI-powered services." Software Tools for Faster Inferencing Complementing the Tesla P4 and P40 are two software innovations to accelerate AI inferencing: NVIDIA TensorRT and the NVIDIA DeepStream SDK. TensorRT is a library created for optimizing deep learning models for production deployment that delivers instant responsiveness for the most complex networks. It maximizes throughput and efficiency of deep learning applications by taking trained neural nets -- defined with 32-bit or 16-bit operations -- and optimizing them for reduced precision INT8 operations. NVIDIA DeepStream SDK taps into the power of a Pascal server to simultaneously decode and analyze up to 93 HD video streams in real time compared with seven streams with dual CPUs.6 This addresses one of the grand challenges of AI: understanding video content at-scale for applications such as self-driving cars, interactive robots, filtering and ad placement. Integrating deep learning into video applications allows companies to offer smart, innovative video services that were previously impossible to deliver. Leap Forward for Customers NVIDIA customers are delivering increasingly more innovative AI services that require the highest compute performance. "Delivering simple and responsive experiences to each of our users is very important to us," said Greg Diamos, senior researcher at Baidu. "We have deployed NVIDIA GPUs in production to provide AI-powered services such as our Deep Speech 2 system and the use of GPUs enables a level of responsiveness that would not be possible on un-accelerated servers. Pascal with its INT8 capabilities will provide an even bigger leap forward and we look forward to delivering even better experiences to our users."

[Photo: courtesy of Apple] Mark Sullivan 09.12.16 6:15 PM In the fine print of the iPhone 7 documentation is the detail that the AT&T and T-Mobile versions of the new device won’t work on Sprint’s and Verizon’s CDMA cell networks. Why? For a long time iPhones were one-size-fits-all-networks phones, but the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus each come in two different versions (or SKUs, in industry-speak), one with an Intel modem chip inside and one with a Qualcomm modem. The Intel 7630 modem doesn’t work with Sprint’s and Verizon’s 3G CDMA networks, so all Sprint and Verizon customers will get an iPhone 7 with a Qualcomm chip inside. For everyone else, the iPhone 7 could have either an Intel or a Qualcomm modem. It’s thought that Qualcomm will end up supplying the modems for 60% to 70% of the iPhone 7s, a source with knowledge of the business tells me, but that depends on sales geographically and how well Intel delivers its share of the modems. Dual-Sourcing Having more than one iPhone SKU complicates things a bit for Apple, it has good reason for doing it. Dual-sourcing the modems in the iPhone 7 also give Apple the leverage it likes over its suppliers. That applies not only to component prices but also to timeframes, quantity numbers, and the level of customization of the produce being delivered. But there’s way more to it. Managing Network Complexity Apple created another SKU of the iPhone 7 because the RF (radio frequency) technology it was having to stuff into a single SKU to accommodate the growing number of wireless carriers around the world, and the level of complexity in their networks, was becoming unmanageable. For example, carriers increasingly combine two distinct spectrum bands to increase broadband capacity (carrier aggregation). As the number and complexity of networks grow, Apple has to add more radio hardware (like amplifiers, filters, and switches) to the iPhone to accommodate it all. That adds cost to each phone, which cuts into margin. Samsung, by comparison, uses five SKUs for its Galaxy S7. Intel/Apple Past And Future There are other reasons for the additional SKU, and some of it very likely has to do with Apple’s current and future relationship with Intel. The Intel 7360 modem[Photo: courtesy of Intel Corporation] The Intel 7360 modem in the iPhone 7 was originally developed by Infinion (which Intel bought) and was fabricated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Limited (TSMC). In the first few years of the iPhone, when AT&T had an exclusive on the device, Infinion supplied modems for the phone. This was fine, because Infinion’s modem didn’t need to support CDMA networks, only AT&T’s GSM network. After Verizon finally got the phone in early 2011, Apple decided it wanted to support only one modem, so it defaulted to the Qualcomm modem that supported both network flavors. Fabrication Today Intel has its own growing fabrication business that might one day bake modem chips that go inside iPhones. Intel’s next generation modem, the 7460, will very likely be fabricated at Intel using the company’s 14nm process. That’s likely to help create a smaller and more efficient modem for the iPhone. Long, long ago in a Valley not so far away, Intel famously, and tragically, underestimated the future of mobile, and so ceded almost all of the mobile chip business to rival Qualcomm. Intel has been working with Apple for the past few years to guide the development of the 7360. By October 2015 Intel had at least a 1,000 people working on this failure-not-an-option project. In fact, Intel, my source said, is willing to put as many people to work on the Apple project as it takes to keep the whole thing afloat and meeting deadlines. Long, long ago in a Valley not so far away, Intel famously, and tragically, underestimated the future of mobile . . . The end game for Apple may be to work with Intel to co-design a future system on a chip (SoC) that includes the modem, Apple Ax CPU, GPU, and many other components on one chip. This unified design can reduce the space the chips take up inside the phone, reduce the heat they emit, and reduce the power they require. The whole thing may be fabricated at Intel fabrication facilities. Apple’s goal is to spend less money on things like modems that are invisible to customers, and more money on things like the display that users are constantly aware of. That’s why in the iPhone you’ll very likely see Apple move to an OLED display, our source said, which are about twice as expensive as the displays used in iPhones today. Apple must make up that cost by saving money somewhere else in the design in order to keep its margin intact. As for the financial terms of the arrangement, Intel is now negotiating from a position of weakness, great as its need to get in the mobile game. But the whole thing could end up benefiting both tech companies greatly. Apple may be able to better control modem price and quality, and increase its leverage with Qualcomm. For Intel, a big design win with the most popular phone on earth is a pretty nice way to make a dramatic re-entrance in the mobile chip business.

Apple seems to be within striking distance of Intel's best ultra-low-power notebook and convertible processors. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Sep 12, 2016 at 5:19PM Image source: Intel.  If there's one company in the industry that seems to be able to challenge Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in terms of mobile processors, it's Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The latter has been making significant strides in its mobile processor technology, which allowed it to come within striking distance of Intel's best ultra-low-power processors with its A9X chip. Indeed, according to Geekbench 4 -- a new performance test that allows for cross-platform comparisons of processor capabilities -- the A9X chip inside the iPad Pro manages to score 3011 points in the single-core test and 4882 in the multi-core test. The top score that I could find for Intel's best 4.5-watt Core m processor, the Core m 6Y75, is a single-core score of 3677 and a multi-core score of 6983. Based on these results, Intel's chip is solidly in the lead, and Intel has a new chip for this segment based on its new Kaby Lake architecture out. However, based on the performance results of Apple's new A10 Fusion chip inside the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, the competition between Intel and Apple for mobile processor performance superiority is sure to heat up. Trying to predict the future The highest A10 Fusion score I could find in the Geekbench 4 data base is 3501 on a single core and 5631 when both cores are active. This means that, at least in Geekbench 4, the A10 Fusion has roughly the same single-core processor performance as Intel's top sixth-generation Core m processor. Intel's chip still has a lead-in multi-core, though, probably because Intel's core implements a feature known as Simultaneous Multi-Threading, which allows for better utilization of a core's resources in applications that can take advantage of multiple cores. However, the A10 Fusion to Core m 6Y75 comparison isn't that interesting. What will be much more interesting is the comparison of the upcoming A10X (Fusion?) that will be used in Apple's 2017 iPad lineup with Intel's recently announced 4.5-watt Core i7-7Y75, the direct replacement for the Core m 6Y75. With the A10X, Apple will enjoy an expanded power budget and is expected to migrate to a new 10-nanometer manufacturing technology from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM). These factors combined should allow Apple to crank up the processor performance inside its next-generation tablet processor. The Core i7-7Y75 from Intel is manufactured on Intel's revised 14-nanometer+ process, which allows the company to dial up the maximum single-core turbo on the chip from 3.1GHz on the 6Y75 to 3.6GHz on the 7Y75, a 16% improvement. If performance on the 7Y75 scales linearly with frequency in the Geekbench 4 test, we should see a single-core score of roughly 4265 and a multi-core score of about 8100. Moving to the A10X, let's assume that the delta between the A10 and A10X is roughly the same as the delta between the A9 and A9X. The A9X's single core score was about 21% better than the A9's and the multi-core score was about 17% better. In that case, our hypothetical A10X should get a single-core score of 4236 and a multi-core score of 6588.27. In tasks that use just a single core, the A10X should be roughly even with the Core i7-7Y75 and behind it in tasks that use multiple cores. Apple is really close to Intel It's clear that in terms of per-core performance in ultra-mobile power envelopes, Apple and Intel are essentially within spitting distance of each other. This isn't a knock on Intel, but rather a demonstration of just how good Apple's processor core development team is. In multi-core performance, Intel should still enjoy a lead. However, I wouldn't be surprised to see Apple's engineers implement simultaneous multithreading in a future processor core -- perhaps in the A11/A11X -- to try to close the multi-core gap with Intel. In this case, Apple could market future iPads as having similar performance to its future top-end thin-and-light MacBooks -- an exciting prospect for iPad users, but perhaps an uncomfortable one for Intel.

However, a virtual world like Grand Theft Auto allows computers to step in and complete the labeling in just seconds. HOW DOES THE AI WORK?  Using computer vision algorithms, the team can label thousands of objects in a few hours, which can be used to teach self-driving object recognition.  To begin their work, researchers extracted 25 thousand frames from Grand Theft Auto V that varied in weather conditions and took place during different times of day Grand Theft Auto may not be the first place you'd go to learn better driving skills, but researchers are using this fictional world to train self-driving cars. Pictured are the colours used by the AI to label objects in Grand Theft Auto V Then, using computer vision algorithms, the team annotated all of the images in just 49 hours. For each image taken from the game, the team added a corresponding ID map  that identifies the mesh, texture and shade found with a specific pixel. Then the team broke down each image into patches for pixels that share common characteristics. The team from Intel Labs and Darmstadt University set out to investigate if Grand Theft Auto could be a solution for both of these challenges.

Using Grand Theft Auto allows computers to step in and complete the labeling in just seconds - which takes hours by hand and is tough finding the scenarios.

Then the team broke down each image into patches for pixels that share common characteristics. And they used colours to group the objects together, which is key for the self-driving cars to decipher what is being shown in the virtual scene.  For each image taken from the game, the team added a corresponding ID map that identifies the mesh, texture and shade found with a specific pixel. Then the team broke down each image into patches for pixels that share common characteristics 'Although the source code and the internal operation of commercial games are inaccessible, we show that associations between image patches can be reconstructed from the communication between the game and the graphics hardware,' reads the paper. 'This enables rapid propagation of semantic labels within and across images synthesized by the game, with no access to the source code or the content.' Researchers believe this technology could be used to produce continuous video streams, in addition to using the system to produce ground-truth data for many dense prediction problems. Researchers believe this technology could be used to produce continuous video streams, in addition to, using the system to product ground-truth data for many dense prediction problems This new method will not only provide real world scenarios for self-driving cars to learn, but it is also less time consuming and demanding. The current method requires human researchers to comb through scenes and draw borders around objects 'Annotating real-world data is an expensive operation and the current approaches do not scale up easily,' Alizera Shafaei, a PhD student at the University of British Columbia (UBC) who recently coauthored a paper showing how video games can be used to train a computer vision system, in some cases as well as real data can, told MIT News. 'With artificial environments we can effortlessly gather precisely annotated data at a larger scale with a considerable amount of variation in lighting and climate settings.' 'We showed that this synthetic data is almost as good, or sometimes even better, than using real data for training.' GOOGLE REVEALS STRANGE THINGS ITS CARS HAVE SEEN In a recent monthly report, Google highlighted a few of these bizarre incidents, which the firm says are key to the cars ability to deal with unpredictable road behavior.  In Mountain View, California Google's self-driving car witnessed a broom wielding woman chasing a duck in the ride while riding an electric wheel chair. Another strange incident occurred at an intersection, when three non-related cars each made a turn down a one-way, which was the opposite way they were traveling. However, Chris Urmson, director of Google's self-driving car project, says Austin 'takes the cake'. A group of children were seen playing Frogger around the autonomous vehicle. A separate occasion, a man came out of nowhere and rolled over the hood of the car - similar to the move in Starksy & Hutch. And finally, a gentleman was so excited to see the Google car on his street that he ran out completely naked. 'On our private test track, we've dreamt up and recreated hundreds of odd scenarios to gauge our car's response, but situations like these demonstrate why public testing of our self-driving cars is important to developing our cars for the road,' Google stated in the firm's March report detailing its autonomous vehicle progress. 'We can try to come up with lots of wacky situations for our cars to handle, but the real world can defy even our wildest imaginations.'    Read more: Self-Driving Cars Can Learn a Lot by Playing Grand Theft Auto download.visinf....

It's all "inside baseball" and our traffic patterns suggest that our audience isn't terribly interested in inside baseball unless it's a really big deal. Well, within the API economy, you'd be hard-pressed to find a bigger deal than Google acquiring API management solution provider Apigee. On the one hand, no one I know saw this coming. On the other, we might have anticipated it. Hindsight is, of course 20/20.  So, how did we get to this point in the API economy's history? First and foremost, some interesting numbers: Apigee went public in April 2015 at $17 per share and it's been a bit of a rocky ride ever since. On the day of its IPO, it briefly rose to $20 per share before closing on the downside at $16.68. Google has agreed to acquire Apigee for $625M which works out to be about $17.40 per share. During Apigee's outing as a public company, some pundits were mistakenly bullish. In 2014, on the eve of Apigee's IPO, SeekingAlpha's Don Dion called it the "Tech Buy of the Week." In September 2015, Zacks Equity Research called Apigee "a great momentum stock." I have no insight into whether Apigee's investors got what they hoped for (sometimes they take the money and run at the IPO, other times not). But I know enough to know that most public companies do not view an acquisition at 40 cents north of their IPO price to be a stellar outcome. For Google though, it was a good deal. Maybe not as good as it would have been had it tried to make the buy in February when the company was trading at its 52-week low of $5.35. In its coverage of the deal, Recode said that "sources in the industry applauded the deal as smart (and thrifty) for Google." While I'm sure no one at Google sneezed at the deal, perhaps it helps to put it into financial perspective: Google's total value (its market cap) typically fluctates on a daily basis by more than 10x the price it paid for Apigee. Google's acquisition of Apigee is the third such acquisition of an API management pure play in the last year (give or take a few days). By "API management pure play," I mean a solution provider that focuses exclusively on the management of the API lifecycle. In August 2015, Tibco, a company more traditionally know for solutions that dealt with enterprise integration and the business logic-driven hosting and choreography of event-driven workflows, acquired Mashery from Intel. Intel had previously acquired Mashery in April 2013 for about $180 million.  Then, in June of this year, Red Hat, another company with strengths in integration and business logic, announced it would be acquiring API management pure-play 3Scale. And now, Google is acquiring Apigee.  To the untrained eye, the pattern isn't so clear. But to just about anybody that keeps an eye on the integration and API management sectors, it should be obvious. Back in the old days of XML-RPC styled Web services (which are not very old) and beyond, the art of meshing large often dissimilar software systems involved a fair amount of business logic that lived at the heart of what would become known as an integration platform. Deep inside, often driven by Java source code that mirrored an enterprise's business processes, these platforms could support the sort of workflows whereby data flowing from one foreign system to another could be transformed and massaged for suitability to the recipient. And just some data's sudden arrival into one of these workflows was treated as an event that might trigger some other business process that was hosted by the same platform. Typically, wiring these platforms up to the various enterprise systems like those from Oracle or SAP required bespoke software connectors; essentially compatability shims that lived between the integration platform and the softwares that were being pulled into the integration mix. If you were to diagram it, the brains (to handle the business logic) were in the middle with the connectors on the edge, living in the seams between the business logic and the foreign systems. Then, Web APIs came along and, to make a long story short, due to their reliance on existing HTTP standards (HTTP is the standard protocol that makes the Web tick), they started to take a lot of the bespokeness out of the bespoke connectors. Though very different architecturally from their predecessors, fundamentally, APIs didn't change the arrangement of the diagram. Where APIs were replacing connectors (and continue to do so), they were still pretty much at the edge, dealing with the seam. As the world began its shift to Web APIs at the edge, there developed a need for products and services to manage their sprawl and lifecycle which in turn gave rise to API management startups.  One API management pure play -- Mashery -- was probably the first to act on the opportunity. Back in 2006, when I founded Mashup Camp -- the industry's first event to focus exclusively on Web APIs -- one of the event's first sponsors to get in line to talk about what he was up to was Oren Michels; then the founder of Mashery. Clearly a visionary, Michels was talking about the need to manage Web APIs before most people knew what a Web API even was. So new was his startup that he was emailing me from his inbox at mit.edu instead of mashery.com. As a side note (and for those of you who like to connect the dots), the first Mashup Camp in February 2006 at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View is where I met and became great friends with John Musser who had just founded ProgrammableWeb. As the API economy blossomed and the need for API management became more apparent, other pure-plays raced to help tame the edge. One of those was Apigee whose flagship offering is not surprisingly named Apigee Edge. The race included others like Layer 7 and 3Scale. But, as strong as these pure-plays were at what they did, they lacked a part of the diagram that was still important to enterprises; a platform of any sort to deal with business logic (be that for integration or even for a regular business application). As it turned out for their investors, this omission would serve them pretty well because as pure plays, they could be paired with platform providers who one-day woke up to the reality that they had better get hitched to an API management solution. While Web APIs were becoming all the rage at the edge and guys like Oren Michels were right about the need to manage them, enterprises' need to accomodate the business logic part of the diagram was showing no signs of slowing down. Back in the integration world, a small handful of vendors -- Akana (formerly SOA Software), MuleSoft, and WSO2 -- who had found success in providing the logic platforms and connectors looked at the API onslaught and saw the opportunity for a natural marriage to offer what many customers wanted; a single throat to choke for both integration and API management. The result? In the 2012-2013 timeframe, they scrambled their engineering teams to add API management into their product and service portfolios; endeavors that all continue to this day (disclosure: MuleSoft acquired ProgrammableWeb in 2013). Despite routine derision of this marriage by the pure plays as a part of their competitive messaging, the trend that led us up to this week's acquisition of Apigee by Google clearly validates the early thinking that customers are better served by solutions that that can simultaneously deal with both business logic and API management.  While Akana, MuleSoft, and WSO2 chose to engineer their way to such diversification, the first integration vendor to buy its way into a marriage with API management was probably Axway when it acquired Vordel in late 2012.  That was followed by the first acquisition of Mashery by Intel and CA's acquisition of Layer 7 in April 2013. In October of that year, Microsoft saw the potential in the marriage of platform and APIs and acquired Apiphany. In a bit of reporting for ProgrammableWeb that was eerily clairvoyant when it came to Amazon and Google, Michael Vizard wrote: Microsoft immediately turned off the API management service; at least in terms of signing up new customers. Given that the acquisition of Apihany was led by the Microsoft Azure group the expectation is that the Apiphany technology will one day reemerge as a service on Azure. In fact, Microsoft’s end game appears to be an effort to develop an API ecosystem around Azure that will attract enough applications to give the cloud platform the critical mass it needs to compete with rival public cloud services from Amazon and Google. As cloud computing and the API economy increasing converge, major cloud platform providers are trying to ensure their long term viability by creating zones they can dominate within the larger API economy. Google and Amazon have both famously tied the knot between their platforms and API management (although Amazon is still very early in its journey). But not before Intel realized it didn't own a real spouse for Mashery and set about finding one in Tibco, who, as more of a traditional integration company, lacked the prescience in the 2012/2013 timeframe to diversify by building or buying. Likewise, Red Hat may have waited too long to recognize the importance of API management to the customers of its various platforms (especially the Java-driven JBOSS). It dipped its toe in the water with an open source API management solution called APIMAN but ultimately resorted to buying its way into the business with its acquisition of 3Scale. APIMAN is being sunsetted and any of Red Hat's customers looking for ongoing support when it comes to API management will have to transition to the 3Scale technology. Such surprises can be painful and speak to the need to interrogate your solution providers to make sure they (a) have a very clear vision when it comes to the future and (b) are committed to that vision.  Meanwhile, Red Hat wasted no time in drawing attention to the kind of success that's produced when a single vendor can cover a customer for both platform and API management when it announced that Norwegian airport express train operator Flytoget signed up as a customer of both Red Hat's JBoss Fuse and 3Scale's API management technology "as part of an initiative to digitise and automate the company's key value chain." Then, over the course of the last couple of years and in their efforts to marry their development platforms to API management, Amazon, IBM (Bluemix), and Microsoft (Azure) have signficantly ramped their API management capabilities (partially fulfilling Vizard's prohecy regarding Microsoft's acquisition of Apiphany). Earlier this week, when I was at the Government API meetup in Washington, DC (a great meetup if you can ever make it), a group of us were talking about the pattern of API pure plays getting married-off to platform vendors as we tried to answer the question of who would propose to Apigee (it has been no secret that Apigee was looking for a buyer). We ran down the list of possibilities. SAP? Oracle? Both could benefit from a marriage to API management. Perhaps Microsoft or IBM? While they have pre-existing technologies, both are keen to gain more customers and have proven willing to do it through acquisition. The exercise was mainly one of looking for a platform provider of any type that was missing the API management puzzle piece. Never did we guess Google.  But in hindsight, we should have. Google practically gave birth to the API economy when it launched the first Web API (Google Maps) in 2005. Very few companies understand APIs, and invests in them, the way Google does. Not just in providing them the way many other API providers do. But also in advancing the technology behind them. For example, gRPC and Protocol Buffers; both of which could shape the future of APIs. It was just last week that ProgrammableWeb wrote about Google getting serious about API management with the launch of its beta of Google Cloud Endpoints; a solution that can churn out an API for anything you've built on any of the Google Cloud Platform offerings (App Engine, Container Engine and Compute Engine). Applications? Microservices? It doesn't matter. They all need logic. So, very clearly, Google is positioning its solutions to be very prolific providers of APIs. But, whereas Google Cloud Endpoints primarily handles the development and provisioning part, what about the rest of the API lifecycle? Those APIs would have to be managed. So here again, much the same way that Akana, Axway, CA, MuleSoft, and WSO2 set themselves on a strategic course to marry platform with API management nearly four years ago (and others since), Google has recognized the strategic importance of a similar union.  Moving forward however, the acquisition raises several interesting questions and possibilities. For example, Apigee has previously partnered with Amazon to show how to use Apigee for AWS-powered applications. Given that Google Cloud Platform and Amazon AWS are now such fierce competitors in the cloud, will Google be so willing to partner with Amazon (or vice versa) on such endeavors in the future and where does that leave customers of the AWS-specific reference architecture offered by Apigee? [updated after original publication:] Another question, posed in one of the comments below is what this means long-term for Apigee's on-premise solutions given how Google's cloud positioning pretty much eschews anything on-prem. In response, another commenter pointed out how Google senior vice president Diane Greene mentioned in her announcement that Google remains committed to supporting an on-prem solution. Additionally, one of Apigee's strengths was its independence. Most companies could do business with Apigee and remain relatively assured that Apigee would not go into competition with them. Given the many business sectors that Google currently competes in (or may venture into), there's now a stronger possibility that some of Apigee's existing customers and prospects could view Apigee as a foe rather than a friend. What then? What do you think about the acquisition and the long term trend? Is this the end or are there more acquisitions on the way? Feel free to comment below and I'll be sure to respond.

I am been following Apigee since the Sonoa days and believe the acquisition makes a lot of sense, especially to help Google drive into the enterprise space. 2 questions: 1) Would it put a question mark behin Apigee's on-premise offering? Google is know to not believe anything not in the cloud. 2) Would Oracle acquiring Amberpoint back in 2010 qualify as an early version of the trend you cite? david_berlind 8:26 AM Sep. 10 2016 reply Hi @spacelord and thanks so much for replying. In answer to your questions,  1. I think that's just another question worth asking at this point. I am trying to think of an on-premise solution offered by Google and I cannot think of one. That doesn't mean that one doesn't exist. It's just that one doesn't come to mind at the moment.  2. The question you're really asking is whether the acquisition of an older SOA governance solution like Amberpoint qualifies and I just think that depends on your point if view. There's a POV that Services Oriented Infrastructure (SOA) is synonomous with RPC-styled Web services and that Web APIs are something so entirely different that they can barely be discussed in the same breath. It's no surprise that SOA Software changed its name (to Akana). It didn't want the SOA stereotype to sully it's positioning in the API space. If this is your POV, then I'd say the answer is "no" because you've already drawn a line in the sand and one doesn't necessarily carry over into the other. But, my personal POV (and I'm sure I'll get some grief for this) is that Web APIs and the older XML-based APIs are both APIs and that the general architectural concept works off the idea that a software component can be turned into a networkable service to which other software can outsource their tasks. To me, they both fall under the rubric of service-orientation and a lot of people get hung up on semantics. "SOA" turned into a label that it should never have turned into because as a concept, I think Web APIs do a better job of capturing the spirit of service orientation then the older XML-RPC styled APIs do. One need only look at the microservices discussion to agree. Ultimately, microservices are services. Most of them are abstracted by RESTful Web APIs. Are we to suggest that is NOT a services oriented architecture? This is one reason ProgrammableWeb's data model is agnostic to these sorts of semantics.  So, back to Oracle, if acquiring Amberpoint also helped the company to set itself on a strategic path to manage APIs of any feather, to govern service regardless of type, then I'd say yes, it fits into the trend. For example, though we don't hear much about it, Oracle actually has an API management solution. I haven't looked closely, but I'll bet that while it can stand independently, it's also pretty well tuned to Oracle's other solutions. Check out the path in the URL for its home page: http://www.oracle.com/us/products/middleware/soa/api-management/overview... LOL! It's under "SOA." So, what I don't know is how or if Oracle's acquisition of Amberpoint is connected to Oracle's launch of it's API management product (Oct 2015). If they're connected, then absolutely, I think one could say that Amberpoint deserves to be on the timeline because it put Oracle on the path to where it is today.  michels 5:52 PM Sep. 10 2016 reply On the "on premise" solution - there's the Google Search Appliance, but my understanding is that it is being sunsetted. michels 5:48 PM Sep. 10 2016 reply Thanks for the very, very kind words, David. And, as always, your insight into how the pieces are arranging themselves.  When we started Mashery I had a bit of an idea of what we needed to do, but a big part of my "vision" was formed by the amazing people I talked to during our early years. Some of them invested, some joined the Mashery team, and others became customers. But two who were in neither camp stand out. The first is John Musser, who you mention. Rafer and I had previously founded a directory business, so we understood the value of a comprehensive directory to a developing ecosystem, and expected to build one as part of Mashery. But then I found out about programmableweb and this John Musser guy and reached out to him. My first trip on Mashery's dime was to Seattle to see John, who generously offered to meet with me and answer all of my questions even though our respective visions had no shortage of overlap.I quickly realized that Mashery and the entire market would be well served by leaving the directory business to John, and over the years we built a wonderful friendship (and I learned something every time I talked to him). The second, of course, is some guy who had enough vision to start doing events around APIs and founded Mashup Camp, which spawned thousands upon thousands of hackathons in every corner of the globe. For someone new to the API world, it was amazing to be able to attend an event where likeminded people coming at the API concept from all different directions could compare notes and learn from each other. Cheers to you! david_berlind 9:24 AM Sep. 12 2016 reply Hey Oren (@michels), Thanks for writing in here. On the Google Search Appliance, I considered that.... but then I recalled reading that it was being withdrawn from market (as you suggested). Then again, as pointed out by another commenter (@Nick), Diane Greene said that Google is committed to supporting on prem "as always."   Thanks for your kind words too. I agree on John and am thankful to have had the torch passed to me as we take ProgrammableWeb to the next level. So much has changed since those days. We have much work to do and a lot of it is at the foundational level. For example, we've been very busy building out our understanding and record of SDKs that go with all the APIs and we're tuned in like we've never been before to all the API versioning that's happening. So long as there are multiple versions of an API available to developers (not just older versions, but newer pre-release ones too), it changes the idea of having a single record for the closest-production API. So, we're modernizing our data model to reflect the maturity of the API lifecycle.  I'm not sure that we spawned thousands upon thousands of hackathons ... but those sure were the early days of hackathons and I can't be thankful enough for the number of enduring friendships with brilliant people that came as a result of that work. And, had we never done that, I would not be here today at ProgrammableWeb.  It's crazy how one decision (thanks to an after-hours conversation with Google and Flickr) can change your entire life. monohusche 11:18 PM Sep. 11 2016 reply Regarding question 1, not so sure that the picture is that black-and-white. First of all, Google seems to understand that for many enterprises (and that's where Google has to catch up), hybrid cloud is there to stay (at least for now). Hence their increasing involvement with OpenStack which is the main open source private cloud play. Besides, their strategy to world domination is not to exclude other architecture options than public cloud, but just making it easier with their own solutions. So for instance for container orchestration, they have successfully managed to make Kubernetes the main contender, partially by embracing other platforms than just Google Cloud. Of course hoping that a large percentage of potential customer still uses GCP as their public cloud choice, Given the clear synergies of API Mgmt and container orchestration/service discovery, they have announced that they will integrate Kubernetes and Apigee while making it work both in the public cloud and on-prem. see below. From the google blog: "Looking ahead, Kubernetes will be integrated to help enterprises get better control and visibility into how their internal systems talk to one another, an additional part of deploying services. As always, we'll make sure that these capabilities are available in the public clouds and can also be used on-premises." Nick david_berlind 9:03 AM Sep. 12 2016 reply @Nick, thanks so much for writing in with these great points and thanks for pointing out Greene's statement regarding on prem solutions (I've updated the post accordingly!). Although I'd point out that Greene wrote "As always, we'll make sure that these capabilities are available in the public clouds and can also be used on-premises."  On the one hand, "as always?" or is it really more recently in recognition of your point regarding the enterprise need for hybrid cloud support?  That said, she did say "public clouds" which leads you to believe that, at least in this case, she intends to remain cloud agnostic (as should be the case when Kubernetes is involved, right?).  On the "black and white" issue, I don't think I meant to imply that it's strictly a black and white question to the exclusion of all other questions. There are of course many more permutations and possibilities when you consider the great many situations where API management naturally fits like a puzzle piece to a much larger picture that's ultimately more complicated than the one I painted. But, the question still remains given the long-term trend of API management companies getting married off to one platform provider or another.  Today in APIsLatest news about the API economy and newest APIs, delivered daily: Subscribe Leave this field blank API University FOR API PROVIDERS What Are APIs and How Do They Work?8 Real World API Strategies and the Keys to Their SuccessHow To Find a Rockstar API Product Manager More for API Providers  › FOR DEVELOPERS How To Implement Deep Linking in iOSHow To Get Started With Twitter's FabricHow To Develop An Android Wear App More for Developers  › Advertisement   Additional Resources API Growth Charts, Industry Research & More Developer How-to's & Live Presentations Meet The Editors David Berlind Editor in Chief @dberlind Articles Wendell Santos Editor wendell78 Articles Advertisement     Directories & Listings API Directory Mashups and Applications SDKs & Libraries How To's, Source Code Resources About ProgrammableWeb Advertise FAQ Contributed Content Guidelines Get Paid to Write for ProgrammableWeb Contact Us Business & Legal Site Terms of Service Privacy Policy Subscribe Rss Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn

GE Adds Two Startups to Industrial Internet Push Estee Lauder Buys Too Faced Brand for $1.45B In the first half of 2016, Intel’s security division generated $1.1 billion in revenue, up 11% on the year-ago period, but analysts have generally viewed the acquisition of McAfee as a disappointment. “As we collaborate with TPG to establish McAfee as an independent company, we will also share in the future success of the business and in the market demand for top-flight security solutions, creating long-term value for McAfee’s customers, partners, employees and Intel’s shareholders,” Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said in a news release. McAfee is best-known for antivirus programs that protect personal computers hard wired to corporate and personal networks. But as The New York Times reports, “The explosion of smartphones, tablets and laptops, all wirelessly connected to cloud computing systems, has changed the [security] industry. PC sales have shrunk for five years, too, changing Intel’s business plans.” In the security area, Intel has moved into other varieties of software aimed at preventing hackers from breaking into corporate networks. Jeff Pollard, an analyst with Forrester, told Forbes that McAfee is emerging from Intel with a gutted portfolio and its service offering has lost ground to competitors. “McAfee is in need of direction and a turnaround,” he said. TPG has a track record of successful tech deals and recently invested in internet security company Zscaler and information technology vendor Tanium. “Unlike those smaller investments in relatively new technology providers, McAfee gives entree to a host of corporate customers and a platform to make additional and potentially larger deals in cybersecurity,” The Wall Street Journal said.

The essentials: what you need Not sure what 'essentials' you'll need? Check in with your halls guide to find out what the university will be accommodating you with and what you'll be expected to bring. All hall rooms will cover a duvet, bedroom bin and very basic kitchen essentials, but if you're heading to a student house, you may need to start from scratch. Retailers to watch for some of the best bargains are: Wilko.com for cheap duvet sets and bedroom decor. Amazon for laptops and bulk-items like shampoos and toilet roll. Argos for cheap kitchen and bedroom electricals. Poundland for kitchen and bathroom cleaning products. ASDA for food staples and your weekly supermarket shop. eBay for cheap clothes, towels and everything in between. Ikea for £3.50 duvet covers and pots, pans and cutlery. Kettles, duvets, and kitchenware for under £20 Getting kitted out for campus can cost you, or the bank of mum and dad, a fortune. Plus, to make things worse, you feel like you need 'new' EVERYTHING - and you do, sort of. From desk lamps, to duvets and pillows, it all adds up - here's our checklist on how to get kitted out on a budget, from duvets, to dinner sets, towels, mugs and of course, a kettle. You can FINALLY get student discount It's no secret that university is expensive – but there's at least one upside.... Student discounts. Here are some of the best student discount deals going - including 5% off Apple. Your university will provide you with a student card on your first day of term, or when you register on campus. Flash that card whenever you can - wear it as a badge if you must. Which 2016 student bank account is best? (Photo: Getty) Banks have been falling over themselves to get students to bank with them for decades – offering everything from free mobile phones to railcards and just straight out cash to get students to sign up. While your main focus should be on the longest guaranteed 0% overdraft, the only time this rule doesn’t apply is if the freebie offered is more valuable. This year, the top “gift” is a free four-year 16-25 Railcard that is offered to those who open a Santander 123 account. This usually costs £30 a year and gives you a third off railway tickets. Santander’s overdraft offering is not as big as some of the other banks, but you still get up to £1,500 in the first three years of study, followed by £1,800 in year four and £2,000 in year five. Elsewhere, NatWest is offering a National Express Young Persons card offering a third off coach travel, while HSBC is offering 20 per cent off National Express coach travel, a £60 Amazon gift card and one year of Amazon Prime benefits.

About Future Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / SellGPU.com Launches First CPU Trade-In Program SellGPU.com Launches First CPU Trade-In Program Posted on September 12, 2016 by Top News US Full Feed in Press Releases Conceptual image of a businessman holding big hammer Tech startup announces first trade-in program for used CPUs of Intel i3, i5, i7 as well as AMD FX models. Columbus, Ohio (PRWEB) September 12, 2016 After the successful launch of SellGPU.com, the company quickly turned its sights to the CPU market and is now trading-in CPUs as well as graphics cards. The new tech firm purchases CPUs directly from consumers through a fast, easy-to-use, and zero-risk process. The company is now trading-in CPUs of Intel i3, i5, and i7 models from 6th, 5th, 4th, 3rd and 2nd generations, as well as AMD FX processors. Customers have been receiving trade-in offers of up to $450. “SellGPU is attempting to revolutionize PC upgrade cycles,” Hafez said. “We are trying to bring more value to companies and individuals undergoing an upgrade process.” SellGPU.com, a company of gamers, programmers, and hardware enthusiasts, was established to help organizations and individuals with the need for high-end PC components dispose of their old components. Founder and CEO Said Hafez created the company in late 2014 after finding difficulty in getting rid of an old GPU batch. SellGPU offers its customers instant quotes. After the customer accepts his offer, he or she will have the option to receive a free anti-static foam box and prepaid shipping label with which to send the CPU. The customer then simply places the CPU in the box, tapes the box, affixes the shipping label to it, and drops it off at any local post office. Once the CPU reaches SellGPU, it gets inspected and tested. If it passes the testing process, the customer gets paid by PayPal or check within three business days. If the CPU fails the tests, SellGPU returns it free of charge.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Sep 12, 2016 at 9:48AM Image source: Intel.  A little under two months ago, a leak from generally reliable website PC Watch leaked some details about microprocessor giant Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) late 2017-to-2018 desktop and high-performance notebook processor family, known as Coffee Lake. It's not entirely clear what enhancements Intel is making to Coffee Lake, but PC Watch did mention a couple of key tidbits. First, Coffee Lake is expected to be available in two-, four-, and six-core variants. Current Intel desktop processors only go up to four processor cores. Additionally, Coffee Lake is expected to pack Intel's GT3e graphics, a substantial boost from the GT2 graphics that the company ships in its current desktop processors. Although these tech specs are interesting in their own right, Intel wouldn't add cores and graphics unless it felt there were segments of these markets that found value in increased processor core counts and beefed-up graphics. Here are three areas of the desktop personal computer market that could stand to benefit from these enhancements. Accelerating mini-PCs At Intel's 2015 developer forum, the company hosted a presentation in which it talked up the growing popularity of so-called mini-PCs. According to the presentation, the market for mini-PCs is expected to grow from just shy of 6 million units annually to 8 million units by 2018. The company even said that mini-PCs represented "one of the fastest growing segment[s] in desktops." In the following slide, the company highlighted five different form factors, or types, of mini-PCs: Image source: Intel. The upcoming Coffee Lake chips should be suitable for the Mini-ITX and 5x5 form factors listed. The NUC, Mini Lake, and Compute Stick form factors are typically served by low power mobile chips, not high-performance mobile and desktop processors. Indeed, the amount of computing power that Intel should be able to cram into those two form factors should go up by quite a lot. With six cores and beefier on-chip graphics, the Mini-STX systems should be much more capable of handling gaming workloads than current versions are now, for example. This could make these form factors even more attractive to users who want a lot of performance but couldn't quite handle the sacrifices they'd have to make by using current-generation processors. Beefing up gaming notebook computers Another area where Coffee Lake should shine is in gaming-oriented notebooks. Current gaming notebooks are limited to quad-core processors usually paired with separate graphics processors. Although the quad-core processors that gaming notebook manufacturers include in their systems are quite fast, it is possible to buy gaming desktops with six-, eight-, or even 10-core processors. If there is significant demand from vendors of gaming-oriented laptop makers for six-core processors suitable for their highest-end systems -- and I would imagine that gaming notebook vendors would love that particular marketing point -- then it makes sense that Intel would craft products to serve those vendors' needs. Faster, more efficient all-in-one computers Intel has also talked at length about the growth opportunity in all-in-one desktop computers. The additional processor cores that Coffee Lake is expected to bring to the table should enable a significant performance increase, particularly for productivity workloads, such as video and audio encoding, as well as heavy multi-tasking use cases. Additionally, although standalone graphics processors are possible in all-in-one form factors, particularly the larger screen ones, improved graphics built into the Coffee Lake chips should reduce the need for such standalone chips, enabling cheaper systems that draw less power and generate less heat. How does Intel benefit from this? Intel's job with respect to the personal computer market is twofold. The first is to build chips that enable system vendors to build more attractive products that will ultimately sell well in the market place. More performance is always a nice selling point, especially if it can be delivered in a compact form factor. The next is to add enough value to its chips that system vendors and customers find it worthwhile to buy products higher up in Intel's product stack. Intel may very well be able to charge meaningfully more for a Coffee Lake desktop chip with six processor cores and GT3e graphics than it currently can for a quad-core processor with just GT2 graphics. A boost in average selling prices, especially given that the personal-computer market itself isn't really growing, is a nice way for Intel to shore up its revenue here.

If the deal was made, it would shoot itself in the foot Ericsson strikes partnerships with Intel and Google for pay TV Ericsson said at IBC this week that it will partner Google to allow Android TV set tops to work with its MediaFirst TV Platform. It will also partner Intel to look for ways of bringing video processing more efficiently to the cloud. It has been re-engineering Microsoft’s Mediaroom since it acquired it three years ago, and many operator partners have felt their multiscreen needs were too urgent to wait around for the MediaFirst architecture to fully emerge and have deserted it. The integration of Ericsson MediaFirst TV Platform with Android TV will provide an additional pathway to extend MediaFirst cloud-based TV services, including 4K-UHD live TV channels, video-on-demand, catch-up TV and cloud DVR. When you talk to anyone in the pay TV-Ecosystem they say that they little reason to allow Android TV into it, because it allows a creeping influence of Google into the pay TV operators. But there are pay TV operators that talk differently and there have been some successful implementations around Android TV. The partnership will give operators the opportunity to benefit from Android TV's growing presence on connected TV operating systems, without the need for additional hardware costs. Operators will be able to partner with manufacturers of Android TV devices to deliver new hardware as well as niche OTT programming, or deploy additional applications within the Android operating system. Additionally, the collaboration will enable Ericsson to deliver multiple, flexible, pre-integrated set-tops which sup-port hybrid configurations for TV. In a separate blog and announcement Ericsson also said it would begin a collaboration with Intel which seemed to point more to encoding than anything else, although there was not much detail given. There were hints that Ericsson will perhaps give up its dedicated encoding chips and work with Intel on cloud infrastructure, not only for video processing, but also mobility and cloud infrastructure. Ericsson and Intel research centres will also explore joint innovation around video processing, which to us reads code for the Envivio team will get hints from Intel on how best to lay software encoding onto modern Intel cloud servers. The aim to build a foundation for a cloud-centric media infra-structure using virtualized media applications. Intel has plans to release Intel Xeon processors with integrated FPGAs ton accelerate the performance of a software-defined data centre. Also perhaps the Ericsson encoding chip the AVP4000 or some derivative of it could become one of those FPGAs which plug into Intel chips. That would be a mistake we feel, since the entire thrust of encoding has been to go software only and given new encoders coming down the track in the form of AOMedia, and others, its best to retain the constant flexibility of a software only approach. The two also said the combination of Ericsson’s HDS8000 Hyperscale data centre system and Intel Rack Scale Design will help to transform the media data centre by enabling a disaggregated hardware approach that will dramatically improve efficiency, utilization, automation and total cost of ownership. The potential media use cases for data centre workloads include media processing, media delivery and cloud DVR, enabling TV players to build trust in their service delivery while embracing new technologies at the same time. Ericsson and Intel will work together to enable agile service delivery, giving media players the opportunity to drive organisational flexibility and bring new and compelling services to market. For instance, Ericsson’s MediaFirst TV Platform and its native cloud and SaaS approach already leverage DevOps models for continuous development and deployment in live systems. Ericsson is adopting virtualized micro-service based applications in all of its solutions to give complete flexibility to deployment and operational models. Moving beyond the media experiences, Ericsson and Intel are already working together to accelerate the development of 5G-ready networks.

Photograph: David Sillitoe for the Guardian Dalya Alberge Monday 12 September 2016 02.00 EDT Last modified on Thursday 15 September 2016 18.16 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close This article is 2 months old The head of the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) may be more versed in the language of the Bard than computer chips, but a corporate technology video inspired him to see the potential of digital science, fibre optics and sensors for live theatre. Gregory Doran, the RSC’s artistic director, was overwhelmed by an extraordinary flying whale in a three-minute corporate video by Intel Corporation. The footage is spectacular. The whale swims across three juxtaposed cinema screens before emerging through one of them and swimming over hundreds of people in an auditorium. Referring to the technology, rather than the whale, Doran told colleagues: “That’s what I want for The Tempest.” Sounds and sweet airs: The Tempest's seductive musical sorcery Read more They contacted Intel, who were excited by the challenge of extending technology developed for film and video to live theatre. In November, the shipwreck, storms and fantastical creatures of Shakespeare’s late play will be brought to life with what promises to be spectacular special effects. Rehearsals begin on Monday. The production stars Simon Russell Beale as Prospero, the magician, and Mark Quartley as Ariel, the sprite, who will be transformed through real-time performance capture technology into a “live” animated character in the RSC Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon. Quartley will be on stage, wearing sensors that capture his movements, projecting them into the air and rendering him as a character that morphs in and out of a human form. Doran told the Guardian: “You will see an avatar of Ariel in real time, flying, walking and moving in the middle space, in the air. It will be projected on to a whole number of things. “I’m amazed just how fast technology advances. There’s even been, since we started this venture [a year ago], a new kind of glass that’s been invented that you can’t see. So there are all sorts of things that you can project on to.” The production combines the RSC’s traditional theatre-making skills and Intel’s digital innovation with the technical imagination of the Imaginarium Studios, in London, in pushing boundaries. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Gregory Doran on the technology in his new production of The Tempest Technological experiments will take place this week. The hope is that when Prospero conjures up a magical storm to wreck the ship carrying men who wronged him projected images on multiple surfaces will also make the audience feel as though they are in the ship as it starts filling with water. Actors will appear to be thrown into the air by crashing, swirling waves. Doran said: “There’s all the computer-generated extraordinary stuff you can do on film. But it has never yet been done live on stage. This is storytelling for the 21st century, taking the audience’s imagination into new realms. “We would be Luddites not to open ourselves to those possibilities.” Sarah Ellis, the RSC’s head of digital development, said: “To be able to create digital characters in real time on that scale in a theatrical environment is a huge achievement.” But Doran is keen to emphasise “the primacy of the words”. “The effects mustn’t overwhelm them … It’s got to enhance rather than dictate what we’re doing.” Tawny Schlieski, Intel’s director of research, said that the potential for live theatre is huge: “It’s not about being new for new’s sake. It’s about creating that moment in which you’re immersed in a world and you don’t think about why or how. You just become lost in it. That’s something magical.” They were speaking ahead of an announcement on Monday of the RSC’s spring/summer 2017 season. From Stratford to Shanghai: the Royal Shakespeare Company tours China Read more The programme will pay tribute to the Roman poet Ovid, a major influence on Shakespeare. A new Rome season of Shakespeare’s four great political thrillers will begin with Julius Caesar, with its somewhat topical “politics of spin and betrayal”, followed by Antony and Cleopatra, Titus Andronicus and Coriolanus. World premieres will include a co-production – with Hull Truck theatre and Hull City of Culture 2017 – of The Hypocrite by the award-winning playwright Richard Bean. It is described as a “riotous farce about the infamous moment in Hull’s history which started the English civil war”. Another first is a staging of a story of social injustice from 13th-century Yuan dynasty China. Guan Hanqing’s Snow in Midsummer – in a contemporary translation by the playwright Frances Ya-Chu Cowhig – tells the story of a young girl framed for a crime she did not commit. It is part of a cultural exchange with China. The Shanghai Dramatic Arts Centre will in turn produce Henry V with a Chinese cast under RSC associate director Owen Horsley. Whether new technology will feature in the 2017 season remains to be seen.

Presented in collaboration with MyGov, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeITY) and Hyderabad-based T-Hub Foundation, this year's challenge invites innovators makers across India to build solutions to accelerate the digitisation and commercially develop their prototypes on Intel Architecture (iA). "It is heartening to see public-private collaborations, such as the one between Intel India, MeITY, MyGov and T-Hub, driven towards building a long-term innovation culture in the nation," said Telangana Information and Technology Minister K.T. Rama Rao. This year, the challenge will roll out in five phases, with the final taking place in April 2017. Shortlisted teams will receive Rs 3 lakh grant each to create minimum-viable products (MVPs) based on Intel Architecture (iA) in an accelerator programme at the T-Hub incubator in Hyderabad. The winning team will get Rs 20 lakh to further their project development. "Last year, there were six ideas under the challenge that completed the mind-to-market journey, and are already making their solutions available in the Indian health care and agriculture sectors," added Gaurav Dwivedi, CEO, MyGov. The Intel India initiative aims to enable technology innovation in the country for students, entrepreneurs and other innovators. "Innovation is the key ingredient for making the Digital India vision a reality, and we need a local, sustainable innovation ecosystem, to address the country's challenges," said Debjani Ghosh, Managing Director and Vice President (Sales iamp; Marketing), Intel South Asia. "Through strong public-private collaboration, wherein MeITY, MyGov, T-Hub, and Intel India are working together to turn ideas to solutions, disruptive yet sustainable technology innovations are now a reality," she added. In its recent collaboration with NITI Aayog, Intel India is working to establish Atal Tinkering Laboratories (ATLs) for "mini makers" in 10 schools across the country. na/dg Previous News Next News News Categories World India Business Sports Bollywood Hollywood Kerala Education Health Technology Automobile Travel Computer Features BEST OF NK News Maps Travel India Info Games Education Self Help Recipes Names Astrology © Copyright 2016.

Chandrasekaran , Benzinga Staff Writer   {{following ? "Following" : "Follow"}} September 13, 2016 1:27pm   Comments Share: Related SYMC LifeLock Could Be 'Too Good An Opportunity' For Symantec To Pass Up Wall Street's M&A Chatter From November 14 Growth-Needy Cisco Aiming To Be Top Dog In Security Vs. Palo Alto (Investor's Business Daily) Wunderlich Securities thinks Symantec Corporation (NASDAQ: SYMC) has spent more money in the last few years on transforming itself to next-generation security provider. Earlier, the company was restricted to backup and bulky legacy security. Analysts Bill Choi and Ryan MacDonald believe the transformation could enable Symantec to offer updated solutions to different segments like web/cloud with the addition of Blue Coat Systems to the consumer and enterprises. As a result, the company would become strong to boost its market share inside the IT segment by consolidating its presence in the enterprise segment. As a result, the brokerage upgraded the stock from Hold to a Buy rating and boosted target price from $23 to $30.

In our opinion, Symantec significantly improved its position with the Blue Coat acquisition, which has good mix of web and cloud security," according to the research note. The brokerage sees stabilization in Symantec's core businesses based on the expectation of reaccelerated endpoint security business due to the integration of BlueCoat business. The lead analyst sees the company gaining in DLP and cyber security services due to Blue Coat. Wunderlich sees Symantec progressing well toward achieving its cost savings goal of $400 million pointing out that it has already achieved $50 million runrate in the last quarter. Analyst expects more than $150 million cost savings from Blue Coat amalgamation. At time of writing, Symantec was down 0.52 percent at $24.72. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

The chipmaker, which dominates in video gaming, rolled out graphics chips for running software that makes split-second decisions needed when everything from phones to cars to internet search engines respond to inputs such as speech, images and moving objects. The company said its new Tesla P4 chip is for servers used in massive data centers. Based on its Pascal design, the P4 is more than three times as efficient at processing images than its predecessor and 40 times more efficient than Intel server chips, according to Nvidia. Another new chip, called the P40, is designed for more-powerful single computers, such as supercomputers. Read more about artificial intelligence here. Nvidia is taking aim at its Santa Clara, California-based neighbor Intel Corp., which last month announced its own AI chips and talked about its ambition to muscle in on this nascent but fast-growing market. Both companies also want to ensure data center operators such as Google not only use their technology but aren’t tempted to design their own custom solutions.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter Nvidia has argued its graphics chips, which perform multiple small manipulations of data simultaneously, are the right answer for AI systems, and it has invested in software to make them easier to use. Intel has said its chips, which have less ability to work in parallel but are more capable in general purpose computing, offer the right solutions. Data center owners, whose biggest cost is energy, are focused on components that can get the job done using less power. It’s still early days in the market for AI chips. In its latest quarter, Nvidia’s data center business more than doubled sales to $151 million and most of this came from AI tasks. Intel’s data center unit had sales of $4 billion, but very little of that revenue came from AI projects. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Press Release: Panasonic introduces Automotive Mobile Test Solution to enhance vehicle system initialisation and production testing 1 by Surur  @mspoweruser Sep 13, 2016 at 14:00 GMT2 months ago BRACKNELL, UK. 13th September 2016:  Designed by Panasonic Global Design Solutions following close consultation with leading industry manufacturers, Panasonic has launched its next generation in-line testing solution for the automotive industry at Automechanika in Frankfurt, Germany. The Panasonic Automotive Mobile Test Solution (AMTS) combines the technology requested by the automotive industry for efficient vehicle production and initialisation with enterprise features for seamless integration into a corporate IT environment. Designed with user and processes in mind The device has been developed with both ease of use and automotive production processes at the forefront of the design. The AMTS, based on the market-leading fully rugged Panasonic Toughpad FZ-M1 tablet, incorporates a 7 inch capacitive multi-touchscreen display, an NFC contactless card reader, integrated high power infrared, and a 2D barcode reader which are situated within the specially designed handle of the AMTS which aids mobility in the production environment. The solution is designed to be positioned on the steering wheel or the dashboard of the vehicle being tested due to its interchangeable, protective mounting insert. The AMTS also includes four programmable hot keys for one-touch access to important applications and functionality. Specialised connectivity The AMTS is built with the connectivity requirements of the automotive manufacturers in mind with dual rugged connectors that allow USB communication plus protected ODB in-vehicle charging from a VCI device. This means that the solution is ergonomic for both left and right hand drive vehicles. The power for testing applications To meet the processing and efficiency requirements for automotive testing, the Panasonic AMTS is powered by the Intel® Core™ m5-6Y57 vPro processor (1.1GHz up to 2.8 GHz with Intel® Turbo Boost Technology and a 4MB Intel cache) and Intel® HD graphics. It comes with the latest Windows 10 Pro operating system, which can be downgraded to Windows 7 Professional. For storage there is a 128GB Solid State Drive with 256GB optional. For communications, the AMTS is equipped with Bluetooth™ v4.1+EDR Class 1 and an Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 8260 WLAN capability with optional 4G mobile broadband (Gobi 5000, compatible to 3G) connectivity. A decade of design history “Panasonic has near a decade of experience collaborating with some of the world’s leading automotive manufacturers to create rugged mobile devices designed for the industry’s requirements,” said Robert Blowers, Head of R&D and General Manager at Panasonic Computer Products Europe. “As a result of our relationship and collaborative approach with these manufacturers, The Automotive Mobile Test Solution is the next generation of mobile device to help deliver ever more efficient and cost effective vehicle production for our customers.” The Panasonic AMTS will be available from October 2016 and is priced from £3,490.

The latest chunk'o’change brings its total funding to $25.6m, and founder and CEO Sid Sijbrandij said the cash would be used to “accelerate development and adoption” of its products: “We want to be the first company to integrate and git-ify all the tools developers need.” GitLab sees the software development process into a 10-step cycle, from initial idea, through development, testing, etc to production. A 12-step programme would be more catchy, but we suppose they don’t actually want to cure anyone of developing software. CEO Sid Sijbrandij said each step or two steps constituted a potential discrete product, and the firm wanted to span collaboration across the entire cycle. The ultimate aim was a single super product, he continued. The firm has already integrated continuous integration into its platform. In August it shipped Issue Board. Its September release will target Deployment with spiced up Review functionality, and cycle analytics and an improved Slackbot to cover production are slated for later this year. At the same time, there are certain bounds to GitLab’s ambitions - or at least how much of customers’ existing setup it can reasonably expect to displace. “We recognise there’s more out there, so we want to to play nice with what companies already have.” “What’s outside our scope is the PAAS,” he said. “We won’t go into your production environments, we won’t do configuration.” Something else outside its scope is blowing cash on a fancy corporate HQ. While it’s a cliché that once firms start spending more time building their HQ than their products, they’re in trouble, Gitlab has no corporate HQ at all, and its 100-plus staff are spread around the world. Which means Sijbrandij is now based in San Francisco; he only shares his digs with his wife and cat. “We don’t have any location where two people work.” He admitted that this left some investors “sceptical” about the model, but insists, “When they saw the amazing people we were able to hire, that changed their mind.” ® Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 10 Comments More from The Register Think GitHub and Git but for data – and you've got FlockerHub and fli ClusterHQ debuts information time machine for better production testing 9 Comments New Year, new Git: Version control system updated this week Careful of flakiness when perusing this box of delights 7 Comments Git thee behind me, Git crit security bug!

The company is engaged in the design and manufacture of digital technology platforms with segments that include Client Computing, Data Center, Internet of Things, Software and Services, etc. The stock is bouncing off of support, and the technology dividend-payer should be popular among buyers following the Fed speech. Investors have repriced a much lower probability for higher interest rates than they had last week, which is good for INTC’s dividend and fundamental performance. We recommend maintaining a short-term outlook, but, for now, a repeat of the post-Brexit rally doesn’t seem an unlikely possibility. Buy to open the INTC October 36 Calls (INTC161021C00036000).

The most common one is using the system CPU to process audio, under a technique called HSP (Host Signal Processing), with the south bridge chip from the chipset providing the necessary interfacing circuit with the external world. The second way  which nowadays is only seen on few very high-end motherboards  is using a dedicated controller to control and process the audio and thus not using the system CPU for these tasks.  http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/how-o...audio-works/2/ Thus, the feature in Win10 dedicates a CPU core to handle the data to/from the motherboards codec chip. This is the work that is handled by external interfaces. As for synthesis, my bet is that people arent using audio fonts and the like much any longer. All of these plugins and stand along soft synths use the CPU directly; they are usually not accelerated by any dedicated device (unless you get into stuff like UAudio plugins).

I was going to upgrade the Fatal1ty Champion I have now but I think I'll wait for cards built with Win10 official support in mind.Not this current generation that has to play catch up with handicapped drivers because the hardware is now inadequate to handle Windows Audio Processing.I can only imagine what the prices would be like, now that they have to match Window's 32bit sample rates, f#$%n hell. The f*^&n OS added 32bit sample rates to my f#%^n card, literally taking complete control over it, rendering it's ability to alleviate cpu time useless.Thankfully we have people like PAX and DK to try and sort out the mess for us.God Bless them, but they can only do so much, this time around. I'm blazing furious about this.     Dragondale13 View Public Profile Find all posts by Dragondale13 « Previous Thread | Next Thread » Thread Tools Show Printable Version Email this Page Display Modes Linear Mode Switch to Hybrid Mode Switch to Threaded Mode Posting Rules You may not post new threads You may not post replies You may not post attachments You may not edit your posts BB code is On Smilies are On [IMG] code is On HTML code is Off Forum Rules Forum Jump User Control Panel Private Messages Subscriptions Who's Online Search Forums Forums Home General Chat     The Guru's Pub     Folding@Home - Join Team Guru3D !     Frontpage news     Digital Photography, Home and Portable Electronics     Tablets and Smart Phones     The HTPC, HDTV & Ultra High Definition section Videocards     Videocards - NVIDIA GeForce     Videocards - NVIDIA GeForce Drivers Section     Videocards - AMD Radeon     Videocards - AMD Radeon Catalyst Drivers Section     Videocards - 3dfx     Videocards vs General Purpose - NVIDIA Ageia PhysX, GPGPU etc.     3D Stereo Gaming Section     Benchmark Mayhem Hardware     General Hardware     Die-hard Overclocking & Case Modifications      Computer Monitor Forum     Soundcards, Speakers HiFI & File formats     SSD and HDD storage     Processors and motherboards AMD     Processors and motherboards Intel     Network questions and troubleshooting     Laptops & Notebooks Affiliates     Rivatuner Generic Discussion forum         RivaTuner Advanced Discussion forum     MSI AfterBurner Overclock Application Discussion forum     MSI AfterBurner Private Beta access     ATI Tray Tools         ATI Tray Tools Generic Discussion             ATI Tray Tools Public Beta Section     Guru of 3D Clan General     Games, Gaming & Game-demos     Game Tweaks and Modifications     Consoles & console games     Operating Systems     General Software and Applications     Hardware Reviews and News     Programming/Html     Links Powered by vBulletin® Copyright ©2000 - 2016, Jelsoft Enterprises Ltd. vBulletin Skin developed by: vBStyles.com Copyright (c) 1995-2014, All Rights Reserved.

By: Steven Bassiri | Gaming Laptops in Laptops | Posted: Sep 12, 2016 10:10 pm Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA TweakTown Rating: 92%Manufacturer: ASUS Page 1 [Introduction, Specifications, and Pricing] Page 1 [Introduction, Specifications, and Pricing] Page 2 [Physical Overview] Page 3 [Physical Overview Continued] Page 4 [Software and BIOS] Page 5 [System Performance Benchmarks] Page 6 [Gaming Performance Benchmarks] Page 7 [System IO and Battery Performance] Page 8 [Thermal Performance] Page 9 [What's Hot, What's Not & Final Thoughts] Introduction     At Skylake launch, Intel introduced two new mobile processor lines; mobile Xeons and overclockable mobile processors. Today, I take a look at ASUS's G701 gaming notebook equipped with an overclockable mobile Core i7 CPU, the i7 6820HK. Now, for a notebook to be considered a gaming product, it must also carry a discrete graphics processor. In the case of the G701, a NVIDIA GTX 980M is used. While it is true that the 980M is no longer king since the launch of the GTX 1000 series mobile graphics processors, this notebook is still very capable of rendering high frame rates at a slightly lower cost since the GTX 980M is no longer NVIDIA's most powerful mobile GPU.     The G701 is a 17" notebook, and while I have reviewed a lot of 17" notebooks, this is the first one that uses an FHD (1920x1080) panel instead of a UHD (3840x2160) panel. While some might consider that a negative, I do not consider it as a weakness. In fact, a 17" panel is not that big, and 1080p is more than enough pixels to produce a worthwhile gaming experience. The G701 I am looking at today is equipped with a 1TB RAID 0 array based on two 512GB Samsung SM951 M.2 x4 PCI-E 3.0 SSDs. The super-fast storage coupled with the overclockable mobile processor and high-end mobile gaming GPU should produce a very powerful mobile gaming system. Let's take a look.     Specifications     Like most notebooks, the G701 comes in many different configurations. However, they will all use the i7-6820HK processor with 4 cores and 8 threads. The processor runs at 2.7GHz base frequency with a 3.6GHz Turbo, and 3.8GHz if you overclock it. Our unit uses a GTX 980M with 8GB of VRAM, two 512GB Samsung SM951 M.2 SSDs in RAID 0, and an Intel dual-band Wireless-AC 7265 Wireless AC and Bluetooth card. The panel is a 17.3" LED FHD (1920 x 1080) anti-glare panel with 72% NTSC with wide view technology. The notebook is a little heavy at 7.9lbs. It's also not small at 17x12x13" (WxDxH).     The CPUz screens show our unit with an overclock. The overclock was configured through ASUS's software in Windows and applied upon reboot. Our G701 has an immense 64GB of DDR4 running at 2400MHz. The unit also has Thunderbolt 3, a refined audio DAC, and a 6-cell 93 Whrs battery. To power all of this, ASUS provides a 230W power adapter.     Pricing   The G701 comes in many different forms; ours costs roughly $3200. The price should drop as the GTX 1000M series mobile GPUs become more widespread.

InFocus MondoPad 70-inch all-in-one has Intel's Skylake processors and is designed for collaboration and videoconferencing. Credit: InFocus More like this Microsoft spices up Surface Hub with Azure cloud services Microsoft and IBM in a deal to push Surface devices to enterprises Review: 4 mini-PCs give you full power in a very small package Video Mingis on Tech: From superfast SSDs to Bluetooth locks and solar shingles Competition is good, and InFocus' huge MondoPad Ultra all-in-one PC highlights some shortcomings in Microsoft's Surface Hub touchscreen computers. MondoPad and Surface Hub lead a unique class of all-in-one computers with large screens that are being used in classrooms and conference rooms for video conferencing, collaboration and whiteboarding.  The MondoPad Ultra is a computer built into a 70-inch screen. At $13,999, its price sits between Microsoft's two Surface Hubs, the $8,999 55-inch model and the $21,999 84-inch model. InFocus believes the MondoPad Ultra provides more bang for the buck than Surface Hub. The MondoPad has a 4K screen, which is also featured in the 84-inch Surface Hub. The 55-inch Surface Hub has a full HD screen. Some features give the MondoPad Ultra a performance advantage. It has a 6th Generation Intel Core i7-6700T processor code-named Skylake, which is much faster than the Surface Hubs' aging 4th Generation Intel processors code-named Haswell, introduced in 2013. With new processors come faster processing power and better graphics. InFocus didn't immediately reveal if MondoPad Ultra had a discrete GPU. The 55-inch Surface Hub has integrated Intel Haswell graphics, and the 84-inch model has Nvidia's Quadro K2200 discrete GPU, which is about two years old. InFocus' MondoPad has 256GB of storage, double that of Surface Hub. Both computers have 8GB of memory. There's no significant difference between the MondoPad and Surface Hub on display ports, USB and connectivity features. Microsoft didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on whether it plans to upgrade the Surface Hub, which started shipping earlier this year. But the Surface Hub has some inherent advantages over competing devices like MondoPad. In computers like these, multi-touch capabilities matter because they define the number of users who can draw or write on the screen at the same time. The MondoPad has a 16-point touch capability, which doesn't match Surface Hubs' 100-point touch capability. MondoPad comes with Windows 10 Pro, while Microsoft's Surface Hub has a custom version of Windows 10 with unique apps, editing, annotation and collaboration features. Surface Hub ships with Surface Pen styluses, and it is not clear if pens will ship with MondoPad Ultra. InFocus says Apple devices and Chromebooks can project content to the MondoPad Ultra. The MondoPad Ultra 70-inch computer will ship in October. InFocus already offers 80-inch and 85-inch MondoPad Ultra products.

Two Power8 CPUs (silver) are integrated with four Nvidia Tesla P100 Pascal GPUs (copper) via Nvidia's NVLink interconnect (Photo: IBM) Asia-Pacific, Big Data, Blades, Featured, HPC, IBM IBM: Tencent to Run OpenPower Servers in Its Data Centers by Yevgeniy Sverdlik  on September 9, 2016 Add Your Comments Tweet Tencent, China’s answer to Facebook which this week became the country’s most valuable publicly traded company, is integrating new servers powered by OpenPower, IBM’s alternative to Intel’s ubiquitous x86 chip architecture, into its hyperscale data centers. That’s according to IBM. Yesterday, the company rolled out a new OpenPower chip and three new OpenPower servers, including the one being deployed at Tencent data centers to run Big Data workloads. OpenPower is at the center of IBM’s current server play, focused on high-horsepower workloads as opposed to the general-purpose x86 market the company got out of in 2014 when it sold its commodity server business to Lenovo. OpenPower is a chip architecture developed through a foundation whose members include Google, Nvidia, and Broadcom, among many others. Unlike x86, which Intel keeps exclusive to itself, IBM licenses OpenPower to other companies wishing to build chips using the architecture. Tencent, according to IBM, recently tested a large cluster of its new servers, finding that they performed three times faster than the x86-based infrastructure it had in place, with fewer servers. The announcement didn’t specify, however, what kind of x86 servers the cluster was compared to and how old they were. The results were convincing enough for Tencent to go ahead with a production deployment of the IBM servers, but it’s unclear how big that deployment will be. According to IBM, the Chinese company is “integrating the new servers into its hyperscale data centers for big data workloads.” Social networking giant Tencent drives revenue growth through advertising and gaming on its messaging apps WeChat and QQ. On Monday, when its shares rose 4.2 percent, the company’s market value reached $256.6 billion, surpassing China Mobile as the most valuable company in China and joining the likes of Apple and Alphabet on the list of 10 largest public companies in the world. If the scale of Tencent’s deployment is significant, it should be concerning for Intel, whose x86 architecture has dominated the data center market for years with little trouble from challengers. Other two hyperscale data center operators, Google and Rackspace, have been co-designing a server based on IBM’s Power9 CPU, with plans to open source the server architecture through the Open Compute Project. Founded by Facebook, OCP has become the primary hub for open source hardware design for hyperscale data centers. IBM announced Power9 last month, but systems based on these 14nm chips are not expected to ship until sometime in 2017. Internet giants like Tencent, Google, and Facebook, which operate some of the world’s largest data centers, are now the primary growth drivers for suppliers in the data center hardware food chain, and emergence of a serious challenger to Intel in this space would threaten to slow the chip giant’s future revenue gains. And OpenPower isn’t the only challenger that’s gathering up steam. At the high end of the data center market, Intel is also being challenged by Nvidia. Much of the computing might in IBM’s new Linux servers comes from integration with Nvidia GPUs, working in tandem with OpenPower CPUs as accelerators. The most powerful of the three new models comes with the GPU maker’s latest and greatest interconnect technology, NVLink, which links the new Power8 processor to Tesla P100 Pascal GPUs. Bill Boday, IBM’s senior offering manager for Linux on Power, said Power8 is the “first CPU designed for acceleration,” meaning acceleration via GPUs, while NVLink provides five times the bandwidth of PCIe interconnects. Nvidia’s latest Pascal processors also power its first supercomputer, DGX-1. The chipmaker recently gifted a DGX-1 system to OpenAI, the artificial-intelligence research non-profit founded by Elon Musk. Read more: Why Nvidia Gave Elon Musk’s AI Non-Profit a Supercomputer The IBM system with NVLink is S822LC for High Performance Computing. It has two Power8 CPUs, tightly integrated with four Tesla P100 GPUs via NVLink. The other two systems (S822LC for Big Data and S821C) are compatible with Nvidia GPUs but interconnection with CPUs is done via PCIe ports. Intel’s answer to high-octane, GPU-accelerated computing is Xeon Phi. The next-gen part in this line (Knights Mill) – its first designed specifically with machine learning in mind – is expected to ship next year.

Facebook Google Investing Analyst Upgrades Bankruptcy Buffett Corporate Governance Corporate Performance Dividends and Buybacks Earnings ETFs and Mutual Funds International Markets IPOs and Secondaries Mergers and Acquisitions Personal Finance Rumors Value Investing Economy Energy Government Regulation Healthcare Housing Jobs Special Report Brands and Products Cities Countries States Despite Volatility, Symantec Gets More Positive Analyst Views By Jon C. Ogg September 13, 2016 3:33 pm EST Print Email Tweet Is it possible that this is time that Symantec Corporation (NASDAQ: SYMC) is finally going to rocket higher? Symantec is now back to being security focused and the Blue Coat acquisition is going to make that even more of the case. The difference here is that it opens up more data security efforts for Symantec. After an analyst upgraded Symantec on Tuesday (9/13), we wanted to take a look at other analyst calls of late. It turns out that the bias has been leaning higher. Tuesday’s call was from Wunderlich, with the firm raising its rating to Buy from Hold. It also set a price target all the way up at $30.00 on Symantec — which is $1.00 higher than the prior street high target price. Before getting into individual analyst calls made of late, the Thomson Reuters consensus price target should say it all. The current consensus analyst target (mean) is $24.31. That consensus price target was $23.28 a month ago, $20.77 two months ago, and it was all the way down at $19.47 just three months ago. BTIG recently kept a Buy rating and $28.00 price target. The firm’s weekend software summary said: We continue to believe that $2.00 EPS by Fiscal Year 2019 is achievable, and think that Symantec’s stock should continue to re-rate as investors get more comfortable with the extent and impact of the combined $550 million in cost savings. BTIG expects linearity in Blue Coat integration costs, but they still expect more than 600 basis points of margin expansion from Fiscal Year 2016 to Fiscal Year 2018. That will come from targeting efficiencies in procurement, back office operations and real estate. BTIG even sees numerous scenarios boosting revenues for the new Symantec. Barclays, back on September 7, said that a McAfee sale with Intel and TPG combined might create a more focused competitor (MacAfee and Norton dominate PC markets). They had a mere Equal Weight rating with a $24.00 price target. Barclays said: We think spinning McAfee out as an independent company could create a more focused competitor to Symantec. Recall, Intel acquired McAfee in 2010 and part of the vision was to bring security down closer to the chip level. The market did not evolve towards that, and at the same time the broader endpoint market started to see more competition from freemium vendors. By spinning out, McAfee might be able to sharpen its focus in security, allowing it to attract more talent and potentially become a more focused security competitor to Symantec. It was also just on September 6 that 24/7 Wall St. pointed out the chart being so strong that chart watchers and investors might be ignoring the underlying fundamental valuations based upon hopes ahead. Even back in August, Citigroup raised Symantec’s rating to Buy from Neutral, and its price target was $26.50 (versus a prior close of $23.11 at that time).  Also in August, Symantec was started with a Buy rating and was given a $26 price target (versus a prior $22.54 close) at Goldman Sachs. One report that was not positive came from Standard & Poor’s on September 10. It kept a “Sell” rating and they have a mere price target of $20.00. Their ‘risk assessment’ said: Our risk assessment for Symantec reflects uncertain demand for the company’s products, the highly competitive market in which it operates and execution risks. This is balanced by the company’s solid market position and the growing number of cyber security threats. So far the analysts keep pointing higher on Symantec, at least for the most part. The shares have pulled back during the latest market sell-off, down almost 1% at $24.62 on Tuesday. Symantec’s 52-week trading range is $16.14 to $25.19. By Jon C.

"Cyberspace and the relationship that Russia has with the rest of the world: These are areas where we have had equilibriums in the past, but that equilibrium eludes us right now," Lettre told a public meeting at the Atlantic Council. Lettre admitted that US policymakers were now unsure whether the traditional forms of deterrence that the United States and its NATO allies use would continue to deter Russia. "What are the norms of deterrence?… These are areas in flux… These are important strategic questions to get right for US strategic security," he said. Lettre also noted that the United States and its allies faced the challenge of "hybrid warfare," together with challenges to the credibility of the US government and allied accounts as well as official narratives on international affairs from other states, including Russia. He also said that US intelligence services are still suffering significant problems in recruiting enough experts with detailed knowledge of and language capabilities for key parts of the world. "[There is] a real deficit in the deep regional expertize and language skills on hand," letter told an open meeting at the Atlantic Council. "On linguistic capabilities… we always seem to be deficient." Lettre also warned that US technical advantages in war and intelligence were fragile and could be eroded in the coming years. "We have valued tremendously our geospatial and signals intelligence collection those have been very valuable… However we are at risk of those capabilities degrading over time," he stated. Lettre, however, added that cooperation between the 17 main US intelligence agencies and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had greatly improved in the 15 years since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. He noted the agencies were now working seamlessly together.   ...

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Notebooks Tim Cook Responds to Email Saying He Is Committed to the Mac – We Should Stay Tuned By Omar Sohail Posted 2 months ago 30Shares Share Tweet Submit The fact that Tim Cook didn’t announce any product related to the Mac lineup would give consumers second thoughts of the company’s commitment towards its desktop and notebook lineup. However, the CEO has ensured that he and the company has not given up on the lineup. Tim Cook States to Stay Tuned for the Arrival of the New Mac Series We understand that the iPhone is the bread and butter of the company’s revenue stream, but that still does not allow the tech giant to not give us a proper explanation as to why Tim Cook didn’t make any announcement related to new Mac products. According to a responded email, Cook states that we should stay tuned for new products, which means that the refreshed lineup could appear later this year. However, with less than 4 months remaining, Apple is definitely running out of time. Intel has already announced its Kaby Lake series of processors, and the latest report suggests that the upcoming iMac and MacBook is not going to be powered by the aforementioned processors. Instead, they will be running Skylake processors, which are not bad any means, but if the company is going to be charging a fortune for these products, then they should at least incorporate them with the latest hardware. It is said that the upcoming Mac family is going to feature AMD GPUs based on the company’s Polaris architecture, but it hasn’t been specified which chips are going to present inside the different categories of machines. What we do know is that Type-C USB ports are going to be an addition, and Apple’s upcoming MacBook is also said to feature OLED display strip to replace the function keys that you find on regular notebooks. Advertisement Unfortunately, there is no official release date of these notebooks, so we will have to continue waiting patiently till such an update is delivered to us.

Nearly every major tech company, car company and ride services company, it seems, is developing or partnering with developers of self-driving technology, from Google parent Alphabet Inc to Tesla Motors, General Motors Corp and Uber Technologies Inc, creating an insatiable demand for the people teaching the machines to think. In about a year's time, a Lincoln sedan will be driving itself from Mountain View to San Francisco, using software developed by 250 or so students enrolled at education start-up Udacity, if all goes according to plan. Udacity bought the Lincoln already equipped with the digital interface needed in autonomous vehicles; students will write the code. Udacity's course, which costs $2,400 for three, 12-week terms, starts next month and was designed by company co-founder Sebastian Thrun, who launched Google's driverless car program. Self-driving truck startup Otto, recently acquired by Uber Technologies Inc, automaker Mercedes-Benz and chip maker Nvidia Corp contributed to Udacity's curriculum. "If you go through this curriculum you are on the bleeding edge of self-driving cars," said Thrun. FAST-TRACK TO JOBS? The aim of the program is a faster path to employment, Thrun said, in a career that has an average salary of $138,000. Mercedes-Benz, Chinese ride-service Didi Chuxing and others agreed to consider Udacity graduates for job openings. The employer pool is growing quickly. Research firm and venture capital database CB Insights has identified 33 corporations working on autonomous cars, including auto makers GM and Volvo, internet giants Baidu and Google, and Silicon Valley companies tech firm Intel and startup ride-service Lyft. GM for one is hiring dozens of engineers in the area, and Uber is looking to fill more than 50 positions in Pittsburgh, where the company is building a fleet of self-driving cars, according to jobs website Glassdoor. "I love people with MIT and Stanford degrees," Thrun said. But "there are a lot of people who can't make it to those institutions. There are entire generations of people who are equally smart and equally capable." Yet the idea that a certificate from an online training program would secure a job in one of the most difficult emerging technologies strikes some recruiters as very unlikely. A master's degree in computer science from a leading university such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology or Stanford University is the usual, and still preferred, course. "You'd be hard-pressed to say the Udacity candidate is going to be more qualified because they have some specific knowledge about self-driving cars, versus someone who has a rock-hard degree in computer science or data science," said Dave Carvajal, chief executive of recruiting firm Dave Partners, which fills executive jobs at venture-backed tech companies. HUNGRY FOR TALENT With a scarcity of talent in the workforce, companies have been recruiting directly from universities with strong programs in data science, robotics and machine learning. Carnegie Mellon University suffered an exodus of staff last year after Uber hired away 40 faculty and researchers for its Advanced Technologies Center. Startups, too, are sparring to build autonomous vehicle staff. Varden Labs, a company of fewer than 15 people working on self-driving car technology, is "hiring aggressively" although the field is "very competitive," said co-founder Alex Rodrigues. Technology companies frequently bemoan their struggle to hire qualified engineers, but the challenge is more pronounced in autonomous vehicles, which combines complex technologies such as machine learning and computer vision, and applies them to cars. Startups in particular are struggling to hire against powerhouses such as Apple Inc and Google, say recruiters. "The startups will have to get by with one, two, three or four people who can do it," said Dan Portillo, talent partner at venture firm Greylock Partners. But a small team may be enough for startup success. GM in March purchased Cruise Automation, a three-year-old autonomous vehicle startup with about 40 employees, for about $1 billion. Uber last month agreed to buy Otto, which is less than a year old, in a deal valued at $680 million. "Early hires are making unbelievable amounts of money in a few short years," Rodrigues said.

MSI's X99A Gaming Pro Carbon isn't their top of the line X99-refresh motherboard, but it does carry many of MSI's latest features and aesthetic enhancements. Like MSI's king, the X99A GODLIKE GAMING CARBON, the X99A Gaming Pro Carbon features carbon fiber themed heat sinks and RGB LEDs to illuminate the motherboard exactly to your liking.     While everyone agrees that RGB LEDs are now everywhere, their implementation varies considerably depending on the make and model of the product. MSI's original X99A GODLIKE GAMING was ahead of its time in regards to RGB LEDs and independent zone control, something that the X99A Gaming Pro Carbon has inherited. Apart from the RGB LEDs on the motherboard, MSI has also added in x4 PCI-E 3.0 M.2 and U.2 ports to support the latest in storage devices. Without further ado, let's take a look at MSI's X99A Gaming Pro Carbon.     Specifications     Apart from all the expected features such as quad-channel memory and 4-way SLI/CrossFireX support, the X99A Gaming Pro Carbon also carries USB 3.1 type-A and type-C, and USB 3.0 type-C (called USB 3.1 gen 1). Also included is x4 PCI-E 3.0 M.2, x4 PCI-E 3.0 U.2, upgraded audio, overclocking features, and an Intel NIC.     Pricing   The X99A Gaming Pro Carbon is available from many large retailers for $329.99.

The popular hyper-realistic video game can aid computers in piecing together a perception of the real world, according to MIT Technology Review . Researchers from Intel Labs and Darmstadt University, Germany, have extracted training data from the game, teaching algorithms to identify cars, pedestrians and other objects. The team developed and built a layer of software which acted as a buffer between the game and a computer's hardware to label the various components. Google driverless car model (Photo: PA) The game is an efficient way to teach algorithms, as recording and labelling real-life imagery by humans would be extremely laborious and virtually impossible. Given the wide variety of scenarios possible in the game, using it removes the need to recreate high-speed car crashes and other dangerous situations. Read More How much driverless cars could save on your motor insurance revealed “Annotating real-world data is an expensive operation and the current approaches do not scale up easily,” said Alizera Shafaei. A PhD student at the University of British Columbia, Mr Shafaei recently co-wrote a research paper detailing how computer games can be used to train computer vision systems. GTA V clip shows a woman struggling to manoeuvre her car “With artificial environments we can effortlessly gather precisely annotated data at a larger scale with a considerable amount of variation in lighting and climate settings,” he added. “We showed that this synthetic data is almost as good, or sometimes even better, than using real data for training.” Earlier this year, programmer Brett Watanabe created an immortal deer to wander through the streets of GTA V causing chaos. The animal quickly garnered a five-star 'wanted' rating for bad behaviour, and survived encounters in the game's military base and with violent gangs.

"I think his appointment a very good, neutrally well-politically placed position, which allows Europe to feel in the post-Brexit wake that they are not losing a connect with our intelligence instruments or with our collaboration and assistance which is critical, because ultimately well all face the same threats. The more join-up and support that we can lend to our European cousins, the better," Will Geddes, a UK security expert with ICP Group told Sputnik. © AP Photo/ Christian Alminana Greater EU Intel Sharing in Face of Daesh Threat 'Complicated' - ExpertBritish intelligence — because of its long history of dealing with the IRA and other groups in Northern Ireland, plus its experience of the 7/7 London bombings in 2005 — is deemed to be the best in the world and recent terror attacks on mainland Europe have exposed intelligence failures within the EU.  The joined-up communication and intel-sharing in the UK is in sharp contrast to the federalized and silo nature of many EU countries, which security experts say led to terrorists going untracked ahead of recent terrorist attacks in Europe. "British intelligence networks — particularly the join-up between MI5 [domestic intelligence agency] and MI6 [foreign] in addition to the join-up between the various police agencies is a template admired by many across the world in terms of how they have set up their intelligence infrastructures. Are we the best in the world? Well, yes. Between us and the United States, we have the most admirable systems," Geddes told Sputnik. Security Experience King — who was most recently Britain's ambassador to France — has worked on European defense and NATO issues, spent time in Brussels, working on relations with Turkey, European defense and EU enlargement and was UK Permanent Representative to the EU Political and Security Committee in Brussels, covering Common Foreign and Security Policy. Thank you. Looking forward to further discussions on this vitally important area. https://t.co/O75tZdFALy — Julian King (@JulianKingFCO) 2 August 2016 ​King's appointment has yet to be ratified, but he appeared before MEPs for a three-hour grilling, during which he said: "I have direct experience — not least from my time in the Political and Security Committee and on the ground in Ireland and Northern Ireland, and more recently in France. Two months ago, I was in Nice on the morning of 15 July and saw for myself the devastating aftermath of the attack the night before — which killed so many people, injured many more and traumatized Europe. It brought home to me again the true human cost of terrorism." NEWS: Strong performance by Commissioner-designate @JulianKingFCO. View of @TimKirkhopeMEPhttps://t.co/Mxak6pF9OS pic.twitter.com/EUYvy2Spwl — ECR Group (@ecrgroup) 12 September 2016 ​After appearing before MEPs, September 12, Timothy Kirkhope, group leader of the Conservatives and Reformists said: "It's clear that being the UK Commissioner will not be a walk in the park, but Sir Julian was right to say that the UK has played, and will continue to play, a major role in European security and intelligence cooperation even after we leave the EU." ...

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Extreme Samsung may be in talks with AMD, Nvidia to license graphics IP Samsung may be in talks with AMD, Nvidia to license graphics IP By Joel Hruska on September 13, 2016 at 7:30 am Comment Samsung and Apple are the two titans of the smartphone industry, but they’ve taken very different routes to get there. Where Apple has invested a great deal of time and money into building its own custom SoCs and designing its own microarchitecture, Samsung has historically used cores from many other companies, including Texas Instruments and Qualcomm. Last year, the company announced it would bring its first custom CPU core to market in 2016. Now, it’s reportedly in talks with both AMD and Nvidia, looking for a graphics core to match its custom CPU. We’ve heard rumors of Samsung wanting a custom GPU core before, but nothing concrete has come of it thus far. It’s hard to find good data on recent smartphone GPU market share, but this graph by Jon Peddie Research shows the lay of the land from two years ago. Given that Intel and Vivante are both out of the game (Vivante seems to have pivoted to focus on embedded and IoT), the major players here are Imagination Technologies (Apple’s preferred partner) and Qualcomm. Both Nvidia and AMD have graphics IP that Samsung could license — the key question is, is Samsung just looking to cut a deal that gives them access to certain patents so they can legally roll their own solution, or do they want a part that’s designed by either AMD or Nvidia? It’s not actually clear which company would be the better fit. Nvidia manufacturers one of the best Android tablets you can buy, but recently canceled its plans to upgrade the Shield tablet. It’s been speculated that this might have been due to pressure from Nintendo and its upcoming NX. Nvidia is believed to have won that design and may have been prevented from bringing a competitor product to market. Over the last few years Nvidia has focused much more on automotive and deep learning than on launching mobile products. AMD famously sold its mobile IP to Qualcomm, who created Adreno. There’s no reason Team Red couldn’t build a new low-power GPU, and the company’s focus on embedded and semicustom design makes it a good fit for Samsung. CEO Lisa Su has also talked about wanting to lean more on AMD’s patent portfolio while building out additional semi-custom wins. The question is whether AMD has the manpower or current resources to design something in-house. GCN isn’t known for being a low-power GPU architecture, after all, and AMD already has plenty to keep it busy with Microsoft’s Scorpio, Vega, and Zen all dropping in 2017. Speaking of Samsung’s M1, Anandtech got a look at the architecture during Hot Chips 2016. The chip is an out-of-order design capable of decoding four instructions per cycle and with a perceptron-based branch predictor. This last isn’t a brand-new feature, but companies are often cagey about the exact details of how they implement branch prediction in silicon. Above, we see Samsung’s M1 performance as compared with a Cortex-A57, albeit one clocked 200MHz below the Samsung chip. Performance is fairly good, even if the chip really only distinguishes itself in a few tests. As a first effort, it’s a solid core. If Samsung wants to pair it with a GPU of their own design, AMD and Nvidia are the companies to talk to. It could take several years to bring a new solution to market. But if Samsung wants Apple-like control over its own product lines, creating new GPU and CPU IP is the way to do it.

Subscribe to Ubergizmo on Youtube In the past, some have argued that games such as Rockstar’s Grand Theft Auto (GTA) franchise have promoted violence. However there have been instances where it has been found that it actually yielded some positive results, and it seems that over in Germany, researchers from Darmstadt University and Intel Labs have actually used the game to help teach self-driving cars how to navigate better in real life. According to the researchers, while machine learning might be a preferred way of teaching computers do certain things, the amount of data required is immense, and sometimes data can be hard to come by, which is why the researchers have turned to video games like GTA in which information such as roads and obstacles and objects can be used to substitute their real life versions. In some cases they claim that data from games is “almost as good, or sometimes even better”. What the researchers have done is create a software that can identify objects within GTA’s world, such as different objects and roads, and based on that they can use that information to teach self-driving cars the difference between pedestrians and other objects while driving. As to whether or not this method of teaching cars how to drive themselves will prove to be the most effective/efficient, it is a rather interesting approach. Filed in Transportation.

The MacBook Pro is now expected to be announced at a different event along with the iPad in October, according to many reports. The release date will follow the Apple event in a similar fashion to the iPhone 7 event, which also displayed the new iWatch series 2 and the controversial wireless ear pods. MacBook Pro needs a new update. The last version was released in 2012, and there have been no significant updates since then. The MacBook got updated with Intel’s Skylake processors and a new rose gold color option in 2016. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SN7gsMVB1yk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> The most prominent rumor surrounds the release of the MacBook Pro is a radical change in design. Similar to the 12-inch MacBook, it will be thinner and lighter. 6 MacBook Pro Rumors That Are Totally Teasing Us | POPSUGAR Tech https://t.co/zcju8Eob0G #MacBook #tech — byLenaDawn (@byLenaDawn) September 2, 2016 There are rumors of a gold edition, but this has not been confirmed. The new laptop is also expected to feature Touch ID and an OLED touchscreen bar on the keyboard to replace the top of the keyboard. The Touch ID means that you will probably be able to log in to the laptop with your fingerprint. An upgraded graphic card from either AMD and nVidia could make its way to the MacBook in 2016. The Skylake processor, a sixth-generation chip by Intel, is rumored to make its first appearance on the MacBook. This is expected to boost the speed of the MacBook and extend the machine’s battery life. @FinnInNY Hopefully next month. https://t.co/sbLTfOuFUI — MacRumors.com (@MacRumors) September 8, 2016 Since Apple is moving in the direction of wireless earphones, it is expected that the new MacBook pro will not feature a headphone jack. Earlier this year, the Daring Fireball alluded that the next MacBook may come with lighting ports: “Will MacBooks ship with a Lightning port in lieu of a headphone jack? If so, will they ship with headphones? (Probably not, I say. Cough up the extra $29 for a new pair of Apple EarPods),” Gruber explained. “Is this why we haven’t seen new MacBook Pros yet — because they’re waiting for the new iPhone so that both can go Lightning-for-audio at the same time? Perhaps.” Apple will want all their products to connect from the iPhone to iWatch to MacBook in their technological ecosystem. Therefore, it makes sense for iPhone 7 customers to be able to use their ear pods with their future MacBook pro. According to Mac Rumors, Apple may be working on a 5k display for the MacBook Pro. “Apple’s plans to work with LG on a standalone 5K display surface two months after it discontinued the five-year-old Thunderbolt Display. It remains unclear if the monitor will be based upon the Retina 5K iMac, and it is also unclear if the report’s broad late 2016 timeframe for ‘some of the new Mac products’ includes the display.” I guess the rumors about a new #MacBook Pro are real. the site won't let you purchase a new one. #AppleEvent pic.twitter.com/prFfUbnbI5 — ohthanksgee (@ohthanksgee) September 7, 2016 The MacBook Pro 2016 keyboard is expected to feature the butterfly mechanism rather than the traditional scissor mechanism. The current MacBook Pro range starts at $1,099 for the 13-inch non-Retina model, rising to $1,119 for the entry-level 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro and topping out at $2,099 for the 2.5GHz 15-inch Retina. The MacBook Pro 2016 prices are expected to be the same or at least similar, starting at $1,099. Some of the wild MacBook rumors include a touchscreen and a detachable keyboard. Touch sensitive keys rather than a physical keyboard has been thrown out there but is very unlikely at this point. Most laptops released this year has surpassed the MacBook Pro because its current version is dated. Apple will be looking to impress when the new MacBook Pro series is released.

Reuters/Lucy Nicholson Fresh reports suggest that the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 launch will be delayed. The company may make the highly-anticipated device available in 2017. After the resounding success of Microsoft Surface Pro 4, the Surface Pro 5 is eagerly awaited by fans. The release date delay rumours may not upset fans as a 2017 launch opens up the possibility of Microsoft including the Intel Kaby Lake processor in the Surface Pro 5 device. Even though Microsoft is yet to release any information, there are multiple indications suggesting the Kaby Lake processor will run the show for Microsoft Surface Pro 5. The Kaby Lake processors won’t be ready until end of this year and hence cannot be shipped to the Surface team now. This could be the primary reason for the delay in the launch of Microsoft Surface Pro 5. Furthermore, the device will have the updated Windows 10. The Redstone 2 update is not arriving till spring of 2017, writes iTechPost. All this point towards a 2017 release for Microsoft Surface Pro 5. Microsoft is expected to hold a hardware launch event in late October. However, Microsoft may not be announcing anything on Surface Pro 5 in that event. Instead, Microsoft would be looking to “refresh” its Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book devices. There will be minor changes and a processor update, writes Neowin. Nonetheless, fans believe Microsoft will reveal something about Surface Pro 5 during that event. Meanwhile, the Microsoft Surface Phone 2016 is rumoured to have a Carl Zeiss lens in its 21MP rear camera and 8MP front camera, which will also sport a triple-LED flash. The USB Type-C port will also be made available for lightning speed data transfer and rapid charging.

News & Analysis Chip Process War Heats Up Samsung and China are the wild cards Rick Merritt 9/12/2016 09:00 PM EDT Post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet SAN JOSE, Calif. — Although volumes are still small, fully depleted silicon-on-insulator could grow rapidly in the wake of Globalfoundries’ plans for a 12nm process. Whether Samsung or a new fab coming up in Shanghai will adopt FD-SOI will be a big factor, said veteran market watcher Handel Jones of International Business Strategies. Ironically in a semiconductor industry traditionally focused on the next big thing, the aging 28nm node is likely to be the biggest process off all through 2025, according to the current IBS forecast. The FinFET processes adopted by top chip makers Intel, Samsung and TSMC provide the highest performance and lowest power consumption. However in a 14nm equivalent, FD-SOI supports 16.8% lower cost per gate than FinFETs, Jones said. It also provides about 25% lower design cost and risk of needing a re-spin, he added. In addition, FD-SOI has a unique ability to dynamically manage power consumption through biasing. The process also delivers superior support for RF given a significantly higher cut-off frequency than FinFETs, said Jones who attended last week’s FD-SOI event in Shanghai. FD-SOI sports a 16.8% lower wafer cost at 14nm, according to estimates from IBS. (All charts: IBS) “We think smartphone applications processors and modems could adopt 12nm FD-SOI as an alternative to 10nm and potentially 7nm FinFETs,” said Jones. If the process is only available from Globalfoundries, Jones estimates it could grow to as much as a quarter of the advanced-node business. However, “if Samsung came in big time I could see market potential of 40-50% of the 14/16/10nm business covered by FD-SOI -- Samsung is the wild card,” he said. China is another wild card, particularly a new fab in the works in Shanghai. Hua Li will get as much as $5.8 billion from the China government to build a new fab. It has not picked a process yet, but “there’s a reasonable possibility they will do FD-SOI,” said Jones. Hua Li already runs about 30,000 wafers per month in an existing 300mm fab. It is part of the Hua Hong group that includes Grace Semiconductor which operates a 200mm fab. SMIC, arguably China’s most advanced locally owned fab, is not likely to adopt FD-SOI. It is focused on ramping 28nm processes in high-k metal gate and polysilicon flavors. “They are making the right choice to be mainstream,” Jones said. China could sustain “big losses” trying to compete with TSMC in the complex FinFET processes. Jones noted TSMC already as many as 500 engineers dedicated to FinFET design enablement. Overall, “It’s a bit too early” to determine what share FinFET, FD-SOI and planar processes will take, said Jones who has estimated the total available market but not market share for FD-SOI Next page: Apple drives FinFETs, 28nm wins FD-SOI has a $17B available market in 2017, but it's unclear how much it will get.

TVTY raises further $6.7M to sync online ad campaigns with offline events Posted Sep 12, 2016 by Steve O'Hear (@sohear) 0 SHARES Next Story Breinify tells online retailers what customers want to buy at a specific point in time TVTY, a startup that enables online ad campaigns to sync with offline events to make online marketing more timely and relevant, has raised $6.7 million in further funding. Serena Capital led the round, while previous investors Partech International and 360 Capital Partners also participated. The company says it will use the new capital to increase headcount in its R&D team and to grow its “customer success” teams across the U.K., U.S. and France in order to accelerate growth. It had previously raised $6.85 million in funding, including a $4.5 million round in 2014. A pioneer of so-called “moment marketing,” TVTY has developed a platform that lets advertisers instantly launch digital marketing campaigns triggered by offline events such as TV shows or commercials, sports events and changes in the weather. It is used by both brands and agencies in more than 40 different countries worldwide, including Sony, Intel, Tesco, O2, GSK, Volkswagen and Nationwide. “It’s more important than ever for brands to be ‘in the moment’ when it comes to their marketing message if they want to cut through the noise, be relevant and optimize their media spend,” says Eliott Reilhac, TVTY CEO in EMEA. “That means delivering powerful messages in real time, that connect with people at the key moments when they reach for their smartphone or tablet to check the web or interact on social media. The problem for brands is how to do this at scale, in an automated fashion and in an ever evolving digital landscape.” To that end, Reilhac says TVTY’s proprietary technology monitors and reacts to more triggers than any other platform on the market (over one million, apparently), such as weather, sports, financial, health, TV ads and pollution. These are thought to be key moments when consumers turn to their devices to go online for more information in which they can also be bombarded with ads relevant to that moment. In addition, the startup’s “Universal Trigger” product lets brands use any public or private data feed to launch what the startup describes as “hyper-targeted moment marketing campaigns.” Examples of these types of data-driven triggers include real-time flight information, stock levels, box-office sales or public transport delays and can be as granular as required. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase TVTY Founded 2009 Overview TVTY enables agencies to optimize the timing of their digital campaigns to fit in the context.

Virtual reality headsets like Intel's Project Alloy and Qualcomm's Snapdragon VR have oodles of sensors and powerful but efficient processors that promise an immersive VR experience without being tethered to a PC. But they're months, if not years, away from commercial availability. If you want that experience now (or as soon as possible), you might consider pairing a current high-end headset with MSI's VR One, a PC in a backpack. It weighs eight pounds, has 90 minutes of battery life, and packs an overclocked Intel Core i7 and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 graphics card. The VR One was born from a concept that MSI announced earlier this year at Computex. It's designed to solve two problems at once: many consumer desktops aren't powerful enough to support an HTC Vive or Oculus Rift, and of the ones that are, many are immense gaming PCs. //Related Articles MSI Tackles Tethered VR Problem With Backpack PC The VR One resembles the laser tag gear you might have worn as a kid. It's almost entirely black, except for two symmetrical red panels surrounding the MSI logo. The most unique aspect of its design is the battery packs: this backpack uses power-hungry desktop components, so MSI bestowed it with two hot-swappable batteries. Indicator lights on each one show the remaining charge. When it reaches a critical level, you can switch one battery at a time without shutting down the PC or connecting it to external power. The components are air cooled, with two fan blades and nine heat pipes offering efficient but very quiet air circulation. MSI says noise output will be less than 41 dba, about standard for a desktop. As for compatibility, the VR One was developed in partnership with HTC, so it will include support for the Vive out of the box, though it should also run competing headsets like the Rift. The company will announce the backpack's pricing and ship date at the Tokyo Game Show later this week.

While the game’s minimum system requirements are fairly tame, players may need to invest in an upgraded GPU to get the most out of their trip to New Bordeaux. Related: 2K’s Mafia III will hit consoles and PCs in October Similar to Rockstar’s Grand Theft Auto series, 2K’s Mafia III features a mixture of open-world exploration and third-person shooting mechanics wrapped up in a crime drama narrative. The latest game in the series takes place in New Bordeaux, a fictional take on New Orleans, and its 1960s-era setting introduces period-appropriate background music and weaponry. PC players may already have the hardware necessary to run Mafia III at its basic settings, as the game demands an Intel I5-2500K or AMD FX-8120 CPU at a minimum, with either a Radeon HD7870 or GeForce GTX 660 equivalent tackling GPU duties. Mafia III also requires a 64-bit version of Windows 7, 50GB of hard drive space, and 2GB of video memory to function. Open-world games are often demanding at higher resolutions and graphics settings, and Mafia III is no different. Publisher 2K recommends an Intel I7-3770 or AMD FX 8350 4.0 GHz equivalent in terms of CPU horsepower, while a Radeon R9 290X, GeForce GTX 780, or GeForce GTX 1060 are required for max settings. Players seeking to render Mafia III at its best possible quality will also need 8GB of RAM and 4GB of video memory, according to 2K’s pre-release estimates. Mafia III is set to be the biggest entry in the series, and 2K is preparing a special collector’s edition for die-hard fans. Players who pick up the collector’s edition at launch will receive an art book, a set of replica dog tags, drink coasters, and collectible art prints as part of the package, along with copies of the game’s score and official soundtrack on vinyl records. Mafia III launches for the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC platforms worldwide on October 7. Also watch: Asus ROG GX700 Hands On Please enable Javascript to watch this video

But a team of scientists from Intel Labs and Darmstadt University in Germany have figured out a way to use data from GTA to better teach autonomous cars how to drive in the real world. By combining an algorithm that can pull visual data from GTA and enter it into a machine learning program, scientists hope to significantly reduce the amount of time needed to collect data. MORE: Apple's $1 Billion Investment Paves Way for Self-Driving Cars The time savings comes from the fact that it takes thousands of hours to teach autonomous cars how to drive, which means either going out and recording video on real roads or using computer-generated scenarios like the ones in GTA. And for those worried about potential issues that might arise from using data from a video game, the scientists say that data from games like GTA can be just as good, if not better than data from real life. It’s important to point out that the algorithm isn’t necessarily instructing autonomous cars how to drive by analyzing traffic patterns. Instead, it's more focused on teaching object recognition so that self-driving cars can tell the difference between other cars and objects like pedestrians or animals. For a more in-depth explanation, check out the short video above from the scientists themselves.

The dual cameras, in particular, suggest a future that could be a step toward a broader play on virtual reality. "Dual camera means depth, and depth means three things," said Alban Denoyel, CEO of 3-D company Sketchfab in an email interview with Recode. Capturing depth information, he said, allows for capturing a three-dimensional scene, positional tracking and gesture recognition. That, he said, puts Apple on equal footing with other players in the space including Intel’s RealSense, Vuforia, Leap Motion and Google Tango. And while Apple didn’t talk about virtual or augmented reality on tage last week, it has expressed interest in the markets and made acquisitions to better position itself, including PrimeSense and LinX. Apple’s initial use of the two cameras is far more modest. As the iPhone 7 ships, the dual cameras are being used only to offer zooming capability. Apple has also said it will add a depth portrait feature later this year that will combine the images to offer a blurred background. "As you know, Apple likes to ship a new hardware feature with one use case first and add uses and iterate over time," mobile expert Benedict Evans told Recode. "So it's more suggestive than tangible." Still, Evans said this represents a big step, reminding people that Apple added a fingerprint sensor to the iPhone a year before it introduced Apple Pay. Adding even more camera modules could lead to even more imaging ability. That’s the approach taken by startup Light, which uses 16 different smartphone modules in an attempt to take on SLR cameras. Even with two cameras, Apple could do more out of the gate. But Apple is letting other companies make their own use of the data coming from the two cameras, potentially meaning others could create virtual reality and other applications ahead of the iPhone maker. "It seems to me they have the hardware ready, but they don’t have everything worked out yet," Light co-founder Rajiv Laroia said in an interview. "Some things have been left for the future or third parties." The dual cameras, only available on the iPhone 7 Plus that goes on sale Friday, are seen as the most tangible way in which Apple’s future is on display in its new phone. It’s not just the cameras, though. Apple’s wireless headphones, called AirPods, also show Apple’s ability to seamlessly connect the iPhone to other devices. While the AirPods do use Bluetooth, Apple has done a lot of work in silicon and in software to make wireless connections simpler and more power efficient. That’s tech that could come in handy for other add-ons well beyond headphones. Also, with iOS 10, Apple is moving further into machine learning. Until now, Apple had been seen as being at risk of falling behind in this area, especially given its strict privacy policy, which limits the amount of data it collects. Apple says it now feels it can both collect the data it needs to get better at things like categorizing photos while also protecting users, using an approach known as differential privacy. And Apple says it won’t collect such information unless people explicitly give their okay. Evans says machine learning appears to have a wide range of uses and sees the technology being "applied very broadly across the industry and not for things that look like obvious database/machine-learning problems." Apple is starting with a few specific areas, such as emoji and deep links within applications. But this, too, appears to be a starting point rather than an end state. iPhone 7 Plus camera features recode_divider In this Storystream All about the iPhone 7 What the iPhone 7 reveals about Apple’s augmented-reality plans What the iPhone 7 tells us about the future of Apple Apple created extra versions of the iPhone 7 in order to make room for an Intel chip View all 13 stories More From Recode Watch Stephen Colbert destroy Apple over its $300 coffee-table book DraftKings and FanDuel used to hate each other.

Now, there’s word that the company is preparing a change to its manufacturing procedure that could help secure an even more dominant position. Samsung is apparently pursuing a longstanding desire to develop a GPU in-house for use with its mobile processors. The company is in talks with both AMD and Nvidia with a view to licensing its GPU technologies, according to a report from Sam Mobile. As far back as 2014, there were rumors that Samsung had hired engineers from companies like AMD, Nvidia, and Intel in order to accelerate its plan for internal GPU development. At one point, it was expected that the firm would be able to implement its Exynos chipset with a proprietary GPU for the Galaxy Note 5 — but this never came to pass. Related: Six-year-old gets burned after Samsung Galaxy Note 7 explodes in his hands At present, Samsung uses the Mali series of GPUs developed by ARM for its Exynos chipsets. However, based on these talks with AMD and Nvidia, it seems that the current arrangement may come to an end sooner rather than later. Shifting to internal development of GPUs would allow Samsung to cut costs accrued outsourcing the components, even allowing for the licensing fees that would need to be paid to whichever company’s tech is being used. It remains to be seen whether the end goal is simply larger profit margins, or the ability to undercut the pricing of its rivals. Given that the company is still in talks with AMD and Nvidia, the situation is still very fluid. However, this weekend’s reporting indicates that Nvidia is currently the front-runner thanks to the strength of its Pascal architecture.

In this report, Technavio covers the market outlook and growth prospects of the global GPU market for 2016-2020. Based on end-user platform, the market is segmented into desktops and notebooks. The notebooks segment dominated the market with over 63% in 2015. Technavio researchers found that the growing adoption of integrated GPU is a major driver for the growth of the market. Integrated GPU is more popular than discrete GPU. Intel, one of the prominent vendors of integrated GPU, claims that their integrated GPU is 30 times more efficient than discrete GPU. This can affect the adoption of discrete GPU units. “The increasing adoption of integrated GPU is mainly attributed to the growing need of enhanced visual content by end-consumers. In addition, end-consumers are demanding high memory graphics in their systems. In order to meet such demands, graphic processor vendors are providing high graphics through integrated GPUs. Currently, notebooks are being designed with integrated GPUs that meet end-user requirements,” says Sunil Kumar Singh, a lead analyst at Technavio for research on embeddedsystems. Technavio’s research study segments the global GPU market into the following regions: APAC Americas EMEA Global GPU market segmentation by geography 2015 (market share %)     APAC 37.10% Americas 32.60% EMEA 30.3% Source: Technavio   APAC: largest GPU market The GPU market in APAC is expected to see a decline during the forecast period because of the withdrawal of consumer interest in laptops. Though the market is not fully saturated with a penetration level of less than 70%, there is a higher demand for laptops because of the reduced ASP. Chromebooks and netbooks are easier options but they require highly developed cloud infrastructure. Also, their ASP is lower than that of traditional or hybridlaptops, which will offset their revenue share even if there is an increase in the unit shipments of Chromebooks and netbooks and hybrid laptops. Hybrid laptops will generate majority of the revenue, but laptop manufacturers will have difficulty in deciding the type of customers they need to pitch their products for, because of the high ASP of laptops. In the first quarter of 2015, hybrid laptops generated higher revenue from commercial customers than from retail or personal customers. Request a sample report: http://www.technavio.com/request-a-sample?report=52974 Technavio’s sample reports are free of charge and contain multiple sections of the report including the market size and forecast, drivers, challenges, trends, and more. Americas: highest laptop sales revenue emerged from the US in 2015 In 2015, 26.54 million units of GPU were shipped in the Americas, and this is expected to increase to 21.9 million units by 2020. From the annual reports of leading laptop manufacturers such as HP, Lenovo, and Apple, it was found that in the premium segment, the highest sales revenue came from the US in 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. Lenovo's Yoga hybrid laptop series generated huge sales revenue in the US. Also, 85% of Chromebooks and netbooks were sold in North America, with 90% of the sales revenue coming from educational institutes. As the Chromebook and netbook market in North America is already getting saturated, the only source of revenue from such a market is innovative hybrid laptop products. New range of hybrid laptop products to rejuvenate growth in EMEA The GPU market in EMEA is highly saturated and the socio-economic factors have not been favorable in recent years; hence, the growth was comparatively low. However, the new range of hybrid laptop products is designed to rejuvenate the interest of customers looking for innovative products. The laptop manufacturers gain profit from hybrid laptops and low-cost Chromebooks and netbooks. Though the hybrid laptop market will target corporate customers, the Chromebooks and netbooks market will target educational institutes, which is similar to the trend in North America. “Europe is the major revenue contributor in EMEA. This is because of high sales of notebooks, desktops, and workstations in this region. The increasing need for enhanced visual content is another major factor contributing to the growth of the market in this region,” adds Sunil. The top vendors in the global GPU market highlighted in the report are: AMD NVIDIA Browse Related Reports: Global Gaming Console Market 2016-2020 Global Gaming Peripheral Market 2016-2020 Global Gesture Recognition Market for Gaming Consoles 2015-2019 Do you need a report on a market in a specific geographical cluster or country but can’t find what you’re looking for?

Apple highlighted the difference on the technical specification page for the iPhone 7. Models A1778 and A1784 do not support CDMA networks, such as those used by Verizon and Sprint. The reason these models don't support CDMA is likely Apple's decision to diversify suppliers using Intel for the modem in the AT&T and T-Mobile models and Qualcomm for the modem in the other models. Re/code confirms this is likely the case, "Sources familiar with the situation as well as outsiders agree that the modem diversification effort is the likely reason for the separate phone versions. Apple and Intel declined to comment on the matter, and a Qualcomm representative was not immediately available for comment."

I preordered two CDMA phones so I could get the Qualcomm chip: -a 256GB 7 (for the 128GB price) in Black from Sprint (shippin 9/16) -a 128GB Jet Black 7+ from Verizon ("arriving November") After I run some tests I'll probably only keep the +. FYI Sprint said I'd have to keep the device active for 50 days at Sprint before they'll unlock it.

Without knowing this, I could end up paying $850 brand new phone that cannot support my future carrier network... and the Apple, I really dont know what the hell is the deal with this thing. 2 separate version for "unlocked" iphones. what year is this??? 2009?

Christoph Hagleitne presented IBM’s view of the major applications where FPGAs can provide differentiation such as cognitive computing, high performance computing and the Internet of Things. He described two complementary approaches to establish heterogeneous computing systems in cloud datacenters. The first approach is based on heterogeneous supernodes that tightly couple compute resources to multi-core CPUs and their coherent memory system via high-bandwidth, low latency interconnects like CAPI or NVlink. The second approach is based on the disaggregation of data center resources where the individual compute, memory, and storage resources are connected via the network fabric and can be individually optimized and scaled in line with the cloud paradigm.

Simple titled “Get the Surface Pro,” the 30-second ad highlights Microsoft’s Surface Pro 4 hybrid device which includes a stylus and comes with a detachable keyboard and an Intel chip allowing it to be transformed into a computer that runs Windows, Office and other real desktop applications. Using the same singer from the previous commercial, the new video informs us that “If you try to write on a plain old Mac, the difference can be seen. It doesn’t work.” “With a pen that lets you write on the screen, a detachable keyboard, and tunes like this, Surface Pro 4 is the easy choice,” says Microsoft. And here’s the new Surface ad. Microsoft’s anti-Apple campaign for the Surface Pro includes other stingy commercials, one calling the MacBook Air “less useful, like a hat for your cat” and the others boasting about such Surface Pro 4 features as Intel Core processor, detachable keyboard with real keys and a trackpad, pen, touchscreen, full Office and external ports. “Everything else is just late to the party,” argues Microsoft in another dig at Apple and its latest iPad Pro ads which attempt to position the device as a computer replacement.

Prasoon Singh Yup. Dany Quirion so why making phone of it? its competitor is the ipad not mac XD Umut Topuz no its not due to its operating system. its much like a ultrabook with optinal keyboard. A bit weird but it is George It’s a hybrid. Srv Rungta so we’re comparing apples with oranges now! …hmm… great!! (NOT) Julio Hernandez Well Surface Pro is better than iPad or MacBooks in my opinion smtp25 Well Apple is trying to say iPad pro is laptop replacement, so fair enuff that the pit the surface against the iPad. iPad is cool, I have 2 but they are no laptop or surface – different tool for different jobs. paul_krupa If the only tool you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. You can’t run MacOS on a Windows machine so I’m not your likely convert back to Windows. Why would I want to use Windows? Not so many surfaces sold compared to iPads or MacBooks. Surface has some nice elements to it but at the end of the day it’s a Windows machine. I only use those when I have to. Oh, the ad was okay. Sort of like Trump without the vulgarity. Umut Topuz I was using dual os. windows 10 and macos on my surface pro 3 paul_krupa I’ve seen where MacOS can run on other platforms but I can’t get a legal way to do that. Further, it’s a big ask to buy into what I consider a lot of Windows baggage (not being derogatory just stating that I don’t want to get too involved in another OS, especially all the registry stuff) in order to run my preferred platform. Further still, I am not a touch screen advocate for laptops and prefer the trackpad. So in my case I prefer running fusion when I need windows. And Fusion allows me to manage my VM’s on my home server without having to run the windows app (except for a few tasks). :D The real joke is Windows gary You mean the most widely-distributed operating system in the world? I am not advocating one side of this argument over the other, I just think this comment is dumb. :D The real joke is that such a crappy OS is the most widely-distributed OS in the world. Happy? gary You didn’t happen to stop and think that you might be in the extremely small minority on that one and that you’re not really clever? :D Is that so? I’m not clever? If you had any idea of the things I’ve accomplished then you would be eating those words. I look down at you. gary LMAO Jm Android is the most widely-distributed OS in the world by nearly 5 times of Windows, so not sure why you’re bringing Android into the discussion. But even iOS/OS X has more usage than Windows in 2016, so your delusional bias against OS X is not only stupid based on its own merits, but it’s factually incorrect. Try again. gary I think there are two things you missed: 1) this conversation is clearly about desktop operating systems given the context of the article and both his and my comments. Also, android is not distributed five times as much as Windows, that is simply wrong and ludicrous. 2) I think you also missed the part where I said I’m not advocating for either side, so this “delusional bias against OS X” doesn’t exist. I use both operating systems and like each for what they are good at. I know where your ‘delusional bias’ sits though. Gabriel Anaya Hey guys,make sure to upgrade to MacOS Sierra ASAP, or Apple will charge you $100 bucks to upgrade after the first year. Okay not really but how stupid would that be? Umut Topuz its a bit weird but apple was forcing people to pay $10 for ios 1 to 2 upgrade 🙂 :D OS X updates used to be charged for too – Apple Just decided to make updates free. The thing is that MS made Windows 10 free for anyone who updates in the first year. Anyone who updates after a year has to pay. Maybe it’s just their way of improving adoption rates but it’s still pretty stupid imo. Umut Topuz dont understand why it had too much intention. they just let people to go for an upgrade for free. maybe they are moving to that way just like apple did? What if they put a price without letting you upgrade in a year? 🙂 George You’re already paying for software you just don’t see it. Paying over $1200 for a laptop is buying into the ecosystem. Jeffrey Well you can sell your 1200 dollar macbook 3 years later for 900 dollars and you can sell your 1200 dollar windows laptop (with payed OS) 3 years later for 150 dollars… What do you choose? George I know that, I’m a Mac user. I’m just saying windows PCs are cheaply priced which is why they can get away with separately charging you for a big software release. Jeffrey Well, yeah, if you look at the short term Windows desktops do in fact sound cheaper, even when you count the software costs, I agree. But when you’re smart, you think about the long term 🙂 PhoneTechJay I see where you were headed with this comment but you are forgetting that windows labtops can cost this much too… George And also Microsoft is a software company, you don’t think it’s silly for a software company to be giving away free software? They wouldn’t be here today. Agneev Mukherjee Are we running short on crazy? This Surface proves nothing less. Agneev Mukherjee The cat looks absurd. I like Cookie Monster better. Agneev Mukherjee Hover your cursor over the blank area between here You’ve found it! and here. Agneev Mukherjee var foo = 'bar'; alert('foo'); Mike M. Powell Am I the only that that Actually doesn’t care that Mac doesn’t allow fingerprint? Prasoon Singh You know why the Mac doesn’t have a touchscreen? Because it’s not a freaking tablet! That’s what iPads are for. These ads makes me mad. Umut Topuz ipads are just big touchscreen gaming device for me. it doesnt have a fully functional operating system, not even a usb port? so due its hardware specs and type of things it do, equivalent is macbook anon Weird, since iOS 10 my iPad took over and I only use my PC for games occasionally. Umut Topuz it is just a nearby couch device for me, even i use it with jailbreak, i just dont find it useful enough to pay that price for an ipad besides a surface smtp25 totally agree – its great for games, videos, web browsing.. ahh that’s all I used it for.. even serious web browsing I find easier and quick on the laptop with mouse smtp25 Because lots of newer laptops have touch screens now, and because of tablets people have a higher expectation to be able to touch the screen to do something and be disappointed when they remember they can’t ravinigga Somebody just hack or put macos on iPad Pro with touch capabilities. Then we talk. Btw love both Alberto Espinal I’ve never had this product but I’m gonna quote someone that had one and this is what he said: “It doesn’t really matter if it’s a tablet in form, and features a touchscreen etc.. When you have next to none “touch optimised” apps and user experiences to offer. All the “apps” in the Windows Store are plain horrible and lacklustre. The amount of apps offered are really low, and the ones being offered often costs money for no apparent reason and they don’t really offer anything. The whole tablet / touch ecosystem is non-existent” anon Of course the keyboard comes off when you sell it separately Joseph Apodaca Wow. Now I’m going to get a surface pro solely for a touchscreen display. *sarcasm smtp25 I’m not getting one because its probably not powerful enough graphics wise to play games high end PC games, so big price tag small result Umut Topuz so you are expecting to play high end games on a laptop priced as a surface by not having a console or desktop. very genius act, go for it 🙂 smtp25 what are you on about? Surface 4 i5/8GB/256GB is NZD$2349 or i7 $2899. I can get a laptop for $2300/2800 that will play high end games. Console, well they suck because I like using a mouse for FPS. And a desktop obviously sucks as its not portable. Umut Topuz allright, play “high end” fps games on a laptop with mid range gpu with your mouse for an hour of portability which may fit your needs. what are you up to? Its your waste and i dont care smtp25 Aww Umut you do care Fede all microsoft products suck !!! starting with windows, they are losing the battleground because they were a monopoly of computers for some time, now they are gone !!!   Search Connect with iDownloadBlog Facebook Become a fan RSS Get the latest news YouTube Watch Us Twitter Stay up to date Newsletter News delivered to you Google+ Add us to your circle   The most recent headlines Google revamps Play Newsstand, adds For You recommendations, rich media, web app & more Apple launches worldwide “Touch Disease” repair program for iPhone 6 Plus How to show the storage drive icon on your Mac desktop How to mention someone in your Instagram story MacBook Pro with Touch Bar now available for in-store pickup   The latest jailbreak news Jailbreak tweaks of the week: EmojiSuggest, PasswordRecovery, & more… EmojiSuggest brings iOS 10-like emoji suggestions to the predictive keyboard WiJoin lets you know what Wi-Fi network you’re connected to PasswordRecovery stores passwords and recovers them when you forget them NCTextColor lets you add vibrancy to Notification Center iDownloadBlog           iDownloadblog.com About About Advertise Contact Keep in Touch Twitter Facebook RSS Feed Newsletter Push Notifications Podcasts Let's Talk iOS Let's Talk Jailbreak Site Stuff Disclosure Privacy Policy   Copyright iDownloadBlog 2016.

How we used Linux 12 September 2016 on linux Introduction Industrial Automation is an industry that's always 10 years behind mainstream technologies. This is partly due to the large monopoly held by the three main players, Siemens, Allen Bradley & Wonderware. This has led to an unfortunate lack of innovation, especially in native industrial web applications, Which are almost nonexistent. At Bubble Automation we saw this as an issue. Most clients who wanted remote monitoring capabilities of their sites were stuck using clunky add-ons. Add-ons requiring large license fees and maintenance costs, or insecure TeamViewer/VNC connections needing third party tools to be installed on the clients machines. Our Aim We wanted to build a modern secure native web application that required no browser or PC plugins. Need to provide live data and work on any device e.g mobile, tablet, netbook & desktop to prevent the need for unnecessary platform dependant apps. For security, the web server had to be on the customer's premise, small enough to be put in a control panel and robust enough to survive industrial conditions. Choosing the Framework NodeJS was the first framework we tested, it seemed promising but at the time wasn't the most stable or well-supported platform. The biggest issue was connecting to a database using their experimental database module. After trial and error with various frameworks, opting for a pure Python solution seemed most convenient partly due to our in-house python experience, but most importantly its wide module support. Selecting the Right Hardware After a very brief experience using current industrial grade single board computers, it was immediately obvious they weren't suitable. Most use out-dated Intel Atoms in large noisy enclosures. This sent us on the path of today's competitive credit sized PC market, listed are a few we've tried: Raspberry Pi 2 Model B Raspberry Pi 1 Model B ODROID-U3 Odroid C1 Odroid XU4 Each board was extensively tested running our Python framework with unrealistic loads. The board that stood out was the ODROID XU4 which was clearly superior all round as shown in the benchmarks below. This board had far better CPU and network performance, but most importantly much higher I/O speeds and bandwidth which was critical for our MySQL database. dhrystone Results are an index relative to a SPARCstation 20-61 (rated at 10.0) Source whetstone Results are an index relative to a SPARCstation 20-61 (rated at 10.0) Source hdparm Results are in megabytes per second. Source dd Results are in megabytes per second. Source Architecture & Software Design The basic starting point was to create a daemon that could read Modbus registers over TCP/IP from the field as shown in figure 1. This later grew to a context sensitive event based system that could translate field events into Alarms, Live Trending, Historical graphs, Event logs, & notification emails. Figure 1. Providing this information to the client proved to be a difficult task; displaying Real Time information on a web page in pure HTML5 requiring no plugins has never been easy. Using techniques such as long polling would only lead to crashing the browser as there was just far too much information that needed to be fed into the browser at relatively high speed, at around 1-second scan intervals. Our solutions came back to the reason NodeJS was such a good candidate for Real Time data solutions, that was Web Sockets. This provides full-duplex communication over a TCP connection. Thankfully we came across a powerful PHP Library that provided this functionality. For this reason, we could build all server side components in PHP using Twitter Bootstrap to provide a simple interface with responsive design at its forefront. A LEMP stack (Linux, Nginx, MySQL, & PHP) is used to provide a robust base with speed, stability, & reliability for our PHP, HTML, & Javascript front-end. The main reasons for using Nginx over Apache is its better utilization of multicore processors assigning a worker per core, and its better security track record over Apache. Front-end screenshot Security Due to the nature of our industry, building our application secure by design was critical. A lot of time was spend creating a secure login not vulnerable to SQL Injection, Session Hijacking, Cross Site Scripting, & Brute Force Attacks. To top this off we created a hardened minimal Linux image to use on our servers this is kept up to date with all of the current security patches. We work strictly on a non-control basis meaning in the unlikely event our software is compromised, there is no way the intruder could damage your site. Our software only monitors the state of the field and does not affect the control process. Conclusion Thanks to the high availability of small inexpensive single board computers and the large progression in Open Source software development, Bubble Automation has managed to bring innovation to an industrial market which is usually slow to take on modern ideologies. Our choice of using an Open Source foundation has eliminated expensive licensing fees and running costs for us and our clients giving our software a competitive edge.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search UMi Super Review (Euro Edition) JC Torres - Sep 12, 2016 4 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Editors' Rating: 7/10 Pros Competitive specs straddling mid and high range Fast charging right out of the box Near vanilla Android experience Choice between on-screen or capacitive navigation buttons Sub-$200 price tag Cons Camera is slow, too much noise in low light Smart Key can't be used when phone is still locked, can't function as camera shutter There are dozens of smartphone brands, many of them hailing from China, competing in the mid-range market that it is too easy to get lost in a sea of names, models and specs. So when a little known company poises itself as a flagship killer, with a price that neither OnePlus nor even Xiaomi can beat, it’s hard not to pause and take notice. In not so many words, or actually in quite many words, that is what the UMi Super aspires to be, and it does almost reach that pinnacle. Well, as high as a mid-range can reach. Read on to find out how that dream almost came to be. Specs Here’s a quick rundown of the UMi Super’s key hardware features, just to give you an overview of what’s in store: • Operating System: Android 6.0 Marshmallow • CPU: MediaTek Helio P10 octa-core • RAM: 4 GB Samsung LPDDR3 • Storage: 32 GB Samsung eMMC 5.1 • Display: 5.5-inch 1920×1080 Sharp LTPS • Main Camera: 13 megapixel Panasonic sensor • Secondary Camera: 5 megapixels • Battery: Sony 4,000 mAh, MediaTek Quick Charge PE+ The UMi Super straddles the fine line between mid-range and flagship, pairing a mid-range chip, the Helio P10, with 4 GB of memory found in most high-end smartphones this year. But perhaps more noticeable is how UMi seems to be name-dropping the makers of much of its components, aside from the processor, of course. Unless you’re Samsung or LG, chances are you’d be using components made by other companies. some of which might even be your competitors. Not even Apple is immune to that. UMi’s admission is admittedly a bit unusual in a fiercely competitive market like smartphones. At least, perhaps in UMi’s mind, it would assure buyers that they are getting a smartphone with quality components made by popular brands. Of course, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, and a mish-mash of super components does not a super smartphone make. Luckily for the UMi Super, it does in this case. Somewhat. Performance Processor No matter how the marketing tries to spin it, the Helio P10 is MediaTek’s mid-range processor, compared to its Helio X20 chip. It is like the Snapdragon 625 to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 820, or the Core m to Intel’s Core i. That’s not to downplay the capabilities of the chip but to properly frame it in the correct context. Which is to say that it won’t be running blazing fast, but it gets the job done, especially with a generous 4 GB of RAM. The UMi Super’s performance on Geekbench and AnTuTu benchmarks were quite impressive for a 2016 mid-ranger. On Geekbench, its multi-core score of 2665 outperforms even the NVIDIA SHIELD Tablet’s Tegra K1 chip as well as the Nexus 6. While the results on AnTuTu might not be that encouraging, it is being compared to late 2015 and early 2016 flagships. In short, the UMi Super is quite on par with 2014 smartphone champions and would solidly beat its contemporaries this year. Display A smartphone, however, isn’t simply a shrunken down computer. Most of our time spent with it is almost 95% on the display. That is why the quality of the screen is of utmost importance. Here, UMi’s name-dropping serves it well. A 5.5-inch 1080p display is actually on par with Chinese flagships this years, as those have refused to make the jump to 2K. But more than that, the UMi Super boasts of a display from Sharp. Granted, it’s not the famous Sharp IGZO technology but one of the company’s LTPS panels. That said, the end result is still, well, sharp and bright, an impressive feat for a smartphone of this price. Battery The UMi Super isn’t exactly a small smartphone, though not an obscenely large or thick one. In addition to its 5.5-inch screen, it’s also rather thick, 8.5 mm at the thickest point, though 7.9 mm at the thinnest, thanks to its lightly curving back. You might, however, forgive it that slight when you find out that it boasts of a 4,000 mAh battery from Sony. Again, the name-drop. If that weren’t enough, the UMi Super also boasts of fast charging capabilities, partly thanks to a USB-C connector from Foxconn as well as the “Pump Express Plus” or PE+ fast charging technology from MediaTek itself. For just 30 minutes, you’re promised a full day’s worth of uptime. Extend that to 100 minutes and you reach a full charge. Not bad for a sub $200 smartphone. Design We seem to be happily past the days when “cheap” translated to cheap, flimsy materials, even though not all plastics are such. Even budget-friendly smartphones these days can flaunt all their metal sides and edges. The UMi Super is similar, boasting of an all-metal body made from aircraft-grade alloy. The UMi Super’s design seems to revolve around the ideas of minimalism and simplicity, both in the design of the hardware itself as well as the software, as we’ll see later. The overall shape of the device is one most will be familiar with, with flat, chamfered edges and a tri-segmented rear that curves ever so slightly to both accommodate a larger battery as well as offer a better fit inside users’ hands. The back has nothing but the camera, the dual LED flash beneath, and the fingerprint scanner below that. Around the edges, there are no hidden surprises, though one might jump to the conclusion that there is no headphone jack given the solitary USB-C port at the bottom. The 3.5 mm port, however, is located at the top. On the right side you get the usual volume rocker as well as a power button. On the opposite left edge is the SIM and microSD card hybrid slot as well as a “smart key” that can be configured to quickly launch any app of choice. The front of the smartphone is even more bare. No branding or even buttons in sight. At least not physical buttons. In lieu of a physical home button, the UMi Super has a capacitive one that is marked by an LED halo. This isn’t a simple aesthetic feature either. Flanking this home “button” are two other capacitive buttons for navigation. As we’ll see later, however, that’s not yet the complete story. A rather interesting design choice is one that’s available for a very limited time, in very limited numbers, and in limited markets. This special Euro Edition comes in a bright shade of royal blue, a hue that you won’t easily find among all metal smartphones. There are only 999 such devices available, which are bound to be head turners because of their spectacular specular. Camera These days, smartphones makers are putting a lot of focus on the camera, no pun intended. While the UMi Super is definitely no different, the end result is a mixed bag. On paper, the smartphone boasts of a 13 megapixel Panasonic sensor that has zero shutter lag and takes only 0.3 seconds to focus. In practice, however, the UMi Super failed to live up to its claims of speed. Slow cameras translate to missed moments. High megapixel counts become worthless when you fail to take that once in a lifetime shot just right. That said, the camera does a decent job under ideal conditions, namely, bright, but not so bright, ambient light, sufficient contrast, and slow-moving or still subjects. The camera’s quality breaks down easily in low light situations, where even the dual flash can’t help reduce the resulting noise. Again, the key here is that the UMi Super offers a decent camera you won’t easily find in smartphones of its price tier. Software and Features The UMi Super’s minimalist theme extends to its software. Unlike its Chinese peers, UMi offers no special Android user experience or UX. You are basically getting an almost Nexus experience with the vanilla Android 6.0 Marshmallow right out of the box. Those who customize their Android phones with mods and add-ons will probably love how they can start with a blank slate. And no Android user will complain about how fast and responsive a non-bloated Android experience can be. Of course, there are a few special features included, and perhaps the most special one are the navigation buttons. As mentioned, there are capacitive buttons, one “halo” and two invisible ones. However, UMi also gives users the choice to turn those off and switch to on-screen buttons instead, pretty much like an untouched Android. But UMi doesn’t stop there either. You can swap the positions of the back and recent apps buttons to your hand preference, which would probably explain the invisible capacitive buttons. But wait, there’s more! When using on-screen navigation buttons, you can also slide them away so that you have the whole span of the screen for content, no matter what app you’re in. One other feature of the UMi Super is also one of its most curious. The LED glow around the capacitive home button is actually configurable to use different colors depending on the source of the notification. You can, for example, set a different color for missed calls, one for alarms, and another one for Facebook alerts. This is similar to the new Smart Glow feature that Samsung introduced in the new Galaxy J2 (2016), except in the front where it is more visible and noticeable. Wrap-up You might get the idea that the UMi Super is simply a decent, good looking mid-range smartphone that offers a vanilla Android experience. Truth be told, taken in isolation, that’s pretty much what it is. But here’s the clincher: the UMi Super costs only $180 at its lowest (some retailers do hold it hostage for $220). And that limited edition blue Euro Edition? $199. Even Xiaomi, notorious for its dirt cheap prices, will have trouble matching that in terms of back for buck, not to mention market availability. The price point is usually reserved for entry-level devices that won’t be able to compete in specs, features, and design. So to rephrase it a bit, the UMi Super is a decent mid-range smartphone, made from premium materials, with an almost pure Android experience, and a entry-level price tag. It’s really hard not to get floored by that. The recent spate of new mid-range challengers in the smartphone market heralds a new phase in the history of the device, where everyone who isn’t Samsung, Apple, LG, and the like are instead battling out in below the flagship line. It is, however, also blurring the lines between tiers and prices. And the UMi Super just demonstrated that if you try hard enough, you can indeed make miracles.

Pat Gelsinger   Spread the Word: News By Tag: * Pat Gelsinger * DFW Technology PB * Vmware By Industry: * EventIRVING, Texas - Sept. 12, 2016 - PRLog -- Pat Gelsinger, CEO of VM Ware will be guest speaker for the DFW Technology Prayer Breakfast.  More than 700+ Technology Leaders are expected to attend the event held September 30, 2016 at Irving Convention Center in Irving, Texas.  2016 marks the third year of this gathering and it has grown year over year. Pat Gelsinger has been the CEO of VMware since 2012 and under his leadership, VMware has expanded from its core strength in virtualization to become a recognized industry leader in hybrid cloud services, enterprise mobility and the software-defined data center. VMware's "One cloud, any app, any device" architecture for IT is transforming the way businesses compete and is powering business mobility far beyond BYOD. Prior to joining VMware, Pat was President and COO of EMC's Information Infrastructure Products business, overseeing engineering and operations and leading the office of the CTO. He began his career at Intel, where he served as the company's first CTO and was the architect of the original 486 processor. In 2008 Pat was named a Fellow of the IEEE and awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Letters in 2008 from William Jessup University. He is also the author of the book "Balancing Your Family, Faith, & Work." If you are within the IT space you will want to hear Gelsinger speak of his experiences, successes, failures and God's blessings in his career and you may want to host a table and invite your employees, customers, vendors and partners.  If you are an individual who wants to learn more about sharing Christ in your workplace, then grab a friend and buy an individual ticket. This event is designed to create an environment where people can hear how Jesus Christ has changed the lives of Dallas/Fort Worth Technology professionals and encourage us all to live out our faith at work and home.  Sign up today as a Sponsor (https://dfwtechnologyprayerbreakfast.wordpress.com/sponso...), Table Host (https://dfwtechnologyprayerbreakfast.wordpress.com/table-...) or individual and invite other to join you September 30, 2016.  Over 70 Table Host have signed up and there is still room for you, so check out the website for a list of the individuals and companies who will be present. Steve Helms, President of the DFW Technology Prayer Breakfast said, "Having Pat Gelsinger join the event as this year's keynote speaker is something we've been looking forward to since we started the breakfast.  His experience is relevant to all of those who work in and around the DFW Technology community, and we have seen his personal story make a powerful impact in the lives of those who hear it." So what is a Prayer Breakfast? We believe that most people are searching for something more out of life but are not sure what that is.  We believe that longing will only be filed through a personal relationship with GOD and His son Jesus Christ.  Our Prayer Breakfast event creates a place for us to share just what that looks like in our personal and professional lives. Our Mission is very simple: "To create relevant business environments for DFW Technology Professionals where a life-changing relationship with Jesus Christ is presented and nurtured."

The XMG P507 doesn’t look like much, but its dour exterior conceals one of the world’s most potent laptop GPUs – the new mobile variant of the GTX 1070. The new GPU uses Nvidia’s stunning Pascal architecture, which delivered huge performance and efficiency improvements on in desktop form. How does it handle the thermal challenges of a laptop? With aplomb. Video: How to choose a laptop in 2016 Related: Best PC games XMG P507 – Features It’s worth taking a second just to explain Nvidia’s naming strategy with its latest line of mobile GPUs – it’s a little confusing. The GTX 1070 inside this laptop is actually the same part as the desktop card, with the same Pascal architecture – something that's only now possible because of the huge efficiency gains that Nvidia made with its new hardware. The only differences between the desktop and mobile parts are minor specification changes, which mean that mobile users now get the same high-end, VR-friendly experience as desktop gamers. Video: Watch our review of the desktop Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 The GTX 1070 inside this laptop is fearsome. The mobile variant has 2,048 stream processors and a 1,645MHz boost clock, while the desktop card has 1,920 stream processors but a higher clock speed. The mobile core retains the 8GB of GDDR5 memory of its desktop counterpart alongside an 8,000MHz clock speed. Those specifications blow away the equivalent machines from the previous generation. Since this XMG is the first gaming laptop we've reviewed from the current generation, comparisons are hard. For the purposes of this review, I'll compare it to two laptops from the previous generation: one larger and one smaller. It's safe to assume that both will be updated with 10-series GPUs shortly. The larger, 17.3-inch CyberPower Fangbook 4 SK-X17 had a desktop-class GTX 980 that also has 2,048 stream processors, but its peak 1,253MHz speed and 4GB of memory pale in comparison to the GTX 1070. The Gigabyte Aorus X3 Plus V5 had a GTX 970M that has 6GB of memory but only 1,280 stream processors and a 993MHz average boost. There’s a lot to like about the rest of the XMG’s specification, even if the rest of this machine doesn’t push the envelope. The Core i7-6700HQ is one of Intel’s mobile stalwarts thanks to its four cores, 2.6GHz stock speed and 3.5GHz peak. There’s the familiar 16GB of DDR4 memory, and storage is divided between a 256GB Samsung SM951 M.2 SSD and a 1TB hard disk. The screen is pretty conventional: a 15.6-inch model with G-Sync and a 1080p resolution. The former feature eliminates juddering by matching the GPU’s output with the screen’s refresh rate, and it’s a welcome addition – but the 1080p resolution seems odd, as the GTX 1070 can easily handle far more pixels. Connectivity is good: Gigabit Ethernet, dual-band 802.11ac wireless and Bluetooth on the inside, and three USB 3 ports alongside pairs of USB 3.1 Type-C and Mini DisplayPort connectors around the edges. There are also slots for SD and SIM cards. As ever, different specifications are available if you don’t need this machine’s level of power. Dropping down to the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 reduces the price to £1,609, and the cheapest specification has the GTX 1060 alongside 8GB of single-channel memory, a small hard disk, no SSD and no operating system for a tempting £1,299 including VAT. Related: Best SSDs to buy XMG P507 – Design Little on the outside suggests that this machine is one of the most powerful gaming notebooks on the market. The P507 is made from aluminium and the lid is decorated with a subtle XMG logo. Ease the 15.6-inch screen back and the interior is just as subtle: there’s a tiny XMG logo beneath the screen and a group of stickers on the wrist-rest, but that’s it. This is not necessarily a bad thing. The CyberPower and Aorus are much more obvious gaming machines with the former serving up a multi-coloured backlit keyboard and the latter cramming dramatic vents into its 13.3-inch frame. The XMG weighs in at 2.94kg and is 32mm at its thickest point. That’s comfortably lighter and slimmer than the CyberPower and its 17.3-inch screen, but about a kilo heavier and almost a centimetre thicker than the Aorus. In short, this machine slots right in between the competition, and it’s not so thick and heavy that it’s going to be awkward to carry it around, as long as you don't plan on actually using it on the move. Build quality is only middling – a slight disappointment for a laptop that costs nearly £2,000. There aren’t any major issues, but there’s a bit of a give in the wrist-rest and keyboard, and the base panel also exhibits a little weakness. There’s a huge amount of flex in the screen. This doesn't mean the whole thing's going to crumble after six months, but it just doesn't feel as grand as a £2,000 laptop should. The XMG lends itself to tinkering and upgrading. The base panel pops off easily after a few screws are removed, and the memory, SSD and hard disk are all accessible. The heatpipes and fans are easy to reach, and there’s room for another 2.5-inch hard disk inside, alongside a couple of spare M.2 connectors.

The card will be outdated by newer versions of Direct X, etc before it starts struggling to output smooth frame rates, especially with G Sync. I'm quite frankly sick and tired of laptop manufacturers going "it's HD!" as if that's something good. It might be for TVs, but PCs should have surpassed this kind of resolution yonks ago. When I was in the market for a laptop it took me ages to find a decent laptop without a "HD" screen being thrust in your face (which inevitably meant 720p)... The term "HD" took PC monitors back to the age of essentially running at the same resolution / pixel density as provided by 1024x768 which had long been surpassed but they lept on this HD crap to allow them to cheap out on the screen whilst making the marketing department happy. I ended up buying a bloody Mac to get a half decent screen resolution with all the other features I wanted, which was really annoying. joyce_duncan September 12, 2016, 1:08 pm I am making something like $6,000-$8,000 on monthly basis with an internet task. So if you are ready to do easy computer-based task for 2-5 hours every day at your home and get decent benefit in the same time... Test this invitation UR1.CA/pg5kh ujyj emtee September 12, 2016, 5:11 pm Does anyone actually buys crap like this? I dont understand.... It looks crappier than crap, i mean a basic shape like a Macbook is much easier to create and more appealing. Peace Keeper September 22, 2016, 6:00 pm This machine isn't that bad maybe the problem is with XMG (I think it's the same P650RS-G that Sager use to build the NP8153) it cost hundreds of dollars less than any other brand, I bought the NP8153 from Xotic with 4K panel but with 8GB DDR4 2400 and 1TB HDD for 1629$. So I will test it when arrive in 15 days and report the quality.

But he did raise a smile from me in some of his comments over the contentious issue of Apple. The Republic of Ireland is trying to make sense of the recent ruling announced by Margrethe Vestager, the European Competition Commissioner, that Apple owes it £11 billion. Although that sum would pay the cost for a year of the country’s health service, recognising that if it seems too good to be true it probably is, serious Irish politicians and 62% of the public supported an appeal. The Irish are not mugs. They are well aware that since the 1980s their prosperity has depended on foreign direct investment by large — usually American — multinationals. More than 130,000 often high-grade jobs are widely provided by such companies as Boston Scientific, Dell, Facebook, Google, Intel, Hewlett Packard — and Apple — thus doing wonders not just for employment but for the country’s image. Ireland’s well-educated, English-speaking, EU workforce is attractive, but so too is its very low corporate tax rate of 12.5%, which Brussels — with its passion for uniformity — wants to get rid of. The Irish see the Apple ruling as a means on the road to that end, and remember the story of the farmer who was lucky enough to have a goose that daily laid a golden egg. Greed drove him to slay the bird, which then turned out to be no more valuable than any other dead goose.  There are other snags too about grabbing the money, not least that the US would like the tax for itself, and that the Commission has said that other EU countries could claim part of the tax if they believe that sales “could have been recorded in their jurisdictions”. Even if the Irish Government obeyed orders, there would be every chance it would still have to spend fortunes and years on legal wrangles. Ireland-EU relations are so tense people are beginning to whisper about ‘Irexit’, and honest public debate is a vital priority. That’s tough for Sinn Fein, whose lack of principle has been even more than usually evident over the past several months. Having been opposed to membership since before Ireland and the UK joined the European Economic Community in 1973, Sinn Fein did a U-turn for electoral reasons and opposed Brexit. In the Republic that abandoned the anti-EU battlefield to the far-Left. Now, as genuine anti-capitalists, People Before Profit and its allies are happy to demand the Irish Government take the money and run. But Sinn Fein — which tries to portray itself as a credible future coalition partner in the Republic — was left floundering and unable to address the practical arguments. So, from the blog of the always economically-challenged Mr Adams, we eventually got a tirade against world poverty, tax avoidance and various other wrongs that no Irish politician would dream of defending.  “Tax revenues,” he explained to the half-witted among us, “are the means by which public services are funded, by which we pay for social protections and from which infrastructure is developed.” Ignoring all complexities, he says, the Irish Government should take the money and spend it fast.  For “Sinn Fein believes firmly in tax fairness — that means that every person and every company pays their fair share of tax”. What’s more, “that has been our consistent position”. Let’s ignore that the IRA defrauded both states on this island throughout the Troubles and beyond.  It’s only last February that Mr Adams’ great friend, that “good republican” multi-millionaire Thomas ‘Slab’ Murphy, was jailed for brazen tax evasion. What can you do but laugh?

The company will use the funds mainly to enhance product capability and user experience and to expand its sales and marketing teams, Ajay Singh said. He didn’t reveal the names of the other investors. California, US-based Stoodnt Inc entered India, its first international market, this year. It has an office in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu. Singh founded the company last year along with Yuri Punj, Sena Palanisami and Ramdas Sunder. Singh had earlier worked with American Express, Cendant, Intel and Booz Allen. Palanisami, who is credited to have set up HP’s software operations in India, is also the founder of San Jose-based ViSolve, the engineering arm of Stoodnt. Punj, an MBA graduate from Harvard Business School, had worked with UBS Investment Bank, JP Morgan Chase, Schroders and M&T Bank in the past. Sunder has worked as a consultant with companies such as McKinsey, Freescale and Pitney Bowes. Besides connecting students, with counsellors and colleges, the platform claims it gives them access to admission insights and admission tools. The company claims it has offered its services to more than 1,000 students so far. As per its website, it has helped students get admitted in world-renowned institutions such as Harvard, Stanford, Yale and Cornell. The services offered include college selection, application, interview preparation, financial aid and visa guidance. The company competes with the likes of mycollegesabroad.com, which provides consulting services to students planning to study abroad, and CollegeDekho, which last year raised funding from Jaipur-based Girnar Software Pvt. Ltd, the company behind auto portal CarDekho and BikeDekho. Stoodnt is among several ed-tech startups that have caught investors’ attention this year. Last week, ed-tech startup Byju’s raised $50 million (Rs 332 crore) in a round co-led by Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, marking the first investment of the philanthropic foundation of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and wife Priscilla Chan in Asia. Prozo.com, an online marketplace for buying and selling study material, recently raised its pre-Series A round of funding from a London-based venture capital firm and two affluent individuals. Last month, ed-tech platform Unacademy raised Rs 6.7 crore from a clutch of investors including Flipkart co-founders Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal and Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma. Among other ed-tech startups, Oliveboard has raised funding from the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation. In late February, ed-tech firm Carveniche Technologies Pvt. Ltd secured angel funding from Calcutta Angels, Lead Angels and a bunch of wealthy individuals. Like this report? Sign up for our daily newsletter to get our top reports.

ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ L&T x Loading data... ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ ET Intelligence Group: Investors may skip the initial public offering (IPO) of L&T Technology Services. The offer price makes its valuation expensive when compared with peers.Investors may , however, consider buying the company's stock on dips after listing due to its niche focus on engineering design and research and strong parentage in the form of India's largest infrastructure company, Larsen & Toubro (L&T). The parent's stake will fall to 89.8% in L&T Technology from current 100% after the listing. BUSINESS With over 9,400 employees across 12 global delivery centres, the company provides engineering, re search and development services in the fields of manufacturing, technology, and process engineering. Some of its clients in clude BMW, Caterpillar, John Deere and Intel. It derives over half of the revenue from transportation and industrial segments. The US and the European Union form 60% and 20% of its total revenue, respectively.The company has significant presence in research and design services (ERD).It works with 43 of the top 100 global ERD spenders. Globally , product engineering market is estimated to be close to $ 215 billion and India's share is just over $20 billion.Within this, the share of third-party vendors such as L&T Technologies is $7.8 billion. To take advantage of the opportunity , the company has a strategy of expanding the billing size of 30 existing customers to $ 50 million each from $10 million at present. FINANCIALS Revenue increased at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23% over the last three years with stable margin at 17%. In the past two years, it paid 80% of its net profit as dividend.The return on equity (RoE) is 38%, which is superior to mid-sized and large-sized IT Services companies.Revenue per employee of the company is $50,000, compared with that of peers at $45,000-46,000. VALUATION Considering 10% and 12% expected revenue growth in dollar terms with a flat margin for FY17 and FY18, the compa ny will be valued at 16 times the FY18 earnings.This is more than the valuation of some of the top and mid-sized IT services companies. In addition, the asking market capitalisation of L&T Technology services is 1.7 times that of Cyient despite having similar revenue base. Cyient earns nearly 68% of revenue from ERD with a margin of 13%. Its client base includes Boeing, Airbus and IBM among others. Based on the higher-end of the offer price, L&T Technology demands a premium of 60% to its peer Cyient on market cap. Given such a high asking valuation and subdued market sentiment for technology stocks, long-term investors may wait for the secondary market buy instead of participating in the initial offer.

I find it hard to believe that all three of you have hardware failure though. Perhaps corruption of the OS? Try SFC /scannow Obviously DDU, (do so for the Intel and AMD categories as well) and reinstall the latest driver. I HIGHLY recommend stripping it of all garbage.

Ive seen something similar in Chrome sometimes in youtube videos, however it passes after 2-3 seconds of playback. And then again not on all videos.

Several research groups are now using the hugely popular game, which features fast cars and various nefarious activities, to train algorithms that might enable a self-driving car to navigate a real road. There’s little chance of a computer learning bad behavior by playing violent computer games. But the stunningly realistic scenery found in Grand Theft Auto and other virtual worlds could help a machine perceive elements of the real world correctly. A technique known as machine learning is enabling computers to do impressive new things, like identifying faces and recognizing speech as well as a person can. But the approach requires huge quantities of curated data, and it can be challenging and time-consuming to gather enough. The scenery in many games is so fantastically realistic that it can be used to generate data that’s as good as that generated by using real-world imagery. An image from Grand Theft Auto in which different elements have been automatically annotated. Some researchers already build 3-D simulations using game engines to generate training data for their algorithms (see “To Get Truly Smart, AI Might Need to Play More Video Games”). However, off-the-shelf computer games, featuring hours of photorealistic imagery, could provide an easier way to gather large quantities of training data. A team of researchers from Intel Labs and Darmstadt University in Germany has developed a clever way to extract useful training data from Grand Theft Auto. The researchers created a software layer that sits between the game and a computer’s hardware, automatically classifying different objects in the road scenes shown in the game. This provides the labels that can then be fed to a machine-learning algorithm, allowing it to recognize cars, pedestrians, and other objects shown, either in the game or on a real street. According to a paper posted by the team recently, it would be nearly impossible to have people label all of the scenes with similar detail manually. The researchers also say that real training images can be improved with the addition of some synthetic imagery. The software scans a road scene and assigns objects label names (on the left panel) such as road, sidewalk, or building. One of the big challenges in AI is how to slake the thirst for data exhibited by the most powerful machine-learning algorithms. This is especially problematic for real-world tasks like automated driving. It takes thousands of hours to collect real street imagery, and thousands more to label all of those images. It’s also impractical to go through every possible scenario in real life, like crashing a car into a brick wall at a high speed. “Annotating real-world data is an expensive operation and the current approaches do not scale up easily,” says Alireza Shafaei, a PhD student at the University of British Columbia who recently coauthored a paper showing how video games can be used to train a computer vision system, in some cases as well as real data can. Together with Mark Schmidt, an assistant professor at UBC, and Jim Little, a professor at UBC, Shafaei showed that video games also provide an easy way to vary the environmental conditions found in training data. “With artificial environments we can effortlessly gather precisely annotated data at a larger scale with a considerable amount of variation in lighting and climate settings,” Shafaei says. “We showed that this synthetic data is almost as good, or sometimes even better, than using real data for training.” AI researchers already use simple games as a way to test the learning capabilities of their algorithms (see “Google’s AI Masters Space Invaders” and “Minecraft Is a Testing Ground for Human-AI Collaboration”). But there is growing interest in using game scenery to feed algorithms visual training data. A group at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, for instance, is developing a tool that can be used to connect a machine-learning algorithm to any environment built using the popular game engine Unreal. This includes games such as KiteRunner and Hellblade, but also many spectacular architectural visualizations.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Biostar is off to the Mini-ITX races with its Z170GTN mobo by Jeff Kampman  3:26 PM on September 13, 2016 Mini-ITX PCs seem to be growing in popularity of late, but there aren't many of those tiny motherboards to choose from with Z170 chipsets. Biostar is throwing another option into the ring with its Z170GTN. This board, part of the company's premium "Racing" series, offers just about everything a Mini-ITX builder might want. It's got an M.2 2280 slot on its back side with four PCIe 3.0 lanes hooked up, an M.2 2230 connector for Wi-Fi cards, and the now-requisite RGB LED lighting on its chipset and VRM heatsinks. The Z170GTN's rear I/O cluster offers four USB 3.0 ports, HDMI and DVI outs, two USB 2.0 ports, and a PS/2 port for old-school gamers. Intel's I219V controller powers the board's built-in Gigabit Ethernet port. Some might miss the USB 3.1 Gen2 ports and USB Type-C connector that are absent from this board, though. A Realtek ALC892 codec powers 7.1 analog outputs and an S/PDIF optical output. Four SATA ports and a U.2 port round out the expansion options. If the RGB LEDs on board aren't enough, the Z170GTN has a header for controlling 5050 LED strips, as well. Biostar didn't offer pricing or availabilty info.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Extreme Why self-driving cars are drawing ever closer — except from Apple Why self-driving cars are drawing ever closer — except from Apple By Bill Howard on September 13, 2016 at 3:00 pm Comment In just a few short months, the future of self-driving grew clearer and closer. It was the result of shuffling alliances among automakers, sensor- and software-providers, and the most major (Tier One) automotive component suppliers. Automakers announced ambitious timing for autonomous driving. Uber announced it’s about to start testing self-driving cars in Pittsburgh. All this despite a late spring fatal crash of a Tesla running Autopilot. All this suggests we’ll probably see seriously self-driving cars within five years that you can buy or lease, and the luddites have a shortened time frame for complaining about the pending carnage. The lone outlier? Apple, which we’ll get to below. First, here’s a rundown of what’s happening. Upgrading Autopilot: seeing the world in radar https://t.co/WqJfyqpDXL — Tesla (@TeslaMotors) September 11, 2016 Tesla crash in Florida was the starting point A fatal accident May 7 in Florida was the first time a Tesla operating under Autopilot was involved in a fatal accident. This is the crash where the driver, Joshua Brown, had a portable DVD player in the car that may or may not have been playing at the time his Model S slammed into a tractor-trailer turning left across a divided highway. The Tesla’s optical sensors apparently did not recognize the light-colored finish of the trailer against a light sky. In July, Tesla parted ways with Mobileye, the supplier of the algorithms and microprocessors behind the optical sensors. It’s unclear who cut whom loose. Mobileye has said its current offerings weren’t meant to detect every vehicle sideways in front of the vehicle but its next-gen system, called EyeQ4, will when it arrives in 2018. Recently, Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed pending changes to improve the next version of Autopilot, 8.0, that shifts primary responsibility for checking the road from the optical camera in the windshield to the front-facing radar. The automatic, over-the-air update, should be ready soon. Safety agencies and Consumer Reports have dinged Tesla for allowing extended hands-off driving currently — and even for use of the term “Autopilot.” They fear the term emboldens drivers when it really is a limited system for pacing the car in front, staying in the center of lanes that aren’t too sharply curved, and responding to some incursions into the lane the Tesla is in. On its blog, Tesla said, in part: While there are dozens of small refinements with Version 8 of our software … the most significant upgrade to Autopilot will be the use of more advanced signal processing to create a picture of the world using the onboard radar. The radar was added to all Tesla vehicles in October 2014 as part of the Autopilot hardware suite, but was only meant to be a supplementary sensor to the primary camera and image processing system. After careful consideration, we now believe it can be used as a primary control sensor without requiring the camera to confirm visual image recognition. This is a non-trivial and counter-intuitive problem, because of how strange the world looks in radar. Photons of that wavelength travel easily through fog, dust, rain and snow, but anything metallic looks like a mirror. The radar can see people, but they appear partially translucent. Something made of wood or painted plastic, though opaque to a person, is almost as transparent as glass to radar. Tesla will also use fleet learning, meaning if there’s an object that on or near the road that might be mistaken by radar for a stopped car or other hazard (a soda can with its concave bottom facing the oncoming car could do that, Tesla says), and several cars (Teslas) safely drive past the object, it will be added to a whitelist of objects that can be ignored via Tesla’s telematics. Obviously the whitelist learning would work even better if all semi-self-driving cars shared this information, either via telematics or via vehicle-to-vehicle DSRC, or dedicated short range communications. Tesla said it will even bounce the radar off the road and under the car immediately in front to see two cars ahead. This is something Nissan has been doing with its look-ahead or predictive adaptive cruise control (image below) back in 2014 on vehicles such as the then-new Nissan Murano. Most cars with semi-autonomous driving in the form of lane centering assist warn hands-off drivers to take hold of the wheel after about 10 seconds and suspend lane-centering assist about five seconds later. Tesla’s tough love adjustment, according to The New York Times, now will be that at highway speeds (45 mph and up), hands-off drivers will be “warned after a few minutes, and more frequently if the road turns or curves, or if there are other cars on the road ahead.” Schematic: Nissan look-ahead adaptive cruise control A wave of new alliances Automakers have been working overtime to sew up alliances with suppliers of the components and algorithms for self-driving, and the separately functioning modules that pass for simpler assisted driving today: adaptive cruise control, emergency braking; lane keep assist and its predecessor lane departure warning; and blind spot assist. Automakers that so far have projected self-driving cars within five years or less include Ford, General Motors, and Fiat Chrysler (FCA). This would mean a so-called Level 4 car, or one that can operate without a licensed driver in the car, quite possibly with no steering wheel or foot controls. Three companies with strengths in vision systems are Autoliv, Mobileye, and Nvidia. Autoliv and Volvo cars this month announced a joint venture to autonomous driving software. Intel this month bought the startup Movidius which specializes in machine vision. It’s a supplier to others higher up on the food chain such as FLIR (night vision sensors for cars, planes, and spies), DJI (drones), Google (self-driving car systems) and Lenovo. Delphi, the former parts division of GM, and Mobileye entered into a partnership that would provide an autonomous driving solution that a (likely smaller) automaker could put in their cars as soon as late 2019, the two say. Not wanting to be dependent on Google for maps, BMW, Daimler AG (ie Mercedes-Benz), and Volkswagen’s Audi unit bought the HERE real-time maps company that began as Navteq. Automakers are also buying into ancillary technology companies that know about ride-sharing, for the time when self-driving cars are real. BMW’s iVentures subsidiary, for instance, bought into RideCell, a ride-booking firm in Seattle. Uber Pittsburgh will have self-driving cars, with drivers Uber this week plans to begin a limited test in Pittsburgh of self-driving cars that will pick up and chauffeur passengers. Since it’s still early for a truly self-driving car, one so good it wouldn’t need a steering wheel, there will still be an Uber driver behind the steering wheel. Uber has announced alliances with Volvo, which will provide the modified Volvo XC90 SUVs for the aforementioned Pittsburgh test. It also bought the startup company Otto for Uber-level chump change ($700 million) and acquired a host of talent in robotics and autonomous driving, specializing in trucks. While truckers (some) sniff at the idea an 80,000-pound vehicle being auto-piloted, much of their driving is on interstates with mostly gentle curves. One concept is a lead vehicle with a driver (also lane center, adaptive cruise) and a dozen or more autonomous trucks following behind (with, yes, enough distance between them that cars would be locked out of the right lane). Uber chose Pittsburgh because of the strong robotics and autonomous driving at Carnegie Mellion and for the state’s relatively open stance on testing self-driving cars, which to critics and skeptics means “life-threatening.” But Apple pulls back on self-driving cars Every trend line has a few outlier data points. In this case it’s Apple, which is reconsidering its unannounced plans (Project Titan) to create self-driving cars. According to a Friday story by The New York Times: In a retrenchment of one of its most ambitious initiatives, Apple has shuttered parts of its self-driving car project and laid off dozens of employees, according to three people briefed on the move who were not allowed to speak about it publicly. The job cuts are the latest sign of trouble with Apple’s car initiative. The company has added resources to the project — code-named Titan — over the last two years, but it has struggled to make progress. And in July, the company brought in Bob Mansfield, a highly regarded Apple veteran, to take over the effort. Apple may have had a change of heart: Initially, it wanted to create and build an entire self-driving car, most likely an electric vehicle. Over time, it reportedly wondered if that was the company’s core competence. The pullback indicates Apple might fall back to creating the self-driving hardware and algorithms in conjunction with hardware providers, and sell that to automakers. At the same time, Apple has a mass of loyal phone-notebook-tablet-watch buyers who’d be inclined to put an Apple car on their shortlist. The Apple name might provide (initially) a price premium. It may also be that Apple had a hard time matching up with automakers who’d be willing to create a hardware platform (the car body, interior, and suspension) for Apple. Apple is widely reported to have approached both BMW and Daimler to work together. Apple visited BMW’s i3 factory in Leipzig, Germany, to see first-hand how the car was made. Reports this past spring say BMW and Daimler both declined to move forward because of disagreements over how much control they’d have. Reports at the time said that Apple could still link up with Magna Steyr, a Canadian-Austrian contract manufacturer of cars.

Image: Eidos Montreal Video Games Are So Realistic That They Can Teach AI What the World Looks Like Written by Jordan Pearson Staff Writer (Canada) September 13, 2016 // 01:58 PM EST Copy This URL Thanks to the modern gaming industry, we can now spend our evenings wandering around photorealistic game worlds, like the post-apocalyptic Boston of Fallout 4 or Grand Theft Auto V’s Los Santos, instead of doing things like “seeing people” and “engaging in human interaction of any kind.” Games these days are so realistic, in fact, that artificial intelligence researchers are using them to teach computers how to recognize objects in real life. Not only that, but commercial video games could kick artificial intelligence research into high gear by dramatically lessening the time and money required to train AI. “If you go back to the original Doom, the walls all look exactly the same and it’s very easy to predict what a wall looks like, given that data,” said Mark Schmidt, a computer science professor at the University of British Columbia (UBC). “But if you go into the real world, where every wall looks different, it might not work anymore.” Read More: Why Artificial Intelligence Researchers Love 'Super Mario Bros.' Schmidt works with machine learning, a technique that allows computers to “train” on a large set of labelled data—photographs of streets, for example—so that when let loose in the real world, they can recognize, or “predict,” what they’re looking at. Schmidt and Alireza Shafaei, a PhD student at UBC, recently studied Grand Theft Auto V and found that self-learning software trained on images from the game performed just as well, and in some cases even better, than software trained on real photos from publicly available datasets. “Video game graphics have actually gotten good enough that you can train on raw data and have it be almost as good as real-world data,” Schmidt continued. Of course, video games aren’t advanced enough to be indistinguishable from reality, and so real images are still preferred. But you can cull so many labelled images from games that their sheer number makes up for the lack of detail in individual images. Because popular machine learning databases like Cityscapes and CamVid only contain images captured in European cities, games that realistically render North American locales can also help AI broaden its horizons. Grand Theft Auto V. Image: Rockstar Games “For example, European streets are narrower than streets in North America,” said Stephan Richter, a PhD student at Technische Universität Darmstadt in Germany, who also studies computer vision. “If you train AI on German streets and try to use it on North American streets, it might not perform as well as if you’d had the proper training data. Video games allow researchers to create labelled images much more quickly than when they work with real photos. When presented with a photo from a real street, researchers have to manually label every object on the screen so the computer knows what it’s looking at. This is a process that can take many hours, and time is money. But video game code always “knows” what’s on-screen, and so essentially the images are pre-labelled for researchers. All it takes is some software that can intercept the commands a game sends to the computer’s graphics hardware, since the source code for games themselves is protected by studios. Hitman. Image: Io-Interactive “We realized that because the game already knows what a car is and where it appears again in another frame, then we have the label already made and we can streamline the annotation process,” said Richter. “We can massively annotate other frames when we see a 3D object again.” Richter and a team of researchers from Technische Universität Darmstadt and Intel Labs recently published a paper on this approach and found that labelling a single image culled from Grand Theft Auto V took seven seconds on average. Manually labelling real-world images, on the other hand, took anywhere from an hour to 90 minutes—a massive drop in both work time and money spent paying people to do the work. Off-the-shelf video games like Grand Theft Auto, Hitman, and the Chicago-set Watch Dogs—just a couple examples from the team’s paper—offer enough realism and detail to potentially revolutionize machine learning research. Research teams may not have the time or money to manually label real-world images or generate a realistic 3D simulation of their own, and so games can step in to fill the resource gap. But in order to make it really work, Richter said, game developers need to be open with researchers and collaborate on machine learning work. “Games have become so realistic in terms of visual quality and the speed at which you can render photorealistic images that it’s totally interesting to open up game engines for machine learning work,” said Richter. “It would be interesting if game manufacturers actually let us use their worlds.” In an AI-saturated future, it might just be a selling point that a new game is so realistic that even a computer will dig it.

By Rex Crum | rcrum@bayareanewsgroup.com PUBLISHED: September 13, 2016 at 10:32 am | UPDATED: September 13, 2016 at 3:17 pm MILPITAS — The recent slate of tech-industry acquisitions around the Bay Area continued Tuesday as Intersil, a maker of semiconductors used in industrial and automotive applications, agreed to be acquired for $3.2 billion by Japanese chipmaker Renesas . The deal comes as Renesas is seeking to expand beyond its traditional analog signal-processing chips into the automotive field, which is itself taking on the look of a gold rush as many chipmakers are rushing to get in on the market for smart cars and self-driving car technology. Milpitas-based Intersil specializes in semiconductors that are used to manage how power is used in industrial products, while Renesas’ main products process signals from sound and light, which are then converted into digital signals for use in home electronics, office automation and automotive applications. The all-cash deal values Intersil at $22.50 a share, or almost 14 percent more than Intersil’s Monday closing price of $19.76.a share. The deal is expected to close during the first half of 2017. On a conference call to discuss the acquisition, Necip Sayiner, Intersil’s chief executive, said that because there is little overlap between Intersil’s and Renesas’ products, the companies’ technologies “are highly complementary” and that the automotive market, in particular, represents a “clear future” for both chipmakers to pursue. Sayiner said that Intersil wasn’t looking to get acquired when Renesas approached the company about an acquisition earlier this year. However, Sayiner admitted that the nature of the chip industry has made it so that Intersil felt it had to team up with another chip leader in order to remain relevant in the market. “In a consolidating industry, it was unlikely that Intersil would continue to exist in its current form,” Sayiner said. “As part of Renesas, we will be able to build on our product and technological strengths.” The deal for Intersil comes amid what has been an active summer for acquisitions among leading Bay Area tech companies. On Monday, HP said it would acquire Samsung Electronics’ printing business for $1.05 billion. Last week, Intel spun off its cybersecurity business in a deal with TPG, and in August, Tesla Motors agreed to acquire Solar City for $2.6 billion. Additionally, Intel formed a partnership with BMW and Mobileye to build a platform for self-driving cars, and Nvidia made a similar move with Chinese internet giant Baidu. Rob Enderle, technology industry analyst with the Enderle Group, said Renesas’ buying of Intersil is indicative of the importance for chip companies to get into new products for the automotive industry. “There is a huge rush to own the automotive market as cars become more like computers,” Enderle said. “Both Renesas and Intersil have strong positions in the market though Renesas is stronger in Asia and Intersil stronger in most of the rest of the world. Enderle said Renesas has also likely been seeing pressure from Intel, Nvidia and Qualcomm, which necessitated the company making a big splash acquisition in the automotive sector. “Assuming Renesas doesn’t break Intersil, which is an iffy assumption given more acquisitions fail than succeed, the combination should create a much stronger automotive focused powerhouse,” he said.

Resend activation e-mail Infinite Loop / The Apple Ecosystem iOS 10 is a pleasant surprise for the iPhone 5 and 5C 2012's hardware is still up to the task of running 2016's software. by Andrew Cunningham - Sep 13, 2016 6:10 pm UTC Login to bookmark 118 Enlarge / The iPhone 5 running iOS 10. Andrew Cunningham I’ve been tracking the performance of new iOS versions on the slowest supported hardware for four years now, and I don’t think my findings have been positive since I wrote about iOS 6 on the iPhone 3GS. iOS 7 was a bad fit for the iPhone 4, and iOS 7.1 was only an improvement in a relative sense. iOS 8 and iOS 9 were tolerable on the iPhone 4S, but they were still significant slowdowns compared to iOS 6 and 7. But we have some reason to be optimistic about iOS 10 on the iPhone 5. The phone is more than twice as fast as the 4S and has double the RAM. Its screen is the same size and resolution as the one in the just-launched iPhone SE, so you know that Apple and all other app developers are still fine-tuning their apps for it. So how enthusiastic should iPhone 5 and 5C owners be about iOS 10? Can you get the new features without worrying about a slowdown, or should you give Apple some more time to optimize (or more money for another phone)? What you’re missing Every time a new iPhone is released, it does some stuff that previous iPhones couldn’t do. Sometimes that just means going faster, and sometimes that means the addition of special hardware like a fingerprint sensor or NFC chip. Here’s a combination of all the hardware and software features the iPhone 5 is missing relative to the iPhone 6S, not including processor benchmarks or camera improvements. TouchID and Apple Pay 3D Touch Voicemail transcription New Photos app features like Memories, Related, People, and Scene Night Shift Safari content blockers Raise-to-wake Step tracking without external hardware like an Apple Watch Burst photos and slow-mo video 64-bit and Metal API support. That’s a not-insignificant list of things, but it’s also much shorter than the list for iPhone 4S with iOS 8 and 9. The iPhone 5 can do all of the Airdrop and Handoff stuff, and it supports the Apple Watch as well as all of iOS 10’s headlining APIs and app improvements. Performance and battery life: iOS 9-ish Comparing app launch times has historically been a reliable way to measure relative performance—it’s not the best, most all-encompassing real-world test, but the odds are good that if app launch times slow way down, the rest of the phone will feel slower as well. Luckily, most apps in iOS 10 launch about as quickly as they did in iOS 9, reflecting the fact that iOS 9 and iOS 10 mostly run similarly. As always, these tests were run on freshly-reset phones signed into a test iCloud account. Each app was launched, force quit, and then launched again. The times below are the average of three launches.  Application iOS 9.3.5 iOS 10.0.1 GM Change Safari 1.55 seconds 1.77 seconds  +14% Camera 1.03 seconds 1.05 seconds  +2% Settings 1.02 seconds 1.05 seconds  +3% Mail 1.17 seconds 1.66 seconds  +42% Messages 1.45 seconds 1.72 seconds  +18.5% Calendar 1.04 seconds 0.97 seconds  -7% Cold boot 37.1 seconds 37.3 seconds  +0.5% For Camera, Settings, Calendar, and the boot process, these times are so close that most users won't notice a difference, and both Safari and Messages also manage to come pretty close. Mail is the only app that sees a modest slowdown with iOS 10 similar to the way most apps slowed down when the iPhone 4S jumped to iOS 8. In absolute terms all of these changes are small, and there is no sign of the across-the-board slowdown we saw on the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S when they were updated to iOS 7 and iOS 8, respectively. You don't lose the feeling of general responsiveness and fluidity throughout the OS, something that's harder to measure with a stopwatch but which definitely contributed to the slowdown on those older devices. Relative battery life is about the same too, though for reasons we’ll explore later the iPhone 5 can’t last as long as newer iPhones can running the same software. These numbers are encouraging, but I also used the iPhone 5 as my main phone for a couple of days to get a sense of how it actually feels to use iOS 10 on it. Again, it’s mostly good news, at least if you’re happy with how the phone runs iOS 9. Using the phone in real life Most basic day-to-day things still feel pretty good on the iPhone 5. Bringing up the Intelligence screen, the Notification Center, the Control Center, or the multitasking switcher all happens smoothly without the inconsistency or dropped frames that plague an iPhone 4S running iOS 9. You’ll mostly run into problems in three areas: games, multitasking, and battery life. The GPU in the iPhone 5S can be as much as three or four times faster than the GPU in the iPhone 5, and newer iPhone GPUs are even faster. That by itself is enough to explain why even simple-looking games like Pokémon Go and Shooty Skies can exhibit choppy framerates on the iPhone 5. They’re still playable, but performance is less consistent since the hardware is being pushed to its limits. The same principle explains why multitasking—switching from one app to another, replying to a message directly from a notification, doing things with the phone while it’s also performing a background task like app updating or a large download—can make the phone chug a little. As long as you’re just doing one thing, the speed feels pretty good. The iPhone 5 launched with iOS 6, after all, software that was far more locked down and less capable than iOS is today. And then there's battery life. Part of the problem stems from the older hardware—if the SoC is working harder than it did under older versions of iOS, that means that the chip spends less time idling, and idle time is where modern phones and laptops save power. The biggest battery life jumps in recent years have come because Apple, Intel, and others have figured out how to let their chips spend more time not doing anything and by making the processors switch between active and idle states more quickly. The iPhone 5 and 5C are working harder more often, so battery life is more of a problem than it is on a newer phone like the iPhone SE (that phone’s chips were all made using newer, more power-efficient manufacturing processes, which also helps). The other factor is normal wear-and-tear. Any iPhone 5 or 5C out there right now is somewhere between two and four years old, and if your phone’s battery hasn’t been replaced at some point, you’ve probably lost a significant amount of capacity. Since those phones are also mostly out of warranty, it’s relatively easy to find a third-party who will change your battery out for a fresh one, and iFixit sells kits that make it relatively easy to do yourself. But if you or someone you know is using an older iPhone 5 or 5C at this point, a new battery is probably worth looking into. The most important thing to note for the purposes of this article is that all of these things were also problems in iOS 9, and that iOS 10 doesn’t appear to make any of them worse. They’re just realities of using a phone made in 2012 to run software made in 2016. Phone hardware is maturing rapidly, but the year-over-year improvements are still noticeable, and cumulatively the last four years of updates are even more noticeable. Should you update? For the first time in a while, I’m comfortable recommending the latest version of iOS for the oldest-supported iPhone without major caveats or qualifications. Yes, newer iPhones are faster and can do more things, but if you’re still using an iPhone 5 or 5C (or if you’ve handed your old one down to someone else in your circle of family and friends), iOS 10 will treat the hardware about the same as iOS 9 did—not bad, given that the iPhone 5 is four years old. I’ve always been frustrated by the “forced obsolescence” argument with respect to iPhones and iPads, and the fact that iOS 10 runs pretty well on the iPhone 5 makes it even more silly than it normally is. There is, to put it quite simply, no other company on Earth who is providing this kind of support for its phones. Not one. How many years has it been since Samsung even thought about the Galaxy S III? The HTC One X didn’t even make it two years. Microsoft ditched the Lumia 920 with the Windows 10 update despite promises that all Windows Phone 8 phones would be supported. Even Google won’t commit to keeping a phone around and up-to-date for more two years. And it’s getting to the point where any given Android phone maker couldn’t keep hardware updated for more than two or three years even if it wanted to. iOS 10 treats the iPhone 5 pretty well, and I would expect this to gradually become the new “normal” as the gap between the newest, best iPhone and the slowest, oldest supported iPhone continues to narrow. Huge performance gains will get harder to come by as the smartphone settles into its boring middle age and as manufacturing smaller, more power-efficient chips becomes more difficult, and as a result your hardware should stop feeling old quite so quickly. Our full iOS 10 review will be published later this afternoon. Expand full story Reader comments 118 You must login or create an account to comment.

To get this column each market day, click here. Broadly speaking, the September downdraft has inflicted damage against a still distinctly technical U.S. market backdrop. Consider that the S&P 500 and Dow industrials have effectively nailed major support — around S&P 2,117 and Dow 18,000 — areas that remain an immediate bull-bear battleground. Before detailing the U.S. markets’ wider view, the S&P 500’s SPX, -0.21%  hourly chart highlights the past two weeks. As illustrated, the S&P’s price action remains technical. The index has thus far bottomed at 2,119 — matching the 2,117 support — before rising to close at 2,159, matching the breakdown point. These areas remain inflection points. The bear case strengthens on a violation of support, while a close atop resistance would neutralize the September downdraft. Similarly, the Dow industrials’ DJIA, -0.19%  backdrop remains technical. In its case, the index has bottomed near the 18,000 mark, before rising to resistance matching the 2015 peak of 18,351. Recall that the 18,000 area matches significant support, better illustrated on the daily chart. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite’s backdrop remains slightly stronger. Consider that it tagged all-time highs just last week, and had reclaimed the breakdown point at Monday’s close. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq has maintained next support closely matching the 5,100 mark. From current levels, the breakdown point — technically Nasdaq 5,186 — remains an area to track. The index closed Monday higher, but has reversed to less-charted territory with Tuesday’s early downturn. A sustained posture atop the breakdown point would place the brakes on bearish momentum. Looking elsewhere, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has maintained significant support closely matching the 18,000 mark — at least so far. Recall that resistance matches the 2015 peak of 18,351, illustrated on the hourly chart, and is followed by the 50-day moving average, currently 18,424. Similarly, the S&P 500 has maintained its breakout point. Recall that significant support spans from 2,117 to 2,120, illustrated above, and matching the March and November 2015 peaks. The bigger picture Broadly speaking, the September downdraft has inflicted damage, though the market price action remains technical. To start, each widely-tracked benchmark has closely observed its first notable support — the S&P 2,117, Dow 18,000 and Nasdaq 5,100 areas. Moreover, the S&P 500 and Dow industrials have subsequently reversed almost precisely to their respective breakdown points — the S&P 2,160 and Dow 18,350 areas. Against this backdrop, the SPDR Trust S&P 500’s SPY, -0.21% six-month chart includes volume. Not surprisingly, the recent whipsaw has been fueled by a volume spike, though the SPY has thus far maintained its breakout point, around 212.50. The September low currently rests at 212.31, and this area remains an inflection point. Perhaps more notably, recent market breadth has pressed, or flat out registered, technical extremes. Recall that Friday’s negative breadth was firmly bearish. Declining volume surpassed advancing volume by a 27-to-1 margin on the NYSE, and an 11-to-1 margin on the Nasdaq. This was followed by Monday’s respectable, but internally weaker, rally. The session registered as a nearly 6-to-1 up day on the NYSE, and a nearly 7-to-1 up day on the Nasdaq. As always, two 9-to-1 down days, across about a seven-session window, reliably signals a material trend shift. The first has registered, and the follow-through, or lack thereof, ahead of the Federal Reserve’s policy directive, due out next Wednesday (not this week), may add color. Tactically, recall that the S&P 500’s former range bottom — the 2,160 area — pivots to resistance. The S&P effectively nailed this area Monday, and has failed the initial retest. An eventual close higher would place the brakes on bearish momentum. Conversely, the 2,131 area marks an inflection point, and is closely followed significant support at the 2,117 breakout point. The September closing low rests at 2,128, while the absolute September low holds at 2,119. More broadly, technical damage has been inflicted, and a near-term consolidation phase is underway. Still, the S&P 500’s more important longer-term technical bias supports a bullish view. The “watch out” is that a second internally aggressive downdraft, over the next week, sends the S&P 500 under the 2,117 support. Such a move would signal a sustained momentum shift, raising the flag to more serious technical concerns. Tuesday’s Watch List The charts below detail names that are technically well positioned. These are radar screen names — sectors or stocks poised to move in the near term. For the original comments on the stocks below, see The Technical Indicator Library. Drilling down further, the 10-year Treasury note yield’s TNX, +2.46% breakout has contributed to the broad-market downdraft. As illustrated, the yield has knifed from its range, reaching its highest levels since June 23, the day before Brexit. Still, it’s thus far topped at 1.70, matching the breakdown point. This area is followed by the 200-day moving average, currently 1.80, and resistance at 1.98, better illustrated on the weekly chart. Collectively, the yield’s recovery attempt remains underway, though significant hurdles rest slightly overhead, and its longer-term technical bias points lower. Charting the traditional U.S. sector leaders Meanwhile, the traditional sector leaders — the financials, technology sector and transports — have thus far weathered the September volatility spike. To start, the Financial Select Sector SPDR XLF, +0.07% has maintained its breakout point, an area closely matching the 50-day moving average, currently 23.75. Moreover, the initial rally from support was fueled by increased volume. The group’s technical bias points higher barring a violation of the breakout point. Meanwhile, the iShares Transportation Average’s IYT, +0.37%  backdrop is slightly weaker. Still, the group has maintained first support, punctuating a garden-variety pullback from the range top. This is a developing head-and-shoulders bottom, though the pattern would be wrecked with a violation of the August low. Looking elsewhere, the PowerShares QQQ ETF QQQ, -0.22% a proxy for large-cap technology, has rattled its new range amid a volume spike. As illustrated, the group has maintained next support, rising to retest the breakdown point. This is a bullish reversal, though follow-through is absent early Tuesday. Separately, consider that the range bottom roughly matches the 50-day moving average, and is followed by a deeper floor matching the April peak. Combined, the sub-sector backdrop has softened amid the September downdraft, though the technical damage, on balance, has thus far been limited. Finally, the Energy Select Sector SPDR XLE, +0.78%  is acting well despite persistent crude-oil price volatility. The group tagged a 52-week high last week — by a penny — and has subsequently pulled in, maintaining the breakout point. More broadly, the group is challenging significant resistance, illustrated on the weekly chart, and a breakout likely opens the path to material follow-through. The September low closely matches the 50-day moving average, and a violation would raise a caution flag.

However on August 31, the Russian Defense Ministry confirmed Russia’s Su-34 fighter-bombers killed up to 40 Islamic State militants in the southern ranges of Aleppo, including Al-Adnani. The Pentagon claimed it had no information on whether Russia had targeted a second-in-command of the Islamic State. Reuters even cited one of the US defense officials who was "speaking on condition of anonymity", as saying that "Russia's claim is a joke". Russian experts however explained why Russia's version is the more likely one. "According to the Pentagon, Abu Muhammad Al-Adnani was killed in one of the districts of Al Bab to the north-east of Aleppo," Anton Mardasov, the head of the Department of Middle Eastern Conflicts of the Moscow-based Institute for Innovative Development told Russian online newspaper Vzglyad. The political analyst further said that the Islamists are fleeing the city as the Turks have every intention to take the city to be able to finally "shut down the Kurdish project." After the Turks launched their "Euphrates Shield" operation, the militants who were stationed around the city of Jarabulus, have moved to Al Bab. Earlier the Kurds wanted to unite their cantons through this particular city, he said. Ministry of defence of the Russian Federation Russian Su-34 Bombs Daesh Meeting, Killing Up to 40 Fighters in Syria's AleppoThe expert explained that according to his information, the senior Daesh strategist and number two in the group was killed while shooting his latest propaganda film. However there are reports that he could have been killed during an airstrike on the militants' position in another district of Aleppo.  The expert also mentioned that the Pentagon claimed Al-Adnani was killed in a Predator drone attack. Mardasov said that according to the Russian version, the terrorist was killed during Russia's airstrike on the Ma'arat Umm Hawsh, a village in northern Aleppo Governorate. "It is a settlement to the west of Al Bab, on the outskirts of the town of Маrеа. On August 30-31 the Kurds launched an assault of the town. According to some trustworthy sources, Russia's airspace forces have been providing aerial coverage to the Kurdish assault. Hence there are chances that Al-Adnani was killed on August 30 as the result of these airstrikes," the expert said. Semen Bagdasarov, director of the Center for Middle Eastern and Central Asian Studies told the newspaper that besides the fact that Russia, unlike the US, always provides video evidence of its airstrikes, there is another factor which allows to believe that the Russian version is more trustworthy. © AP Photo/ SITE Intel Group Daesh Leader and Spokesman Reportedly Killed in Syria’s Aleppo"The thing is that the major military operations against Daesh are taking place around Aleppo, with the aerial support of the Russian airspace forces," he said. "It is only logical to suppose that the high-ranking Daesh commander has been in that particular district then," he said. Bagdasarov also noted that Al-Adnani, Syrian by origin, was not simply a high-ranking Daesh militant but was in command of the military operations on the Syrian territory. "The Americans therefore claim that he was killed in another district, closer to the Turksih border, while there was absolutely no need for him to be there.Hence the geography and logic speak in favor of the Russian version," he explained. Anton Mardasov however said that there are alternative points of view. First, he said, Al-Adnani could have been killed by the Kurds, however it remains unclear what the Daesh strategist "might have lost" in the city which has been under active attack of the Kurdish forces. "On the other hand, there were reports of high-ranking Daesh commanders having been killed at the front line," he said. Secondly, the Islamists often stage their deaths to cover up their traces and this might have been the case with Al-Adnani. © Flickr/ thierry ehrmann The Reality is Daesh Doesn’t Even Know of the Attacker Until After the Attack"More frequent reports on the deaths of Daesh commanders speak in favor of this version," he said. Not long before the elimination of Al-Adnani there were reports that about 80 Daesh militants had been killed by the international coalition. It might be true, he said, as after that the Islamists started experiencing losses but at the same time there were reports that some of the "eliminated commanders" were, in fact, alive. And finally, Al-Adnani might have been killed as the result of internal Daesh conflict, he suggested. "Such information was spread by the militants themselves," he said. It was reported that he was killed not by an airstrike but after his personal car was blown up. The expert suggested that it might also have been true, taking into account the internal challenges within the Islamic State. According to the expert, such a variety of narratives demonstrates that even though there are some agreements there is no strict coordination of activities between the sides to the Syrian conflict. "In fact, everyone is striking whoever he wants and it results in such incidents where it is absolutely unclear what has happened and who was behind it," he finally stated. ...

Home About Channels Calendar Tag Cloud Sign In Search Mozilla Being Human in a Data-Filled World with Genevieve Bell of Intel In May, Kevin Kelly shared the possibilities that technology will offer us over the next 30 years. Not addressed were some of the unintended consequences of this progress. Facebook Live, Snapchat and Pokemon Go provide a few examples of how tech is outpacing our ability to socially (and legally) master it. Innovation unchecked can pose serious challenges to our very humanity. Best practices for user research and focusing on specific use cases have limited impact on our ability to shape the future we want. Dr. Genevieve Bell is responsible for corporate sensing and insights at Intel. She leads a cross-discipline foresights community that delivers insights into significant societal, technical and global trends. At Mozilla she will deliver what she terms “more of a meditation and conversation than a talk” on what it means to proactively preserve our humanity in a world that is increasingly digital. This sounds high level but it is also practical: we will learn about five things that don not change and five things that do, and how paying close attention to them will help us be successful.

Improvements, New Extension Hit Mesa Written by Michael Larabel in Mesa on 13 September 2016 at 08:41 AM EDT. 29 Comments There has already been more improvements hitting Mesa Git this week. Among the noteworthy recent additions in Mesa Git include: - A RadeonSI change not to preload constants at the beginning of shaders. By doing so, very simple tests are seeing improvements -- a big decrease in SGPR spilling for shader-db tests by up to 68%. - OES_tessellation_shader is marked as done for OpenGL ES 3.2. OES_tessellation_shader is now exposed for all Mesa/Gallium3D drivers that expose the desktop ARB_tessellation_shader extension. - A ton of Intel blorp improvements. And nearly 100 other commits in the past 48 hours. A complete listing can be found via the Mesa Git log. Over on the mailing list are also more interesting patches, such as for AMD users is the potentially noteworthy "sub-allocation for small buffers" patches for the Radeon winsys. 29 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Cooler Boost Titan will limit the system’s temperature so that the latest CPU and GPU can demonstrate their maximum performance with no throttling. The latest ESS Sabre Hi-Fi Audio DAC delivers 16x more audio details into the headset than a regular CD. Push the limits of your audio peripherals and hear the difference with GT83VR.

It looks like they've still not changed that god damn horrible keyboard. The GT72 models are great except for the keyboard. It's a huge let down on a great line up.

Out of curiosity, what's wrong with the keyboard? I do a lot of traveling and was looking into this series.

It seems the keyboard will be too high or the "casing" around it seems too high.
