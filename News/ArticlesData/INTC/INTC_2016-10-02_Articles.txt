To be more specific it has nearly been a year since the last refresh, which means that it is possible that Apple could be announcing something soon, but could Best Buy have accidentally revealed what Apple has in store for the iMac refresh? Spotted on Best Buy’s website is a 27-inch iMac that is advertised as having an Intel Kaby Lake processor. Given that this Intel’s latest processor, it makes sense for Apple to include it in the refresh. However as pointed out by AppleInsider, there are some details that makes this listing a bit suspect. For example the price listed is $3,200, which makes it more expensive than the current iMacs with the same configuration which is priced at $3,150 on Apple’s website. It also lists its GPU as being the AMD Radeon R9 M380, which is odd since the current iMac features an AMD Radeon R9 M395, so obviously it doesn’t make sense for Apple to move backwards. In any case it is possible that maybe Best Buy is just using placeholder specs for its listing, hence the discrepancies. Apple is also rumored to be announcing new MacBook Pros later this month so perhaps we might get some iMac news as well, so stay tuned and check back with us at a later date for the details, if there any to be had.

And, you don’t have to read a thick manual or be ashamed to use the device.   This is the way wearable tech should always be, designed to enhance not only your capability but your appearance, be easy to use, and become something you are proud – rather than embarrassed – to wear.  The Oakley Radar Pace Like all things Oakley, Radar Pace are not only attractive glasses, they are really expensive glasses coming in at around $450.  The glasses contain Intel Real Speech, Bluetooth connectivity, internal sensors, and they are water resistant.   Intel Real Speech is a new conversational user interface that allows you to talk to the device and have it talk back to you.  Increasingly this will be the way we interact with devices and this apparently is what comes after products like Amazon Echo.   The internal sensors are accelerometer, gyroscope, pressure, humidity and proximity sensors.  These will tell the glasses just how hard you are working out, how fast you are going on your bike or snow skis, or how hard you are running.  This will enable the coach – either remote or digital – to keep track of your progress and provide timely and relevant advice.                      Image via Bigstock TOME Fashion Week The other products that showcased this week were largely from TOME.  Perhaps the most interesting was an attractive handbag, which could measure ambient temperature, barometric pressure, and toxic gasses.  I’m going to avoid the obvious function – to identify the person in an elevator who broke wind – and focus on the part where it could alert you to major changes in the weather in time to dig out an umbrella or run for some kind of cover.  Another TOME product was a leather bracelet that looks nothing like a typical digital exercise band yet has similar functionality.  This is very much like the new trend to make smartwatches actually look like watches because, as Apple found out, most folks apparently don’t want to wear an iPod Mini on their wrists no matter how capable it is.   Finally, they partnered with Baja East and Fila on connected shoes, which are likely a better place to put most excursive sensors than your wrist is.  For instance, when I’m using my Fitbit I find that when using a stationary bike or treadmill it works better stuffed in my sock than on my wrist because I don’t move my arms much.  Wrapping Up:  A Taste of What’s to Come I think this is just the beginning. While we haven’t yet figured out how to put tech into clothing that can be washed, this idea of concealing the tech behind designs as opposed to exposing it seems vastly more sustainable.  People, in general, at least for now, want solutions that are invisible and attractive; not really obvious and ugly and, of course, they want it to be both easy to use and easy to learn.  This next generation showcasing Intel’s Curie platform looks to be far closer to what the market is looking for than the stuff that has come before.  As a result, you will likely find a smartwatch, handbag, pair of shoes, or handbag that isn’t just helpful but also something that you can be proud to wear or carry.  Now that’s progress I can get behind.   However, we will need to make sure this stuff increasingly interoperates and doesn’t all try to talk at once.  I can imagine hell being a near constant argument or power play between all of your worn technical gear that could drift from just annoying all the way to intolerable pretty quickly.  Intel has made great progress in coverage now they need to drive interoperability to insure we aren’t driven insane by our warring wearable technology.    Edited by Maurice Nagle Author Info Rob Enderle President and Principal Analyst, Enderle Group Click here to read full bio SHARE THIS ARTICLE Tweet Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Related Articles Virtual vs. Real: Both Count When Selling By: Doug Mohney    11/16/2016 People have been predicting the end of "real" interaction to buy things for decades.

Intel Core i5 vs. Core i7: Which processor should you buy? By Joel Hruska on September 27, 2016 at 11:26 am Comment Whether you’re building your next PC or shopping for a new computer online, one of the questions that comes up from time to time is whether the Intel Core i5 or Core i7 is a better bargain. The short answer, “It depends,” isn’t all that helpful, so we’ve broken the data out in more detail and for both mobile and desktop processors. Here’s what you need to know. Desktop Core i5 vs. Desktop Core i7 Intel’s Skylake (6th generation) differentiation and feature sets haven’t really changed much since Haswell (4th generation). The Core i7 features quad-cores with Hyper-Threading enabled and Intel’s HD Graphics 530 solution. The Core i5 family offers quad-cores without Hyper-Threading, and either HD Graphics 530 or 510 GPUs. Most people, including gamers, should be fine with a Core i5 desktop CPU. Core i7 chips tend to help more with engineering, video editing, audio post-production, and other tasks that require as many processor threads as possible. For graphics, the HD Graphics 510 has 12 execution units (EUs), while the 530 has 24. Avoid the 510 in any case where you intend to do anything substantial with the GPU. But the long-standing rule of thumb remains true: No Intel chip is particularly strong in the graphics department, apart from the EDRAM-equipped Iris Pro variants (none of which exist in socketed consumer hardware). Enthusiast gamers should always opt for a discrete GPU. One significant difference between the desktop and mobile markets (the latter of which we’ll get to below) is how Intel positions Hyper-Threading. Almost all of  Intel’s desktop Core i5 chips across the last six desktop product generations are all quad-cores without Hyper-Threading, while its Core i7 family consists of quad-cores with Hyper-Threading. (Intel’s Core i5-4570T is the single exception to this — it’s a dual-core + Hyper-Threading chip.) Older Core i5 / Core i7 chips top out at 32GB of RAM, but Skylake raises this to 64GB for both types of processor. What about desktop PC performance? To compare performance between the Core i5 and Core i7 families, I turned to Anandtech’s excellent CPU Bench database. While AT doesn’t have records on every chip released by Intel or AMD, they’ve got a solid selection of comparable parts. I opted to check the Core i5-4690K versus the Core i7-4770K. The 4770K has Hyper-Threading, a base frequency of 3.5GHz, can Turbo up to 3.9GHz, and has 8MB of L3 cache. The Core i5-4690K has the same clock speed, but no Hyper-Threading and just 6MB of L3 cache. That’s about as perfect a match-up as you can ask for. The graph below was generated by comparing Core i5 and Core i7 in each and every benchmark and taking the geometric mean of the results. This diminishes the impact of outliers, though in this case, the arithmetic and geometric means are quite close to each other. I’ve split the data into three sections — general compute, gaming performance with 1x GTX 770, and gaming performance with the GTX 770 in SLI. Aggregate performance between the Core i5-4690K and Core i7-4770K. Data from Anandtech CPU bench There are some differences in the data sets that we need to discuss. The aggregate General Purpose ratio doesn’t reflect the impact Hyper-Threading can have on various applications. There are a number of applications where Hyper-Threading makes no difference, a handful where it decreases performance (though never by more than 8 percent) and a several benchmarks that show gains of 10-30%. If we set a 3% threshold for a tying score, Hyper-Threading gives the Core i7 a win in 21 out of 36 tests. It ties the Core i5 in 14 tests, and loses to it outright in just a single benchmark (x264). In workstation and consumer CPU workloads, Hyper-Threading sometimes helps a lot, sometimes doesn’t help much, but almost never hurts. Gaming, however, is a different animal. In gaming, Hyper-Threading never offers a single performance boost, while it impacted BioShock Infinite’s minimum FPS by 11% (meaning the Core i5 outscored the i7). The net effect is a 2% performance decrease for Hyper-Threading. In SLI gaming, we see a similar pattern, though this time it’s different games that take performance hits. The minimum frame rate for Sleeping Dogs was 10% faster on the Core i5 (56 vs. 61.8) and 5% faster in BF4 (86.4 vs. 82.9). What this means, in aggregate, is that while Hyper-Threading probably doesn’t hurt gaming in most titles, you can’t depend on it to offer a significant performance boost, either. While the above comparison uses older data from Haswell, there’s nothing about Skylake or Broadwell that changed the Core i5 / i7 comparison point. You can assume that the same metrics hold true for these chips as well — namely, that the Core i5 offers an equivalent level of performance. What about AMD? AMD isn’t a formal part of this article, but since I know people will ask, I took a look at how the FX-9590 compares against the Core i5-4690K. The news is not particularly good. There are a few well-threaded benchmarks where AMD can shine, including WinRAR, x265 encoding, multi-threaded Cinebench (both 11.5 and R15) and 7zip. The FX-9590 is utterly incapable of matching the 4690K’s single-threaded performance, which means AMD loses every test that can’t scale to eight cores or is single-threaded to start with. The gap between AMD and Intel in game benchmarks is much smaller than in general CPU performance. AMD’s FX-8350 and FX-9590 are capable of pushing perfectly acceptable frame rates. But the FX-9590 never outclasses the Core i5-4690K in any test. If you’re building a gaming box and you want to go AMD, you absolutely can — but pound for pound and watt for watt, the Core i5 wins this competition. Mobile Core i5 vs. Mobile Core i7  (Skylake, Kaby Lake) Mobile users now have three distinct choices to make, which clouds the issue a bit. There are previous-generation Core M chips as well as new Core i7 and i5 processors. The Core M chips are now limited to the m3 family — Intel has taken what used to be a distinct brand and folded it into the Core i7 and Core i5 families instead. This creates situations like the one shown below. These two chips look similar, with the same cache, almost the same clock speed, and similar GPUs — but they have different operating TDPs and hence offer different user experiences. Exactly how different isn’t something we can speak to without test hardware, but past systems showed marked variation depending on OEM design and thermal limits. To date, Core M hasn’t done particularly well — OEMs often saddled the processors with aggressive high-resolution displays and extremely thin chassis, leading to mediocre battery life. The Core i5 is in a similar situation: If you’re looking at the Core M-branded Core i5, we strongly recommend doing your homework and checking reviews of specific systems. Core M systems can deliver better battery life than their i5/i7 counterparts, but this will depend on the specifics of the manufacturer. Remember, high-resolution screens and ultra-thin systems with limited battery life will cost you just as much in power savings as you can get with a lower-TDP CPU — possibly more these days, since high-end chips account for a decreasing amount of power consumption. The other major difference we want to discuss is the newfound gap between Core i7 and i5 core counts on mobile. Prior to Skylake (6th gen), almost all Intel chips on mobile were dual-core below the Core i7 level. Now, there’s a group of Core i5 mobile parts that offer quad cores without Hyper-Threading support, as shown below: The difference between these three cores is that one of them supports Intel’s Iris Pro Graphics, while the other two are Intel HD Graphics-only. The Iris Pro 580 is Intel’s only EDRAM-equipped 128MB  Core i5. If you want a mobile processor with top-end graphics and a quad-core CPU, this is the Core i5 you want to purchase. Outside of these three cores, the general rule does still follow. Most mobile Core i5 and all Core i3 processors are dual-core with Hyper-Threading. Here are the features that separate mobile Core i5 and Core i7 processors: More cores: Many of Intel’s Core i7 processors are quad-core chips with Hyper-Threading enabled. This isn’t universal, however, and the company does offer a few dual-core + Hyper-Threading SKUs. Higher clocks: Intel’s dual-core mobile Core i7 chips typically have higher clock speeds than their Core i5 counterparts, even at the same TDP. More cache: Core i7 chips carry either 6MB or 4MB of cache. Core i5 chips run the gamut here. Older chips (pre-Broadwell) often carry 3MB, while Skylake and Kaby Lake chips are sometimes 4-6MB. The extra cache has only a small impact on performance. More addressable memory: Many older mobile Core i7 and i5 processors are limited to 16GB of memory, but there are Skylake (6th-gen) chips that support 32GB and even 64GB on some late Core i5 / i7 models. 16GB of RAM is fine for the vast majority of users. But if you think you might need more, check what your CPU is capable of at Intel’s database. How much performance you get out of a mobile Core i5 versus a Core i7 will depend a great deal on your laptop’s cooling solution and whether the chip can handle its own heat output. We’ve previously discussed how Intel gave OEMs more freedom to define their own TDP targets and skin temperatures. But this creates scenarios in which buying a faster Core M can actually result in worse performance, as the chip hits its thermal trip point and down-throttles to keep cool. Intel’s highest-end Iris Pro graphics are available in both Core i5 and Core i7 mobile SKUs We can’t point to specific instances where this has tilted performance between Core i5 and Core i7 chips, but it’s likely to create at least a little “slosh” between the two core families. Generally speaking, if you truly want to emphasize low power, pick the CPU that has lower base and turbo clocks. Intel historically defined TDP as “The CPU’s average power consumption when running typical workloads over a period of time.” A chip with more headroom is a chip that’ll hit its throttle point faster. Which chip should you buy? Right now at Newegg, Core i5 chips are running as low as $185 for the Haswell-based Core i5-4430, while the cheapest Skylake is $189 for the Core i5-6400. The Haswell is the better buy, with a 3GHz base clock, but the platform is older and you won’t be able to upgrade to a faster chip at a later date — assuming anyone still bothers. It’s a little surprising to see how much Haswell hardware is still in-channel. It’s been a year since Skylake launched and Intel normally turns its stock over fairly quickly. The cheapest Core i7 chip, in contrast, is $295 at Newegg for the Core i7-4770S, and there’s not much to recommend the Core i7 over the Core i5 family if you want to play games or do basic desktop work. The Core i7 can be faster, but many consumer applications top out around four threads. Many have hoped that AMD’s Zen will reinvigorate this market, but until that chip formally launches we’re stuck with the product roadmap Intel offers, and the Core i5 is the better deal for most people. Over a year ago, I wrote that DirectX 12 could offer the Core i7 a chance to prove itself, but we have yet to see that happen in the titles that have shipped to date. DirectX 11 and DX9 will remain important APIs for years to come, which means we have to wait and see which titles offer DX12 support and how it changes the Core i5-versus-Core i7 comparison. It’s harder to make this call on mobile. Poor cooling will cripple any laptop, and some of the boutique laptops on the market are sold with CPUs that they can’t possibly keep cool. I tend to favor the Core i5 over the Core i7 for mobile gaming because it helps preserve battery life and still offers good overall performance. CPU choice is just one element of a laptop — just be aware that higher-end CPUs may not deliver much of their expected performance if the chassis isn’t well designed for the chip it’s carrying. If you’re considering a laptop with a Kaby Lake or Skylake chip, as opposed to something older, I’d tend to go for the platform with the newest components and lower-resolution display if you want to maximize battery life, and the strongest GPU if you want to maximize gaming performance. The gap between Haswell and Skylake is irrelevant as far as gaming is concerned, while the difference between a GTX 970M and 960M is much larger.

Jeffrey Sickels I3’s do deliver. I’m still using a Sandy Bridge i3 2120 (3.3ghz) even for modern gaming. It’s been flying since early 2012. Kawaii Kurumi I agree i also have the i3 – 2100 but it does face some trouble when playing some games such as Far Cry 4 and all that and the PCI.E. is limited to generation 2 VirtualMark i7 if you can afford it. /article. close Even if you afford it it’s a waste of money if you don’t *need* it. You’re paying for something that you’re not using. Yes, you could argue that maybe you’ll need it in the future when it will spare you another upgrade and you may be right. But there are people using their computers in fixed scenarios and their performance needs won’t change until the next major OS upgrade which will come in the form of a new PC with new OEM license. Would you buy a 6-core i7 for your parents’ browsing machine just because you can afford it? Or would you stick to an i3-i5 because it’s already more than they’ll ever need? Crunchy005 Yep. For basic computer usage I would not buy anything over an i5 and I feel i3s are fine for that stuff, assuming a decent clock speed. Or even an AMD APU for that matter. The Hyperthreading is always nice but most gamers won’t use it that’s true, but lets be real here, gamers want the big core for benchmark numbers. I game and have the 4790k but I also have a minecraft server running in the background while I game and stuff so the extra threads are not a bad thing. Also the HT is really nice when i encode videos as well. Sunset Rider For basic computer usage you don’t even need anything above a Celeron, that’s what they’re for, basic computer usage. Buying an i5 would be overkill for basic usage, and it’s a waste of money because you don’t *need* it. MetusBatmanV3 You don’t need a large house, right? You don’t use every room in your house every moment of the day, right? You’re just wasting money because you don’t need the extra room, right? Why not build a house so the space is used all the time? Exactly, it makes zero sense because sometimes you need to do activities inside your house that requires more room than normal. Living in a tiny house isn’t the same as living in a house bigger than needed, right? That is why I buy a processor that can handle anything I’ll ever use it for, because I want to know that when the time comes I can complete the task in the least amount of time possible. Time is money, right? Lonnie Veal On point! But a lot of people, even techies, have unconsciously been co-opted by the Marketing Depts. i3 is slower than i5 is slower than i7 which is the best…because it costs the mostest? I regularly have arguments with staffers who insist they need an i7…even though all they are doing is regular office work…(I smile and tell them that if I Blocked all the Shopping websites, their i3 machine would operate even FASTER, BTW ;-) Paul Franklin Well said. Lonnie. I wish the Hardware industry had to abide by the same rules the canned food industry does… that is provide the price in terms of price/unit of speed. Not that I cant do the math. Usually the 80 20 rule applies, so buying the second tier product will provide the biggest ROI. MetusBatmanV3 Do you need a large house? No? So why are you complaining? Why not build a single room to live in? You can hush now. VirtualMark “Would you buy a 6-core i7 for your parents’ browsing machine just because you can afford it?” I’d tell them to buy the best CPU they can afford, it’s a fairly simple approach. The more powerful the system, the better the future proofing. Newer software tends to run slower on older systems, so I always like to get the best CPU for my budget. spoffle Afford and need aren’t the same thing. A lot of people could “afford” to go down the x99 route, but wouldn’t ever derive any benefit from doing so because they don’t push their hardware enough to make it a sensible choice. VirtualMark Nobody needs a computer for survival, all we need is oxygen, water and food. So what’s your point exactly? spoffle You know full well what my point is, don’t play dumb. Sunset Rider No he makes a good point, you don’t *need* anything faster than an 8 year old Core 2 Duo for basic web-browsing and Office. Actually you could get away with something even less powerful. spoffle This is exactly the point I’m making. VirtualMark You don’t have a point as far as I’m concerned. I could use DOS on an 80s computer if I wanted, but I work for a living and can afford a much more powerful machine. So I like to get the best CPU as I like to be able to run present and future software as smoothly as possible. spoffle You aren’t concerned at all, relative to my point, because you aren’t being sensible. There is a ratio of cost versus benefits, and for that vast majority of people who do very basic stuff with their PCs, by the time they actually needed the performance that a high end i7 offers, something new will be out that’s so much better that their i7 is long irrelevant in terms of the performance it offers. For example, look at how long a Q6600 stayed relevant in terms of the level of performance it offered versus what was necessary to perform basic tasks. With your method, most people are going to be wasting money. Joel Hruska The Q6600 was a damned good chip. Meaningfully good for years thanks to solid single-threading and fairly good scaling. I got one of the later G0 steppings and took it up to 3GHz. It wasn’t quite as fast as the Extreme Editions of the day, but it also cost a lot less. spoffle Most definitely, I ended up with a really good one that I could get to 4ghz. I actually got 5 years of use out of mine before I managed to sell it for a third of the price I bought it at. I’ve never known a CPU to deprecate so slowly. Matt Menezes My wife’s computer gets my hand-me-downs, and she has a Q6600 @ 2.8ghz (just because I didn’t want to raise voltage), 8GB DDR2, and a Radeon 6950 2GB. It can maintain 30FPS at 1080P with medium-high settings in most RPG games she likes (no ultra settings, no AA). Honestly, I can’t believe the legs the Q6600 has had – and to think that was the first quad-core CPU for consumers!! Joel Hruska I mean, there are now much faster CPUs — the Q6600 is probably about half the speed of a modern high-end Intel processor. But as far as longevity, yeah, that core was hard to beat. :) Matt Menezes Exactly. I could have spent hundreds upgrading the CPU, mobo, and RAM, but instead I jacked a bit of memory from a decommissioned computer at work and gave her decent hand-me-down GPUs whenever I upgraded mine. I didn’t want to spend money, I wanted to build a box for her with spare parts on a solid platform, and I’m just amazed that the thing is even relevant all these years later. cr1swell I’m still using my G0 Q6600, got it up to 3.915Ghz cpu-z validated as well. I’m still running my golden chip, but it’s finally showing it’s age. But for 175 bucks, this thing has done way more than I have paid for it. Maverick Leo I have 2 desktop that runs on Core 2 Quad 8600 on Intel board with 8Gb DDR2. It’s almost a decade old. When I bought it, it was for Photoshoping, Corel, Vegas other stuff, sans gaming. It already underwent several VCard, HDD and PSU replacement. And still working. I bought it for its power, and it never fails. My point here, future proofing can be relative, gladly I am already taking advantage of it. Four (4) years into service, Memory and CPU technology have gone too, far. There’s not much we can do. VCard might be upgraded but only few applications can took advantage of CUDA power that I USE in my shop. (e.g. CS6, Nero, MSO13, AutoCAD, Vegas, and a few free apps, thanx to Linux community). So, yes, you’re right. Buy computers for its intended purpose. Think a decade ahead, consider what module that will last into the future, and what needs replacement that will still be supported by then. Think SATA, PCI-E, etc. MetusBatmanV3 “benefits” is subjective, you clown. Get off your high horse and stop trying to dictate how other people spend their money. Spoffle Well you’ve completely misunderstood what I’ve said, so yeah, no. Huhster “but I work for a living and can afford” And yes we all get your point, but Spoffle still makes a very good point and you are just being childish and snarky in return. VirtualMark He makes the same tired point over and over again, and it all comes down to cost. Which was exactly my point – if you can afford the i7 then buy it. A faster computer is better than a slower one, end of story. And the rest of your comments don’t even deserve a reply, so I’d suggest that you conduct yourself like an adult if you wish to continue this discussion. Phobos I don’t know how can you be such a troll magnet yet it’s hilarious how you crush them with an ease . VirtualMark Lol it’s quite funny really. They all act smart, then start talking about cost, which just goes back to my original point. close Ok, maybe you weren’t the best example. I was thinking more of a person who can actually answer the question :). So it’s basically like you asking “what should I do to solve this problem” and getting the answer “whatever you can”. VirtualMark As you haven’t made any relevant points, your tacit concession on the matter is accepted. close Well the educational system isn’t what it used to. Come on, I don’t expect you to know anything about CPUs but not even language? Tacit? Concession? This is what you gather from me telling you that you know sh|t? Sarcasm won’t help you, I feed on the tears of people like you :)). That’s because every time you try to feel good about yourself with a witty remark I just pop up with some facts (hope you don’t need a thesaurus for this one) to put you down. I also bore pretty easily so try to keep up. Your “one-line” idea is plain wrong no matter how you put it. “The most expensive CPU you can afford” is not necessarily the fastest or best so you just cost you parents an extra $60 (or 80 pounds which is worse) and got them a weaker CPU. Way to go son. Also it implies that your parents understand that there will be higher costs in the rest of the platform (like a dedicated graphics card, more powerful PSU, more expensive motherboard, more expensive RAM, more expensive cooling system) and also operational costs (like more power consumption). You just cost your parents another $1000 just so they can get that slower CPU that is already more than they need, plus a few bucks extra each month on electricity and a noisier PC. They just wanted a browsing machine son and they gave you the best they had all your life. Why couldn’t you give them proper advice so they don’t end up spending that money with no tangible benefit? They could have gone on a nice trip with the money you let them spend for nothing because you didn’t care enough to send them to someone who knows this stuff, you ungrateful… So no matter how you put it, it’s either dumb or ignorant and any person spending their own money would confirm this ;). Just ask you parents and maybe they’ll give you a smarter answer than the one you were prepared to give them. VirtualMark Wow, now I see that you’re just plain stupid. I would have thought that it was obvious that a higher powered CPU would require more power and better cooling, and that the cost would be higher, and didn’t really feel the need to spoon feed the obvious to you. Honestly I don’t know why the hell you’re even mentioning it, it’s laughable. And you’re still banging on about cost, which just goes back to my original point – if you can afford an i7 buy it. So thanks for proving my point. Anyhow, I’m bored of you now. Go away please and play with your i5, you little cheapskate. Huhster “you little cheapskate.” You are so obviously a teenage pro-troll using a “rig” your daddy bought you. close Ok Mr. DJ then how’s this: If somebody comes asking a washed up “DJ” for CPU advice (yeah, I know what you are, a 20 something guy who tries to imitate the big names in music, who sometimes calls himself a producer without actually producing anything original and plays around on his ripped off Ableton – best you can afford, right? ;)), if someone doesn’t know what CPU they need, they probably also know nothing about this and don’t realize that a better CPU needs more power, better cooling. They might also not realize that choosing a better CPU comes with a different socket so a much more expensive platform overall (MoBo, RAM, discrete GPU as the MoBo doesn’t have video output, even bigger PSU because of this). But you also don’t know this ;). So how are you expected to give someone else this info? You didn’t pay for your DAW so I guess now I know how you tricked your parents into paying for it: the most expensive they could afford. So, you keep it up. It’s no shame knowing shit in some areas. Well, it is when you try to sound smart and fail. But you keep it up ;). If you got over sucking in your field you can get over anything. But enough about this. The point was made. You can pay extra for nothing, or you can read the article and pay for what you need. To each his own. VirtualMark Lol what a nonsensical rant. You shouldn’t have edited your post, as your first one was better. Namely: “sometimes the more expensive CPU is not the fastest” Sometimes being the key word there, well done, you’re learning. Usually it is faster, but occasionally it isn’t. So the i7 is still the better processor. Anyhow, the rest of your post is entirely irrelevant, and as such, your tacit concession on the matter remains noted. close Oh joy. You’re a glutton for punishment. No, the keywords here are “ignorant/dumb/uninformed” ;). If you pay for the most expensive thing you can afford and only ever use a fraction of that because you have no idea what you need or what you buy then you are ignorant at best. And to prove it I showed you that there are cases when not only do you not get to get more than you need, you actually get even less than you would have with the cheaper part. So you pay more for less. Does that sound like something a smart person would recommend? Not really, eh? It’s about as smart as buying 10 loaves of bread every day just for yourself (and implicitly throwing away 9) just because you can afford it. You’re still determined that more expensive is better but I think it’s pretty clear that you lack both common sense and knowledge. As for the “tacit concession”, you’re getting repetitive with stuff you don’t seem to understand. It’s probably what you have to do when you’re reminded that you tricked your parents into buying the most expensive computer they could afford for you just so you can play with knobs and sliders and call yourself a “producer”. Tacit enough? :)) VirtualMark Lol your angry rants are getting longer and longer, you appear to be repeating yourself, and as you havent brought up any further points, your tacit concession on the matter remains noted. And I now consider the discussion closed, and probably won’t be replying any further. But please, keep ranting, I’m sure someone will read it. close You read it, pissed you off, came back for more. You looked like an eager beaver until you realized I nailed your description. So to quote the only thing you managed to say in the last few days in trembling “voice” while having the horrible revelation that you suck even at trolling: your tacit admission that you’re a DJ wannabe who knows shit about CPUs is noted. Sleep on that ;). Huhster OHHHHHH! OH NO SHE DIDN’T. claudette.musser = Randall Snoddy back in 2007 i went for gold and got a q6600 still using it so if i had to do it again i would go for gold again and use it for many years again Kawaii Kurumi Yep agreed, why the heck would parents who just browse the web and watch a bunch of movies require an i7 to do the work??? An i3 is more that enough to handle all of that in todays world, just grab the 6th gen i3 and plug it and go play 4K movies its more than enough MetusBatmanV3 I guess since you make $8 an hour you don’t understand what it means to make six figures a year. Spending a few thousand on a computer is nothing. Mooki What a stupid remark to make after a article that actually shows you that that is certaintly not the case and that a i7 only Potentially could be faster in a end users specific situation. Unless you just throw money at anything that has a higher number and then simply trust it was the best performance you were buying based on that. These sort of articles are nothing new so for my game PC i bought a 2500K and OC’s it to 4.6Ghz. The money i saved by not buying a i7 has been been spend on better components elsewhere. VirtualMark You say it’s a stupid remark, then go on to say about money you saved. Don’t you see the irony in your statement? Lol… clearly money was your concern, so my comment still stands. close VirtualMark, it’s already pretty clear that you confuse price with performance and you can’t establish a usage baseline in order to correctly size your computer for your needs. You throw money at something you don’t need or use. You’re still free to do it just don’t expect it to be considered normal or best solution by any smart person. Ignorance is bliss but comes at a price. So your parents will end up buying a bulky, hot, power hungry $2500 computer thinking that they *need* it when a $500 NUC would have been enough. Coming back to performance and price: i7 4910MQ 3.9GHz, 8MB cache – $570. i7 4950HQ 3.6GHz, 6MB cache + better GPU and TSX-NI – $630. So… You may never use/benefit from TSX-NI instructions, you may never use an integrated GPU, but you can afford the extra $50-60 so you pay more to get a CPU that’s slower. Smart advice… VirtualMark Nice essay, and a cute attempt to appear intelligent. But it doesn’t change my opinion, I’ll still buy top end CPUs. And I’ll always recommend to my friends and family to buy the best system they can afford. Obviously if their budget was small, then the i5 would be the better option, but if they could afford more, then go for the i7. It’s simple enough really, which part don’t you get? As for making use of the full CPU features, generally newer software will make use of those, so it’s good to future proof. For example, I use a lot of VSTs, and some of them have recently been patched to make use of newer instruction sets, and run a lot faster for it. close Oh but I’m not trying to change your opinion (you know the saying, they’re like as*holes, everybody’s got one). I just enjoy bringing some people down to earth the second they try throwing crappy sarcasm along with their crappy opinions in an attempt to give them some weight. Since your opinion revolves around price tags we can all assume your advice was totally crap, being free and all. I just showed you that the more expensive CPU is slower. And your only argument is that “generally… at some point… maybe… my VST software will be improved by a better integrated GPU and TSX-NI instructions”. Also, TSX-NI is permanently disabled through BIOS in most motherboards (you wouldn’t know that, you only know price tags). So that’s what you get for asking a guy who knows little to nothing about a field. It’s ok if you like throwing money at something you’re not using or if your friends have to come to you (of all people) to get such advice. But that will never make it “best option”. It just means that you cannot add any value to such a discussion or properly answer this question, that’s all. You’re the guy who knows next to nothing about whatever domain but tries to look informed: “What car should I buy? The most expensive you can afford.” or “What should I eat? The most expensive thing you can afford.” Etc. VirtualMark “Oh but I’m not trying to change your opinion” Clearly you’re trying your damned hardest, and failing badly. “I just showed you that the more expensive CPU is slower.” No you haven’t. close That’s because your parents didn’t spend enough time to educate you in reading and now you just want to get back at them by telling them to buy more expensive, slower stuff. It;s pretty simple. And I have shown you, you just weren’t able to understand even when I gave you specific product names and official prices. It’s common among the more ignorant population. Paul Nelson I agree they should always buy the best system that they can afford. But, the best system is not necessarily one with an i7. Benchmarks have proven that, in some scenarios, the i5 is as capable or more capable than the i7 and therefore the i5 would be the better system. Especially if the maker decided to use the money saved on using an i5 on installing better graphics, faster storage or a more efficient power supply. VirtualMark Lol, you just proved my point again. Hint: “Especially if the maker decided to use the money saved” Paul Nelson Not at all. Your original statement was “i7 if you can afford it. /article.” My point is that the i7 is not always the faster processor and therefore not worthy of the extra money. Just because you can afford it, does not make it the correct choice. Spending extra on an i7 hoping that it will last longer is a false economy. Chip technology changes. Take the change from Power PC to Intel in Apple Computers. You could have bought the best G4 machine available in 2004, because you could afford it, yet in 2005 the change to Intel wiped out that generation of processors and they soon became obsolete. But it’s fine, I could afford it. Didn’t make it the right choice though did it? VirtualMark Sorry but your incoherent rant proves nothing. You said that the i5 could be faster if you spent extra money on a graphics card, clearly you have no concept of how a PC works. A CPU is not a graphics card, nor is it faster storage. They are completely different parts, you utter fool. Paul Nelson Oh no, you called me a fool whilst completely misunderstanding what I wrote. That actually made me laugh out loud. VirtualMark That’s an interesting story. Tell me another one – what did you hope to achieve here? Did you expect to be able to convince me and change my opinion? Can’t you see that it was a year ago and that I’ve moved on? Can’t you see that I don’t care about a thing that you have to say? Go away please, no need to embarrass yourself any further. MetusBatmanV3 i7 has hyper-threading, if you can afford it, yes, it is the best processor. MetusBatmanV3 Really, so what exactly will be wiping out the i7 next year? MetusBatmanV3 i5 doesn’t have hyper-threading except for one i5 CPU. Which means if you want to take advantage of that technology i7 would be the way to go and if you can afford it what is the issue? Speed isn’t the only thing to consider. Huhster Back under your bridge, please stop feeding him. spoffle An article, an end, an i7. There’s more, but they’re the most obvious. tetriminos http://s24.postimg.org/4n5o666p1/Screenshot_from_2015_07_31_14_32_04.png some dude I kinda hope there’s benchmark where they test multiple application at the same time, and see if HT have any effect or not. most of people run multiple application, heck I play game and watch youtube at the same time. Lagittaja This is kind of relevant, Linustechtips video “CPU Cores for Gaming, Streaming, & Rendering Simultaneously – Is More Actually Better?” He used 5960X to simulate other CPUs. Scenario was gaming Far Cry 4 with rendering video, Twitch streaming, stream capture, AV scan in the background. It’s not a perfect test but pretty damn good showcasing the difference. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GgDZKGA89I I personally have a i7-3770K@4.7Ghz and I chose it over the i5 as I am a heavy multitasker. Plex media server so gf might be watching TV show while I’m gaming and server is doing transcoding. And I backup all my movies/TV shows and shove them through Handbrake with my own best quality/low filesize profile. Gaming/streaming. Multiple VM’s running in Workstation 11 in the backgroun. And so on. I so much want a 8c16t CPU :( GranFaloSentado Obviously i7 was the smartest choice for you. But for the 99% of the population, an i3 or even an AMD APU is more than enough, since they won’t use virtualization or they won’t be streaming video while having a heavily queried DDBB or a webserver. Lagittaja Well that’s the thing. You choose the CPU based on your needs! And for 99% of the population, a modern dual core Celeron/Pentium is more than enough. Even an i3 is overkill.. Heck, if I didn’t do any transcoding/streaming or running multiple VM’s at the same time > a lowly dual core would be enough for me. And I’ve been there and done that.. Purchased a Celeron G530 after I sold my OC’d 2500K as a placeholder before I purchased the 3770K, this was before IVB had even launched. Had it for quite a few months (edit: actually 7½) and it’s crazy how much you get for so little money nowadays. Joel Hruska I don’t think 99% is true. I’ve used the dual-core chips you’re talking about, and while they’re faster than Atom, they’re not that fast. If I had to choose between a dual core Pentium/Celeron and an AMD chip, I’d take the AMD core. Much better graphics performance and better overall multi-threaded perf. http://www.anandtech.com/bench/product/1256?vs=1497 (As an example). Lagittaja So you’re comparing a ~63€ Pentium to a top of the line APU costing 136€, or ~85$ vs 150$. Good job. Since you did that I might as well just go and do this since it’s pretty much the same price difference. http://anandtech.com/show/9320/intel-broadwell-review-i7-5775c-i5-5675c/7 hue hue hue And if you’d compare in similar price brackets your “better overall multi-threaded perf.” doesn’t hold true even the slightest. A6-7400K is almost the same price as the G3420 and the Pentium pretty much rapes that A6. http://www.anandtech.com/bench/product/1256?vs=1492 Or A10-7870K vs i3-4330 http://www.anandtech.com/bench/product/1192?vs=1497 Joel Hruska You’re right, I should’ve made my point more clear. I would not buy a low-end dual-core chip of any flavor. Between the Core i3 and the A10, it entirely depends on how much GPU perf you want. If you want the fastest integrated GPU you can buy at that price point, I’d buy the A10-7850K. If you care more about power consumption and want a strong CPU core, I’d buy the Core i3. Vice Squeezer I got a I5 and play on steam and play pandora at the same time.. never a conflict between the two.. youtube I’ve done that too.. but on pandora the music never stops.. Arian Hajiakbar How is I7-4500? Recommended? Joel Hruska It’s not clear to me why the i7-4500U is considered an i7 at all. It’s a dual-core chip with HT, and its clock speed (1.8GHz base, 3GHz top) is not unusual. It can’t address more than 16GB of RAM and its onboard GPU is an Intel Graphics 4400, not the HD Graphics 4600 that most i7’s carry. (The difference between the two isn’t huge, but I’d expect 4600 on an i7.) I think I’d look for something else. happycube lie7’s annoy the heck out of me. Matt Menezes Haha, lie7…that got me… :-) Naum Rusomarov From my experience, the i7 is better on the desktop if you’re planning on running more than two processing tasks concurrently. If the opposite is true then the i5 is perfectly capable for day to day work. You could even go with the i3 and you will still be fine. Mooki a i7 will only be better in such a case if at least one of those programs benefits from HT. As you can see it could even lower performance. Naum Rusomarov As far as I know the i7 processors have four physical cores, with HT enabled you get 8 cores in total. The i5’s have two physical cores plus 2 virtual cores due to HT, so in total you have four cores detected by the OS. p.s. This is on the desktop. The mobile i5 and i7 are a different story. UPDATE: I was wrong. The i5 have 4 physical cores, but no HT enabled. Thanks to the comments below. :) Sunset Rider No, desktop i5’s have 4 physical cores = 4 logical cores, desktop i7’s have 4 physical cores + HT = 8 logical cores. Eduardo Larios i5 have 4 cores, not 2+ hyper threading. Matt Menezes I see what you’re saying, but that could be misunderstood. An i5 could easily handle Outlook, Word, Chrome w/ 10 tabs, Visual Studio, multiple Explorer windows, SQL Server Management Studio, and YouTube playing music in the background. I say this because my work machine is an i3 (3.4GHz, 2C/4T) and it handles all those tasks just fine. As long as you have a decent IO subsystem (enough memory and an SSD) so the CPU isn’t constantly waiting, you can multitask all day long with a CPU that can address 4 threads like an i5. Now, if you are talking about applications that soak up every bit that a core provides and spawn threads left and right, then you might want to step up to an i7. That being said, even if you are only running 3-4 single-threaded apps that each peg an entire core, the only thing an i7 will give over an i5 is the tiny clock speed advantage (since HT won’t help). thepaintsaint In short, to figure it out for yourself and learn more, go to ark.intel.com. bob lebart If the user/builder wanted to save some $, and was mostly gaming, or just doing one main task, an overclocked i5 is great value. As the article said, for a multi-purpose machine, more threads are always better. My pc serves as a trading station (6 monitors, 2 different heavy market-steaming trading programs running, incl CNBC, 2 chats, multiple browsers up!!) and at other times it’s a gaming machine- a non-overclocked i7 Haswell, 16 gb ram, nVidia SLI system, and handles it all with plenty of headroom. Oh, and how could I forget: Photoshop…sometimes with all the above stuff running! Vice Squeezer I have thinking of upgrading to a I7 but my I5 is still fricking fast.. but to have 32 gigs of ram is very tempting.. games in the future will be more and more demanding for power and speed.. Mooki I would not do that if i where you it is simply not worth it unless you have some specific aplications that would benefit of that and are important enough for you. If not you will be way better off upgrading your videocard or SSD or anything else you think you might need. Vice Squeezer I just did that getting a 980.. but feel I still need to up my ram from 8 to 16 also wanting an upgrade on my mother board that supports blueray and wi fi, my ausus is four years old. I tried one of those blueray usb plugs still doesn’t see my speakers which are plugged directly to my sound card. Wanting a prettier tower.. a see thru one.. because both video and sound cards lite up.. jimv1983 What does having an i5 have to do with having 32GB RAM? With a 64-bit CPU the theoretical limit is like 2 million TB of RAM. I thought the only thing that limits that is the motherboard. Joel Hruska No. Intel and AMD chips have limits on maximum addressable RAM due to memory controller limitations and market segmentation. Right now, top end Xeons can address up to 1,536GB of RAM per chip, but that requires ECC RAM. jimv1983 Interesting. I didn’t know that. Are there any motherboards out there that have enough RAM slots to have 1,536GB of RAM? The biggest RAM sticks I have seen are 16GB and the most slots I’ve seen on a motherboard is 24 for a max of 384GB. Joel Hruska 32GB sticks are on the market. A high-end Xeon, according to Intel, can support 6TB of RAM in a dual-socket solution and 12TB in a quad-socket. However, this doesn’t square with the listed spec sheet on Intel’s own website. SuperMicro makes a motherboard that it claims can support up to 6TB of RAM using riser cards and Jordan Creek technology. Given that the largest server DIMMs I see are 32GB, that only works out to 3TB of RAM. Presumably the other 3TB will be available once 64GB DIMMs are out. Tim Tian ECC, not Buffered? Joel Hruska The spec sheet just said ECC. I’m not sure how much registered memory is still in use. Didn’t Intel phase out its fully-buffered DIMMs? Tim Tian FB-DIMMs, yeah, but I think you still need the RDIMMs for the full load out with RAM. Can’t find any half decent info though. Tim Tian Looks like disqus ate my reply again. Pretty sure FB DIMMs are being replaced by LR DIMMs, but R DIMMs (or LR DIMMs) are still required for more than 3 or 4 per channel. jimv1983 It would all depend on what the uses are. If I was building a computer to do simple browsing, media viewing, very light simple games, etc then I’d get the i5. If I was building a computer to play high end games, professional video editing or 3D graphics rendering I’d get an i7. This question is like asking would you buy a compact sedan or a huge truck. It all depends on your uses. Idiot Inside, Moron Outside Sum it up. i5 for gaming and i7 for more CPU intensive tasks using programs that can utililse the cores and threads. DecksUpMySleeve If it’s a workstation of any sort, 4-6MB cache all the way for me. Other than that I seek the wattage to performance G-spot for the i7 series. For example the i7-860 had the best performance per watt at it’s time. As will the i7-6920HQ right around the corner. For a gamer a high i5 will feel similar to any i7, but if you do rendering, digital art or video processing a low i7 will shine. spoffle Performance per watt isn’t a very good metric, with how far a lot of i5 and i7 chips will overclock, performance per dollar with a typical overclock added into the equation is the more sensible metric. Joel Hruska Most workstation users *don’t* overclock. Unless you’re buying from a vendor that guarantees it, like BOXX. spoffle Maybe they don’t, but I’m one of the ones that do, else I’m missing out on a level of performance that I otherwise wouldn’t see for a number of years. My current workstation has a 4930K that comfortably overclocks to 4.6ghz. Nothing would come close to that for raw performance at stock except those mental 18 core $4500 Xeon you can get on 2011-3. DecksUpMySleeve Sensible for the willfully wasteful. spoffle In what sort of context? DecksUpMySleeve Overclocking in general drops the processing per watt while upping the frequency, the processing may go up 5% for a 9% power hike. They optimize the default base clocks for a reason, and that 5% gain usually only translates to a very marginal difference unless the system is already near cap. I myself ran my i7-860(years back) at 2.7 instead of the 2.86 base clock and left the turbo to deal with demand hikes, ran cooler and therein never throttled due to temp under load. Everything I threw at it ran like butter. I find a 1/2-2/3rds full SSD to make a larger difference than clock speed ever could. When friends came over and played on my rig they went home sad to log on elsewhere. But back to my initial point the means doesn’t justify the ends in most cases for OCing, modern CPUs aren’t that much of a bottleneck in most applications. One less background process comes to the same effect, it’s better to keep those well managed than to ever OC. I myself know nearly every process and either use Msconfig to take them off startup or manually kill them through task manager. Works like a charm, in effect a ghz saved is a ghz earned. From what I read of your post though you hiked a hex core 3.9 to a 4.6ghz so a 17% clock increase translating to probly a 11% processing gain. I’m guessing your workload is hefty enough to possibly require such beastliness(12mb cache) but most overclockers are simply overkilling it, hampering overall performance and stability. On a side note; Broadwell-E with Turbo boost 2 technology may be something of interest to you in Q1 2016, though replacing your current system might not be all that rational, but none the less interesting. Skylake-E’s X models may be your next reasonable purchase. spoffle You’re looking at it very narrowly though, and your scope of overclocking is, well pretty weak. I’m talking a decent overclock, not a weak one that’s barely over single digits. Any PC I’ve had for the last 10 years, I’ve managed a hefty overclock. I’m talking in the 30-50% range. A few percent is a waste of time and effort. Also, I’m not sure why you’re comparing an SSD to an overclock. They aren’t comparable. When you’re doing light tasks, an overclocked CPU will still step down its clock speed to match the demand, so you’re not going to notice an overclock much doing light menial tasks where you’re going to notice the big SSD improvements. I’m talking heavy demand situations, as I use my system as a workstation, by applying a hefty overclock, I get a level of performance I’d otherwise be waiting years for. Unless I went down the multi Xeon route, and not at all if we’re talking single threaded performance. On top of that, the power consumption increase is vastly overstated, and the reason why CPUs are clocked conservatively is because they want to sell people who don’t overclock, new chips that are faster. There have been IPC (instructions per clock) improvements over the last few years, but they’ve been fairly conservative. Each new Intel CPU range that comes out is clocked about 5% faster on average, and they’ve been consistently upping the clock speed at that sort of rate whilst making the above IPC improvents too, so in reality they’re being held back for a few reasons, to give lay people an upgrade path (profit, and why they keep changing sockets) and cooling, the semi professional hardware like x79 and x99 already run hotter anyway, and have got loads of headroom. That’s why they sell unlocked K variety chips. DecksUpMySleeve I’m not understating the gains of OC, just practical advisories for the everyday workstation. Also I’m not sure you read the most recent edit of my post. I agreed that in specific cases the gains were more practical. I’m also very aware of the IPC clock gains, but with Skylake really being the end of the road for a couple years it’ll be a decent investment on arrival not soon outmoded. VirtualMark I find it’s better to undervolt modern chips, as it allows them to run cooler and thus run at their turbo frequency more often. I’ve tested my 4700HQ and it can run constantly at turbo now, even though it’s a mobile chip. Tim Tian Hmm. Interesting. Did you use the limited unlock overclock as well? And how much were you able to undervolt (I’d like a ballpark for my 4770MQ so I don’t need to reboot that often)? VirtualMark I used the Intel Extreme Tuning Utility, and was able to set the multipliers for 1-4 active cores. The undervolt I’m currently running is -94mV, although this will vary from chip to chip. I undervolted my Core 2 Duo laptop too a few years back, and found that it ran about 10°C cooler. Tim Tian Now I’m curious whether you have Win Vista/7/8 on your laptop, or a old version that runs on XP. anyway, sue to unrelated issues, my big laptop is dead with a “BAD_SYSTEM_CONFIG_INFO” every time. Think I messed something up with MSConfig.exe. Nothings helped so far :/ Dustymack Thats like asking if you would like a Ford Edge or a Mustang. Sunset Rider Two years ago when I built my last PC, I debated between the i5-4670k and the i7-4770k. I ended up going with the 4770k because I reasoned, “This PC is going to last me the next 4-6 years before I need to upgrade again. How much is $100 worth to me througout 4-6 years? How much is a faster CPU worth to me throughout 4-6 years?” Seeing as how I was already spending near $1500 on a new PC, i figured spending another $100 on the processor wasn’t such a bad idea for the next 4-6 years. It’s been two years and my usage pattern has varied wildy, from simple web-browsing, to playing the latest vidya games, to encoding raw 32 GB videos. I haven’t once said to myself, “Darn, I wish I had bought an i5 and saved $100.” lopo Future proof is still i5 for gaming. If you do lots of video editing, then i7 is for you. Actually even i3 can play every game you want to play without any problems. You just need good graphics card but you wont need i7 if you dont do video editing and stuff that needs more power from cpu and less power from gpu. Mike kizaberg I have a I7 4700hq for graphics design and gaming to be honest, i also do a lot of benchmarking, while watching very high res videos online to. It does the job that i want it to do, while for those who are looking to do the very basic on computers should not even get a i3 or i5, they should just go with a celeron in that case. Robert Foy I had a i5 that someone gave me for a gift, 3 months later ran into some money and bought a i7 3770k, and boy what a difference it made with games, especially Planetside 2 and others. If you can afford it, get an i7, i5 min. i3 or any dual core would be a waste. This is coming from a gamer’s POV btw, if your not a gamer, then go with whats the most efficient performance/cost wise. But if a gamer, go with i7, you won’t be disappointed. AlbiteTwins That’s odd. Most benchmarks show that a desktop i5 or i7 from the same generation don’t make too much difference for most games, Planetside 2 included. http://www.hardwarepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/planetside-2-benchmark.jpg Was the i5 you replaced one of the those low power consumption models (i5-3xxxS or i5-3xxxT) ? BenjaminShade Xeon E3-1231 V3 you can pick up one of these for $210 from microcenter or $250 reatail, and I believe it is the same basic chip as the i7 4770. It isn’t overclock-able but with hyper-threading a 3.8gHz turbo and 32gb addressable memory i doubt you will care. Plus it is built to higher specs being enterprise class so the silicon will physically last longer. It also allows for ECC memory in case you are one of those crazies that want’s to run your computer 24/7 for something like i dunno mining of crypto currency’s. Last but not least you can drop it in any standard lga 1150 mobo. Conservative411 90% of people only NEED i5. vision33r Sandy Bridge i7 is a good bargain right now, pair with a nice solid ASUS mobo it can last forever and still competitive today. Philip Du Toit I came for the comments. *Grabs popcorn* J.L. Cannot but wonder why no compiler guru has yet come up with a technique to virtualize threading so a single thread application can benefit from AMD multi-threading capabilities. Kind of inverse Hyper-Threading. Let’s hope HSA will bring something similar to the market, similar to hot-air for now that is, indeed. okay well not ever …. http://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2006/07/7263-2/ tetriminos the reality is, things haven’t changed much since sandy bridge see this graph of the difference between i5 2500K and i7 4790 http://s24.postimg.org/4n5o666p1/Screenshot_from_2015_07_31_14_32_04.png KB Kingsberry I’m not a Gamer, however, I will be working with 4k video editing. Would the core i5 do just as well as an i7? I learned that I need at least a core i5 processor just to be able to work. TKosh So it is dual core now again???? What happened to duo core? dual core used to be the chips before the duo cores. Dora Hi, I need a laptop for software engineering and GAME engineering. I can’t decide between 2 asus computers (f555UA-EH71#x555la) one has i7 and intel hd 5500, other has i5 but nvidia gtx. Which one should I choose?

This PC was first shown off by Biostar back at Computex in June. The Biostar Racing P1 mini PC is based upon the 14nm Intel Atom Z8350 quad-core processor with 2W TDP. Complementing the processor is 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage and a good selection of I/O options, including six USB ports. The Biostar Racing P1 mini PC measures 129 x 83 x 27mm (0.29L) and it is a fanless design for completely silent operation. Biostar has created this mini PC as part of its Racing range and thus implemented carbon fibre styling and "sports car curves". If that's not flashy enough and you aren't going to squirrel it away behind your screen, using the VESA compatible mounts, Biostar has included RGB LEDs plus a 5V 5050 LED Header for you to add LED strips to this PC and to control via its Vivid LED DJ software. Inside, the Intel Z8350 quad-core processor has a base/boost frequency of 1.44/1.92GHz. This 14nm chip has a max accompanying memory size of 2GB according to Intel but Biostar has it working with 4GB of DDR3L-1600 RAM. The built-in GPU is the Intel HD Graphics 400 with base/boost of 200/500MHz and 12 execution units. Built-in storage (64GB) is of the eMMC Flash type. I've tabulated the full tech specs below:   Model Biostar Racing P1  Dimension 129*83*27mm (0.29L), weighs 255g   CPU Z8350 Quad core 1.92G/ Fanless   CPU TDP 2W   Memory 4GB   Storage 64GB   Expansion Micro SDXC card reader   Video HDMI   Networking Realtek RTL8111H GbE LAN AMPAK AP6255 802.11ac + BT4.0(onboard)   Audio Realtek ALC5645 with Combo Jack   USB 1USB3.0 5USB2.0   Power 20W ( 5V, 4A PSU)   VESA Yes   While a step above the average PC-HDMI stick in size, the Racing P1 is compatible with standard VESA mounts to fix to the back of your monitor or TV so you can tidy it away. All the extra connectivity options provide are a big jump up from what is available on a PC HDMI stick. Unfortunately in its email to HEXUS Biostar neglected to mention pricing and availability. However, according to reports around Computex time it should sell for under $200. If you are interested please keep an eye on the usual Biostar distributors.

Thermal grease is the gooey stuff that’s applied to the CPU and GPU (if one is present) to ensure the best possible bond with the heatsink. A heatsink is a metal device that uses copper to rapidly radiate heat away from chip(s). It’s connected to one or two fans that blow across it. Therefore, proper bonding of the heatsink to the chip(s) via thermal grease provides the best possible cooling of the chip(s). Many accuse Apple’s heavy handed approach of actually working to insulate rather than efficiently cool the chip(s). This means the fans have to work harder to keep the chip(s) cool, and therefore the battery life gets used up more quickly. Even worse, some say the excess heat can lead to premature death of the chip(s), and therefore the MacBook Pro itself. The evidence Take a look at the state of my 15in mid-2015 MacBook Pro after I’d removed the heatsink to undertake the steps outlined below: In other words, this is the grease applied at Apple’s manufacturing plant. Yuk! The chip at the left is the CPU, while the chip at the right is the GPU (note: not all MacBook Pros feature a GPU). Above the MacBook Pro case you can see the heatsink itself, which in the case of most MacBook Pros is a wide metal bar. Ideally the grease would be just on the chip die surfaces, rather than spread across the entire top of the chip surface. I’ve rebonded/regreased the heatsink of every MacBook Pro I’ve owned (and a white Intel MacBook before that). All had extremely long lives. If you can’t wait to see the results of my latest effort, scroll to the bottom of this web page. I advise you rebond/regrease YOUR MacBook Pro too, although only after reading the following really, really important conditions: 1. Only do it if the MacBook Pro is out of its warranty period; 2. Only do it if you know what you’re doing – it’s a moderately easy task if you’ve ever been inside a PC to replace a component, for example, but likely impossibly tricky if you’re new to all this; you may have to remove the logic board depending on the model of your MacBook Pro; 3. You do all of this at your own risk. You take responsibility for it. You make the choice to do it. I tried hard not to make any mistakes below but I cannot be held liable for any omissions or bloopers. What you’ll need The following items are required: Thermal grease, a.k.a. heatsink compound. That’s the syringe in the photo above. You only need a tiny, tiny amount – literally maybe a gram or two – and will be forced to buy way more than you’re ever going need. People online argue about which brand is best. Just google if you really want to. Isopropyl alcohol, to clean off the old thermal grease. Again you won’t need a huge amount. I got a 250ml bottle and used almost none of it. Paper towels and Q-tips for cleaning off the old grease (also known as kitchen roll and cotton buds for UK readers). Anti-static protection ideally including an antistatic mat, earthing plug and wristband. I really cannot emphasize this enough. Some professionals laugh at precautions like this but the risk of zapping a component with static is serious. It’s a mistake to assume that a zap will outright destroy a component, or that the zap will be seen. The electrical discharge might be invisible and might just damage something so that it becomes faulty 1 in 1000 times it’s used. Why take the risk? Screwdrivers, including the right size and shape for your MacBook Pro, including its bottom case and the screws used to fix the heatsink in place. I used a bag of screwdrivers bought to repair iPhones. They cost almost nothing on eBay. Metal polish to polish the heatsinks, of which more later. I used an old bottle of silver polish I had hanging around. You need one of those marginally abrasive old-fashioned polishes, rather than one of the newer magical liquid cleaners. The steps you need to follow Broadly speaking you need to do the following: 1. Remove the bottom case of your MacBook Pro. 2. Possibly remove the logic board. 3. Detach the heatsink. 4. Clean everything. 5. Polish the heatsink copper pads. 6. Reapply thermal grease. 7. Put everything back together again. All of this typically involves unscrewing a handful of screws, disconnecting some logic board connectors, and perhaps rerouting a cable or two. However, I’m NOT going to go into how to do this because: (a) The steps vary quite a lot depending on the model, and; (b) The steps are detailed far better than I could ever write them over at iFixIt. Often there will be a specific guide to removing the heatsink for your model, or you might just have the follow the general teardown steps and stop when you’ve removed your heatsink. Just search for your model at iFixIt, which will be identified by its year of manufacture and size of screen – both of which you can discover by clicking the Apple menu, then About This Mac. Before even lifting a screwdriver read and reread the steps for your model so you’re absolutely sure what you’re doing, and what to expect. Print them off if it helps. Don’t forget the most important early step, which is to disconnect the battery from the logic board as soon as you open the case. Cleaning and polishing Once you’ve got the heatsink off, use the dry paper towel to remove as much of the old thermal grease as possible from both the chip(s) and the heatsink surface. Don’t scape! Using even a plastic tool to scrape can cause scratches in the soft copper used for the heatsink surface. That means the heatsink won’t be as efficient because less surface area will be able to touch the chip. Next, use the alcohol to remove the remaining heatsink compound by applying it to a piece of paper towel or a Q-tip. Use the alcohol sparingly, and definitely DO NOT saturate either, but try to get the chip(s) and the chip die(s) as clean as possible. Use small amounts of metal polish to shine the heatsink copper pads that make contact with the chip(s). Polish repeatedly but carefully until you can start to see your reflection in them. Take a look at the photo below. It’s not the best shot but the left-hand heatsink shows the reflection of my fingers taking the photograph, while the right-hand heatsink is still dull and fuzzy because it hasn’t yet been polished. While polishing be careful not to apply too much force so that you bend or distort the heatsink component. I didn’t believe polishing the heatsink was worthwhile until I tried it and saw a massive improvement in cooling. In fact, I rebonded the heatsink on two separate occasions, polishing only on the second attempt. Temperatures dropped substantially between each attempt. Once you’ve got the heatsink copper pads polished nicely, use the alcohol to thoroughly clean them. Ensure there’s no fluff or dust on either the chip(s) or heatsink coppers. At this point it’s not a bad idea to clean dust and fluff out of the fans, and the air intake areas. Canned compressed air is good for this. Apply a tiny, tiny pea-size amount of heatsink compound in the centre of each of the CPU, and then the GPU if you have one. Don’t spread it yourself! It will be squashed out and spread evenly when the heatsink is reapplied, which you should do next, and then follow your initial steps in reverse to reassemble your MacBook Pro. Don’t forget to reattach the battery before screwing the case back on! Test your MacBook Pro once it’s booted by running lots of apps and really stressing the machine until the fans are spinning. If you get any kind of crash or freeze then you might not have applied the heatsink properly, and should repeat the steps above. What results to expect Below are before and after figures for temperatures, as provided by the excellent Hardware Monitor app. To get these figures I closed all apps and then let my MacBook Pro idle for around five minutes, only moving the mouse cursor occasionally to stop the MacBook Pro entering sleep mode. The difference is quite incredible. Look at the CPU and GRAPH figures, which represent the CPU and GPU respectively. Note that the fans, identified here as LEFT and RIGHT, were spinning at their minimum rotational velocities, so don’t reflect any temperature difference in this instance. Also note that the “before” figures above are from my SECOND attempt at rebonding/regreasing the heatsink, at which point I polished the heatsink coppers. Here’s what the figures looked like prior to my first attempt, when the MacBook Pro was still using the grease applied in the factory: When this measurement was taken the MacBook Pro was doing nothing in particular, with a handful of basic apps open. In other words, comparing the factory-applied thermal grease to my own attempts, I might’ve managed to drop the CPU and GPU idle temperatures by 8 degrees. That’s just incredible. Now do you see why this is worth doing for a long and healthy life for your MacBook Pro? . , Leave a comment... Need advise on purchasing a Mac Book Pro. Thanks. Lee Schroter — P.D.Schroter · Oct 2, 09:27 AM · # Thanks for the nice writeup! (Tho you really should move that “don’t forget to detach the battery” step onto the first list.) In over 30 years of usually intense personal computing, I’ve never had a CPU or GPU fail; problems were other parts failing on the logic board, on the spinning disks and in the power supplies. So it’d be good to understand this work in the context of how it will really help. If it reduces the risk of failure from 0.5% to 0.4%, it’s probably not worth doing except for the pleasure/geekery of it. Spending maybe $100 of time/supplies with a 99.9% chance of not mattering means an expected cost of 1000 X $100. Add also the risk of screwing up. (I say this as somebody who has re-done the heat sinks on a couple of PCs. Successfully, and with good results because the parts WERE running over spec.) I presume that this work merely moves the heat away from the 2 chips faster, and won’t affect the many heat-sensitive parts in the rest of the MBP. So it’d be nice to know what Intel or anybody else says about the CPU’s life span at different temps. Thanks again, and in advance for a reply. — Walt French · Oct 3, 02:06 PM · # Hi Walt I’m afraid I can’t provide the reassurances you need because what I wrote is based on my own experience, and that of others. It’s a bit like applying underseal to a car. Will it work without it? Yes. Will it work for many years. Yes, Will it last for many years? Well, that’s why we apply underseal – and it’s only when you’ve had rust that you see the light. The info you’re looking for is out there on Google. Macs undoubtedly have issues surrounding GPU death, related often to Apple’s poor quality manufacturing (there’s a product recall on several models) but as I mention in the piece lots of people ascribe their troubles to poor cooling. Indeed, Apple repairers like Louis Rossmann are a little obsessed with the poor state of cooling on MacBook Pro computers. — Keir Thomas · Oct 3, 02:30 PM · # Nice text! A curiosity (non related to the article): What wallpaper is that? — Harlley Sathler · Oct 4, 10:50 AM · # This is great advice, very technical but it would be wise to follow if you want to keep a Mac around for as long as possible. I suspect the current (even if ancient) MacBook Pro lineup will be the last true “Pro” Mac lineup that Apple made, so if you have one, take good care of it! Everything is USB-C, dongles, and no fans from here on out… for better or worse. — Annoyed Mac fan · Oct 6, 01:58 PM · # Name Remember Email Website Message Textile help   ◀︎ macOS Sierra's hidden window expansion trick Thoroughly testing your Mac's RAM – an up-to-date how to (2016; macOS Sierra-tested) ▶︎ © 2013-16 Keir Thomas/MacFreda Publishing We work hard to generate ideas and find stories for Mac Kung Fu.

Intel Corporation helped shape Silicon Valley and our tech-driven world, but it isn’t clear whether Intel shares will remain compelling as PCs wane in prominence. Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Oct 3, 2016 at 10:16AM Image Source: Intel. For a company that produces and sells a product consumers never even see, semiconductor titan Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) incredible place within our broader consumer consciousness speaks to both its business acumen and resounding success. Few companies have dominated their industries like Intel Corporation, the semiconductor giant whose chips power an impressive share of our increasingly digital lives. Unsurprisingly, Intel stock has also proven to be an investment for long-term investors, turning $1,000 in 1972 to over $2.6 million, or $3.2 million with dividends reinvested. Today, Intel's chart reveals a company in transition. Company Name Ticker Symbol Market Cap P/E Ratio Dividend Yield Intel Corporation Nasdaq: INTC $180 Billion 18.0x 2.8% Data Source: Google Finance.  However, this sampling of financial data speaks to a small piece of Intel's vaunted corporate history. As such, let's delve deeper into Intel Corporation's past, and examine what the future likely holds for its shares. Intel, Wintel, and mobile Intel's history still stands as one of the most seminal and influential success stories in Silicon Valley. Founded by two former engineers from Fairchild Semiconductor -- Gordon Moore, of Moore's Law fame, and Robert Noyce -- Intel became a success nearly overnight. Moore and Noyce started Intel Corporation in 1968 with help from an investment from legendary venture capitalist Arthur Rock, and conducted Intel's IPO only three short years afterward. The recently deceased Andy Grove, the CEO who ran Intel in its most dominant years, was hired as the company's third employee. Through the '60s and '70s, Intel's business primarily involved producing memory chips, and the company profited tremendously. In 1970, Intel's sales totaled just $4 million, and by 1973, the chipmaker passed $3 million in monthly revenue. However, it wasn't until Intel moved headlong into microprocessors -- the chips that executed the central processing task in computers -- that it ascended to the dominance for which it's commonly known. Intel first aligned itself with early PC-era power IBM, then expanded its presence along with Microsoft's Windows to form the operating system and processor alliance that completely dominated the PC market. In 1983, Intel passed the $1 billion mark in annual revenue. Going forward, Intel's PC microprocessor business controlled the vast majority of its market. However, as is so often the case in business, Intel's understandable fixation on dominating the PC market also hindered its ability to foresee the coming revolution in smartphones, a reality to which Intel continues to adapt today. Image Source: Intel. Intel Corporation in the post-PC era  For years, Intel's PC chips and its x86 architecture succeeded by virtue of a singular focus on performance. With PCs and laptops easily connected to a power source, power efficiency understandably mattered little. It wasn't until the dawn of the smartphone era where power efficiency and performance became equally important considerations for chipmakers. While Intel failed to foresee this change, or simply refused to alter its business tactics in the face of it, other semiconductor architecture designers didn't, notably the British chip design firm ARM Holdings, whose chip architecture has supplanted Intel's as the de facto standard on which all mobile chips are designed. Intel has tried for years to dent ARM Holdings' market share in mobile, to little avail, and it seems unlikely Intel will directly participate in powering mobile devices. Crucially for Intel stock's outlook, though, that doesn't mean the company cannot find success in the post-PC era. In reaction to its lot in mobile, Intel has more recently tailored a new strategy to play to its strength in the data center servers that constitute the backbone of the cloud computing and mobile revolutions. What's more, Intel has also aggressively developed new classes of chips that cater to coming tech trends including the Internet of Things.  At present, the tangible signs of progress remain in flux. In Intel's most recent quarter, Intel's sever chip segment saw revenue increase 5%, which some analysts commented seems softer than expected. Intel's IoT chip business saw sales increase 2% compared to the year prior. However, Intel's PC chip business, which still produces the bulk of its revenues, saw its sales decline 3%. Simply said, Intel remains a business still struggling to balance its legacy monopoly in PC chips with a less certain future. To be sure, Intel will not fully fade away in the decades to come, but its financial profile seems likely to change as we move deeper into the post-PC era.

Today AMD announced its new 7th generation Pro APUs, also known as 'Bristol Ridge Pro' processors. As with previous AMD Pro chips, the new generation brings renewed performance and feature gains alongside enterprise-class reliability and security. AMD hopes to continue the success of the Pro series as since mid-2014 it has enjoyed a 45 per cent uplift in shipments of this range. For the first time AMD will be offering both 65W and 35W APUs as part of the Pro APU range. The 35W parts will be easily recognisable with their 'E' suffix and are meant for the growingly popular ultra-small form factor PC systems. These lower power consumption processors still offer plenty of performance, according to AMD, with clear leadership especially with regards to the integrated GPU. AMD chose to make a direct comparison between its Pro A12-9800E and the competitive Intel Core i5-6500T (with Intel HD Graphics 530) in real-world shipping business systems. In PCMark 8 v2 Home the AMD system scored 3461, while the Intel system scored 2965. That's a 17 per cent improvement on AMD's side. However, I noticed that the comparison AMD system had an SSD while the Intel system used a 5,400rpm HDD. In the perhaps fairer graphics comparison between the same machines AMD's R7 Graphics trounced the Intel HD Graphics 530 in 3DMark 11 Performance tests scoring P3050 against P1622. That's 88 per cent better. Important to the appeal of AMD's 7th generation Pro APUs are the other core improvements that were present in the non-Pro 'Bristol Ridge' AM4 socket A-Series products which include; greater power efficiency, support for DDR4 memory, PCIe Gen 3, USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-C, NVMe, SATA Express, and enhanced graphics. Alongside these improvements AMD delivers the 'Pro' enterprise-class features of AMD Secure processor for hardware-based security, open-standard DASH manageability, AMD-V virtualisation, plus commercial-grade quality assurance and warranties. The first products we know of packing AMD 7th generation Pro APUs are the HP Elitedesk 705 G3 range, as pictured above. AMD told us that more systems were being readied by partners for launch in the coming days/weeks. Below you can find a chart showing the SKUs announced today.

Not for the regular enthusiast, but for the vendors. AMD will be able to push more APUs on the ultrabook market or on the laptop where power&heat constraints did not allow it before. Posted by ET3D - Wed 05 Oct 2016 21:31 Now I officially can't wait for Bristol Ridge DIY. I just tried to upgrade my HTPC from a 2TB HD (almost full) to a 4TB one, and the nForce drivers can't work with 4TB. That nForce based MB was a serious mistake. I really wish AMD would release that platform already.

The company claims that the 2U server with 22 cores is 20% faster than boxes running the older Haswell family of Intel chips. In our testing, we found that Dell is right. The server arrived and we slammed it into our crowded rack at Expedient in Indianapolis. The R730xd was really crammed, yet there was room for more. The 2U frame has room for 16 3.5-inch drives, totaling 128TB of storage. Added PCIe SSD drives can make it a hybrid storage SAN without going to SAN resources. Like HPE servers, Dell can take forever and a weekend to boot. This said, inside is a highly articulate management console that allowed us to re-fit operating system after hypervisor. We tried VMware 6, Windows 2012 R2 (don’t tell Microsoft that the previews of Server 2016 worked, too), and Red Hat Enterprise 6. Then we tried CentOS, but we did have one kernel explosion with FreeBSD that we were unable to repeat. XenServer 6.5 worked without incident.

The performance gains of the new Kaby Lake-based Core i7-7700K are much harder to put down on paper - or, er - your LCD screen - because we don't know the exact clocks. Expect more news on the 7700K as it breaks.   Intel is very close to the release of its Kaby Lake architecture, arriving in the form of the Core i7-7700K, but first we have some leaked benchmarks that tease the improvements of Intel's new 14nm+ architecture.     The upcoming Core i7-7700K performance is shaping up well, with leaked Geekbench 4 results showing that Intel has managed to pull off some great single-threaded performance improvements over Skylake, but the multi-threaded performance isn't left out in the cold. Intel's upcoming Core i7-7700K arrives with a base clock of 4.2GHz, while boost clocks will have it driving up to around 4.5GHz. Intel has slapped a 95W TDP on the Core i7-7700K, and it still uses the LGA 1151 socket.   Performance wise, the new Kaby Lake-based Core i7-7700K had a single-core score of 6131 on Geekbench 4, while the multi-threaded score was 20,243 - this is a 42% increase over the current Skylake-based Core i7-6700K, which scores just 4300 points or so in the single-core test. The multi-core result is just as interesting, with a 20% increase in performance over the 6700K and its 16,756 score.   We should expect Intel and its motherboard partners to launch Z270 chipsets alongside the desktop launch of Kaby Lake, with a GIGABYTE board teased in this Geekbench 4 result.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 2, 2016 at 11:41AM Dividend returns can really stack up over time. Image source: Getty Images.  Many investors are attracted to technology companies primarily due to the prospect of significant, and relatively rapid, share price appreciation. However, there are also many investors that like the idea of investing in tech companies -- particularly ones that are poised to deliver reasonable amounts of revenue and profit growth in the years ahead -- that provide a steady (and growing) income stream in the form of dividends. In this column, I'd like to highlight three tech stocks that pay significant dividends and are well positioned to increase those dividends at a consistent clip over time. The chip specialist Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) currently pays a dividend of $0.26 per quarter, or $1.04 per share on an annual basis. For a while, Intel was a name that was known for offering a relatively high dividend yield – often to the tune of 4% -- but the company's share price appreciation over the last couple of years has brought it down to a smaller, though still quite respectable, 2.79%. Further, Intel is well positioned to grow its dividend payments out in time. Though some income seekers may have felt "burned" when Intel failed to raise its dividend in 2013 and 2014, the company's business performance has stabilized and is actually back on a growth path. As a result, the company delivered solid dividend increases in 2015 and again in 2016. In time, I expect that the company's attempts to stabilize its core personal computer chip business while looking to other markets (data center, non-volatile memory, and Internet of Things) for growth will allow it to deliver steady revenue and profit growth. As long as that strategy works out, Intel should be able to deliver consistent, reliable, and worthwhile dividend increases to its shareholders. The software giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a household name in the world of technology stocks. Its Windows operating system powers the majority of personal computers, its Office suite of productivity software is extremely popular, it is one of the three major game console vendors, and its cloud and server software businesses have also been doing extremely well. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share (and that figure has grown consistently over the last several years), which works out to $1.56 per share on an annualized basis. As of this writing, this represents a dividend yield of around 2.72%. Generally speaking, dividends and other capital return programs are funded by a company's free cash flow, and Microsoft is a cash generating machine. Over the last twelve months, Microsoft generated nearly $25 billion in free cash flow, or approximately $3.21 per share. This means that even if Microsoft doesn't grow the amount of free cash flow that it generates from here (though I do expect Microsoft to continue to grow), it's well positioned to continue to deliver meaningful dividend increases for years to come. The iDevice maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) only relatively recently restarted its capital return program, but the company's efforts here have been quite aggressive. Though Apple seems to favor aggressive buybacks to aggressive dividends, the company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.57 per share ($2.28 per share on an annualized basis), working out to a dividend yield of 2.07%. Although Apple's business is expected to dip in the current fiscal year, analysts generally expect a rebound in both revenue and earnings per share in the company's coming fiscal year. Additionally, Apple's current dividend on an annualized basis represents just a fraction of the free cash flow per share that the company has been able to generate year-in and year-out. There's little doubt in my mind that, barring a "black swan" event that completely wreaks havoc on Apple's business, the iDevice maker will be able to increase its dividend for many years to come.         Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday     Everything We Know About 2017 MacBook Pro Posted: Oct 27 2016, 10:43am CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, in News | Apple     Its been a long time since Apple updated its MacBook lineup and now we have concrete evidence about a major update coming up for Apple's flagship Mac devices. Here is what we know about the 2017 MacBook Pro. The MacBook is considered to be one of the most powerful and productive laptops in the industry and this fall we are expecting a sizzling update in the machine. The Retina MacBook Pro has two versions which include the 13 and 15 inch machines. This fall it is expected that an update will occur which will include a thinner body and many people are looking forward to the lighter touch panel which includes a touch pad ID functionality. Don't Miss: The Black Friday Deals to Buy now on Amazon What is coming up in the next MacBook Retina Pro Design Alterations Authentic sources such as KGI securities and Bloomberg have given out the verdict that Apple will be giving out the new version of the MacBook Pro 13 and 15 inch this fall 2016. It is expected that the machines could be out as early as October which makes sense as Apple is aiming to release the mac software mac0S 10.12.1 also in October. This way we will be able to see the updated version by late October. The MacBook Pros is anticipated to have a much thinner and lighter composition than what we observe currently. However the body of the machine is not expected to be tampered with like we saw in other versions such as MacBook Air and Retina Macbook. You will be able to enjoy shallower curves on the edges. The track pad is also improved to be wide pressure sensitive along with a flatter and smoother keyboard. Other changes in the keyboard include an OLED display touch panel at the top of the keyboard which replaces the conventional physical keys. Apple has named this as the dynamic function row. It is also rumoured that the new version will have support for touch ID and thunderbolt 3. The touch ID button will most probably be included in the power button. Currently you see the power button right aside the function keys and it will stay there as it is in the most logical position it can be in. There are other rumors afloat which suggest that the OLED touch panel will be contextual. The panel might have buttons which change upon the app in use. Martin Hajek a designer has established a mockup of the Retinal MacBook Pro as it would look with an OLED touch panel. Kuo believes that the new MacBook Pro models have the most significant upgrades Apple has ever undertaken. The new Models will also include metal injection mould made hinges and butterfly mechanism keyboards which we have seen earlier in the 12 inch MacBook. In the past we have seen rumours which stated that Apple is developing ultra thin 13 and 15 inch MacBooks but it was unclear which line did the MacBook belong to but now with the information provided by Kuo it is pretty much suggestion that the information pertains to the MacBook Pro Line. We were able to see photos in May which said to depict components for the upcoming Retina MacBook Pro. The images gave the first look of the thin body device. They included the body of the 13 inch MacBook Pro but missing were the cutouts for the function row. There was a blank space instead where the OLED is expected to be placed. The sides of the device had four USB-C ports and a singular head phone jack. It isn’t for certain that these images give us the first look to our genuine MacBook but they certainly fall in line with the rumors we have heard about the MacBook Pro till now. Specifications Apple Retina MacBook Pro updates have been out of line in the previous two years because of the delay going on with the Intel chips. Apple launched the 13 and 15 inch Retina MacBook Pro at staggering times in 2015 only due to Broadwell. In fact the 13 inch model observed an update in March and the 15 inch model in May 2015. The 13 inch Retina MacBook pro works with Broadwell chips but the 15 inch continues with its previous generation Haswell chips. Apple is still waiting for Skylake chips from Intel and this 15 inch Retina MacBook will see a higher performance boost. The appropriate Skylake chips to be included in the 15 inch Retina MacBook Pro were shown in the price lists by Intel in Mid January and the 13 inch Retina MacBook Pro appropriate chips were announced in September. These chips are sought to be available to Apple in the initial months of 2016. A new series of Xeon E3 can also be potentially used in the 15 inch Retina MacBook Pro. This can boost CPU, memory, performance and even graphics but due to pricing constraints the Core i7 Skylake chips are more likely to be Apple’s choice. The new MacBook Pros are anticipated to contain much powerful graphic cards aiming the video gamers and other professionals who are in need of GPU power.Another rumor is that there might be an option for high performance through the Polaris graphics chip which gives more power but in a slimmer package. Date of Release The initial rumors had us thinking that ultra thin 13 and 15 inch MacBook would be introduced in the second quarter of 2016 but later on rumors suggested they will not be released till fall 2016. October is the month which is thought to be the one containing the potential release date. However the latest details regarding Apple’s software masOS10.12.1 which include its release on October 7 suggest that Apple is aiming to finalize the whole package and the timeline indicates the machines will be launched in late October. The Current Available Models On march 9 2015 Apple hosted a media event name ‘Spring forward’ in which it released the updated 13 inch Retinal Mac Book Pro. The updated version contained several improvements. A new Broadwell processor was included as well as improved Intel graphics. The battery was also upgraded and a Force touch trackpad. 13 inch Retinal MacBook Pro The 13 inch Retina MacBook Pro comprises of Broadwell Processors and when compared to the old generation Haswell processors gives more improved performance and better battery life. The improved battery life is deemed to give at least 12 hours of itunes movie playback. Many internal upgrades have been made but the outer design is the same has the previous generation laptops. It has 2560x1600 wide and 227 pixel per inch Retina display. Its weight is 3.48 pounds and is approximately 0.71 inches thick. This laptop is more focused on performance rather than portability. Basic configurations are available at different prices which depend on the processor chosen as well as storage space. Processing, Graphics And Storage The Geekbench 3 benchmarks is of the opinion that the Broad well chips in the 13 inch Retina MacBook Pros’s only give a rather small advantage over their predecessors. This comes as no surprise as Broadwell is more focused on efficiency and battery life rather than simple processing power. However, in general in certain bench mark tests a 3 to 7 percent increase has been seen in performance.The 13 inch Retina MacBook Pro also comes with a upgraded Intel Iris Graphics 6100 which is thought to be a bit more faster than the GeForce 820M. You will be disappointed as there is no discrete graphics card to add in the 13 inch MackBook Pro but there is an option in the 15 inch. Apple has stated that the 2015 version of the 13 inch Retina MacBook Pro has an upgraded flash storage which is at least two times faster than the older generation machines. Certain independent tests have confirmed that the flash storage is actually faster than the older models. 15 inch Retina MacBook Pro The 15 inch Retina MacBook Pro was updated on may 19 2015 by Apple. Due to the delays made by Intel it does not feature Broadwell processors but the 2015 version does have many of the same improvements in the 13 inch Retina MacBook Pro. The 15 inch Retinal MacBook Pro also includes a Force touch track pad, it has also has improved graphics from AMD, a faster storage and a battery life of about 8 to 9 hours. Interestingly the solid state drive included in the 15 inch Retina MacBook Pro is the greatest notebook drive the company has yet introduced. It can reach speeds of about to 2GB which is almost 2.5 times more than the SSD in the older generation 15 inch Retina MacBook Pro. Non Retina MacBook Pro The non Retina MacBook Pro has not been updated by Apple and do not contain Haswell processors and thus Apple has stopped selling the 15 inch non Retina MacBook Pro but still continues to sell the 13 inch non Retina MacBook Pro. This has not updated since June 2012. The reconfiguration had a cut of dollar. Recently the non Retina MacBook Pro is almost the same price as the Retina MacBook Pro so it is likely that Apple will discontinue its production of non Retina models at some point and time.

BlueFin’s Steve Mullane reiterated a Positive rating on the company. The company ended Q3 with production down 3-4 percent sequentially, 2 percent higher than the guidance. On September 16, Intel raised its revenue guidance from $14.9 billion to $15.6 billion, attributing the increase to higher PC supply chain inventory and signs of improvement in PC demand. Related Link: Baird Raises Target Price On Intel Following Raised Guidance “We have been observing and reporting improving PC sentiment over the last several months and maintain our view that 2016 PC shipments will decline a more modest 5 percent year-on-year,” Mullane stated. Product Mix In addition, the analyst pointed out that the company has continued to increase its 14nm product mix at three of its high volume manufacturing sites, Oregon, Arizona and Ireland, while meaningfully reducing its lower node production levels at Fab 11X in New Mexico. “INTC just recently launched their 7th generation core processor called Kaby Lake last month, extending their 14nm technology node platform,” Mullane went on to say. Intel is now guiding to revenue growth of 15 percent for the September quarter, driven by momentum in the Data Center, IoT and improvement in the PC environment.

For Paris Fashion Week, designer Hussein Chalayan has teamed up with Intel to create a high-tech outfit straight out of an 80s sci-fi movie, complete with glasses that sense stress and a belt that projects live images of that data onto a wall. The glasses are running on Intel's Curie, a button-sized module designed as a low-power, versatile "brain" for wearable devices such as Chromat's dress and sports bra, which surfaced at last year's MADE Fashion Week. In this case, the smart specs determine the wearer's stress levels by monitoring biometric data such as brainwave activity via in-built EEG electrodes. There's also an optical heart rate sensor and a microphone that picks up breathing rate. With Curie's built-in Bluetooth LE, that data is sent to a connected device like a smartphone or, in this case, a belt. Rather than watch your waistline like the Welt, this one uses an Intel Compute Stick to process that information and present it visually. An embedded pico projector then throws that live interpretation of a wearer's stress levels up on a wall for all to see, which sounds like a fairly stressful situation in itself. By focusing on calming themselves down, the wearer is supposed to be able to change that imagery in real-time. Why? We're not sure, but that's seems to be a common response when you're talking about the world's bleeding-edge fashion runways – with or without an extra dollop of technology. After Paris Fashion Week wraps up, the collection will be on display from November at the "Fear and Love: Reactions to a Complex World" exhibition at the Design Museum in London.

Latest Music Tech Artists Motion Contact/About MotionTech How one community was mapping the future of visuals this summer Peter Kirn — September 28, 2016 0 There’s a shift on in the worldwide community of visualists, of the growing field of people using electronic visuals as a medium for performance, art, and inquiry. As these media become more mature and more international, there’s a renewed sense of closeness among practitioners. While big media festivals focus on novelty and show, these maker-to-maker events emphasize something else: craft. This summer seemed a particularly historic moment for not one but two tools – each of them built by small teams who make art themselves. We already covered the Berlin gathering for Isadora, the visual performance tool that has rich connections to the world of dance. Now, we get to look at TouchDesigner, which has made a name for itself as the leading go-to tool for interactive event visuals (among other things). And maybe it’s fitting that unique tools would leave a particular mark. For artists, that particular piece of software is their axe, their main instrument, something to know inside and out. I asked Isabelle Rousset from Derivative, TouchDesigner’s developer, to help prepare a report on the gathering in Moscow. And picking someone from the team here works, because these gatherings are family affairs. This is summer camp for visual nerds – a retreat for people of passion. And I was ready for an exhaustive “what did you do last summer” report. We got it, in the form of obsessive notes on what happened and endless leads to check out yourself. What TouchFest was about Moscow’s MARS Center is a hub for the city’s electronic media community – one of a handful of places everybody meets to see the latest tech and visiting artists from around the world. And in this case, that same community got their hands dirty organizing the event. Curiosity Media Lab’s Yan Kalnberzin and Eugene Afonin spear-headed the four-day event in July. It came against the backdrop of the cancellation of Outline Festival (the last afternoon of TouchFest) – but as such, was a reminder of the possibility still latent in Moscow’s scene. Here’s Derivative on the experience: It was solidly packed with masterclasses, lectures, demos, audio visual performances and a ‘marathon of interactive madness’. There was zero fluff! Derivative’s Greg Hermanovic, Markus Heckmann and Isabelle Rousset who were there to participate were blown away on many fronts: the scope, quality, range of TouchDesigner projects and applications, community engagement and support (100+ in attendance), festival programming and schedule where workshops, lectures and masterclasses ran in parallel for multiple days, the generosity and proficiency of the festival organizers for putting together such a BIG and exciting festival (while working on a major project for clients i.e. they didn’t sleep much if at all for days), the MARS Center who provided the fantastic facilities and staffing…. The volunteers and of course the performers and participants whose work and energies were very far out and intense. A ‘hotbed’ of TouchDesigner 🙂 Yan: I’m still surprised that around 250 people came)) This was a chance to learn if Moscow is ready for educational events like this. And we wanted to see how many people are really interested in the subject. I’m amazed how many people came from around Russia – three people from Krasnodar, several from Izhevsk, from Novosibirsk, and some other pretty far away cities. Ed.: Yeah – uh, Googling those myself! We are super happy and thankful to MARS Center and their technical team. They totally made half of the event. And of course to all the speakers – mostly friends, but not all of them – that they agreed to perform for free. Learning Deep in technical education. TouchFest’s organizers were themselves long-time TouchDesigner instructors. Yan Kalnberzin and Evgeniy Afonin have been teaching the tool since 2012 – even 3- and 6-month courses. These also culminated in presentations: Yan’s 2014 work, The Square Root of Sin, 2014 Exhibit Item Awakening, 2015 [Golden Mask winner] As they explain: Here at Curiosity Media Lab we often get letters about education from scratch. As we organize such an event, inviting Touch masters from Russia and abroad, we want to give you a chance to understand at least on a basic level what they are speaking about. Our 8 hour masterclass will start from the very beginning – fields of application, nodes, logic, interface, contexts of the program. Yan and Evgeniy were teaching again. Other highlights: Markus Heckmann presented an eight-hour class entitled “Developing in TouchDesigner: Python Extensions and Custom Parameters.” “The master class examined how TouchDesigner’s new Custom Parameters and Extensions helps develop complex functionality within the environment of visual programming with networks of nodes,” says Isabelle. “Probably the longest-standing” TouchDesigner user and teacher Andrew Quinn taught a course that incorporated audio and gesture, “Sound-Reactive Visuals and Gesture Tracking.” Recorded or live sound could then animate movement, light, and color – in two and three dimensions. Gesture tracking transforms the VJ “into a puppeteer.” Andrew is applying the same concept to coursework with kids. He played the closing audiovisual concert with composer Nikolai Popov and six musicians from the Russian Conservatory. Conservatory musicians join the AndrewQuinn / NikolayPopov AV performance. Total immersive interactive chaos intensive Three days in the Vostochnaya Gallery turned into a circus of interactive hacking, thanks to Ildar Yakubov (someone I’ve also had the pleasure to know). I like the chaos aspect. As Isabelle describes the event, “NEITHER SEW NOR FASTEN”: [The marathon] showed the world what pure, boundaryless and unpredictable total interactivity looks like. (At one point, I’m told, a doctor in blue scrubs came down saying he was performing an operation upstairs and the floor was shaking!) There was also a flood! But for three days the kids worked tirelessly, connecting all kinds of materials to TouchDesigner, including: Microsoft Kinect 2 Intel RealSense F200 Intel RealSense SR300 LeapMotion Arduinos with a variety of peripherials I/O devices / physical computing Servomotors LED strips Enttec Open DMX Ethernet DMX controlled devices Here’s the proposal-manifesto – slightly broken English here, sorry, but posted as-is (as maybe English can’t really describe everything they imagined)! “Artists are really suppressed with the totality of technology and this way doomed to a both senseless and endless flirting with it” – some critics say  “Until you are really familiar with the technology you are not able to reflect on it” – says the other  “Turn off that weird shit or I call the police” – say the neighbours. Armed with these tools, and using the unlimited potential Touchdesigner offers we will challenge an intuitive interface and the planned user experience. After two days, we will create a real media art gezamkunstverk and put it to the mercy of the crowd. Oh yes, about two days – the event will take place in a Hackathon mode: we will work tirelessly for two days. Some rumors say that on the second morning, participants will become familiar with the machine learning process and will learn to use this powerful tool in their practice! Tools of the interactive madness. Plotting the madness marathon. Ildar writes: For three days we have collected Krastinator – crazy device like a Rube Goldberg machine, the sole purpose of which was to stop the madness in and of itself. However, the rubber glove could not reach the big button, but successfully deceived Leap Motion posing as a real hand! The result of the analysis of the motion of non-existent bone defunct arms generate sound skeleton projected on screens, mixed with a picture of motorized cameras, controlled their own picture and includes a strobe on the floor rolled robo-ball, grazing contact microphones, vibration motor and the cooler is activated by a small Korg, smoke machine made his work, and all of this in an endless loop of interactions and relationships, secured by TouchDesigner. Such collaboration with different people and skills backgrounds very useful in every sense of the activity, a huge thank you to all participants – you are super! Lectures: praxis and philosophy Thumbing through the notes from the lecture content, what strikes me is, you could navigate the full program without ever wanting to even use TouchDesigner user and still be really happy. There’s enough content dealing with theory and general technique. Or, on the other hand, you could come to TouchFest wanting to really hone up on skills – even from scratch – and have a ball, too. To give these two areas physical space, the practical and technical were kept on downstairs and loftier topics literally above. (Nice.) I was sent pages of notes, so let me summarize. Technical 3D mapping technique with Andrew Flat, who has done everything from event design to VFX supervisor, and now is co-founder and technical director of AVEA company. https://www.facebook.com/FLaT4eRs Roman Gavrilov of Curiosity Media Lab, who has spent years researching folk traditions in Russia and Ukraine and makes the leap from traditional craft to electronic media, covered LED control software GEOPIX. http://romanesco.org SILA SVETA’s Dmitry Napolnov drew on an extensive background in events (from live motion capture to projector calibration) to present solutions to production tasks. https://www.facebook.com/cubicdisaster A roundtable discussion looked at how to present LED lighting at low costs (from DMX controllers to DIY LED). Dmitry Karpov covered the “battle” for VR, evaluating platforms and how the technology would shake up the landscape of designers. Derivative’s Greg Hermanovic looked at TouchDesigner past, present, and (possible) future, in a talk called “A playground for design, and how it got that way” Other topics: Building audiovisual instruments: advanced ways to mix human impact with algorithms, TD+Ableton+Max4Live. Anatomy of an installation Coding a pixelshader(GLSL TOP) with DAT nodes, for “raymarching” Dmitry Napolnov, lecture. Upstairs philosophy topics Procedural Functions as a New Canon – watch: Anna Titovets (Intektra), of Russia’s Plums Fest, went deep into the question of live performance. I will paste the whole description here, as I think it matters: Live video performance: from fractal tunnels to live cinema Live video performance as a social and cultural phenomenon in contemporary media art. Talk and talk about video performance as a format, which is a kind of marker for the changes occurring in today’s information society in the context of global changes taking place with the psychology of perception of the information society, with the communication methods with the audience and global technological development. How did the “vj” what “protovidzheing” Live Cinema differs from other genres, as changes in video performance linked with the development of technology and the changes taking place in society in general and in music in particular. As part of the lecture will discuss the main current stylistic trends shaping and live video performances that exist at the moment (from 8-bit to glitch and Camp aesthetics of mash-up and political videointerventsy to generativa and nonlinear narrative Live Cinema). And Isabelle’s own talk sounds fascinating: A Timeline of TouchDesigner, or, How We Got From Touch001 to Russia This talk proposes to untangle the co-joined history of TouchDesigner’s development in the context of 1. making music visuals for raves and 2. everything that followed. Isabelle will attempt to trace TouchDesigner’s development through time, technological advancements, historical events, historical achievements, grand projects, lightning bolt moments, community development and hard work. Ilya Ostrikov covered “the philosophy of digital art”: Thinking out loud, or in response to your questions: Semantics and historical review – where the legs grow .. Art as a way of expression and how to make it? As a born and where to apply? Follow the trend and whether it is now fashionable? More topics: Code as supreme and universal coauthor More speakers Vadim Epstein is a top VJ – who happens to have a background in theoretical physics and 13 years consulting for HP, to boot. Now he makes generative work with code. http://eps.here.ru Kir Hachaturov and Konstantin Novikov presented their team STRUTTURA, a generative AV performance team made up of designers, coders, media artists, and musicians, seen at venues like Moscow’s Circle of Light and Berlin’s Fashion Film Festival. https://www.facebook.com/kir.khachaturov https://www.facebook.com/konstantin.novikov.560 Alexandr Letcius of St. Petersburg’s TUNDRA collective specializes on algorithms for AV instruments and synths, with AV installation and performances. https://www.facebook.com/x.lezius Markus, lecturing.

GPUToaster™'s Blog The Technology Box Office!! FAQs 1. What the heck is a GPU? GPU or Graphics Processing Unit (also known as Graphics Card) is a specialized microprocessor that offloads the CPU and accelerates 2D/3D processing. The processor is integrated in a separate package/board which requires a PCI/PCIe slots/expansion slots.  They can be found in various embedded systems, mobile phones, PC’s, workstations and Gaming console. On the contrary current Intel Sandy Bridge/Ivy Bridge/ Haswell and Future Architectures, GPU’s have been integrated in the same CPU package making it a Unique single CPU and GPU microprocessor. But note that even though they are in same package or board, they operate independently. GPU’s are very efficient in processing complex mathematics and manipulating pixels due to their massively parallel architectures. The performance boost of executing a complex algorithm on a GPU is due to the massive number of FPUs or the Floating Point Units (responsible for carrying out operations decimal and fractions of integers, part of ALU) present. Explaining more on this is beyond the scope of FAQs. Please use search engines to know more. 2. Why your alias is GPUToaster and what does it mean? Well, if you separate GPU from Toaster, it means that toasting a GPU.😀 LOLS….It means stressing a GPU so that it becomes so hot that holding its own ground becomes a challenge for it. I do of course take care of my card. The same is achieved by OC’ing (Overclocking). OC is a technique of manipulating hardware clocks to gain extra performance out of it. It involves increasing the chip voltage by minor values which is internally handled by the OC Software and hardware drivers. Do remember that OC’ing may damage your card PERMANENTLY/reduce chipset life-time if not OC’ed properly. I personally do not recommend OC’ing for normal gamers. Please consult or ask an expert before trying it on your system. 3. Ok, You got what an OC is. But why do you OC when you know it decreases the hardware life? That’s a good question. OC does reduce your hardware life. Sometimes I do OC (sometimes playing games) during some R&D based work which demand lots of mathematical calculations per second. Or Sometimes you require to check the power of your present hardware. The configuration I have is now actually outdated. You can imagine how sometimes it is exciting experiencing and achieving performance on low-end hardware’s. OC’ing seems good at certain level. Do take care when OC’ng and don’t say I didn’t warn you.🙂 4. I don’t seem to understand the stuff you blog here. I completely agree that. There are most of the stuffs that will go/would have gone beyond your understanding. The stuff I post here are mostly real-time 3D related and are different from what the most of the visitors expected. If any topic interests you, you are free to explore them more. Gaining knowledge doesn’t harm you see! 5. Why are most of the blog posts related to 3D and graphics? I’ll precede with a disclaimer before answering this question. “Whatever I write hereon shouldn’t be made controversial.” Firstly, working and getting involved in 3D fascinates me a lot. The way the real-life is simulated in a virtual world using hardware technologies is really appreciating and challenging. It also teaches you how in real-life certain effects are reproduced, using some mathematical expressions. Plus the nature and depth of R&D in this particular domain is infinite. Secondly, this particular domain will never die or will never face depreciation though it might face some slow development in future. I’m making this statement on the basis of current trend and statistics. Thirdly, I don’t find web development, designing etc. that challenging because most of the Web process used in industries are service oriented, on the other hand 3D real-time rendering is totally R&D oriented? (No offense!) 6. How often the blog updates? Difficult to answer but you may want to check it once a day for any newer updates. Try hitting the site once in the evening. If you want to keep yourself updated, kindly subscribe to this blog and each time GPUToaster updates will be directly posted to your email account. Optionally, you can use and RSS feed software as mentioned in the later FAQs. 7. I see only posts, so how do I comment, if I want to? When you open the blog, you’ll only notice the updates. After each update you’ll find a link for “Leave comments”. Click on the link and submit your comment by providing your name and email id, optionally your home site. Your credentials are safe with wordpress.com and won’t be exposed to any one unless your consent is taken. 8. What does rating means? Is it necessary to do so? Rating is rating. You can rate a post depending on your taste. The rating system is not sophisticated, self-explanatory and is open to all. If you like the posts then please do consider and take your precious little time and a mouse click to rate them. Your rating will help me improve the stuffs I post. 9. The contact info on the “About” page seems invalid? Nice Catch!! You may notice a peculiar thing that a ‘.’ is written as DOT and @ written as AT. The main reason is to prevent SPAM. There are numerous smart and trendy SPYBOTS floating over the net. These bots scan every page and extract email ids for spamming. This method is preventive and passively reduces bot attacks. Do note that this is not a full proof method. 10. I see fewer tutorials and other contents more! Primarily, I decided to post only tutorials on this blog. I had also planned the topics for them. My aim was to present tutorials that is understood even by an amateur programmer. Designing such tutorials was taking time, rate of blogging had reduced and I finally decided to include some interesting topics. Meanwhile I prepared some tutorials and posted. By the way don’t worry, more tutorials are on their way and will hit the blog soon. The delay has introduced as I have to manage both blogging life and professional life as you see both are equally important. I appreciate your patience. 11. There are many such sites like yours, why should I take RSS feed from you? Again, it comes to personal liking. I do not force but recommend visitors to take the RSS feeds. If you like any other blog then that’s completely fine. The contents you find here are as well readily available on the internet sea. But if you find here something interesting then please do spread the word.[Update]There is a new RSS feed icon, you can use it to take regular feeds from GPUToaster’s blog if you wish to. For new users you can use a free desktop RSS reader at http://www.feeddemon.com/ 12. I have posted a legitimate comment but it requires moderation? Why a comment would need moderation? (Fight against Profanity) That’s a security measure against spammers and abusers. The comment you just posted won’t be accepted by the system. The comment is first checked by an anti-spam engine of wordpress.com. For example, any profane phrase/invalid Id/negative comments*/un-related comments, etc. if found, the same is moved to the spam list for further action. Please note that the blog is aimed to offer its visitors knowledge. Any profanity won’t be accepted and entertained here. 13. How would I search for a particular topic? On the right half of the page, there is a search text box. You can use it to search any post, phrase, sentence, topic, category, etc. Alternatively, you can browse into month-wise topic or whichever method you feel right. 14. I want to advertise something from your blog, how would I do that? As of now I have a free blog account. To be very precise, wordpress.com doesn’t allow advertisements or any user defined scripts on the blog. These limits will get removed if shifted to a server space. Well, there are no short-term plans though. GPUToaster will update you on this later. 15. I like your post and want to share with others! If you like the post then you can share with anyone; GPUToaster won’t restrict you from doing so. You can share on namely, Facebook, Twitter, Digg, Stumble-upon, Reddit. You can also mail any post and take print outs or print them to PDF,etc. “Please consider saving papers, print only when it’s required, Save Paper, Save Trees. Thank you!” 16. Can I share the tutorial source codes? Definitely! All source codes (if any) would be licensed under zlib/libpng. If at all any source is not recommended for distribution, a suitable license would be indicated/ attached. [Update] A meebo widget is added to the blog so that you can directly chat with me. If you have any other queries please do mail me or leave comments. Thank you.

SHARE IT comments See All Slides Oct 2, 2016 12:30 PM Ally Hickson Wearable technology just took a Paris runway by storm. Designer Hussein Chalayan partnered with Intel to bring wearable tech to his spring/summer 2017 fashion week show. Five models walked the runway alongside visual projections that showed their stress levels on the walls. All of it was made possible by vital information sent through the wearable tech they sported on the runway. Intel has previously partnered with Opening Ceremony and Oakley. Chalayan is no stranger to experimenting with how his clothing can engage with technology. In the past, he's created looks that changed shape with the use microchips and animatronics, made dresses embedded with LEDs, and once created a coffee table that turned into a skirt. The goal of the show, according to Intel, was to "illustrate the potential of future integrations of fashion and technology by bringing innovative concepts and aspirations to life."

October Should Be Very Exciting For Linux Enthusiasts Written by Michael Larabel in Mesa on 2 October 2016 at 10:02 AM EDT. 7 Comments While September was very exciting for Linux users, October is looking to be even more exciting with several open-source/Linux milestones expected before month's end. Among the excitement to look forward to this month includes: Linux 4.8 - This latest stable Linux kernel should be formally released today. Linux 4.9 Merge Window - As soon as Linux 4.8 is out, the two-week merge window for Linux 4.9 will open up. We've already covered some of the changes for some of the Linux 4.9 work while stay tuned to Phoronix for daily coverage of other interesting material for this next kernel version. Next Mesa Release - We should see a big release of Mesa due before month's end. This version will likely be called Mesa 13.0 and features complete OpenGL 4.4 for Intel and the Radeon/NVC0 drivers are also nearly at OpenGL 4.5. The Intel Mesa driver has all OpenGL 4.5 extensions wired in but it doesn't yet officially expose "OpenGL 4.5" until formal compliance is ensured. Potential Merging Of RADV - Related to the Mesa 13.0 release, the RADV Radeon Vulkan driver merging to mainline Mesa may be imminent. There's been a call to get this open-source Radeon Vulkan driver merged in time for this next release. Ubuntu 16.10 - Ubuntu 16.10 is being released in less than two weeks for those interested in the Yakkety Yak. X.Org Server 1.19 - X.Org Server 1.19 is expected to debut this month with threaded input support, better XWayland, improvements to GLAMOR 2D acceleration, and more. Fedora 25 Getting Buttoned Up For Release - Development on Fedora 25 will be finishing up for its debut in mid-November. Fedora 25 may end up being the first tier-one Linux distribution shipping with Wayland by default. GNOME 3.24 Development Heating Up - With GNOME 3.22 out the door, GNOME 3.24 development is heating up. GTK will be merging the GTK Scene Kit this cycle, continued Wayland improvements are expected, and other Linux desktop improvements. KDE Plasma 5.8 - Plasma 5.8 is expected to be released this week with many improvements and will be the first Long-Term Support release of Plasma 5. Anything else to get excited about this month?

The facial recognition aspect of Windows Hello was shown off nearly every time Microsoft got on stage for demos and it always got a very positive responses. Then the dots were connected between Windows 10 and the Intel RealSense Dev Kit for the camera hardware and suddenly we could now put Windows Hello's facial recognition to the test on our own systems. The video demo I did last July has garnered over 147,000 views to prove that everyday users are very interested in having this whiz bang technology at their disposal. However, unless you were buying new hardware with the RealSense camera technology built in then Windows Hello facial recognition remained out of reach. It is just shocking to realize that no third party hardware manufacturers were publicly planning to release a compatible Windows Hello camera/webcam to meet that demand. Then at CES 2016 we heard that two companies were planning on releasing hardware to support Windows Hello and facial recognition. One was Razer's Stargazer and the other one was from MouseComputer. Well, since then I have not heard anything about the MouseComputer offering but the Razer StarGazer is now shipping after being offered for pre-order in early September. Those pre-orders have now been shipping for the last week or so and I had one waiting for me when I returned from Microsoft Ignite. These images will show you the unboxing experience but the setup of the device is all hands off. Once the drivers were downloaded by the Device Manager the camera was ready to go. I quickly setup Windows Hello Facial recognition and the device logged me in right from the Lock Screen in my first test. The USB 3.0 camera fully supports Windows Hello as expected but is also a full HD 1080p webcam with several other features: Ultra-high 60 frames per second capture optimized for streaming (720p max) Max 1080p HD video capture Automatic noise cancelling dual array mic Dynamic Background Removal 3D scanning Facial/gesture recognition The product specifications, in other words what your PC needs to have to support this device, looks like this: 6th generation Intel Core processor PC with a free USB 3.0 port 8GB of free hard disk space DirectX 9.0 Intel® HD graphics Windows® 10 4GB memory Internet connection By the way, I am using this camera on an AMD based home built system without any issues so it would seem the Intel Core Processor is not a deal killer but I can conform that a USB 3.0 port is necessary due to the data bandwidth it needs. In the box you will find: Stargazer Camera Eight foot braided USB 3.0 cable User Manual Razer Stickers The camera has a built in adjustable clip to easily fit it on top of any monitor or you can use a tripod with the threaded mount.   Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Related Media Review: Xiaomi Mi5s 4G Smartphone Blade Surface Book Lock Review: PDP Energizer 2X Smart Charger for Xbox One Review: PDP Talon Media Remote for Xbox One Review: iDeaUSA s408 Gaming Headphones Review: CHUWI HI10 PLUS Tablet PC The Other Surface Hardware Announced at #MicrosoftEvent The Eve V - A Crowd Designed Windows 10 2-in-1 Device Review: IdeaUSA 20W Stereo Wireless Portable Speaker with Mi… Hands On: Tough Tested Earbuds and 8000 mAh Powerbank Discuss this Gallery 1 Nevada on Oct 3, 2016 Mine should be arriving today.

SEND ANOTHER EMAIL CLOSE share This Is What's Really Going on With Corporate Blockchain Adoption (and What Could Happen Soon) 2.4K Ash Egan and Maia Heymann - General Partner, Converge Venture Partners 10/3/16 @1:56pm in Tech 10/3/16 @1:56pm In our first post on blockchain adoption, Converge investors Ash Egan and Maia Heymann discuss blockchain: Bitcoin vs. blockchain and balancing risk with potential. This piece analyzes the barriers for blockchain and what to expect from corporate buyers. Corporations are still in the preliminary phases of exploring blockchain technology, contrary to headlines hyping the technology’s potential, and advances. Financial institutions are most interested as buyers of the technology, and are exploring dozens of use cases with varying degrees of traction. However, most corporate blockchain exploration is happening under a shroud of secrecy and decisions are kept under a tight lid, so the actual progress of corporate use cases remains largely unclear. Because corporations’ generic public comments (mostly around theoretical impact) do not represent corporate blockchain adoption,  we’re providing our take with four serious considerations around adoption. Early Experimentation One can investigate blockchain interest in two ways: reviewing blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) customers, and deciphering business development activity by consortia like R3, Hyperledger, Project Bletchley, and Paxos (previously ItBit). U.S. based corporations are cognizant of the regulatory environment and as a result almost exclusively look into the permissions space, also refereed to as private blockchains, that would replace expensive and complicated systems. BaaS customers and consortia members are predominantly U.S. banks, while the list is growing and R3 recently added newcomers like China Merchant Bank and insurance behemoth, Metlife. R3 is receiving the most traction in the consortia world and currently has two main tracks for corporate customers: Blockchain Development Initiative with around 50 banks and the other is Reference Data Management pilots with about a dozen banks. As the head of innovation controlling a moderate budget, it makes sense to invest $250,000 as an entrance fee to explore R3’s offerings. Other consortia include Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger, which is in development phase, and open sources its platform for enterprises to contribute code. Hyperledger focuses on bridging blockchain-based distributed ledgers to business transactions; Intel, Accenture and JP Morgan have joined as members. Another consortium to consider is Project Bletchley, which Microsoft released in June. Paxos, formerly ItBit (focused on OTC trading services) recently made a pivot into the private blockchain space, specifically to gold settlements. Consortia efforts come in many forms; the "Big Four" accounting firms are even exploring their own blockchain consortium. BaaS providers like Blockstack, Chain and Multi-chain represent another wave of companies exploring blockchain implementation: Blockstack, Chain and Multi-chain. BaaS adoption (and momentum) is even less transparent than consortia, where players like Chain keep their relationship details close to the chest. A number of companies have announced partnerships with Chain, but beyond instances similar to Nasdaq’s interest in using Chain for issuing shares in pre-IPO companies, progress and general involvement are not clear. Beyond BaaS and consortia, some corporates are exploring hybrid (permissioned and permissionless) systems like Ripple. Ripple plans to sell banks XRP, which is its currency for liquidity and will offer Ripple Connect to hopefully alleviate costs and increase system speed. Four Considerations for Corporate Adoption We examined existing frameworks for how enterprises adopt new technologies and concluded that blockchain adoption warrants a different set of considerations. Here, we highlight the four focus areas that large corporations should consider before and during exploration phase: 1. Delivering on promise: cost savings, security It seems like a Blockchain for X world in which Blockchain is the hammer, and everything is a nail. In early 2016, Jeremy Drane from PwC (now with Libra) said “there are only a small number of industry companies that can deliver solutions built on the technology – the industry is not as diverse as you’d hope.” Blockchain applications must meet the buyer, market, and system demands. As a rule of thumb, corporate buyers will not switch systems unless they see a 10x improvement in performance in new solution. For context, VisaNet, Visa’s transaction processing system averages 2,000 transactions per second, with capacity to reach 56,000 transactions per second; compare this to Bitcoin at seven transactions per second, according to “On Scaling Decentralized Blockchains.” Ethereum’s system is faster than Bitcoin’s, but is not ready to replace VisaNet or comparable systems. Changing systems is complicated. Financial institutions rely on on-premise systems that have been in play for decades, known for their security, but also their inability for data sharing (intra and interbank). Hyperledger’s Donna Dillenberger said “to ensure that blockchain is truly enterprise-ready for different verticals and different applications with different rules, more security and compliance issues must be firmly addressed…it’s technically challenging to add the needed security and compliance layers, as well as new sophisticated features, to blockchain to optimize it for enterprise use. Here at IBM it took many months to do the work thus far. So adapting it to many different use cases and applications takes a while.” Takeaway: A meaningful percentage of blockchain use cases will fail to gain traction for various reasons (security, upkeep, unrealistic expectations) in the current exploratory climate. Migration costs will become more tangible, and corporations will be more defined about their blockchain interest – and, it’s not unreasonable to estimate that this exploratory phase could last half a decade. As corporates refine their view on distributed ledger technology, it’s a win-win for FI’s and entrepreneurs because the blockchain movement is drawing hyper intelligent folks to unsexy business problems. Related MIT Media Lab Is Launching a New Bitcoin Research Initiative 2. Corporate politics/internal buy-in “I don’t want to be the guy who misses out, but I also don’t want to stick my neck out to far to be fired.” This sentiment is a common trend amongst corporate blockchain folks - being the blockchain champion within a large and complex organization is not easy, balancing the media’s hype fest with real business solutions. As a large corporation, it’s difficult to innovate, and pressure for results often leads to misalignment between executives and blockchain champions. Without citing a reason, UBS and its blockchain chief parted ways in recent months. Others, like IBM, realize there will be failure, so recruiting blockchain talent and creating a forward thinking culture has been the computing giant’s strategy. The company will create a new unit called Watson Financial Services to encompass Watson, cloud, and all blockchain-related offerings and strategy, and will be led by Bridget van Kralingen, IBM’s senior VP of global banking services and Mark Foster, formerly from Accenture. Takeaway: Corporate innovation groups need influence to pilot and expand use cases, paired with sufficient senior management buy-in, patience, and budget resources. Exploration will take more than the $250,000 R3 entrance fee to understand if a blockchain solution works. 3. Regulatory roadblocks/concerns Regulation around Bitcoin has progressed the way we might’ve expected: slowly. Slow-moving governing bodies are keeping corporates at bay, and reporting regulations outlined in Dodd Frank and Europe’s equivalent, EMIR create friction in linking capital markets and blockchain technology – leading to risk in adopting blockchain technology even steeper. In the U.S., corporates are almost exclusively exploring private (permissioned) blockchains due to restrictive wording in Dodd Frank around reporting. Still behind Europe, some U.S. politicians are pushing for blockchain exploration like Mick Mulvaney and Jared Polis, who announced the creation of a “Blockchain Caucus” last week. Europe has been more transparent, and fast moving on blockchain regulation, and in June released “The Distributed Ledger Technology Applied to Securities Markets” on the relevance of distributed ledger tech. One firm in the Northeast told us top blockchain talent could essentially, “name their salary.” Takeaway: Blockchain regulatory conditions will improve as decision-makers, governing agencies, influencers and regulators understand the technology, and its tradeoffs. We expect Europe to lead the charge, and countries like Estonia (quickly becoming the fintech hotbed), with the United States to follow. Economist, Carlo Meijer analyses the intricacies of blockchain regulation in “Blockchain, Financial Regulatory Reporting and Challenges.” 4. Blockchain Talent There is a shortage of blockchain talent: business folks, engineers, strategists, and individuals who understand blockchain technology adoption. In March, PwC, Deloitte, and KPMG announced their intent on hiring blockchain talent, but are realizing there is a talent shortage. Big banks like JPMorgan, BofA, Capital One are staffing up, and feeling the pain as well. In August, we heard frustration from Japanese banks on attracting experts via Reuters. Hiring, attracting and training blockchain talent is highly competitive, and organizations are paying up. One firm in the Northeast told us top blockchain talent could essentially, “name their salary.” Takeaway: Hiring blockchain talent is hard (and expensive). There are only a couple hundred people in the world who truly understand the intricacies and implementation of blockchain technology, cryptocurrency, distributed ledgers, capital markets, existing systems and the many areas blockchain technology will touch. Expect universities to invest in curriculum and recruit professors over the next couple years, similar to the objectives of Cornell’s IC3 and MIT’s Media Lab Digital Currency Initiative. Jerry Cuomo, IBM’s VP of blockchain, comments on blockchain’s current environment “at some level, the efficiency you get from blockchain is to create more of a B2B service without the friction. And many financial services companies are the friction in the system, by design.” At Converge, we have noticed this disconnect between startups and corporate objectives, and decision makers. Entrepreneurs, Consortia, BaaS providers, and corporate thoughts leaders are closing this gap and leveraging Cloud infrastructure and the ubiquitous compute power of today. This movement allows for an entirely new way of processing transactions: touching capital, data, and even applications. With two blockchain investments in Cambridge and NYC, we’re scanning the environment for more companies that will bridge existing infrastructure to this new frontier.

In terms of specs, the Ideapad Y700 is fueled by an Intel Core i7 processor, NVIDIA GTX 960M 4 GB GDDR5 GPU, and up to 16GB of RAM. Lenovo is bundling a gaming kit made up of accessories like a mechanical mouse, gaming mouse, armored backpack, and special headset along with the notebook. It claims the package is worth Rs 19496, but plans to sell it at Rs 2999. Moving on to the less expensive Yoga 510 and Yoga 710, the devices are set to be available at Rs 40990 and Rs 85490, respectively. The 2-in-1 laptops continue the 360-degree tradition of the Yoga series, allowing consumers to bend the gadget in various modes like tent or tablet. This time round, the Yoga 510 is lighter and has been blessed with fast charging capabilities, the new Intel 7th Gen Core i5 processor, and a revamped design. As for the new entries in the Ideapad series, the 510s and 710s are lightweight notebooks carved out of aluminum and magnesium priced at Rs 51090 and Rs 73390, respectively.

We like it, that's what 3 Oct 2016 at 16:03, Chris Mellor Chris Mellor Get email alert when this author posts Common Topics Emc, Netapp, Seagate, Hp, Dell Recent Articles IBM stirs Lenovo Optane into its Bluemix cloud Scality developing way to stream objects to tape and the cloud Salesforce backup = Druva Comment HPE's Synergy is, it thinks, the next great advance in servers and is far more capable than hyper-converged infrastructure systems, being able to provision bare metal as well as servers for virtual workloads as well as containerised ones. Getting a grip on this beast is tricky. Is it a form of dynamically reconfigurable hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) with separately scalable compute, storage and networking? Yes, in a way it is, but HPE would position it apart from HCI, as we shall see later. The basic Synergy element is a 10U rackmount chassis, somewhat similar to its C-Class chassis but taking specific servers, not standard ones. This chassis can take a mix of server and storage frames which slot in from the front and has a set of network nodes at the back, with a single master node. These nodes obviate the need for a separate top of rack networking switch. The chassis also has a front-mount Composer, a dedicated server with storage and networking. This runs a version of Linux, auto-discovers Synergy compute, storage and networking (fabric) elements, and provides the OneView command facility for managing Synergy. Front and rear views of Synergy rack. At the rear the blue cables interconnect Composer modules in each frame Synergy frames can scale out, with four per rack, if your floors can stand the weight, and then via adding another rack. The Composers in each Synergy chassis hook up with each other via a dedicated management net, providing a control plane for the system separate from the operational compute and data plane. HPE UK's FSI Strategic Accounts Presales Consultant Joe Hardy with Synergy Composer module. Composer module with lid removed. Users set up named server profiles, defining compute, firmware, OS, storage and networking resources for example, and then these can be simply provisioned to workloads: for example, a database workload template. Synergy can be managed through RESTful APIs as well. Synergy OneView 3 screenshot. Note server profile area middle left. Server nodes can have direct-attached on-blade storage. This can be, for example, SAS 2.5-inch disk or NVMe SSDs. As well as the in-frame storage nodes Synergy chassis' can use external SAN or NAS storage, such as 3PAR StorServe, connected by Fibre Channel or Ethernet, part or all of which gets allocated to the Synergy storage resource pool via, say, volumes allocated to workloads running on Synergy. Both Synergy storage and networking are virtualised into Synergy-wide pools and compute blades can be aggregated for a workload. But individual CPUs on a server blade can't be separately dedicated to workloads with other server nodes; the server blade is as granular as compute gets for now. Similarly memory can't be separately virtualised into a Synergy-wide pool. When Intel's Silicon Photonics is adopted by Synergy in the future then this, with operating system help, might become possible. Joe Hardy showing Synergy server node with lid removed. As servers adopt non-volatile storage-class memory then Synergy will adopt them too via Synergy server blades using non-volatile Memristor, XPoint or some other media technology. It will also adopt HPE's developing Machine concept, with Synergy in one sense, being a Machine precursor. Server inventiveness HPE says it has some 100 beta customers testing Synergy. As you look at the hardware, the 10U chassis and its components, the Composer module and the OneView v3 software, you realise this is a substantial and distinctive effort. A lot of development money is being spent here. No other server vendor has anything like Synergy; not Cisco, not Dell, not Fujitsu, Hitachi, Huawei, Lenovo nor any other mainstream server vendor you can think of. Paul Miller, HPE’s marketing VP for Converged Data Centre Infrastructure, bangs the HPE server inventiveness drum, saying HPE was first with x86 servers, first with a 1U pizza box-format server, first to launch blade servers, and is now the first to launch composable infrastructure servers. Everyone else, he says, including Dell, follows HPE. Synergy storage module. Synergy and HCI Hyper-converged infrastructure systems converged and integrate server, storage and networking with server virtualisation software to apps in virtual machines in a scale-out system environment using virtual SAN software, such as VMware’s VSAN. HPE has its hyper-converged HC 380 product, ones that use StoreVirtual virtual SAN software and ProLiant DL380 servers. Synergy opens up that idea, expands on it, to have a Synergy frame as the basic element, within which you can mix and match variable compute, server and network elements. The HCIA single SKU buying simplicity goes away but the operational flexibility and simplicity benefits gained instead could be huge, quite apart from Synergy providing bare-metal servers as well as support for containerisation. Also Synergy is built as a platform with a10 year-plus life. Different compute, storage and networking elements and technologies can come along and be adopted by the Synergy chassis and software; that’s the theory. So, for example, Intel’s Silicon Photonics can be adopted inside Synergy, and also outside. Once the3PAR StorServe arrays get Silicon Photonics support then Synergy links to external storage will run at 100Gbit/s speed. How this would work alongside or with NVMe over Fabrics is unclear. It could simply be an alternative to 100Gbit/s Ethernet cables and still carry Ethernet protocol signals and data, in which case NVMeF running across Silicon Photonics cables will be theoretically okay. Innovation buzzwordery? Yes – and no Synergy is a multi-million dollar investment by HPE involving server, storage and networking hardware, adapted C-Class chassis, development of the Composer module, and extension of the OneView management software facility, Looking at the racks of Synergy hardware and nodes within the frames it’s obvious that this is a big iron effort. The thing looks like a software-defined private cloud, mini data centres in 10U cans with dynamically re-usable elements. Marketing buzzwordery surrounds it; infrastructure as code, the ideas economy, innovating fearlessly in an age of business disruption, IT must build innovation engines, and IT must become value creators and deliver business outcomes. Synergy is about accelerating the digital enterprise to innovate fearlessly. There’s even a Composable Infrastructure for Dummies book – no, really – which tells you how to turn your data centre into an a revenue generator with composable infrastructure. But step aside from this slick deluge of wordsmithing and Synergy looks pretty damn good. Will it take off? That’s the question, and HPE is giving its best shot, pouring EVPs into marketing events and demo’ing the hardware. If the operational flexibility, CAPEX and OPEX benefits are real and replicable from customer to customer then HPE will have a good and distinctive story to tell and pass through its channel. And Meg Whitman will have product technology to smile about. ® Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 19 Comments More from The Register France, I am in you, says HPE's EMEA channel overlord Gilles Thiebaut says oui oui to country manager's job HPE buffs OpenStack cloud to woo public-shy types OpenStack Summit Helion a 'real environment for production' HPE: Come on in, cool cloud kids, we won't compete with you – unlike *cough* Dell Service providers lured in with promises 7 Comments HPE to offer hybrid cloud hypermarket to world+dog Not just Europeans who'll consume Cloud 28+ 2 Comments The man running HPE's Microsoft Azure biz says shiz this... after eight months Former channel czar John Ansell is about to leave the building 5 Comments HPE, IBM, ARM, Samsung and pals in plot to weave 'memory fabric' Everyone but Intel and Cisco working together to build storage-class memory 3 Comments Whitepapers The value of cloud partner ecosystems Channel partners leverage cloud ecosystems to maximise growth Enabling the Digital Workforce Optimising the employee experience in the digital age Customer analytics for Dummies Ebook OpenStack is ready — are you?

The Linux Foundation The Git distributed revision control system is splendid in a multitude of ways but one -- keeping a good history of patches and commits. Pish tosh, you say, for Git remembers everything! Yes, it does, until you rebase. To solve this problem, Josh Triplett, built a new tool called git-series, which he described in his talk at ContainerCon North America. In his entertaining talk, Triplett, ChromeOS Architect at Intel, goes into a good level of detail on why he wrote git-series and how it works. First, why is it even necessary? Can't you just merge everything and never rebase? You can, though, as Triplett says, "You're actually going to go back and rewrite history as though you had done it that way to begin with. The reason you do that is so that then when you send the stack of patches, that stack of patches as merged into the public history will look like a reasonable series of development changes that make sense. As opposed to seeing a pull request that says, "Implement the feature, fix the thing I just implemented. Fix it some more. Maybe it'll work this time." You don't want to see that in your public history even though that is what you actually did." It is reasonable for a project to require a clean public history, and you can have as mucky a private history as you like. But Git is all about working with other people. Triplett describes a typical scenario: "Development proceeds on from there and maybe you have to do a v3, v4, v5 but what happened to version 1? Did you save a copy of it anywhere? Do you still have it? Somebody makes an offhand comment, ‘I liked the way you did this in v1 better.’ They want to see the history of development. The real history of development and not the lovely curated history." So then you're digging through emails, git reflog or branching your project until it looks like hallucinogenic spaghetti. "You might have a branch named feature v1, which was probably named feature and then you renamed it feature v1 when you realized you needed a v2. Then you have a v3 with that typo fix, and a v8 rebased on top of 4.6 with Alice's fix incorporated. We have a version control system. We should be past this," Triplett said. Git-series is an elegant solution that tracks a patch series and its evolution through your project, and it works seamlessly with all Git features. According to Triplett, "Git-series tracks the history of a patch series, how you've changed it through non-fast-forwarding changes. You can rewrite history and it will keep track of what the old history looked like, including a commit message telling you what you were doing. It tracks a cover letter so that you can version that over time. It tracks the base that you started your series from to make it easy to rebase this." Watch Triplett's presentation (below), which includes a live demo of git-series in action. Want to learn more about Git?

Initially GlobalFoundries will continue to use deep ultraviolet (DUV) argon fluoride (ArF) excimer lasers with 193 nm wavelength with its 7 nm production process, but over time it hopes to insert extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) tools into production flow should their customers need this. Keeping in mind that one of GF’s key customers is AMD, the foundry’s advancements in manufacturing technologies are quite important for the PC market in general. Tangible Improvements Over 14LPP GlobalFoundries will use its 7 nm production process to produce high-performance components, such as CPUs, GPUs and SoCs for various applications (mobile, PC, servers, etc.). In general, it means that a number of future products from AMD could be produced using GlobalFoundries’ 7 nm fabrication tech, something we already knew from the wafer supply agreement that the two companies inked earlier this year. Compared to GlobalFoundries’ current leading-edge 14LPP fabrication technology, the initial DUV-only 7 nm process promises over 50% area reduction as well as over 60% power reduction (at the same frequency and complexity) or over 30% performance improvement (at the same power and complexity). In practice, this means that in an ideal scenario GlobalFoundries will be able to double the amount of transistors per chip without increasing its die size while improving its performance per watt characteristics. The company plans to "significantly" re-use equipment and processes it utilizes now for volume production of chips using the 14 nm FinFET technologies for its 7 nm node. Nonetheless, the new process will require an additional multi-billion investment in Fab 8. As of now, GlobalFoundries has already started to produce test wafers with circuits (IP) from a number of its customers using the 7 nm process in its Fab 8 in Malta, New York. While the company decision to skip 10nm means that it will not be able to use 10nm as a stepping-stone to 7 nm technology, it says that it has gained a lot of experience with FinFETs from the 14LPE and the 14LPP processes. The contract maker of semiconductors expects to finalize specs of its 7 nm technology in the second half of 2017, which implies on start of mass production of commercial chips in the second half of 2018. GlobalFoundries naturally does not reveal timeframes for its 7nm with EUV, but it is safe to say that EUV will be used in 2019 at the earliest. While GlobalFoundries’ expectations for performance, power, area (PPA) improvements look solid, it should be noted that right now the contract manufacturer is among what's become multiple companies to have confirmed their intentions to pursue a DUV-only 7 nm process technology. DUV in this respect is the tried and true approach, however in order to create 7 nm features it will require using triple/quadruple patterning, which greatly increases design and manufacturing costs as well as cycle times over previous-gen nodes. So while there is a lot of interest in using EUV if it works, many of the major fabs are starting at the same place as GlobalFoundries and at least internally preparing for DUV-only, while hoping EUV will be ready when they want it. Case in point, Samsung currently hopes to use EUV lithography for critical layers with their 7 nm nodes to avoid triple/quadruple patterning, but are being very careful in how they're wording their plans, saying that they are "reviewing possibilities" of EUV insertion at 7 nm. So it is not cast in stone that Samsung will not proceed with a DUV-only 7 nm if it has to. Meanwhile Intel also once considered to start using EUV for 7 nm. Finally, TSMC does not seem to be afraid of multi-patterning and intends to produce semiconductors using DUV-only 7 nm manufacturing tech in 2H 2018. It remains to be seen how GlobalFoundries’ and TSMC’s 7 nm processes play out, but keep in mind that the former claims that its 7 nm platform is designed to be “EUV-compatible at key levels”. This means that the company will start using ASML’s TWINSCAN NXE step-and-scan systems for critical layers once they are ready (i.e., their light sources will be powerful enough for mass production and the tools will have more than 80% availability). Since GF's 7 nm with EUV process technology will be used to produce a generation of ICs (integrated circuits) that will follow the initial 7 nm chips, GlobalFoundries makes no secret that the 7 nm with DUV and the 7 nm with EUV are essentially two different process generations (keep in mind that specs of either have not been finalized). Moreover, if EUV is ready for prime time in 2019, GF's 7 nm DUV will be a short-lived node. In fact, GlobalFoundries is already using TWINSCAN NXEs and EUV to speed up prototyping of certain circuits for its clients. GlobaFoundries Skips 10 nm For Two Reasons Having announced its 7 nm manufacturing technology, GlobalFoundries confirmed rumors that it decided to skip the 10 nm fabrication process. It looks like there are at least two reasons for this decision and both lie in the PPASC (power, performance, area, schedule and costs) equation. On the one hand, the company figured out that the PPA advantages of its 10 nm technology over its 14LPP process would not be significant. On the other hand, its schedule and costs would further hinder its competitiveness. Now, let’s talk about this in a bit more detailed way. Since manufacturing technologies are getting more complex, it is not easy to ensure that every new node offers substantial power, performance and area improvements (PPA) over the previous one. As a result, some process technologies are only used by fabless designers of semiconductors for a couple of years, whereas others are used by dozens of companies for many years. GlobalFoundries believes that 10 nm process would not provide tangible performance, power and area advantages over 14LPP process technology (which is based on 20 nm back-end-of-line interconnect flow) and would become a short-lived transitional node, hence their reason to skip it. We have seen a few such nodes in the recent years: as a limited number of firms used 45 nm, 32 and 20 nm process technologies, albeit all for different reasons. If we take a look at the advertised PPA improvements for the most recent leading-edge process technologies from GF, Samsung and TSMC, it will be clear that transition to 10 nm node will bring improvements to TSMC's abilities, but not by a large enough degree to satisfy all of its customers (we observed something similar with the CLN20SOC several years ago). Moreover, Samsung's numbers are somewhat less impressive (keep in mind that GF's 14LPP was licensed from Samsung), confirming GlobalFoundries expectations. Advertised PPA Improvements of Leading Edge Process Technologies Data announced by companies during conference calls, press briefings and in press releases   GlobalFoundries Samsung TSMC 7nm DUV vs 14LPP 14LPP vs 28LPP 10LPE vs 14LPP 10LPP vs 10LPE 20SOC vs 28 nm 16FF+ vs 28HPM 16FF+ vs 20SOC 10FF vs 16FF+ 7FF vs 10FF Power >60% 60% 30% none 25% 70% 60% 40% <40% Performance >30% 40% >10% >10% 30% 65% 40% 20% - Area Reduction >50% 50% 32% none <50% ~50% none >50% >37% To a degree, GlobalFoundries seems to be at least partially right in its thinking of 10 nm as of a transitional node. Only three customers have taped out their 10 nm chips at TSMC so far, less than six months before TSMC intends to get its first 10 nm revenue (in Q1 2017). By contrast, tens of companies taped out their 16 nm (CLN16FF) products long before the start of high-volume production in the second half of 2015. What is more important is that according to TSMC, its 10 nm fabrication process will be mostly used by mobile SoC developers (read: Apple, Qualcomm, MediaTek), which desperately need to squeeze more transistors into new chips every year, improve performance and reduce power consumption by a bit too. Such customers are less concerned about manufacturing costs and aggressive improvements, they simply need new technologies to make certain progress due to market demands. Meanwhile, TSMC’s 7 nm manufacturing technology will be used by multiple customers of the company, including those from high-performance computing space, the company said recently (it does not mean, though, that nobody from HPC space is going to use 10 nm). TSMC plans to start volume production of 7 nm chips in the first half of 2018, so, it is a little bit ahead of GlobalFoundries with this node. However, its first EUV-based process technology (5 nm) is scheduled for 2020, so, the company might be a little behind its rival when it comes to next-gen lithography. Samsung demonstrated the first wafers processed using its 10LPE (10 nm, low-power early) technology in May, 2015, and disclosed plans to start volume production of chips using its 10 nm tech in late 2016. In addition, the company is planning to quickly roll-out an improved version of the tech called 10LPP, the company said earlier this year. Since Samsung needs to produce leading-edge SoC for its smartphones, it is not surprising that it is also deploying 10 nm fabrication processes: even in case it does not have a lot of foundry customers for them, it is going to need them itself to stay competitive against Apple (and potentially land Apple as a foundry client). Moreover, if Samsung requires EUV for its 7 nm process technology, it will have to use 10 nm before ASML is ready with its commercial EUV step-and-scan systems. In fact, this is why Samsung does not reveal whether it expects to start making chips using 7 nm process in 2019 or later. Meanwhile, there is another reason why GlobalFoundries decided to skip the 10 nm fabrication technology (in addition to insignificant performance and area advantages over the 14LPP). Back in 2014, the company acquired assets of IBM Microelectronics along with a team of developers. Naturally, the integration of IBM staff took time, so instead of creating a 10 nm manufacturing process (which would be late anyway), the company decided to focus on its 7 nm technology platform. The latter will be the first process developed by the team consisting of GF and IBM developers. Finally, keep in mind that while makers of semiconductors use terms like 7 nm or 10 nm to name their fabrication technologies, such numbers nowadays do not necessary reflect transistor density and other factors. Not all 10 nm manufacturing technologies are created equal. For example, Intel argues that transistor density of its 10 nm process is going to be comparable to transistor densities of competing 7 nm technologies. Nonetheless, a new node is still a new node with its own advantages compared to its direct, in-house predecessor. Smooth Transition to EUV Nowadays both semiconductor makers and manufacturers of production equipment agree that EUV will be required to make chips using smaller fabrication technologies, and the question is whether ASML will be ready with viable tools for 7 nm or for 5 nm nodes. As a result, everyone has to make decisions about when to start using EUV scanners for critical layers. Leading-Edge Industry Lithography Roadmap, Mass Production Data announced by companies during conference calls, press briefings and in press releases   2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 1H 2H 1H 2H GlobalFoundries 14LPP 7 nm DUV 7nm with EUV exact timing not announced Intel 14 nm 14 nm+ 10 nm no data Samsung 14LPP 14LPC 10LPE 10LPP 7LPP (7nm with EUV) exact timing not announced SMIC 28 nm 14 nm in development TSMC CLN16FF+ CLN16FFC CLN10FF CLN7FF unknown 5 nm EUV UMC 28 nm 14 nm no data ASML and Cymer are making a steady progress with their EUV tools and manufacturers of semiconductors are learning how to use those tools. So far, only TSMC has publicly announced plans to use EUV for commercial 5 nm chips in 2020. Samsung has publicly mulled over using EUV tools for its 7 nm semiconductors, but it does not specify when. GlobalFoundries said that it could use EUV for its 7 nm manufacturing technology, but also did not specify exact timing. Intel is still weighing its options, hence, it is still possible that the company will start to use EUV for its 7 nm fabrication process. Meanwhile, SMIC and UMC have not specified their plans concerning next-gen lithography. In fact, both companies yet have to catch up with their rivals when it comes to FinFET first. By developing a 7 nm process technology “compatible with EUV at key levels”, which essentially means two generations of the fabrication process, GlobalFoundries plays it safe: Firstly, it will have an all new process technology ready for production in 2H 2018. It is several months later than TSMC, but is still ahead of Intel and such manufacturing tech advantage could be good for AMD as well as other customers of GlobalFoundries (but bear in mind increased costs and cycle times). Secondly, once EUV tools are ready for prime time, GlobalFoundries will have a proven and polished-off process technology ready for EUV insertion (keep in mind that 193 nm ArF tools will be used for the majority of layers for a long time). Thirdly, even if ASML’s tools are not ready by 2H 2019 (something that its clients will learn well ahead of that timeframe), GlobalFoundries will have a competitive node and time to develop its next process with, or without EUV. Of course, in certain circumstances GlobalFoundries may end up competing against TSMC’s 5 nm EUV technology with its 7 nm manufacturing process in 2020, but this is something the company is going to try to avoid. GlobalFoundries to Offer EUV and FD-SOI GlobalFoundries does not put all eggs in one basket. While companies like TSMC and Samsung develop low-cost/low-power versions of their FinFET manufacturing technologies in a bid to attract smaller players, GF also plans to keep developing new planar fabrication processes featuring FD-SOI. Therefore, for cost effective, low power and radio applications, the company will keep using its 22FDX (it uses back-end-of-line interconnect flow of STMicroelectronics’ 28nm FD-SOI as well as front-end of line of STM’s 14nm FD-SOI process technology) and eventually 12FDX technologies (also announced this month). Since it is considerably cheaper to design chips featuring planar transistors, these technologies are going to be used by various smaller fabless semiconductor developers. In general, GlobalFoundries positions its 22FDX as an alternative for 14/16 nm FinFET technologies, whereas the 12FDX is going to compete against 10 nm and, possibly, sub-10 nm processes in 2019 and beyond. Samsung, another FD-SOI backer, plans to add eNVM (embedded non-volatile memory) to its 28FDS platform in 2018, but so far it has not announced any plans for a new FD-SOI technology platform.  It remains to be seen is how successful the FD-SOI offerings from GlobalFoundries will be, given the competition. Nonetheless, GlobalFoundries and Samsung are the only contract makers of semiconductors, which have announced plans to offer both leading-edge FinFET as well as planar FD-SOI manufacturing processes in 2020 and beyond. Moreover, GlobalFoundries is the only company, who disclosed plans for a sub-20 nm FD-SOI fabrication technology.

Reply ddriver - Monday, October 03, 2016 - link I am great, but glofo won't be when they fail to deliver and in 2019 the best they could offer is 14 nm lines. Intel is pretty much the leader in process, and even they don't do stupid things like going ahead of themselves, in fact they have switched process transition to a lower gear. It is highly unrealistic that glofo, the sloth of the semiconductor business, will succeed. That's not playing it safe, that putting all your eggs in a basket you can't deliver. Playing it safe would be baby steps, not skipping node leaps. Reply ddriver - Monday, October 03, 2016 - link Best case scenario IMO is that it will be more like Intel's 10 nm, but will call it 7 cuz it sounds better. That should be achievable at least. Let's face it, glofo's 14nm came almost 2 years late and wasn't exactly stellar as polaris efficiency has revealed. Reply Morawka - Monday, October 03, 2016 - link GF had working 7nm silicon over a year ago (in partnership with IBM), it's not so far fetched. Intel has fallen behind and they used to have a full 2 year lead, not so much anymore. I would be worried if i was a intel shareholder. Tick Tock Optimize should tell you something. They are gonna be on 10nm for the next 2-3 years Reply ddriver - Monday, October 03, 2016 - link It tells me that process will not scale down infinitely, ~10 years from now it will hit a brickwall. Reply Morawka - Monday, October 03, 2016 - link I know but my point is, if intel's gonna be on 10nm for 2 years, then GF has plenty of time to get 7nm out, even if it's late, they will be ahead by half a node, even with intel's superior fin pitch. Intel knows this, thats why they are finally willing to fab chips for fabless companies in 10 years when they hit a brick wall, they will simply stack more layers up and up.. Right now, only the base layer is etched at 14nm, 90% of the other layers are etched at a much bigger process to improve yields and provide electron flow. Here is a cross section of a Intel i7: http://imgur.com/a/wXWGX Metal interconnect is the real brick wall, thats why we are seeing material scientist experiment with new materials like Indium gallium arsenide and indium phosphide combined based devices. Silicon will eventually be abandoned in the high end, and down the chain as years go by. Reply ddriver - Tuesday, October 04, 2016 - link I get your point, but that doesn't' change the fact glofo are slow and their process quality is inferior, or in short - IBM or not, they are far from excelling at what they do. Thus getting ahead of themselves has a huge potential to backfire. Johnny boy has problems passing 9-th grade, he is being held for e year or two behind his mates. How smart it is for Johnny boy to "make up" for it by skipping ahead to the 12-th grade exam when he struggles to complete the 10-th? 12-th grade example is harder than 10-th grade. The most likely scenario is they will manage to pull something off, but as usual - delay it, and when it is finally out, it may perform worse than intel and samsung 10 nm and with lower density. And when they finally make chips on it, analysis will reveal that "your nm ain't the same as my nm", or, that it was just a PR number and it is in reality a decorated 10 nm process. Reply witeken - Wednesday, October 05, 2016 - link No, the interconnect has nothing to do with it. I don't think you understand what the interconnect is for. The interconnect simply transports the data, so only the interconnect layers just above the transistor need to be small. InGaAs is researched as a channel material, which is part of the transistor, not the interconnect.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Apple’s expected to launch new MacBook models later this month, and the company might have a refreshed iMac up its sleeve too. Over the weekend, an upgraded 27-inch iMac sporting Intel’s seventh-generation “Kaby Lake” Core i7 chip was briefly spotted on Best Buy’s website. The iMac was listed as “New!” with the next-gen processor on board. Otherwise, the hardware hasn’t changed much. The computer still packs a Retina 5K display with options for 32GB of RAM and a 2TB Fusion Drive. It’s possible this could just be a mistake by some Best Buy employee or even just a placeholder. However, the timing suggests Apple is really gearing up for a new iMac. Beyond its new processor, the computer is also expected to feature an upgraded graphics chip. Apple’s expected to put a bigger emphasis on the redesigned MacBook Pro, which could feature an OLED touchscreen above the keyboard, a Touch ID sensor and USB-C ports. An upgraded MacBook Air may also add a single USB-C port. Apple still hasn’t confirmed plans for an October event, but invitations may be going out pretty soon.

Image: Phil Daint/Shutterstock The biggest challenge facing the communications world, driven by more and more connected people, devices and bandwidth-sucking apps, will be physics. For the past two centuries, the communications revolution was principally about connecting people; from Morse code and the telegraph along thousands of miles of rail track and across oceans, to voice and data in our hands today. For the foreseeable future, people will be outnumbered by billions of things and will have to jostle with bots and devices on increasingly crowded airwaves and pipes. The oft-quoted definition of cloud – the network is the computer – could never be truer, especially as we hurtle into a world where even fibre networks will have capacity issues and 5G will not be the silver bullet that policy makers and the telecoms industry imagine it to be. ‘Some homes today can get 60Mbps broadband. 15 years ago that was the total bandwidth into the country. Our expectations keep changing’ – RONAN FARRELL The fact of the matter is that networks as we know them have capacity problems. It’s all down to physics. Wireless spectrum as we know it is finite, and even fibre optic cabling is not as efficient as even stock markets or media giants and social networks want it to be. In fintech, for example, a picosecond – one-trillionth of a second – of latency will not cut it, even in today’s data-hungry world. If you’ve lived the last 30 or so years, your lives have been defined by advances in networking. You’ve gone from rotary and push button phones to the smartphone currently in your pocket; from 56k dial-up modems to broadband-enabled Wi-Fi to the invasion of machines into your home, thanks to the internet of things (IoT) revolution. The next 30 or so years will be just as revolutionary. But there is a problem: physics. Will 5G really be the next generation of networks? Nokia CTO and Bell Labs president Marcus Weldon believes we are about to run out of radio space unless we develop a whole new dimension. Image: Connor McKenna Marcus Weldon, CTO of Nokia and president of Bell Labs, outlined this to me two years ago when we met at the venerable Bell Labs R&D hub in New Jersey. He had set a challenge for his R&D teams to boost networks as we know them by 10X in the next few years, just to keep up with people and machines. ‘The final frontier of radio is we need to go to shorter distances for fewer users’ – MARCUS WELDON “We put that number out there (10X) because we actually need 100 times more radio capacity. We say that because it’s an easy round number but in fact, the better statement is we need to build a network that has seemingly infinite capacity.” He added: “We have only one dimension left to do this in and that is down to space. The final frontier of radio is we need to go to shorter distances for fewer users, which means creating small, indoor cells. Otherwise, in terms of wireless, we are going to run out of dimensions again.” It is a race against time and space. Almost three-quarters of the world’s population will be connected to a mobile network by 2020, according to the GSM Association. It calculates that there were 4.7bn unique mobile subscribers worldwide at the end of 2015, which is 63pc of the world’s population. That is some milestone when you consider most people did not own, or could afford to own, a mobile device 30 years ago. Already, regulators are holding up their hands and admitting they didn’t foresee the capacity issues. Recently, in Ireland, the communications regulator ComReg published its radio spectrum management strategy and conceded that when the last strategy was published in 2011, the true impact of the smartphone could not have been foreseen. Back then, 4G license auctions presented windfalls for governments around the world, and former TV spectrum in the 800MHz range was re-farmed to let teenagers today enjoy unbridled access to Instagram, Netflix and Snapchat. But as Ireland’s telecoms regulator Gerry Fahy has pointed out, we will need to prepare for 200pc more wireless capacity in the next two to three years, as further spectrum bands such as 700MHz, 1.4GHz, 2.3GHz and 2.6GHz are released to support demand. This brings us on to the next sacred cow: 5G. Already, marketers at various telecoms and tech companies are salivating at the prospect of new campaigns around 5G. But they are missing a core point: unlike 2G, 3G and 4G before it, which were all about incremental increases in speeds, 5G will not be about speed. Instead, it will be a collection of standards around the management of data and cells. 3G, which is now a 14-year-old technology, still has a shelf life and networks will still be trying to eke value out of 4G for the next decade. But that hasn’t stopped people getting slightly ahead of themselves. The EU is looking for a complete overhaul of the union’s telecoms rules, to include setting a minimum requirement of 100Mbps in every household and a 5G minimum connectivity of urban centres by 2025. Such targets will require massive investment, the EU admitted, putting an estimated cost of €500bn on achieving its targets – an investment that will come largely from private sources. Recently, some of the world’s biggest telecoms and automotive companies agreed to join the 5G Automotive Association, to integrate 5G technology into future connected and autonomous vehicles. The new association includes AUDI, BMW and Daimler from the automotive side; and Ericsson, Huawei, Intel, Nokia and Qualcomm from the telecoms industry. People are imagining 5G will represent a step change in speeds. It won’t. It will be a step change in network intelligence. Huawei’s head of ecosystem development, Aileen Smith. ‘The first advantage of 5G will be increased bandwidth because the network world is running out of bandwidth fast and is striving to find bigger pipes’ – AILEEN SMITH In reality, 5G will be a collection of standards and will incorporate a variety of existing 2G, 3G and 4G signals. It will be combined with other forms of connectivity, including Wi-Fi, and new, emerging IoT networks, including Sigfox and Narrowband-IoT. 5G will need to accommodate a world where instead of base stations being every few miles or even 500 metres apart, there could be clusters of smaller, low-power, low-latency base stations that could be just 50 metres apart. The intelligence will be in the network. Think of it as having the power to optimise your smartphone in favour of your Whatsapp communications today; of setting the priority on your home IoT network to security/safety/priority when the Super Bowl is on; to tune all devices to get you the best bandwidth and quality for video. The intelligent network switching power of 5G could also represent a chance for telecoms companies to wrest back the control taken by over the air (OTT) players like Facebook and WhatsApp, who have decimated SMS as a revenue path for telcos. Facebook is already crowing about the death of the phone number. “The service providers are working through a transition from being hardware centric to virtualising their networks and hardware is starting to become a commodity,” said Huawei’s head of ecosystem development, Aileen Smith. According to Smith, the promise of 5G will be in the software. “The first advantage of 5G will be increased bandwidth because the network world is running out of bandwidth fast and is striving to find bigger pipes. “Another critical promise of 5G will be less latency. If you have 5G networks with lower latency and you have self-driving, autonomous vehicles travelling at high speed, then low-latency becomes very important, especially if it is the network telling the car to brake.” A light bulb moment that could change everything In universities across the world, researchers and scientists are working hard to overcome the physics challenge and deliver network innovations that most humans could not even imagine. Companies like Apple and Google are understood to be taking an active interest in a technology called Li-Fi, which uses LED light bulbs to pulse and transmit data at 100 times the speed of Wi-Fi. ‘If you think of today’s networks as a road with one lane, imagine how much data would flow if it was expanded into a highway with 1,000 lanes’ – HARALD HAAS Li-Fi could be a potential solution to the struggle Wi-Fi is going to have in transporting its share of the 35 quintillion bytes of information each month that will be in the world by 2019, according to the World Economic Forum. One of the pioneers of Li-Fi is Harald Haas, who originated the technology in 2011. He currently holds the chair of mobile communications at the University of Edinburgh and is co-founder and chief scientific officer of PureLiFi Ltd, as well as the director of the LiFi Research and Development Centre at the University of Edinburgh. Speaking with Siliconrepublic.com, Haas explained: “Essentially, we are using LED light bulbs to transmit data wirelessly to a mobile handset at very high speeds. “We have shown 10Gbps and we have also shown in the lab that in the near future we can scale it up to 100Gbps.” Haas, traditionally a radio engineer, surprised colleagues 13 years ago when he started focusing at another dimension of the electromagnetic spectrum: light. “Unlike radio, which is limited between zero and 300Ghz, the visible light spectrum can go up to 300 THz, which is 1,000 times more bandwidth compared to the radio spectrum. “If you think of today’s networks as a road with one lane, imagine how much data would flow if it was expanded into a highway with 1,000 lanes.” The idea behind Li-Fi is that LED light bulbs will intelligently transmit data to phones with the right sensors, even in low light. As people move from room to room, Li-Fi-enabled LED bulbs would send the data after them. Cars equipped with Li-Fi LED bulbs, for example, could transmit spatial and diagnostic data as they pass each other on the road. While what Haas is proposing sounds like something out of a science fiction movie, the idea is gaining ground. In July this year, his company PureLiFi raised over £7m in Series B funding from Singapore’s state-owned investment firm, Temasek. Not only that, but the new 3,500 square metre Sogeprom office – located in the commercial La Défense area of Paris – is set to become the first major workplace in the world using high-bandwidth, bi-directional Li-Fi to provide internet access. It will provide the technology and French manufacturer Lucibel will supply the LED luminaires for the ambitious installation at the headquarters of Sogeprom, the property arm of French bank Société Générale. Haas, who sparked the imagination of the world with a famous TED talk on the potential of Li-Fi in 2011, predicts that it could be could be ubiquitous in the next 10 years. He told Siliconrepublic.com: “It took Wi-Fi 14 or 15 years to become ubiquitous. “If you give us another 10 years, I am pretty sure that Li-Fi will be everywhere, in every home appliance that has an LED light, which will allow every home appliance to connect to the internet. It will enable true IoT because, theoretically, you could have IoT in every lightbulb on every street, every home, every vehicle. Every street lamp could be a 5G access point, even in daytime in direct sunlight.” Fibre will underpin everything about the future of networks UCC graduate and PhD researcher at the Tyndall Institute in Cork, Niamh Kavanagh, is working on hollow glass fibre that will make light travel even faster down fibre networks. Image: Tyndall If Haas’s vision to provide connectivity at speeds that are 1,000 times greater than Wi-Fi today is to become a reality, then the broadband networks underpinning each bulb will have to keep up. Every digital experience we take for granted, from a Whatsapp message to a voice call on your landline, involves fibre. Every bank transaction, every email, involves a pulse of data flitting from your device, flying over the air to base stations, hurtling down fibre pipes, bouncing off servers in data centres, and succeeding in arriving in a nanosecond on the other side of the world, or indeed, the room you are standing in. ‘At present, light travels along fibre at 70pc of full speed, it’s akin to trying to jog through water. But when travelling through hollow air, that speed increases to 99.7pc’ – NIAMH KAVANAGH But fibre isn’t perfect and just like with wireless spectrum, it has physical capacity issues too. In countries like Ireland, we stand on the cusp of the fibre to the home (FTTH) era; this is only the beginning. And while fibre is being heralded as a silver bullet that will future-proof communications for the next century, even that will run into problems. But have no fear, because in Cork at the Tyndall Institute, Niamh Kavanagh, a UCC PhD researcher funded by the Irish Research Council, is one of many researchers focusing on the future of fibre and photonics. This year, Kavanagh gave a talk at FameLab, an international science communications event, as well as the Cheltenham Science Festival on the subject of hollow fibre that will transform speeds over fibre. The thrust of Kavanagh’s argument is that in the future, complex surgeries could be carried out using robots operated by skilled surgeons on the other side of the world. This will require fibre networks of the highest speed quality; any network judder, even for a picosecond, could be life-threatening. “At the moment in optical communications, digital information travels along optical fibres, and the one thing people aren’t aware of is that they are using optical fibre links all the time, even when talking on their smartphone. “Currently, the fibres are made of solid glass that is the thickness of a human hair. The laser of information travels down the fibre bouncing off the wall and we can encode that light with information – similar to Morse code – or we can tune it by sending different wavelengths using different colours. “That is where we are at today and photonics is all about finding different ways to maximise the use of bandwidth using different wavelengths,” she told Siliconrepublic.com. The problem, Kavanagh warns, is that we are reaching the maximum bandwidth capabilities for the fibre we have at the moment. “One solution would be to increase the amount of power we are using to send signals but the danger is [that] that can corrupt the information being transmitted.” At Tyndall, Kavanagh and her colleagues are working on creating new kinds of fibre cables that are hollow rather than solid glass. “This would be structured similar to a drinking straw, where the glass surrounds the hollow core, and that’s where the light travels through the air, rather than through a fog of glass. “This reduced interaction of light with the material means you can send much higher amounts of power too. At present, light travels along fibre at 70pc of full speed, it’s akin to trying to jog through water. “But when travelling through hollow air, that speed increases to 99.7pc. One of the biggest industries interested in this type of fibre is the financial markets, particularly the stock markets of London and New York,” Kavanagh said. Kavanagh agrees with Haas that it is a race against time. “Fibre to the premises is happening and we need to stay a few steps ahead of the demand. The way networks are structured at the moment, they don’t scale upwards very easily. We have groups here at Tyndall who are looking five to 10 years down the line and are designing the network architectures and infrastructure to be simpler and more upwardly scalable so we continue to expand into the future. “Technologies like Li-Fi can have such amazing benefits, but at the end of the day the data still needs to go through the fibre optic link so the battle is staying a few steps ahead,” said Kavanagh. Her vision of fibre being core to telesurgery of the future is already a reality. “They did a surgical operation between France and America in 2001 called Operation Lindbergh. There are surgeons in Canada and the US who regularly operate over distances of 400km. Robotic surgeons are becoming more and more commonplace and at Cork University Maternity Hospital, for example, we have a robot called Da Vinci that is used for gynaecological operations with the surgeon just a few metres away. But if we want to make robotic surgery a reality across our planet, low latency fibre is the key.” The wireless world beckons Dr Ronan Farrell, head of RadioSpace and the SFI CONNECT Centre at Maynooth University. He believes 5G will not arrive as fast or as easily as people think. Because fibre will underpin everything that is transmitted (even wirelessly) to the human eye in the coming years, the days of messing with cables to connect devices like TVs and computers to networks will come to an end. This is already happening thanks to Wi-Fi and 4G but it is going to become even more profound. New spectrum ranges will be unlocked to accommodate 5G-related technologies, and a mysterious new wireless technology called E-band, a former NATO radio spectrum between 71GHz and 95GHz. ‘If you really want to get to a point where 1Gbps to the phone is the reality or the reality between TVs, computers and other systems, then that technology is going to be E-band’ – DR RONAN FARRELL “5G is mainly a branding term and it is going to have five physical challenges,” explained Dr Ronan Farrell from the SFI CONNECT Centre based at Maynooth University. “The first challenge is latency, then there is throughput, connectivity, mobility and density. “Latency is the term for when you ask for data and how fast you can get it back. At the moment, it is in the tens or hundreds of milliseconds range, which is faster than you or I can observe from a human perception perspective. But you will need data to travel much, much faster if we are talking about self-driving cars. If artificial intelligence in the cloud is going to be in our lives, then you will need extremely low latency links. “None of the existing telecoms systems will do that. If you really want to get to a point where 1Gbps to the phone is the reality or the reality between TVs, computers and other systems, then that technology is going to be E-band.” As part of the CONNECT national research centre for telecommunications, Maynooth University is to be the site of a new national radio test facility with aims of developing devices for 5G connectivity and the IoT. The centre, to be known as RadioSpace, will provide a large-scale, interference-free facility that will allow scientists and engineers from industry and universities to develop new 5G communications technology. Farrell, who is leading RadioSpace, said that 5G could be further off than people believe. “It is very far from deployment and I believe 4G will play a role for some time. What needs to happen is more and more cells with smaller and more numerous base stations. And who is going to pay for that? “I think it is telling that Google is putting Google Fiber’s expansion on hold because the profit margins aren’t there and the infrastructure is expensive. European telcos are seeing roaming charges being removed and SMS is being killed by WhatsApp. One of the headline claims is that 5G will deliver 1Gbps to your phone, but it could be 10 years before we see the rollout of such networks. “My prediction is that 5G, which will constitute many different technologies and standards, may not happen the same way as 3G and 4G. “What we are seeing instead is an unbelievably rapid advance in E-band technologies, which can deliver 1Gbps to 2Gbps in short range links. This will be critical to the future of self-driving cars because it will enable car radar, for example. Samsung has demonstrated 1Gbps E-band speeds over 100-metre ranges. The mobile operators are taking interest and fibre backhaul will be the key to everything.” In conclusion, Farrell said that research teams at Maynooth University’s RadioSpace are exploring E-band and other ways that the IoT can flourish, even using satellite. He predicted that the future of networks will be a world without wires, where small hospitals and digital homes will have equipment connected using either E-band, 5G or other new wireless standards. Underpinning all of this, he said, will be fibre. “We are entering the fibre to the premises world. We have spent most of our lives carrying mobiles. And now, our homes will be invaded by the IoT. “5G or E-band or whatever comes next will happen in the next 10 years. “But prepare to be surprised. Some homes today can get 60Mbps broadband. 15 years ago that was the total bandwidth into the country. Our expectations keep changing.” In-Depth: Comms Week Related: Fibre, telecoms, wireless, Tyndall National Institute, physics, Wi-Fi, research, funding and investment, radio, government & policy, networks, Maynooth University, higher education Editor John Kennedy is an award-winning technology journalist. editorial@siliconrepublic.com You May Also Like You May Also Like Trending Amazing interactive map with Wi-Fi passwords for world’s airports 8 Oct 201660 Shares Hiring Now Join us to create the technology of tomorrow Be part of a globally successful team A dynamic and rapidly expanding company Keeps files safe, synced and easy to share Comms What are the 10 most valuable telecoms brands on the planet? 7 Oct 2016179 Shares Jobs The 8 hottest jobs in telecoms 7 Oct 201671 Shares SUBSCRIBE TO OUR E-ZINE Sign up to receive weekly alerts bringing the best of Siliconrepublic.com straight to your inbox.

Pokémon Go grew to a massive 45 million daily active users per day after two months in the market, with the market reaching $250 million for the vendor Niantic by September 2016 after two months starting from zero." Phenomenal growth is anticipated to come from implementation of step-by-step procedure virtual reality modules that are used to manage systems. Every business executive in the world wants to have an IT structure agile enough to manage phenomenal growth, should that be necessary, the aim is to construct augmented reality modules that address the issues brought by the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT takes the data from sensors, superimposes analytics on collected data, turns the data into information, and streams alerts back to users that need to take action. Augmented reality enhances our sense of reality, it further explains what is going on around us, it does not support illusion, it supports getting in touch with what is real, what is really out there. Pokemon Go is so much fun because it gives us little animals, little characters to play with in our exact location, it enhances the experience of our neighborhoods. It has large beautiful birds that flap their wings and look magnificent. AR is in the early stages of an explosive growth cycle. The Pokemon Go phenomenon raid adoption raised awareness and expectation for the vision of augmented reality AR and digital enhancement of the surroundings. Digital enhancement as AR is just human explanation of our existing surroundings. Digital enhancement provides human explanations of the innate natural world and of the machines we use to perform work.

(Reuters/Francois Lenoir) Share Written by Joon Ian Wong October 03, 2016 The European Commission has three outstanding antitrust charges against Google. They are far from settled, but documents leaked to Reuters Oct. 1 provide some clarity on how the European Union’s executive arm plans to deal with Google’s alleged abuse of dominance. According to the leaked documents, the commission plans to impose a heavy fine on the search giant at a level “which will be sufficient to ensure deterrence.” Google could be fined a maximum of 10% of its annual global revenue, or as much as $7.5 billion based on its 2015 revenue. The EU’s biggest fine for abuse of a dominant position was levied on Intel in 2009 at $1.44 billion. The biggest antitrust fine ever levied by the EU stands at $3.23 billion and was imposed on Daimler, Volvo, MAN, and others in July for participating in a cartel that was fixing prices. Here’s a quick recap of the EU’s cases against Google: April 2015—Shopping: Google is accused of favoring its own comparison-shopping service in its search results. This set of charges was reinforced in July 2016 after Google had a chance to reply. April 2016—Android: The EU says Google is manipulating handset-makers and telcos by requiring them to agree to exclusive deals to pre-install key Google apps. The company also is accused of paying telcos and handset-makers to pre-install Google Search, and preventing the sale of handsets using non-Google flavors of Android. July 2016—AdSense: Google is accused of preventing publishers who use AdSense from displaying ads from other advertising platforms. The Reuters documents refer to the Android and shopping cases. The documents are called Statements of Objections, which are lists of charges levied by the commission, and they were sent last week to companies that had complained about Google so that the commission could received feedback. Google received these charge sheets when the investigations were made public, on the dates listed above. The commission declined to comment on the Reuters story. The Android charge sheet shows that the commission proposed stopping Google from paying mobile operators and handset makers in return for pre-installing Google Search and Google Play, the official channel for Android users to obtain new apps. Additionally, the commission wants to stop Google’s “anti-fragmentation” agreements, which prevent handset-makers from using non-Google versions of the Android mobile operating system if they want to pre-install the commercially important Google Play on their machines. Google also will not be allowed to “punish or threaten” companies who don’t follow its rules. The charge sheet for comparison-shopping was heavily redacted by Google, a process that the commission allows to prevent confidential information from being seen by complainants. The commission intends to ask Google to rank search results from Google Shopping the same way it treats results from competing services, the document said. The commission said it would rule in the future on whether Google could ask competing services to pay for more prominent placement. The charge sheets aren’t the commission’s definitive plans. Based on Google’s defense, which can include requesting a hearing with an independent arbiter—as Qualcomm, facing a fine of up to $2.5 billion is doing—the EC could modify or drop charges. The next step is for the commission to create a draft decision, which will set out concrete actions it wants Google to take, and the size of a fine, if any. After that, Google could still appeal, as Intel is doing. In other words, there’s a long road ahead in the battle between Google and the EU.

Linux 4.9's CPUFreq To Make Greater Use Of Scheduler Info, IOWait Boosting Written by Michael Larabel in Hardware on 3 October 2016 at 06:34 AM EDT. Add A Comment The past few kernel releases there's been a redesign of CPUFreq and P-State code for being able to make use of the kernel's scheduler utilization data by these CPU frequency scaling drivers. That work also led to the introduction of the Schedutil governor. Work along this line has continued for Linux 4.9. Rafael Wysocki sent in the ACPI and power management pull requests on Sunday night for the Linux 4.9 kernel. With the power management updates, the CPUFreq driver was changed to allow the scheduler to pass hints to the governors' utilization update callbacks. This latest work adds support for IOwait boosting to the Schedutil governor and the Intel P-Sstate driver for boosting the performance if the enqueued task was previously waiting on I/O. The power management pull request also has some fixes around the Schedutil code, support for more ARM platforms in CPUFreq-DT, and a variety of other updates. The ACPI update has ACPICA code updates, a new ACPI WDAT (Watchdog Action Table) driver, and other ACPI updates and fixes. Details on that here.

When it was first announced, it was revealed that the game would not be sold separately. However later it was speculated based on comments that maybe Modern Warfare Remastered could be sold separately after all. If you were hoping that would be the case, you might be disappointed. According to a post on Charlie Intel, they have noted the fine print on Call of Duty’s website that states that not only will you need Infinite Warfare to play the game, but you will actually need to have the disc inserted in order to play the game, presumably as some kind of verification/authentication tool. The fine print reads, “Modern Warfare Remastered is a full game download (game disc must be inserted to play Modern Warfare Remastered).” Now for those who were planning on buying Infinite Warfare anyway, we guess this doesn’t really change anything. However for those who are only interested in Modern Warfare, there does not appear to be any other way to acquire the game for now. The folks at Polygon have reached out to Activision to clarify the fine print, but until the publisher states otherwise, like we said, gamers have only one way of acquiring the remastered copy of Modern Warfare for now.

I have fond memories of hosting him here in Atlanta a few years ago. He got separated from his luggage on the flight, but had his sax as carry-on and a laptop. We had to stop to do some clothes shopping before his talk. The gig went very well, except he just did one short sax number. I had been able to stitch together some of the Christian Palestinian movement, the peace loving Quakers, and Cynthia McKinney even showed up. The best part was being able to bring my TV camera and be able to set up close enough to pick up his audio with a shotgun mic, so I have some great archive footage. Gilad is a great stand up comic, with good timing and schmoozing an audience. They loved every minute of it. We are passing this along even at this late date, just in case some VT readers could make one of the gigs.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Oct 2, 2016 at 3:11PM Many growth investors like tech stocks because they occasionally generate market-crushing gains within just a few years. Over the past decade, e-commerce giant Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)rallied nearly 2,500%, while Baidu -- the biggest search engine in China -- surged nearly 2,000%. Image source: Pixabay. Those gains look explosive, but many other tech stocks also bombed during those 10 years. Therefore, investors who are interested in this sector should remember five simple tips before buying their first tech stocks. 1. Understand what the company does The tech sector is filled with companies that promote "hot" technologies. However, investors often buy shares of these companies on an analyst recommendation without really understanding what they sell. As Warren Buffett famously said, "Never invest in a business you cannot understand." That's why Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is such a popular tech stock among both mainstream and institutional investors. Its business is easy to understand -- most of its revenue comes from its three hardware product lines (iPhone, iPad, Mac), but it's gradually pivoting toward paid services (Apple Pay, Apple Music, Apple Care) to reduce its dependence on hardware. Other companies have hidden strengths. Amazon is generally known as an e-commerce site, but its most profitable business is actually AWS (Amazon Web Services), the largest cloud platform in the world. The profits from that business offset the much lower margins at its marketplace business. 2. Look for market leaders When I invest in tech stocks, I generally look for "best-in-breed" market leaders. These leaders usually have strong pricing power, stable margins, and the ability to exploit economies of scale and bundling strategies to marginalize smaller rivals. Amazon exhibits all these qualities in both the e-commerce and cloud markets. Cisco has the same strengths in the networking equipment market, while Salesforce has similar advantages in the cloud-based customer relationship management market. 3. Always look forward The worst mistake a tech company can make is falling behind the tech curve. Yet larger tech companies often fall behind because they focus more on quarterly growth, dividends, or buybacks than boosting their research and development budgets. Market leaders, their egos boosted by temporary glory, also sometimes prematurely dismiss disruptive threats. Image source: Pixabay. That's precisely what happened to BlackBerry (NASDAQ:BBRY), which controlled a fifth of the smartphone market seven years ago. After its market share plunged to nearly 0%, it decided to stop producing its own smartphones in late September. The same can be said about Intel, which surrendered the mobile chip market to Softbank's ARM Holdings' licensees, and Microsoft, which ceded the mobile OS market to Apple and Alphabet's Google. If a tech company stops innovating and simply follows market trends, its high growth days might be over. That's what might be happening with Apple, which is pursuing "hot" markets like smartwatches and streaming music instead of launching new game-changing devices like the iPod and iPhone. 4. Understand the valuations Investors often pay big premiums for high-growth tech stocks, but these stocks can be solid investments if their valuations are supported by comparable earnings growth. Amazon, for example, trades at 79 times forward earnings, but is expected to deliver earnings growth of 80% next year.  However, these valuations can be tricky if a company posts explosive sales growth with widening losses. In these cases, investors should check the company's cash position and free cash flow to better analyze the health of the business. 5. Don't ignore "old tech" Many investors focus on the sexy high-growth tech stocks, but they should remember that slow growers like Cisco, Microsoft, Intel, and IBM are still great sources of stable income. These companies also buy back lots of stock, regularly raise their dividends, and trade at much lower multiples than higher-flying tech darlings -- making them ideal core holdings for your portfolio. The key takeaway The tech sector might seem overwhelming at first, but it all comes down to buying what you understand, identifying the market leaders and disruptors, and understanding their valuations. Investors who tick off these boxes while doing their due diligence might find some solid tech stocks to hold for the long run.

By Hadlee Simons on 29 September, 2016 It’s tough to find decent Windows laptop/tablet hybrids at the sub-R5000 price point, but TCL’s new Alcatel device might just pack the goods. At a suggested price of R3559, you get a budget-minded Intel Cherry Trail X5 processor (T3 Z8350), 2GB of RAM, 10.1-inch 1280×800 display, dual front speakers and 32GB of expandable storage. In the camera department, we’ve got a 5MP main camera and a 2MP shooter with flash for video calling and selfies. However, TCL has also spiced things up with the addition of a keyboard dock, featuring an extra 2580mAh battery over and above the tablet’s 5830mAh pack. The keyboard dock comes equipped with LTE hotspot capabilities and USB/microUSB/microHDMI ports. The Alcatel Plus 10 offers a decent experience for the price – at least on paper Looking to get your hands on this device? There’s only one outlet stocking them at the moment. “The Alcatel Plus 10, 2-in-1 LTE device is available in silver from Vodacom at the recommended retail price of R3559.00. Alcatel Plus 10 is also available with a free 1 Year Office 365 licence for R329 pm x 36 on 5GB Data Price Plan or R429 pm x 36 on 10GB Data Price Plan,” the company wrote in a press statement. In other words, it won’t hold a candle to high-end convertibles from the likes of Asus and Lenovo. But it’s not supposed to. The Plus 10 is aimed squarely at the sub-R5000 market, going toe-to-toe against the likes of the Nextbook range and other cheap hybrid devices.

Exports are serious business for many Arizona companies, including Honeywell. (Photo: John Samora/ The Republic) There’s a threat to our economic growth and we should all be concerned. Arizona’s business leaders already are. Presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are both bashing the international trade agreements critical to supporting continued economic growth of Arizona and America. Many of those pacts such the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Mexico and Canada have been successfully in place for years. Trade means Arizona jobs and money Trump has said an overhaul of the nation’s global agreements is needed to boost economic and jobs growth. That could come as a surprise to at least 93,354 Arizonans — the number of jobs supported by Arizona exports in 2014 — and others in the state whose salaries are supplemented by those directly involved in exporting. Exports are critical to our economy. 95 percent of the market for U.S. goods and services are outside the United States. When it comes to sales for the technology industry, international markets are No. 1. For Arizona, exports totaled $22.6 billion in 2015, according to the International Trade Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce. The largest category was computer and electronic products, accounting for $5.6 billion. In addition, electrical equipment, appliances and components contributed $1.7 billion to the total.  How trade deals help business FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedIn Top 10 Phoenix-area exports  Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. Phoenix-area businesses exported $20.6 billion worth of goods and services to foreign countries in 2012. Sounds like a lot, but it's about half what we should be doing. So, what are we selling that other countries are buying?  Charlie Leight/The Republic Fullscreen NO. 1: Aerospace remains a top industry for Phoenix, and this is why. The Valley exported $2.7 billion in aircraft products and parts in 2012.  David Kadlubowski/The Republic Fullscreen NO. 2: Semiconductors are a core market for the Valley - and a growing one. Semiconductors saw $597 million in export gains from 2009-12.  File photo Fullscreen NO. 3: Precision instruments brought in $1.4 billion in exports in 2012. according to Export Nation, a report from Brookings' Global Cities Initiative.  Tom Tingle/The Republic Fullscreen NO. 4: The Valley's banking and investing industry sent $1.1 billion worth of services overseas in 2012.  The Republic Fullscreen NO. 5: Another aerospace industry boon - Phoenix exported $786 million in air transportation services in 2012.  Tom Tingle Tom Tingle/The Republic Fullscreen NO. 6: Computer and electronic royalties pay out big bucks for the Valley.

Nonferrous metal products - primarily those made from copper - totaled $536 million in 2012.  Michael Schennum/The Republic Fullscreen NO. 9: Foreign countries don't even need processed metals from us.

Having these deals in place has been crucial to resolving the kinds of issues that can arise in international trade, such as over intellectual property and data rights. The concern by Clinton and Trump over existing agreements also carries over to international trade pacts under consideration. The Arizona Technology Council has taken a position on most of those pending agreements. We feel the best way to keep U.S. businesses competitive is to ensure they have access to markets in developed countries and the world’s fastest growing economies. MORE: Where Trump, Clinton stand on trade, other issues Trade deals can prevent protectionist non-tariff barriers that threaten market access for U.S. companies. Free trade agreements can especially provide commercial commitments and protections to our nation’s technology industry. Sharing these beliefs is the Arizona District Export Council comprised of international trade experts from across the state appointed by the U.S. Secretary of Commerce. I sit on its Trade Policy & Legislative Affairs Committee. A related issue is the future of the Export-Import Bank. Trump has indicated he would shut down Ex-Im while Clinton fortunately understands its role in supporting U.S. global competitiveness. The Council had been strong supporters of Ex-Im’s reauthorization. While that came to fruition, a lot of it still hasn’t been implemented, so that has been caught up in the trade debate. Almost 9,000 companies, including almost 6,000 small businesses, have used the bank to finance export sales since 2007. Considering the value of U.S. exports, Ex-Im’s role in trade has proven to be crucial. Careful about blaming international trade When you trace the roots of the debate over trade, you can’t help but consider it to be populist. We live in a time when people who aren’t involved in international trade are unhappy about their place in the world and they want to find blame. It’s always easy to point the finger at big companies, big government or even other countries as sources of the problems that we have. MY TURN: Grow trade with Mexico now (or regret it later) But if you look at the facts — which people don’t do when it’s an ideology at work or there is unnecessary zeal associated with it — the existing trade agreements have done well for Arizona and the United States. Had it not been for these pacts, a lot of the issues that are critical to sort out in trade would be left to chance. Remember, something businesses hate more than just about anything is uncertainty, particularly when dealing in other countries. Isolationism shrinks new markets Skip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is urging Congress to adopt a landmark 12-nation Asia-Pacific trade deal, the Trans Pacific Partnership, arguing that rejection would badly damage U.S. credibility and national security. (Sept. 28) AP The pending agreements provide templates for even more productive trade. Getting the most attention is the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which would open opportunities in Asia, the most important market in the world today. Clinton has said she would oppose trade agreements like TPP unless they create good-paying American jobs and boost incomes. TPP holds that promise. EDITORIAL: Arizona Dems can't afford to fight trade deal MORE: Arizona bucks U.S. trend, boosts trade in 2015 A lot of the tech sector has moved to the Pacific Rim and many multinational companies based in the United States do business in these other countries. Having the terms of an agreement sorted out by our government that protects, for example, intellectual property establishes the protocol for successfully trading with another country. The ground rules are established for fair and equitable trade between countries, helping further increase the economic benefits for the U.S. Still, Trump has labeled TPP as “horrible.” Is his choice isolationism, which this country goes through from time to time? History tells us that has never been good for our nation. Trump and Clinton lag on trade Skip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump tangled Monday night over trade, taxes and how to bring good-paying jobs back to the United States as they opened their first face-to-face presidential debate. (Sept. 26) AP It's no secret that Republicans traditionally have supported free trade and its related agreements while Democrats have not because their concern has been such deals end up sending U.S. jobs to other countries. This time, both candidates have indicated they would penalize manufacturers that move production abroad. For companies that leave the country to lower their tax burdens, Clinton has called for each to pay an “exit tax.”  For those benefiting from “Make It in America” incentives, she would make them pledge not to move jobs offshore. She and Trump are way behind the times since the real trend is actually favorable for the United States. The fact is, companies are moving back here. More IT and manufacturing jobs are returning than has been witnessed in a very long time because the cost of living is increasing in other nations as their middle-class segments are growing. The financial benefit that these other places once had related to labor is no longer overcoming the added costs of shipping goods around the world. The candidates also have expressed their desire to renegotiate parts of NAFTA. In fact, Trump has said he would withdraw from the accord altogether if he is not satisfied with negotiations. ROBB: Does Trump want smart trade or no trade? VIEWPOINTS: Canada's lucrative ties with Arizona A change in NAFTA would be crippling to Arizona. Exports from Arizona to those countries with free trade agreements with the U.S. increased 67 percent since 2005, with the top trading partners being Mexico, Canada, South Korea, Israel, Australia, and Chile.We’re huge beneficiaries of NAFTA because of our proximity as a border state where trade comes through our port. The U,S. should continue to honor NAFTA and the other agreements that are working well. And we need to get TPP and other pending agreements executed so that businesses can get on with enhancing international trade. Clinton and Trump need to listen to those actually involved in exporting to learn the true merits these pacts offer. Just at a time when trade relationships are reaching potential, putting on the brakes makes absolutely no sense. My fellow members of the Arizona District Export Council join me in asking you not to wait until election day to be heard. Contact representatives of the candidates now and let them know we should stay the course when it comes to opportunities for expanding international free trade. Arizona cannot afford to sit on the sidelines and watch prosperity pass us by. Steven G. Zylstra is president & CEO of the Arizona Technology Council. 26 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDIN 6 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://azc.cc/2dQhmPr TOP VIDEOS Zoo's gorilla barrier didn't meet standards when Harambe died 0:47 People formed a human ladder to rescue an man from a river in China 0:36 Marilyn Monroe's iconic dress sell for $4.8 million 1:05 Twitter expected to field offers to buy social media network this week 1:32 Black police group unhappy with political endorsements 0:32 Emu loose on I-10 in Arizona 0:12 First look: Sky Harbor Terminal 3 upgrades 1:23 Halloween 2016 By The Numbers 0:50 Octopus hunts one of the world's most venomous fish 0:35 Kent Somers, Bob McManaman discuss news from Cardinals camp on Friday 2:12 You Can Sleep In Dracula's Coffin Thanks To Airbnb 1:09 Five things that matter to Millennials in the election 1:52 Half-zebra, half-donkey is 100% adorable 0:27 Punchlines: Disenchanted yet? 4:54 Mexico City cartoon exhibit depicts Donald Trump as a Nazi 2:04 Former Jets player killed in crash 0:37 Glenn Beck praises Michelle Obama's speech as incredibly effective 1:15 4 dead when truck plunged off San Diego bridge into crowd below 0:43 What to watch for in Sprint Cup race at Kansas Speedway 1:56 Several women say Trump inappropriately touched them 0:50 Energy-saving tips 1:45 Sustainable building at ASU 2:10 Sedona house destroyed 1:36 Dad's heartfelt Facebook post inspires flood of support from strangers 0:54 Teen Marine surprises his mom after six months away 0:37 Accused school shooter charged with murder, attempted murder 4:29 A Phoenix resident is suing a Pappadeaux restaurant 0:49 Pottermore will tell you what your Patronus is 0:41 5 most memorable Ryder Cup moments 1:11 Trump campaign touts donation windfall after the debate 1:08 This beer is supposed to taste like a burger 1:02 The Republic editorial board's 2016 presidential endorsement 1:07 Pepe the Frog declared a hate symbol by Anti-Defamation League 0:30 More Stories Red table, blue table: Talking turkey at post-election Thanksgiving dinner Nov. 18, 2016, 9:45 a.m. Montini: Is Arpaio off the hook?

You can read some of the highlights from their discussion at that link, or listen to it in the audio player above. Below, we’ve posted a lightly edited complete transcript of their conversation. If you like this, be sure to subscribe to Recode Decode on iTunes, Google Play Music, TuneIn and Stitcher. Transcript by Celia Fogel. Kara Swisher: Today in the red chair is someone I've tried to get here for a long time, it's someone I've known for a very long time: Bill Gurley, general partner at the venture capital firm Benchmark. He's invested in companies ranging from GrubHub to Zillow to Uber and serves on several board[s] of directors. Before he joined Benchmark in 1999, Bill worked at Compaq and spent four years as a tech analyst on Wall Street. Bill, welcome to the show. Bill Gurley: Thanks for having me. We have known each other a long time. Very long time. I knew you as an analyst, I think. Yes. I don't know if I knew you at Compaq, because I didn't cover Compaq. But I did cover, I remember, the CEO at the time. There's so much to talk about; I think people know you really well here in Silicon Valley, but some of our listeners don't. So walk through how you got to Benchmark. I wrote the story when you went to Benchmark, if you recall, in 1999 for the Wall Street Journal. You had been at another venture capital firm. How far back do you want me to go? Well, how did you get into [being a] tech analyst? Let's start with tech analyst and Compaq. I had a computer engineering degree in undergrad, and my sister was a double E [electrical engineering major] out of Rice and was employee 63 at Compaq, so I was exposed … Wow. Where did you grow up? In Houston. So yeah, of course. My father was in the space program, worked at Johnson Space Center. And Compaq was there, right? In Texas. Yeah, and her going through that obviously brought a lot of exposure into our family of being at a startup, and she was given options. And Kleiner was an investor. Oh yeah. I wouldn't have expected to have that exposure that early in my life. I also — like everyone you've probably had in this chair — had a Commodore VIC-20 and used to code out of magazines and stuff like that. I ended up at the University of Florida where I rode the end of the bench on the basketball team and got a comp sci degree. I went to Compaq, where I'd spent some summers, and worked there for a couple of years, and I found I was drawn to a broader calling. I started work on the third PC and it looked a lot like the second and the first. What did you do? I worked in a team that did problem solving. So when a new computer was coming to market, they'd put it into test and it would fail. And my team, we'd get thrown in a room with a logic analyzer — Like, "why isn't this working?" Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it was fun. It was fun. This was the '80s, right? Yeah, this was '89 to '91. I remember AOL was on that one computer ... I can't remember. They were all small computers. I had a Prodigy account when I was working there, and I used to trade stocks. I ended up going to business school and then I started trading stocks — Borland went public during that time. And so this combination of being fascinated with technology, looking for a broader thing to do, and then getting interested in investing and tech and disruption, that kind of thing. So I went to business school, I thought about trying to get into venture at business school. I went and met with some Austin Ventures people who said, "Kid, you're way too young, go get 20 years of work experience." Right, because they had operators. That's what they said, yeah. Which is ironic, and I can come back to that, based on how we choose people at Benchmark now. But anyway, while I was at business school, everybody cracks open every Fortune and Businessweek and they read everything because they want to think they are professional business people. And so I was reading about all these amazing analysts at Goldman Sachs at the time, Dan Benton and people like that. And Rick Sherlund. And they were always quoted, like, opining, and I just got interested in it. You wanted to opine. Yeah, I went to Wall Street and just knocked on doors. Like cold, like what you read about. And got very lucky that [Credit Suisse] First Boston gave me an opportunity. Right, which was a big deal at the time. And then two weeks after I joined, Charlie Wolf was there covering PCs, and he announced he wanted to resign and back off. So I went into my tiny little apartment with no air conditioner and wrote a 20-page assessment of the PC industry. What did you tap away on? I don't remember, probably some kind of luggable. I'm thinking Kaypro, perhaps, around then. Trash-80. And I went in and begged for Charlie's job, and was very fortunate. Not only did Charlie share with me all his models, but two of the other ranked analysts, David Course and Dan Benton, who still comes to your conference every year, they gave me all their models and they've all left the field. Oh, where did they go? Dan and David when to the buy side and Charlie went into academia. They just like got out. "We're leaving." Wasn't that a signal to you? "Uh oh, I better get out of here?" It couldn't have been more fortunate, right? Because I moved up through the ranks very quickly. It's an opportunity. That's somewhat how I got my job at the Washington Post. People retired or left. So that was a big event. And then the other big event was at Stewart Alsop's conference, which Charlie helped me get into. Which was the big deal, Agenda. Oh man, you're standing at that first dinner, and there's Bill Gates and Larry Ellison and all this stuff, and you're like, "I'm just a nobody, this is crazy." But anyway, one of those first few years, they were selling a Palm Pilot. And it had the attendees’ contact information in it. Ahh, aren't you clever. And I had just started this newsletter called "Above the Crowd," which was a fax at the time. And so I was just like, "Oh wait, this is too easy." So I paid like $200 for this Palm Pilot and I spammed everybody … … with "Above the Crowd." It was a great newsletter. The most important people in the technology industry. Yeah, you've always been a writer. We'll talk about that soon. It came from the analyst days, because I had to write big, long reports. Absolutely. But they used to write reports a lot better then. There was a lot of people, you know, Mary, you, even Henry Blodget wrote some fantastic stuff, though it didn't end so well for him there. So then — I should hurry this along — so after three years of doing that, I was getting burned out. It's a tough job being an analyst. And I was thinking about going to the buy side and, in fact, had been interviewing with Capital Group in LA ... Right, that's Gordon Crawford. ... who I still have a ton of respect for. And Frank Quattrone called me ... out of the blue, and he had left Morgan Stanley on, I think, Good Friday in '96. We ended up sitting down and he said that he'd like me to join their new firm. And I said, "You know, I'm kind of burned out on this analyst thing." And he said, "Well, what do you want to do, long-term?" And I said, "I'd love to be a venture capitalist." And Frank said, "Why don't I move you to Silicon Valley? You can cover any sector you want, and I'll introduce you to every venture capitalist I know." Well, that's an offer. Yeah. What did he do, take your soul? [BG laughs] Frank kind of looks satanic, so did he say, "You must ..." You know, there are people that are super loyal to Frank and I'm one of them. And when someone makes a commitment like that and helps you get your dream job … And you worked for them. Yeah, I did. And we were very fortunate. We were lead-left on the Amazon IPO, which would be a famous trivia question one day. "Who took Amazon public?" Frank was in the middle of all this. Or else buying and selling companies. He was involved in a lot of that during that time. Yes, and [Jeff] Blackburn was the banker that worked alongside me who then went to Amazon. Before we get ahead of ourselves, what was that period like? Because I was here too. I remember these things. And at the risk of sounding aged, it really was an exciting time. Well, for me, it was my real first exposure to Silicon Valley. I'd been out here a couple times as a PC analyst, but the PC industry wasn't really centered in Silicon Valley. No, it wasn't. IBM and Compaq, and even AST was in Irvine. And Gateway was in Sioux Falls. So I didn't travel here all that much, and then I was just suddenly put here. Because internet, that's why. And by the way, that's the sector that I asked Frank that I wanted to cover, and of course I knew nothing about it, so I went and bought all those TCP/IP books and stuff, which I don't think helped me at all, but I read them anyway. And it was super exciting, you know? And I knew a few people. Like when Frank called me, I called [Roger] McNamee because he had been at T. Rowe, so he was someone I had known from the buy side. And there's a few others like Glen Kacher and some of the Tiger guys. So I called Roger and I said, "I don't know Frank." He's like, "Take his meeting immediately. You have to. This'll get you to Silicon Valley." So it's been great. Roger's always been someone that I've called along the years to help me think through decisions. Yeah, it was so exciting. Like I remember one of the first meetings was in a train caboose for CNET with Halsey [Minor] and Shelby [Bonnie]. And I knew nothing about media or advertising. Right. That doesn't stop many people. And Halsey was just remarkably upset that I wasn't getting it faster, and Shelby, God bless him, was just super calm and casual, bringing me along and teaching me. That was interesting. He used to call me in the middle of the night because he was like, "Why is my story on [page] A22 of the Wall Street Journal and Yahoo's on the front?" Or whatever. And I said, "You're lucky you're on A22, because I got you on A22 or else you wouldn't be there at all." But that didn't end well for Halsey. No. But I've stayed in touch with Shelby. I consider him a wonderful gentleman. Yeah. So then you shifted over to venture capital. I was with Hummer Winblad for 18 months and then came to Benchmark. So that was a big deal, I remember. That was like, gaaah. Like, "You left there?" And they were shifting at Benchmark at the time. Yeah, two weeks after I announced the Hummer Winblad position, Andy Rachleff cornered me at a conference and said, "Dude, why didn't you call me?" And quite frankly, I would have to say I was so fixated [on] being a venture capitalist [that] when someone started to ask me, I'd say, "Yes!" Yeah, take the first date. And they were a well-known firm. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I'm still very close friends with John [Hummer]. I think the cultural fit with Benchmark is just [better]. Yeah. I remember tall, white guys, essentially. Well ... Come on. I sat across from them when they were talking about eBay. When someone approaches you that works for an equal partnership … because everyone else that's working their way into venture starts at the bottom with only a piece of the action, you’ve got to work your way up. Someone else's name firm. It's a pretty compelling offer when someone comes and says, "We want you to be one of us." Absolutely. And you were the tallest of all those tall men. But it did cause reverberations. Everyone was sort of talking, I remember, it was a big deal because you were sort of the bright young thing at the time. Well I guess now that I've been here something like 16 or 17 years, it's probably the right place. Yeah. And it was changing also. It was starting to shift. To a certain extent, the beginning of my venture career was a little bit like being near the top of a roller coaster: Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch. And then it just slammed down before I ever had a chance to really establish myself and build a track record. This was the end of the first internet bubble. And when I first arrived at Benchmark, it was like, "Nothing can go wrong." There was an IPO every week. And they had done eBay. And then, wham! Man, the door came down hard. So what was that like? Because you do write a lot about bubbles. You're like the worrywart of Silicon Valley. And we'll talk about that in the next section. But what was that like, as an early venture capitalist, when you have that happen to you? It's intimidating. I mean, I think for anyone that breaks into venture, years two, three and four, unless you're as lucky as, say, [Matt] Cohler with Instagram or Roelof [Botha] with YouTube, are just anxiety-ridden. People use the metaphor of children: You basically have a bunch of middle-aged teenagers with acne that are awkward and clumsy. And you haven't proven anything. That's if you do early-stage. And so it's a gut check. And it's really helpful — at least it was helpful for me at Benchmark with the equal partnership — there's just this kind of team orientation where, if you feel like you're struggling, people are getting beside you. Yeah, because they all have a stake in it. Yeah, they have a stake in you doing well. It's not an eat-what-you-kill kind of situation. Not at all. So what was your investment? My first investment at Hummer Winblad was a company called Employease, which was SaaS HR. Ah, early. Way before its time. It was like Workday, 10 years early. Or Zenefits. I was just visiting their offices. Very similar. Because we didn't charge the same way, but the same customer set. But it was the beginning of that idea. And ADP ended up buying it for 150 [million]. But we didn't make nearly as much money. And we made a huge mistake by choosing HR instead of sales, because HR is a corporate purchase by someone who doesn't have any authority. And sales is a credit card purchase by someone who has all the authority. So, hard lesson. So you did that. And what was your first at Benchmark? What were you involved in? It was Epinions. Epinions, oh my god. Was that a success or a failure for you? We ended up merging it with Dealtime, it went public, and eBay bought it for $600, $700 million. Yeah, so you feel good about that. But that was a hit company, and then sort of not. It was. It was covered in the New York Times Magazine, and then the bubble burst and then there was a founder split and … Explain Epinions for people who don't know. I remember you on the covers. It was always on the covers, that guy. Epinions was a big UGC idea at the beginning of the internet, which was basically to allow UGC reviews of anything and everything. And they started in the categories more like products. They did experiment with services. And the CEO was? The CEO was Naval Ravikant. Naval, yeah. That's right. An interesting story about him: We ended up splitting from him and there ended up being a lawsuit. And this was, I don't know, 16, 17 years ago. I'd always thought of Naval as one of the smartest people I'd ever met, but when someone sues you, you tend to get on the other side of things. And just this past winter, I was at a ski event that Chris Sacca put together, and he was invited and we sat down and talked for the first time in [ages]. Oh wow. And? It was great. Hugged it out? Yeah, it was awesome. It reminded me of why we worked together in the first place. But I regret that we spent 16 years not chatting. And he's obviously gone on to do some spectacular things. In the next section, we're going to talk a little bit about your philosophies, what you write about, because you write about bubbles and things like that. But what was your philosophy on investing then? What were you doing in the early days? And we'll talk later about how it changed. I think when I was on Wall Street. just devouring any book I could in investing philosophy — I think I bring a structured approach. You're almost academic in the way you think about it. And the way I think about it, which will sound trite, but I'm always looking for some kind of competitive advantage, like some type of unfair ability to compete in the marketplace. I don't get drawn to the kind of enterprise deals that are just, "Who has the better Salesforce, knock them down," kind of thing. People make money doing that. It's a valid approach. I remember the OpenTable scenario. We're meeting with Chuck [Templeton], and he's in, like, three restaurants, and we're like, "How could this ever work?" And you're like, "Well, it can work if we tip it into a network effect and then everyone has to buy it." And that's what played out. It's that kind of thing. So is that what convinced you? Like, what advantage do you mean? In that case, we were betting on the existence of a network effect. And people talk about network effects all the time, but you come up with ways to try and analyze whether it's possible or not. Will more diners lead to more restaurants, and will more restaurants lead to more diners? Are there ways to measure and study that? Or to implement the go-to-market strategy such that it exploits it as much as possible? So does your analytical approach hurt you sometimes? You're not the gut investor that some people are. It can. I think venture's really hard. And there's a lot of luck involved. And mistakes that you make — especially missing ideas — are ... it's called asymmetric returns. But if you invest in something that doesn't work, you lose one times your money. If you miss Google, you lose 10,000 times your money. You have to orient yourself toward — Bruce [Dunlevie] uses the phrase, "What could go right?" And you have to kind of think that way all the time. Oh, that's interesting. And you're more likely, being overly analytical, to talk yourself out of things. Right, right, that's what I mean. And so you have to twist your brain in the right way. Yeah, because you can think of all the wrong things, "What could go wrong?" Yeah. And by the way, the Google example is one that kind of fit that at the time. That was 1998, yeah. Excite was going bankrupt. Yup, they were. And Yahoo's stock had fallen from like 82 to 10. So search didn't look that interesting. And you had two academics and ... There's a venture rule book: "Don't back academics who insist on being CEO." [laughs] So there was a number of things that said, "Don't do it." But two of the smartest investors ever — … Sequoia and Mike Barnes ... — stepped up and did it. They also wanted a price that was seemingly ridiculous, obviously a very good investment. Did you pass on that one? We failed to pursue it. It's always important to state it that way. Because to say "pass" made it sound like we had a chance. I don't know if we had a chance. They presented to us and we failed to pursue it. And if we had, we would have had to compete with two of the best. Right. Absolutely, I remember visiting that garage, Susan Wojcicki's garage at the time. There were 25 employees when I met with them. And they were crazy, let's be clear. They were. And there were a lot of search things that had gone wrong. And Yahoo still was very strong. And, in fact, their big break was when they put Google on the Yahoo platform as the search engine. I remember. And it was a fatal error for Yahoo at the time, even though they got a big stake in it. Yup. So all right, when we get back we're going to talk about how you've developed as a venture capitalist and also some of your writings. Because you always create sort of a big old mess. Like, people start talking about the things you write, especially around bubbles. Recently you've been writing about bubbles, and you've written about them several times. You're sort of the voice of warning in the industry. When we get back with Bill Gurley of Benchmark. [ad] We're here with Bill Gurley of Benchmark, who I've known a long time. We're talking about investing, philosophy and writing about it. Now, you've been very public about your opinions. A lot of venture capitalists are super secretive. You haven't been. You were an analyst before, so you're used to writing and putting your opinions out there, and at various times you've caused sort of a kerfuffle talking about the bubble, right? At the top, where everyone's feeling good, you're like, "Just a second." Sort of like the aunt at a garden party sometimes, talking about how you had written about the trouble a-comin’. This was about six months ago? Yup. I would tell you — as a backdrop, and then I'll dive into it — that I have a philosophy that the very best entrepreneurs are disserved by bubbles. In other words, they would raise money at any time. When bubbles come along, almost anyone can raise money. And so it creates excessive competition, you get companies that are misbehaving and doing things that can disrupt markets. And so I've found, and maybe I'm just a contrarian, but I've found that like 1999 and 2015 were two of my least favorite times in Silicon Valley. Some of it I would tie back to just the behavior you see. You once said — I read something you wrote — you said, "Too much arrogance, too much bullshit will be the downfall of Silicon Valley." And it's interesting because that reminds me of a conversation I was having with Rachel Whetstone, who now runs comms at Uber. Shortly after we met, she said, "Do you watch HBO's ‘Silicon Valley?’" And I said, "No, I don't, I tried to watch the first episode and I didn't like it." And she said, "You have to watch it." And I said, "Why do I have to watch it?" She said, "The rest of the world is laughing at us." And I still to this day think half of the people in Silicon Valley don’t know that it's a parody. Ah, it's true. They like it. They like being paid attention to at all, I think. I'll give you another example of the kind of stuff that just makes me cringe. I was at an investor conference last year in Vegas, a private investor conference. That one, I know which one. Where everything leaks out. That private one. So unicorns are presenting, right? One after another. And I probably sit in on eight unicorn presentations, and five of them use the world "trillion." Now I don't think I had heard the word trillion in an investor presentation before that day. That's a big dream. But we had done something in the ecosystem to encourage this type of outlandish promotion — Going to the moon. — where you feel like you need to use words like trillion. And I think it's dangerous when we act like we have the right to disrupt everything or eat every industry, but we're not willing to play by the rules of profitability or GAAP accounting or being public. We look like entitled brats. And I think the end state, the really bad end state of that type of behavior, is we invite regulation from Washington that I prefer we not have. But I think that's possible if we play it too loose. If we play it too loose, if we talk about all these numbers ... Every three or four years, the [Wall Street] Journal has a story about the parties. I think they just recycle the same story, I don't know if it's so much the party ... What I was talking about in that quote was, I was interviewing an author who was writing about how innovation dies and how it's created. And someone asked me, and I said, "Well, it's going to be that. It's the same thing every time." And people discount risk slowly. Like they forget about pain and they forget about layoffs and they forget about that this is supposed to be hard, you need to profitable. And the younger generation, they're taught in very short time windows. So most of the entrepreneurs today weren't around in '99. So they've forgotten. They have no muscle memory of it whatsoever. There is also a mentality, though. If you have a depression-era mentality, you don't do anything, too. That's true, that's true. Absolutes on either end aren't going to get you anywhere. And, in fact, I would suggest that there are two types of entrepreneurs. There's the incredible operator who might be a COO, they hate these times. Because they can't promote. And then there's this hyper-promotional person that only comes to Silicon Valley when the time is right, and then they go away. And boy, those drive me crazy. You start to see the scammers. And you see it in the deal flow, so it goes from being 10 percent hyper promotional to 90. And I've even heard stories that I find hard to believe, but I've heard stories of reputable people in Silicon Valley, "You should overstate your numbers in your fundraising because everyone's doing it and everyone's just going to discount them anyway." If people are really doing that, it's distasteful, you know? Let's talk about what you wrote about the bubble. What were your main worries, and how do you look at them now? There was just an article in the Journal talking about how people are fixing themselves. Do you think that's the case? Somewhat, yeah. I mean look, the piece that Sequoia did, the deck that Sequoia did in ‘09 was extremely helpful to the Benchmark portfolio. Because you went into that next board meeting and everyone had kind of reevaluated where they were. And Katie Benner — who wrote that story that you're talking about — called me and said she started researching this topic and she started calling entrepreneurs, and some of the stuff I had written had inspired them to change their behavior. So that actually means a lot to me if that was a result. If we play these bubbles out, if we just get extremely promotion-to-the-end-state, then you have the type of crash you had in '01, which is complete wipeout. Like, 50 percent of people get laid off. And it'd certainly be better if we can avoid that kind of thing. Are you, as venture capitalists, sort of responsible and indulgent of these entrepreneurs? Because you have Mark — and you were talking about it, but Mark's knocked up the prices. You all knock up the prices quite high. I think everybody, to a certain extent, has to play the game on the field. I like to use the example of Hortonworks and Cloudera. So we're in this company Hortonworks, it's a Hadoop company. Cloudera raises $950 million from Intel. What do you do? You could sit around and say, "We're going to get to profitability," but you're not going to matter. You might as well lock the door and leave the building. So you're forced into a game of capital warfare that you may have not been ready to play. And so I don't know that any one person is responsible. Silicon Valley and venture capital have always been cyclical. And so there's something about human nature that causes us to be increasingly risk-seeking until someone comes along and really punishes everybody. There was that study in Iceland where the banks started taking risks — it's often men, I'm sorry to say, but women don't take the same risks. [Men] underestimate risk rather severely. Right, and there's tons of books that have been written on different types of asset bubbles. There's another contributing factor, I think, right now, which is [that] we've had low global interest rates for the past seven years. And I was fortunate enough this summer to meet Warren Buffett — Chamath [Palihapitiya] was the one that made that happen. But we only had one question each, and I said, "You know, in our industry we're seeing that low interest rates are leading to overt competition that's irrational." And he says, "You bet it is." And he's seeing it in his business as well, and I think it's played out in natural gas and all these other pockets. Real estate in Silicon Valley, right? All these asset prices, because with interest rates so low you just have people looking for yield, so money sloshes around. I always say there's not enough rat holes to shove it all down in Silicon Valley. It's true. I would have never imagined in my life as a venture capitalist that the biggest problem would be too much capital everywhere. So what do you do? Here you are, trying to compete with your Hadoop company and others, what do you do? Do you discipline yourself or do you just go along for the crazy ride? I write about what could go wrong in the hope that it might correct something, but I may not have been very successful at that. You play the game on the field, and the game on the field may be particularly sloppy. You're trying to outraise one another, which perpetuates the problem. You out-hype each other. Yeah. You try and spend more efficiently, even though everyone's losing way more money. And one of my biggest things that I've said about this current time is the risk we're taking because of the size of the losses. If you go back to ‘99, there were a whole bunch of companies going public and everything, but people were still moving towards profitability at $30 or $40 million in revenue. And this is way different. There's way fewer companies, whatever the number of unicorns is, but they're being given piles of money. Hundreds of millions. And burn rates are areas we've never seen before. And steering those back towards profitability, if capital ever becomes scarce, is going to be a really difficult exercise. So how are you going to do that? I don't know. "Put down that free kombucha shake right now!" And look, there's been some things that I think have been super helpful. Tomas speaking out on Kind bars and brick walls, and then you know, this summer over at Dropbox, Drew Houston went out, it looks like he did a press tour about cutting $35 million of perks out of Dropbox and did it in a way that he was proud of. And you've had the Evernote thing as well, where they've corrected some of that stuff. And seeing him as a leader talk about that as a smart exercise is awesome. And a sign, like some of the stuff that Katie wrote about, that we're moving back in the right direction. Do you ever feel you can do anything else to impact entrepreneurs besides writing? What would you write right now, if you were doing that essay? I've got an unwritten blog post about unit economics. One of the things that Silicon Valley does when it gets risk-seeking, which it did in '99 and now, is they invest in businesses with lower and lower gross margins. And that's riskier. And a lot of times those involve consumer products. And then what they do is they start selling them heavily discounted. And there's this old saying about selling dollars for 85 cents. But there's a truism to it. You can create infinite revenue if you sell dollars for 85 cents. And if you give consumers more value than you charge them for, they will love you. And I remind entrepreneurs all the time that Webvan had the highest NPS scores of any company I've ever known. It wasn't that the consumer proposition didn't work, it was that the economics didn't work. They weren't charging enough for the service level. What's interesting about that is that conceptually, it was the right idea. A lot of things are directionally correct, but it wasn't working out on an economic basis. They should have been charging more money, basically. Anyway, we're in one of those time frames. Some of that's starting to get cleaned up. There's probably been more shutdowns this year than in the previous three. Or sales. Or sales. And layoffs. You're starting to smell for the first time. I've heard signs of some real estate correcting. I'm hopeful that it can be a soft landing. Historically, it hasn't been. Right. What could happen? Oh, what could happen? I mean, macro is really hard to get right. And Buffet and those guys don't even try. We've got an election, we've got so much going on. I think the European situation is probably a bigger hotbed. If Italy or something defects from the EU, and the kind of thing that could cause. China's GDP, a lot of people are worried about. I don't have enough knowledge to know whether that could be the catalyst, but it could be. We're talking to Bill Gurley about investing and the bubble and some of the things he's written about it. When we get back, we're going to talk about his current investments and some other thoughts that he has going forward. [ad] ************* We're here with Bill Gurley, the well-known venture capitalist in Silicon Valley who works at Benchmark. He's been involved in lots and lots of companies. He was an analyst before that, but he's one of the most high-profile venture capitalists, VCs, in the Valley. Today, the Journal had a piece about how you guys are doing pretty well. Little bit of smack-around of Andreessen Horowitz. How do you judge yourselves? It's difficult. The venture industry, as I mentioned earlier, you have to be very fortunate to fall on what people sometimes refer to as positive black swans, these break-out plays. And I think you could spend your whole career and do extremely well and never get behind one of the ones: A Facebook, a Google, that kind of thing. And it's almost impossible to predict ahead of time what's going to turn into something like that. And so it just creates a ton of anxiety. I would also say that it's an extremely cyclical business and so you might be doing well in '99 and really eating crow in '01 or '02. And so it goes up and down and it's hard. What we try and do internally is we keep track of what we're doing, what our competitors are doing and what are the deals or investments that we regret not doing. And we just constantly talk about it. What are the regrets? What are the investments? We'll talk about the ones you've done. Right now? It's the obvious ones. It's Airbnb, Pinterest, Slack, GitHub is one that we're fascinated with. I think the Collison brothers at Stripe are … Which you didn't do? Which we didn't do. I like them more than their business, but I really like them. Pinterest? On them, it's just like the thing I said about growth mindset. Like, learn-it-alls. They're nuts. They're just begging for information, which I love. I think with Pinterest it's just the size and scope. It got way bigger than we would have predicted. And the others? Slack, I think it's fairly obvious. It's a viral enterprise tool. And you didn't think that would be. Well, there had been Yammer. It was a pivot, it was a game company. Yeah it was, I remember. You can't kiss them all. And Airbnb, you know, Matt brought it in like his first week he had joined us. And we got caught up on one of our rules about ownership and redid it for a lower ownership. One of your rules. Do you think you should have rules? What are your biggest rules? You try to maximize ownership, take a board seat. There aren't that many [rules]. No academics in garages. You can get into trouble. And one of the games you play in venture is to know which rules to break at the right time. And so we constantly challenge ourselves. Like, "Should we maybe be dropping this rule at this moment in time because things are changing?" Does that make you the most insecure people on the planet? It might. It feels like it sometimes. Chasing the breakout. And when the close happens on one of those, it's actually a really perverse element of the venture industry. Like the moment that John Doerr and Mike Moritz closed the Google investment, which was probably all of a week and half, it was the biggest event in both those firms for over a decade. Yeah, without even knowing it at the time. And something had happened in a week and a half. And for a lot of those companies, and I'll include the ones we're in, if you worked there it probably would have come out that way anyway. So the seminal event was that closing event that was very quick. Right, and decisions were made quickly. Often on a instinct, actually. And in that case, like we talked about previously, most people's instincts would say, "Don't do it." So talk about what you did do. Obviously your biggest — there's a couple at Benchmark, but Uber is one of your big ones. I've talked to all of you about how that happened and various people, of course, take credit all the time and this and that. But it really was Matt and then you others there. And it went back and forth actually, initially. Having come out of OpenTable being successful, I was trying to think of other industries where, if you put a network on top of [it, that] would absorb waste and make it more efficient and more usable. And the thesis of cars had come up, and we had met with several taxi [startups] — there were actually taxi startups before Uber. And we had quickly come to the conclusion that doing it on top of taxi wasn't the right way to do it because prices were fixed, they’re oligopolies, there's regulation, and if anyone did it on town cars, we would pay attention. So that was a thesis we had internally when they popped up. Which was a town car kind of offering. Ride in style, whatever it was. Yeah, so we immediately cold-called them, and I remember meeting with Ryan and Travis at a restaurant and then I brought them [in]. This was before their seed round, and this is the part you're talking about about going back and forth. And they presented the company to us for the seed round and we chose not to do it at that point in time. And then for the next three or four months … What that like, Calacanis and Sacca were in that one, right? That's right. And then over the next three or four months Matt became, I think, the No. 1 rider on Uber. And as he's done many times in our partnership — … This is Matt Cohler ... — he came into the room screaming, "We have to do it! We have to do it! We have to do it!" And so we got aggressively in front of the series A. And what did you think at the time? What would happen here? Of the entrepreneur, Travis, and obviously Garrett Camp was involved and others. Between the time we looked at the seed and when we did the A, Travis had moved into the CEO position. At the beginning we were just studying him as an angel investor in the thing, and probably by the time the A came around he was the CEO. It was hard. Like I said, we had a theory that it could be like OpenTable. So you know, OpenTable was sold for like $3 billion or something. So I'd be inaccurate if I suggested we had a vision that it could one day cause people to question car ownership. I never had considered that. And what do you think of the person? He's quite aggressive. He is, he is. So Matt had known him for a while. I actually called Mark Cuban, because Cuban had been an investor in Red Swoosh, and they had ended up in a disagreement, yet Mark had walked away thinking Travis was remarkably professional even though they had different points of opinion, which I took as a positive. I like to think I knew how passionate he was. But I didn't. We were taking a chance. I'm remarkably thrilled, now that we're involved, to see a guy who's just so committed to what he does. Right, but some say too committed, too aggressive. Do you provide, "Slow this the hell down, stop arguing with people." You know, it's funny, in the book I mentioned earlier, "Grit," this woman Angela Duckworth had studied all these people that have been successful. And she claims, and there's a big TED video that's only six minutes which is quicker to watch than reading the book, but she says the key characteristic that differentiates successful people from unsuccessful isn't IQ, it's grit. And she describes grit as passionate perseverance. And on those two dimensions, I think Travis may be completely on the far rail. One of the board members described him as "remarkably all-in." You know? Yeah. But that can become abrasive and irritating, which to many it has. Completely understand. I do think that most VCs would probably yearn for most of their founders and CEOs to have some of this grit. Does that have to change, and do you have an impact on that? I think every one of the entrepreneurs that gets thrown into the limelight in the way that he has — And with failures before. He really did have a lot of trouble. By the way, I think those contribute to the grit. Oh absolutely, I think it's right at the heart of it. He spent so much time on these startups and one of them went bankrupt and one he sold for $20 million. And in the first one he sort of got screwed by his investors. Absolutely. And just years and years of trying. I often think that the grit is driven by some kind of obligation to the Entrepreneur Society of America. Because he knows how hard it is to be on one of the ones that's not working. Yeah, I felt it was rage. It was just like, "This one's going to work." And so you get on one that has the wind at your back instead of your face and you're like, "I'm going to play it for all it's worth." And I do feel like that's part of the motivation. So, just finishing up on Uber, obviously you're on the board, correct? Correct. When is it going public? You know, I don't think that we're going to be going public anytime in the near future because of all the issues that we just talked about. We have a large number of competitors, even with the deal done. Well done, by the way. Thank you. [Competitors] who are very deep pocketed, who have decided that their primary form of competition is not going to be like building a different app or a differentiated service or a different level, it's just price. And so there are intense subsidy battles going on. All over the world. All over the world. And those companies, when they approach investors, tell them, "Uber is going to go public, and then they're going to have to be profitable, and then we're really going to sneak up on them with these discounts." While that's the game on the field, and it's one that I find to be remarkably messy and ugly, I don't think it would be in our best interest. So raising more money is the way to go. I don't know if we need to. We have $9 billion in the bank and $2 billion of debt, which is the most any private company has ever raised. Does that frighten you? Yeah, but two things. One, I do think that it is one of the best product market fits that has ever come along. And as I've come to realize what's possible here, there is a real opportunity to literally change the face of America. You talked about that early on, I remember. Like car ownership has gotten way too far in our country. 2.3 per household. I agree. And parking lots. Houston has like 4.5 parking spots per car. And there's an opportunity to change it. You can actually lower housing pricing if you remove parking requirements. So we're doing deals now with developers and getting cities to approve them to have parking-free housing. It's definitely hit into a bigger trend. A bigger, more important trend. And if you survey people, Recode had an article about a survey, and even though the Recode article was a little dismissive, it said 8 percent of the people in the survey said that ride-sharing had a strong likelihood to impact car buying decisions. That's 8 percent. This stuff only existed five years ago. Yup, it's like smartphones, early on. Yeah, what will that number be five years from now? Absolutely, I don't drive my car anymore. I think it's a leading edge. I know a ton of people who have gotten rid of their cars. Does that ruin the idea of public [transportation]? I was at a meeting the other day talking about how private transportation companies do not take the place of public transportation. I think most of the ride-sharing companies, if you look at heat maps, and they've published some of these, have huge red areas around public transportation. So most of the effective public transportation, which isn't buses, it's the subways and rails, they can't get to that last mile. And there have been studies done that suggest they're symbiotic. That they actually drive more usage of each. So let's talk about — we're going to finish up in just a minute — what else are you in now that you think is very exciting? What makes you excited? A couple. I'd probably mention three. So, Nextdoor, which is a social network for the local neighborhood that's really starting to grow. Which also has issues around racism ... They've done a really good job of addressing those in the past couple of weeks. They're trying. It's like Twitter, it's humanity, right? Absolutely. Although mine is just horrible. Is there any black person who can walk down the street that's not suspect? I'm like, "Can you stop?" Yeah, they've just come out with a whole bunch of new programs on this front. I think some of the initial people that were upset have come around and sanctioned what they're doing. So I feel good about how they've done that. Tools are important. Why do you like that one? If you go back to like 2006, the local advertising market was like 110 billion. And many of the avenues people would use to microcast advertising were radio, newspapers, magazines. They've come under threat from digital disruption, and there's not a place for people to bring that out. I also think by having a social network in the neighborhood, there's lots of features that you can implement over time. We're starting to do some of those now. And also because we're not dependent on anyone. We're not an SEO company, we didn't build on the back of Facebook Connect, we built this out ourselves. Right. It's a bulletin board. It didn't work with AOL, with Patch, which was interesting. Well, Patch is more heavily content-oriented. They did a bunch of anti-intuitive things to make the liquidity come alive. Intuitive funds were from Epinions that had built the UGC network before. I'll mention two others. Stitch Fix is just an incredible company. She's amazing. Katrina Lake's one of the best I've ever worked with. It's right here in the city, most people don't know about it. Explain it. They've built personalized women's fashion. Although they're moving into beta on men's now. And I like to think about it — no woman that's buying fashion wants to think about it this way — but I like to think about it as Moneyball for women's retail. And for every woman that comes in, they fill out a 15-page questionnaire to suss out size, fit, style, whether it's for work or social, and then for every item, we measure 66 characteristics. And then there's a data science team that's over 70 people now. In fact, Stitch Fix is the No. 1 competitor of Uber for data science talent in Silicon Valley. Eric Colson, who runs that group came from Netflix and did all the recommendation stuff there. And so when a customer comes in to ask for a new Fix, which is an interesting drug metaphor, and this package comes to them, we have a predicted keep score for every item in our inventory. Which is a level of analytics brought to this industry that's maybe one or two orders of magnitude above what everybody else is [doing]. Did you know I covered retail for seven years? And one of the companies was hot, and then it wasn't, and I went to the CEO after — it was a teen company, these things go up and down — I said, "What happened?" He goes, "Pedal pushers. I picked pedal pushers and not culottes. And that was the end of me." [laughs] I'm like, "Why?" He's like, "I just guessed." It was really funny, I'll never forget that, "pedal pushers." And that's what retail's been. We're now working with merchandisers who have ideas. And they test the ideas against the algorithm instead of ever shipping them. And so it's really cool. There's an article written on her recently called "Moneyball Fashionista" that has the whole [thing]. Huh, interesting. There's all kind of interesting experiments going on in retail. Yeah, it's really cool. All right, you get one more. What else? I'd probably talk about HackerOne. Oh, I don't know that one. So Sheryl once said that the smartest thing Facebook ever did on the security front was start a bug bounty program. And bug bounty means you basically pay the hackers to find the holes before the bad guys do. Yeah there's all kinds of crowd-sourcing on this. Yeah. Microsoft, Facebook, Mozilla, there've been people who have done this before, but they all did it kind of holistically within their own firm. Alex Rice, who worked on these programs at Facebook, created a startup that will allow anyone to have a bug bounty program. So in like 18 months, we've got over 500 customers including Priceline, Salesforce, Uber, GM, Home Depot, the Pentagon. And they're all now running bug bounty programs. And then we have a marketplace of all the hackers and all the reputations and skill sets. And it's really cool. And I think you look at the problem, huge problem, most of the solutions are defensive where you're just throwing hardware and software. And this one's offensive, right? Because you're fighting the battle in front of them. I see, interesting. It's elegant. And Mårten Mickos, who ran MySQL, is the CEO over there now. Oh, that's a really interesting company. And he's awesome. So what is overhyped? What would I say is overhyped ... You can name names. Well, some of the categories that become difficult, I would say, in this type of world, are ones where capital can create this messy playing field that I'm talking about. And one of those where I think that's happened is in the online lending space. Aha, there's a lot of those. SoFi, others. SoFi and Avant have raised a billion dollars and Lending Co. went public, and there's OnDeck and Square, and it's like, if everyone just starts aggressively giving away money, it's hard to build a business, you know? And so those are the things that get dangerous. I would say that some of the ones where we over-choreograph are difficult. Like VR, because the big guys all pull out their R&D teams and their guns, so Samsung and HTC and Facebook, they're all at the table. Most big startup breakouts are where people aren't paying attention. As opposed to where everybody's got their guns lined up. Do you like VR? I think that the screen resolution is not there yet. And a lot of the demos to get people excited are on $30, $40,000 equipment. Right, exactly. And it's hard to use. And you put on the stuff that you can buy today and it's pixelated. I had a big argument with someone about this. And so I do think there's a risk that we run into what's known as a trough of disillusionment before you get a breakout because of that. What about current companies, I'll finish up with this. Twitter. I ask everyone. You know, I'm one of the biggest optimists about what's possible out of Twitter. Most people feel that way. Primarily because the most important people in the world are curating their persona there. And you can get them to do more work than they're already doing today. Yeah, it was interesting, because Mike McCue is a former board member who is running for the board. He said it's a bigger phenomenon than it is a company. Look, it may be. I think running businesses at scale is probably the most underrated activity in Silicon Valley relative to how hard it is, you know. How hard it is? I know you guys are all like, "It's so hard." I'm like, "I thought you're the smartest people on earth." Fair enough. I don't really care because you're all rich and smart. Fair enough, but what [John] Donahoe did at eBay is really really hard. And most entrepreneurs like to take potshots at big companies in a way that I think is disrespectful. What do you imagine will happen to it, then? There's always a chance that there's a sale process. I guess Ev [Williams] was rumored in the press yesterday talking about that. I think there's a lot of opportunity to kind of micro-segment around interest groups, because today the way the feed's oriented. If I love all country music, which I do — Me too. — if Ryan Adams happens to say something at the right time, I find it. I thought you could mine the feed and build a Techmeme for everything. And so there could be an alt-country newspaper that it’s pulling from, and you have a ranking table. I've talked to Jack [Dorsey] and the team about it. I hope one day they do it. I think it could lead to something. What happens to these companies? I think the problem is a smallish company gets a lot of attention because of journalists, and then it's sort of a narrative, the way Yahoo became. Yup. It's possible. And it gets sucked up into that. Yeah. It's possible, you know. There's a lot of heat, pressure. What is a mistake that you've made and learned from, as a venture capitalist or investor, anything. You talked about being too analytical and missing some of the instinctual stuff. Is there anything you did that you're like, "Oh I shoulda done it this way?" Or what do you tell entrepreneurs? The immediate thing that comes to my mind was the Google investment, because you can't make a bigger mistake. I was trying to think of another one since we already talked about that. That's a big one. But what went on there as an investor? As I mentioned, some of the external data points lead you to have some amount of skepticism. The product usage was already starting to happen. We were all using it in our office. It was a better product, so we can't blame that. And we were already talking about, "Oh you just do what GoTo did." So the business motto really wasn't a question either. Everyone was already saying that. I think it came down to the price at the time was remarkably high, and the team was remarkably self-confident in a way that would cause you to question whether they could pull it off. But they did. And I go back, I think the learning is that if you have remarkably asymmetric returns, you have to ask yourself, "How high could up be?" And then that "what could go right?" question. Because it's not a 50/50 thing on the judgment call. Like, if you thought it was a 20 percent chance at doing it, you should still do it, because the upside is so high. Right. What do you want to invest in? What interests you a great deal now? Like AI, everyone's either terrified with it or thrilled with it. I've been spending a lot of time looking at the health care space. Ah, you're going to wade in there. Well, I look at the technologies, I look at the smartphone, I look at what we've done with UGC plays, I look at what we've done even with Zillow and real estate. And I say, "Boy, this thing's really messed up, we ought to be able to fix it." Now, my first two years of looking at stuff has caused me to step back a little bit because it is atrociously complex. And the way that regulation works, the way that the payers, the company who doesn't even really want to be in the process ... They've made quite a thicket, haven't they? Oh, it's so messed up. There are some little signs of seedlings that it could become more of a payer situation. And we're an investor in One Medical, which I think is exploiting this. Like, "The customer wants to be treated like a customer, and they haven't been in this space." And if you implement something where they feel that way ... Well, you endure a lot. Oh god, it's ridiculous. It's so ridiculous. So health care. Anywhere else? AI? Yeah, we look at that kind of stuff. I tend to like the stuff that's applied in machine learning and AI, like a Stitch Fix, rather than building something to sell to somebody. The things that Amazon is doing in both e-tailing and AWS causes you to rewrite your entire rule set. And it is changing so fast that almost everything we've done in the past, we've got to reconsider. All right, last question. Are we in a bubble, Mr. Gurley? Mr. Anti-bubble? Are we in a bub-bull? I think certainly we have taken on more risk than we realize and there will be consequences of that. Because there's so much money in these things, nothing goes away overnight. And a few very well-known companies have already been recap, which means that the investors that were on the cap chartered zero. And you don't see that. The thing is still bumbling along. I'd like to see that, you can send me those. But I think there'll be more of that over time. More of that. And sales, too. Yup. And see the sales of things as they go, like LinkedIn and others. I think those are the signs of something profound. Yeah, I think those happen because, well, two things. I think when the markets stop going only up and to the right — prior to that, a lot of the unicorn entrepreneurs were thinking infinity is the top, and so all of a sudden you shake that a little bit and they get a little more reality. And the you might be able to bridge a bit with an acquire. So Bill Gurley's still worried? I am. But maybe that's my universal state. Yeah, I think it is. All right, Bill, thank you so much for coming. No problem, thanks for having me. recode_divider More From Recode DraftKings and FanDuel used to hate each other. What happened?

A previous rumor suggested Samsung is looking into developing a Lightning-like port of its own that would support audio so that it could also remove the 3.5mm headphone jack from its future devices. But the USB Implementers Forum published the Audio Device Class 3.0 specification that will help Samsung, and any other company, make the jump from 3.5mm to USB-C for audio. DON’T MISS: A painful reminder of just how bad the iPhone 7’s battery life is The USB Audio Device Class 3.0 spec brings USB Audio over USB Type-C, which means mobile devices including smartphones, tablets and ultraportable laptops could ditch the headphone jack in the very near future without worrying about having to bake audio support into USB-C or a new, proprietary port. Audio over USB-C means that consumers need to upgrade their headphones to USB-C headphones as well, but the audio gains might be worth it. And the sound quality isn’t the only thing that’s improving. Removing the ungracefully-aging 3.5mm headphone jack would let companies shave up to a millimeter off of product thickness — that means even slimmer phones could be coming in the near future. Removing the 3.5mm audio port from a handset also helps with waterproofing. As for the new sound features that USB-C will usher in, we’re looking at better digital audio support, power-saving features and keyword detection. USB-C headphones will offer a better sound experience while consuming less battery power. They’ll also facilitate voice-recognition features, Engadget explains. Intel already explained a few months ago that sound over USB-C is the future, and it’s likely that many device makers will adopt it. In addition to Apple, Motorola and LeEco have already launched smartphones that do not have dedicated headphone jacks. Samsung may follow soon, now that the USB-C audio spec is finally official. That said, this is still speculation based on what’s currently happening in the mobile world, and Samsung has yet to say anything about its next-gen mobile devices.

TechRadar The source for Tech Buying Advice Search RSS Reviews How To Phones TVs Laptops Deals Photography More Car Tech Wearables Tablets Components Audiovisual Gaming Computing Downloads News Pro Trending MacBook Pro Nintendo Switch Google Pixel iOS 10.1 PS4 Pro Early Black Friday Deals News Google Andromeda: everything you need to know Google Andromeda: everything you need to know By Joe Osborne Operating systems   Plus, every Pixel 3 detail we've heard so far Shares On October 4, Google is expected to reveal its plans for something that has been rumored about and reported on for over a year: a merging of its Android and Chrome OS in a way we've never before seen. It's called internally "Andromeda", according to reports by Android Police and 9to5 Google, and it's expected to become the singular platforms through which people access Google – so laptops, phones and tablets. These same reports also make mention of a hybrid, laptop-tablet device that will possibly be shown off during the otherwise Pixel phone-centered event, running the Andromeda OS. Also, why do we seem so sure that Google will have something to say about this Andromeda business? "We announced the 1st version of Android 8 years ago today," Google SVP of Android, Chrome OS & Play Hiroshi Lockheimer tweeted on September 24. "I have a feeling 8 years from now we'll be talking about Oct 4, 2016." That's why. So, let's get on with it, eh? Cut to the chase What is it? An Android-meets-Chrome, multi-device operating system When is it out? Current reports point to sometime in 2017 What will it cost? Likely nothing, as is with Android and Chrome If you ask us, either this was inspired by Andromeda, or this was the beginning What is Andromeda? First off, it's reportedly the code name for Google's oft-rumored-and-reported merging of its Android and Chrome OSes, the former being a phone and tablet platform and the latter one for its affordable laptop platform, Chromebooks. We've even seen the seeds of such a merging be sowed this year. At Google I/O 2016, the firm announced that Android apps would become available on Chromebooks, finally necessitating the odd-few Chromebooks with touchscreens. But, more importantly, this expressed Google's interest in marrying these two platforms together. Fast forward to today, and reporters expect Andromeda to offer the flexibility of a mobile OS in terms of an adaptable interface and sophisticated touch gesture support, but with the sensible – and more readily-accessible – file system and other niceties we've come to expect from our laptops. Android Police specifically claims to have heard from sources that Andromeda is the result of Google introducing Chrome features to Android, not the other way around. The outlet also suggests that the initiative to get Android apps running on Chromebooks is unrelated to Andromeda, but at the very least one had to inspire the other, whichever that is. We should count on seeing this piece of hardware more than a laptop What is the Pixel 3 – or Bison? In the same report, some of which has been corroborated by 9to5 Google's sources, Android Police details a device internally named "Bison", a hybrid computing gadget that's been already nicknamed "Pixel 3," or the de facto successor to the second Chromebook Pixel. However, that name barely applies, because the device is allegedly to not be marketed as a Chromebook, but as an entirely new approach from Google to computing. While the outlet did receive specification information from its source, it was quick to present them with a helping of salt based on when it expects Bison to release: Q3 2017. The Pixel 3 is expected to be a convertible hybrid, though some anticipate a detachable, that will come in two versions with 12.3-inch touch displays. Powering the device with be either an Intel Core m3 or Core i5 processor with either 32GB or 128GB of storage, and either 8GB or 16GB of memory (RAM). Also standard on what's assumed to be two models are, reportedly, two USB-C ports, a fingerprint scanner, 3.5mm audio jack, a bunch of sensors and stylus compatibility, with a Wacom pen sold separately. The device will also allegedly have stereo speakers, quad microphones and a battery that can last about 10 hours. Android Police also reports that the keyboard will be backlit, and the glass trackpad will use haptic feedback and force detection, similar to the 12-inch MacBook. The device is said to measure 10mm thin, which would noticeably beat Apple's thinnest laptop yet. Again, take these details with the appropriate dashing of salt, but the outlet also says to have heard that the Pixel 3 will start at $799 (about £622, AU$1,041), too. Sidenote: 9to5 Google expects the firm to release Andromeda on a Nexus-branded Huawei tablet as well, based on claims from its sources and evidence that Google has been testing the OS on a Nexus 9 tablet already. But, what will this mean for Google's hyper-affordable computers? Who knows... What could Andromeda mean for Android and Chrome? From what we're hearing, Andromeda seems to be Google's response to Microsoft and Apple's united platforms with one of its own. In turning Android into one of the main places from which Google's billions of users access the service and later capitalizing on that with Chrome OS in the classroom and workplace, Google itself has become the third major player in platforms. Again, from the sound of it, Andromeda is going to accomplish much of what Microsoft and Apple already have in Windows 10 and iOS-to-macOS Sierra Continuity, respectively, but in a very Google way. It's easy to expect access to Google's inimitable search and data-tracking at your fingertips, which it would tout as better than Microsoft's and Apple's, and an interface the changes based on the device from which it's accessed. Will this eventually mean the end of Android and Chrome? In name, most likely, but their principles would almost certainly live on – there's too much solid foundation not to build on top of it. Some predict this transition will happen gradually, and we're inclined to agree. The end result, likely to be seen long from now, will be just one platform for Google to worry about, able to push new updates and features to all versions at once, simplifying support as well as user understanding. Nevertheless, Lockheimer's tweet suggests something monumental for the October 4 event, so stay here with us as we update this article with the details once they all roll in.

The First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index Fund (NasdaqGS: TDIV) has increased 11.0% over the past three months and gained 18.5% year-to-date. The technology sector has been gaining momentum in recent months after falling out of favor along with other growth stocks at the start of a volatile year.

Furthermore, the ongoing search for yield has also supported some technology stocks, reports Aaron Kuriloff for the Wall Street Journal. Specifically, three of the top four Dow industrial components over the past three months include tech stocks with relatively high dividends, including Apple (NasdaqGS: AAPL), Intel Corp. (NasdaqGS: INTC) and Microsoft Corp. (NasdaqGS: MSFT). “There are certainly plenty of high-quality, stable tech companies delivering dividend yield,” Tony DeSpirito, portfolio manager for the BlackRock Equity Dividend Fund, told the WSJ. Moreover, with bond yields still hovering near historic lows and growth under pressure in Europe and Japan, many yield-hungry investors will continue to look for alternative sources for income. Consequently, investors who want exposure to a potential rebound in earnings growth and dividend yields can look to TDIV, which tracks an index of technology dividend-paying stocks. Underlying components have paid a regular or common dividend with the past 12 months, with a yield of at least 0.5%, and have not had a decrease in dividends per share within the past 12 months. TDIV shows a 2.46% 12-month yield. In contrast, the broader Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSEArca: XLK) has a 1.84% 12-month yield and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEArca: SPY) has a 2.06% 12-month yield.

Scheduler Changes Published For The Linux 4.9 Kernel Written by Michael Larabel in Linux Kernel on 3 October 2016 at 04:39 PM EDT. 13 Comments Ingo Molnar was prompt as usual in submitting his various pull requests for the opening of the Linux 4.9 merge window, including the scheduler changes.

The changes are scattered throughout so read the pull request if you've been curious about whether a certain feature/change affecting you has landed. Sadly, not entering the Linux 4.9 kernel through this scheduler PR or the ACPI/PM updates is the Turbo Boost Max 3.0 changes for Linux in order to enable this capability on the latest Intel (Broadwell-E) CPUs.

The new guidelines from the USB Implementers Forum will help accessory manufacturers get their devices to market more quickly by essentially guiding them through the steps to produce USB-C headphones that don’t suck up power. We've already seen a few USB-C headphones from brands like JBL, but this will speed up the process for other companies. "Fewer connectors will open the door for innovation in countless ways and make it easier to design waterproof or water-resistant devices," USB-IF wrote. See ya later, headphone jack. Intel detailed plans to standardize USB-C audio earlier this year, too, and Apple already provides similar specifications for Lightning port accessories through its MFi program. Obviously Apple's specifications are crucially important given that the iPhone 7 doesn’t come with a headphone jack. Now get ready for an influx of USB-C headphones. Have you poured champagne out / onto your old headphone jack earbuds yet? You really need to get around to doing that.

By Alexandra Steigrad on October 3, 2016 Share This Article Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Print Talk Cindi Leive at Glamour's Women of the Year event in 2015. Lovekin/Variety/REX/Shutterstock Glamour’s marquee event, Women of the Year, has found itself a new home. The event, which will include a summit and awards show, will take place at NeueHouse Hollywood, a private work collective for creative entrepreneurs, on Nov. 14. WWD previously reported on the expansion of Women of the Year and its move to Los Angeles, following a 25-year run in New York, where the awards show took place at Carnegie Hall. This year, Women of the Year, or WOTY, will  include a day of programming, called “The Women of the Year Live Summit,” in which young women will hear from past and present honorees as well as from other influential women from a variety of fields. For those unable to make the trek, the event will be live-streamed for the first time via Facebook Live. The expansion of the WOTY is part of a larger effort at Glamour parent Condé Nast to grow new streams of revenue for its various titles. For Glamour, the event presents an opportunity to grab more advertising dollars, for instance. Case in point: While L’Oréal Paris returns as the title sponsor of the awards for the 15th consecutive year, Glamour has signed on additional sponsors including Aerie, Barbie, Barneys New York, Caterpillar Foundation, Clare V., Dyson, eBay, Everything But The House, Getty Images, Intel, Kim Crawford Wines, Rebecca Minkoff, SoulCycle, StubHub and W Hollywood Hotel. Glamour editor in chief Cindi Leive  said of adding the programming: “Now our audience will be able to hear more extensively from our winners — and millions of women can experience their message through the live-stream as well. Our mission is to support women in determining the course of their own lives, and Women of the Year Live will help them do just that.” According to Glamour, Women of the Year Live will also support its philanthropic initiative The Girl Project, which launched in 2014 and currently supports the secondary-school education of girls in 95 countries around the world. Past Women of the Year honorees include Malala Yousafzai, Secretary Hillary Clinton, Caitlyn Jenner, Lupita Nyong’o, Lady Gaga, Reese Witherspoon, Shonda Rhimes, Gloria Steinem and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Past presenters have included Oprah Winfrey, President Bill Clinton, Bruce Willis, Viola Davis and Natalie Portman. This year’s honorees will be revealed later this fall. You're missing something!

It is literally a pocket-sized PC that can fit in your pockets, its small size and light weight make it ideal to bring anywhere. But it goes beyond just practicality and portability as the RACING P1 brings with it the pedigree of the RACING series with its signature VIVID LED DJ for unrivaled customization like its motherboard counterparts. Limited size but limitless creativity!     For the person always-on-the-go, a laptop maybe a savior but in a BYOD environment, nothing can beat the efficiency of a keyboard and mouse. A tablet may be portable but long-term usage and the lack of expansion ports limits its actual function. Not to mention both are expensive options. The BIOSTAR RACING P1 aims to solve all this by serving as a way to make the PC accessible, usable and portable to get the benefits of the platform without making sacrifices in both performance, space or budget.   The BIOSTAR RACING P1 mini-PC features an Intel Z8350 quad-core processor with clock-speeds up to 1.92G with a maximum TDP of only 2W allowing the BIOSTAR RACING P1 operate completely fanless hence completely silent operation.   The RACING P1 is the definition of style in the RACING series family, decked out in carbon-fibre styling and featuring sports car curves, it doesn't follow the boring box designs that traditional mini-PCs employ. Complimenting this is the impressive adoption of the VIVID LED DJ directly into the RACING P1 and to add more style, BIOSTAR has enabled the use of the 5050 LED strips for use with the RACING P1 directly via the onboard front header. Control how your LED strip and RACING P1 LEDs function with full control via the VIVID LED DJ software.     The BIOSTAR RACING P1 is highly portable and compatible with standard VESA mounts allowing it to be mounted on compatible monitors and displays for a complete, all-in-one solution with minimal clutter saving you desk space and less wiring to bother with.   Full 64GB of internal storage allows adequate space for operating system files and documents and 6-USB slots plus a microSD card reader allows complete expandability for storage.   Visit the new BIOSTAR website at: http://www.biostar.com.tw   Read more about BIOSTAR 30 Years anniversary: http://www.biostar.com.tw/app/en/event/30years/index.htm   For more information on the BIOSTAR RACING P1 go to: http://www.biostar.com.tw/app/en/minipc/introduction.php?S_ID=3#specification   Recommended for You CYBERTRONPC ANNOUNCES SMALL FORM FACTOR SYSTEM WITH...

Resend activation e-mail Technology Lab / Information Technology It came from Redmond: Windows Server 2016 could rattle the competition Server 2016 wants to be your everything—in the cloud, data center, or server closet. by Sean Gallagher - Oct 3, 2016 7:15 pm UTC Login to bookmark 97 Server administrator kaiju hates user password reset requests. Bandai Namco Entertainment America (CC) A couple of decades ago, Microsoft was the kaiju of network computing. First came MS-DOS, and Windows soon followed. Each simply took over business desktops. Before Novell knew what hit it, Windows was then infused with the DNA of OS/2 and became Windows NT and in turn NT Server. Novell had dominated the early PC networking market, but by the end of the 1990s the company was a shadow of its former self. Like a special breed of kaiju, Microsoft's server platform keeps on mutating, incorporating the DNA of its competitors in sometimes strange ways. All the while, Microsoft's offering has constantly grown in its scope, creating variants of itself in the process. Godzilla often retreats, battered after battle, to regenerate, and the monster has spawned multiple variants (Roland Emmerich's 'Zilla is the Microsoft Bob of Godzillas, right?). Windows Server has done the same, coming back again and again to disrupt another server market with a snap of its 80-percent-functionality-for-20-percent-of-cost teeth. In 2016, it's happening again. Microsoft Windows Server 2016 picks up where its predecessor (Server 2012 R2) left off three years ago. The last release of Server strove to elevate the status of Microsoft's server platform. It went from being an also-ran in the movement from on-premises servers to an increasingly virtualized, cloud-based enterprise to being integral to business cloud computing itself. With four different versions (Essentials, Hyper-V Server, Standard, and Datacenter), three different deployment schemes ("Desktop experience," Core, and Nano), and an ever-expanding collection of optional features, Server 2016 wants to be everything for everyone. It's a heavyweight virtualization hypervisor! It's a lithe cloud application container! It's a high performance storage platform! It's a hardened security platform! Though, just as our favorite giant monsters are continually misunderstood by the masses, Windows Server 2016 is not likely to be universally embraced. In many ways Server 2016 is late to the party started by other data center kaiju—Linux has offered container virtualization for years, and VMWare already offers virtual storage area networking. But Server 2016's take on each of its roles is fairly solid and (relatively) easy to use compared to the alternatives—especially if you've already got PowerShell veterans around. Thanks to the battle scars Microsoft took in using Server for its own Azure cloud service, Server 2016 now challenges or exceeds the capabilities of its primary virtualization rivals. In other words, it's good enough to do most of what people are doing right now at Windows prices. Server 2016 is not going to quickly dislodge any incumbent vendors from existing data centers, but it will give people with a somewhat smaller budget the sort of capabilities that used to cost a whole lot more. One programming note There's no way to fully explore Server 2016 in a single article, so this is not intended as a full review of the platform. Rather, this serves as an extended first look based on technical preview releases. And because Server 2016 builds so heavily on the big shift made by its two most recent predecessors, Server 2012 and Server 2012 R2, I'm not going to dwell on the cosmetics and basic features of the platform. Based on the early look I had, there have been no significant changes in the graphical user interface of Server other than a little Windows 10 desktop remodeling. A bad day at the on-prem datacenter at Monster Island Inc. A bad day at the on-prem datacenter at Monster Island Inc. Server Manager is essentially the same as it was in Server 2012 R2. Which is what it was in Server 2012. Instead, my focus centers on the significant changes under the hood and some of the most important enhancements to existing features. With this goal in mind, I performed two sets of evaluations. The first was in a virtualized lab running on Azure and set up by Microsoft (recognizable in screenshots by the Contoso domain name) to get some familiarity with key new features. The second evaluation was more free-form on my own lab server farm, in which I set up an on-premises network for the fictional Monster Island Incorporated (where all the admins are kaiju) to get a better feel for the overall evolution of the platform and how well it plays with others. In the on-premises test, I ran a mix of Server 2016 hosts across physical and virtualized systems. There are some aspects of the OS that I could not fully test in time for this review, either because of a lack of support for them in the Technical Preview 5 version of Server 2016 that I used for our first look or because I didn't have enough time and budget to scale up to a size where the features made sense (as with some of the new software-defined networking features). Ars will be evaluating those features once we have the final release in hand and can properly put it through its paces—both on premises and in the cloud. Scaling up the beast To fully enjoy the capabilities of Server 2016—that is, with all the many new things that depend on Microsoft's latest Hyper-V hypervisor code—you will need a server with an Intel or AMD processor compatible with the x64 instruction set. It must also include support for Second Level Address Translation virtualization (EPT on Intel and Nested Paging Tables on AMD). And while it's possible to run Server 2016 in its most minimal, GUI-less forms in 512 megabytes of RAM, you'll need at least 2 gigabytes to boot up the "Desktop Experience." Additionally, you'll need a minimum of 32 gigabytes of disk on a SATA or SCSI controller to boot a physical server, plus at least one PCI Express gigabit Ethernet adapter. Older systems will still run Server 2016 adequately without virtualization. To check, I ran it briefly on Monster Island's "legacy" Dell PowerEdge 2950, the evil twin of the machine that was Hillary Clinton's basement e-mail server. But for those looking to scale up, Windows Server 2016 is much beefier than its predecessors (something we didn't have the hardware budget to test): Windows Server 2012/2012 R2 Standard and Datacenter Windows Server 2016 Standard and Datacenter Physical (host) memory support Up to 4TB per physical server Up to 24TB per physical server Physical (host) logical processor support Up to 320 Up to 512 Expand full story Page: 1 2 3 Next → Reader comments 97 You must login or create an account to comment.

Freedman | September 30, 2016 MORE $99.99 Editors' rating: The Pros Affordable; Dynamic background removal; Strong audio and video quality The Cons Finicky to set up; Hard to stream in low light Verdict The Logitech C922 Pro Stream Webcam may take a few tries to set up, but it's the cheapest alternative to a green screen for game streaming at an affordable price. Review Streaming video games has become really big business. Some streamers have elaborate setups with green screens so that they can show you more of the game rather than their messy apartments, but that takes a lot of room and money. Logitech's $99.99 C922 Pro Stream Webcam takes out a lot of the cost and the space by using software to remove or replace the background, making you look like a pro for a fraction of the dough. It's not as reliable as using a real green screen, but the C922 is much easier to use, and it also happens to be a great everyday webcam. article continued below Design The C922 is the spitting image of Logitech's C920, our favorite webcam. It shares the C920's chunky, all-black casing, with microphones that flank both sides of the 1080p lens, and it even has the same lengthy 6-foot cord sticking out the back.A rear-mounted arm secures the camera onto your laptop lid or external monitor. Just like the C920, it worked great on a variety of laptops and displays that I tested.The part that stands out is that the C922 comes with a tripod. It features a 360-degree swivel mount and its legs extend from 4.3 inches to 7.3 inches. We haven't seen a webcam that comes with a tripod before, and that makes the C922 a great starter kit for those who want one. (If you're one of those who don't need a tripod, see below for a version without it.)  MORE: Best Dell and Alienware Laptops Picture and Sound Quality Like its predecessor, the C922 takes great photos, and videos with clear audio. Whether you're playing Overwatch on Twitch or holding a conference over Skype, you're going to look and sound good doing it. I snapped some photos in the well-lit Laptop Mag labs and was pleased by the precise details and color accuracy. I saw all of the black stripes on my royal blue shirt, which looked great on-screen. I could make out individual hairs on my head and in my beard as well as the dings on the edges of the cardboard boxes that were piled up behind me. The only issue was that the light coming in through the windows was blown out. Logitech claims that the C922 has improved low-light correction over the C920, though I preferred the older model's photos. When I compared the two, the C922's photos had a bluish tint, while the C920 had a more natural look. The microphones on the C922 record stellar sound. When I replayed test video that I shot, my voice was crystal-clear, and I could hear the sharp sound of my knuckles crackling. I even heard a colleague who was talking and typing several feet away. Software and Streaming The C922 isn't designed to work with the C920's webcam utility. Instead, it comes with apps that are specifically designed for streaming. Logitech partnered with Personify to build proprietary software called ChromaCam. This recognizes the streamer and creates a green-screen effect behind the person, which removes the background. Alternatively, you can pick a number of preset backgrounds or upload your own image to serve as your backdrop. While it's meant for game streaming -- where it places your head and torso on top of the game -- you can use it for any video application, including video chat software like Skype. Logitech also throws in a three-month license to XSplit Gamecaster and Broadcaster (six months if you get a configuration without a tripod -- see below). You can use XSplit for free, but the subscription lets you remove backgrounds, edit recordings and get notifications about new followers. If you don't use XSplit, the C922 is also designed to work with Open Broadcaster Software (OBS). If you're starting your streaming setup from scratch, all this software might be somewhat overwhelming. But for those who already use XSplit Gamecaster or OBS to stream, adding ChromaCam is a simple process. After making a few settings changes in XSplit or OBS, you're ready to go. The C922 can stream an image of the user at 30 frames per second at 1080p or 60 fps at 720p.I played Rise of the Tomb Raider on the Asus ROG Strix GL50VS-DB71 with a 2.6-GHz Intel Core i7-6700HQ CPU, 16GB of RAM and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 GPU with 8GB VRAM, and decided it would be a perfect time for a little streaming. I hooked up my Twitch and XSplit accounts and streamed Lara Croft not-so-stealthily running through a Soviet base, dodging guards and climbing zip lines on High settings. Performance was sporadic with the camera running, ranging from 30 to 65 fps, though this will vary based on your rig, internet connection and the game's individual settings. Later, I played Hitman on default settings while streaming over OBS, and stayed at a more consistent 50 fps while recording as I pursued an assassination target on a yacht. In bright light, the background removal works quite well, but the setup can be finicky. In our lab, I found that the camera occasionally cut off the top of my head, or the frame included a pile of boxes along with my torso. Resetting ChromaCam tended to do the trick, and once I configured it to my liking, it stayed there. It takes a bit of finagling, but if you do it all before you broadcast, it should look fine throughout. It's not as reliable as a real green screen, but it should do the trick.  MORE: The Best Gaming Laptops You can stream with a friend in the shot, too, thanks to the wide-angle lens. When testing, we managed to fit two people on the screen together at the same time while we played a game. In low-light situations, the camera couldn't find me at all, and I had to delay my streaming until I got more light into the room. Even then, it only caught my head and part of my chest. Because the C922 opted for a software solution instead of Intel's processor-powered 3D RealSense camera, it is compatible with far more computers. Unlike the RealSense camera, Logitech doesn't require a 6th-generation Intel Core CPU or Windows 10; gamers with older rigs or running Windows 7 or 8 can use the C922. Configurations Logitech is selling two versions of the C922 webcam at the same $99 price point, depending on your needs. The version I reviewed had a tripod and a three-month license to XSplit, and will be available on Logitech's web site and at Best Buy under the C922 Pro Stream Webcam branding. If you love XSplit and don't need a tripod, the C922x (also $99) is the exact same camera, but comes with a six-month license for XSplit and ditches the tripod. That version will be sold exclusively on Amazon. Bottom Line For those without the space or wallet for a green screen, the Logitech C922 Pro Stream Webcam is the next best thing. It can be a bit tedious to set up, and it requires a fair bit of software, but when it works, it looks pretty damn good. It also doesn't hurt that it happens to be a pretty strong webcam for ordinary video chatting.If you just need a great webcam or don't care about background removal, the Logitech C920 is a better deal. You can find it on Amazon for as low as $68, and despite the lack of bells and whistles, it's our favorite webcam on the market.For gamers, the C922 is the best of both worlds, thanks to the free software and tripod. What's important is that you get great picture and sound, whether you're using it for Twitch or Skype (though you may want to keep the light on). Is it as good as a real green screen? No, but it's a good alternative for the money.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing IBM, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon form enormous AI partnership IBM, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon form enormous AI partnership By Graham Templeton on September 29, 2016 at 12:15 pm Comment On Wednesday, the world learned of a new industry association called the Partnership on Artificial Intelligence, and it includes some of the biggest tech companies in the world. IBM, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon have all signed on as marquis members, though the group hopes to expand even further over time. The goal is to create a body that can provide a platform for discussions among stakeholders and work out best practices for the artificial intelligence industry. Not directly mentioned, but easily seen on the horizon, is its place as the primary force lobbying for smarter legislation on AI and related future-tech issues. Best practices can be boring or important, depending on the context, and in this case they are very, very important. Best practices could provide a framework for accurate safety testing, which will be important as researchers ask people to put more and more of their lives in the hands of AI and AI-driven robots. This sort of effort might also someday work toward a list of inherently dangerous and illegitimate actions or AI “thought” processes. One of its core goals is to produce thought leadership on the ethics of AI development. So, this could end up being the bureaucracy that produces our earliest laws of robotics, if not the one that enforces them. The world “law” is usually used metaphorically in robotics. But with access to the lobbying power of companies like Google and Microsoft, we should expect the Partnership on AI to wade into discussions of real laws soon enough. For instance, the specifics of regulations governing self-driving car technology could still determine which would-be software standard will hit the market first. With the founding of this group, Google has put itself in a position to perhaps direct that regulation for its own benefit. But, boy, is that ever not how they want you to see it. The group is putting in a really ostentatious level of effort to assure the world it’s not just a bunch of technology super-corps determining the future of mankind, like some sort of cyber-Bilderberg Group. The group’s website makes it clear that it will have “equal representation for corporate and non-corporate members on the board,” and that it “will share leadership with independent third-parties, including academics, user group advocates, and industry domain experts.” Well, it’s one thing to say that, and quite another to live it. It remains to be seen if the group will actually comport itself as it will need to if it wants real support from the best minds in open source development. Below, the Elon Musk-associated non-profit research company OpenAI responds to the announcement with a rather passive-aggressive word of encouragement. We're looking forward to non-profits being included as first-class members in the future. — OpenAI (@OpenAI) September 28, 2016 The effort to include non-profits and other non-corporate bodies makes perfect sense. There aren’t many areas in software engineering where you can claim to be the definitive authority if you don’t have the public on-board. Microsoft, in particular, is painfully aware of how hard it is to push a proprietary standard without the support of the open-source community. Not only will its own research be stronger and more diverse for incorporating the “crowd,” any recommendations it makes will carry more weight with government and far more weight with the public. You won’t find Uber in this group right now — but you might soon enough. That’s why it’s so notable that some major players are absent from this early roll coll — most notably Apple and Intel. Apple has long been known to be secretive about its AI research, even to the point of hurting its own competitiveness, while Intel has a history of treating AI as an unwelcome distraction. Neither approach is going to win the day, though there is an argument to be made that by remaining outside the group, Apple can still selfishly consume any insights it releases to the public. Leaving such questions of business ethics aside, robot ethics remains a pressing problem. Self-driving cars illustrate exactly why, and the classic thought experiment involves a crowded freeway tunnel, with no room to swerve or time to brake. Seeing a crash ahead, your car must decide whether to swerve left and crash you into a pillar, or swerve right and save itself while forcing the car beside you right off the road itself. What is moral, in this situation? Would your answer change if the other car was carrying a family of five? Right now these questions are purely academic. The formation of groups like this show they might not remain so for long.

To join in with the discussions yourself email gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk   They got Gary Haven’t written in ages, but my word XCOM 2 is brilliant – spent the whole weekend re-creating my friends as soldiers, then sending them out to take on the various alien scum in lots of different scenarios. The funny thing is when random soldier B dies I don’t really care. but when its Col. Gary ‘Stretch’ Wilson with 28 confirmed kills it’s a complete travesty and generally prompts a re-load to start the mission again. How anyone completes this on iron man mode I’ll never know, but once I complete it on normal I intend to give it a go. Game of the year: 9.5/10. Taking of ½ a point for the long load times and screen tearing, but small compromise to finally get to play it on console. Anon   No one said it’d be easy I’m really enjoying XCOM 2 at the moment, but one thing you didn’t mention in your review, GC. is how punishing the difficulty is compared to Enemy Unknown/Within. I think the creators must’ve recently played too many roguelikes because even on normal difficulty the challenge is rock hard. I’ll explain (mild spoilers ahead). In XCOM 2 you fight enemies from the off that are as dangerous as some of the aliens you initially met around the middle of Enemy Within. You’re also usually outnumbered 3 to 1, plus the aliens have better weapons and armour than you and skills that can devastate your squad. In addition, unlike the previous games, where you could take your time playing strategically using cover and overwatch, most missions are under strict time constraints that force you to run insanely across the map, abandoning your tactics on the way. Enemies spawn out of the blue and get a free movement turn as they arrive, so you’re regularly trapped in a frontal battle that quickly escalates with a flanking attack by fresh enemies. That’s without even considering mind control, reanimated corpses, imposter enemies, and soldiers that go insane when they witness a squad-mate getting wounded. I was squad wiped three times on my first normal playthrough and was left with only a couple of rookies, so I’ve had to start a second playthrough on easy difficulty. I completed Enemy Within on Classic difficulty in iron man mode so I’m no strategy game noob either. So hopefully I’ll pick up some tips during my easy run through and then give normal difficulty another shot. I do love the game, but I’m currently finding Darkest Dungeon more forgiving than XCOM 2! Crazy-Crusha (PSN ID) PS: I also love the disclaimer screen at the start of XCOM 2 stating that the video game is fictitious and does not represent actual world events… really? I’m shocked!   Online secret Is this a thing? My PS Plus membership ran out the other week and I’ve not gotten round to continuing my membership yet, as it seems more complicated since I have to say buongiorno for good morning where I now live. Anyway, just because I don’t have Plus at the moment, it seems my Black Ops III single-player save doesn’t work. Surely this is just on the PlayStation 4 hard drive and not related to having Plus? I know it can be played with people online, the single-player, but how is this a thing, to not be able to continue? £40 or more sterling I paid but I can’t carry on offline? If so, and it seems that way unless my one-year-old knows how to cancel saves, is more fuel to the ‘this gen sucks’ fire that I’ve been stoking as of late. Massive installs, terrible controller battery life, laughable initial hard drive space that’s nowhere near enough, which on PlayStation 3 was fine as it required only megabytes but now is always gigabytes. Bah! If it is a thing why no option to just continue the previous game with no online component? I don’t have the time to start from scratch you see. Silverfox-75 GC: Many games are essentially online-only now, although publishers never like to talk about. We’re not sure whether that’s specifically what going on here though, it could also be that the save was on the cloud.   E-mail your comments to: gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk   Lifted up I spent Sunday morning playing the new Hitman episode set in Colorado, it’s a much better instalment than Bangkok. With its mud, slurry, and survivalist fortifications Episode 5’s map is uglier than the Bangkok hotel but I found it more engaging. Possibly this is because the new level demands greater concentration. There’s no doubt that I found this mission the hardest yet. Episode 5 presents multiple targets and almost everyone seems to be carrying an air of hostility and an automatic weapon. I did manage to exploit a glitch in the artificial intelligence by neutralising 10 people with a car lift. Curiously the camp’s guards surrounded me and just looked on while I repeatedly squashed their comrades. I was gunned down as soon as I made a run for it though. Overall a good episode but with just two instalments to go I don’t think the developers are ever going to top Sapienza. Hitman’s adventure in Colorado gets 7/10 from me. msv858 (Twitter)   Family memories RE: Hot Topic. Initially, my choice was my favourite: The Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina Of Time because it’s my favourite. The upgrade from the previous adventure, with all the user-friendly new-fangled options and thought-provoking experiences, has been unparalleled since…! However, something else more worthy of mention is that back in the day when I played it, my children were younger and, at the time, lived with me and we shared the experience together. Those are memories I’ll fondly remember and hope to never forget…! Nostalgia is a very, very serious factor to be considered. While we are looking forward to the upcoming Breath Of The Wild, it seems from the various videos of gameplay I’ve seen this game will be a serious contender for my choice of favourite game (but only from a gameplay standpoint. However, unless we all four play it together, it will fall short of the affection I have for Ocarina Of Time. Bill Meylan   First time This weekend’s Hot Topic was an interesting one, as I am currently experiencing a few games for the first time. After a few false starts I finally finished Bioshock Infinite and I am currently restarting GTA IV after trying and failing many times to get past the first few hours of boredom. The problem with GTA IV is I don’t want to date or surf the Web. So the long tutorial and missions to show of the features just bored me. When I played GTA V I instantly fell in love with it. I’m three hours in and still yet to do anything interesting other than chase and kill. After GTA IV I have Deus Ex: Human Revolution to try for the first time. Anthony Daniels   Prime addition I’ve just found out via a Twitch stream (Happy Stupendous) that there is now Twitch Prime. You’ll just need to link your urgent account with your Amazon Prime account. It gives you various downloads for certain games, discounts on games, one subscription every month free, and ad free viewing. Might not mean a lot to a lot, but if you’ve already got an Amazon Prime account link your Twitch account and support your favourite streamer for free. Basin79   Remote play I suggest to other readers to checkout barebones and motherboard bundles available on the Internet. I also recommend DIY cloud gaming apps like remotr available on for game streaming from a home PC. As for graphics cards, it seems like AMD will win the DirectX 12 war. M.2 NVMe solid state hard disks are the latest standard as well.

There are diminishing returns though, so there is no need to spend too much. My overclocked PC ORAC is not only for gaming and so is specced for work use too, so it did cost a lot more.

We’ve sent creepyg81 one, so we’ve still got two to give out to whoever wants them.   This week’s Hot Topic The subject for this weekend’s Inbox was inspired by reader Ty Snowdon, and asks whether you collect and play retro video games? Assuming retro means anything from PlayStation 2 era on back, do you still buy and collect old consoles and games (emulated games don’t count)? And how much do you play them compared to modern titles? How serious are you about your collecting and how do you decide what to focus on? Do you buy imported American and Japanese consoles and games, or just stick to what was released in the UK? What’s the most expensive item you’ve collected and what lengths do you go to in order to play them authentically, in terms of peripherals and TVs?

But its latest realignment puts its reputation on the line. Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Oct 3, 2016 at 10:46AM Image source: IBM. Over a century old and recognized the world over, International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) is the quintessential blue-chip stock. Even its nickname, Big Blue, conjures images of the company's vaunted history among America's business elite. IBM's history contains far more wins than losses; a company couldn't exist for over a century otherwise. However, the current threats facing the company suggest that IBM's stock history is far more complex than it might seem. Here's a look at several important market metrics for IBM's stock: Company Name Ticker Symbol Market Cap P/E Ratio Dividend Yield International Business Machines Corp. NYSE: IBM $152 billion 12.7 3.6% Data source: Google Finance.  With the S&P 500 currently trading at a P/E of almost 25, investors should ask why IBM, which 26 sell-side analysts cover, trades at so significant a discount to the market. The answer speaks to a nuanced truth within IBM's stock history. Big Blue ascending IBM's corporate and investing history comes in several distinct phases -- not surprising for a company its age. International Business Machines traces its roots from the remnants of several companies dating to the 1880s. Business was conducted business under the name Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company, or CTR, until the current moniker came into use in 1924. Along the way, CTR hired a 40-year-old executive named Thomas J. Watson Sr. to help manage the company's rapid expansion. He ran the company from 1914 until his death in 1956. Under Watson, IBM pushed headlong into the market for tabulating machines just as the market exploded. During his tenure, IBM grew from a company with 1,346 employees and $9 million in sales in 1914  to 72,504 employees and $892 million in revenue in the year of his death. His son, Thomas J. Watson Jr., took the reins after his father's death. As the market for tabulation machines gave way to the computing revolution, Watson Jr. steered IBM's business toward mainframe computing, a move with immense benefits for the company. When Watson Jr. transitioned out of active management in 1971, IBM had grown to 258,662 employees and $7.2 billion in annual revenues.  The following years saw mainframe computing give way to personal computers, and IBM played a central role in the early part of the PC business. It first battled with the then-ascendant Apple and eventually lost the PC wars to the likes of Apple, Microsoft, Intel, Compaq, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, and others. Instead, IBM doubled down on enterprise IT services to great success, under the leadership of CEOs Louis Gerstner  and Sam Palmisano, Gerstner's protege. By the time Palmisano ceded leadership to current CEO Ginni Rometty in October 2012, the technology industry was in the midst of its current mobile-and-cloud renaissance and IBM found itself in another make-or-break transition period. That's where it still finds itself today. Image source: IBM. Can this elephant still dance?  IBM missed the boat on the ongoing revolutions in mobile and cloud computing, and it's been scrambling to adjust to the changing technology landscape ever since. Revenue has now declined in 17 consecutive quarters.  Its failure to foresee the structural changes in enterprise IT also helps explain why IBM stock has underperformed the S&P 500 by roughly 75% since Rometty became CEO. IBM data by YCharts But the blame lies with past leadership as much as with Rometty. A company as large as IBM takes years, not quarters, to reconfigure its revenue mix. Even so, some observers think the company has seemed too slow to respond. The good news is that some green shoots from Rometty's current plan may finally be emerging. Today, though sales and profit declines from its legacy businesses continue to place downward pressure on overall results, IBM has seen impressive growth in business segments it has dubbed as "strategic imperatives" -- cloud computing, artificial intelligence, data analytics, mobile, social, and security. Last year, strategic imperatives accounted for about 38% of IBM's total revenue, and the combined businesses continued to grow in Big Blue's most recent quarter, rising 12% year over year. IBM's stock is tantalizingly cheap at 12 times earnings, particularly for a company that has grown its dividends annually for 16 consecutive years. The company faces competition in many of the markets that make up its strategic imperatives -- Amazon.com dominates cloud computing, for example. However, given the company's immense financial resources and research prowess, it seems unlikely IBM will fade into irrelevance any time soon, making it an interesting option today for investors willing to hold IBM stock over the long term.

Mellanox Platform Support Coming In Linux 4.9 Written by Michael Larabel in Hardware on 3 October 2016 at 11:25 AM EDT. 7 Comments The x86/platform updates for the Linux 4.9 kernel that entered development on Sunday is bringing initial support for the Mellanox systems platform. Mellanox is a supplier of InfiniBand and Ethernet products for servers and storage. Mellanox products are widely-used in the high-end HPC market and data centers. The x86/platform code enables support for Mellanox Technologies platforms with support for hardware like their MSX6710, MSX8720, MSB7700, MSN2700, MSX1410, MSN2410, MSB7800, MSN2740, and MSN2100, among other products. This MLX_PLATFORM support was developed by Mellanox engineers and is now being mainlined in the Linux kernel after going through several rounds of revisions. It's great to see more companies working towards mainline kernel support. You probably won't find any of the hardware though in your closet or any bargain bins with the MSX6710 36-port switch costing $11.9k USD, the MSN2100 100GbE Open Ethernet Switch retailing for over $10k USD, etc. More details via the x86/platform pull request that also has SGI UV x86 and Intel MID updates. 7 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience. Michael has written more than 10,000 articles covering the state of Linux hardware support, Linux performance, graphics drivers, and other topics.

Wish I could be there :) Report comment Reply Mike Szczys says: October 3, 2016 at 12:16 pm I agree, amazing speakers! I saw all of the talk proposals and it was really hard to pick who would be invited to present. Thank you to everyone who submitted a proposal — sorry we couldn’t include everyone. On the other hand, with more and more of our live events we’ve been able to include a small number of speakers because we meet so many people through these proposals. I see that trend continuing!

The e-tail major has set up data centres in Mumbai and Chennai to manage traffic from its user base of 100 million-plus. The Indian e-commerce giant’s move to store its applications and data on its own servers comes at a time when global firms such as Microsoft, Google and Amazon look at India as the next battleground for providing cloud services. While most of Flipkart’s traffic comes from mobile users, other large firms have built their cloud services for Western enterprises and personal computers. “We have unleashed quite a bit of computing power for our system to scale up and that has been one big initiative that concluded just a month ago. On the back of that, we have re-deployed our services and have done a fair bit of performance optimisation,” said Ravi Garikipati, head of engineering at Flipkart. The roll-out of Flipkart’s own data centres came ahead of this year’s Big Billion Days sale that kicked off on October 2, as the company scrambled to beef up its tech platform to handle the immense traffic and order loads. In the first 12 hours of the sale itself, Flipkart and its fashion subsidiary Myntra said they received 2.25 million orders. Flipkart’s rival Amazon rents out storage and compute services to third parties to boost earnings from its under-utilised data centres. The concept later mushroomed into Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is today one of the biggest profit drivers for the US-based firm. Moreover, Flipkart providing its cloud computing solutions to third parties doesn’t seem that much of a long shot, given that the company has been opening up other parts, such as logistics, to external customers. The Indian firm’s logistics arm Ekart, which is largely the brainchild of Binny Bansal, handles orders from other players such as Jabong, Myntra, Voonik, Hopscotch, Reliance and Madhura, and also services consumers through a courier service. Flipkart has customised its data centres to suit its own technology stack. The firm sees millions of customers browse products on its platform each day, while the increasing number of products its sells also takes up a larger digital footprint. “We actually worked closely with our partner Intel to ensure they understand our application requirements, and then they along with our platform integrators defined our specifications. After that, we worked with OEM (original equipment manufacturers) vendors that built the hardware to our custom specification,” added Garikipati. Smaller rival Snapdeal recently launched its private cloud platform Cirrus, which it says is one of the largest open-source hybrid cloud deployments in the world. While the company has its in-house data centre, it continues to leverage AWS. The company did not reply to an email seeking clarification on whether it would open its service to outside clients. While Flipkart hasn’t indicated that it will begin offering its own cloud solutions to third parties, demand for cloud-based computing solutions has begun kicking off. This has created a mad scramble among leading cloud providers Microsoft, Google and Amazon to set up data centres in India. Amazon and Microsoft have data centres in India serving local customers, while Google plans to set up a data centre in Mumbai next year.

The new Pro chips, code-named Bristol Ridge, are for business desktops, and will appear in PCs from HP and Lenovo. The ability to easily upgrade is a big deal because it lets users avoid buying new PCs in order to get the Zen chips when they come out. It'll work like this: users buy a desktop with the new AMD Pro chip, but upgrade to Zen later on by replacing chips in the socket. There's a lot to like in the new AMD Pro chips, but there's even more excitement around Zen, which will provide a 40 percent improvement in CPU performance. The new AMD Pro will be compatible with the AM4 socket, which provides the basis for upgrades to Zen. AMD hasn't said exactly when the Zen-based successor to the 7th Generation Pro will be released, though various product roadmaps issued by the company suggest it could come out a year from now. That said, the upgrade ability offered by the 7th Generation Pro chips opens the door for PC purchases for Zen to start now. Enterprises want to keep PCs for as many years as possible, so the ability to easily upgrade to successor chips is important, said John Hampton, AMD's director of commercial business development. The 7th Generation Pro chips offer many advantages over their predecessors. The chips run 4K video and consume less power compared to predecessors, while boosting application performance. A 65-watt Pro chip consumes 32 percent less power than earlier generations of the AMD Pro, but speeds up CPU performance by 14 percent and graphics by 22 percent. The new lineup includes seven AMD A12, A10, A8 and A6 Pro chips. They will be used in HP's Elitedesk 705 G3 desktop, which will be available in tower PC and mini-desktop models. The chip will support Windows 10 and Linux OSes. Those who prefer Windows 7 may need to buy older AMD Pro chips, which the company will still sell. The 7th Generation Pro chips support DDR4 memory, NVMe SSD storage, USB 3.1, the USB Type-C slot and other new technologies. Hampton also highlighted an integrated "secure processor" that will secure the BIOS, firmware and personal data on a PC. The AMD Pro chips are also designed to work with Windows Hello for multifactor authentication and biometric logins for PCs. AMD's Pro chips are comparable to Intel's vPro chips, which are popular in business desktops. The Pro chips have remote management and security features based on the DASH (Desktop and Mobile Architecture for System Hardware) standard, which is widely used in servers. DASH shares many features with vPro, such as the ability to wipe out or shut down remote PCs that may have been stolen. But DASH isn't widely used yet, with Intel's vPro dominating the business PC market. The highest-performing quad-core Pro A12-9800 draws 65 watts of power and has a clock speed of 4.2GHz. It includes an eight-core Radeon R7 integrated GPU. AMD compares the chip to an Intel Core i5 Skylake chip. The lowest performing chip is the dual-core A6-9500E, which has a maximum frequency of 3.4GHz and draws 35 watts of power. It has a Radeon R5 GPU with four cores.

Not everyone can afford to splash out £1,000 on a computer, and Apple's cheapest Air laptops haven't been meaningfully updated in years. The Acer S13 starts at £549, making it the kind of machine that students and those a little more cash limited might buy. It's a bargain, with some elements that stand up pretty well to machines almost twice its asking price. There are a few compromises too, but they sit in the shade of this thing's sheer value-for-money factor. Acer Aspire S 13 review: Design Let's start with one of those compromises, though. Pocket-lint When you're on a budget you can choose to either make something look nice inside or on the outside. It applies to your house, your car and now your laptop. Acer has chosen to make the S13's insides look and feel great, leaving the bit passers-by will see looking more ordinary. Its lid is ridged soft-touch plastic, the underside plain soft-touch plastic. The silvery hinge gives the Acer S13 a touch of ultrabook-style, but even this is plastic. You can also get the laptop in a white and gold finish, but having seen them both in person (original hands-on images also in our gallery), we think 95 per cent of you will prefer the black version. Lift the lid and it's like a different laptop. The keyboard surround is a moody black brushed aluminium, while the trackpad is ringed with a bright bevelled line of metal - it's a classy look. You could easily believe the Acer S13 is a £1,000 laptop from a user point of view, but on the outside it's a bit more like a £500 one (which is fitting, given the price). Pocket-lint There are no similar compromises from a more practical perspective, though. The Acer S13 is slim and light; the perfect laptop if you want something portable that's also big enough to work on all day. It weighs 1.3kg and is 15mm thick. That's thinner and lighter than the 13-inch MacBook Pro. The various Asus ZenBook rivals look a bit nicer from the outside, but the Acer S13 has everything you need in a portable model. It's also well-made, especially given parts of the build are affected by the fairly modest budget. There's almost no keyboard flexing, no bowing of the frame if you pick it up by one end. Don't undervalue this solidity: a rigid keyboard is more important than a fancy-looking lid. Acer has also nailed the S13's connectivity, packing in a mix of old and new. You won't have to buy a bunch of new adapters for your current gear, but you also get one of the new USB-C 3.1 ports - that we frankly don't have all that much use for yet, but this will probably be indispensable in a year or two. Pocket-lint Older style connectors include two full-size USB 3.0 ports, a full-size HDMI and a full-fat SD card slot rather than the phone-centric microSD kind. This is a true mainstream crowd-pleaser array. You can plug the Acer S13 into a monitor or TV with a normal HDMI cable, and photography fans don't have to carry around an annoying card reader just to edit their pics. It's the polar opposite of a 12-inch MacBook, in other words. Acer Aspire S 13 review: Screen One part that's clearly better than some machines at the price is the screen. It's a 13.3-inch 1080p IPS screen with a matte finish, which kills reflections but can make the display look less punchy. We still see laptops not all that much cheaper using those poor TN-tech screens, so getting a pretty sharp IPS one in this Acer is a huge bonus. Pocket-lint Its contrast is good enough to watch films in a darkened room without the screen looking like a big grey box too. It makes a decent TV-replacer if you're a student or are the unfortunate one who took the box room in a flat share. Colour is vivid as well, but the tone is quite cold and slightly green-skewed. Acer could have calibrated the S13's display a bit better, but it's cracking hardware regardless. The Asus ZenBook UX310U is sharper still, but has worse contrast so isn't necessarily the outright winner if the two are pitched head-to-head. The S13's screen isn't a touch surface, but in return you get a laptop that shrugs at being used outdoors like it's no big deal. Its hinge also bends back quite far, which is handy if, say, you need to use the it while it's perched on your knees or, in real, the floor. Acer Aspire S 13 review: Keyboard and trackpad We are honestly surprised by just how good the keyboard is too. Like almost all slim laptops, its keys are shallow, but their action is of very high quality, with a real sense the feel has been carefully designed and optimised. Pocket-lint It's a joy to type on, and it even has a keyboard backlight - a feature that's still not guaranteed in mid-price style laptops like this. There are two levels of backlight intensity, a good extra if you like a subtler keyboard light. We can't be so nice about the trackpad, though. It's a bit annoying. The quality of the surface and the feel of the click mechanism are both very good, but its button layout is a bit of an ergonomic fail. It makes you accidentally press the right button frequently. There's no magic to this either. The Acer S13 trackpad is split down the middle - the right button "zone" takes up half the width of the pad and about an inch or two of its height. However, because the trackpad is shifted to the left of the frame (in a MacBook it's dead centre) your finger naturally strays towards the right side of the pad. Pocket-lint Time is the only solution. After a while you'll get used to the position, and naturally modify how you hold your hands. It is a pity the positioning isn't that bit smarter, though. Acer Aspire S 13 review: Performance and storage The other little compromise is one that affects just about all cheaper ultrabooks: the entry-level Acer S13 only has 128GB storage, because it's an all-SSD drive. There's no near-endless store for media, games and so on, and you'll probably have to prune your files every now and then. The higher-end version of the S13 have 256GB, though. It costs an extra £100 and also has a better Core i5 CPU. Having an SSD does transform a Windows machine though. We'd rather have a 128GB SSD than a 500GB hard drive. For day-to-day light use, the Acer S13's performance is largely indistinguishable from a top-end Core i7 machine, even though the variant we're using has an entry-level Core i3 CPU (the dual-core Intel i3-6100U CPU, clocked at 2.3GHz, paired with 8GB RAM). Pocket-lint For many of you, the difference between this and the pricier Core i5 won't be all that great, particularly as gaming performance is roughly similar to that of other Core-series CPUs. Don't expect recent games to run well, but those five-years-old or more should be playable if you fiddle with the graphics settings a bit. Skyrim runs fairly well on "low" graphics, for example. It doesn't run well with the visuals turned up, though. If you're going to be doing more demanding work, definitely consider paying the extra for the Core i5 version. However, for light work the Core i3 CPU is perfect. One of the Acer S13's few weak points is that under pressure, it lets out quite obvious higher-pitch fan noise. This is the downside of using a fairly small-diameter, high-revolution fan rather than a larger one that can afford to spin a bit slower. It may get on your nerves if you're sensitive about such things. The fan does its job, though. The S13 doesn't get unusually hot, or even particularly warm if you keep its duties light. It's completely silent a lot of the time too, the fan only kicking in as needed. Acer Aspire S 13 review: Battery life The S13 also lasts ages if you don't ask it to do anything too demanding. It can play 10 hours of video between charges, and should last through a full day's work. Its stamina is excellent. Pocket-lint We found that thanks to the good-quality matte display, you can use it at minimum brightness in a cafe without struggling, which is perhaps how you'd get it to last for Acer's claimed 11 hours. The Acer S13 also has loud speakers. They sit at each end of the laptop's underside, and pump out enough volume to make gaming or a bit of podcast-listening enjoyable enough. You can customise the tone a bit too, using a preinstalled Dolby EQ app. To start with the S13's treble was a little sharp, but switching to the Dynamic preset that alters the tone to suit whatever you're listening to improved matters. They're still laptop speakers, lacking any real bass depth, but are among the better ones out there. Their one issue is that they're very easy to partially block if you use the Acer S13 on your knees. Verdict The Acer S13 has no major flaws other than a trackpad that may well get on your nerves for the first week or so. It's otherwise a terrific laptops that has everything you need in a portable computer - and all for an affordable price. A good screen, a decent processor, great battery life and a super-slim, light frame are all major benefits - some of which are class-leading for the price. Add the decent connectivity, comfy keyboard and decent speakers, and you have a real mid-range winner. Not all of you are going to immediately fall in love with the textured plastic lid, but we'll leave whether that's enough to put you off a seriously versatile little laptop. Hate the look?

A Monday doesn’t seem particularly likely, and the ‘multiple sources’ cited are apparently just anonymous emails, but sometime around that date seems more likely than not. Logic dictates that a new OS update will be required for these new machines and if they were ready late September/early October, Apple would have added them to the September event. Additionally, Apple is known for its late October launches, having had one in October four of the past five years (skipping last year) and it wants to have its channel full of inventory for the runup to the holidays in November.  So October is a safe guess for upcoming products… IHS Securities – known for its cost-focused teardowns of Apple kit – also predicted recently that we’d be seeing a new 13-inch MacBook Air alongside the new MacBook Pro machines, supporting an earlier Bloomberg report suggesting a new iMac and 5k display (yes please!) at the same time. MacRumors also says that its ‘understanding’ is that ‘the company’s current development work on macOS 10.12.1 focused largely on preparing the operating system to support the updated hardware’s new features.’ Apple will of course need to ensure that macOS Sierra supports the two rumored hardware additions to the upcoming MacBook Pro range … We’re expecting the 2016 MacBook Pro to feature an OLED touchscreen in place of the physical function keys. Leaked images appear to show space for this bar, along with four USB-C ports. There appears to be support for my own theory that the touchscreen bar will be able to offer application-specific shortcuts as well as access to the universal controls currently offered by the function keys. The other significant new hardware feature we’re expecting is a Touch ID power button. This is likely to offer support for Apple Pay on the web, which currently requires handoff to an iPhone, as well as unlocking the Mac itself. We’ve already seen clues in macOS Sierra in terms of support for both features. We’re expecting the new machines to feature Intel Skylake processors, and an option for AMD’s Polaris GPUs. Apple has also been exploring the possibility of removing the headphone socket, but it seems unlikely it will do so this year, In terms of form-factor, the new MacBook Pro is pegged to have a smaller footprint and be thinner than existing models, but not to use the same wedge shape as the 12-inch MacBook and MacBook Air machines. We’ve seen a number of concepts showing how the new machines might look. I’m not expecting to get everything I want from the new machine, but will almost certainly bite the bullet and downgrade from my 17-inch beast to get the latest tech. What about you?

Our man tries to break TrueNAS DIY storage startup: Tech, check. Techies, check... Er, credibility? Rage-making, anxiety-inducing tech distributors: An ode Part Two You like the idea of “doing” a startup, but what about actually starting a startup? You can see the end point - success, hopefully - but what of the hoops and hurdles? In part one, I looked at funding, executives and staff. But now you’ve got the money and the people, what happens next? What about team composition and product? The subject of who should comprise your core team is a hotly debated one. It's worth pointing out that I'm just a Canadian nerd and I haven't gotten rich doing any startups. Other people who have actually played the game (and won!) disagree and their views should be considered. Jeff Ready, CEO of Scale Computing, offers the following thoughts: "On your original startup team of three, there is no sales person. Perhaps this is implied in your Gladhander, although you already have them doing quite a bit. I would take a salesperson over a tech marketer in that initial group all day long. One, because I can write the marketing stuff myself if I need to, but more importantly because customers are the key to the future funding." John Smith, (pseudonym I'm using in this series for the marketing director of the largest tech companies in the world) offers similar advice: "The biggest one is that I am not convinced of the criticality of the tech writer in the formative stages. In my experience, the key is the Kickass Developer and the Gladhander, the latter of whom serves as the tech writer early on. In order to keep things skinny, the Gladhander typically does the schmoozing and creates the messaging and similar related content for the investors while the Kickass Developer focuses on the plumbing." Here I feel I must poke my head in to these excellent comments. They aren't wrong: sales is absolutely critical. In fact, I view this as a key function of Gladhander: schmoozing those as need to be schmoozed and gladhanding the high rollers. I think a CEO who can talk Venture Capitalist, sell things and crack the whip over the employees is a much easier-to-find combination than a CEO who can talk Venture Capitalist and write decently. I've encountered plenty of CEOs who could sell snow to an Inuit. On the other hand, I literally wouldn't have a roof over my head if most CEOs (or marketing VPs) were intelligible at the keyboard. Converting CxO into human is my day job. An anonymous senior vice president at a one storage startup, who I will call John Johnson, had this to add: "There are almost always at least a couple developers. The other key to the early core of the company is you need people with cross-functional skills. Product manager / developers / content creation (slide decks are critical) / pitch person / business development (relationship person with the rolodex) / channel expert (most startups these days work with channel partners) skills all need to be included in that core team." Only the best of desks for the CEO Ugly babies Do not let Kickass Developer be CEO. Do not do. By this I am not advocating that CEOs can't be engineers or developers, but rather that the CEO can't be the lead developer of the product this startup is working on. The problem is that a huge part of the early life of a startup is seeking and incorporating feedback. Many experts I reached out to pointed out that they would seek out potential early customers before ever considering putting together money for a startup and this must continue for years if success is to be achieved. This process of engaging with customers will lead to changes in the design of the product. If the product is the CEO's baby, there's a problem. Nobody likes being told their baby is ugly and when the person in charge is emotionally invested in a specific solution, startups usually fail. Again, there are exceptions. Dheeraj Pandey, CEO of Nutanix explains, "I couldn’t relate to the Gladhander. As a CEO, I wrote a ton of code. Every partnership is different, you know. Just like a family – parents, siblings, etc, and making money is the last reason why people build sustainable companies. The biggest reason relates to the “right brain” – autonomy and an elusive desire to change the world." As one storage VP puts it: "the delicate balancing act of early startup life. Too much passion and there is an argument and a critical team member leaves. No enough passion and the plane flies into the side of the mountain. Too much debate and the product never ships. Not enough debate and the plane flies into the side of the mountain." With the who and how of starting our startup sorted, let's take a break from people and politics and dive into what the potential technology of our startup might look like. Tech 1.0 Before any of the funding or shenanigans above, you need an idea for a product. As we're designing a storage startup, I'll lay out a storage product. To design this product, I'm mooshing together ideas from dozens of storage startups alongside my own, so I'm sure lots of folks will see something of their own startup reflected in this design. In a perfect world we want to build a storage solution that meets all needs for all people. Everyone else will simply stop using the competition because ours is so awesome. Boiling the ocean, however, never works as a starting proposition, so we'll focus on one primary problem. NVMe is all the rage, and faster is typically better, so the core goal will be to build a storage product that goes really fast and takes advantage of what NVMe has to offer. NVMe is good for fast storage primarily because of high queue depth. Let's start with the new Intel Broadwell-based Xeon-Ds with integrated FPGA. Customize the FPGA for your high I/O workloads. This can help get around the part where NVMe is really, really CPU intensive. Get a NIC that can handle offloading without imploding in order to also drive CPU usage down. Pack it all into one of Supermicro's 48 drive NVMe chassis and slap your brand on it. As part of your sexy software you build a scale-out storage solution similar to Coho or Solidfire so that you can handle not only failure of the device, but failure of (at least) a node. Let's say it's object based and allows for n copies of an object. Qualify a good switch as part of the solution, one that can handle multicast really well. Use multicast for transmitting reconvergence data and other inter-node communications. This makes rebuilding of nodes easy and low-impact, even with huge NVMe setups. The rebuild stress ends up shared equally across the cluster, but the whole of the cluster doesn't have to play silly buggers trying to figure out who is doing what. The good switch is necessary because cheap switches are pants at multicast, and you're going to need every scrap of networking you can eke out. Build locality awareness into the storage platform and make sure any node can serve up storage. If you have a 32-node cluster, use 16 virtual IPs so that when you assign storage to a requestor they can not only manage to load balance requests across the whole of the cluster, but the cluster can make sure that the assigned storage has replicas physically on the nodes responding to the storage request. Most of this can be done by welding together various open source projects. As a 1.0 to prove viability to an angel investor that very well might be good enough, assuming you can demonstrate that you have identified pain points and have a solid roadmap for replacing some (or all) components by A round. You need something to patent, and the investor doesn't want to pay you to make a startup anyone can come along and clone. Be wary of other startups! As I discussed above, this design – like every storage startup – is taking elements from various existing companies' products*. Make sure you know who has patented what, and you work around that. Get Gladhander to earn their keep! Knowing what you want to build, however, is not enough. You need to be able to build it in stages, monetize it at different points, and have some idea of how you will handle investors, staff, partners, community and politics.

Ericsson’s patent pool is far from the new start the IoT needs EU chief promises modernised spectrum policy to avoid mistakes of LTE Analysis There are many interesting aspects to the announcement that Qualcomm, among others, is joining Ericsson’s Avanci patent pool scheme. Some of these appear contradictory. On the one hand, Avanci illustrates how the old patent structures of the mobile industry will no longer be fit for purpose for the Internet of Things (IoT). Closed, secretive systems which were stretched to breaking point by cheap handsets will be broken by billions of sensor modules and a wide range of industrial stakeholders. As if to ram home the point, Qualcomm, to whom patent pools are anathema, is to join this one. But if we were looking for a bright new dawn of open licensing deals and broad pools, we would be disappointed – after all, the companies behind Avanci are all traditional mobile players with significant patent portfolios to protect and monetize. Premier among them, Ericsson, was the instigator behind the system, which it launched as a then-unnamed patents marketplace in February. It launched a virtual licensing platform which it aims to establish as a dominant "independent" mechanism for coordinating IPR across many areas of IoT standards, as they relate to connected devices for vertical markets. This was positioned as a way to address the fragmentation of patent holdings which will exist across the many and varied IPR holders in the industrial IoT. Mobile players have had an arms-length approach to vertical markets in the past, building their cellular networks as generic platforms which would deliver voice and broadband to users in any sector, with no particular optimization for any (except in a few cases like GSM-R for railways). But in 5G, it is clear that the mobile broadband model will be running out of steam in terms of its increasingly challenging cost:revenue ratio, and operators and vendors will both look to closer relationships with vertical industries, particularly via the mobile IoT, to extend their business cases. This involves a bitter struggle to achieve pole position in a complex value chain. The operators’ have the best spectrum and their sup-pliers understand how to make a radio network behave, but the manufacturers, transport operators, auto makers, city authorities and so on also have powerful ecosystems and customer bases, and want to retain control of their service delivery, client relationships, branding and profits. One of the weapons in this battle to drive the IoT – epitomized by the tensions between Silicon Valley and Motor City in the connected car space – will be patents. However, the participation of Google and the web players, with their love of open source, and the sheer variety of IPR involved in the IoT, will make it impossible for any clique to achieve the closed-doors power of the current cellular industry patents system. So the companies which thrived in that world need to adapt their behaviour – before anyone else steals their thunder. Ericsson’s marketplace So there are all kinds of ironies about Ericsson, one of the bastions of the mobile industry’s traditional structure, setting itself up as the guardian of IoT licensing processes. But the firm increasingly wants to place itself at the centre of the IoT web, offering services and coordination between many different segments, and its licensing platform is just another example of that. Ericsson also doubtless sees the new organization as a useful channel to market for its own patents. Its system will license standardized technology for the industrial IoT to device manufacturers to encourage the growth of the ecosystem and reduce the risks for companies entering the space. There will be a revenue sharing model for those contributing patents, and those organizations will avoid the cost and complexity of managing their own licensing. There will be flat per-unit licensing fees for the verticals, designed to reflect how much of the connectivity technology a device uses, said Ericsson in the spring. Avanci is headed up by by Kasim Alfalahi, who left his role as Ericsson’s chief intellectual property officer to run the new platform. “We are initiating this marketplace following discussions with both wireless industry players and key players in industry verticals,” he said. So far, the vertical players are notable by their absence. The new supporters are Qualcomm and InterDigital, both stalwarts of the 3GPP standards and patents, plus ZTE, which has a growing presence in that area too, and Dutch operator KPN. Avanci’s aims, and Ericsson’s Avanci is now being a little more precise – and modest – about its near term aims. Its initial focus will be on the 2G, 3G, and 4G cellular patents surrounding connected cars and smart meters, before it expands into other IoT markets and verticals. Currently, it is not projecting any estimates of potential royalty levels, or what sort of revenue the pool might return to the IP holders. But despite the power of the new joiners, this remains firmly an Ericsson venture – five of the seven leadership team members are former Ericsson staffers. Ericsson, to be fair, isn’t being particularly coy about the purpose of Avanci for its business, noting that “this will be an additional go to market model for Ericsson, continuing to build on its IPR and Licensing business strategy to secure a fair return on its R&D investment”. The company’s IPR licensing accounted for SEK14.4bn (around $1.68bn) in 2015 revenues, a fraction of Ericsson’s total net sales of SEK246.9bn (around $28.8bn at today’s exchange rates, but nearer $30bn at the time) and its operating income of SEK 21.8bn ($2.54bn). However, back in 2011, the IPR figure stood at SEK 6.2bn ($720m), so it has effectively doubled IRP revenue in four years, at a time when its core businesses are under pressure. In a market of commoditization and tough competition, IPR, software, and services need to be Ericsson’s focus, and using the likes of Avanci to ensure that its patents remain integral to IoT deployments will help guarantee revenues, as well as influence over future platform directions. And if it can achieve a widely accepted single-licence solution to help companies navigate the legal minefield of IoT patents, continuing IPR power for the Swedish giant may be a small price to pay. The challenge of royalties in IoT But there’s the rub of course – to achieve its goals, the pool needs to attract a wide range of companies whose patented inventions are feeding into connected devices, not just the traditional makers of modems and surrounding cellular technologies. It has already been seen, in smartphones, that the falling prices of devices cannot sustain a system where every component has a separate royalty, and this will be even more true in the IoT. If Avanci is focused narrowly on 3GPP-type technologies, while GE, for instance, or Ford Motor has a separate patent pool for their area of the IPR land-scape, chaos will ensue, or at least a royalty burden which is impossible for makers of tiny modules priced at a few dollars or less. Avanci is somewhat vague about such issues for now. It says that it will support FRAND terms (fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory), of course, and that members can expect a transparent flat-rate process, with fees based on what value the patents bring to the technology at hand – though that, in itself, seems subject to contention and possible lawsuits in future. A graph on the Avanci website indicates that the fee will be based on the benefits of connectivity, the increasing mobility, and the amount of use, but the royalty rates have not been confirmed yet and may not be made public. Alfalahi said: “Since we began in April, we have received an overwhelmingly positive response from both IoT device manufacturers and patent owners to our streamlined licensing solution. With Avanci, something that would require time and resources to negotiate with many technology holders can now be done in one place, with one licence.” It will be interesting to see whether Nokia and Huawei join Ericsson and ZTE in an uneasy partnership over IoT patents (and other IoT big-hitters like Intel, MediaTek, Apple and so on). Recent history has shown that, despite the influence of Google and Apple over the mobile market, the 3GPP giants still derive huge power from their patents. Apple has been defeated by Nokia in patent battles and bruised by Ericsson. There is still no way to build a cellular de-vice and get around these companies, and insofar as the IoT will be cellular, that will remain true. But there are two flies in Ericsson’s ointment. Much of the IoT will not be mobile and therefore will often not require cellular, relying instead on fixed links or wireless in unlicensed spectrum. In these areas, different IPR systems and leaders prevail. China’s response will be crucial The other is China, where a great deal of IoT and 5G R&D is being conducted. It is encouraging that ZTE is supporting Avanci, but we can expect Chinese authorities, and its large ecosystem of device and chip vendors, to harness the IoT to try to rewrite the rules of a technology game which has traditionally left them over-reliant on western inventions and IPR. China and South Korea have been proposing antitrust policies which would require vendors to license their patents and technologies more openly and at lower cost, if they wish to trade in these two markets. Both are too important to ignore – China for its sheer size and the number of manufacturers and operators it houses; Korea for its advanced technology base and the weight of Samsung and LG. And where China goes, others follow, with Brazil and India said to be considering similar actions to reduce reliance on western companies’ technologies, and the licensing fees paid to them, while safeguarding against unfair business practices by major IPR players. In particular, Korea and China are introducing two important laws – set values for standards-essential patents (SEP), and the requirement that, if a unique feature (such as Apple’s slide-to-unlock) is considered “essential” or “dominant”, it must be licensed to others. Such stipulations could have a significant impact on how companies design IoT devices and license their technologies. And the more thorny the issues become in the cellular IoT, the more the unlicensed spectrum community, with its smaller base of patents (especially in low-power wide area networks) and more open approach, will have the opportunity to race ahead, attracting new vendors and deployers by offering far lower barriers to entry.

Privately held Palantir helps government agencies track down terrorists and uncover financial fraud. It raised $880 million in funding late last year, for a $20 billion valuation, and is considered one of Silicon Valley's most secretive companies. The lawsuit alleges Palantir routinely eliminated Asian applicants in the resume screening and telephone interview phases, even when they were as qualified as white applicants. Palantir denied the allegations in a statement and said it intends to "vigorously defend" against them. Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal Inc., stands on stage before the start of the Republican National Convention (RNC) in Cleveland, Ohio, U.S., on Tuesday, July 19, 2016. Andrew Harrer / Bloomberg via Getty Images Palantir was co-founded by Peter Thiel and Joe Lonsdale, two of Silicon Valley's more influential investors and entrepreneurs. A representative for Thiel could not immediately comment on the lawsuit. Ian Eliasoph, civil rights counsel for the Labor Department's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, said Palantir was randomly selected for a review, which examines the number of applicants for a given position compared with applicants' demographics. If signs of discrimination are found, the office opens an inquiry to search for violations. From 2010-2015 the compliance office conducted 20,918 compliance evaluations, 78 percent of which resulted in no violations. Some 22 percent had some violation and 2 percent had discrimination findings, according to the Government Accountability Office. In one example cited by the Labor Department, Palantir reviewed a pool of more than 130 qualified applicants for the role of engineering intern. About 73 percent of applicants were Asian. The lawsuit, which covers Palantir's conduct between January 2010 and the present, said the company hired 17 non-Asian applicants and four Asians. "The likelihood that this result occurred according to chance is approximately one in a billion," said the lawsuit, which was filed with the department's Office of Administrative Law Judges. However, Palantir said the Labor Department relied on a "narrow and flawed statistical analysis relating to three job descriptions from 2010 to 2011." Employment and civil rights attorney Cliff Palefsky said it was unusual to see hiring discrimination involving Asians. But Tracy Chou, of Silicon Valley-based diversity and inclusion organization Project Include, said discrimination against Asians for senior positions has been widely publicized. In 2015, Asians represented 27.2 percent of the professional workforce at Google, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, LinkedIn and Yahoo but were 13.9 percent of the companies' executive workforces, according to a study by pan-Asian professionals organization Ascend. "Asians are not perceived to be the same as whites even though in these diversity conversations Asians get lumped together with whites because they're overrepresented in tech compared to the overall population," she said. Since January 2010, Palantir has been a party to federal government contracts worth over $340 million, the lawsuit said. The Labor Department sent Palantir a notice in October 2015 about its findings, according to the lawsuit. Both before and after that notice, labor regulators attempted to secure Palantir's voluntary compliance, the lawsuit said, but they did not succeed. The lawsuit seeks relief for persons affected, including lost wages. Follow NBC OUT on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 2, 2016 at 11:30AM Image source: NVIDIA.  On Sept. 28, graphics specialist NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) unveiled an interesting new chip code-named Xavier at its GPU Technology Conference event in Europe. The new chip, the company says, is "designed for use in self-driving cars." The chip itself integrates eight NVIDIA-designed 64-bit ARM cores, a 512-core graphics processor based on the company's upcoming Volta graphics architecture, two video processors capable of handling 8K video, and a specialized computer vision accelerator. It's manufactured in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's 16-nanometer technology and is made up of a whopping seven billion transistors. more than twice as many as what Apple's A9X processor includes. The company says it will begin sampling to customers in the fourth quarter of 2017 with "automakers, tier 1 suppliers, start-ups, and research institutions who are developing self-driving cars." This chip is a big deal for NVIDIA -- here's why. Drive PX 2 performance at a fraction of the power (and probably cost) Earlier this year, NVIDIA announced a platform dubbed the Drive PX 2 targeted at self-driving cars. Drive PX 2 includes two of NVIDIA's recently announced processor code-named Parker, as well as two standalone graphics processors based on the company's Pascal architecture. Drive PX 2 is quite powerful, but it also consumes 250 watts and needs to be liquid-cooled. According to NVIDIA, the upcoming Xavier chip "will be able to replace today's DRIVE PX 2 configured with dual mobile SoCs and dual discrete [graphics processing units] -- at a fraction of the power consumption." Image source: NVIDIA.  The much-improved power efficiency of this single-chip solution is, in itself, a big deal. Putting what required multiple large, liquid-cooled chips mounted on a fairly large logic board onto a single chip should enable future DRIVE PX platforms to be delivered in much more compact form factors. Perhaps what's even more interesting, though, is that NVIDIA should be able to realize a significant cost reduction from this solution as well. The current DRIVE PX 2 platform requires no fewer than four large NVIDIA chips -- two Tegra and two standalone graphics processors. That's a lot of chip content, which probably means the DRIVE PX 2 is fairly expensive to produce. By consolidating all of that functionality into a single chip, the manufacturing cost of the silicon that NVIDIA includes in future DRIVE PX platforms should come down substantially. I suspect that NVIDIA will use the reduced production costs to lower prices somewhat, making the solution more accessible and potentially driving more volume, but at the same time, I don't think it will pass all of those savings on to potential customers. This approach should allow NVIDIA to boost the gross profit margins that it enjoys from future DRIVE PX platforms. NVIDIA is quite serious about self-driving cars NVIDIA's initial efforts in the automotive space were largely targeted at in-vehicle infotainment applications. Those applications generally don't carry high gross profit margins as there are a lot of companies out there (essentially any major mobile system-on-chip players) that could conceivably repurpose their chips as in-vehicle infotainment chips. Indeed, many of them -- including Qualcomm, Intel,  Texas Instruments, and others -- already do just that. However, what NVIDIA seems to be doing here is unique. The company's automotive efforts are transforming from an attempt to repurpose mobile processors and gaming-oriented graphics processors for self-driving cars to a full-on effort to produce platforms, both hardware and software, tailored specifically for the nascent market. To be clear, though, this is a gamble. If the market for self-driving cars really takes off, then the platform investments NVIDIA is making here could have a very large payoff. If it ultimately fizzles out, then NVIDIA will have invested a lot of research and development dollars for naught. That said, given that NVIDIA's business is currently doing extremely well, it makes sense for the graphics specialist to strike while the iron is hot and go after some of these opportunities, particularly as products targeted toward those segments can leverage so much of the work that is done for its core businesses anyway.

Protesters in Ha Tinh province vented their anger at Formosa Ha Tinh Steel, which has offered $500 million in damages and admitted that its $10.6 billion steel plant was responsible for massive fish deaths along a 200-km (124-mile) stretch of coastline in April. The protest started early Sunday and finished around noon, with police in helmets and shields deployed to guard the compound. The police left as the number of protesters, estimated at about 10,000 people, outnumbered them, protestor Tran Viet Hoa said by phone. Images posted by demonstrators on social media matched the description. There were no injuries or arrests reported. Some demonstrators climbed a front gate reinforced from inside by fire trucks and other vehicles, but they were not able to get in, Hoa said. Others entered from a back gate and smashed some windows and cameras. Formosa in Taiwan could not be reached for comment and an official responsible for external relations at its Ha Tinh unit said he was not aware of the situation and would respond later. Police and the provincial authority, the Ha Tinh's People Committee, could not be reached for comments. The Vietnamese government has offered favorable conditions to attract foreign investment, with companies such as Samsung Electronics and Intel key drivers of the economy and sources of jobs. Formosa is one of its biggest investors and protests against the firm took place in Vietnam's biggest cities over several weekends since April. In some cases, police used excessive force to thwart them, rights groups say. Another witness said people were angry because they encountered resistance from police while trying to peacefully assemble. "People were irritated because they just want to meet Formosa directly and negotiate," said the witness, who declined to be named. Demonstrators were demanding Formosa close the steel plant and give more compensation and do a better environmental cleanup. They wanted the government to stop an alternative plan of discharging the waste into a local river instead of into the sea for better monitoring, the witness said. Taiwan's Foreign Ministry in a statement said its representatives in Vietnam had contacted the steel plant, which police had shut down temporarily. "The representative office has asked Vietnamese authorities to send more police to protect the plant, its employees, and the lives and property of all Taiwanese businessmen in Ha Tinh province," it said.

Anytime. Anywhere. NEWS OPS By Jef Cozza. Updated October 3, 2016 11:13AM SHARE ALSO SEE AMD Chips & Processors Bristol Ridge APU Hewlett Packard Lenovo Enterprise IT Desktop PCs Technology News AMD is hoping that the latest generation of AMD PRO processors will help it gain a bigger foothold in the enterprise desktop market. The new series of PRO APUs (accelerated processing units), announced at the Canalys Channels Forum in Barcelona today, is the seventh generation of the processor. The new models promise to deliver increased computing power and graphics performance, along with improved security and energy efficiency. The PRO, according to AMD's pitch, stands performance, reliability, and opportunity. Lenovo and HP have already signed on to produce enterprise desktops featuring the new chips, while AMD said it expects to see more manufacturers jump onboard in the future. HP said the PRO APUs will be featured in its EliteDesk 705 G3 desktop series, touting their ability to provide the added performance, security, and flexibility that enterprise customers need, without added IT complexity. The new systems also provide fully support for Microsoft Windows 10 Pro features including Device Guard, Windows Hello, Biometric Security, and BitLocker Encryption. Hardware-Based Security AMD has been making a renewed push for enterprise clients over the last year. In January, it finally rolled out "Seattle," the code name for its long-awaited 64-bit ARM chip designed for the data center. The PRO series, which had been going under the nickname "Bristol Ridge," is likewise geared toward enterprise clients. AMD says the new chip is focused on three key areas likely to appeal to enterprise users: increased security, better computing and graphics capabilities, and a more open standard that is easier to integrate with other systems. Businesses will likely be looking most carefully at the PRO series' security features, given the increased threat of network intrusion companies are facing today. The AMD Secure Processor, one of the PRO features the company is hyping, is a dedicated processor that forms the core of a hardware-based security solution. The Secure Processor provides a trusted execution environment for trusted third-party applications, allowing systems to boot up securely directly from the BIOS. The trusted execution environment partitions the CPU into two virtual "worlds." Sensitive tasks are run on the AMD Secure Processor, the secure world, while other tasks are run in the "standard operation" area. "This helps ensure the secure storage and processing of sensitive data and trusted applications. It also helps protect the integrity and confidentiality of key resources, such as the user interface and service provider assets,' the company said. Faster, Better Graphics, and More Efficient Increased performance, particularly in graphics, is the PRO line’s second major selling point. AMD says the new processors provide up to 14 percent more computing power and 22 percent better graphics performance while being up to 32 percent more energy efficient than the previous generation of AMD PRO processors. The company is also touting Bristol Ridge's increased flexibility over previous generations, thanks to its use of DASH architecture standard. According to the company, the CPU-agnostic DASH standard should make the new processor line more flexible, upgradable, and stable when integrating with other processors on a network. The PRO series has been helping AMD in its decades-long competition with Intel, and the company has high hopes for its 7th-generation version continuing success in the enterprise market. "In the past two years we made incredible progress in the commercial client segment," said Jim Anderson, general manager of AMD's Computing and Graphics Business, noting that AMD PRO processor unit shipments increased more than 45 percent since its inception in mid-2014.

We've been sitting at a wall for a while now on gigabit ethernet, because 10GbE requires much more expensive cables in the form of fiber optic, or more expensive Cat6a or Cat7 cabling. It's not backwards compatible with previous standards, as well as routers, switches, and network cards for 10GbE networking being much more expensive than the normal GbE products.   This is where the new 2.5GBASE-T and 5GBASE-T standards step up, both "specifically created to use 10GbE signaling, but at a rate that would be compatible with existing runs of Cat5e and Cat6 cable out to 100 meters. The 2.5Gbps standard can run on Cat5e out to 100 meters, while the 5Gbps standard requires Cat6 cable to run 100 meters. Both should be far easier - and cheaper - to bring to market than current 10GbE technologies", reports ExtremeTech.   Now we need to see AMD and Intel bringing out chipsets in the near future with 2.5/5GBASE-T compatibility, so that our SSDs that push 500MB/sec can now do it over our networks.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Oct 2, 2016 at 3:11PM Many growth investors like tech stocks because they occasionally generate market-crushing gains within just a few years. Over the past decade, e-commerce giant Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)rallied nearly 2,500%, while Baidu -- the biggest search engine in China -- surged nearly 2,000%. Image source: Pixabay. Those gains look explosive, but many other tech stocks also bombed during those 10 years. Therefore, investors who are interested in this sector should remember five simple tips before buying their first tech stocks. 1. Understand what the company does The tech sector is filled with companies that promote "hot" technologies. However, investors often buy shares of these companies on an analyst recommendation without really understanding what they sell. As Warren Buffett famously said, "Never invest in a business you cannot understand." That's why Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is such a popular tech stock among both mainstream and institutional investors. Its business is easy to understand -- most of its revenue comes from its three hardware product lines (iPhone, iPad, Mac), but it's gradually pivoting toward paid services (Apple Pay, Apple Music, Apple Care) to reduce its dependence on hardware. Other companies have hidden strengths. Amazon is generally known as an e-commerce site, but its most profitable business is actually AWS (Amazon Web Services), the largest cloud platform in the world. The profits from that business offset the much lower margins at its marketplace business. 2. Look for market leaders When I invest in tech stocks, I generally look for "best-in-breed" market leaders. These leaders usually have strong pricing power, stable margins, and the ability to exploit economies of scale and bundling strategies to marginalize smaller rivals. Amazon exhibits all these qualities in both the e-commerce and cloud markets. Cisco has the same strengths in the networking equipment market, while Salesforce has similar advantages in the cloud-based customer relationship management market. 3. Always look forward The worst mistake a tech company can make is falling behind the tech curve. Yet larger tech companies often fall behind because they focus more on quarterly growth, dividends, or buybacks than boosting their research and development budgets. Market leaders, their egos boosted by temporary glory, also sometimes prematurely dismiss disruptive threats. Image source: Pixabay. That's precisely what happened to BlackBerry (NASDAQ:BBRY), which controlled a fifth of the smartphone market seven years ago. After its market share plunged to nearly 0%, it decided to stop producing its own smartphones in late September. The same can be said about Intel, which surrendered the mobile chip market to Softbank's ARM Holdings' licensees, and Microsoft, which ceded the mobile OS market to Apple and Alphabet's Google. If a tech company stops innovating and simply follows market trends, its high growth days might be over. That's what might be happening with Apple, which is pursuing "hot" markets like smartwatches and streaming music instead of launching new game-changing devices like the iPod and iPhone. 4. Understand the valuations Investors often pay big premiums for high-growth tech stocks, but these stocks can be solid investments if their valuations are supported by comparable earnings growth. Amazon, for example, trades at 79 times forward earnings, but is expected to deliver earnings growth of 80% next year.  However, these valuations can be tricky if a company posts explosive sales growth with widening losses. In these cases, investors should check the company's cash position and free cash flow to better analyze the health of the business. 5. Don't ignore "old tech" Many investors focus on the sexy high-growth tech stocks, but they should remember that slow growers like Cisco, Microsoft, Intel, and IBM are still great sources of stable income. These companies also buy back lots of stock, regularly raise their dividends, and trade at much lower multiples than higher-flying tech darlings -- making them ideal core holdings for your portfolio. The key takeaway The tech sector might seem overwhelming at first, but it all comes down to buying what you understand, identifying the market leaders and disruptors, and understanding their valuations. Investors who tick off these boxes while doing their due diligence might find some solid tech stocks to hold for the long run.

But, the increasingly more amusing part of this new found accuracy is emulating game crashes. When using MMU Enabled + Single Core, it should be impossible for a game to crash Dolphin, but, much more likely to emulate a game crashing in situations where it would on console. As such, booting all games is old news, Dolphin is now onto emulating crashes in all games. One infamous one that didn't work in Dolphin is known as the Gotcha Force "Force 20" game glitch. Gotcha Force "Force 20" Crash Though not specially highlighted this month, our applause has to go to aldelero5 for continuing to work on and renovate Dolphin's debugger. With Dolphin's increasingly accurate MMU emulation, it's actually become even more useful to poke at and prod games. They are making it so much easier to research and prod bugs like this to delve even deeper into the game logic! While that was merged near the beginning of the month, we had another major change merged at the end of the month. Two hours before the progress report was originally scheduled. Dolphin now has another experimental backend, this time using the Vulkan API. Much like D3D12, it should be considered experimental, with a few features still missing from the backend, and many drivers having their own issues with Vulkan. With that out of the way, let's get onto this month's notable changes! Notable Changes¶ 5.0-540 - Dynamic BATs by magumagu¶ Click here for the full article. If you couldn't tell by the introduction, this is still a pretty big deal. Dolphin is capable of booting every single GameCube game now, and the only two games that don't get in-game are Phantasy Star Online 1&2 Trial Edition and the Game Boy Player. Both require emulating new hardware addons for Dolphin to boot them, and the Game Boy Player is an entirely different system! Fortunately there is already a great emulator out there which may take up the task. Because we already had an absolutely huge article on it, there isn't much else to say. In summary, better Memory Management Unit emulation gets Star Wars: The Clone Wars to boot while fixing a gaggle of other bugs. Instead, let's focus on the impact and reports we've gotten from users, as well as some trends we've noticed over the past four weeks since it's been merged. Reports of Broken Games: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was reported as broken by this change. We investigated and found that this game is a bit of a special case. It only runs in Dolphin's JIT! The seemingly more accurate Interpreter, Cached interpreter and less accurate JITIL all immediately crash on boot! We tested the game before and after Dynamic BATs. There is no regression. Performance Issues: Some users have reported anywhere from a 16% to 33% slowdown on certain configurations, but when it comes to reproducing these slowdowns, no one on the staff can actually see a major slowdown in non-MMU titles. If you're seeing slowdowns since Dynamic BATs in non-MMU titles, try to hang in there; there's still more optimization that can be done on CPU emulation and any slow down should be possible to counteract. It's just identifying what (if anything,) is slower right now. JITIL Issues: We broke JITIL again. There is no reason to be concerned, this is par for the course. We break JITIL all the time. Anyway, enable MMU + JITIL will cause Dolphin to lockup on game boot. We recommend you do not do this. Unless you really need to see that we're not joking. The question is whether we do the work to fix JITIL or simply remove it. With JIT issues becoming less and less common, JITIL is becoming less and less useful to keep around. Also Cached Interpreter replaces some of its usefulness as a comparison to the JIT that isn't super slow. 5.0-546 - [IPC HLE] Implement /dev/usb/ven with very basic functionality by Jhonn¶ While Dolphin still doesn't support USB Microphones, there are actually a couple of games that check for the USB Microphone without actually requiring it, such as the newer Just Dance titles. Since Dolphin didn't even have basic USB emulation, when the game checked for a USB microphone, it would just crash before it even finished booting. So in order to get the non-Microphone portions of the game to work, some very basic functionality of USB Microphone detection needed to be added. Dolphin now properly fails the game's USB check, allowing the game to boot. This fix allows the Just Dance 2014, 2015, 2016, and likely the upcoming Just Dance 2017 to boot. At this point we wouldn't surprised to see a Just Dance 2018 announced. 5.0-560 - Remove instant ARAM DMA hack by phire¶ A while ago on the Progress Report, we alluded to the fact that Dolphin's Auxilliary RAM Direct Access Memory (ARAM-DMA) timings suddenly become different when Resident Evil 2 or Resident Evil 3 are being played. At the time, we said we were ~99% sure that the GameCube's DMA timings wouldn't become instant when playing Resident Evil 2 or 3, and now we are 100% sure. The last known full GameCube "game" that wasn't reaching gameplay in Dolphin after Dynamic BATs was Army Men: Sarge's War. When doing more research into why Army Men was broken, phire realized it was hitting the ARAM-DMA hack that was designed to fix Resident Evil 2 and 3. See, the ARAM-DMA hack wasn't just activating in Resident Evil 2 and 3. Instead, Dolphin looked for cases where L1/L2 cache invalidation was happening during a Direct Memory Access transfer. When this happened, Dolphin went into instant ARAM-DMA mode to try and curb any issues caused not emulating the L1/L2 CPU cache. In the cases of Resident Evil 2 and 3, they use their own custom streaming audio setup. Developers currently disagree with what is actually going wrong at the current state; but, L1/L2 cache emulation is likely needed for things to work properly. The music never correctly loads in areas with two "music" tracks. Instead of leaving a big ARAM-DMA hack just for Resident Evil 2 and 3, we decided to break the music in the games and remove the hack altogether. The games are still fully playable, but areas with multiple music tracks will have issues with the music cutting in and out as they constantly fight to play each area. Often, ambience and other reoccuring sound effects are used as a second "music" track, so don't be surprised if the music is missing in a lot of areas. This change fixes Army Men: Sarge's War and likely other games inadvertently activating the ARAM-DMA hack. Before anyone asks, yes, Dolphin could have activated the hack only for Resident Evil 2 and 3. The reason that was not done was because we really want to fix this properly. So many times in the past, a developer has left a hack in Dolphin that has come back to cause issues when accuracy is increased. Sarge's War is just one of those casualties, but there have actually been dozens of titles broken by assumptions made by old hacks; some of which extended the feature freeze before 5.0 by quite some time as regressions from finally removing them were sorted out. We will fix Resident Evil 2 and 3 eventually, and this time it won't be with a hack. 5.0-568 - PixelShaderGen: Always divide the texture coordinates by q by Armada¶ This one fixes one of our favorite bugs in all of Dolphin. There's a bug in Fishing Resort, where the player pulls out the map, but, for some reason, the map is actually upside down. Among developers, we've joked quite a bit about the character being an idiot and simply holding the map upside down! Yet, we knew there was a real issue, and a lot of attempts to fix it have already failed. Finally, Armada pulled off the seemingly impossible when looking at ornox's Texture Coordinates Q == 0 fix featured in last month's Progress Report. He realized there were other cases where texture coordinates weren't being divided by q. Fishing Resort Map Bug 2009 - 2016 The laughter you gave us will never be forgotten. Also this fixes Find Mii's dark stages, but, that's not nearly as amusing. Now that's one way to make the game harder. Ahh that's better. Note: this was discovered by fifoci, hence the missing faces. Fifologs don't record EFB Copies generated before the fifolog. Note: An earlier version of this entry referenced a different change. The writer responsible has been flogged. 5.0-643, 5.0-647, and 5.0-726 - Android UI Improvements by SeannyM¶ Well, it's been a while. Dolphin Android hasn't been seeing many unique updates since outside of a few components, it's internally the same thing as the PC versions. But SeannyM has stepped up to the plate and has committed a ton of fixes for Android! These are all well needed fixes, so let's ignore the specific commits and just go through the fixes one at a time. Scale buttons based on screen dimension¶ Dolphin now scales the on-screen buttons based on your screen dimensions. This helps smaller phones and of course, portrait mode! As if the GameCube controller's A button wasn't big enough already... Now that's much more sensible. Improved Button Scaling¶ This little change scales all of the buttons relative to each other based on real world measurements. There are some differences from world sizes here and there for usability, but it makes the on-screen controls much more familiar. For a before shot, just compare this to the scale buttons images above. C-Stick and Dpad Support¶ Dolphin now has on-screen controls for the GameCube Dpad and C-stick! You can finally spam downsmash as Peach in Melee and then taunt after yet another kill! Android: fix save and load state menus on non-TV devices¶ This fix restores a very important bit of functionality that is especially important for mobile users - the ability to save and load savestates on demand. Previously, the save and load state menus would try to load the Android TV UI fragments regardless of the device it was currently running on. On non-Android TV devices, such as phones, this resulted in a crash because the layout doesn't exist on that device. With this addressed, manually saving and loading savestates works properly once again! Toggleable buttons UI¶ Next up, there is now a configuration menu that allows you to toggle on-screen buttons as you please. This very simple change makes it simpler to use what you need for a game; for much cleaner, easier to use on-screen controls. The toggle menu lets you select which controls you want on-screen. If you are playing a game that uses next to no buttons, you can just use what it needs! Wait wait, those weren't GameCube controls in the toggle menu! Wiimote on-screen buttons¶ That's right, Dolphin on Android now has Wiimote touch controls! For the first time you can control a Wii game with nothing but your screen. It's still limited though, as only the Wiimote and Nunchuk are available, and there are no motion controls or pointer, but this is a big step toward Android compatibility for on-screen users. Oh yea, time for some Xenoblade on the road! ...at 4fps... With all of these changes, on-screen controls for Android have taken a huge leap forward! However, there are still considerable issues left. The buttons do not indicate when they are pressed, joysticks do not slide about in their range, the classic controller pro has not been implemented, and motion controls will be a nightmare. But thanks to SeannyM, we're slowly moving toward a complete touch control interface. 5.0-730 - LogicOp/DestinationAlpha Hack for OpenGL by stenzek¶ OpenGL cannot emulate Kirby's Return to Dream Land's shadows without this hack. For quite a while Dolphin has been attempting to move on from the two pass method it uses when dual-source blending is not supported, and things were getting close with most graphics cards now supporting it as a basic feature. Destination alpha is emulated by writing two colors from the fragment shader. The first contains the alpha value that is written to the framebuffer, and the second contains the value passed into the blending equation to determine the final color of the pixel. Unfortunately logical operations cannot be combined with blending, and cannot be applied on a per-channel basis, meaning that the two-pass fallback was needed to write the constant alpha value to the framebuffer. The only known case where this causes an issue is Kirby's Return to Dream Land. This is far from a perfect solution, due to it not being accurate in all cases, but it does make Kirby's shadow only appear on the ground as expected. Why did we finally cave and add the hack? Vulkan, D3D12 and Metal, the three new APIs, all lack the functionality Dolphin needs. So, instead of waiting any longer, stenzek implemented the hack and degasus approved it. After realizing help was not on the way, it was either leave it broken forever or implement a hackfix. Oh no, Kirby is being eaten by a black ink blob! It's Vietnam all over again! Thankfully Kirby will suffer no more war flashbacks with this fix. For those of you on D3D11/12... this fix isn't coming your way. Now, you probably are thinking, "Hey, Kirby's Return to Dreamland's shadows already works on D3D," and you'd be correct. It does work. The output of the broken implementation there lines up with what appears on console. On the other hand, lack of LogicOp support altogether does cause other issues. The most well known example is F-Zero GX in Story Mission 2. The shadows of these boulders don't appear on D3D. But they appear perfectly fine in OpenGL. With D3D12, there is the possibility of supporting F-Zero GX's boulder shadows in the future. On the other hand, D3D11 completely lacks any functionality toward it. 5.0-748 - Vulkan Backend by stenzek¶ Stenzek implemented a backend that uses some weird graphics API a few people seem to like. There's actually a lot to say, but this got merged the night of the progress report (literally two hours before October 1st.) So in honor of the devs who have absolutely no regard for the blog staff, prepare for the ultimate technique for blog article writing: winging it. Vulkan for AMD Users¶ The biggest news for us with Vulkan is that they will finally bring AMD graphics cards up to speed on a non-D3D backend. Linux users with AMD graphics have had it pretty rough in Dolphin, seeing much, much worse performance compared to similar hardware from other vendors. Vulkan finally levels the playing field, giving absolutely huge boosts to AMD users. AMD users on Linux can finally celebrate reasonable performance! Once Vulkan is feature complete, there won't be much purpose for AMD graphics users to ever go back to OpenGL in Dolphin. With an AMD APU, Vulkan shows that it can stand toe to toe with D3D11/12 in performance. This means our Linux AMD GPU users... well, before this point there was no point in trying Dolphin on that configuration. Now those users can get comparable performance to D3D11/12 on Windows without having to install Windows. Unfortunately for our Mac OS users, to our best knowledge they do not plan to support Vulkan. Vulkan for NVIDIA Users¶ NVIDIA users have the opposite problem. The OpenGL drivers are so fast that it's fairly difficult to find games that perform all that differently inVulkan than OpenGL. Twilight Princess is one of those exceptions. Much like D3D12, Vulkan greatly outperforms D3D11 and OpenGL when taking away the Twilight Princess speedhack provided by the emulator. NVIDIA users really have no reason to use Vulkan outside of the few rare cases where its efficiency really shines. Once it's feature complete and has some optimizations, this can change very fast. Note: NVIDIA's drivers are broken on Vulkan for Dualsource Blend. Dolphin uses this quite a bit, so, if you're planning on using the Vulkan backend on your NVIDIA cards, you'll need 368.81 or older on Windows or 367.44 or older on Linux. We'll plan on sending in some test cases so the drivers can be fixed. Again, OpenGL performs fairly similar for these users, so it shouldn't be considered too urgent. EDIT: This issue was fixed by 375.63. Vulkan on Android¶ Mobile users have been itching for Vulkan to give sweet sweet performance gains! Yeah, not happening yet. Mali crashes immediately on start, and it doesn't give any reason why. Adreno at least renders something, but it's completely wrong even on many test programs and Dolphin isn't close to playable. We haven't tested all the other mobile drivers yet, but so far it appears they have similar problems. On Android, Vulkan driver support just isn't ready yet. Vulkan on Intel using Mesa¶ For right now, Vulkan is slower than OpenGL on Intel Mesa due to several hardware features being left unimplemented. This should change in the near future as it's brought closer to completion. General Information about Vulkan Support¶ Vulkan support is finally here! So, what does it mean? Well, both Vulkan and D3D12's greatest strengths simply don't apply to most emulators. That means that we aren't going to see world changing performance boosts simply by implementing the API. Instead, we'll be looking at various optimizations that use Vulkan's unique abilities to help emulate games with quirks that are particularly demanding. Where Vulkan does shine, it really is great. Being able to play Twilight Princess without a specialized speedhack is a result of the newer APIs simply being more efficient, and there will likely be more cases where we can gain added accuracy without a cost to speed. But, that will come with time. On that note, while the Vulkan backend is very stable, it's not quite complete. The most notable missing feature is External FrameBuffer (XFB) support, which is because we're currently in the process of rewriting support. It felt a bit wasteful to greatly complicate the Vulkan backend for something that was going to get renovated soon anyway. Also, Vulkan lacking XFB support just means we can bug the developer behind it (phire) to work harder because our AMD Linux users are suffering greatly while he does things that aren't HybridXFB. The other missing feature is actually missing from Vulkan altogether: exclusive fullscreen. We're hopeful that extensions in the near future will rectify that, but, it's something to keep in mind for now. Unlike D3D12, we don't consider Vulkan to be quite as "experimental." It shouldn't randomly crash, it doesn't have any egregious hacks in the backend, and we have stenzek here to maintain it. There may still be occassional bugs, and, do remember titles that require XFB will not work for now. Other than that, have fun with it and see how it stacks up with our other backends. It should be a solid alternative to D3D12 for AMD users, and definitely has the potential to go further than OpenGL longterm! If you find any issues with the Vulkan Backend, please report them, we currently have a developer actively working on it so it's likely there will be a quick turn-around on issues!

They look the same, and offer similar (but not necessarily compatible) products, but they have in essence been in competition, to put it mildly. Arduino Srl represents Arduino co-founder Gianluca Martino's unilateral break from the original group of five founders, while the LLC is the primary licensor of the Arduino brand. It's been an ugly rift, but according to an announcement posted yesterday at Arduino.cc (the website of Arduino, LLC) and delivered in-person at the New York Maker Faire, it should now be behind us. A new unified entity called Arduino Holding will handle physical products, while another new entity, the Arduino Foundation, will continue to develop the open-source Arduino IDE. Some background: For many, Arduino is synonymous with DIY hardware hacking. It's not unearned: Hobbyists have been tinkering with microcontrollers forever, but the Arduino platform offered (and still offers) tools that allow pretty much anyone to start programming LEDs, robots, and lots and lots of backyard weather stations just out of the box. For some, it's a jumping off point into the deeper world of embedded and real-time systems, while for others it's an end in itself. As such, it mirrors the ethos of the Processing language, which is both a programming learning tool (as originally intended) and a digital art platform and community unto itself. The Arduino world is based on both Arduino boards—small, simple computers wired into user-friendly systems offering programmable input-output pins, timers, and other features, depending on the board—and the Arduino integrated-development environment (IDE), a piece of free software used for writing and uploading the code that governs an Arduino board. Said code is based on what can seem like its own programming language, but is really a user-friendly subset of C, which is the default language for programming small embedded systems and can be pretty tricky. So, unlike pretty much every other open-source project ever, Arduino has always had the peculiarity of having a physical product that costs money: the boards. What does it even mean to be open-source hardware? This has caused problems. In the beginning, Arduino, LLC was formed to license the Arduino name to hardware manufacturers. These manufacturers would (and still do) build Arduino boards to spec and then sell them. The manufacturer responsible for making the boards in Italy was Smart Projects Srl, which was founded by Martino, one of the original five. Unbeknownst to the rest of the group, in 2008 Martino trademarked the Arduino name in Italy. In a retelling by Massimo Banzi, another of the original five founders, Martino kept this news to himself for almost two years. It was only discovered when lawyers with Arduino, LLC began the process of extending the Arduino trademark beyond the United States. Surprisingly, in Italy it was already registered. For several years, the two Arduinos cooperated, but this changed in 2014. In 2015, Banzi wrote the following in Make magazine: A year ago without explanation, Gianluca’s manufacturing company stopped cooperating with us and unilaterally stopped paying royalties. So if people bought an Arduino board made in Italy in the last year thinking they were supporting the project they should know that we didn’t receive any money for it despite the fact that we designed, documented, maintained and supported those products. (The other manufacturers are still by our side.) Last November, SmartProjects appointed a new CEO, Mr. Musto, who renamed the company to Arduino Srl and created a website called “Arduino” copying our graphics and layout, claiming to have invented Arduino with no mention of us four. They even started printing this new URL on all the new boards. Which all sounds pretty sketchy. But there are also a lot of straight-up Arduino imitators, and, besides that, the DIY hardware universe has naturally expanded and extended otherwise. Nowadays, we have Raspberry Pi, the Texas Instruments Energia platform, Teensyduino, Intel Edison, and others. It's pretty cool. Anyhow, the point is that it makes less and less sense for the Arduino world to remain fractured in a landscape decreasingly dominated by Arduino anyhow. That's my own interpretation of the reconciliation. Here's what Banzi had to say at Maker Faire: "Today is one of the best days in Arduino history. This allows us to start a new course for Arduino made of constructive dialogue and disruptive innovation in the Education, Makers and IoT fields. The Arduino Foundation will allow us to champion the core values of the Arduino Community within the open source ecosystem and to make our commitment to open source stronger than ever. This is really a new beginning for Arduino!" Topics: Makers, trademark, arduino, arduino srl, maker faire, hardware, machines, Disputes Contact the author by email or Twitter.
