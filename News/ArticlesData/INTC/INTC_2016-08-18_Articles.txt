But now the company is looking to be a driving force behind the technology's rise, announcing a ready-to-fly drone called Aero that really is a software development kit designed to push the boundaries of unmanned flight. Intel announced the Aero drone at its Developer Forum in San Francisco this week, alongside an all-in-one VR headset and its new tiny Joule computer. Aero is a fully assembled quadcopter that runs on the newly-announced Aero compute board, a playing card-sized device powered by an Atom quad-core processor that handles storage, communications and input/outputs. This combines with an optional Vision Accessory Kit, which includes an 8-megapixel camera, VGA camera and Intel's RealSense R200 camera, to give software developers flexibility to explore potential applications for drones. Aero will also come equipped with Intel's RealSense Technology, which uses the drone's cameras, processor and sensors to create a model of a 3D environment. Intel first showed off this technology at CES this year onboard a Typhoon H, a hexacopter built by electric aircraft-maker Yuneec. Obstacle avoidance technology is something that has popped up on some consumer models, such as the DJI Phantom 4, but with the ability to detect obstacles and plot alternative courses RealSense sounded like it might be a step up. Amazon to begin drone delivery trials in the UK Amazon has found itself a new ally in its plans to get the Prime Air delivery service off the ground, today announcing a partnership with the UK government to commence trials using its autonomous drones. A planned demonstration is one thing, (even if it did involve dodging falling trees) but picking out obstacles in the real world is another. The good news is that the Typhoon H with RealSense is now available to buy at US$1,899, so we will soon learn how this technology stacks up with consumers at the joysticks. The Aero drone also comes preloaded with AirMap, an airspace management app that tells pilots where it is safe to fly and notifies them of things like wildfires and weather patterns. Intel says that the Aero drone will be available at the end of the year, but there is no word yet on pricing. The Aero compute board on can be preordered separately for $399.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Announcement  ⋮  Hardware AMD’s Zen Outperforms Intel’s $1000 i7 6900K In Its First Ever Demo – Zen Architecture Detailed By Khalid Moammer Posted Aug 18, 2016 1.1kShares Share Tweet Submit This is the moment that all PC hardware enthusiasts have eagerly awaited for nearly half a decade. AMD today has officially pulled back the covers on its brand new high performance Zen CPU microarchitecture, its features, specs and most importantly performance. That’s right, this is the very first time that the company has actually demonstrated the performance of Zen directly against its competition from Intel. This all took place in a private media event that the company held in San Francisco. At which AMD’s President & CEO Lisa Su took the stage alongside Chief Technology Officer Mark Papermaster to talk all about Zen.  So what exactly did they have to say? to summarize it in two words, a LOT! Zen, AMD’s Most Important Product In More Than A Decade Many Years In The making Zen has been one of AMD’s most eagerly anticipated products for as far as I can remember. It’s the company’s first attempt to compete at the high-end, enthusiast, CPU market since the introduction of the Bulldozer microarchitecture five years ago. Zen breaks new ground for AMD in many ways. It’s the company’s first ever CPU architecture to feature simultaneous multithreading. It’s also the very first product for AMD to be built on a process technology that’s very close to parity with Intel since the days of the original Athlon more than a decade ago. This fact alone is huge. It means that for the very first time since the early 2000s AMD’s CPU products won’t be at an inherent disadvantage due to Intel’s process lead. From an architectural point of view Zen is a brand new clean-slate design that’s been led from the get-go by accomplished CPU architect Jim Keller. The very same engineer that played a pivotal role in designing the original Athlon XP and Athlon64 processors. The most competitive CPU products in the history of the company. Zen is AMD’s biggest long-term technology bet and one of the company’s largest engineering efforts undertaken by the company. President & CEO Lisa Su stated that this year’s products, culminated in Zen and Polaris, represent company’s most competitive roadmap in more than a decade. AMD President & CEO Lisa Su – Q4 2015 Earnings Call “We remain focused on completing our strategic work around three key growth pillars. First, in PCs, even in a declining overall market, we believe we can regain client compute and discrete graphics share for the year, driven by gaming, VR, commercial, and our most competitive product roadmap in more than a decade. We have clear opportunities to regain GPU share in 2016 based on the performance per watt of our new GPUs and software leadership. Earlier this quarter at CES, we announced our new Polaris GPU architecture, which we expect to begin shipping in the middle of 2016.” The microarchitecture taped out back in 2015 and is already sampling. Consumer based desktop products are on track to be available en mass in 2017. However, we know that AMD is working on far more than just high performance desktop CPUs. The company has had 32 Core Zen server CPU, a sixteen core Zen HPC APU and a quadcore Zen consumer APU all in the works for several years. The Zen Microarchitecture Below we have a visual representation of Zen’s high-level design from AMD. Interestingly enough it looks very much like our very own in-house diagram that we had published last year.  The integer cluster in each Zen core has six pipes, four ALUs, Arhithmatic Logic Units, and two AGUs which is short for Address Generation Units. These AGUs can perform two 16-byte loads and oine 16-byte store per cycle via a 32 KB 8-way set associative write-back L1 data cache. According to AMD the move from a write-through to a write-back cache has noticeably reduced stalls in several types of code paths. The load/store cache operations cache in Zen also reportedly exhibit lower latency compared to Excavator. AMD Zen Benchmarks Leaked - 8 & 4 Core CPUs with 16 & 8 Threads Confirmed, Rated At 95W & 65W TDP The floating point unit is capable of performing two FMAC operations or a single 256-bit AVX operation per cycle. Exactly as we had detailed in our exclusive architectural deep-dive last year funnily enough. AMD’s First Microarchitecture To Feature Simulataneous Multithreading AMD has done away with the CMT – clustered multi-threading – concept that was introduced with the Bulldozer family of cores in 2011 in favor of a more traditional SMT – sumultaneous multi-threading – design. This means that each Zen core will be able to execute two threads simultaneously. A principal very high throughput thread and a secondary thread that can be used opportunistically. In contrast, each Bulldozer module can execute two identical threads. This is achieved through two separate integer clusters with a single front-end. This approach saves area versus building two separate cores and delivers two high throughput threads. However, there are advantages that Zen’s SMT implementation holds over the Bulldozer CMT implementation.  For one it allows AMD to build a single larger integer cluster with significantly higher single threaded performance. Another advantage with this approach is that it leaves a lot of wiggle room for clever savings in area and power. A Drive For Power Efficiency CPU Microarchitecture AMD Phenom II / K10 AMD BD/PD AMD SR/XV AMD Zen Intel Skylake Instruction Decode Width 3-wide 4-wide 8-wide 4-wide 4-wide Single Core Peak Decode Rate 3 instructions 4 instructions 8 instructions 4 instructions 4 instructions Dual Core Peak Decode Rate 6 instructions 4 instructions 8 instructions 8 instructions 8 instructions A lot of the engineering effort around Zen has also been done to address one of Bulldozer’s major flaws. Bulldozer and Intel’s Sandy Bridge – and subsqeuent Intel architectures including Skylake – had equally deep pipelines to achieve high clock speeds. The deeper the pipeline the more latency that the design will exhibit. Particularly when it comes to branch misprediction errors, which are quite common in such pipelines. The latency that results from branch mispredicts are quite significant. To combat this issue Intel introduced a micro-op cache with Sandy Bridge. It worked to a great extent in reducing mispredict penalties and was believed to be the principle reason behind Sandy Bridge’s significant single threaded performance advantage over Bulldozer. The good news is that AMD has confirmed that it’s finally introducing its own micro-op cache with Zen. Another thing that we had pointed out in our architectural deep dive on Zen last year. On the front-end each Zen core is capable of decoding four instructions per cycle, which are fed to the operations queue. The micro-op cache along with the queue have a throughput of six operations per cycle going into the schedulers. Advertisement The final result is similar overall throughput when we look at both treads of each SMT core vs both threads in each CMT core. This evidenced by the leaked Zen benchmarks that we’ve seen recently. However, Zen delivers significantly higher single threaded performance. Furthermore, because each Bulldozer module houses two integer clusters and a single floating point unit it was always very integer heavy. Each Zen core on the other hand includes one large integer cluster and one large floating point unit making it a much more balanced design. The Zen Microarchitecture In A Nutshell AMD’s brand new Zen core features a significantly wider execution engine than anything we’ve seen before from the company. Leveraging simultaneous multi threading and a micro-op queue to boost throughput and single threaded performance.  This combined with a brand new, low latency cache sub-system and a new set of pre-fetch algorithms result in a dramatic instruction per clock improvement and doubling of throughput per core compared to AMD’s previous 8 Piledriver FX 8300 series CPUs. AMD Celebrates Radeon Technologies Group's First Year Aiming For The Stars High Level View: Two threads per core 8 MB shared L3 cache Large, unified L2 cache Micro-op Cache Two AES units for security 14nm FinFET Transistors AMD : Zen Outperforms Intel’s High-End Broadwell-E CPUs Zen Performance Demo vs Intel’s $1000 Broadwell-E i7 6900X During the event AMD treated the audience to the very first public, real-world performance showdown featuring Zen and a contemporary competing Intel high-end enthusiast class CPU. The demo involved two similarly specced PCs one configured with an eight core, 16 thread Zen engineering sample clocked at 3.0Ghz and the other configured a with an eight core, 16 thread Intel Broadwell-E processor also clocked at 3.0Ghz. Both systems started the same Blender render session at the same time and the Zen CPU was actually able to finish first. This marks the very first time that we have seen an AMD CPU outshine an Intel CPU in instructions per clock in more than a decade. Outperforming the Intel CPU core for core, and clock for clock. That demo represents a truly historic moment for AMD. The key takeaways here are – Zen has better or equivalent IPC to Intel’s highest performing desktop CPUs yet, Broadwell-E. – AMD states that 8 core, 16 thread Zen CPUs will scale to frequencies beyond 3.0Ghz. All New AM4 Socket & Platform AMD is finally bringing all of its desktop products under one roof. The next generation AM4 socket will be compatibel with both desktop APUs and CPUs. This includes the upcoming Excavator based Bristol Ridge APUs which are set to arrive some time during the next four months. As well as the brand new Summit Ridge family of high-performance Zen CPUs. All CPUs inside the Summit Ridge family will include the company’s new platform security processor, PCIe 3.0 support, dual channel DDR4 memory controllers, copious amounts of L3 cache and updated storage features. Including USB3.1 and NVMe. AMD AM4 platform key technology features include: DDR4 Memory PCIe Gen 3 USB 3.1 Gen2 10Gbps NVMe SATA Express Availablity & Closing Comments AMD confirmed that AM4 motherboards will begin shipping throughout the next number of months. The first processors to be available on the new socket are Bristol Ridge APUs, which will begin shipping some time before the Holiday season. The multi-core enthusiast Zen CPUs that have been the subject of most of this article will be available en mass in early 2017 CEO Lisa Su has confirmed. There were some hints that Zen could launch around CES, so January 2017 would be a good bet. It seems that all the stars are lining up for AMD, which has seen its fair share of struggles over the past several years. All the components are there to make Zen a successful product.  It has taken more than a decade, but it’s finally here. An AMD product that can actually challenge Intel’s highest performing Extreme Edition CPUs. It’s almost unfathomable at first thought, after all we all grew accustomed to seeing Intel’s enthusiast CPUs go uncontested for the longest time. Bringing this to a close, it’s clear that AMD’s is doing a lot of things right with Zen. Pushing IPC and power efficiency to where they need to be. Building a comprehensive modern platform and bringing much needed updates to the feature-set. Creating an attractive value proposition for desktop users, servers and notebooks. All the ingredients to make Zen a success are here, all that’s left is for AMD to execute and deliver. The mere prospect that enthusiasts may actually have AMD CPUs as a worthwile option again for the first time in a decade come this October is refreshing. And maybe, just maybe, we’ll finally be able to say “AMD’s back”.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Intel & ARM Announce Historic Licensing Deal; Santa Clara To Also Manufacture 10nm Chips For LG By Ramish Zafar Posted Aug 17, 2016 121Shares Share Tweet Submit Even as Intel dominates in the personal computing space, the company’s yet to make its mark in mobile. Qualcomm and Samsung have dominated this sphere consistently. Despite its advanced manufacturing processes, Intel’s yet to churn out a top tier, long lasting flagship mobile processor. However, that just might change soon. The company’s looking to make some big changes to its semiconductor platform. Intel, will now manufacture chips for other companies such as ARM. To be more precise, it will be licensing technology from Britain’s ARM holdings. This will increase the company’s presence in the mobile sphere significantly. Intel To License ARM’s Chip Licenses To Increase Presence In Mobile Sphere When it comes to processors, there’s no one out there who understands silicon like Intel does. The US company’s stable and dominating presence in personal computing is out there for everyone to witness. However, it’s still manged to fail to translate this in the mobile sphere, where even a fraction of Intel’s modems making it on the iPhone make for big news. However, the company’s fortunes look to change soon. In a historic announcement today, Intel has announced that it will be licensing British design house ARM’s chip designs. In lay man terms, it means that ARM will now be using Intel’s foundries for its chio manufacturing purposes. The announcement was made by the pair at the Intel Developer Forum taking place in San Francisco, California. Advertisement After all, as Moore’s Law comes to an end, Intel’s going to need other avenues for growth. With the server market also slowing down, outsourcing its facilities to other tech houses does seem to be the right move. As Santa Clara starts to manufacture ARM chips, its presence in mobile devices will increase exponentially. However, these won’t be Intel’s own designs – a fact which will take some time to change. Still, it’s a big win for Intel and the company should undoubtedly find new areas for growth after today’s announcement. Intel 200-Series (Z270/H270) Chipset Platform Detailed - Kaby Lake and Skylake Processors To Work On Both 200 and 100 Series Boards Intel’s liason with ARM isn’t the company’s only big mobile news today. We’ve been hearing for quite a while about LG Inc.’s mobile processor. This has been rumored in conjunction with Santa Clara and today, you can confirm these rumors. In a blog post Intel announced that LG will be using its 10nm foundry to manufacture various mobile components. LG’s been stepping up its mobile game for quite a while and increased self sufficiency in this end will help the Korean manufacturer by quite a bit. Thoughts?

 Intel has introduced a ready-to-fly drone BI Intelligence Aug. 19, 2016, 1:24 PM 3,948 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence See Also Autonomous aircraft could soon fight forest fires Amazon Echo owners can now send texts with AT&T The Internet of Everything — $12.6 trillion ROI expected over the next decade [SLIDE DECK] This story was delivered to BI Intelligence IoT Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. At its annual developers conference, Intel released a drone that developers can implement their software on, Engadget is reporting. In some ways, the drone is like a developer board (e.g. Raspberry Pi, Arduino, etc.). While the tech giant did not set a timetable for the release of the drone or a sale price, the company did confirm that it will be made available by the end of 2016. The drone, called Aero, is specifically designed for developers who want to develop and test applications for drones. Aero is powered through an Atom processor and comes with Intel’s RealSense camera for navigation purposes, and the drone comes with cameras powered by Ambarella, the same company who makes GoPro cameras, according to TechCrunch. Additionally, the drone comes pre-loaded with AirMap — an app that helps drone users determine where it is safe and legal to fly a drone. Intel has made equity investments in several drone startups, while AirMap has partnered with drone makers DJI and 3D Robotics.  Drones turned the corner in 2015 to become a popular consumer device, while a framework for regulation that legitimizes drones in the US began to take shape. Technological and regulatory barriers still exist to further drone adoption. Drone manufacturers and software providers are quickly developing technologies like geo-fencing and collision avoidance that will make flying drones safer. The accelerating pace of drone adoption is also pushing governments to create new regulations that balance safety and innovation. Safer technology and better regulation will open up new applications for drones in the commercial sector, including drone delivery programs like Amazon’s Prime Air and Google’s Project Wing initiatives. Jonathan Camhi, research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed drones report that forecasts sales revenues for consumer, enterprise, and military drones. It also projects the growth of drone shipments for consumers and enterprises. The report details several of world’s major drone suppliers and examines trends in drone adoption among several leading industries. Finally, it examines the regulatory landscape in several markets and explains how technologies like obstacle avoidance and drone-to-drone communications will impact drone adoption. Here are some of the key takeaways from the report: We project revenues from drones sales to top $12 billion in 2021, up from just over $8 billion last year. Shipments of consumer drones will more than quadruple over the next five years, fueled by increasing price competition and new technologies that make flying drones easier for beginners. Growth in the enterprise sector will outpace the consumer sector in both shipments and revenues as regulations open up new use cases in the US and EU, the two biggest potential markets for enterprise drones. Technologies like geo-fencing and collision avoidance will make flying drones safer and make regulators feel more comfortable with larger numbers of drones taking to the skies. Right now FAA regulations have limited commercial drones to a select few industries and applications like aerial surveying in the agriculture, mining, and oil and gas sectors. The military sector will continue to lead all other sectors in drone spending during our forecast period thanks to the high cost of military drones and the growing number of countries seeking to acquire them. In full, the report: Compares drone adoption across the consumer, enterprise, and government sectors. Breaks down drone regulations across several key markets and explains how they’ve impacted adoption. Discusses popular use cases for drones in the enterprise sector, as well as nascent use case that are on the rise. Analyzes how different drone manufacturers are trying to differentiate their offerings with better hardware and software components. Explains how drone manufacturers are quickly enabling autonomous flight in their products that will be a major boon for drone adoption.

Intel And Teleportation Related Content Topic :  Routers  Intelligent forwarding devices connect various networks and public Internet Blog :  Mellanox Offloads VLAN Processing Microsoft vs. Intel and Teleportation Rob Enderle |   Unfiltered Opinion   |   Posted 19 Aug, 2016          |         |     Share I’ve flown home from Intel’s Developer Forum and one of the things that really had me thinking was a chat I had with Achin Bhowmilk, Ph.D., who is likely one of the smartest guys I know. He runs the group at Intel that has the RealSense camera and is working on its Merged Reality effort. This effort is in competition with Microsoft’s Mixed Reality effort, even though both companies are actually collaborating on what could be something far closer to teleportation than any video conferencing or telepresence effort currently in market. Microsoft calls its idea of this concept Holoportation. While Holoportation only works for one person at the moment, what Intel is talking about could work for both. Let’s contrast Mixed Reality and Merged Reality and talk about why Intel’s Merged Reality effort could be a better solution for keeping our butts out of airplane seats. Merged vs. Mixed Reality Microsoft is clearly much farther along with its solution than Intel is, and the Microsoft solution fits better into where technology is today because it potentially uses less processing power, which makes the headset smaller, lighter, and potentially more power efficient. With Microsoft HoloLens and mixed reality, the headset scans the room and renders a virtual image in it. However, the result looks “ghostly.” While that may be perfect for situations where the product is currently targeted, industrial and scientific uses, it isn’t ideal for when you actually want to transport the individual using the device someplace else. Intel’s approach is far more powerful because it not only scans the environment, it can render it. This allows you to alter the environment the user sees and potentially create a seamless weave between what is virtual and what is real because everything is effectively virtual. This means that, like Mixed Reality, you can interact with physical objects in your space (and, using some kind of remote robot, interact with things in the remote spaces) but you’ll feel more like you are in the remote location. And because that location is rendered, you can alter it so that it appears like something else. Teleportation The problem with Holoportation is that you can’t get rid of the image of the goggles. In the Holoportation video, the presenter’s daughter, who is remote, doesn’t see her father because she isn’t wearing the HoloLens and interacts with him as a disembodied voice. The father does get a more complete experience but he sees his daughter like a ghost, which could be pretty cool on Halloween but not that realistic the rest of the time. In addition, you also have to rig the room cameras like you do with VR in both rooms so the two can somewhat interact but it really isn’t real for either party. With Intel’s merged reality, you can render out the headset as part of the process. In addition, while you are at it, you can render out your clothing, remove age from your features, render makeup, even render different hair colors and styles, and it would all be very realistic. You could imagine having women’s clothing automatically adjusted to region-specific requirements without any of the women ever having to change. You could even show up to a virtual meeting naked, though, if there was a glitch, that meeting could take an unfortunate turn. (I wonder if you’d be told at the time or after the meeting. “By the way Sally, you do realize that if you are going to conference in naked and do a presentation you need to actually select the ‘render clothing’ option, right?”)  Wrapping Up: What’s in Store I think we are getting very close to something almost indistinguishable from Teleportation but without the nasty issues of what happens if you actually vaporize someone and recreate them someplace else. Merged Reality could finally make it so we could travel to another part of the world instantly and make us feel like we are actually there. And because Intel’s solution is self-contained (though likely will need some heavy cloud-based services to work), it would be far easier to set up. My expectation is that we are looking at something that won’t emerge in acceptable resolutions and costs until around 2025 but when it does, this could actually change how we interact globally and put long distance business travel, and even some vacation travel, on the road to obsolescence.

Merged Reality - We see our Hands / Body / Tools Merged in Virtual (reality) Surroundings /Environment. Merged Reality is no way as awesome as MixedReality. Merged Reality is even way less exciting than Augmented Reality. All the Best! Reply Aug 19, 2016 9:04 PM Urgelt  says: Naw. Look, rendering a distant scene makes you blind to your local reality, and that means you have to be sitting, or something's going to break. The strength of merged reality isn't in teleportation. It's in rendering and editing your local reality - which you can still see, so you don't break things or get hurt. You can get a tiny taste of it with the Pokemon smartphone thing that's trending right now, but you can get a better feel for the possibilities in science fiction. You visit a museum and get a tour from a virtual person who doesn't actually exist. He's fictional. You enter a gaming area - a physical reality, could be a state forest or an arena, anything, really, that's marked out for merged reality experiences - and experience role-playing games. Yes, you can cast that fireball and incinerate monsters with it, in fidelity equal to reality because it's merged with reality. Want to see what early settlers saw of the American frontier? Put on your merged reality headset and all of the power lines and roads and buildings in an area can be edited out. Those are only examples. It's a very powerful technology - but it's mainly local. Reply Aug 21, 2016 2:04 PM Donald Berrian  says: During my career I spent a lot of time on airplanes between Boston, San Jose, Japan, and Korea. Only a few of those trips were made for the sole purpose of sitting in a meeting room. Business meetings are a perpetual butt of humor on Dilbert for being a complete waste of the participants time and I know of engineers who only work for small companies in order to avoid them. My impression of internet enabled meetings is that the ability to conduct them just provides another excuse for wasting employees time. They won't decrease business travel because, in most cases, it is actually necessary to be there physically to accomplish anything. Senior executives may travel just to go to meetings but no one else gets sent half way around the world to do something that could be done using a telephone call or Email. Reply Aug 29, 2016 5:04 AM Ton Smith  says: in response to William The idea behind this is great but as you said this won't emerge in acceptable resolutions and costs , we need to wait till 2025 to have higher clouding services.

This solution monitors the status of a home’s front door and garage door for increased security. The gateway gathers data from a doorbell, door lock, stepper motors, and a garage door application for edge data analytics. Editorial Note This article is for our sponsors at CodeProject. These articles are intended to provide you with information on products and services that we consider useful and of value to developers Get access to the new Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution that allows developers to create exciting new solutions with the Intel® Galileo and Intel® Edison boards. Visit the Intel® Developer Zone for IoT. To demonstrate a smart home vertical rapid path to product edge IoT solution using cloud data analytics, a proof of concept was created using the Intel® IoT Developer Kit and Grove* IoT Commercial Developer Kit, and scaled to an industrial solution using an Intel® IoT Gateway, industrial sensors, Intel® IoT Gateway Software Suite, Intel® XDK IoT Edition, and IBM Bluemix* cloud services. This solution monitors the status of a home’s front door and garage door for increased security. The gateway gathers data from a doorbell, door lock, stepper motors, and a garage door application for edge data analytics. The promise of the Internet of Things (IoT) is to provide connectivity that lets us control and be aware of countless points of presence, everywhere and all the time. As the center of every consumer’s world, the home is possibly the most vital site where this vision is unfolding. In short, when we are away from our homes, we would like to know that they are secure, and technology can play a rich role in making it so. Everyone has had the nagging suspicion that they left the door unlocked or the garage door open, often when it was too late to conveniently double-check. And in a world of instantaneous access to infinite information from anywhere, anytime, that can be hard to take. Many of us are ready to adopt (and pay for) solutions that can remove this annoyance. While many products are available on the general market to enable the smart home, this segment is still in its infancy, and insufficient interoperability exists among products and components from various vendors. Intel has identified value to building solutions using standards-based, open platforms. This approach would allow for a whole- home approach that enables simple implementation of smart devices, with security and monitoring through the cloud. The corresponding commercial potential for these products and services is substantial. Intel undertook a development project to investigate this and other opportunities associated with building systems for the smart home. The project drew inspiration in large part from the existing solution blueprint of the smart home platform from Yoga Systems. This document recounts the course of that project development effort. It begins with an abstract description of a structured project methodology, divided into phases, and then recounts the process of the project’s development in detail, phase by phase. Interested parties can use this narrative to retrace the steps taken by the Intel project team in developing the smart home path to product. Perhaps more importantly, however, it can be generalized as a set of guidelines to address the needs of other types of projects. Intel makes this document freely available and encourages the use of this methodology and process to drive inquiry, invention, and innovation for the IoT. This article contains an overview of the IoT Path-to-Product: Smart Home. To see the project tutorial, see IoT Path-to-Product: How to Build the Smart Home Prototype. Visit GitHub for this project's latest code samples and documentation. Methodology By its nature, the IoT embraces open- ended innovation, with an endless diversity of projects to add intelligence to objects from the simple to the complex, and from the mundane to the exotic. At the same time, every project builds on experience the industry has gained from IoT projects that have gone before, and best practices suggest structural elements in common among IoT projects in general. To take advantage of those commonalities and help increase the chances of success during development, Intel has developed a structured approach to IoT project development. This approach consists of a six-phase model that guides the entire path to product, which begins with the first glimmer of an idea and follows through until the final solution is in commercial deployment. The six- phase model is intended to be general enough that it can be adapted to the needs of any IoT project. Initiation Phases (1-3) The first three phases of the project methodology are investigative. They focus on ideation and assessing the potential of the project to solve a given problem, in preparation for ultimately leading to a commercially viable product. As such, these phases value brainstorming and proof of concept over rigorously addressing the finer points of design. Rapid prototyping is facilitated by using the Grove IoT Commercial Developer Kit, which consists of an Intel® NUC system, Intel® IoT Gateway Software Suite, and the Grove Starter Kit Plus (manufactured by Seeed). The project also uses the Arduino* 101 board. Note: Known in the United States as "Arduino 101," this board is known elsewhere as "Genuino* 101." It is referred to throughout the rest of this document as the "Arduino 101" board. Phase 1 Define the opportunity that the project will take advantage of. The first step of an IoT project is to identify the problem or opportunity that the project will address. Documentation at this stage should identify the opportunity itself, the value of the solution (to end users as well as the organizations that build and implement it), and limitations of the project concept, including design challenges and constraints. Phase 2 Design a proof of concept to take advantage of the opportunity. The initial solution design proposes a practical approach to building the solution, including hardware, software, and network elements. The design must address the design challenges and constraints identified in Phase 1 to the extent that is possible before building a prototype, including due consideration of factors such as cost and security. Phase 3 Build and refine the proof of concept. The solution prototype is based on the design established in Phase 2, making and documenting changes as needed. Design changes based on shortcomings and additional opportunities identified during testing should be documented as part of this phase. Completion Phases (4 – 6) The last three phases of the project methodology proceed only after the decision has been made to go forward with productizing the solution. As such, these phases are explicitly concerned with hardening, in terms of stability, security, and manageability, preparing the product for mass production, and monetizing it to realize its commercial potential. The completion phases of the project involve shifting the solution to industrial-grade sensors and related components, building it out using a commercial-grade gateway, and finalizing the feature set. Phase 4: Produce a solid beta version. Once the project has been approved as a viable solution to develop toward production, the next step is to produce a product-oriented version that is explicitly intended to finalize the design. This version represents a significant investment in resources, including commercial- grade sensors and other components, as well as a commercial IoT gateway. Phase 5 Evaluate functionality and add features. The completed beta version of the solution is tested to verify that it functions correctly according to the design parameters. As part of the testing process, the project team also identifies additional features and functionality, which are incorporated into the solution to make it more robust and valuable to end users. Phase 6 Finalize design and move into production. Once the product is feature-complete, the team hardens the solution by adding advanced manageability and security features, as well as optimizing the design as needed to enhance factors such as marketability and efficiency of manufacturing. The production user interface (UI) for the solution is also finalized. This phase also includes final planning for merchandising and marketing the solution before moving into full production. Phase 1: Defining the Opportunity Sensors to detect the status of a door being locked or unlocked, a doorbell being rung, and a garage door being open or closed provide rudimentary data, but the significance of that data can be profound. The duality between the simplicity of this information and its significance is the basis for the commercial value potential of this solution. The core group of project initiators at Intel determined that a smart home is viable as the basis for a potential project to demonstrate IoT capabilities and the project methodology described here. That core group identified skill sets that were likely to be required during the project, including project management, programming, cloud architecture, and documentation. Based on that list of required skills, the core group formed the full project team, with personnel on the project mostly drawn from Intel employees, with external personnel included in a small number of instances to round out the expertise of the team. The full project team’s first order of business was to quantify the potential opportunity associated with the project, as the basis for the initial prototype design. The core opportunity for this use case was identified as integrating programmatic control and notification associated with certain functions of the smart home, including the following: Front door: The project will lock and unlock the door and provide status about the locked/unlocked state as well as the open/closed state of the door on the physical model. Doorbell: When the doorbell button is pushed on the model, a visual representation will be displayed on the administration application and the mobile application. Garage door: Users can send commands from the mobile application to raise and lower the garage door. The mobile application will also display the door’s progress as it opens or closes and provide an alert if the door is blocked from closing. Sensors will detect and send this information to the cloud to enable logging and analytics, as well as remote secure access so a user can view event notifications and status of the various smart-home elements listed above. The team also identified opportunities to further expand the solution that it designated as being out of scope for this project. These included managed service offerings for both residential and commercial customers, including incorporation into existing solutions to enrich home-security offerings. Phase 2: Designing the Proof-of-Concept Prototype The project team determined that, for this project to be as useful as possible for the developer community, it should be based on readily available parts and technologies. Based on that decision, it was decided to limit the bill of materials to the Grove IoT Commercial Developer Kit, Intel® IoT Developer Kit, and Intel® IoT Gateway Software Suite (https://software.intel.com/en-us/node/633283), using software technologies that are widely used in the industry and available at low or no cost, with the use of free open-source software (FOSS) wherever practical. To accelerate the prototype stage and reduce its complexity, the team elected to build the local portion of the prototype as a bench model that would consist of the compute platform and sensors, without incorporating an actual scale model of a smart home, although such a model would be added at a future stage of the project. Prototype Hardware Selection The Intel® NUC Kit DE3815TYKHE small-form-factor PC was chosen for this project. This platform is pictured in Figure 1, and its high-level specifications are given in Table 1. In addition to its robust performance, the team felt that, as Intel’s most recently introduced hardware platform specifically targeting IoT, it was a forward-looking choice for this demonstration project. Based on the Intel® Atom™ processor E3815, the Intel NUC offers a fanless thermal solution, 4 GB of onboard flash storage (and SATA connectivity for additional storage), as well as a wide range of I/O ports. The Intel NUC is conceived as a highly compact and customizable device that provides capabilities at the scale of a desktop PC. To simplify the process of interfacing with sensors, the team elected to take advantage of the Arduino ecosystem using the Arduino 101 board, also shown in Figure 1, with specifications given in Table 1. This board makes the Intel NUC both hardware and pin compatible with Arduino shields, in keeping with the open-source ideals of the project team. While Bluetooth* is not used in the current iteration of the project, the board does have that functionality, which the team is considering for future use. Table 1. Prototype hardware use in the smart home project   Intel® NUC Kit DE3815TYKHE Arduino* 101 Board Processor / Microcontroller Intel® Atom™ processor E3815 (512K Cache, 1.46 GHz) Intel® Curie™ Compute Module @ 32 MHz Memory 8 GB DDR3L-1066 SODIMM (max) 196 KB flash memory 24 KB SRAM Networking / IO Integrated 10/100/1000 LAN 14 Digital IO pins 6 Analog IO pins Dimensions 190 mm x 116 mm x 40 mm 68.6 mm x 53.4 mm Specifications Full specs Full specs Figure 1. Intel® NUC Kit DE3815TYKHE and Arduino* 101 board For the sensors and other components needed in the creation of the prototype, the team chose the Grove Starter Kit for Arduino (manufactured by Seeed Studio), which is based on the Grove Starter Kit Plus used in the Grove IoT Commercial Developer Kit. This collection of components is available at low cost, and because it is a preselected set of parts, it reduces the effort required to identify and procure the bill of materials for IoT prototypes in general. Selection of sensors and other components for the prototype (detailed in the following section) are guided by key data that includes the following: Locked/unlocked status of the front door Open/closed status of the front door Open/closed status of the garage door Blocked/unblocked status of the garage door Events: doorbell ring, lock/unlock front door, open/close front door, open/close garage door, block garage door Prototype Software Specification For the prototype OS, the team considered Yocto Linux* as well as Intel® IoT Gateway Software Suite. Yocto Linux supports the project’s ideal of using FOSS, and it offers a high degree of flexibility, as well as robust control over the source code and the ability to create a custom lightweight embedded OS that is tailored to the needs of the system. Intel® IoT Gateway Software Suite, on the other hand, provides an out-of-the-box implementation, without requirements for customization. It also provides Node- RED functionality for development. The team identified this combination of factors as a best practice for prototype development, and so Intel® IoT Gateway Software Suite was chosen as the OS for the prototype. The following applications were identified to be developed as part of the solution: Control application will run on the smart-home model itself, gathering data from sensors and handling operation of the electromechanical aspects of the solution (for example, opening/closing the garage door), as well as data exchange with both human users (that is, through the administration and mobile applications) and with the cloud. Administration application will operate on a PC or tablet and allow for a detailed view into the operation of the smart home, including events, status, and logs, as well as access to the cloud data and analytics. Mobile application will operate on a smartphone or other mobile device, enabling a customer to open and close the garage door as well as monitor the progress of the door as it opens and closes or is blocked. Phase 3: Building and Refining the Proof of Concept Prototype Using the Intel® NUC Kit DE3815TYKHE, the Arduino 101 board, and the Grove Starter Kit Plus IoT Edition, the team developed the proof of concept prototype illustrated in Figure 2. The prototype is built as a benchtop proof of concept that is not attached to mechanical parts such as working doors, which the project team determined are not required at this stage. Instead, for example, the rotary angle sensor is used to simulate the locking and unlocking of the front door, the stepper motor stands in for the garage door, and a simple button functions as the doorbell button would in a full model of the smart home. Figure 2. Smart home proof-of-concept prototype The bill of materials for the prototype is summarized in Table 2. Table 2.

The control application used in the proof-of-concept prototype was written in JavaScript*. It accesses IBM Bluemix to transfer data to and from the mobile and administration applications to support functions that include opening and closing the garage door, locking and unlocking the front door, as well as for notifications of events such as the doorbell ringing. The mobile application was written in JavaScript for use in a web browser, to avoid the necessity of migrating the application to multiple smartphone platforms. The development environment used to develop the software for this solution was the Intel® XDK IoT Edition, which is included in the Grove IoT Commercial Developer Kit and can be downloaded free of charge. It enables developers to create and run Node.js applications directly on Intel® architecture-based IoT platforms, including the Intel® NUC Kit DE3815TYKHE, as well as remote debugging capabilities. Node-RED is also a development option. In order to access I/O on the Intel NUC, it is necessary to declare MRAA, which is a C/C++ library with bindings to JavaScript and Python*, to interface with other platforms. It provides a structured and sane API, where port names and numbering match the physical hardware. For more information, visit GitHub. In addition, the development of this solution used Firmata, which allows for programmatic interaction with the Arduino development environment, taking advantage of Arduino’s hardware abstraction capabilities. Abstracting Firmata using Libmraa enables greater programmatic control of I/O on the Intel NUC, simplifying the process of gathering data from sensors. UPM provides the specific function calls that are used to access sensors. The smart home proof-of-concept prototype includes an activation button for the garage door, an activation button and buzzer for the doorbell, a touch sensor to identify the open/ closed status of the front door, a rotary angle sensor to simulate the locking and unlocking of the front door, and a backlit RGB LCD display that shows the open/closed status of the garage door and front door, as well as displaying a message when the doorbell is rung. The prototype also includes indicator LEDs that show the open/closed status of the garage door. The smart-home software application, which is built in Node.js, collects input data from the sensors and displays information on the LCD display. If the "Door Open" message is displayed on the LCD, the green LED is lit. If the "Door Close" message is displayed on the LCD, the red LED is lit. The application can also control a stepper motor to open and close an actual garage door, although for the sake of simplicity, the motor is not implemented in the proof-of-concept prototype. Phase 4: Producing a Solid Beta Version Once the proof of concept for the smart home was completed, the project team determined that the functionality was sufficiently successful to proceed with building a production version. The solution as a whole was conceived at this stage as including the following parts: Physical model of the home, built to scale and including the functional parts highlighted in the solution: the doorbell, front door, garage door, and related systems. Gateway, which is purchased as a commercial product based on Intel architecture and implemented using custom-developed software. Client application, implemented in JavaScript, which is used to control the solution as a whole and to generate and access cloud-based analytics. Cloud analytics, based on IBM Bluemix, which allow for the development of insights to improve business processes, based on usage data from the vending machine over time. Selecting Components for the Beta Version of the Project An early effort in the completion phases of the project involved selecting the specific components that would make up the final solution in production. Smart-Home Model Procurement Whereas the team had elected to create the proof-of-concept prototype as a board-level simulation of a smart home, it decided that the production version was to be based on a scale model of an actual house. The team engaged an external fabricator with expertise in building sophisticated, functional scale models. The initial specification for the smart-home model and an artist’s rendering of the finished model are shown in Figure 3. Other key decisions to be made at this stage included the choice of industrial- grade sensors, an Intel architecture- based gateway, a cloud service for data storage and analytics, and software technologies for the client application. Sensors and Related Components Selection Industrial-grade sensors and related components to replace those from the Grove Starter Kit that were used in the proof-of-concept prototype are detailed in Table 3. Custom model house built at 1/12 scale from tight-ply plywood with metal reinforcement, an approximate size of three feet in each dimension, and the following components: Manually-opened front door with Intel-provided sensors to detect open/closed status and operable doorbell button. Power-operated garage door with Intel-provided stepper motor and sensors to detect down and up end of travel, plus a small nylon shear screw to prevent damage if door is blocked. Figure 3.

Ready commercial availability was clearly needed so the project could proceed on schedule. The gateway must also be available in sufficient quantities for the hypothetical productization of the smart-home concept. Ultimately, the Dell iSeries Wyse 3290 IoT Gateway, specifications of which are summarized in Table 4, was chosen for implementation in the product phase of this project. That gateway provides the needed performance for present and foreseeable functionality, as well as ready availability (potentially in large quantities) for hypothetical commercial distribution of the smart-home product. The team agreed that continuing to use Intel® IoT Gateway Software Suite (which the prototype was already based on) was a straightforward decision, particularly because the gateway is pre-validated for that OS. Moreover, Intel® NUCs and gateways can both run Intel® IoT Gateway Software Suite, simplifying the process of porting software elements from the prototype to the product version of the smart- home model. Likewise, the other core software components such as the Intel® XDK and libraries used in the prototype were held constant to simplify the transition to the product phase. Sensor status for the smart home product phase is summarized in Table 5. For each sensor, the "Open" and "Closed" values give the logic level returned, and "Edge Action" indicates what transitions to monitor. Table 4.

Figure 4. Smart home solution topology Phase 5: Evaluating Functionality and Adding Features Prior to evaluating the smart-home solution, the team installed the hardware and software components into the model, as shown in Figure 5. Differentiation of Administration and Mobile Applications Figure 5. Smart-home solution installed in model The project team identified that it would be valuable for the solution to include two separate applications for control and monitoring of the smart- home solution: Client application, for use by system administrators, supports test/debug functionality and provides access to cloud-analytics data. Mobile application, for use by end users, allows control of the doorbell and garage door opener and displays open/closed status of both doors. The team also decided to add status monitoring of the lock on the front door. Implementing Administration and Mobile Applications for Browsers Rather than providing multiple versions of a rich-client application for different platforms (or taking on the added complexity of cross-platform rich- client development), the team decided to implement the administration and mobile applications in HTML5 and JavaScript using the Intel XDK IoT Edition. This approach allows for a single version of each application to be consumed by multiple hardware platforms in use by administrators and end users. The key platforms identified by the team include the following: iOS* devices, including iPads* and iPhones* Android* devices, including smartphones and tablets Laptop and desktop PCs running Windows* or Linux Door Lock Functionality The team identified that it would be valuable to add functionality to show the locked/unlocked status of the front door, in addition to the open/closed status of the front door and garage door. Therefore, a door lock was added to the specifications of the model given to the fabricator. Cloud Alerts The following cloud-based functionality was added: When the garage door opens, a light turns on inside the garage. The light turns off after a specified period when the garage door is closed. If the garage door is left open for a specified period of time, an alert is generated to the user. If the front door is left open or unlocked for a certain period of time, an alert is generated to the user. Additional Authorization Methods for Entry The potential exists to integrate an open-ended set of ways for people to identify themselves to the smart-home systems, for access to the front door or garage door. These could potentially range from near field communication (NFC) functionality on a smartphone to biometrics such as thumbprint readers. This extension of functionality has not been implemented, but the modular nature of the smart-home design and availability of additional sensor capacity makes it plausible as a future effort. Phase 6: Finalizing Design and Releasing to Production The project team tasked with developing this solution was engineering-centric, and so producing first-rate UIs for the final product was somewhat outside the team’s core competency. Therefore, the team engaged an external resource on a contract basis for that purpose. The UI provider participated in regular team meetings and dedicated meetings with the core software-development team. Figure 6. Smart home administration application UI During those discussions, the UIs were refined to incorporate additional capabilities and functionality. For example, the team added more robust status indications for the garage door and front door to indicate whether the doors were open, closed, locked, or blocked. The visual appearance of the mobile application was changed to more closely evoke the appearance of a conventional garage door opener. Administration Application UI The administration application UI, shown in Figure 6, is designed to operate on a tablet computer and to provide administrative functionality for the smart home, based on cloud data. The administration application UI incorporates the following primary elements: Menu system contains a Home button to go to the home screen (shown in the figure), an About screen with information about the software, a Setup button that provides hardware-setup details (including placement and connectivity of sensors), and a Log button to access an events log that tracks the most recent instance of each type of event tracked, including the doorbell being rung, the front door being locked, unlocked, opened, or closed, and the garage door being opened, closed, or blocked. Notification panel displays event notifications about the doorbell being rung and changes in the status of the front door (opening, closing, locking, and unlocking) and the garage door (opening, closing, or being blocked). This display is based on data that is exchanged with and saved in the cloud, rather than locally derived data. It displays both the event itself and the sensor that has detected it. Status panel shows the most recent instances of each of the events tracked by the system, including the garage door being opened, closed, or blocked, the front door being opened, closed, locked, or unlocked, and the doorbell ringing. It includes timestamps for each event. Front door view shows the open or closed status of the door, as well as an animated icon to indicate whether the door is locked or unlocked. Visual notification is also provided when the doorbell is rung. Garage door view provides an animated display of the garage door opening, closing, or being blocked by an object as those actions occur. If the door is blocked, the application shows the block visually in the animation and prevents the door from closing. The administration application also provides pop-up notifications about requested actions that can’t be fulfilled, such as the "The front door is locked. Unlock it first." A similar notification occurs if a user tries to lock the door while it is open. Mobile Application UI Figure 7. Smart-home mobile application UI The mobile application UI, shown in Figure 7, is designed to operate on a smartphone, allowing customers to open and close the garage door on the smart home. It also reports on the status of the door, based on the polling of cloud data once per second. The mobile application UI incorporates the following primary elements: Notification panel shows the open or closed status of the garage door, and the action of the garage door opening or closing using an animation. It also indicates whether the door has been blocked by an obstruction by showing an obstruction within the animation and presenting a "Remove block to continue" dialog box to the user. Open and close buttons allow the user to remotely open and close the garage door. When a button is pressed, the application sends data to the cloud, receives a response from the cloud, and displays the status of the door based on that response. The administration application also responds immediately to actions taken with the mobile application. Conclusion A structured process is vital to the efficiency of moving a project such as the smart home described here from the early stages of ideation through prototyping and ultimately to production of a commercial solution. The six-phase approach described here is intended to provide a model that organizations can adapt to the needs of their own projects. By prototyping on low- cost components similar to those used by the maker community, the viability of a project can be discerned early in the project, whilvpne the investment in time and money is limited. For those projects that show promise, feature refinements can be made and the solution can be moved to a production-ready platform based on a commercial gateway and industrial-grade sensors and other components. This stepwise approach to project development provides a pathway toward commercially viable products that helps limit risk while enabling project teams to innovate freely.

This solution monitors the inventory, product sales, and maintenance of a vending machine. The gateway gathers data from temperature sensors, stepper motors, a coil switch, and a product-purchasing application for edge data analytics. Editorial Note This article is for our sponsors at CodeProject. These articles are intended to provide you with information on products and services that we consider useful and of value to developers Get access to the new Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution that allows developers to create exciting new solutions with the Intel® Galileo and Intel® Edison boards. Visit the Intel® Developer Zone for IoT. To demonstrate a rapid path-to-product IoT solution for retail using cloud data analytics, a proof of concept was created using the Intel® IoT Developer Kit and Grove* IoT Commercial Developer Kit that was scaled to an industrial solution using an Intel® IoT Gateway, industrial sensors, Intel® IoT Gateway Software Suite, Intel® System Studio, and Microsoft* Azure* cloud services. This solution monitors the inventory, product sales, and maintenance of a vending machine. The gateway gathers data from temperature sensors, stepper motors, a coil switch, and a product-purchasing application for edge data analytics. This article contains an overview of the creation of the Intelligent Vending Machine Prototype. For a how to, see IoT Path-to-Product: How to Build an Intelligent Vending Machine. Visit GitHub for this project's latest code samples and documentation. A key vector of opportunity related to the Internet of Things (IoT) springs from adding intelligence to everyday devices, as a means to improve their operation as well as the efficiency and effectiveness of the business operations associated with them. For example, vending machines are ubiquitous, and the familiar, common machines with coin or currency acceptors represent a significant potential revenue stream for retailers of various types. It’s no wonder that the scope of goods available in vending machines has grown dramatically in recent years, including consumer electronics being commonly sold in airports and other facilities. Figure 1. Completed intelligent vending machine. Vending machines have the advantage over other retail points of presence that they operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year, without the requirement for human cashiers. They also give distributors significant control where it would otherwise not be possible, such as in public spaces and office buildings. At the same time, however, vending machines require regular service: frequently to replenish the product being sold and less frequently for scheduled and unscheduled maintenance. Giving the owners of vending machines greater insight into the status of each unit in their vending fleet has the potential to improve the efficiency of that service effort. Intel® undertook a development project to investigate this and other opportunities associated with building an intelligent vending machine. The completed device is shown in Figure 1. This project drew inspiration in large part from the existing solution blueprint for intelligent vending machines from Intel and ADLINK Technologies. This document recounts the course of that project development effort. It begins with an abstract description of a structured project methodology, divided into phases, and then recounts the process of the project’s development in detail, phase by phase. Interested parties can use this narrative to retrace the steps taken by the Intel® project team in developing the intelligent vending machine. Perhaps more importantly, however, it can be generalized as a set of guidelines to address the needs of other types of projects. Intel® makes this document freely available and encourages the use of this methodology and process to drive inquiry, invention, and innovation for the Internet of Things. Methodology By its nature, IoT embraces open-ended innovation, with endless diversity of projects to add intelligence to objects from the simple to the complex, and from the mundane to the exotic. At the same time, every project builds on experience the industry has gained from IoT projects that have gone before, and best practices suggest structural elements in common among IoT projects in general. To take advantage of those commonalities and help increase the chances of success during development, Intel has developed a structured approach to IoT project development. It consists of a six-phase model that guides the entire path to product, which begins with the first glimmer of an idea and follows through until the final solution is in commercial use. It is intended to be general enough that it can be adapted to the needs of any IoT project. Initiation phases (1-3) The first three phases of the project methodology are investigative. They focus on ideation and assessing the potential of the project to solve a given problem, in preparation for ultimately leading to a commercially viable product. As such, these phases value brainstorming and proof of concept over rigorously addressing finer points of design. Rapid prototyping is facilitated by using the Grove* IoT Commercial Developer Kit, which consists of an Intel® NUC system, Intel® IoT Gateway Software Suite, and the Grove* Starter Kit Plus (manufactured by Seeed). The project also uses the Arduino* 101 board. Note: Known in the United States as "Arduino 101," this board is known elsewhere as "Genuino* 101." It is referred to throughout the rest of this document as the "Arduino 101" board. Phase 1:Define the opportunity that the project will take advantage of. The first step of an IoT project is to identify the problem or opportunity that the project will address. Documentation at this stage should identify the opportunity itself, the value of the solution (to end users as well as the organizations that build and implement it), and limitations of the project concept, including design challenges and constraints. Phase 2: Design a proof of concept to take advantage of the opportunity. The initial solution design proposes a practical approach to building the solution, including hardware, software, and network elements. The design must address the design challenges and constraints identified in Phase 1 to the extent that is possible before building a prototype, including due consideration of factors such as cost and security. Phase 3: Build and refine the proof of concept. The solution prototype is based on the design established in Phase 2, making and documenting changes as needed. Design changes based on shortcomings and additional opportunities identified during testing should be documented as part of this phase. Completion phases (4-6) The last three phases of the project methodology proceed only after the decision has been made to go forward with productizing the solution. As such, these phases are explicitly concerned with hardening the solution in terms of stability, security, and manageability, preparing it for mass production, and monetizing it to realize its commercial potential. The completion phases of the project involve shifting the solution to industrial-grade sensors and related components, building it out using a commercial-grade gateway, and finalizing the feature set. Phase 4: Produce a solid beta version. Once the project has been approved as a viable solution to develop toward production, the next step is to produce a product-oriented version that is explicitly intended to finalize the design. This version represents a significant investment in resources, including commercial-grade sensors and other components, as well as a commercial IoT gateway. Phase 5: Evaluate functionality and add features. The completed beta version of the solution is tested to verify that it functions correctly according to the design parameters. As part of the testing process, the project team also identifies additional features and functionality and incorporates them into the solution to make it more robust and valuable to end users. Phase 6: Finalize design and move into production. Once the product is feature-complete, the team hardens the solution by adding advanced manageability and security features, as well as optimizing the design as needed to enhance factors such as marketability and efficiency of manufacturing. The production user interface (UI) for the solution is finalized. This phase also includes final planning for merchandising and marketing the solution before moving into full production. Phase 1: Defining the opportunity While traditional vending machines represent lucrative revenue streams, they are woefully inefficient. Each machine must be serviced on a regular basis by a human attendant to replenish the machine’s stock of product. This task is typically handled by assigning machines to regular routes that are followed by personnel in trucks. To understand the inherent inefficiency in this approach, consider the activity along a route that includes a high-rise office building. Here, the attendant pulls up in front of the building and has the choice either to guess what will be needed in the machines up on the 15th and 20th floors, bring the product up, and then make another round trip to bring the rest of what was needed, or else to make a dedicated inventory trip with a notepad in hand. Either approach takes needless time and effort that costs the vending company money. Moreover, distributors must seek a balance between dispatching too many trips by attendants (wasting payroll hours) or too few (leaving machines depleted of stock and missing out on revenue). The situation becomes even more problematic because the distributor must depend to some degree on end-customers to report when a machine is out of order. Project initiators at Intel® determined that an intelligent vending machine is viable as the basis for a potential project to demonstrate IoT capabilities and the project methodology described in this document. That core group identified skill sets that were likely to be required during the project, including project management, programming, cloud architecture, and documentation. Based on that list of required skills, the core group formed the full project team, with personnel on the project mostly drawn from Intel employees, with external personnel included in a small number of instances to round out the expertise of the team. The full project team’s first order of business was to quantify the potential opportunity associated with the project, as the basis for the initial prototype design. The core opportunity for this use case was identified as enabling a vending machine to intelligently monitor its level of product inventory and its operational status, and to be able to report that information back through an IoT gateway to the cloud. The team elected to integrate cloud resources for the data store and administrative functionality. The goal of this approach was to facilitate a fully connected and scalable solution that optimize operations using an overall view of a fleet of vending machines. The key value to the cloud approach lies in the potential for analytics, which could potentially predict sales to optimize the supply chain among many distributed machines. It could also be used to optimize the efficiency of the personnel who replenish the inventory in the machines and perform unscheduled mechanical maintenance. Phase 2: Designing the proof-of-concept prototype The project team determined that, for this project to be as useful as possible for the developer community, it should be based on readily available parts and technologies. Based on that decision, it was decided to limit the bill of materials to the Grove* IoT Commercial Developer Kit, Intel® IoT Developer Kit, and Intel® IoT Gateway Software Suite (https://software.intel.com/en-us/iot/hardware/gateways/wind-river), using software technologies that are widely used in the industry and available at low or no cost, with the use of free open-source software (FOSS) wherever practical. To accelerate the prototype stage and reduce its complexity, the team elected to build the local portion of the prototype as a bench model that would consist of the compute platform and sensors, without incorporating an actual vending machine, although such a device would be added at a future stage of the project. Prototype hardware selection The Intel® NUC Kit DE3815TYKHE small-form-factor PC was chosen for this project. This platform is pictured in Figure 2, and its high-level specifications are given in Table 1. In addition to its robust performance, the team felt that, as Intel’s most recently introduced hardware platform specifically targeting IoT, it was a forward-looking choice for this demonstration project. Based on the Intel® Atom™ processor E3815, the Intel NUC offers a fanless thermal solution, 4 GB of onboard flash storage (and SATA connectivity for additional storage), as well as a wide range of I/O. The Intel NUC is conceived as a highly compact and customizable device that provides capabilities at the scale of a desktop PC. To simplify the process of interfacing with sensors, the team elected to take advantage of the Arduino* ecosystem using the Arduino* 101 board, also shown in Figure 2, with specifications given in Table 1. This board makes the Intel NUC both hardware and pin compatible with Arduino shields, in keeping with the open-source ideals of the project team. While Bluetooth* is not used in the current iteration of the project, the board does have that functionality, which the team is considering for future use. Figure 2.

This collection of components is available at low cost, and because it is a pre-selected set of parts, it reduces the effort required to identify and procure the bill of materials for IoT prototypes in general. Selection of sensors and other components for the prototype (detailed in the following section) are guided by the following key data: Internal temperature of the machine Inventory levels of each vendable item in the machine Door open or closed status Detection of a jam in the vending coil Prototype software specification For the prototype OS, the team considered Yocto Linux* as well as the Intel® IoT Gateway Software Suite. Yocto Linux supports the project’s ideal of using free open-source software (FOSS), and it offers a high degree of flexibility, as well as robust control over the source code and the ability to create a custom lightweight embedded OS that is tailored to the needs of the system. Intel IoT Gateway Software Suite, on the other hand, provides an out-of-the-box implementation, without requirements for customization. The team identified this combination of factors as a best practice for prototype development, and so Intel IoT Gateway Software Suite was chosen as the OS for the prototype. The following applications were identified to be developed as part of the solution: Control application will run on the vending machine itself, gathering data from sensors and handling operation of the electromechanical aspects of the solution (e.g., turning the vending coils) as well as data exchange with both human users (e.g., customers and administrators) and with the cloud. Administration application will operate on a PC or tablet and allow for a detailed view into the operation of the vending machine, including events, status, and logs, as well as access to the cloud data and analytics. This application will also support regular maintenance. Customer application will operate on a smartphone or other mobile device, enabling a customer to purchase products from the machine. Phase 3: Building and refining the proof-of-concept prototype Using the Intel NUC Kit DE3815TYKHE, the Arduino 101 board, and the Grove Starter Kit Plus IoT Edition, the team developed the proof of concept prototype illustrated in Figure 3 to simulate a simple vending machine that dispenses two products. It includes a 2x16-character LCD display that shows product names and price information, as well as two product selection buttons, a step motor to dispense products, and two LEDs (green and red) to show the machine status. It also includes a temperature sensor and a "fault detection" button. Once the buy button on the customer application is pressed, the product is dispensed; for simplicity, payment processing hardware was left out of the prototype. Figure 3. Intelligent vending machine proof of concept prototype. Prototype Hardware Implementation The bill of materials for the prototype is summarized in Table 2. Table 2. Intelligent vending machine prototype components.   Component Details Base System Intel® NUC Kit DE3815TYKHE http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/boards-and-kits/intel-nuc-kits/intel-nuc-kit-de3815tykhe.html Arduino* 101 Board https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoard101 USB Type A to Type B Cable For connecting Arduino 101 board to NUC Components from Grove* Starter Kit Plus IoT Edition Base Shield V2 http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Base-Shield-V2-p-1378.html Gear Stepper Motor with Driver http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Gear-Stepper-Motor-with-Driver-p-1685.html Button Module http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Grove-Button-p-766.html Temperature Sensor Module http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Grove-Temperature-Sensor-p-774.html Green LED http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Grove-Green-LED-p1144.html Red LED http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Grove-Red-LED-p-1142.html LCD with RGB Backlight Module http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Grove-LCD-RGB-Backlight-p-1643.html Touch Sensor http://seeedstudio.com/depot/Grove-Touch-Sensor-p-747.html Prototype Software Implementation The control application used in the proof of concept prototype was written in C++. It also uses a Node.js component for accessing the Azure cloud. The cloud is used to exchange events with the mobile and administration applications. Such events include for example, temperature alerts and product dispense requests. The mobile application was written in JavaScript* for use in a web browser, to avoid the necessity of migrating the application to multiple smartphone platforms. The development environment used to develop the software for this solution was Intel® System Studio, a plug-in for the Eclipse* IDE that facilitates connecting to the NUC and developing applications in C/C++. In addition, the development of this solution used Libmraa, a C/C++ library that allows for direct access to I/O on the NUC, as well as Firmata, which allows for programmatic interaction with the Arduino development environment, taking advantage of Arduino’s hardware abstraction capabilities. Abstracting Firmata using Libmraa enables greater programmatic control of I/O on the NUC, simplifying the process of gathering data from sensors. UPM provides the specific function calls that are used to access sensors. Phase 4: Producing a Solid Beta Version With a proof of concept prototype up and running, the team turned its attention to creating the production version of the intelligent vending machine. The solution as a whole was conceived as including the following main parts: Vending machine, which dispenses products and communicates data back through the gateway. This part of the solution is complex and custom-built, including a variety of sensors and related components. Gateway, which is purchased as a commercial product based on Intel architecture and implemented using custom-developed software. Administration and Customer application, implemented in JavaScript, which is used to control the solution as a whole and to generate and access cloud-based analytics. Cloud analytics, based on Microsoft Azure, which allow for the development of insights to improve business processes, based on usage data from the vending machine over time. Selecting Vending Machine Components An early effort in the completion phases of the project involved selecting the specific components that would make up the final solution in production. Vending Machine Device Procurement Whereas the team had elected to create the proof of concept prototype as a board-level simulation of a vending machine, the production version was to be an actual, functioning vending machine. The team investigated having a custom machine purpose built, as well as purchasing a used machine that could be retrofitted for the purposes of this project. Ultimately, a custom machine was selected in order to support selling the widest possible range of products. The initial specification for the custom vending machine and a picture of the machine itself at an early stage of fabrication are shown in Figure 4. Figure 4. Vending machine specification and photo of device during fabrication. Vending Machine Model Specification Custom tabletop vending machine for a variety of small products packed in boxes, blister packs, or bags. Each of three coil-driven vend trays will be configured for a different size product: 3" close pitch coil for 12-14 small blister packs 4" medium pitch coil for 9-12 medium size boxes or packages large 5-6" coil for 6-8 larger packages such as t-shirts The coils will be driven from one stepper motor per coil and drop product in to a singlewide tray at the bottom of the machine. There will be a plexi-window to view vend selections and optional cutouts for Intel choice of flatscreen and/or keypad. Machine body will be powder-coated steel, trays will be aluminum, and vend coils will be plated steel. Front of machine will open to refill product, and rear will open to install and service vending mechanism. Approximate dimensions of machine will be 24-30" deep x 36" tall x 30" wide. Overall target weight is under 70lbs. Customer applications allows for purchasing products. Other key decisions to be made at this stage included the choice of industrial-grade sensors, an Intel® architecture-based commercial gateway, a fully supported production OS, a cloud service for data storage and analytics, and software technologies for the administration and customer application. Sensors and Related Components Selection Industrial-grade sensors and related components to replace those from the Grove Starter Kit that were used in the proof of concept prototype are detailed in Table 3.

Ready commercial availability was clearly needed so the project could proceed on schedule. While some members of the team expressed preference for the Vantron VT-M2M-QK gateway, difficulty in obtaining that device in a timely manner disqualified it from use in the project. Ultimately, the Dell iSeries Wyse 3290 IoT Gateway, specifications of which are summarized in Table 4, was chosen for implementation in the product phase of this project. That gateway provides the needed performance for present and foreseeable functionality, as well as ready availability (potentially in large quantities) for hypothetical distribution of the vending machine as a commercial product. Table 4. Gateway specifications for intelligent vending machine product phase.   Dell iSeries Wyse* 3290 IoT Gateway Processor Intel® Celeron® processor N2807 (1 M cache, up to 2.16 GHz) Memory 4 GB DDR3 RAM 1600 MHz Networking LAN: 1 x 10/100/1000 BASE-T WLAN: 802.11a/b/g/n/ac PAN: Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy Physical Specifications Dimensions: 69mm x 197.5mm x 117mm Weight: 2.34kg Continuing to use Intel IoT Gateway Software Suite (which the prototype was already based on) was a straightforward decision, particularly because the gateway is pre-validated for that OS. Moreover, Intel NUCs and gateways can both run Intel IoT Gateway Software Suite, simplifying the process of porting software elements from the prototype to the product version of the intelligent vending machine model. Likewise, the other core software components such as Intel System Studio and the libraries used in the prototype were held constant to simplify the transition to the product phase. Online Operation The system includes the software running on the IoT gateway, the Azure cloud, and a server-side application, as illustrated in Figure 5. Figure 5. Intelligent vending machine topology: online operation. IoT Gateway Software Implementation The IoT gateway software consists of three parts: Control application is implemented in C++ using the IoT Developer Kit libraries libmraa and libupm; it performs the following tasks: Check for mechanical failures and report failure/no-failure events to the local database. Monitor for temperature fluctuations in and out of the allowed range, reporting events when the temperature goes out of and returns to that range. Check for events from product selection buttons that occur in the customer application, followed by the application generating a "dispense" event, which is sent to the machine through the cloud. Local DB is used for inter-process communication between the control application and the DB daemon. The local SQLite database uses the file $HOME/Vending_Prototype/events.sqlite3, which contains the "events" table with the events to be reported to the cloud. The events table is replicated both ways to and from the machine. DB daemon is implemented using Node.js; it sends reported events bi-directionally between the local database and the cloud. Azure Cloud Implementation The Azure cloud maintains information about product inventory for the intelligent vending machine, keeps track of the events received from customer app and vending machine, and provides functionality to analyze this data and trigger responses to various conditions (e.g., low inventory or mechanical failure). Primary cloud analytics functions are as follows: If a product is out of stock, that information is sent to the cloud and an alert displays in the admin app for the user. If the vending machine internal temperature reaches above or below a preset threshold, that information is sent to the cloud for analysis. An alert displays in the admin app for the user. If any of the three vending machine coils function improperly, that information is sent to cloud for analysis. An alert displays in the admin app for the user. If the vending machine tray is pulled out, "Machine Opened" status displays red in LCD and LED. Once the tray is pushed back in, "Machine is ready" status displays green in LCD and LED. The Admin app provides information regarding home, setup, log history, inventory status and alert details. Phase 5: Finalizing Design and Releasing to Production The project team tasked with developing this solution was engineering-centric, and so producing first-rate UIs for the final product was somewhat outside the team’s core competency. Therefore, the team engaged an external resource on a contract basis for that purpose. The UI provider participated in regular team meetings and dedicated meetings with the core software-development team. During those discussions, the UIs were refined to incorporate additional capabilities and functionality. For example, the team added color coding and options for switching between Fahrenheit and Celsius temperatures to the administration application UI. Functionality was added to the customer application UI asking users to verify that they wish to make the purchase before the transaction is made, along with other minor refinements. Admin Application The administration application UI, shown in Figure 6, is designed to operate on a tablet computer and to provide administrative functionality on the intelligent vending machine. Figure 6. Intelligent vending machine administration application UI. The administration application UI incorporates the following primary elements: Menu system contains a "home" button to go the home screen (shown in the figure), an "About" screen with information about the software, a "Setup" button that provides hardware-setup details (including placement and connectivity of sensors), a "Log" button to access an events log that tracks purchases, alerts, and maintenance, and an "Alert" button that provides information about active maintenance alerts, including the type and time of occurrence for each alert. Inventory panel reflects inventory levels that are set within the cloud, using color coding to indicate those levels: dark blue for levels above two thirds of capacity, lighter blue for levels one third to two thirds, and orange for levels below one third. Clicking on the panel generates a detailed inventory window that displays exact inventory quantities, which tray the item is in, and price for each item. Temperature module is a dual-threshold radial temperature graph, with display of the machine’s current internal temperature selectable as Fahrenheit or Celsius. The white bar represents the acceptable temperature range; if the temperature goes outside that range, the system generates an alert. The software polls the temperature and updates the UI every few seconds. Coil status module reports on the status of the vending coils and motors, indicating if there is any malfunction, such as a jam or electrical failure. Vending unit module provides visual information about the presence and location of error conditions, as well as the door open/closed status. Customer Application The customer application, shown in Figure 7, is designed to operate on a mobile device, allowing customers to interact with the vending machine in order to make a purchase. Figure 7. Intelligent vending machine customer application. The customer application incorporates the following primary elements: Status pane indicates whether the machine is ready for an order to be made, and it also functions as a shopping cart to display a list of items selected by the user, pending sale. When items are added to the shopping cart, a "Buy" button appears that indicates the sale total; clicking on that button completes the purchase by sending the order information to the cloud and upon receipt of confirmation from the cloud, dispensing the item and updating the inventory number. Ordering pane contains a selection button for each product in the machine; when clicked, the button adds the item to the shopping cart list in the status pane. Each product button is accompanied by fields that display the amount of inventory in stock as well as the price of the item. Completed Production Vending Machine The assembled intelligent vending machine, with the gateway, sensors, and other components installed, is shown in Figure 9. Figure 9. Fully assembled intelligent vending machine. Phase 6: Evaluating Functionality and Adding Features Once the actual product version of the vending machine was operational, several team members began to identify possible future functionality that could be built into the product. Enhancing Cloud Analytics The team identified the opportunity to enhance cloud-analytics functionality using the Microsoft Power BI service and Power BI Desktop, a cloud-hosted business intelligence and analytics service that is integrated into Microsoft Azure. These capabilities offer data-visualization enhancements for the intelligent vending solution. Enhancing Event Notification Data Flows During the evaluation phase, the team identified possibilities to automate certain aspects of the machine’s operation using event notifications in conjunction with Azure analytics. Specifically, future enhancements based on the following data flows were identified: Inventory. If the quantity of a product drops to two units, a future enhancement could cause a notification to be sent to the cloud for analysis, and an alert could be sent to the administration application as a notification to reorder stock. This sequence could be repeated if the quantity drops to zero, and notification could also be sent to the machine display and the mobile application, indicating that the item is out of stock. Maintenance. If the machine malfunctions (e.g., the coil fails to make a full turn, the temperature goes outside preset limits, etc.), a future enhancement could cause a notification to be sent to the cloud for analysis, and service personnel could be notified. An alert could also be sent to the administration application to monitor the status of the service call. Conclusion Tracing the path to product during the development of the intelligent vending machine is intended as a pattern for teams to consider as they build their own solutions. Beginning with an ideation phase and rapid prototyping on low-cost equipment and a simplified physical model allows projects to take off quickly. Decisions can therefore be made early about the potential viability of the project, when a relatively small investment in time and money has been made. This project also suggests a model for thinking about cloud analytics in IoT solutions. Rather than focusing just on opportunities for big-data insights, this implementation reveals how the cloud can function foremost as a communication nexus and centralized data store. At the same time, the cloud data provides substantial opportunities for generating business intelligence to optimize supply chains, increase maintenance efficiency, and enhance profitability.

These articles are intended to provide you with information on products and services that we consider useful and of value to developers. Get access to the new Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution that allows developers to create exciting new solutions with the Intel® Galileo and Intel® Edison boards. Visit the Intel® Developer Zone for IoT. Summary This project is about a simple obstacle avoiding robot using Intel® Edison module. Robotics is an exciting and fun hobby that has become very affordable in recent years. Lets do it. Parts List Cardboard. Battery. Ball bearing for front roller. 2 servo motors. 2 matching wheels. Intel Edison with Arduino breakout board. Breadboard. Ultrasonic Range sensor – HC-SR04. Capacitors (220uF). Jumper Wires,rubber bands,Glues, etc… Steps To Be Followed Step 1: Chassis We chose a simple cardboard based chassis with the servos attached to it with the help of rubber bands. Make it convenient for your use. The above choices work as long as your rover is roving over smooth surfaces. Attach the front ball bearing in front of the cardboard. Set front wheel ball bearing: Attach single servo motor: Attach both servo motors: our chassis is ready. Step 2: Arduino Board With Intel Edison Configure your arduino board with intel edison. Look at this link to configure (https://software.intel.com/en-us/iot/library/edison-getting-started). Make sure your serial communiction and port are fixed. Check out your arduino board with intel edison by loading a simple program to your board. Let's check out our board with simple blinking led. Step 3: Battery And Board Mount this battery using battery holder and board then later secure it to the chassis using rubber bands – surprisingly this works pretty well (remember this is planned on using this on smooth surfaces only – adjust the attach according to your plans). We have to use 6 AA battery holder in order to hold six batteries (based on motors you can use your batteries). Step 4: Arduino Pins These are the ARDUINO PINS which it is attached for this project. You can set the pins on your own. Ultrasonic Range Sensor (HC-SR04) ECHO 9 Ultrasonic Range Sensor (HC-SR04) TRIG 10 Servo signal (left) 5 Servo signal (right) 6 Step 5: Ultrasonic Range Sensor (HC-SR04) First of all check Ultrasonic Range Sensor (HC-SR04) by using a simple arduino code. Connect the ultra sonic sensor using some jumper wires. Here we have checked our ultra sonic sensor using simple program. By checking in serial port of arduino uno we can have a clear thought that it is working. Ultrasonic sensor shows the distance of the object in front of it. Here in our code distance is calculated in centimeter. Below image shows the distance calculated by ultrasonic sensor in serial port (cm). Step 6: Servo Motor Connections The wiring needed for connecting the servo cable — 3 pin connection coming out from the servo – red (vcc), black(ground) and in my case yellow(signal). The picture (Servo wiring 1) shows the 220uF capacitor connected between vcc/ground – this is needed for each servo in order to avoid the brownout issues. Since we are using the same battery source to power the servos and the board. on sudden rover turn of directions, there can be spikes of current draw which can cause the board to recycle if we don’t provide a sizeable capacitor (220uF works just fine in our case). The pictures show wiring for 1 servo without the servo cable attached (Servo wiring 1) with the servo cable attached (Servo wiring 2) and then both the servo cables attached. Step 7: Coding And Testing Apply the code and test it. #include<Servo.h>
#define trigpin 10 // Trigger pin
#define echopin 9 // echo pin

Servo servoLeft;
Servo servoRight;

int forward = 180;
int backward = 0;

void setup() {
Serial.begin(9600);
servoLeft.attach(5);
servoRight.attach(6);

pinMode(trigpin, OUTPUT);
pinMode(echopin, INPUT);

}

void loop ()
{
int duration, distance;
servoRight.write(forward);
servoLeft.write(forward);

digitalWrite(trigpin, HIGH);
delayMicroseconds(1000);
digitalWrite(trigpin, LOW);
duration = pulseIn(echopin, HIGH);

distance = ( duration / 2) / 29.1;

delay(1000);
if (distance >= 10)
{
Serial.print(distance);
Serial.println(&rdquo; cm&rdquo;);
}
else
{
Serial.println(&ldquo;danger&rdquo;);
servoLeft.write(90);
servoRight.write(90);
delay(1000);

servoLeft.write(backward);
servoRight.write(forward);
delay(5000);
servoLeft.write(forward);
servoRight.write(forward);

}

} Now we have done. Here is our simple obstacle avoiding robot using intel edison.

This solution monitors the temperature within a truck’s refrigerated cargo area, as well the open or closed status of the cargo doors. The gateway generates events based on changes to those statuses, to support end-user functionality on a tablet PC application. Editorial Note This article is for our sponsors at CodeProject. These articles are intended to provide you with information on products and services that we consider useful and of value to developers Get access to the new Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution that allows developers to create exciting new solutions with the Intel® Galileo and Intel® Edison boards. Visit the Intel® Developer Zone for IoT. To demonstrate a rapid path-to-product edge IoT solution for the transportation sector, a proof of concept was created using the Grove* IoT Commercial Developer Kit. That prototype was scaled to an industrial solution using an Intel® IoT Gateway, industrial sensors, and Intel® System Studio. This solution monitors the temperature within a truck’s refrigerated cargo area, as well the open or closed status of the cargo doors. The gateway generates events based on changes to those statuses, to support end-user functionality on a tablet PC application. Figure 1. The finished product demonstration with custom trailer housing. The core opportunity associated with the Internet of Things (IoT) lies in adding intelligence and connectivity to everyday devices, harnessing information and putting it to use in ways that add value. Monitoring the status of a refrigerated semi-truck trailer hauling perishable goods is a simple example. Alerting the driver when the temperature passes outside a pre-set range or when cargo doors are opened unexpectedly can help avoid financial losses. An IoT solution to monitor and track these aspects of a semi-truck trailer could therefore be a viable commercial product. Intel undertook a development project to investigate this and other opportunities associated with building a connected transportation solution. The project was presented as a demonstration at Intel® Developer Forum in 2015 and again in 2016. This document recounts the course of the project development effort, to help drive inquiry, invention, and innovation for the Internet of Things. For a how to for this project, see IoT Path-to-Product: How to Build a Connected Transportation Solution. Visit GitHub for this project's latest code samples and documentation. Introduction The goal of this project was to build a functional prototype and then to transition that proof of concept into an industrial-grade solution for scalable deployment as a commercial product. Rapid prototyping is facilitated by using the Grove* IoT Commercial Developer Kit, which consists of an Intel® NUC system, Intel® IoT Gateway Software Suite, and sensors and their components from the Grove* Starter Kit Plus (manufactured by Seeed). The project also uses the Arduino* 101 board. Hardware used in the prototype stage of this project is illustrated in Figure 1, and specifications are given in Table 1. Note: Known in the United States as "Arduino* 101," this board is known elsewhere as "Genuino* 101." It is referred to throughout the rest of this document as the "Arduino* 101" board. Table 1.

Intel® NUC Kit DE3815TYKHE and Arduino* 101 board. The course of this project demonstrates the value of the path-to-product approach: it allows a prototype to be built with a relatively small investment of time and effort, followed by an efficient transition to a commercially viable solution. Using a precompiled OS as well as RPMs helps to eliminate unnecessary downloads, having to customize the OS, and identifying libraries necessary to bring a project to life. This project was devised to contribute to innovations around solutions for similar use cases being produced and marketed. While this project was designed to provide only basic functionality, its design is flexible and extensible enough that a variety of features could be added. In particular, the project could be expanded in the future to include web connectivity, cloud capabilities, remote monitoring, and other components. In the project’s earliest stages, the team listed potential features for the prototype and the product. A sample of these included rear-door status (open or closed), temperature of the trailer, alarms based on the state of the door and temperature, an online application to view data, and in-cab monitoring of information. To demonstrate the viability of creating a robust solution while maintaining simplicity and low cost, the team elected to limit the bill of materials for the prototype phase to just the contents of the Grove IoT Commercial Developer Kit. Creating the Prototype Proof of Concept To allow for separation of duties and efficient progress, the team divided the solution into three primary areas of effort: User interface (UI). Part of the team began working on the actual production UI layout and design, looking ahead to the production stages of the project. Application business logic. Part of the team began working on the logic for the prototype application, while also recognizing that changes would be needed as the project progressed toward the commercial solution. Prototype sensor solution. Part of the team began to create the configuration of sensors for the solution, utilizing the UPM/MRAA libraries for rapid development. This approach of separating the project into discrete segments allowed the team to progress through the prototype phase more rapidly than otherwise, taking best advantages of skill sets available within the team. In particular, while the user interface was not strictly required in the early phases of the project, it was expected to require the most development time of the three areas listed above. Therefore, so beginning it as early as possible allowed for it to be well underway by the time it was needed later in the project. In terms of the application logic, the team was able to look ahead to the expected final functional prototype and make decisions in the early prototype process looking to the future. Overall, the team expected the operation of the door sensor to be relatively simple, allowing greater attention to the proper utilization of a temperature sensor on a small and then commercial scale. By utilizing the sensors in the Grove* Starter Kit Plus, we were able to rapidly create a prototype with a functional sensor environment that the UI team could work with. This approach enabled layout and design elements to come to life quickly and provided a future framework for the final functional use case. The prototype configuration, with the Intel® NUC, Arduino* 101 board, and sensors, is illustrated in Figure 3. The bill of materials is given in Table 2. Figure 3.

Solid red LED lights up in cab. LCD displays current temperature and door status (open), as shown in Figure 4. Figure 4. Showing door status. Touch temperature sensor to raise ambient room temperature by five degrees: Buzzer sounds. Red LED blinks continuously.

Press button to close the door: Red LED continues to blink until temperature passes below threshold. LCD displays temperature and door status (closed). When temperature passes below threshold, blinking red LED turns off, solid green LED lights up, and LCD turns green. LCD displays temperature and door status (closed). Simulation This simulation demonstrates the reduced potential loss of temperature-sensitive cargo by monitoring temperature changes and alerting the driver if it becomes critical, as illustrated in Figures 6 and 7. Figure 6. Log file showing events. Figure 7. Base online view as envisioned. Target Commercial Solution With an operational prototype based on the Intel® IoT Developer Kit and Grove IoT Commercial Developer Kit, it was necessary to determine how to proceed to create a commercial solution. Table 3 outlines how the components used in the prototype phase could be transitioned to a production solution. Table 3. Components in prototype versus production solution.   Prototype Production Solution Buzzer Grove Kit Buzzer Alarm on Phone (customer application) LCD Grove LCD panel Screen on Phone (customer application) LED (RED) Grove Kit LED Light on Phone (customer application) Button Grove Kit Button Industrial magnetic sensor with paired magnet Touch Sensor Grove Kit Touch Sensor Touch on Phone (customer application) Temp Sensor Grove Kit Temp Sensor Commercial Temp Sensor Heat Source Person’s Finger 20-watt Halogen Puck Light Gateway Intel® NUC and Arduino 101 Board Intel® IoT Gateway In addition, there are many commercial gateways available, with design differences making them suited to various industries and use cases. A key consideration for this project was a broad range of I/O options, to support both current and future functionality, specifically for connecting sensors to provide a data feed. An Intel® IoT Gateway was chosen as the gateway device for the product portion of this project, as shown in Figure 8. The processing power and I/O functions were deemed sufficient for the presented commercial usage. A wired Modbus temperature sensor was chosen to provide a reliable connection to obtain temperature readings every several seconds. All communications on devices were performed via direct wiring or via Ethernet. Standard MRAA/UPM libraries were maintained throughout the process without any modifications. The gateway acts as a web server, storing data as well as making calls to the temperature sensor to keep the data fresh. The Java UPM Library uses libmodbus to read and send periodic updates from the Comet* temperature sensor to the Tomcat* web server. Figure 8. Gateway installed as part of demo with temperature sensor. Transferring Code to the Gateway Typically, ramping up to a commercial gateway involves having to revamp code so that it is compatible with whichever services are available on the system. In this case, the coding on the prototype was all performed in Java*, HTML, and JavaScript*, making the transition to a commercial solution relatively simple. The code transition was simplified by the use of the same MRAA/UPM libraries in both phases of the project. Mapping Grove Sensors to Industrial Sensors Using MRAA and UPM libraries can help jumpstart a project. The following steps cover porting the app to the commercial product solution: Target desired industrial hardware: Determine whether the hardware requires additional libraries or application support. If needed, integrate libraries and software and create OS layers for software deployment. Once commercial product hardware is successfully integrated into the prototype solution, remove the code that is no longer needed: Utilize existing layers created during the prototype phase to install solution dependencies. Make changes as needed for new hardware. Take new and old layers and build into production runtime. Complete all installation and testing on production hardware. Customer Application The base customer application, shown in Figures 9 through 12, was created to replace the functionality of the Grove LCD, LED, buzzer, and touch sensor that the driver would interact with. In the production solution, the customer application would reside on the mobile device carried by the driver, allowing for easy notification and response to alerts. The customer application is quite simple in this example but could be easily expanded. It has two status indicators that refer to temperature and door status. An alert button becomes active and then gives an acknowledge button to clear the alert. Figure 9. Main status screen. Figure 10. Status showing an alert. Figure 11. Showing a full alert and acknowledge button active. Figure 12. Initial setup screen finding IP address of gateway. Conclusion This exercise demonstrates use of the Grove* IoT Commercial Developer Kit to rapidly develop a prototype. With wide-ranging libraries, the ease of use of the Developer Kit simplifies the development process while also providing high compatibility for commercialization of the product. Scaling up to a commercial gateway was quite easy, as the team was able to directly copy code and have it function immediately.

Editorial Note This article is in the Product Showcase section for our sponsors at CodeProject. These articles are intended to provide you with information on products and services that we consider useful and of value to developers. Get access to the new Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution that allows developers to create exciting new solutions with the Intel® Galileo and Intel® Edison boards. Visit the Intel® Developer Zone for IoT. The Arduino 101*/Genuino 101* board is the first development board to be powered by Intel® Curie™ technology. It counts with the same peripheral list and controllers as the Arduino* UNO board. Sharing the same physical shape and pin layout as the UNO board, the Arduino 101 board accepts many of the shields that fit in its predecessor; you can also interchange cases and mounts between the two boards. The Arduino board has a dual-core x86 32-bit Intel® Quark™ processor, which allows for multithreaded applications and enables the use of powerful peripherals that the UNO board did not support. The board’s operating voltage is 3.3 V input/output (I/O), with 5 V tolerance, meaning that you can also connect 5 V components. It has 20 general-purpose I/O (GPIO) pins: 14 digital I/O pins and 6 pins for analog-to-digital conversion (ADC). It is equipped with four pulse width modulation (PWM) pins and three channel logic converters connected to the GPIO pins. The Arduino 101 board has an in-circuit serial programming header with serial peripheral interface (SPI) signals that you can use to access microcontrollers and I2C dedicated pins. With a built-in six-axis accelerometer, gyroscope, and Bluetooth* low energy (Bluetooth* LE), you can easily create Internet of Things (IoT) apps that allow you to use your smartphone to control your board (Figure 1). Figure 1. Arduino 101* board with Intel® Curie™ technology ADC and PWM So, what does all this mean? To understand ADC and PWM, you first need to take a closer look at analog and digital signals. For components to communicate, they must send signals—think of them as messages—that reflect a change of state in a given time. In electronics, the quantity being measured is voltage. How the change takes place is what differentiates these two types of signals. You can represent signals (change in voltage over time) in graphs: Analog signals are shown as smooth, continuous waves given that the transition in voltage is gentle, while digital signals are represented in square waves where there is an "on" (5 V) or "off" (0 V) state only (Figure 2). Figure 2. Digital (squared) and analog (smooth) signals Most communication between integrated circuits is digital, and ADC allows microcontrollers to read signals from analog devices. Conversely, digital-to-analog conversion allows the microcontroller to generate an analog signal and communicate with the analog interface. PWM comes into play when you want to control the time variable in a digital signal, allowing for a longer on or off state. The amount of time the signal is on (5 V) is known as duty cycle. Figure 3 provides a graph representation of various duty cycles. You can alter the time unit to have the on state for a longer or shorter period. The bigger the duty cycle percentage, the longer the LED will be lit and so reducing the time the LED is off (0 V). PWM can be demonstrated using an LED; a common example is the fade effect, where by switching the on and off state very fast, you can mimic analog behavior. Remember that in analog waves, the transition between on and off is smoother; therefore, to the observer, the LED will seem to fade. In a digital setup, the change is more abrupt, and you will only see the LED rapidly switching between on and off. PWM allows the LED to trick your eye by making it seem as if it’s fading even when using digital signals. On an RGB LED (composed of one red, one green, and one blue LED), each color can be represented at a different percentage, which affects the light’s overall color. If you have green and blue at a 50 percent duty cycle (equal quantities) while red is at 0 percent, the light generated will be teal. Figure 3. LEDs whose pulse width modulation is set at 50 percent, 25 percent, and 100 percent duty cycles, respectively Serial Communication: Interintegrated Circuit, SPI, and Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter The Arduino 101 board uses serial communication between its microcontrollers and peripherals. In serial systems, you can send only 1 bit at a time, while in parallel communications, you send multiple bits. You can think of serial as a single-lane road and parallel as a multilane highway. SPI and interintegrated circuit (I2C) are serial buses that communicate through digital signals. Think of a bus as a road for data transpiration: Its purpose is to allow communication between multiple master–slave chips, where one device acts as the controller (master) while others are being controlled (slaves; see Figure 4). The board uses I2C for communication with slower, on-board peripherals that it accesses occasionally. It only requires 2 wires to have up to 127 devices, where each receives a unique identifier that the master uses to recognize its slaves. I2C can read and write data from and to many sensors. Synchronous systems require a clock to ensure that the data is written and read at the correct tempo. The master defines which device is performing which action (read/write). The serial clock (SCL) wire provides the clock signal that the master generates, which synchronizes the data transfer between the devices on the I2C bus. The serial data (SDA) is the second wire, and it carries the data flowing through the bus. Because of its simplicity and being a low-bandwidth protocol, it’s a great option for infrequently accessed devices, but it’s slower than SPI. Figure 4. Interintegrated circuit master–slave bus with serial data and serial clock lines. SPI allows one master and one or multiple slaves using four signal types. Think of them as four channels (lines) of communications between the masters and slaves: Master-out-slave-in (MOSI). Carries data from master to slave (data line) Master-in-slave-out (MISO). Carries data from the slave to the master (data line) Serial-clock (SCLK). Clock signal that synchronizes the system Slave-select line (SS_). Used to select and enable the slave on the bus; notifies the slave that it should wake up and send or receive data You can set up SPI in two ways. If all slaves share the same slave-select line, SPI requires a minimum of four wires (MOSI, MISO, SCLK, SS_). Another option is to give each slave have its own SS_ line to connect to the master; here, you need an additional wire per slave. Figure 5 summarizes these two setups. Figure 5. A serial peripheral interface with one shared slave-select line (SS_) versus each slave with its own SS_ line When contrasting I2C and SPI, you should also understand the concept of full duplex and half-duplex. Full-duplex communication is where two parties (slave and master in this context) can send data at the same time. In half-duplex communication, one party has to wait until the other is done sending data. Taking a closer look, given that SPI is full duplex, it has an additional data wire compared to half-duplex I2C, where there is only one data line and it can’t send and receive data at the same time (Figure 6). Figure 6. Serial peripheral interface versus interintegrated circuit communication In asynchronous systems, there is no clock to dictate when the information is sent. Instead, the sender and receiver must agree on a speed (bit rate) at which the information will be communicated. If the sender is delivering at a faster rate, the receiver won’t be able to understand the data being sent because it will be processing it at a lower tempo. Therefore, it’s essential that you establish a bit rate to effectively use asynchronous communication. The Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART) is an asynchronous unit now commonly included in microcontrollers, and it acts as an intermediary between parallel and serial interfaces. It’s intended to have two connected devices, where the transmitter’s output, labeled Tx, is connected through a unidirectional data line to the receiver (Rx input; Figure 7). In this fashion, one UART takes bytes of data (1 byte = 8 bits) and transmits each individual bit through the Tx line to the receiving UART (Rx line). On the receiver end, the UART reassembles the bits, generating the byte that was originally sent. Figure 7. Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter send and receive bus Summary The Arduino 101 board is equipped with a broad array of pins, chips, and other devices that communicate by using synchronous and asynchronous methods. Complex, time-sensitive solutions have been designed to ensure that data is sent, received, and processed correctly.

Visit the Intel® Developer Zone for IoT. This project describes how to recognize certain types of human physical activities using acceleration data generated from the ADXL345 accelerometer connected to the Intel® Edison board. Human activity recognition has a wide range of applications especially in wearables. The data collected can be used monitoring patient activity, exercise patterns in athletes, fitness tracking and so on. We will be using support vector machine learning algorithm to achieve this. The project is implemented using the LIBSVM library and done separately in both Python and node.js. The set of activities to be recognized are running, walking, going up/down a flight of stairs and resting. We collect the accelerometer data over a set of intervals, extract the features which in this case are the acceleration values along the x,y and z axes. We then use this data for building a training model that will do the activity classification. The project code can be downloaded from here: Download Hardware Implementation. The diagram below shows the pin connection for the ADXL345 to the Intel® Edison board. Part 1. Python Implementation. Setting up LIBSVM Download the LIBSVM library and transfer the LibSVM zipped folder to the Intel® Edison board root directory using WINSCP. Then extract it by running: tar &ndash;xzf libsvm-3.21.tar.gz Run make in libsvm-3.21 directory Run make in libsvm-3.21/python directory Create the predict-activity.py python script in the libsvm-3.21/python directory Reading data from the ADXL345 accelerometer import pyupm_adxl345 as adxl345
# Create an I2C accelerometer object
adxl = adxl345.Adxl345(0)
while True:
    adxl.update() # Update the data
    raw = adxl.getRawValues() # Read raw sensor data
    force = adxl.getAcceleration() # Read acceleration force (g)
   
    forceX=format(force[0],'.2f')
    forceY=format(force[1],'.2f')
    forceZ=format(force[2],'.2f')

sleep(2) Classifying the various activities The training file contains instances of the various activities classified as; 0-walking 1-running/jogging 2-up/down staircase 3-resting Below is the screenshot of a small section of the training file Running a grid search to determine the best value for C The parameter C controls the tradeoff between errors of the SVM on training data and margin maximization. C is used during the training phase and says how much outliers are taken into account in calculating Support Vectors. from svmutil import *
import numpy as nu

param = svm_parameter("-q -h 0")
y, x = svm_read_problem('activity.ds')
problem = svm_problem(y[:100], x[:100])
results = []
for c in range(-10,20):
  for g in range(-10,5):
    param.C, param.gamma = 2**c, 2**g
    m = svm_train(problem,param)
    p_lbl, p_acc, p_val = svm_predict(y[100:],x[100:],m)
    results.append([param.C, param.gamma, p_acc[0]])

bestIdx = nu.argmax(nu.array(results)[:,2])

print results[bestIdx] Classifying various user activities #load the LIBSVM shared library:
from svmutil import *
#Construct an svm_problem instance where the activity.ds is the dataset with the training data
y, x = svm_read_problem('activity.ds')
where y is the tuple of labels representing the various activities and x is a tuple of data instances representing acceleration values from x,y and z axes

m = svm_train(y[0:], x[0:], '-c 0.03125 -h 0 -b 1 -q')
#y[0:] and x[0:] means we train the model on the whole dataset array from the first instance[0] to the last
#-h disable shrinking heuristics
#-c : set the cost parameter C of C-SVC
#-q: quiet mode (no outputs)

values=[[float(forceX),float(forceY), float(forceZ)]]
#forceX,forceY and forceZ are data instances of the accelerometer values in x,y,z axes

 p_labels,p_acc,p_values = svm_predict([0]*len(values),values,m])
#pass the accelerometer values for prediction in the svm_predict() method which returns 
#p_labels: a list of predicted labels   p_acc: a tuple including accuracy and p_values: a list of decision values or probability estimates (if '-b 1' is specified)
print p_labels
#output the predicted labels to represent the predicted activity Part 2. Node.Js Implementation Create a new project directory in the board’s home root folder and install node-svm: npm install node-svm Copy the build and lib folder from the node-modules/node-svm to the project directory. Next install the packages required by node-svm by running: npm install <package-name> The packages are Stringify-object, Mout, Graceful-fs, Optimist, Osenv, Numeric, Q and underscore. Reading data from the ADXL345 accelerometer Reading data from the ADXL345 accelerometer
var adxl345 = require('jsupm_adxl345');
var adxl = new adxl345.Adxl345(0);

setInterval(function()
{
    adxl.update(); // Update the data
    var raw = adxl.getRawValues(); // Read raw sensor data
    var force = adxl.getAcceleration(); // Read acceleration force (g)
    var rawvalues = raw.getitem(0) + " " + raw.getitem(1) + " " + raw.getitem(2);
    //console.log("Raw Values: " + rawvalues);
    var forceX=force.getitem(0).toFixed(2);
    var forceY=force.getitem(1).toFixed(2);
    var forceZ=force.getitem(2).toFixed(2);

}, 2000); We can now write the code to classify user activity using the value of c we determined from running the grid search using Python in part 1. var so = require('stringify-object');
var svm = require('./lib');
var numeric = require('numeric');
var fs = require('fs');
var fileName = './activity.ds';

//create the classifier
var clf = new svm.CSVC({
    c: 0.03125,
    normalize: false,
    reduce: false,
});

//Build the training model
svm.read(fileName)
    .then(function (dataset) {
        return clf.train(dataset)
            .progress(function (progress) {
                console.log('training progress: %d%', Math.round(progress * 100));
            });
    })
    .spread(function (model, report) {
        console.log('SVM trained. \nReport:\n%s', so(report));
    }).done(function () {
        console.log('done.');
    });

//Classify data instance at some interval
var prediction=clf.predictSync([forceX, forceY, forceZ]);
var probability=clf.predictProbabilitiesSync([forceX, forceY, forceZ]);
console.log(prediction); Summary The project covers how to determine the training parameters of the classifier using a grid search and running the classifier to be able to accurately predict various activities using LIBSVM in both Python and node.js. SVMs require a lot for processing power and memory; the Intel® Edison board delivers effectively on these requirements thus making the project a success. What will you make?

Understanding Wind River Helix Cloud Editorial Note This article is for our sponsors at CodeProject. These articles are intended to provide you with information on products and services that we consider useful and of value to developers Get access to the new Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution that allows developers to create exciting new solutions with the Intel® Galileo and Intel® Edison boards. Visit the Intel® Developer Zone for IoT. This article is part of a five-part series. Be sure to see the others: Understanding Wind River* Helix* Cloud Developing with Wind River* Helix* App Cloud Debugging with Wind River* Helix* Lab Cloud Deploying IoT Devices with Wind River* Helix* Device Cloud IoT Gateways and the Wind River* Helix* Cloud Understanding Wind River* Helix* Cloud Building applications for the Internet of Things is a complicated endeavor. Your development can span a variety of disciplines, including embedded firmware development, sensors and actuators, networking protocols, server-side application development, security, and manageability. That's a broad spectrum of engineering specializations, which could restrict IoT products to larger companies with dedicated teams. Thankfully, Wind River* has constructed a portfolio of IoT services that allow IoT developers to focus on their applications instead of the plethora of required enabling technologies. This IoT portfolio is made up of three key services and a number of technologies that enable fast time to market. A Tour of the Helix IoT Ecosystem Wind River's Helix Cloud is composed of a cooperating set of services that cover the lifecycle of IoT product development, test and deployment (see Figure 1). The App Cloud provides a cloud-based IDE for the development of firmware for IoT devices, including collaboration between two or more developers. This firmware can be tested on physical or virtual devices using the Lab Cloud, scaling to your testing needs. Finally, when your IoT device is ready to be deployed, the Device Cloud can be used for secure management and data transfer as well as overall device monitoring as your network of devices scales. Figure 1. The Helix IoT ecosystem. (IMAGE SOURCE: Author created.) Let's explore each of these services, and how they can be used to accelerate your IoT product development. Helix* App Cloud The App Cloud is a fully-featured development environment, built in the context of a web browser. This cloud-based development environment makes IoT firmware development possible anywhere there's a connection to the Internet. Figure 2 shows it running in the Google Chrome browser. Figure 2. Helix* App Cloud browser-based IDE. (IMAGE SOURCE: Author Captured Helix App Cloud Web Site Screenshot) As shown in Figure 2, the App Cloud is exposed as a fully-featured IDE in a web browser, with four panes. On the left is a file pane, showing the files that make up the workspace. At the top middle is the editor, showing a test application (C source file); tabs like the active one make multi-file editing simple and efficient. The right pane shows the debugger (currently executing the test application) with a list of control icons (for pausing execution and single-step debugging), the list of threads that are currently executing, the call stack, and an empty list of breakpoints. Finally, the bottom, middle pane contains a number of tabs for output, including the build tab and the output tab for the currently running application. Where this application executes is a topic for the next section. The power of the App Cloud is not just that you can access an IDE through a web browser anywhere there's an Internet connection. The power is in the IDE's connectivity to other services, such as the Lab Cloud. Helix* Lab Cloud While the App Cloud provides the means to build your IoT application, you'll need hardware (virtual or otherwise) to execute it. This is where the Lab Cloud comes in. The Helix* Lab Cloud is a cloud-based environment for debugging and testing your IoT applications. Using the Lab Cloud, you can attach to physical hardware resources (like the Intel® Edison board) or create and attach to virtual hardware resources. One virtual option is the QEMU x86 Intel® Quark™ simulator, which behaves identically to a physical processor. Your IoT application runs with complete transparency on the virtual platform as if it were a physical one. As a cloud-based service, the Lab Cloud also enables collaboration with other users, sharing physical and lower-cost virtual resources. Once your IoT application has been validated by one or more devices in the Lab Cloud, you can deploy your application to your target device of choice. From Figure 2, you can see a device from the Lab Cloud used for debugging the test application. In the upper right corner, you'll see green text with the name “TestDevice.” This is a virtual Intel® Quark x86 device that is online, as indicated by the green bubble. The debugger pane on the right is attached to this virtual device, as is the output pane connection (middle bottom) receiving console output from the application running on the virtual device. Figure 3 shows the web page for the Lab Cloud, and a short list of the platforms that are supported (hardware and RTOS). Figure 3. Helix Lab Cloud browser interface. (IMAGE SOURCE: Author Captured Helix Lab Cloud Website Screenshot) So far, we've seen how to develop and build our IoT application, as well as test it on physical or virtual devices. Now let's explore the deployment of our IoT devices, and how we can securely manage them in the field. Helix* Device Cloud The scale of IoT deployments can stress the traditional methods for device management. Managing a handful of devices is a trivial task, but once the set expands to hundreds, or hundreds of thousands of devices, more scalable methods are necessary. The Device Cloud is a cloud-based platform that can scale to your particular IoT deployment. It provides you with key capabilities, such as the ability to provision new devices, monitor their operation, manage them for configuration, securely capture data into the cloud, and decommission devices at the end of their lifecycle. The Device Cloud enables secure migration of data from your IoT devices into the cloud using end-to-end encryption for subsequent storage and analytics. It allows the development of rules for incoming telemetry data that can automatically trigger actions such as fault conditions or properties of the device. The Device Cloud also provides manageability and a number of other features, including firmware updates and integration with edge-device RTOS’s (such as Wind River* Linux*) along with health monitoring of devices using RESTful APIs. Additionally, the ability to configure devices in the field is enabled through RESTful APIs. The Device Cloud creates a seamless integration from the edge device into the cloud, allowing you to focus on developing your application, and reducing your overall time-to-market. Key benefits of the Helix* Cloud Accelerate your development with the App Cloud through anywhere and anytime access Provide instant test resource access to your team with the Lab Cloud and build new virtual device configurations on the fly Scale your IoT device deployment with the Device Cloud to provision, configure, monitor, and service Leverage Wind River* embedded operating systems (such as Rocket* and Pulsar*) with full integration with Helix* Cloud services. Leverage Intel® hardware designs for OS integration and seamless connectivity to the Helix Cloud services. Summary The Helix* Cloud provides you with an integrated set of services that cover the product lifecycle, from development and test, to deployment and analytics/monitoring. The Helix Cloud solves the common problems you'll encounter with device management, such as secure data delivery and robust management, allowing you to focus on your IoT application.

These articles are intended to provide you with information on products and services that we consider useful and of value to developers Get access to the new Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution that allows developers to create exciting new solutions with the Intel® Galileo and Intel® Edison boards. Visit the Intel® Developer Zone for IoT. The Intel® Edison board is a powerful, new, single-board computer capable of handling broad-spectrum of Internet of Things (IoT) applications, from small to reliable industrial projects. Using the JavaScript* framework Cylon.js*, you can control different robotic components easily in a web-based interface. To do so, you need a basic robot kit that has two direct-current (DC) motors controlled and powered only by the board: There’s no need for extra hardware, which makes the project easy to set up. Cylon.js has an easy syntax that helps you understand code without any prior knowledge of programming. It names the components based on their type, and generating commands need to work with the driver you use (for example, for your motor device, you need the turn_on and turn_off commands to make the robot move). This article is meant to help beginners understand the basic requirements for creating wireless controlled robots using the built in Wi-Fi module from the Intel® Edison board. To make sure that the board has enough power to supply the motors and the Wi-Fi module, connect it to a power supply of 7–15 V with 1,000 mA (1.0 A). To upload JavaScript code to the Intel® Edison board, you can use Intel® XDK IoT Edition. For details on how to set up the Intel® Edison board, see Getting started with the Intel® XDK IoT Edition. To upload the code that gives you control of your robot, use the Cylon.js HTTP application programming interface (API). This API is already implemented: You just have to call the function and let Cylon.js handle the rest. Board Setup Based on the robot kit you have (most of them have the same design), you need to make the same connections for both motors: GND - GND (on the Intel® Edison board) VCC - 5 V (on the Intel® Edison board) Forward Digital Pin (IB)* - Pin ~3 (PWM pin on the Intel® Edison board) Backward Digital Pin (IA)* - Pin ~5 (PWM pin on the Intel® Edison board) * The names of the pins can vary based on your robot kit. The pins you must connect to your Intel® Edison board to power the motor are shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. The pin connections on the Intel® Edison board Note: These pins power a single motor. You must do the same for the second motor, using pins ~6 and ~9 on your board. For this articles, you’ll use a robot kit equipped with two 5-V DC motors and a driver to control each. The motor has two pins to control each direction and two pins for GND and VCC (5-V pin on the board), as shown in Figure 2. It’s easy to find out where the pins go because every motor has the same setup. Figure 2. The four pins you must connect to your Intel® Edison board Controlling the Motors The Cylon.js HTTP API provides a means to control the motors directly from a web browser, making it easy to control the robot. You use a natural language to send commands to the specific pins, which means that you can prototype easily without having to write code. For this step to work, you must find the IP address that the Intel® Edison board uses to connect to your wireless router. For instructions, see Connecting your Intel® Edison board using Wi-Fi. After running the code from your integrated development environment, on the Intel® Edison board you should get the output shown in Figure 3. Figure 3. This output tells you which devices are connected and that the server is running. To control the motors connected to the board, access the corresponding link for the device you plan to control. By using the Cylon.js HTTP API, you can do so by entering the following URLs in your browser’s address bar. They use the names of the devices as listed in the console output in Figure 3, and each corresponds to a pin on the Intel® Edison board: To make the motor go forward, enter this URL: http://edison.local:3000/api/robots/tank/devices/motor_1_forward/commands/turn_on To make the motor go backward, enter this URL: http://edison.local:3000/api/robots/tank/devices/motor_1_forward/commands/turn_off. Now, based on your board configuration, you can stop and start the robot and make it move by replacing edison.local with the IP address you get from your board. (In Intel® XDK IoT Edition, you can see the IP address when you uploading the code—for example, 192.168.0.100): http://192.168.0.100:3000/api/robots/tank/devices/motor_1_forward/commands/turn_on http://192.168.0.100:3000/api/robots/tank/devices/motor_1_forward/commands/turn_off Summary After learning how to remotely control motors using the Cylon.js framework, you can easily extend your application to command different components by replacing the devices connected to your Intel® Edison board based on the examples from the Cylon.js documentation.

And here's why consumers might care this time. Speedy Thunderbolt ports will take off with next-gen PCs, Intel says 0 Computers by Stephen Shankland August 19, 2016 5:00 AM PDT @stshank Up Next Pokemon Go tracking finally goes live and actually works Enlarge Image "Anything you plug in, it's going support," says Jason Ziller, Intel's Thunderbolt marketing chief. Photo by Stephen Shankland/CNET Intel's long-running but largely unsuccessful effort to transform how you plug devices into your PC will make major progress this year and ultimately conquer much of the industry, the chipmaker predicts. Intel has promoted a connection technology called Thunderbolt for years with few signs of the mainstream success enjoyed by its chief rival, USB. At this week's Intel Developer Forum, though, the company offered two reasons why its high-speed connection technology will soon take off as a better way to hook storage systems, external displays and other peripherals to PCs. First is the arrival this fall of PCs powered by Intel's "Kaby Lake" seventh-generation Core processor. Those machines will include the new USB Type-C multipurpose port. Thunderbolt piggybacks on the same physical design, so it will be easier for PC makers to support Thunderbolt. "We're expecting more than double number of designs," up from 60 Thunderbolt-equipped PCs for sale today, said Jason Ziller, the Intel marketing director who's been the public face of Thunderbolt. "The marriage of USB-C and Thunderbolt is really driving a lot of that adoption." Second is Intel's belief that Thunderbolt will soothe compatibility headaches it expects will crop up with USB-C. Today's USB is pretty predictable, but not all new PCs and devices will support new USB abilities like high-power charging and video. If Intel is right, many more people could benefit as Thunderbolt boosts the usefulness and power of ordinary PCs, for example transforming a mainstream laptop into a powerful gaming system. Enlarge Image A single Thunderbolt cable lets an ordinary laptop use a poweful external graphics card and three external monitors at the Intel Developer Forum.Photo by Stephen Shankland/CNET If you're not familiar with Thunderbolt, think of it as a beefier version of USB, with faster data-transfer speeds and some extra abilities. But it's also a proprietary technology available only from Intel, not an industry standard like USB that's more likely to spread broadly and to cost less. The new Thunderbolt 3 version doubled its top speed in 2015, and this year Thunderbolt begins using the same physical port and cable connector design as USB-C so you can connect either a USB or Thunderbolt device to a Thunderbolt port. Still, Thunderbolt's overall speed advantage has dropped as USB has gotten dramatically faster in recent years, too, and Thunderbolt is no shoo-in with PC makers. "I've been watching this for six years," said Insight 64 analyst Nathan Brookwood. "Every time they roll out a new version they say, 'This is it!' But it never has achieved mainstream status. It's unlikely it will this time as well." Why use Thunderbolt? On a few laptops like Dell's XPS 13 and HP's Spectre, you'll see a lightning-bolt logo next to a connector port. That means you can plug in fast storage systems, multiple high-resolution monitors, fast network adapters and multipurpose docking stations. You can even plug in high-end desktop PC video cards for playing the latest video games, either on external monitors or with better performance on a laptop's own screen. It's all possible due to Thunderbolt's data-transfer speed. At 40 gigabits per second, it's four times faster than the latest and greatest version of USB and enough to copy an entire 100GB 4K movie in 3.2 seconds -- at least in principle. The fastest Thunderbolt 3 drive out there now, the Akitio Thunder3 PCIe SSD, would take 40 seconds to actually read that much data. Tul's Thunderbolt 3 docking station gives a PC four USB 3.0 ports, a 3.5mm audio jack, an RJ-45 Ethernet adapter, a USB 3.1 Type-C connector, DisplayPort and HDMI video connectors -- and a second Thunderbolt connection to link to other devices. Photo by Stephen Shankland/CNET Thunderbolt devices can be hooked one to another in a "daisy chain," too, so a single port can connect several devices. A Thunderbolt port on a PC can power external devices, up to 15 watts, good enough to run a hard drive, video adapters and network adapters. It will accept up to 100 watts of power so you can charge your laptop, too. Price counts Ziller remains bullish, predicting that ultimately Thunderbolt will ship in more than half of all PCs. Note, however, that in 2012, Ziller hoped "most PCs" would have Thunderbolt by 2015 to 2017. A tiny Intel NUC PC can play high-end games by connecting a hulking desktop graphics card in a Tul Devil Box via a Thunderbolt 3 port. Photo by Stephen Shankland/CNET Many partners are counting on Thunderbolt. More than 100 new devices will arrive in the next six to 12 months using the new Thunderbolt 3 version of the connector, Ziller said. Intel's current Thunderbolt chip, this year's "Alpine Ridge," costs $8.55 for a device maker wanting dual Thunderbolt ports. That may not sound expensive, but it's a full twentieth of the cost a $182 midrange Core i5 processor and fourteenth that of a lower-end $117 Core i3. And PC makers are sensitive to every penny when laptops retail for less than $300. Intel is gradually lowering the costs of these Thunderbolt controller chips, Ziller said, but not as fast as some would like. Cheaper Thunderbolt would spread much faster, said a representative of one device maker at IDF who's eager to sell Thunderbolt products. Intel plans a move that should lower Thunderbolt costs by integrating Thunderbolt into supporting chipsets that computer makers already have to buy alongside a computer's main processor. Chipset integration would mean computer makers essentially get Thunderbolt at no extra cost. "That's in the road map," said Mat Vaughan, a technical marketing engineer, though he declined to say when the integration would happen. Delivering USB-C's promise? The 40Gbps speed is great for gamers with multiple monitors and video editors handling huge files. Now Intel has a Thunderbolt sales pitch for more mainstream computer users, too: It will allay any concerns about what your next PC's USB-C port will be able to do. The back of the HP Spectre has two Thunderbolt ports, right, and a USB port, left. USB devices can be plugged into any of the ports.Photo by Sarah Tew/CNET USB-C can in principle handle high-speed data transfer, video and charging at much higher power levels than earlier USB ports. But there's no guarantee each USB port actually will have all those abilities. For example, Google's Nexus 6P phone still transfers data at the slow rate of a 15-year-old version of the USB standard. Samsung's new Galaxy Note 7 phone transfers data faster but can't send video to TV. The Thunderbolt logo on a port guarantees all these advanced capabilities are there for both USB and Thunderbolt devices, though. "We affectionately call it 'The USB-C that does it all,'" Ziller said. "From the end-user's perspective, when they see that Thunderbolt port on a computer, it's the worry-free port. Anything you plug in, it's going support."

Rather than the wireless network itself, Intel’s focus is on the back-end infrastructure to support this, which it sees as a great opportunity for its processors and other datacentre technology.

At its annual Intel Developer Forum (IDF) event in San Francisco, the firm discussed its vision for a 5G world, where mobile networks will be much more than just a technology for making phone calls and will instead serve a bewildering array of devices – such as sensors connected up via the internet of things (IoT), autonomous vehicles, and other network-enabled infrastructure. “If you look at 5G, we view it as the age of the machines, and everything that enables a fully mobile, connected, intelligent society,” said Asha Keddy, vice-president in Intel's mobile and communications group and general manager of the company's standards and advanced technology team. For this reason, 5G is proving a harder nut to crack than earlier mobile standards, because it will have to serve a wide array of use cases, from connecting billions of small low-power sensors to low-latency streaming of high definition video, to users with tablets or smartphones – and almost certainly some applications that have not been thought of yet. “We don’t know what the future will look like. If you look back to 2G networks, it was all about phones and voice, and then we started having the data revolution. By the time we were rolling out LTE [4G networks], we started requiring things that hadn’t been planned for when LTE was originally designed,” added Keddy. Initially, 5G networks are likely to be made up of multiple wireless technologies, including new air interfaces operating at millimetre wavelengths with data rates measured in gigabits per second, and with the aim of keeping latency down to below 1ms for an end-to-end round trip delay. However, while the exact standards are still a work in progress, AT&T senior vice-president for wireless network architecture Tom Keathley said that he expected to see some early pre-standard deployments as soon as next year, with full roll-outs slated for some time following 2020. Unlike earlier generations of mobile network technology, 5G will be built upon infrastructure making extensive use of technologies such as software-defined networking (SDN), network function virtualisation (NFV), and advanced data analytics. These will be required to enable a service model that can slash the cost of carrying the huge volumes of data that are expected to be generated by billions of connected devices and more widespread use of high-definition video, according to Intel. “One of the things that is important to keep in mind for 5G is that the backhaul network, from the base station back into the core, is already in a transformation, and this is because, as those devices have more and more data passing through them, the network itself has to transform,” said Lynn Comp, director of market development at Intel’s network products group. Not surprisingly, Intel sees this an opportunity, as it has been putting much development effort over the past few years behind SDN and NFV initiatives, as well as working to optimise its processors for handling analytics workloads. But it is not just in the cloud or datacentre, Intel’s traditional area of expertise. The firm is now talking about the need to have intelligence distributed throughout the network, and especially at the network edge, to support some expected use cases for 5G networks. “What you’re seeing is cloud-like capabilities going from the datacentre, into the network and out to the edge, helping to process and add intelligence and insights about what data should go where,” said Comp. The need for this will be driven by applications where a rapid response is called for, according to Intel. For example, when monitoring industrial processes or controlling autonomous vehicles, sending all the data back to a remote datacentre for analysis may simply cause too much of a delay. Having some local analytics capability would be a better solution. If Intel is right, then processing power is not going to be concentrated inside mega datacentres operated by the major cloud providers, but will be spread across the network with base stations and other nodes becoming miniature datacentres in their own right, perhaps caching content locally to cut latency. And naturally, this will also see more Intel chips being sold. CW+ Features Enjoy the benefits of CW+ membership, learn more and join.

And here's why consumers might care this time. Speedy Thunderbolt ports will take off with next-gen PCs, Intel says 0 Computers by Stephen Shankland August 19, 2016 5:00 AM PDT @stshank Up Next Pokemon Go tracking finally goes live and actually works Enlarge Image "Anything you plug in, it's going support," says Jason Ziller, Intel's Thunderbolt marketing chief. Photo by Stephen Shankland/CNET Intel's long-running but largely unsuccessful effort to transform how you plug devices into your PC will make major progress this year and ultimately conquer much of the industry, the chipmaker predicts. Intel has promoted a connection technology called Thunderbolt for years with few signs of the mainstream success enjoyed by its chief rival, USB. At this week's Intel Developer Forum, though, the company offered two reasons why its high-speed connection technology will soon take off as a better way to hook storage systems, external displays and other peripherals to PCs. First is the arrival this fall of PCs powered by Intel's "Kaby Lake" seventh-generation Core processor. Those machines will include the new USB Type-C multipurpose port. Thunderbolt piggybacks on the same physical design, so it will be easier for PC makers to support Thunderbolt. "We're expecting more than double number of designs," up from 60 Thunderbolt-equipped PCs for sale today, said Jason Ziller, the Intel marketing director who's been the public face of Thunderbolt. "The marriage of USB-C and Thunderbolt is really driving a lot of that adoption." Second is Intel's belief that Thunderbolt will soothe compatibility headaches it expects will crop up with USB-C. Today's USB is pretty predictable, but not all new PCs and devices will support new USB abilities like high-power charging and video. If Intel is right, many more people could benefit as Thunderbolt boosts the usefulness and power of ordinary PCs, for example transforming a mainstream laptop into a powerful gaming system. Enlarge Image A single Thunderbolt cable lets an ordinary laptop use a poweful external graphics card and three external monitors at the Intel Developer Forum.Photo by Stephen Shankland/CNET If you're not familiar with Thunderbolt, think of it as a beefier version of USB, with faster data-transfer speeds and some extra abilities. But it's also a proprietary technology available only from Intel, not an industry standard like USB that's more likely to spread broadly and to cost less. The new Thunderbolt 3 version doubled its top speed in 2015, and this year Thunderbolt begins using the same physical port and cable connector design as USB-C so you can connect either a USB or Thunderbolt device to a Thunderbolt port. Still, Thunderbolt's overall speed advantage has dropped as USB has gotten dramatically faster in recent years, too, and Thunderbolt is no shoo-in with PC makers. "I've been watching this for six years," said Insight 64 analyst Nathan Brookwood. "Every time they roll out a new version they say, 'This is it!' But it never has achieved mainstream status. It's unlikely it will this time as well." Why use Thunderbolt? On a few laptops like Dell's XPS 13 and HP's Spectre, you'll see a lightning-bolt logo next to a connector port. That means you can plug in fast storage systems, multiple high-resolution monitors, fast network adapters and multipurpose docking stations. You can even plug in high-end desktop PC video cards for playing the latest video games, either on external monitors or with better performance on a laptop's own screen. It's all possible due to Thunderbolt's data-transfer speed. At 40 gigabits per second, it's four times faster than the latest and greatest version of USB and enough to copy an entire 100GB 4K movie in 3.2 seconds -- at least in principle. The fastest Thunderbolt 3 drive out there now, the Akitio Thunder3 PCIe SSD, would take 40 seconds to actually read that much data. Tul's Thunderbolt 3 docking station gives a PC four USB 3.0 ports, a 3.5mm audio jack, an RJ-45 Ethernet adapter, a USB 3.1 Type-C connector, DisplayPort and HDMI video connectors -- and a second Thunderbolt connection to link to other devices. Photo by Stephen Shankland/CNET Thunderbolt devices can be hooked one to another in a "daisy chain," too, so a single port can connect several devices. A Thunderbolt port on a PC can power external devices, up to 15 watts, good enough to run a hard drive, video adapters and network adapters. It will accept up to 100 watts of power so you can charge your laptop, too. Price counts Ziller remains bullish, predicting that ultimately Thunderbolt will ship in more than half of all PCs. Note, however, that in 2012, Ziller hoped "most PCs" would have Thunderbolt by 2015 to 2017. A tiny Intel NUC PC can play high-end games by connecting a hulking desktop graphics card in a Tul Devil Box via a Thunderbolt 3 port. Photo by Stephen Shankland/CNET Many partners are counting on Thunderbolt. More than 100 new devices will arrive in the next six to 12 months using the new Thunderbolt 3 version of the connector, Ziller said. Intel's current Thunderbolt chip, this year's "Alpine Ridge," costs $8.55 for a device maker wanting dual Thunderbolt ports. That may not sound expensive, but it's a full twentieth of the cost a $182 midrange Core i5 processor and fourteenth that of a lower-end $117 Core i3. And PC makers are sensitive to every penny when laptops retail for less than $300. Intel is gradually lowering the costs of these Thunderbolt controller chips, Ziller said, but not as fast as some would like. Cheaper Thunderbolt would spread much faster, said a representative of one device maker at IDF who's eager to sell Thunderbolt products. Intel plans a move that should lower Thunderbolt costs by integrating Thunderbolt into supporting chipsets that computer makers already have to buy alongside a computer's main processor. Chipset integration would mean computer makers essentially get Thunderbolt at no extra cost. "That's in the road map," said Mat Vaughan, a technical marketing engineer, though he declined to say when the integration would happen. Delivering USB-C's promise? The 40Gbps speed is great for gamers with multiple monitors and video editors handling huge files. Now Intel has a Thunderbolt sales pitch for more mainstream computer users, too: It will allay any concerns about what your next PC's USB-C port will be able to do. The back of the HP Spectre has two Thunderbolt ports, right, and a USB port, left. USB devices can be plugged into any of the ports.Photo by Sarah Tew/CNET USB-C can in principle handle high-speed data transfer, video and charging at much higher power levels than earlier USB ports. But there's no guarantee each USB port actually will have all those abilities. For example, Google's Nexus 6P phone still transfers data at the slow rate of a 15-year-old version of the USB standard. Samsung's new Galaxy Note 7 phone transfers data faster but can't send video to TV. The Thunderbolt logo on a port guarantees all these advanced capabilities are there for both USB and Thunderbolt devices, though. "We affectionately call it 'The USB-C that does it all,'" Ziller said. "From the end-user's perspective, when they see that Thunderbolt port on a computer, it's the worry-free port. Anything you plug in, it's going support."

The event took place at St. Regis Hotel in San Francisco. CEO AMD Lisa Su unveiled the names of both the CPUs— Summit Ridge and Naples. However, the Gaming PCs and Thin Laptops would feature the former while Data center Servers will exhibit the latter. Their chips will be manufactured under a 14nm Fin Field Effect Transistor (FinFET) process. AMD specified that Summit Ridge CPU will feature 8-core simultaneous multi-threading technology (SMT) to give it a 16-thread processing power. Naples will feature 32-core and 64-threads with SMT, which is similar to Intel Corporation’s (NASDAQ:INTC) Hyperthreading. Interestingly, this is the first time AMD aims to cater the high-end gaming PC market as compared to its prior budget-friendly chips. The CEO also claimed that the high-end performance of Zen processors could be a challenge for Intel’s Broadwell-E processor, which is the fastest to date. This would help AMD to compete with Intel and swipe a large chunk of the market share. The Zen chips are expected to be available in 2017— Summit Ridge will release in the first quarter whereas Naples is likely to launch in the subsequent quarter. This can be a leading factor as to why AMD stock price has escalated 82% in second-quarter fiscal 2016 (2QFY16) over blockbuster earnings in 1HFY16. The company’s foray into high-end gaming places is right in the ring with NVidia Corp. and Intel. The semiconductor company is expected to post a loss of 1 cent per share on revenue of $1.21 billion. Such results would reflect a healthy year-over-year (YoY) increment in Advanced Micro Device’s fortunes.

Intel's current Thunderbolt chip, this year's "Alpine Ridge," costs $8.55 for a device maker wanting dual Thunderbolt ports. That may not sound expensive, but it's a full twentieth of the cost a $182 midrange Core i5 processor and fourteenth that of a lower-end $117 Core i3. And PC makers are sensitive to every penny when laptops retail for less than $300. Intel is gradually lowering the costs of these Thunderbolt controller chips, Ziller said, but not as fast as some would like. Cheaper Thunderbolt would spread much faster, said a representative of one device maker at IDF who's eager to sell Thunderbolt products. Intel plans a move that should lower Thunderbolt costs by integrating Thunderbolt into supporting chipsets that computer makers already have to buy alongside a computer's main processor. Chipset integration would mean computer makers essentially get Thunderbolt at no extra cost. "That's in the road map," said Mat Vaughan, a technical marketing engineer, though he declined to say when the integration would happen. Delivering USB-C's promise? The 40Gbps speed is great for gamers with multiple monitors and video editors handling huge files. Now Intel has a Thunderbolt sales pitch for more mainstream computer users, too: It will allay any concerns about what your next PC's USB-C port will be able to do. The back of the HP Spectre has two Thunderbolt ports, right, and a USB port, left. USB devices can be plugged into any of the ports.Photo by Sarah Tew/CNET USB-C can in principle handle high-speed data transfer, video and charging at much higher power levels than earlier USB ports. But there's no guarantee each USB port actually will have all those abilities. For example, Google's Nexus 6P phone still transfers data at the slow rate of a 15-year-old version of the USB standard. Samsung's new Galaxy Note 7 phone transfers data faster but can't send video to TV. The Thunderbolt logo on a port guarantees all these advanced capabilities are there for both USB and Thunderbolt devices, though. "We affectionately call it 'The USB-C that does it all,'" Ziller said. "From the end-user's perspective, when they see that Thunderbolt port on a computer, it's the worry-free port. Anything you plug in, it's going support."

While the leaks haven’t been confirmed as genuine, it was interesting to see the conversation around Zen and AMD’s expected performance level. Then, at an event on Wednesday, AMD showed some demos of Zen running clock-for-clock against Intel’s 6900K. While these demos were not performed at full speed, they offered some evidence that AMD could match Intel clock-for-clock in certain workloads — and while such demos are always cherry-picked to favor one’s own company, they gave some additional context on what Zen can do. What I want to talk about here has less to do with AMD’s demo or specifics of the architecture and more to do with what AMD needs to deliver to be considered a success. One thing I’ll say up front: I have no secret sources, no hidden informants, and no leaks to credit for what I’m about to write. Agree or disagree, these are my own thoughts and observations. AMD claims that Zen will have 40% better IPC than its previous Excavator architecture and it’s shown demos illustrating how Zen can compete clock-for-clock against the 6900K in some workloads. This is both a solid indication of where the chip currently is and a generalized prediction of where it could end up. The details and specifics will depend on a number of factors including final clock speeds and application-level optimization. What does 40% more IPC mean, anyway? IPC stands for instructions per clock or instructions per cycle (the two terms are synonymous). It’s a metric of CPU efficiency — the higher a CPU’s IPC, the more work that CPU can perform in a given amount of time. There’s typically an inverse relationship between a CPU’s clock speed and its IPC. While IPC has always been used to measure CPU performance, the term became common in enthusiast circles when Intel debuted the original Pentium 4. While the P4 was clocked much higher than its Pentium 3 predecessor, the amount of work it performed per clock cycle was significantly lower. The net result of this was that the Pentium 4 1.5GHz often struggled to outperform the slower Pentium 3 1GHz or its Athlon K7 counterpart from AMD. The most common way to parse AMD’s statement is as follows: If you took an Excavator CPU and a Zen CPU and ran them at the same clock speed, the Zen CPU should be 40% faster, on average, then the AMD CPU it replaces. But even here, there have been questions: Does that 40% IPC improvement include the impact of simultaneous multi-threading (what Intel calls Hyper-Threading) or not? Is that based on two chips clocked at the same frequency or not? Finally and most importantly, which tests were used to derive that figure? IPC isn’t a constant — it fluctuates a great deal based on the behavior of the target application. The benchmark above is from tests I ran when Bulldozer launched nearly five years ago. Despite losing to AMD’s older six-core X6 1100T in multiple benchmarks, the FX-8150 was actually significantly faster in Maxwell Render — one of the few tests it unilaterally won. This kind of variance is normal, which is why it’s so difficult to draw conclusions about relative chip performance based on any single metric. AMD’s claimed 40% IPC uplift should be treated like a general or average prediction and not the guaranteed result of any single test. How will Zen compare with Intel CPUs? The real question, of course, isn’t whether Zen will improve on Carrizo, but whether it’ll give AMD a CPU that can compete with Intel. The realistic answer is “It’ll depend on where you look and what you’re looking for.” Here’s what I mean by that. Compare AMD’s current top-end Piledriver, the FX-9590, against Intel’s Core i7-6700K using Anandtech’s Bench tool. I’ve snipped a section of tests to include below, but you can view the full comparison here. In the graph below, blue is for the FX-9590, while the orange-ish bar is Intel’s Core i7-6700K. Data by Anandtech Assume for a moment that these FX-9590 results actually reflected Excavator performance instead of Piledriver. Now, assume they were 40% faster than they actually are. Would this theoretical top-end chip offer competitive performance with Intel? In some tests, it absolutely would. In other tests, the gap between AMD and Intel is large enough that even a 40% improvement isn’t enough to allow AMD to catch its competitor. Those of you who want to perform this comparison using actual data from Excavator can refer to this AT review of the chip and do the math from there. Either way, the point holds — there are tests where a 40% improvement would absolutely be enough to allow AMD to catch Intel and tests where it wouldn’t be. When we say “It’s going to depend,” it’s not a dodge or an excuse, it’s a fact. AMD’s IDF showcase gave some additional information but not enough to change this basic situation. How do you eat an elephant? One of the common arguments raised in the Ashes of the Singularity benchmark thread was that Zen’s comparatively weak performance compared with the Core i7-6900K is proof that AMD’s eight-core chip won’t be able to compete against Intel. The simple fact that these test results were run on an ES chip of unknown stepping and vintage make that an extremely premature conclusion. Worse, it’s a conclusion founded in an incorrect premise — specifically, that AMD has to match Intel’s top-end performance in order to compete at all. While AMD’s recent demos should assuage some of these fears, the early unveil wasn’t meant to be a complete overview of every aspect of the chip’s performance. Right now, AMD’s FX-8350 is a $160 CPU, while the top-end FX-9590 retails for $229. Intel’s quad-core Core i5 desktop processors start at $185 for older Haswell parts and $190 for Skylake. The cheapest Core i7 you can buy starts at $295 for Haswell and $305 for Skylake (all prices from NewEgg). This means the FX-8350 is priced against a high-end Skylake Core i3 (the Core i3-6320) while the FX-9590 faces off against the Core i5-6600 — a comparatively tiny chip with an integrated GPU and one-third the TDP.   In the 15 years I’ve been reviewing CPUs, the gap between AMD and Intel has never been larger than it is today. That’s part of why Zen is so important, but it’s also why it’s important to keep perspective on what kind of performance improvement AMD can reasonably deliver in a single product cycle. Based on AMD’s single 40% IPC figure, it’s extremely unlikely that the company will deliver a CPU that can match Intel’s performance at every particular and at every price point — and it doesn’t need to. A 40% IPC boost would allow AMD to challenge Intel’s Core i3/i5/i7 line-up by leveraging larger core counts and its own SMT implementation far more effectively than Piledriver ever did. The drastically reduced TDP (Zen has reportedly targeted 95W at the high end) will allow it to compete much more aggressively on power consumption. Higher CPU efficiency means that AMD won’t need to rely on high clocks to hit performance targets, making it easier to push into laptops when Zen-based APUs come to market. Trade-offs between core count and clock speed also mean AMD can probably offer lower core counts at higher clocks, the same way that Intel does. It’s easy to forget, but AMD didn’t launch K7 in 1999 and seize 20% of the server market 12 months later. K7 was competitive with the Pentium 3, but not necessarily faster — particularly since Intel’s Coppermine P3’s ran a full-speed L2 cache while the slot-based K7 and K7.5 used a half-speed or 1/3 speed L2. Socket A and Thunderbird closed this gap in June 2000, but AMD didn’t enter the server market until 2001. It didn’t see serious success in the server market until 2003, when K8 gave it the legs it needed to go head-to-head with Intel’s high-end Xeons. Right now, Intel’s least expensive eight-core processor is the Core i7-5960X, at $1,015. AMD doesn’t need to hit Intel in the $1,000 CPU market to drastically improve its own fortunes or competitive standing. Conclusion Zen will be judged a failure or a success based on how well it performs today and on how well it positions AMD to deliver future improvements. It may not going to be strong enough to go toe-to-toe with Skylake across every SKU and price point, but that’s not what it needs to do. AMD needs Zen to perform well at low power so it can be paired with an APU and slipped into notebooks. It needs Zen to be more efficient than Excavator so Sunnyvale isn’t left pricing eight-core chips against Intel’s Core i3. And it needs Zen to be strong enough that investors and enthusiasts see the core as a future to be built upon, rather than an anchor around the company’s neck. I genuinely don’t know how well AMD will deliver on these goals. But those are the criteria I expect the chip to need to fulfill and the metrics by which I’ll judge its overall position. I’ll have more to say about Zen, including a deep dive into its architecture, when I return next week.

Intel Turbo Boost Max 3.0 Support For Linux Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 19 August 2016 at 08:02 AM EDT. 9 Comments Earlier this year I heard from an Intel PR representative they had no plans for a Turbo Boost Max 3.0 Linux driver and immediately heard after that from a developer it was bollocks from the media department as usual. Today patches have emerged for supporting Turbo Boost Max 3.0 in the Linux kernel. Turbo Boost Max 3.0 is a feature to the Intel Broadwell-E CPUs and presumably more forthcoming high-end CPUs. Turbo Boost Max 3.0 is about boosting the frequency of a single CPU core when a single-threaded application is busy on the system occupied. TBM Tech 3.0 is in contrast to Turbo Boost 2.0 that boosts the frequency of all CPU cores when needed for short periods of time. But over the older Turbo Boost tech, TBM 3.0 can maintain its single-boosted-core frequency for a longer duration. Patches published by Srinivas Pandruvada on Tuesday provide support for Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 along with CPUFreq and scheduler changes. TBM 3.0 is disabled by default but can be enabled via sysfs: echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/sched_itmt_enabled. The patches for now can be found on the kernel mailing list and will hopefully be ready for merging into the Linux 4.9 kernel. 9 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Tags on a fragile packages may someday be able to say whether the goods are riding safely in the back of a truck or bouncing around in a hazardous way. If Intel follows through on an IoT research project it demonstrated at Intel Developer Forum this week, those tags could report on shipping conditions in real time without needing a battery to stay powered. After the package is delivered, the label might even be disposable. Stephen Lawson Intel demonstrated a prototype "smart tag" for packages at Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco on Aug. 16, 2016. The tag could detect motion and show it on a chart in real time. It’s the kind of IoT that enterprises might not even be aware of as a device or system but could still benefit from every day. Meanwhile, for a shipping company, it might save on labor and specialized technology rollouts. In Intel's demonstration, a real-time graph generated by sensor readings automatically showed a box getting shaken up. Power came from a standard, unlicensed wireless network. The key to this oversharing tag is what Intel calls a mote. It’s a chip so small it could get lost in a jar of coarse-ground pepper. The IA-32 mote shown at IDF, built on Intel's Quark architecture, would be the brains of a tag that could incorporate motion, temperature and other sensors. The tiny size of the processor is a big part of what makes the whole system viable, as it keeps both energy draw and per-chip costs low. The mote doesn’t talk directly to the cloud. Instead, it uses a short-range, low-power network – in this case, Bluetooth Low Energy – to a local gateway device that forwards the data over a longer-range network like cellular. The local gateway might also process or store the data first. The mote is so small and efficient, using only about 1 milliwatt, that it can run on energy harvested from radio waves wafting through the air around it. For example, a Wi-Fi network on a truck might bathe a trailer full of packages with enough RF (radio frequency) energy to power motes on every one of them, Intel researcher Turbo Majumder said. There are other possible power sources for a tiny chip like this. In the mote booth at IDF, Intel displayed a fingertip-sized solar panel that could be paired with it. Harvesting power from motion could also work. But both of those sources would require batteries to keep the mote running and communicating while stationary or in the dark. RF energy harvesting works whenever the radio waves it uses are strong enough. Cell towers dotting the landscape mean RF is almost everywhere, but those kinds of radio waves from a distance usually aren’t powerful enough to power a device like the mote, Majumder said. It’s likely to need a local source, like a truck’s on-board LTE radio or office Wi-Fi.

But if you want to make PCs, that future looks far from rosy. VIEW ALL PHOTOS IN GALLERY SAN FRANCISCO—While we were waiting to get into the AMD Zen press pre-briefing last night, I heard several colleagues (who shall remain nameless) at other publications state aloud a sentiment I had felt but had been uncomfortable expressing: This year's Intel Developer Forum (IDF) was a bit dull. Not that it hasn't generated a fair amount of buzz, mind you. In fact, it felt as if IDF nabbed more attention from those outside this world than it has for a while, primarily thanks to the Project Alloy cordless VR headset that looks as if it will fix one of the biggest flaws with this fascinating emerging technology. And certainly, there was word about a few other major advancements, such as 5G and silicon photonics, that could have a big impact on the world. If you love processors, chipsets, and other hardware of that nature, however, there wasn't a ton for you at IDF. The biggest public acknowledgment of the realm that has traditionally been Intel's bread and butter came in Brian Krzanich's Tuesday keynote address, but it was at best a glancing mention of the future potential of the company's 7th Generation Core (aka "Kaby Lake") processors. If you wanted to dig deep into them, to discover as much as possible about the way they worked, what new graphics and technologies they'd utilize, and so on, you couldn't go to a Technical Session or a panel discussion. I missed that. And, given what I heard from a lot of my friends at the show, I wasn't the only one. This is a feeling I've struggled with for a while, and it seems unlikely to abate anytime soon. When I first became interested in computers in the 1980s, it was because I loved how raw it all was. How, with just a few keystrokes, anyone could write an Integer BASIC program to do, er, basic things, or how, with a bit more effort, you could dig into a game's code and uncover the secrets that, for whatever reason, you could never manage on your own. (After 30-plus years, I think it's safe—if still a little embarrassing—to admit that this is the only way I was able to "win" the original Snooper Troops.) Or how you could pop a new card or a few memory SIMMs into your computer, noodle away at the CONFIG.SYS file for a few minutes (or, uh, hours) and come out with a computer a lot more capable than the one you started with. VIEW ALL PHOTOS IN GALLERY As time passed and I began building my own computers from scratch, I developed a healthy and even stronger respect and curiosity for what underneath made it all possible. This led to my "enthusiast" years, which comprised, among other things, consulting, working in IT, and eventually landing at PCMag.com. It's been an amazing, unusual ride, and one that I've found just as enjoyable as it's been educational. And coming through all that to where we are today, where technology is even more integrated into our lives than I ever could have imagined as a kid—and will only become more so in the years ahead—is undeniably exciting. Like my friends at the show, though, I can't sit through a speech at a show like Intel and not feel a tinge of sadness that this thing I grew up with is either going away or changing so much that it will be beyond most people's grasp. It's already moved into a pretty deep niche, and when major companies place it even further in the background, it's tough not to worry about what sort of life it still has before it. For how many more years will I even be able to build my own computer? For that matter, for how many more years will computers themselves even be things? //Related Articles Intel Lays Out its Vision for a Fully Connected World What can I say: It's hard to give up on your first love. My pulse still skips a beat when I use a powerful new processor for the first time, or plug in an amazing new video card and watch it blow away the last generation's king. That's where my affections lie, because companies like Intel, through their constant innovation and exploration of the possibilities of silicon and dreaming, showed me the wonder inherent in it all and made me want to be a part of it. And there's not a day that I don't wake up at least a little thrilled that I get to be. But just walking around the Moscone Center during IDF dims the lights a little bit. There were plenty of signs and banners emblazoned with words and imagery advertising all sorts of forward-thinking ideas, but very few of which had to do with processor technology (or even hardware at all). Various demo kiosks let you play with drones, robots, and other smart devices, but the brains behind it all always seemed of secondary (or maybe tertiary) importance. The event's slogan even suggested that Intel was looking in a whole new direction: "The Future Is What You MAKE" (capital letters intended). Maybe a future rooted in the Internet of Things won't be so bad; maybe when chips really are everywhere, and in everything, they'll reacquire some of the magical patina they've lost in our public consciousness. I hope so. But if the future is, indeed, what you make, a big part of me still wants to make, and use, computers. Is there a place for me in that bright, fully interconnected future? Only time has the definitive answer, but the one being constantly whispered in my ear from IDF 2016 was not exactly reassuring.

Intel’s roadmap has been laid out at Intel Developer Forum (IDF) this week, though there are still a few hairpin turns to negotiate before the finish line is in sight. Intel believes there will be a 120 million vehicles with varying degrees of autonomous featured on the roads by 2030, though there was little mention of the 2021 target which was mentioned a couple of weeks ago during the partnership announcement with BMW and Mobileye. After the talks at IDF it could suggest the 2021 figure was being used as more of a PR soundbite, geared around the development of standards as opposed to a mass market product. Intel spent significant sums of money on trying to get into the mobile game eventually coming to the conclusion it was not able to compete with the likes of ARM. It would appear the company has matured somewhat following the experience. Instead of investing heavily on the device side of the IoT market, it is prioritizing its expertise; IoT in the data centre. The talks at IDF highlighted the full portfolio Intel has at its disposal, with the team claiming an ‘end-to-end’ technology assets to power the vehicle, communications and the data centre. The key message here is Intel will be able to sufficiently support the demands of storing, sharing and protecting the unprecedented rates of data that will feed deep learning algorithms to train the vehicle. In other news, Uber is also moving up through the gears after announcing it will acquire self-driving start-up Otto. The company, which specializes in self-driving trucks for long-haulage, is currently headed up by Anthony Levandowski who is considered by some to be a pioneer in the autonomous vehicles world. One of his first inventions, a self-driving motorcycle called Ghostrider, is now in the Smithsonian. Levandowski will now be one of Uber’s top engineers. “Together, we now have one of the strongest autonomous engineering groups in the world; self-driving trucks and cars that are already on the road thanks to Otto and Uber’s Advanced Technologies Center in Pittsburgh; the practical experience that comes from running ridesharing and delivery services in hundreds of cities; with the data and intelligence that comes from doing 1.2 billion miles on the road every month,” said Travis Kalanick, CEO at Uber. The acquisition also drives Uber into a new market segment; long-distance delivery services. For some, the delivery service industry would be a logical step for Uber, which has rapidly risen to fame over the last few years. While the company has been hitting some speedbumps in recent weeks, it has been forced onto the hard shoulder in China, the success of the brand has not been brought into question. That said, the team still have lofty ambitions, moving into new markets and even decreasing its dependence on third-parties by investing in its own mapping technologies. Alongside the Otto announcement, the team will also partner Volvo Cars to lead a joint project to develop new base vehicles that will be able to incorporate the latest developments in autonomous driving technologies, up to and including fully autonomous driverless cars. As part of the partnership, Uber will allow customers in downtown Pittsburgh to summon self-driving cars from their phones, according to Bloomberg. The Uber/Volvo fleet will be at first be supervised by humans in the passenger seat, though this is the first instance of self-driving cars entering into the customers world. Should the initiative run to plan, Uber could be seen on pole position in the self-driving race, though Google and Tesla might have something to say about this in the coming months. The key difference between the three brands who could be seen to be leaders in the field, Uber has not vocalized any intentions to manufacture its own vehicles offering more freedom to collaborate with other manufactures around the world. Both companies will use the same base vehicle in their own individual efforts, while also collaborating on breakthroughs. The new base vehicle will be developed on Volvo modular Scalable Product Architecture (SPA), to further add to the scalability of the SPA platform to include all needed safety, redundancy and new features required to have autonomous vehicles on the road.

The special event for the press and analysts, held Wednesday night during the Intel Developer Forum convention in San Francisco, was hosted by AMD CEO Lisa Su. She first indicated to the audience that AMD undertook an important-yet-massive performance-per-watt “journey” when it embarked on its quest for Zen. The company has made significant progress since then, and is now providing some rather significant disclosures on its current Zen and Summit Ridge development. As previously reported, Summit Ridge will be based on 14nm FinFET process technology offered by GlobalFoundries, the same process used on AMD’s Polaris-based graphics chips. It will feature eight Zen cores and 16 threads and support AMD’s “Bristol Ridge” AM4 platform, which is also compatible with the company’s seventh-generation A-Series desktop processors. AM4 supports goodies like DDR4 system memory, the company’s APUs, PCI Express Gen3, USB 3.1 Gen2, NVMe, SATA Express storage, and loads more. OEM PC designs will sport the AM4 platform in solutions with A-Series processors sometime in this half of 2016. Meanwhile, the technical Zen details provided by AMD in Wednesday’s presentation can be seen in our formatted gallery below for your viewing pleasure. The first Zen-based product will appear in the high-end desktop enthusiast market. After that, Zen-based chips will roll out to the enterprise-class server market followed by mobile PCs and the embedded application market. Highlights include two threads per core for simultaneous multithreading (aka Hyper-Threading over at Team Intel), 8MB of shared L3 cache, 512K of L2 cache per core, and two AES units for safer computing. One of the slides presented by Senior VP and CTO Mark Papermaster showed that each Zen core will have a “significantly” enhanced pre-fetch feature, separate low latency L1 instruction and L1 data caches, and up to five times more cache bandwidth for each Zen core.  Other notable technical advancements include an enhanced branch prediction for selecting the right instructions, a 1.75x instruction scheduler, and more. All of this means dramatic gains in single-threaded performance. “We assembled a team to create a grounds-up, from scratch, new CPU design for x86,” Papermaster told the audience. “It’s a brand new micro-architecture. A CPU that can scale from that high performance all the way down to PC and mobile applications. How do we get a 40 percent instruction per clock improvement from the previous generation? It starts with performance, throughput, and efficiency.” AMD CPU Core RoadmapMore As seen in the slide above, AMD lays out the evolution of its processor core technology since the introduction of its “Bulldozer” architecture. Plowing through “Piledriver,” “Steamtoller,” “Excavator,” and the current Zen, AMD has steadily increased the number of instructions-per-clock for each core while simultaneously dropping the amount of energy per cycle. It’s AMD’s way of showing the increased performance-per-watt the company has managed since the release of the older Bulldozer processor core.

Using the multi-threaded Blender rendering benchmark, the company showed in real-time the Summit Ridge sample rendering the Zen logo slightly faster than Intel’s highly coveted CPU just launched back in June. AMD Naples Server SoCMore AMD also revealed its “Naples” SoC for enterprise-class servers that features a massive 32 Zen cores and 64 threads. Suresh Gopalakrishnan, CVP of Enterprise Engineering, showed two Naples chips crammed onto a two-socket motherboard that will be used in upcoming servers (seriously, why can’t we do that on desktop), as shown above. “What AMD showed on Zen last night was very compelling on performance,” analyst Patrick Moorhead told Digital Trends via email. “There’s a lot of execution between now and launch, but at a minimum, I believe AMD will be in a much better position than they have been in years in processors. To put this in perspective, this is the biggest thing I’ve seen in 10 years in CPUs at AMD.” According to AMD, the next twelve months will see GPU market share gains thanks to the current Polaris GPU architecture, and its upcoming “Vega” architecture slated for 2017 (if not sooner). The company also expects to return to growth in the PC market thanks to its Zen core technology, and to ramp up its new semi-custom business. AMD is also re-entering the “highly-profitable” x86-based server market thanks to its Naples SoC.

AMD CEO Lisa Su and CTO Mark Papermaster shared a few concrete details about the Zen architecture, although no specific CPU models were unveiled. It was also announced that products would not ship before the end of this year as earlier expected. Zen is a completely new architecture, which the company has been working on in the hopes of reclaiming market share lost by its current lineup of FX-series CPUs and A-series APUs, most of which have been underwhelming. AMD has been unable to match Intel at the high end of the performance scale for several years now and has had to cut prices drastically in order to remain an option at the low end. Also, while AMD has not progressed beyond the 28nm fabrication process, Intel has been able to go down to 14nm and was till recently expected to achieve 10nm fabrication this year. The stakes for AMD therefore cannot be overstated.AMD pointed out its successes in the games console market, including the fact that Microsoft will use an AMD processor in its upcoming Xbox One 'Project Scorpio' refresh, as well as the positive reception its new Radeon RX-series graphics cards have had. CEO Lisa Su described the company's current and upcoming offerings as its "most competitive product lineup in a decade". Overall, AMD is claiming that Zen offers 40 percent more performance per clock cycle than its current products. Zen will introduce a number of new techniques and features, starting with a new pipeline with improved branch prediction and a new micro-op cache resulting in improved efficiency in terms of instructions per clock cycle. A typical Zen CPU will have 8MB of shared L3 cache, while each core will have a 512K L2 cache as well as independent L1 caches for data and instructions. The result should be up to 5X better cache bandwidth to a core. AMD is no longer sharing resources between cores, which enables it to offer simultaneous multi-threading more like Intel's Hyper-Threading technique. Each core can execute two threads, both of which appear equal to the OS and software. Zen CPUs will be fabricated by GlobalFoundries on a 14nm 3D FinFET process which should have a significantly positive impact on heat generation and power consumption, allowing AMD to push into thin and light notebooks which have been powered by Intel for years now. Power efficiency has also factored into the design of the architecture, and different blocks will be able to have their power reduced or turned off when they aren't needed. While exact product SKUs, speeds, TDPs, core counts and of course prices were not shared, we do know what form at least some of them will take. The company is using the code name 'Summit Ridge' for at least one 8-core, 16-thread CPU which will be aimed at high-end enthusiasts and gamers. AMD compared a Summit Ridge engineering sample to Intel's top-of-the-line 8-core Broadwell-E Core i7-6900K Extreme Edition CPU at its event, though that particular sample was down-clocked to match the Summit Ridge at 3GHz. The company is claiming equivalent or better performance between architectures, though only one very specific Blender 3D workload was compared. Desktop Zen CPus like the Summit Ridge will require new motherboards and chipsets, which AMD is delivering in the form of the Socket AM4 platform. This is another area in which AMD has lagged, but AM4 will correct that with support for modern IO including PCIe 3.0, NVMe, DDR4 RAM, and 10Gbps USB 3.1. There will also be a server SoC product, codenamed 'Naples', with 32 cores, which will be capable of running in multi-socket configurations. While the mobile and embedded markets were mentioned, no specific products were named. We'll have to wait for more information, though at least some new details could be released as early as next week when AMD presents its Zen architecture at the annual Hot Chips conference. While a resurgent AMD would be great for consumers and for the industry as a whole, there isn't enough information yet to be able to guess how successful Zen might be. The comparison to Intel's latest and greatest architecture is a positive sign, even with only one demonstration in a very specific test with parameters and conditions chosen by AMD itself.

Boasts of scalabiity? Sunshine Navarro19 August, 2016 (Wikimedia Commons)AMD is about to update its list of processors with Zen, which is rumored to boast an advantage over Intel Core processors. Sponsored Watch Your Favorite Christian Films, 24/7. Click Here To Start Your Free Trial Today The past few months have seen Advanced Micro Device (AMD) keeping vital information regarding its latest AMD Zen processor under wraps. Nevertheless, talks are rife that the highly anticipated processor will be faster than the Intel Core i5 and boasts of scalability. On Wednesday, PC World conducted an interview with AMD's chief technical officer (CTO) Mark Papermaster after the company's demonstration of the Zen processor. According to Papermaster, the Zen has been in development for not more than four years, and as much as possible, they will try to make its prices competitive with Intel products. He said they "don't want any of that fear, uncertainty, and doubt" on the part of consumers once the AMD Zen is officially released. Papermaster likewise shared that the AMD Zen will scale, which means consumers can get it into a laptop with reasonable power. "It's designed for scalability. The key points I made are twofold: microarchitecture and design methodologies. I showed you this whole history of our prior cores; there was no FinFET. What I showed you was a bigger gap in [our] foundry versus Intel's foundry capabilities. That drove us to really hone the techniques in energy efficiency. We applied all of that to the Zen core design. Then we leveraged FinFET. That combination gives us tremendous scale." Little is known about the AMD Zen as far as specs go. The electronics company is keeping mum about the processor's overall clock performance and speed. However, an engineering sample conducted recently is giving tech savvies an idea how fast and competitive the AMD Zen is compared, particularly, to Intel processors. WCCF Tech reported the benchmark results showing the AMD Zen is indeed faster than the Intel Core i5 processor. Proof of this is the Order Part Number (OPN) of the leaked sample, which is 1D2801A2M88E4_32/28_N. Apparently, this unique identifier of the AMD Zen slyly reveals the base and turbo clocks of the processor. The numbers following the long series of numbers, 32/28, show that the Zen processor boasts of a 3.2 GHz turbo clock and a 2.8 GHz base clock. The AMD Zen's capability to battle it out against Intel Core on a clock-for-clock basis is proof of how impressive and remarkable the Zen processor is. Many tech-savvy consumers are hoping it gets released soon so they can experience its performance firsthand.

We love your deep learning benchmark 'mistakes' 19 Aug 2016 at 10:07, Dan Olds, OrionX Dan Olds, OrionX Get email alert when this author posts Common Topics Cluster Competition, Cluster, Hpc, High Performance Computing, Nvidia Recent Articles Boffins of the future gear up to build their own beastmode rigs OpenStack brings cloud at the press of a button This week's biggest shock: The race to 200Gbps has been won HPC blog Nvidia just fired the first salvo in what promises to be a classic and long-lived benchmark death match vs Intel. In a webpage titled "Correcting Intel's Deep Learning Benchmark Mistakes," Nvidia claimed that Intel was using outdated GPU benchmark results and non-current hardware comparisons to show off its new Knights Landing Xeon Phi processors. Nvidia called out three Intel claims in particular: "Xeon Phi is 2.3 times faster in training than GPUs." This claim was made in a press presentation delivered at ISC'16 and on an Intel-produced "fact sheet" (PDFs available here and here). It specifically refers to a stat at the left side of slide 12 (and the second page of the fact sheet) where Intel claims Phi is 2.3 times faster on the AlexNet image training on a DNN (deep neural network). Nvidia alleges that Intel is using 18-month-old AlexNet numbers for Nvidia (based on a Maxwell system), while using farm-fresh numbers for the Intel Phi. According to Nvidia, its Pascal processors in the same four-accelerator configuration outperform Intel's Phi by 1.9 times. It also claims its new NVIDIA 8-GPU DGX-1 dedicated DNN training machine can complete AlexNet in two hours, outshining the 4 Phi system by 5.3 times. Ouch. "Xeon Phi offers 38 per cent better scaling than GPUs across nodes." This claim also occurs in both of the Intel documents referenced above. In this case, Intel is saying that their Phi systems scale better than GPU-equipped boxes, namely when it comes to 32-way/accelerator configurations. According to Nvidia, Intel is using four-year-old numbers from Oak Ridge's Titan machine, which was using the old Jaguar interconnect and old K20 GPUs, as a comparison to Intel's brand-new Omni Path Architecture connected Phi processors running deep learning workloads. It points out Baidu-published specs from its speech training workload that show near linear GPU scaling not just to 32 nodes, but to 128 nodes. Ouch again. "Xeon Phi delivers 50 times scaling on 128 nodes." I didn't see this exact claim in the Intel documents, but there were a lot of claims flying around, so I could have missed it. Whether it's there or not, Nvidia responded to it by again pointing to the near-linear Baidu 128-GPU node result. By the by, getting a 50 times speed up by adding 128 times more resources isn't the kind of scalability you write home about, you know? What's funny to me is that at the end of Nvidia's "correction" webpage, it welcomes Intel to the era of AI, with an additional admonition that "they should get their facts straight." Hmmm. But I'd like to see something more along the lines of the old, and unpublished, Data General ad where they are welcoming IBM to the minicomputer market. The two-line ad read: "They say that IBM's Entry Into Minicomputers Will Legitimize the Market ... The Bastards Say, Welcome." As the budding Intel-Nvidia war develops, we're sure to see shots flying back and forth – maybe we'll even see an Informix-Oracle-like billboard fight like we did in the 1990s? The Highway 101 billboard owners should start writing their proposals now... ® Sponsored: The state of mobile security maturity Tips and corrections 6 Comments Whitepapers OpenStack brings agility to cloud platforms FICO needed an agile platform to provide its analytic cloud services to mid-sized businesses.

ITProPortal Search RSS News Features Analysis Guides Reviews Categories Business Hardware Security Software Mobile Enterprise Cloud Networks Public Sector Startups Web Intel's reveals silicon photonics module for data centres By Anthony Spadafora Shares In order to speed up the way in which data is moved across data centres, Intel has revealed a new silicon photonics product that will be able to move data at much greater speeds than currently possible. The company's new PSM4 silicon photonics module will be able to deliver 100 gigabits per second across a range of two kilometres. This will enable data to be shared at higher speeds across data centres. Intel has been working for years to combine electronics and optical components onto a single piece of silicon as this will simplify both the production process and at the same time will lower its manufacturing costs. The PSM4 was revealed at the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco by executive vice president and general manager of Intel's Data Center Group Diane Bryant. Bryant acknowledged the work that Intel has put into developing this new module, saying: “Electrons running over network cables won't cut it. Intel has been working on silicon photonics over 16 years. We are the first to light up silicon.” This new technology is quite different than other ways of delivering data which often rely on optical technology. However, optical is more difficult to manufacture and is much more expensive to produce than products created using silicon. Intel's PSM4 silicon photonics module uses a hybrid laser to achieve its high data transfer speeds. Bryant also pointed out that data centre traffic is doubling every 12 months due to increased demand as more and more businesses have shifted to the cloud. Intel is working on more than connecting servers via optics and Bryant noted that eventually “optics will be required into the server as well”.

Remember the good old days of counting processor frequencies and, well, blue screens? Looks like the Wintel club is back with the two companies--Microsoft and Intel--announcing that they will collaborate on a "mixed-reality platform" for Windows 10. That effort supported by new depth-sensing cameras from Intel injected excitement into the keynote at the annual Intel Developer Forum here, but fell short of defining a new Wintel platform of the magnitude of the declining PC. Project Alloy Intel will contribute a wireless head-mounted display to the effort, making its hardware and software freely available late next year. Project Alloy uses Intel’s RealSense 3D cameras to enable users to move with six degrees of freedom and use their hands to control virtual spaces. In a demo of Alloy, a user walked among virtual rooms. Typical of the state of such systems, the user had difficulty at one point pushing a large virtual button with hands that often appeared pixelated. However, later he was able to use his finger as a tool to shape a virtual object turning on a virtual lathe. At an event in Shenzhen in December, Microsoft will release the specification for the Win 10 mixed-reality platform. Updates to the operating system next year will let all Windows 10 PCs run what it calls holographic applications for its HoloLens headset. Microsoft and Intel share a common vision of mixed virtual and augmented reality systems as a key direction for client computing, said Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich. Krzanich: Intel will make the Project Alloy headset available as open source next year. (Image: EE Times) “We think this is going to be big because it’s so different than anything that’s out there today,” said Krzanich, noting the Intel headset doesn’t require a room to be outfitted with sensors. “Since the introduction of the PC nothing has so fundamentally redefined computing. VR has gone mainstream in a fundamental shift in how we work play and communicate,” he said.   Next: Injecting Realsense into products » Tech Watch Intel Microsoft Processors/Controllers Computing Consumer Electronics Embedded Systems Communications CMOS electronics, Si-photonics integration targets 1Tb/s Interviews Virtual reality: A killer app in more ways than one Automotive Laser beam steering targets scanning LIDAR systems IoT Transceiver operates in unlicensed sub-1GHz band Computing Machine learning may be Intel’s critical inflection point Back to Top Connect with us Facebook Twitter Get quick access News & Trends Photo Gallery Blogs Video Tutorials Webinars PDF Downloads Vendor Resource Centres Archived Technical Articles Archived Blogs Contact Us Visit our network sites Mainland China EET China EDN China ESM China Robotics China China Technology Forums DatasheetsChina.com Taiwan EE Times Taiwan EDN Taiwan Rest of Asia EE Times Asia EE Times India EE Times Japan EDN Asia EDN Japan US & Europe EE Times US EE Times Europe EDN US Datasheets.com Copyright © 2016 eMedia Asia Ltd.

Now while the smartphones will start selling in India by the end of this month, the ZenBook 3 will only arrive here in Q4. The ZenBook 3 is priced at Rs 1,47,999 which makes it a laptop to consider for a niche audience who want the absolute best internal components while having a light and portable form factor. The Zenbook 3 looks quite elegant in terms of design. It comes in three colours – Royal Blue, Rose Gold and Quartz Grey – each of which has a golden coloured chamfering going around the edges. The keypad covers the entire horizontal length when you open the flap, and the speaker section is present just above the keyboard. The track pad which comes with a layer of glass, comes in two variants – one is a plain trackpad and the higher end one comes with a fingerprint scanner for one-touch login. The keypad was quite responsive and offers a decent amount of travel. Asus has also managed to put in a 3mm fan under the hood to ensure that the temperatures of the Intel Core processors remain under check. If there was one thing we did not like, then it was the presence of just a single USB Type C port. Specially considering this ultrabook comes with full desktop-class graphics. Unless Asus is planning to bundle a boat load of accessories for free with the Zenbook 3, it still carries forth the same major flaw that has been there in the Macbook as well. We are still way too dependent on things such as an extra USB port for mouse and an SD card slot for transferring photos from your digital cameras (not all cameras out there are Wi-fi enabled) and so on. Considering we are seeing a lot of premium laptops in a slim form factor off late, we decided to compare the ZenBook 3 with the HP Spectre and Dell XPS 13 which are high performance slim form factor Windows 10 based laptops. We also added the Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch (with Retina Display) to the mix as it makes a lot more sense than the Intel Core m series sporting Apple MacBook which is more closer in form factor to the ZenBook 3. Asus ZenBook 3 HP Spectre Dell XPS 13 Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch (Retina Display) Price Rs 1,47,999 Rs 1,19,900 Rs 1,35,990 Rs 1,46,900 Weight 0.91 kg 1.11 kg 1.29 kg 1.58 kg Dimensions 296 x 191.2 x 11.9 mm 32 x 229 x 10.4 mm 304 x 200 x 15 mm 314 x 219 x 18 mm Processor Intel Core i7 7500U Intel Core i7 6500U Intel Core i7 6560U 5th gen Intel Core i5 RAM 16GB LPDDR3 8GB LPDDR3 8GB LPDDR3 8GB LPDDR3 Graphics Intel HD Graphics Intel HD Graphics 520 Intel Iris Graphics 540 Intel Iris Graphics 6100 Display Size 12.5-inch LED backlit LCD 13.3-inch LED backlit LCD 13.3-inch InfinityEdge touch 13.3-inch LED backlight LCD with IPS panel Display Resolution 1920 x 1080 1920 x 1080 3200 x 1800 2560 x 1600 Storage 512GB PCIe SSD 512GB PCIe SSD 256GB PCIe SSD 512GB PCIe SSD Ports 1x audio jack, 1x USB Type C 3x USB Type C, 1x audio jack 2x USB 3.0, 1x USB Type C, 1x SD card slot 2x Thunderbolt 2 ports, 2x USB 3.0, 1x audio jack, 1x SDXC card slot, 1x HDMI port Operating System Windows 10 Home / Pro Windows 10 Home Windows 10 Home OS X El Capitan Battery 40WHr 38WHr 56WHr 74.9WHr The one immediate advantage that the ZenBook 3 has over competition is the presence of the latest 7th generation Intel Core i7 processor and it comes with 16GB of RAM which is double that found in all its competitors. At 910 grams, the ZenBook 3 is also the lightest notebook in the list. The thinnest laptop however is the HP Spectre which has created quite a buzz since its launch, for the slim form factor. HP has also managed to cram in an Intel Core i7 processor with 8GB of RAM and 512GB PCIe SSD. It offers a 13.3-inch full HD form factor which is a more traditional size. But it has the lowest battery capacity among the others, which could be a matter of concern. The Dell XPS and the MacBook Pro offer high resolution displays which certainly gives them an edge. The Dell XPS 13 with its InfiniteEdge display offers a unique proposition. The MacBook Pro offers the highest battery capacity, and has many more ports for the working professional as compared to other laptops. Technically, the MacBook should have been in this list since it offers similar form factor and weight, but since it is based on the Intel Core m platform, it would have been a bit unfair to compare it with the ZenBook 3 which is much more powerful. Barring the ZenBook 3, all the other laptops are currently selling in India. While the MacBook Pro 13-inch has been a proven consistent player, the real interesting battle is between the three Windows 10 laptops. At such thin form factors, heat management becomes a prime area of concern. Specially so, when you consider that these laptops house an Intel Core i7 processor inside. So it would be quite difficult to gauge which laptop is better than the other just based on looking at the specifications. We will need to do thorough testing of all the laptops and compare not just benchmark scores, but take a look at heat management and battery life of these laptops. The Dell XPS 13 is already being tested as we write this, so its review should be out soon. Do check back for the full review. Asus has not yet given the exact launch date for the ZenBook 3, so we will have to wait till the end of the year for that. In that time gap, if HP Spectre, Dell XPS 13 and Apple MacBook Pro 13.3-inch get a price drop, then it will make things that much more difficult for the ZenBook 3, unless it offers mind-blowing performance. We will have to reserve our verdict till then.

Intel rule a little too supreme lately. I love my i7, but it's about time some real competition gets prices down a little again. I'm waiting for the Zen market introduction, and am very curious about overclocking potential. Intel CPUs pretty much all go up to 50% above stock clock on all cores pretty easily. I hope AMD can match that. Back in the day Athlons were good, but stock performance was much closer to the maximum ceiling than with stock Intel. Intel has a real good overclocking history. The first CPU I ever overclocked was actually accidental. A 200 MHz Pentium MMX, by error set to 250 MHz. Not a single problem with that. Then again there were AMD K6 CPUs that happily went from stock 400 MHz to 600.     LesserHellspawn View Public Profile Find all posts by LesserHellspawn   (#28) pimpineasy Member Guru     Videocard: iGPU R7 720mhz 384 cores Processor: AMD APU A8-7600 45w Mainboard: ASRock A88M-G/3.1 Memory: Corsair 8 gb 2133mhz Soundcard: Realtek PSU: Evga 500w 08-18-2016, 20:16 | posts: 114 | Location: Sacramento, CA i suggest anyone waiting to upgrade continue to do so things like usb type c are gonna start rolling out on smart phones. their finally pushing all the new features to the mobo.     pimpineasy View Public Profile Find all posts by pimpineasy   (#29) Lane Ancient Guru   Videocard: 2x HD7970 - EK Waterblock Processor: I7 4930K H2o EK Supremacy Mainboard: Asus X79 Deluxe Memory: G-Skill C9 2133mhz 16GB Soundcard: X-FI Titanium HD + SP2500 PSU: CM 1000W 08-18-2016, 20:41 | posts: 6,251 | Location: Switzerland Quote: Originally Posted by LesserHellspawn I'm pretty happy about this.

There are exceptions both up or down, but I believe that there is a ceiling for Intel designs at least. I would expect the 8/16 Zen to be at around 3.8-.4.2GHz. If the IPC is indeed better than Broadwell-E, the platform is compelling and the prices are "right", AMD will have a winner.     PrMinisterGR View Public Profile Find all posts by PrMinisterGR   (#33) jura11 Maha Guru     Videocard: Titan X SC GTX 1080 AMP!

Not sure what you're implying about rebadged CPUs...     schmidtbag View Public Profile Find all posts by schmidtbag   (#46) pimpineasy Member Guru     Videocard: iGPU R7 720mhz 384 cores Processor: AMD APU A8-7600 45w Mainboard: ASRock A88M-G/3.1 Memory: Corsair 8 gb 2133mhz Soundcard: Realtek PSU: Evga 500w 08-19-2016, 06:20 | posts: 114 | Location: Sacramento, CA sweet !! $200 32 core / 64 thread for all!!     pimpineasy View Public Profile Find all posts by pimpineasy   (#47) PrMinisterGR Ancient Guru     Videocard: Sapphire 7970 Quadrobake Processor: Core i7 2600k@4.5GHz Mainboard: Sapphire Pure Black P67 Memory: Corsair Vengeance 16GB Soundcard: ASUS Xonar D2X PSU: EVGA SuperNova 750 G2 08-19-2016, 07:08 | posts: 5,228 Quote: Originally Posted by pimpineasy sweet !! $200 32 core / 64 thread for all!!

I don't think it will be quite as simple, simply due to fact of Intel's installation base in the consumer/gamer/enthusiast market. Offering i5/7 6600~6900(K) performance a for a bit less than Intel's counterpart is great in theory but the installation basis of those intel CPUs in the respective segments may be far too large already to do any good to AMD. It may be interesting to 2500/3570 owners that didn't make the jump yet but AMD has likely to do a bit better than merely taking a few bucks off the price tag to warrant a whole platform change.     moeppel View Public Profile Find all posts by moeppel   (#49) Ryu5uzaku Ancient Guru     Videocard: 980ti gaming 1490/7700 Processor: 3770K @ 4.4 stock voltage Mainboard: z68 crap Memory: 16GB Soundcard: Meridian 2G PSU: 850W SF platinum 08-19-2016, 08:24 | posts: 6,208 | Location: Finland If Zen indeed does beat broadwell-e it will be worth the investment from me.

AMD will be doubling the CPU thread count, stepping up against Intel's HyperThreading technology with the new Zen-based range of processors. There's also a high bandwidth and low latency caching system that will be used to "feed the beast", thanks to the 14nm process we're looking at greater power efficiency and a nice speed boost of 40% more instructions per clock (IPC).   If you don't think the 40% increase in IPC is real, Ryan Shrout from PCPer says "AMD proved to me today that the claims are real and that we will see the immediate impact of that architecture bump from day one". I've been hearing internal rumblings that Zen is underpromised right now, and will have even more performance - and now that Shrout has had AMD prove the performance of Zen to him, my excitement meter has just shifted further into 'please, can I have it now'.   There are some big changes to the Zen architecture, with branch prediction completely overhauled, and this is the first AMD processor to feature micro-op cache. Shrout adds: "Wider execution width with broader instruction schedulers are integrated, all of which adds up to much higher instruction level parallelism to improve single threaded performance".     AMD has used an integrated 8MB of L3 cache, with prefetching improved with up to 5x the cache bandwidth per CPU core. SMT is there to make sure the pipeline is filled, where "bubbles" that latency arrives in and lower efficiency are prevented, while AMD has also used region-specific power gating that will see Zen-powered notebooks be very powerful, and power efficient, too.   AMD was comparing its new 8-core, 16-thread "Summit Ridge" processor against Intel's ridiculously expensive 8-core/16-thread "Broadwell-E" processor - the Core i7-6900K. AMD compared the IPC improvements of Zen, by using a rendering workload that finished 1-2 seconds faster than the 6900K. Impressive stuff.   There's no pricing information or finalized clock speeds just yet, but it looks like we can begin to get genuinely excited about AMD processors again.

We’re just not sure the Z83 can compete in it." Price $247 AUD > Pricing info Specs Intel Atom x5-Z8300 1.4GHz • Intel HD Graphics • 2GB RAM• 32GB • Windows 10 Home • 802.11ac Wi-Fi, SD expansion slot • 2x USB 2.0 • USB 3.0 • HDMI, 3.5mm audio Tweet Email this Print this Feedback If another nano-PC is released in a forest of nano-PCs... does anyone notice? Our somewhat qualified appreciation of the Intel Compute Stick - the teeny PC that looks like a big thumb drive with an HDMI plug instead of a USB - was documented recently (PCTA 221, p57). We liked the device, but pointed out the Atom x5-Z8300 CPU and 2GB of RAM limited its uses somewhat. What also limits the flexibility of the Compute Stick is the form-factor itself. There’s only room for two USB ports and one micro-SD slot. And for networking, it relies entirely on Wi-Fi or (*shudder*) a USB-to-Ethernet dongle. However, thanks to an odd website called gearbest.com where everything is always on sale but the sale is always in its last hours, you can now get this: The Mini PC Z83. Or possibly Z83 Mini PC, or Z83 TV Box Intel Atom, the nomenclature isn’t 100% clear. Cheekily packaged in a plain brown box with almost-but-not-quite-Intel-official fonts and graphic design elements, the Z83 is the size of two packs of cards sitting side-by-side. Like the Compute Stick, it uses the x5-Z8300 1.4GHz Atom, it has 2GB of DDR3 RAM, and an included license of Windows 10 Home takes up about a third of its 32GB internal storage.  But unlike the Compute Stick, the Z83 rocks three USB ports (still only one USB3.0 though), a full-sized SD card slot, a headphone jack and a full-sized Ethernet port. Perhaps more significantly, it’s passively cooled so there’s no irritating little fan waiting to spin up during a tense dramatic moment. That’s assuming you’re using this thing as some kind of HTPC, because it does come with a back-of-the-TV-or-monitor mounting bracket. Apart from those form-factor differences though, the spec of the Z83 is so similar to the Compute Stick, we wondered if it WAS one, just in a bigger box. So out came the spudgers and teeny screwdrivers, and we discovered that in fact the box isn’t just for show: this machine sits on a much larger PCB than Intel’s teeny pooter, and has a nice big heatsink covering the CPU and memory. The heatsink appears copper but is actually just aluminium painted copper. That kind of defines the build-quality of the Z83 through and through. It’s not terrible, but it’s not exactly premium either.  It is very carefully designed to look like an official Intel product though, and it isn’t. Don’t let ‘em fool you! "this machine sits on a much larger PCB than Intel’s teeny  pooter ,  and has a nice big heatsink covering the CPU and memory." With two USB2.0 ports on one side and one USB3.0 on the other, the Z83 is reasonably flexible. You can attach both a wired mouse and keyboard directly, leaving the USB3.0 port free.  The 3.5mm audio jack is a slightly baffling inclusion since the only video output is HDMI (which carries audio of course) but it does give speaker options should you decide to use this little machine as a desktop. Like so many of these atom-based mini-machines, the Z83 sacrifices a sizeable chunk of its 32GB onboard storage to Windows 10 Home. Which runs okay. It would be interesting to know what the price-break is that means these PCs all have 2GB RAM rather than 4GB. Even my smartphone has 4GB of RAM.  Like the Compute Stick, the Z83’s biggest competition is the Google Chromecast and the Apple TV... not to mention the apps on all modern TVs (which suck, but at the palatable price of “free with the TV”). Both TV boxes from the tech giants are getting more and more capable and surely can’t be far from releasing 4K versions. They’re seamlessly supported with your preferred smartphone, and the Chromecast is just $59.  An Apple TV will set you back $269 these days which is kind of insane, but maybe you’re one of the very specific group of people who reject Apple on pricing grounds, but also Google on... tax avoidance grounds? I dunno. Gearbest advertises the Z83 as having a regular price of $247, which is too much. But it also seems to be perennially on sale for $119 (with a European plug) which is almost tempting. That’s not much money at all for a “full” PC with enough graphical grunt to run a desktop, 1980s and 1990s videogame emulators, and full HD video in any format you can convince Windows to decode. Like the Compute Stick, the 2GB of RAM holds it back. But the Z83 is cheaper and more flexible. And there’s no fan. We place a pretty high value on silence. But here’s the kicker. The Z83 is one of dozens of new teeny-PCs. They’re all about the same size (deck of cards) and some even run Android. There’s even a super-sexy silver unit called a VOYO V2 that has 64GB of storage, a 5000mAh battery, and claims 4K output... for  $150.  It’s a weird new world. We’re just not sure the Z83 can compete in it.   Product link: http://www.gearbest.com/tv-box-mini-pc/pp_343636.html     This Review appeared in the July 2016 issue of PC & Tech Authority Magazine Related Reviews Review: Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1070 Xtreme Gaming Review: Fitbit Flex 2 keeps you fit without hurting your wallet Review: Dell XPS 8910 Mini-Tower desktop PC Review: the HP Spectre couldn't be any more lux if it tried Review: Sony MDR-1000X headphones Source: Copyright © PC & Tech Authority.

Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) Aug 18, 2016 at 5:17PM Image source: Getty Images. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) are both betting that deep learning is going to fuel everything from cloud computing to driverless cars -- and the rivalry is already starting to heat up.  Intel said recently that its new Knights Landing Xeon Phi processors are faster and can be scaled better than graphics processing units (GPUs) that NVIDIA makes. Unsurprisingly, NVIDIA didn't take too kindly to the comparison. The company wrote a blog post in response, saying that it needed to correct a few of Intel's "mistakes," and took a jab at the company, saying, "It's understandable that newcomers to the field may not be aware of all the developments that have been taking place in both hardware and software." Them's fightin' words in the semiconductor business!  Essentially, NVIDIA said that Intel's data was 18 months old, and pointed out that the new data (available to anyone) shows that NVIDIA's Maxwell GPUs are actually 30% faster than Intel's Xeon Phi.  The company also highlighted that its new Titan X server with its advanced Pascal architecture is actually about two times faster than Intel's new processors, and its DGX-1 supercomputer is is five times faster.  There's really not much up for debate here, considering that NVIDIA is using the same data source and standards that Intel is using, but with just the most recent numbers. Why this actually matters Here's why Intel and NVIDIA are taking off the gloves: The entire deep-learning market (including software, services, and hardware) is expected to surpass $100 billion in annual revenue by 2024. And right now NVIDIA is becoming increasingly important in the space. NVIDIA's CEO, Jen-Hsun Huang, said back in April that "deep learning is no longer just an app, not just a field. We think this is so important, we think this is going to utterly change computing. We think it's a big deal."  Many tech companies are already using NVIDIA's GPUs to build their own machine-learning (part of artificial intelligence) computers. For example, Facebook uses NVIDIA's Tesla M40 GPUs for its Big Sur machine-learning computers. NVIDIA has started marketing some of its GPUs, like the Tesla P100, more to the enterprise market for corporate data centers, and that's likely to increase as server and cloud-computing tasks become more complex. And the company's DGX-1 deep-learning supercomputer is marketed to enterprise customers looking for serious data processing. NVIDIA saw 112% year-over-year growth from its data center revenue in Q2 2017, driven in part by deep learning. Meanwhile, Intel's own data center growth was just 5% over the same period.  Intel's fighting to keep itself relevant in an industry that's increasingly pivoting toward GPUs for deep learning. That's likely the reason it used old NVIDIA specs to compare its new processors to. Intel's latest Xeon Phi processors are certainly serious competition for NVIDIA, and will likely create very good deep-learning machines. But I still think investors would be remiss to look past NVIDIA's growing position in the space.  Chris Neiger has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple Invents an Energy Harvesting Component to Augment Battery Power for iOS Devices | Main | Apple Continues their Work on Delivering an Augmented Reality Display for Mobile Devices » August 18, 2016 Apple's 3D Depth Camera Team Invent a new Miniaturized Hybrid Scanning Module   Intel's RealSense Camera is one, if not the industry's first 3D depth camera being incorporated into PC's and mobile devices that incorporate a depth scanner. When you go to Intel's RealSense webpage, the first thing you'll see on the page is a clear statement that reads: 'Imagine, Create. Scan. Share.' It's the technology behind Windows Hello, which is a Windows 10 feature that allows a display with a RealSense camera to use facial recognition to assist a user to login without typing in a password. And the scanner is lighting fast. Today, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office published a patent application from Apple that derived from their Israeli PrimeSense team. They were legendary for their 3D depth cameras that were used in Microsoft's Kinect device. And now, we may see their first 3D camera land on the iPhone 7 in September and later in the year on the iPad and/or iPad Pro. Today's patent application covers their latest miniaturized hybrid scanning module.      Apple's patent FIG. 1 is a schematic, pictorial illustration of a scanning device comprising a hybrid scanning module; FIG. 2 is a schematic rear view of the scanning module of FIG. 1; and FIG. 4 is a schematic, pictorial illustration of an alternative hybrid scanning module using a single larger mirror instead of two smaller mirrors.   The patent filing reveals several patents are being incorporated into this newest filing under number 20160238834. One of the incorporated patents describes "a scanning depth engine, which includes a transmitter, which emits a beam comprising pulses of light, and a scanner, which is configured to scan the beam, within a predefined scan range, over a scene."   The scanner may comprise a micromirror produced using MEMS technology. A receiver receives the light reflected from the scene and generates an output indicative of the time of flight of the pulses to and from points in the scene. A processor is coupled to control the scanner and to process the output of the receiver so as to generate a 3D map of the scene – just as our cover graphic is conveying.   The patent is a highly technical one describing their latest hybrid scanner module invention in depth and you could review it in full here. Apple filed for this patent in Q1 2015. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office. Readers are cautioned that the full text of any patent application should be read in its entirety for full and accurate details.

Intel and ARM in recent years have become serious rivals in different sectors of the processor market. Intel has failed to make much headway into a mobile chip space dominated by ARM and its partners, while ARM has been trying to gain traction in data centers where Intel silicon powers more than 95 percent of servers. Now, these two rivals are coming together in a partnership that promises to benefit both companies. At the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco Aug. 16, officials from both vendors announced that Intel's chip foundry business will build processors chips for mobile and consumer devices based on ARM's architecture. The agreement will boost Intel's custom manufacturing business, which the company has been building for the past few years, by adding intellectual property from ARM whose chip architecture powers almost all of the smartphones and tablets in the world. Intel officials may be reducing the chip maker's dependence on the stagnant PC market, but that doesn't mean they've given up on the systems. During his keynote address in San Francisco on Aug. 16 on the opening day of the Intel Developer Forum, CEO Brian Krzanich showed off systems running on the company's upcoming seventh-Generation Core "Kaby Lake" chips, boasting of the processors' abilities to smoothly run 4K videos and 3D applications, thanks to integrated graphics capabilities. In addition, Krzanich also showed a two-in-one system from HP Inc. powered by the new processors, which showed how quickly PCs powered by the chips can run such demanding workloads as editing high-resolution 4K video from a GoPro camera. Instead of taking advantage of some the power user- and developer-friendly features included in this month's Windows 10 Anniversary Update, some PC owners were instead greeted by unresponsive hardware. "Microsoft has received a small number of reports of Windows 10 freezing after installing the Anniversary Update on systems with the operating system stored on a solid-state drive and apps and data stored on a separate drive," wrote a Microsoft forum moderator on Aug. 10. "This issue does not occur when starting Windows 10 in Safe Mode. "Alternately, users can revert to the previous version of Windows 10, an option that remains available for 10 days after the update is applied. Step by step instructions are available in this Microsoft support forum thread. Apple has committed to building a research and development facility in China, a number of sources have reported. Apple CEO Tim Cook, during his ninth visit to China, met with senior government officials this week and promised to increase investment in the country. An Apple spokesperson said that the R&D facility will open this year and focus on developing new products and "strengthening relationships with local partners and universities," according to The Wall Street Journal. While China had been a fast-growing market for Apple, during the company's most recent fiscal quarter sales in China were down 33 percent.       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

SAN FRANCISCO—Intel last week took a significant step in the artificial intelligence space with the planned acquisition of startup Nervana Systems, a move that will give it software designed for the crucial task of machine learning. At the Intel Developer Forum (IDF) here Aug. 17, company officials said they will continue their efforts to make the chip maker's x86 products the foundational silicon for the job of training the neural networks driving the development of artificial intelligence (AI). Diane Bryant, executive vice president and general manager of Intel's Data Center Group, said the company next year will release a new version of its many-core Xeon Phi processors—dubbed "Knights Mill"—which will be crucial in competing with GPUs from Nvidia in the machine-learning (ML) task of training. Intel also got a nod from Chinese internet giant Baidu, which will use the Knights Mill chips in its data centers as part of its "deep speech" platform for its speech recognition efforts. The combination of Knights Mill—a derivative of the current Xeon Phi Knights Landing chip aimed at the AI space—and the presence of Baidu on the IDF stage is another boost for Intel as it looks to gain more traction in the rapidly growing AI and machine learning space, according to Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst with Moor Insights and Strategy. Bryant didn't give much in the way of details about Knights Mill, but Moorhead said the focus on such capabilities as enhanced variable precision means the company is moving in the right direction. Other features for Knights Mill listed by Intel include improved efficiency, flexible and high-capacity memory, and the fact that it's being built for scale-out environments. Having Baidu—part of the group of major hyperscale players that Intel has dubbed the "Super 7" and which also includes such vendors as Google, Facebook, Amazon and Alibaba—come out in support of the effort also was important, he said. "It was the first time Intel has had someone from the Super 7 on stage and talking about AI and ML and Xeon Phi," the analyst told eWEEK. Intel is well-positioned to be the dominant force in the AI and machine learning space, Bryant said. In 2015, 7 percent of all servers were running data analytics workloads. By 2020, more than half will. In addition, 97 percent of all machine-learning tasks run on Intel silicon, she said. Current AI workloads include such jobs as image recognition and fraud detection, but the industry promises huge growth in the coming years. She and other officials also said that those workloads also run best on Intel CPUs. Nidhi Chappell, director of machine learning with Intel's Analytics Platform Group, told eWEEK that the company with its Xeon and Xeon Phi server chips not only has the best silicon for deep learning—a subset of machine learning—but that engineers are ensuring that all the parts of the software stack—much of which is open-source—needed for AI are optimized to run on those chips. In addition, Chappell noted that most machine-learning tasks are linear workloads, which Intel has been processing for decades. "There's nothing inherent about neural networks that lends themselves [to be best used by] GPUs," she said.

Intel's new Atom chips for cars and IoT could shed ugly mobile past The next-generation of Atom chips will be detailed at Intel Developer Forum next week Agam Shah (IDG News Service) on 12 August, 2016 03:44 0 - - - - print email Intel's Atom chips are on their way out of mobile devices, and the next generation of the chip line will instead be targeted toward drones, self-driving cars, and IoT devices. The new Atom chips will retain the line's focus on low power consumption, with an emphasis on graphics and visual computing. The chip line, to be announced next week at Intel Developer Forum, will be used to maneuver cars, drones, and robots and to also help them recognize objects. Many Atom mobile and server chips have been on Intel's chopping block. The troubled chip's future now is in the growing markets of IoT and virtual reality. The chips will integrate into devices with the company's 3D RealSense cameras, according to a technical session description at IDF. That points to the chips also being used in low-power virtual reality headsets. Intel will lay out its VR and augmented reality strategy at the developer show, and RealSense is expected to be at the center of many announcements. Intel will show off its own version of Microsoft's HoloLens called Remote EyeSight, a set of head-worn AR smart glasses for remote collaboration. Expect the bread-and-butter products for the new Atom chips to be smart home and industrial IoT devices. The chips, according to the technical session page, will also work in devices with "advanced displays," which could refer to information kiosks or digital advertising displays. Intel declined to comment on the next-generation Atom chips, the details, or the underlying architecture. The chips could be based on the Broxton architecture, conceived by Intel originally as a way to quickly design and release new Atom chips to catch up with market leader ARM in smartphones and tablets. The new chips ensure the survival of the Atom product line, which had an uncertain future. Atom chips for mobile devices were the first on the chopping block after Intel announced plans earlier this year to lay off 12,000 employees and restructure operations to focus on servers, connectivity, IoT, and other areas. However, Intel is still using Atom chips like Sofia -- which it was supposed to cut -- for point-of-sale systems and industrial IoT devices. The Atom architecture called Goldmont will be used in upcoming Celeron and Pentium PC chips code-named Apollo Lake. Those chips were originally based on the same architecture used in high-end Core PC processors. The new Atom chips could go into AC power-connected devices for digital signs, cash registers, and casino gaming machines, said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. "It won't be for small, battery devices," McGregor said. Intel's done a good job of scaling down the size and power consumption for x86 architecture with Atom, but the chip isn't as power efficient as ARM or MIPS for low-power devices, McGregor said. Atom, in a way, is coming back to embedded devices -- which it was originally designed for -- but an ill-advised mobile route has given the chip a bad name, McGregor said. "They have to rebrand it. There's so much failure around it," McGregor said. The Atom chips were at the forefront of the netbook explosion from 2007 to 2010, then were tweaked for tablets and smartphones. Atom smartphones never really took off, and in a desperate move, Intel in 2014 said it would ship 40 million tablet chips, then hit 46 million chips. But by the time Intel found its groove in tablets, that market started declining.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Aug 18, 2016 at 8:47AM Image source: Intel.  At its annual developer forum, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) disclosed quite a lot of information about its current and future chip manufacturing technologies, something that was sorely needed after a long stretch of essentially radio silence. There is a lot of ground to cover here as the presentation that the company gave was packed to the brim with goodies. Let's get to it. Say hello to 14+ One topic that Intel talked about was the development of "derivative technologies" based on current manufacturing technologies. These derivative technologies, according to Intel, are "becoming more common to enhance performance and/or expand feature set." The first such derivative technology that Intel is announcing (or, at the very least, bothering to brand for investors' sake) is 14+. This is a technology that includes enhancements to both the transistor as well as the metal stack to yield a performance improvement of 12%. This process is what the company's upcoming Kaby Lake family of processors as well as, I assume, the company's second generation of 14-nanometer server processors slated for launch in 2017, will be built on. Three waves of 10-nanometer Intel says that there will be three waves of its future 10-nanometer technology: 10, 10+, and 10++. These, the company says, will "support multiple new leading-edge products." This means that even though Intel will be "stuck" on its 10-nanometer technology for three product generations, the company should be able to wring out additional manufacturing-related performance enhancements on top of product-level architectural improvements. Intel claims significant density advantage over competition One metric that Intel has talked quite a lot about is the logic area density of its manufacturing technologies relative to competing technologies from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung Electronics (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF). The idea is that the more tightly a company can pack transistors (what chips are made of), the more features and functionality it can cram into a fixed chip area. Here's the slide that Intel showed comparing its technologies with those from its competition: Image source: Intel. According to the company, its 14-nanometer technology -- using the metric of transistor gate pitch multiplied by logic cell height -- is a little less dense than competitors' upcoming 10-nanometer manufacturing technologies. Intel's own 10-nanometer technology, per this comparison, will be dramatically ahead of the competition in this metric (though it's worth noting that Intel's 10-nanometer technology should come a bit later than the competitions'). Although I believe that Intel will be able to maintain a solid transistor density lead over Samsung, the competitive picture vis-à-vis TSMC is a little less clear. Though it is true that Intel's 10-nanometer should be quite a bit denser than TSMC's 10-nanometer, TSMC has indicated that it will transition to its 7-nanometer technology in the first half of 2018. TSMC claims that its 7-nanometer technology will bring both performance and area enhancements relative to 10-nanometer, so I expect the gap, at the very least with respect to transistor area, to narrow relative to Intel's 10-nanometer technology. Whether TSMC closes the gap or not, remains to be seen. I suspect, though, that any sustained advantage that Intel will be able to build over TSMC won't necessarily be in terms of transistor area but, instead, in transistor performance as the company iterates through its 10, 10+, and 10++ technologies. What does this mean for the business?  At the end of the day, it's Intel's job to build compelling products for the various markets that it serves. Yearly performance improvements in manufacturing technology should allow the company to release better and faster products each year, allowing it to gain share in new areas (such as the Internet of Things and networking) while defending its position in areas where it's already strong (personal computers, servers).  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | August 18, 2016 -- 19:01 GMT (12:01 PDT) | Topic: Data Centers Krzanich believes cloud and connected devices to be the future of Intel Image: AP/Intel Fresh off of Intel's acquisition of Altera, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich on Thursday said that Intel plans to put its brand on the Stratix 10 FPGA processor, making it the first of Intel's 14nm silicon technologies. Who really owns your Internet of Things data? In a world where more and more objects are coming online and vendors are getting involved in the supply chain, how can you keep track of what's yours and what's not? Read More "It's going better than expected, and we're confident we're going to ship to customers by the end of this year," Krzanich said at the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco. Noting that the Stratix 10 delivers up to 10 teraflops of single precision floating point performance, he added, "This thing is a beast." Krzanich stressed that FPGAs will be central to the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem as workloads like machine learning and packet management become more important. "Putting the software down onto the silicon and using the FPGA as an accelerator of these workloads is critical," he said. The CEO also addressed the "four concerns" he hears about regarding the Altera acquisition. First, he said that Intel is "absolutely committed" to the FPGA business and plans to grow the business within Altera at an even faster rate than it's currently growing. He also stressed that Intel can support long product life cycles. Next, Krzanich promised that customers' level of service will not change, noting that Altera will remain a separate business group, with separate sales and support. At the same time, he said Altera will be able to "leverage all the assets of Intel" and is benefiting from a "good cross-pollination of engineers and technologists." Lastly, he said he is taking a "very pragmatic" approach to products built on ARM cores. "I'm about providing customers what they need," he said. "I can commit to you... any product built on an ARM core will continue as long as that ARM core is what's required to win the business and build the product."

The small chip company has brought giants like Intel to their knees in the realm of mobile phones and tablets, and now it's on the verge of being acquired by Softbank for a stunning US$32 billion. You may not know it, but outside of PCs ARM is in almost every device we use, from smartphones to TVs to home appliances. It licenses chip designs to manufacturers, and over the last 25 years, over 90 billion ARM-designed chips have gone into devices. ARM will continue designing processors for various segments of the computing industry after the acquisition, but investments will go up and product development will be faster, said Simon Segars, CEO of ARM, in a video. Here are three immediate things you need to know about the deal. Your iPhone or iPad won't be affected Apple's A-series smartphone chips for the iPhone and iPad are based on ARM architecture. Apple will look at the proposed acquisition closely with regard to their mobile chip future, but it will likely retain ARM architecture. For ARM, Apple has been a marquee customer that can highlight the chip architecture's capabilities. But Apple also has nowhere else to go now that Intel -- which was ARM's major mobile competitor -- has quit making mobile processors. An alternative is the struggling MIPS architecture, whose owner, Imagination Technologies, is reportedly up for sale, but it's doubtful Apple would make that choice. ARM processor designs are also in smartphones from top vendors like Samsung, LG and others. None of them should be affected by the deal. "I'm not expecting any changes because many of their contracts are long-term, tied to specific architectures and products," said Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy. Faster technology development, and cheaper chips and devices After the acquisition, ARM CEO Segars said the company "will do more, we'll do it faster, and we'll do it with a greater degree of investment." That's bad news for Intel, which will suddenly have to contend with a chip company with big financial backing. That competition could lead to faster chip development and cheaper processors, like what happened for PCs and servers when competition between Intel and AMD was at its peak. A big reason Softbank acquired ARM was to expand in the internet of things; Intel laid off 12,000 employees to refocus on IoT and data center products. Cheaper chips could bring down prices for IoT devices and servers, said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. ARM could also scale up development of wireless modems and sensor technology and add much-needed resources to chase servers, a market Intel dominates, McGregor said.

But its chip designs are being used in maker boards like Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone. No Brexit effect Softbank is a Japanese company, but ARM's operations will remain centered in the U.K. The chip designer has 1,600 employees in the U.K., and it will double that head count over the next five years. That's a show of faith in the U.K., which has voted to exit the European Union and has recently suffered currency fluctuations. ARM will also expand operations worldwide after the acquisition, and will be hiring in other countries. ARM has big operations in U.S., China and Taiwan.

One of the challenges faced by engineers when addressing IoT is the task of connecting and managing devices remotely, mainly due to the sheer number of devices which are expected to be in operation over the next few years. Wind River’s Helix Device Cloud, which has been billed as a family wide collaboration, bringing in expertise from Intel Security and the Services business unit, which it claims will enable operators to track device status and content, share data among engineers, and determine in real-time when updates are needed. “The latest release of Device Cloud is a result of dedication, collaboration and innovation across multiple organizations within the Intel family, including Wind River, Intel Security Group, and Intel Services Division,” said Santhosh Nair, IoT Business Leader at Wind River. “This multi-disciplinary team brought together a unique set of skills necessary to solve the tough challenges associated with IoT device management. The result is a differentiated product that is uniquely positioned in the increasingly competitive IoT market. “The IoT vision is quickly becoming reality, as more and more enterprises seek to unlock the value of the data generated by their everyday operations. Utilizing Device Cloud, device manufacturers and IoT solution providers can accelerate device deployment and close a critical gap in IoT operations: ensuring that the devices enterprises depend on are performing as expected.” The new offering is backing the rapid growth of IoT, and the struggles of organizations to deploy, monitor, manage, service, update, and decommission these devices on such a scale. Remote lifecycle management will become an important part of the IoT mix as it will enable engineers to reduce development costs, accelerate deployment timelines, and free resources up to work on business-specific features. When you have thousands or millions of devices in the field, the ability to remotely diagnose and repair devices becomes crucial if IoT is to be commercially successful. Statista estimates the number of IoT devices worldwide will exceed 50 billion by 2020, presenting a significant maintenance problem considering the wide range of environments which are being considered. A remote management system would be paramount to the efficiency and ultimate success of any IoT deployment, with Wind River making some early moves here. 2016 is proving to be an active year for Wind River in the IoT space, as the company has made numerous updates to the offering, as well as announcing a couple of partnerships focused on edge-computing. Back in January Wind River and IBM announced a new partnership to accelerate the development of connected devices in both organizations. As part of the agreement, the pair aim to bring ‘edge-to-cloud’ recipes for customers which blends Watson IoT Cloud Platform with products from the Helix portfolio. Wind River has also been making moves into the autonomous vehicles arena launching the Helix Cockpit, with various features including a connectivity framework help to extend and bridge the car experience to the cloud.

Historically Intel has made good margin from manufacturing its own chips – primarily those used in PCs and servers – in very expensive specialised plants referred to as fabs. But with the PC market in slow decline it seems Intel no longer needs so much fab capacity for its own products and is looking to take on the likes of TSMC and Samsung in the third-party foundry game, which encompasses pretty much the whole mobile market including Qualcomm and Apple. One of the main ways we have been able to extract ever more performance from ever smaller pieces of silicon is the continual shrinking of the manufacturing process, which refers to the size of each individual transistor in the chip. The next major process shrink is to 10 nm and if Intel is serious about becoming a major foundry player it needs to be competitive at this level. Intel has poured billions into becoming a mobile chip player but has never been able to overcome the advantages ARM’s architecture has over its own when it comes to power efficiency – a critical issue in the mobile space. So strong is ARM’s position that even parity would probably never have been enough for Intel and it’s hard to see how any foundry could be competitive without being optimised for ARM physical IP, which is a library of information ARM offers to help with the manufacturing of its chip designs. “Our 10 nm design platform for foundry customers will now offer access to ARM Artisan physical IP, including POP IP, based on the most advanced ARM cores and Cortex series processors,” said co-GM of Intel Custom Foundry Zane Ball. “Optimizing this technology for Intel’s 10 nm process means that foundry customers can take advantage of the IP to achieve best-in-class PPA (power, performance, area) for power-efficient, high-performance implementations of their designs for mobile, IoT and other consumer applications.” “Today’s announcement represents what we expect to be a long-term, mutually beneficial partnership with Intel Custom Foundry,” said GM of ARM’s Physical Design Group Will Abbey. “One of the strengths and differentiators of the Artisan platform is the availability of ARM core-optimized IP – what we call ARM PO technology. The value of POP technology for an ARM core on the Intel 10nm process is tremendous, as it will allow for quicker knowledge transfer, enabling customers to lower their risk in implementing the most advanced ARM cores on Intel’s leading-edge process technology. “Additionally, POP technology enables silicon partners to accelerate the implementation and tape-outs of their ARM-based designs. The initial POP IP will be for two future advanced ARM Cortex-A processor cores designed for mobile computing applications in either ARM big.LITTLE or stand-alone configurations.” Telecoms.com spoke to Sravan Kundojjala, Analyst at Strategy Analytics, to get his take on the news. “This is a smart move by Intel to take on TSMC, Samsung LS and Global Foundries, and the foundry business has good margins, with TSMC operating margin at around 35%,” he said. “The LG and Spreadtrum mobile foundry deals will help Intel fill its fabs in the face of declining PC sales and if successful the company could even land orders from Qualcomm, Apple and MediaTek. “Between 2011 and 2015 Intel spent approximately $15 billion on mobile R&D and approximately $3.5 billion on mobile-related acquisitions without much to show for it, so the latest move could provide a much needed boost to Intel’s mobile ambitions. TSMC and Samsung LSI are likely to beat Intel to market in 10 nm by 5-6 months but Intel could offer a credible foundry alternative.” As Kundojjala said Intel has already announced some foundry deals on the back of this move, including LG, which will start making its own mobile SoCs in partnership with Intel, following the trend established by Apple, Samsung and Huawei, who license ARM designs to make their own chips. Six months seems like a substantial lag in the fast-moving mobile market, however, so Intel will need to compete strongly on price and service too. The announcement came on the opening day of Intel’s annual developer forum – IDF – at which there was several other juicy morsels well covered by Light Reading’s Brian Santo at the event. Among the big announcements were a couple of Virtual Reality initiatives and new NFV collaborations with AT&T and NEC. To some extent this move is also an admission by Intel that ARM is likely to dominate IoT devices in much the same way it has mobile. If anything ARM should be even stronger in IoT as it designs chips all the way down to the simplest microcontrollers and Softbank is betting on exactly that. The IoT boom should yield a lot of foundry business and, regardless of its own chip ambitions, Intel needs to support ARM if it wants some of it.

Code-named Knights Mill, the next processor in the Xeon Phi family is expected to be available in 2017, the company said Wednesday. Diane Bryant, executive VP and general manager of Intel’s Data Center Group, made the announcement at the Intel Developers Forum in San Francisco. As tech giants like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft, as well as Elon Musk’s non-profit OpenAI, are investing enormous sums of money in AI research, fighting tooth-and-nail to attract top minds in the field, a battle to supply hardware for the software those minds will create is nascent. In this battle, Intel is up against the likes of Nvidia, whose GPUs are a popular way to deploy algorithms for machine learning (a common type of AI technology), and the tech giants themselves. Google has developed a custom processor for its machine learning applications on its own, saying nothing was available on the market that met its performance and price requirements. Read more: Google Has Built Its Own Custom Chip for AI Servers Intel has a different set of concerns than Google does when designing its processors for machine learning. It wants to create a general-purpose chip that will support machine learning and other workloads, Charles Wuischpard, VP of the Data Center Group, said on a call with reporters in June, which was the first time the company discussed its AI chip strategy publicly. While he had little familiarity with Google’s Tensor Processing Unit, Wuischpard said it appeared to be a highly specialized part designed for a specific workload. Another big part of Intel’s AI chip strategy is to make it scale out rather than up. The latter is the most common architecture for machine learning, he said, which makes it difficult to scale. Knights Mill “is optimized for scale-out analytics implementations, and will include key enhancements for deep learning training,” Intel said in a statement Wednesday.

Intel reported its second quarter fiscal 2016 financial results on July 20, with revenue of $13.5 billion, for a three percent year-over-year gain. Net income came in at $1.3 billion, with an earnings per share of 27 cents. For more information on Servers Why Lenovo for Hyperconverged? What You Need to Know About Office 365 & Windows 10 A Single-Platform Approach to Desktop and Application Delivery Customer Case Study - Managing Cultural Change when Moving to the Cloud Partner Offers Looking forward, Intel provided third quarter guidance for the midpoint revenue range of $14.9 billion. Looking at specific Intel business units, the Client Computing Group, which builds chips that end up in consumer PCs, had revenue of $7.3 billion for a three percent year-over-year decline. The Data Center Group had revenue going the other way, reporting $4.0 billion for the second quarter, up five percent year-over-year. Demand for Performance Drives Growth in the Data Center "In the data center, we're seeing an ongoing preference for performance up and down the pricing stack," Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said on his company's earnings call. "Average selling prices increased year over year in every microprocessor product segment from Atom and Xeon D SOCs at the low end, up through Xeon and Xeon Phi at the high end." Krzanich added that progress in the data center extended beyond Intel's CPU product lines. Among the other products is the Xeon Phi accelerator, formerly known as Knights Landing, "Xeon Phi revenue grew 8x in the first six months of this year versus all of 2015, gaining share in the supercomputing and machine learning segments," Krzanich said. Another area of data center growth is coming from Intel's Omni-Path high-performance computing fabric. Krzanich noted that in June's Top 500 Supercomputing list, Omni-Path was deployed in half of the new 100-Gig systems. Looking forward in the data center and the enterprise, Krzanich said that Intel is ramping up production of its Broadwell E server chips in the second half of the year, and he expects strong demand. While cloud continues to expand, Krzanich emphasized that it's an opportunity for Intel as increasing numbers of systems are needed to both power and connect to the cloud. During the earnings call, Krzanich was specifically asked about competition, to which he responded with an articulate reply. "As far as competition, there's always going to be competition in this market. I expect it. That's okay," Krzanich said. Among the primary competitors though is none other then Intel itself. Krzanich said Intel thinks of itself as competition and has a business model to drive continuous improvement of products that enables Intel to replace its own products with better cost-per-performance models over time. "So we know that even if there was no [outside] competition, the competition is we've got to build a product that's better and drives replacement as well as growth," Krzanich said.

With Apple's computing market share dipping to 7.2% in Q3 2016, you would expect the company to release a new round of iMacs in time for its October event. Unfortunately, for Mac desktop fans, it appears as though the press keynote will be focused on the introduction of new MacBook Pros and MacBook Airs. The biggest updates are likely to be seen with the guts of Apple's iMac range, with Intel's latest Kaby Lake processors now ready for production. The latest AMD Polaris graphics chips should also be on-board for video editing and high-resolution gaming, though recent reports have suggested Apple is working with Nvidia this time around. Other improvements are being chattered about via the rumour mill in the expectedly feverish build up to the new iMac's release, with VR compatibility currently headlining the list of less attention-grabbing features.

Prices are expected to start at £899 ($1,099), as they do today iMac 2016 release date Unless Apple chooses to go big on VR at the next event, the reveal of a new iMac isn't necessarily a dead-cert. In the past, desktop Mac refreshes have been a couple of years apart, so the launch of an updated iMac could end up being delayed until WWDC 2017 in June. Still, there's plenty of new hardware for Apple to pack into its popular all-in-one PC, so it's best to stay optimistic that the Cupertino giant will unveil some other tasty new tech alongside the iPhone 7 at its special September event. Comments by AMD suggest that Apple is lined-up to launch some hardware featuring the latest Polaris graphics chipset in late 2016, but that's as close as we have to a real confirmation of an update to any of Apple's computer range. With the hiatus in improvements to Apple's Mac Pro and Mac mini, it's likely that Apple will want to keep its most popular desktop range regularly refreshed to try and claw back some of that lost market share. iMac 2016 price The existing range of iMacs starts at £899 ($1,099) for the 21.5-inch 1080p model, rising to £1,199 ($1,499) for the 4K model and £1,449 ($1,799) for the 27-inch variant. There's little doubt that Apple will stick to the existing pricing tiers, especially considering IBM's comments on the long-term affordability of Mac usage, which were introduced when the company first launched the 'cheaper' iMac back in June 2014. Will it be Intel's Kaby Lake or AMD Zen for iMac 2016? With the last iMac update, Apple skipped on Intel's Broadwell processors and went straight to the latest Skylake chips for the 2015 iteration. Intel is set to provide the latest Kaby Lake processors for the next range of iMacs, the last in Intel's 14nm processing line before the switch to Cannonlake's 10nm architecture later in 2017. Though it is likely Apple will stick with Intel's processors, there is a possibility that the new AMD Zen processor could make an appearance in the high-end 27-inch models. This very powerful new CPU features 8 cores and 16 threads that would provide users with a huge amount of processing power on tap. Of course, there's still a possibility that Apple could skip the latest array of processors and wait for the Cannonlake series before upgrading its full suite of iMacs, but this would push the launch back to sometime in the second half of next year. iMac 2016: AMD on-board with the VR-enabled future Although Apple's range of desktop PCs hasn't lagged behind rivals in the processing department, the lack of graphical grunt is more of a sore sticking point for some users, especially for those wanting to get their game on without having to switch to Windows. With VR rapidly gaining in popularity both on PC and console, it is likely that Apple will not want its loyal customer base to feel like they're being left behind. It's very realistic, then, to expect that the new range of iMacs will include AMD's Polaris graphics, which was unveiled at the beginning of 2016. Reports from WCCF Tech claim that AMD won the contract to produce two chipsets for Apple back in April, and will appear in "new desktops and notebooks from Apple, which the company plans to bring to market later this year". MacRumors thinks that Polaris 10 and 11 are the most likely fit for Apple's new range of Macs, which are built using 16nm or 14nm production processes – smaller and more power-efficient than AMD's 28nm chipsets found in existing 27-inch iMacs. The switch from Intel Iris Pro 6200 graphics in the 21.5-inch models is also highly probable, as AMD has made great gains in offering highly competitive GPUs at a very reasonable price. All in all, Mac users will be looking for plenty of power to support exciting new VR devices such as the Oculus Rift, which Palmer Luckey already said wasn't an option at present due to the underpowered graphical capabilities of Apple's computers. New flash storage for iMac 2016? While the rumours are that Apple is planning on an increased storage capacity in the iPhone 7, we're also hoping that the company makes a major move to further push flash storage with iMacs. The hybrid Fusion Drive is currently standard in the 27-inch range of iMacs and an £80 (around $105) optional extra for 21.5-inch models, though we're hoping that Apple finally makes it standard across the board with all iMacs. Flash storage capacity of up to 512GB is already available in Apple's MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, which helps them to perform noticeably faster than similarly specified iMacs. Although Apple is unlikely to go down the route of flash-only storage for iMacs, hybrid drives would be a particularly welcome upgrade. A plethora of ports for new iMacs? The last Apple MacBook refresh saw Apple eschew all other ports in favour of USB-C, and while it would be unlikely that Cupertino would reduce the connectivity in its iMacs, it's certainly plausible that the new port could make an appearance. Intel's new Kaby Lake processors offer support for USB 3.1 alongside Thunderbolt 3 and DisplayPort 1.2, which could mean that every single port on the new iMac gets a little boost.

DJIA S&P 500 NASDAQ Markets Today Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Stock Climbs, New Processor Targets Intel Advanced Micro Devices' (AMD) new Zen processor is looking to take market share from competitor Intel (INTC). Rachel Aldrich Aug 18, 2016 12:37 PM EDT NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) were advancing 5.61% to $7.05 early Thursday afternoon after the company unveiled a new microprocessor, Zen, meant to compete with Intel (INTC). During an event Wednesday night in San Francisco, CEO Lisa Su revealed working versions of the chip and said the Zen processor can challenge Intel's fastest processor on the market, VentureBeat reports. The company is focusing on high-performance CPUs and GPUs with the Zen processor. The first products to sport a Zen core will be the Summit Ridge and Naples processors, which Advanced Micro Devices plans to supply for thin laptops, high-powered gaming computers and data center servers, according to VentureBeat. The Summit Ridge processor will be released in the fourth quarter of 2016, while Naples will debut in the first half of 2017.

She showed a demonstration against a top-of-the line Intel processor and said AMD’s new chip was showing similar performance. AMD’s stock has rallied this year as it delivered revenue that’s exceeded analysts’ projections, helped by higher demand for graphics chips and custom chips used in game consoles. To justify those gains, and deliver enough profit to reduce its debt load, AMD needs to now reverse market share losses in personal computers and servers with the new design. AMD’s lost almost all of its stake in the lucrative server market and orders for PC chips with a string of products that were either late to market or failed to perform as well as Intel components. By revenue, AMD had just 2.9 percent of the market for PC processors at the end of the first quarter, according to IDC Corp. It has less than 1 percent in server unit shipments. “There needs to be competition in the data center,” Su said. AMD has already sent samples of the Naples server version of Zen to prospective customers and is aiming to ship it in the second half of 2017. Some PC processors will ship beginning at the end of this year with high volume coming in the first half of next year. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The Aero Compute Board features a quad-core Atom x7-Z8700 64-bit CPU with burst processing at up to 2.4 GHz as well as 4 GB of low-power DDR3-1600 RAM, 16 GB of flash (eMMC) storage and 802.11ac Wi-Fi. It offers a number of I/O expansion options as well as a microSD card slot and an M.2 connector (single-lane PCIe) for an SSD. Intel says the board weighs less than 60 g with a heatsink attached. "Plug-and-play" options include a flight controller with open-source Dronecode PX4 software, Intel RealSense vision technology, the AirMap SDK for airspace services, and LTE communications, Intel said. Intel is also taking reservations for a complete, ready-to-fly Aero drone (unpriced so far) for shipment in the fourth quarter. Also at IDF, Intel announced that the Yuneec Typhoon H platform is now available, for an extra fee, with Intel's RealSense technology for obstacle navigation. The Typhoon H with RealSense sells for $1899.

Blog Intel Foundry Embraces ARM: Start of the End? Peter Clarke, Analog Editor, EE Times Europe 8/18/2016 11:00 AM EDT  1 comments   post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet Intel Custom Foundry agrees to a full support package for ARM intellectual property on the upcoming 10nm FinFET manufacturing process. Intel Custom Foundry has made a statement of intent that it is serious about competing with the likes of TSMC, Samsung and Globalfoundries by agreeing a full support package for ARM intellectual property on the upcoming 10nm FinFET manufacturing process. The deal could also mark the start of the disaggregation of Intel and its eventual splitting up into separate manufacturing service and technology sales constituents, in other words the end of Intel as we have known it. In the short term the deal is an acknowledgement that — at least in mobile — ARM's architecture rules the roost and it is what chip developers insist on for their system chips. Despite billions of dollars spent trying to get into mobile Intel Corp. has concurred and let its foundry manufacturing operation cut a deal. The deal means that ARM's Artisan physical libraries — and as a result POP optimizations of its cores — will be available to third parties on Intel's 10nm FinFET process. Spreadtrum and LG Electronics are already customers of Intel's foundry. Intel has now accepted that although those companies may have tinkered with Atom system-chips to please Intel, their commercial architectural choice was ARM and Intel's foundry had to get with the program or risk losing customers. The adoption of Artisan and POP is vital if Intel is to build its foundry customer base because the flexibility this engenders speeds the design of core implementations and SoCs, reduces time to tape-out and thereby reduces risk. It is part of the standard design flow set by ARM with foundries such as TSMC. The initial POP IP on Intel's 10nm FinFET process will be for two yet-to-be-announced Cortex-A processor cores designed for mobile computing applications in either big-little or stand-alone configurations. Of course Intel's foundry has already been making ARM-based chips for the likes of Netronome and may soon do so for Altera, which of course is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Intel's. However, these were essentially arms-length legacy engagements. What the latest agreement indicates is that Intel acknowledges it must engage with ARM if it is to be credible as a foundry manufacturer, even at the risk that it will undermine the position of its own processor architectures.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Intel announces next-gen Knights Mill Xeon Phi accelerator by Bruno Ferreira  10:29 AM on August 18, 2016 You may all be wondering what's up with the Internet's coverage of IDF, since there wasn't a lot of news coming from that front yesterday. And yet, all of a sudden, something big comes along. The item in question is called Knights Mill, a codename for the next generation of Intel's HPC-oriented Xeon Phi processors. Our own Jeff Kampman has his boots on the ground as we speak, and he took a snapshot of Intel's announcement during a session: Personally most excited about the next gen of Xeon Phi #IDF16 pic.twitter.com/FtopKpwEab — Jeff Kampman (@jkampman_tr) August 17, 2016 Put simply, Knights Mill is an upgraded version of the current-generation Knighs Landing CPUs. For those to whom either "Xeon Phi" or the whole "Knights" naming doesn't really ring a bell: these CPUs differ from the more "normal" models by offering many dozens of small cores instead of a few "big" ones. They're targeted at HPC and machine learning tasks. One perusal through Intel's ARK is all you need: the current-generation models pack somewhere from 64 to 72 cores and many more threads. Intel says the Knights Mill models should offer better efficiency when compared to their predecessors, as well as "enhanced variable precision," which we take to mean improved floating-point support. Like current chips, Knights Mill CPUs will have a slice of RAM directly stacked on top of CPU (current Xeon Phis pack 16GB.) The company hopes the new CPUs to be gracing enormous clusters worldwide come 2017. Since we're on the topic of Knight's Mill, it's interesting to look back at how the perceived-as-failed Larrabee went from being advertised as a graphics card to actually power the "Knights" series of Xeon Phi CPUs. In a personal blog entry, Larrabee architect Tom Forsyth lays out a bit of history on the chip and goes on to detail what it was meant to be, what it wasn't, and the public perception of the whole thing. If the fact that "Larrabee = Xeon Phi" comes as an overlooked and surprising fact (including to a good portion of the TR staff), by all means, go read Mr. Forsyth's account.

Dela Cruz, UniversityHerald Reporter 'USB-C vs Lightning’ Connector: Sorry Intel, Apple Will Not Utilized USB-C; They’re going Wireless for iPhones SAN FRANCISCO - JANUARY 15: The iPod touch is on display at the the Moscone Center at the 2008 Macworld Conference and Expo January 15, 2007 in San Francisco, California. The annual conference and expo by Apple runs through January 18. (Photo : David Paul Morris/Getty Images) It's time to say goodbye to 3.5 millimeter headphone jack as Intel is serious in pushing through the USB Type-C to replace the old audio jack. However, it seems like Apple will not yet to the trend and continues to use the proprietary lightning connector to their new iPhone models instead of the USB Type-C port. Apple preferred lightning connector over USB-C for iPhones Apple has completely ditches the idea of USB-C port for iPhones and preferred lightning connector instead. Though it's worth mentioning that Apple adopted the said port for their 12-inch MacBook laptop, this time the tech giant utilized the proprietary connector according to Mac Rumors. Apple is already known for utilizing its own connectors between 2003 and 2012 for iPhone, iPod and iPad. The most noteworthy was the MagSafe connector used in laptops models beyond the 12-inch MacBook. Intel pushes for USB-C Port Intel is pushing USB-C Port as replacement for the traditional 3.5 millimeter audio jack. According to Apple Insider, Intel is impressed with the features of the port include better sound, power management and thinness.  The chip-maker company dubbed USB-C as the best option for accessory makers. USB-C Port vs Lightning Connector First and foremost, the obvious reason why Apple chose lightning over USB-C port is it proprietary and they have full control of it. To be able to know the advantage and disadvantage of the two ports with each other, a comparison of the two was made by Dave Haynie a forum commenter of the website Quora. According to Haynie, USB-C port scored high when it comes to durability due to its ability to handle more signals than lightning connector. Another advantage of USB-C is its visibility in the years to come. Being the new standard port soon, people can always replace an old cable when damaged than replacing the phone when the lightning connector wears off.  Tags USB C vs Lightning, USB Type-C, Apple Lightning Connector, apple latest news, MacBoo Pro released date, iPhone 7 Release Date, USB-C Port © 2016 University Herald, All rights reserved.

Microsoft has acknowledged the problem and is actively working on a patch, but until then you’ll need to follow the steps below if you’re suffering from this freezing problem post-update. Update: Microsoft released a Cumulative Update on August 31, which is supposed to fix freezing in Windows 10; the update is rolled out automatically. If you’re still experience the issue, first make sure update KB3176938 was installed. This update brings your Windows build number to 14393.105. To check your build number, press Windows key + Q, type winver, and hit Enter. If this update was installed, but didn’t fix the freezes, go ahead and try the alternative solutions below. What Causes the Freezing? This particular freezing problem is caused by the recent Anniversary Update, which added a number of new features to Windows 10. 9 Windows 10 Anniversary Update Features You'll Love 9 Windows 10 Anniversary Update Features You'll Love Are you still on the fence about the Windows 10 Anniversary Update?

Boot into Safe Mode You’ll need to boot your system into Safe Mode to perform the steps below, otherwise your system is probably just going to freeze! To do this, first restart your system. When on the sign in screen, hold Shift and select Power > Restart. When your system restarts to the Choose an option screen, select Troubleshoot > Advanced options > Startup Settings > Restart. Once complete, you’ll see a list of choices, so press F4 to choose to boot in Safe Mode. If you need other methods, check out our guide on how to boot into Safe Mode How to Boot Into Windows 10 Safe Mode How to Boot Into Windows 10 Safe Mode Safe Mode is an inbuilt troubleshooting feature that allows you to fix issues at the root, without non-essential applications interfering. You can access Safe Mode in various ways, even if Windows 10 no longer boots. Read More . 1. Change App Install Location Press Windows key + I to open Settings. From here, navigate to System > Storage. Beneath Save locations, use the New apps will save to dropdown to switch it to the same drive that your operating system is installed on. Then click Apply and restart. This isn’t going to work for everyone, partly because you might not be able to fit all that data on a single drive. 2. Disable AppXSvc AppX Deployment Service (AppXSvc) is a service that supports the deployment of Store applications. Disabling this can stop Store applications running correctly, though not necessarily, and that might be preferable to constant freezing anyway. To disable this we need to head into the registry. Press Windows key + R, input regedit and then click OK.

Change the Value data to 4, click OK, then restart your system. Change this back to 3 if you want to enable AppXSvc again. 3. Install Intel Rapid Storage Technology Driver This fix could work for you, you’re using an Intel CPU and one or multiple serial ATA (SATA) or PCIe drives. Intel Rapid Storage Technology is primarily used for creation and management of RAID performance, but it can also be used on single drives. While Windows 10 is able to natively handle this without the support of third-party drivers, some users have reported that installing this Intel driver solved their freezing. To get the driver, navigate to Intel’s driver page and download the latest version. Unzip the file and run the installer within, then follow the steps through. Once the driver has installed you’ll need to restart your system. 4. Uninstall Antivirus Microsoft has reported that having an outdated antivirus installed can cause problems and suggests uninstalling the software and then installing the newer version. Your mileage with this will vary, but it’s worth a shot. Do a system search for uninstall a program and select the relevant result. Select your antivirus from the list and click Uninstall/Change. Follow the wizard through and then restart your system. You can then go ahead and install your antivirus again, downloading the latest version direct from the developer.

Reply David L September 29, 2016 at 10:34 am My PC was freezing if I left it alone for 5 minutes. Once frozen it stayed that way for between 8 and 10 minutes before coming back again. If I kept on using it the freeze did not happen. By a process of elimination I eventually narrowed it down to the task running cleanmgr.exe which waited for the PC to be idle for 5 minutes before commencing. I deleted that task and I have not had a freeze since. Reply dan August 26, 2016 at 5:58 am Is it best to have the OS installed on an SSD and the data on an HDD, or vice versa? Reply Tina Sieber August 30, 2016 at 4:07 pm Your OS and all other frequently used files should be on the SSD for best performance. HDD can be used when read speeds don't matter (e.g. for small, light files). If storage space on your SSD is a limitation, you'll want to store the bulk of your data / backups on a HDD because HDD space is cheaper. Always have a backup! Reply dan August 30, 2016 at 8:33 pm Tina, If the OS gets loaded into RAM after bootup, other than perhaps speeding the boot process why not just store the OS on the HDD instead of taking up expensive real estate on the SSD? Thanks for your reply, Dan Reply Tina Sieber August 30, 2016 at 8:46 pm Good point, Dan! When I was speaking of the OS, I was also thinking of programs and apps. But you made me think... If RAM is big enough to load all system files necessary to run the system, which is probably the case with many setups, then it makes sense to store the OS on the HDD because read/write speed only matters at boot and shutdown and is negligible. For best performance, applications should still be run from the SSD, unless you never use more of them at the same time than can be handled by your RAM. Chrome makes me struggle with that. :) Alternatively, you could outsource the paging file to your SSD. drb August 30, 2016 at 9:07 pm Thanks for your thoughts. Sometimes there are no clear answers. Dan Andrew August 25, 2016 at 1:19 pm PS I meant updates to 1511 since deployment of 1607 Reply Andrew August 25, 2016 at 1:18 pm I had this one with a laptop fitted with a hybrid drive and originally delivered with Win8. . I initiated the upgrade myself so I had backups of everything. It was completely locked after the update I tried booting in safe mode and doing a restore which failed. I then tried doing a reset which also failed. I then did a clean install of 1607 which worked fine. Conclusion: there's something missing in the 1607 update which is present in the full install. I've noticed that Microsoft has still deployed updates since the rollout of 1607 started. Reply mIke August 23, 2016 at 11:23 pm So to put it bluntly, Microsoft don't really know whats causing this but expect their users to debug their problems for them free of charge ! Reply James Van Damme August 23, 2016 at 6:42 pm Boot off Linux flash drive and hit "install". Wait 10 minutes. Enjoy. Reply Skip Spurgeon August 20, 2016 at 12:50 pm Step 2 worked to get my ssd laptop running again. Thank you. When trying to 'roll back to previous version' I could not get to the Update & security > Recovery screen. Now that it is running, I can get to it and have the option to uninstall latest update. Should I do that? Or just wait until MS gets the patch out? All is good right now thanks to you. Reply Joe Keeley August 20, 2016 at 12:55 pm Glad to hear that, Skip. If I was in your shoes and everything else was still running fine, I'd probably wait until the patch instead of rolling back. But rolling back is a fine choice if you'd prefer that! Reply Ankit August 20, 2016 at 4:13 am Thank you! I have the same problem and on an ssd laptop that too! Will try the solutions and/or wait for Microsoft to fix it! Reply Joe Keeley August 20, 2016 at 12:55 pm No problem, Ankit! Let us know how you get on.

The products, also called Silicon Photonics, are basically small form-factor, high speed and low power consumption products for use in data centers. Intel’s Silicon Photonics 100G PSM4 (Parallel Single Mode fiber 4-lane) and Silicon Photonics 100G CWDM4 (Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing 4-lane) are targeted for use in data communications applications for switch-to-switch optical interconnects. Intel and Microsoft claims silicon photonics will be key enabling technology to address networking challenges in the future. The commercialisation and volume deployment of silicon photonics has been anticipated by the data centre industry for years and with the new announcement, most optical networking vendors and operators can aim to integrate optics into silicon CMOS technology. While it won’t be a big deal for an average consumer, the technology does promise high-speed connectivity impossible to achieve through copper wires. Silicon Photonics also consume less power in comparison to copper wire implementation. Intel claims its silicon photonics technology can revolutionise the data center. With Silicon Photonics technology, Intel says it will be possible to move large amounts of information at 100 gigabit-per-second over long distances of up to several kilometers on fiber optic cables. Currently, Intel Silicon Photonics based products are being deployed to connect switches to switches in large data centers and will eventually connect optical network with servers.

SAN FRANCISCO—Power users and enthusiasts who have been hoping for years that processor maker AMD would once again find a way to take on Intel may soon see their wish granted. Today, AMD announced more in-depth information about its upcoming Zen processing platform, a high-end line of chips designed to compete directly with Intel's newest top-of-the-line products. AMD President and CEO Lisa Su (pictured above) claimed in a Wednesday night press pre-briefing at the St. Regis hotel here that the new chips based on the Zen microarchitecture, which uses the company's current 14nm production process, will result in the "most competitive product lineup in a decade" when they are unveiled officially at the Hot Chips 28 symposium in Cupertino next week. But the sneak peek AMD provided, if a bit lacking in technical details, offered some tantalizing tidbits about what users can expect. According to AMD, Zen sports improvements in three major areas: performance, throughput, and efficiency. The Art of Zen In terms of performance, the Zen engine represents what Mark Papermaster, AMD's senior vice president and chief technical officer, called a "quantum leap in core execution capability." This comes from enhanced branch prediction to select the correct instructions, a micro-op cache for efficient op issue, a 1.75-times improvement in the instruction scheduler window and a 1.5-times improvement issue width and execution resources (compared with the previous Excavator microarchitecture), with the resulting instruction-level parallelism designed to deliver "dramatic gains in single-threaded performance." Altogether, per AMD, the Zen core achieves a "40 percent generational improvement in instructions per clock." Several alterations to the cache structure have been specifically aimed at improving bandwidth and reducing latency—each fivefold, per AMD's estimates. These include a "significantly enhanced" prefetcher, 8MB of shared L3 cache, a large unified L2 cache for instructions and data, and separate low-latency L1 instruction and L1 data caches. As for throughput, Papermaster touted Zen's new "simultaneous multithreading" technology, in which a thread appears the same as an independent core to software applications, and the gaps in utilization in high-performance cores can now be exploited for an additional thread. Finally, aggressive clock gating with multilevel regions, a write-back L1 cache, the large micro-op cache, the stack engine, and move elimination contribute to the Zen core's increased power efficiency. The use of the 14nm FinFET design, AMD said, allows for Zen to scale easily from client to enterprise-class products. Zen processors will, as of the Hot Chips launch, be divided into two families. The first, code-named "Summit Ridge," is aimed at the enthusiast market and gamers interested in playing at 4K resolution. At least the top-end Summit Ridge chip will have eight cores (and thus 16 threads), run on the new AM4 platform, and have native support for DDR4 memory, PCI Express 3.0, second-generation USB 3.1, NVMe, and SATA Express. (Like other enthusiast chips from both AMD and Intel, Summit Ridge products will be of the traditional CPU style, without on-board graphics, and not the APU style that includes the graphics.) "Naples" is the second family, of server chips, and will boast at least one part with 32 cores and 64 threads. Performance How will Zen perform? A demonstration showed the new flagship Summit Ridge chip up against Intel's Broadwell-E–based Core i7-6900K, the company's second-most-powerful processor (after the Core i7-6950X Extreme Edition), which also has eight cores and 16 threads. The proving ground was a multithreaded Blender benchmark challenge that Summit Ridge just won. Although AMD representatives remained mum about the clock speed of the Summit Ridge chip, they said that both it and the Skylake processor had been clocked to 3GHz. (The base frequency of the Core i7-6900K is 3.2GHz.) At the press briefing, AMD unveiled several stations at which the new Zen processors could be examined and sampled in their native environments: in a dual-processor (2P) server, in a workstation (loaded with a Radeon Pro video card), as the centerpiece of a VR system, and as the power behind a 4K gaming rig. Without Intel comparison systems on hand, it was difficult to objectively judge the capabilities of the workstation or the gaming computers, though performance on all appeared exemplary. It was clear that AMD, like Intel, takes pride in being able to power VR on the PC side; but by also building the video cards needed to drive it visually, the company provides a complete solution that Intel cannot presently match. //Related Articles AMD Shows Off Full Radeon RX Line at E3 The Future of Zen Despite all that was revealed, there's a lot we still don't know about the Zen processors yet. We've already mentioned exact clock speeds, though in terms of performance it is expected to be "competitive," AMD representatives said, shortly before using the same word to describe the chips' power usage compared with Intel's offerings. No information was provided about the number of different processors available at launch. Nor was price revealed, though it was promised they would be priced higher than AMD's current-generation chips—which, given their much lower performance, is not a surprise. The final details will be released at or before Hot Chips. Su said that Summit Ridge chips could begin shipping by the end of 2016, and that Naples processors will be available in the first quarter of 2017. Zen-based APUs, which will include graphics processors, are likely to be seen in laptops in the second half of 2017, and embedded versions of both the CPU and APU variants will appear eventually as well.

Two new examples of “merged reality” technology have been making waves, but what does it actually mean? By Amelia Tait Follow @@ameliargh         Print HTML This is your future: Windows At least according to Intel and Microsoft, who, at the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco on Tuesday, discussed two new developments. The first is Project Alloy, a wireless headset that allows you to bring real objects into the virtual world using 3D cameras. The second is Windows Holographic Shell, and it does the reverse – allowing virtual computer screens, objects, and people into the real world. Both are examples of merged (or mixed) reality. Nice. Very good. Article over. Except, well, what does that mean? What is mixed/merged reality? In short, mixed reality is when the real and virtual world are merged and objects from both can interact. So, for example, if you were playing a virtual video game, you could pick up your nearby real-life water bottle and hit Dr Eggman over the head with it. Specifically, Intel’s Project Alloy uses mixed reality to allow people to use their real hands in the virtual world. Before this point, users had to hold controllers that represented their hands. Now, the headset’s RealSense cameras will detect your finger movements and allow you to manipulate virtual objects. It is quite an exciting development, but it also looks like this: Experience a whole new virtual world around you - #MergedReality #IDF16 pic.twitter.com/AKFrp9rqA2 — Intel (@intel) August 16, 2016 The headset will also allow you to see your friends in the virtual world, and keep the confines of the virtual world in the real world space around you. In short, this means less walking-into-walls than in a traditional virtual world.  The other development, Windows Holographic, uses the HoloLens headset to let you interact with holographic screens that display things like your emails and calendars. The HoloLens is also one single operating system for virtual reality, mixed reality, and augmented reality.﻿ According to Windows' promotional video, you can also visit the Pantheon. Windows via YouTube How is it different from virtual and augmented reality? Virtual reality is the umbrella term for all these magical artificial worlds that are popping up around us. Most commonly, users plonk on a headset and get a 360° view of an immersive fake world. Naturally, it’s thus far predominantly been used for video games and porn. Project Alloy, a 1st gen #VR solution - imagine merging realities and experience your world differently #IDF16 pic.twitter.com/ZUrKDZ57hT — Intel (@intel) August 16, 2016 Augmented reality – of which the most famous example is Pokemon Go – is when virtual stuff is added to your real world environment. The virtual reality element, ie. Pikachu, is overlayed onto the real world. This has been used for sporting events and tourism, as information about the game or place can be overlayed as you look around. Although this is similar to merged reality, Microsoft and Intel's new projects go further as they do not require sensors and are wireless, so more seemlessly merge the real and virtual worlds.  When is mixed reality coming to destroy life as we know it forever? Windows Holographic was unveiled last year, but the latest announcement revealed that it will be soaring into any Windows 10 user’s life next year. Project Alloy’s consumer release date is set for 2018, and for the time being, there is no word on the price. Although these are big developments, it could take years for the technology to become commonplace. In practice, although it sounds cool, there might not be much demand or it may be considered socially unacceptable (remember Google Glass, anyone?). What will it change about your life? Theoretically in a few years, you could attend a sporting event or concert without leaving your home. Ok, sure, TV has let you do this for a fair few decades, but Intel's CEO Brian Krzanich explains the difference in a Medium post: “Walk onto the field and right into the goalie box, or join the huddle, looking over the quarterback’s shoulder to see the calls before they’re played. Stand on the stage with your favorite band and feel the love of the fans from their point of view. Choose your experience and navigate it. It’s all up to you. The virtual world doesn’t need to be virtual; it can be real.” Krzanich also theorises that you could practise tennis without visiting a court, go on a virtual holiday, and – for some reason, if you were so inclined – play the piano and cello at the same time. Intel's announcement trailer also features a man enjoying a virtual party under the premise: “What if virtual reality felt less virtual and more real?” The idea is that people could come together to party while physically being in different parts of the world, and that you could physically walk around the party without the need for cords and controls. Sounds great, right? Except they then demonstrate that you can pause the party and throw a waiter in a pool. The fact the comment section is disabled says more about this then we ever could: For gamers, mixed reality will also potentially mean a better experience, whereby users can be completely immersed in fictional words by using their own hands and body instead of controllers.  In the world of work, Windows Holographic could let you have meetings with people where you're physically remote but virtually in the same place.  Finally, according to Windows’ video demonstration, you’ll also have a fake puppy. Windows via YouTube No word yet on whether it leaves fake mess to clean up too. › Stop moaning about Europe – Brexit is the least of our troubles Amelia Tait is a technology and digital culture writer at the New Statesman.

Its 1.7 billion users were treated to articles about how the Pope backs Trump and Clinton is dying. It's time to accept Facebook is a force in politics.   By Helen Lewis Follow @@helenlewis         Print HTML Did you know that the Pope endorsed Donald Trump? Admittedly, there are many reasons you might have missed this particular piece of information, not least the fact it’s not true. How about Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly being sacked for supporting Hillary Clinton? Also false. Yet during the US election fake news spread so widely that even senior politicians regurgitated its main themes: “Go online and put down ‘Hillary Clinton illness’ and take a look at the videos yourself,” the Trump supporter Rudy Giuliani told Fox News in August. He was referring to a long-standing conspiracy theory that she was concealing a diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease. What drives these online rumour mills? Since the election, a large part of the blame has fallen on Facebook, where the Megyn Kelly rumour trended in August soon after the company sacked its human moderators and replaced them with an algorithm. Simply, fake news exists because it makes money. Between them, Facebook and Google control 64 per cent of the digital advertising market, and it’s possible to make a good living by running a parasitical Facebook page filled with content scraped from other websites. Strongly partisan political content is particularly well suited to this model. As the former Facebook product designer Bobby Goodlatte put it: “Sadly, [Facebook’s]News Feed optimises for engagement. As we’ve learned in this election, bullshit is highly engaging.” Trump (and, to a lesser extent, Bernie Sanders) has many fans who are convinced that the mainstream media are biased and corrupt. And, responding to these voters’ desire to read “what the MSM won’t tell you” – often because it wasn’t true – came a legion of chancers intent on making a quick buck. In one case uncovered by BuzzFeed, 100 pro-Trump pages were being run by teenagers in one town in Macedonia; in another example in the New York Times, a 35-year-old man from St Louis was making $22,000 a month by outsourcing content production to a couple in the Philippines. I chased one source of the Pope news to a website called wtoe5news.com, which sells itself as “Your local news now”. The site itself was a hollow shell. Clicking on the “Weather” tab brought up a video headlined “Jay Pharoah Acts Out a Secret Meeting Between Black Comedians”; under “Community” was Ben Affleck looking sad. The whole site seemed to exist only to surround the Pope story with plausible architecture. Although let’s be realistic: among the 99,000 people who shared it on Facebook, how many clicked through to WTOE5, as opposed to just reading the headline and hitting “Share”? Tucked away on the About page was a disclaimer: “Most articles on wtoe5news.com are satire or pure fantasy.” Facebook is trying to remove hoax and “satire” sites such as this one; recent changes to its news feed have downgraded them in favour of more established outlets. A more difficult case is something like the American Patriot page, which has more than 500,000 followers and has a grey verified tick, certifying that Facebook has “confirmed this is an authentic page for this business or organisation”. The Patriot’s stories skirt the edge of total bollocks, rather than being flat-out lies. “Christmas lights now banned as ‘security’ threat”, says one. “Everyone Noticed One Thing About Hillary’s Clothes During Her Concession Speech”, says another. Facebook would argue that its verification mark is no reflection on the quality of stories, just that they are coming from the organisation named on the page. But it’s hard to see American Patriot as a news organisation in the way that the BBC is. Still, is it Facebook’s place to make editorial judgements like that? Mark Zuckerberg says no; he has always maintained that he runs a platform, not a publisher. And there’s another problem. The sites peddling bullshit on Facebook are disproportionately right-wing. They are a extension of the alternative media – Fox News, talk radio, Breitbart – built by conservatives over two decades to redress what they saw as the liberal bias of the mainstream. If Facebook goes after fake news in a big way, it will disproportionately affect right-wing pages. And if you put that together with a site that is petrified about appearing biased (and has a prominent Trump supporter, ­Peter Thiel, on its board), what happens? A retreat into “objectivity” that actually benefits the right. Some will say: why all this focus on Facebook when the mainstream media also publish misleading articles? The first reason is the site’s sheer size (1.7 billion users) and reach (44 per cent of us get our news there). Admittedly, the rest of the media are also irritated that Facebook is taking digital advertising dollars that might have replaced their own falling print revenues. They wouldn’t mind it being taken down a peg or two. On Facebook, there is also far less visibility and accountability. When the Sun and the Mail published a false tale about Jeremy Corbyn “dancing a jig” on Remembrance Sunday, they were forced to remove the stories after an outcry. Crucially, enough people saw the fake news, and knew whom to complain to, for it to be taken down. That process is much harder on the sprawling, decentralised world of social networks. Facebook is also where politics happens now. It is vital for fundraising – the Trump campaign said it was their single most important source of donations – and its built-in tools for advertisers allow endless A/B testing of messages to find the perfect one that resonates with voters. For those who wondered where Trump’s “ground game” was – his Get Out the Vote operation – there’s a simple answer: Facebook. As for the Pope, two days before the election, he warned about fear, intolerance and “physical or social walls”. So probably not a huge Trump supporter, then.

Intel has plenty of manufacturing capacity, with one leading-edge factory sitting idle in Arizona even as it wraps up construction on the second phase of its D1X factory in Hillsboro. Intel will make the new chips for LG Electronics. The new manufacturing customer could help fill those factories while giving Intel a back door into the market for mobile chips, a segment of the industry where it remains essentially shut out. Intel declared three years ago it was open to making chips based on designs from rival ARM but it found no takers until now. When Intel announced its strategic overhaul last spring it didn’t even mention contract manufacturing — known in the chip industry as foundry work — and the future of its foundry business appeared in doubt. At this week’s Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco, though, Intel announced it will make mobile chips for LG using ARM-based designs. ARM’s customizable chips dominate the market for smartphone and tablet processors, a sector where Intel remains essentially shut out. Intel will use its latest, 10-nanometer manufacturing process for LG’s chips. Intel hopes its advanced production technology will help it lure more foundry customers. The chipmaker may also hope that it could eventually package some ARM-based chips with Intel’s own wireless technology. That could open the way for Intel to make complete sets of chips for mobile device makers, even if the underlying microprocessors aren’t based on Intel technology. Also Tuesday, Intel announced it will not use extreme ultraviolet lithography technology in the 10-nanometer generation of its chips and said the technology is not ready for the forthcoming 7-nanometer chips. Chip manufacturers have been waiting for new lithography techniques for years, and the absence of EUV has slowed the advance of microprocessor technology. “I can’t say whether it’s a year from now or three years from now,” said Mark Bohr, director of a group overseeing Intel’s manufacturing advances, according to Bloomberg. “I am hopeful.” Intel also announced a new, wireless virtual reality headset called “Project Alloy.” Virtual reality is a hot market in technology and one that places extreme demands on computers.

According to Nvidia, Intel has used old benchmarking software and hardware to paint Xeon Phi in a more competitive light against Nvidia's compute hardware. On a slide presented at ISC 2016, Intel claims that their Xeon Phi hardware is up to 2.3x faster at neural network training than a competing Nvidia GPU. Xeon Phi is also allegedly up to 38% better at scaling, according to the data and comparisons that Intel used on the above slide. Nvidia has disputed both of these claims in a recent blog post. Intel has apparently manipulated these benchmarks by using an out-of-date version of the benchmarking software Caffe AlexNet, the latest versions of which give Nvidia a 30 percent training performance advantage over Intel. Nvidia also says that Intel compared Xeon Phi to older Maxwell-based products; had they compared to modern Pascal parts, Nvidia would have a 90 percent advantage. The scalability claim is also disputed by Nvidia, with the company saying that Intel compared 32 Xeon Phi servers to 32 servers using Nvidia's four-year-old Kepler-based Tesla K20X hardware. Had Intel used Maxwell cards, which aren't even using the latest architecture, workloads would have scaled in a near-linear fashion up to 128 GPUs. Naturally Nvidia believes that GPUs are a better solution for deep learning workloads, however Intel disagrees, and has defended their benchmarking in a statement to Ars Technica: It is completely understandable that Nvidia is concerned about Intel in this space. Intel routinely publishes performance claims based on publicly available solutions at the time, and we stand by our data.

With Android devices such as the Moto Z already having abandoned the audio port, people are angry at companies trying to phase out the old standard - but Intel says its removal could be a good thing. Back in April, the chipmaker spoke about how it wants to replace the 3.5mm jack with USB Type-C. And at the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco earlier this week, Intel architects Brad Saunders and Rahman Ismail discussed the upcoming new USB-C audio standard, reports CNET. Sanders said that one of the main benefits of removing the jack is the space it will free up inside phones, allowing them to become slimmer. Additionally, the analog circuitry it uses can interfere with other electronics inside a device. The use of digital audio could allow sound-processing options usually only available with expensive headphones, such as noise canceling, “concert hall” reverb, and bass boosting. "All of those come into play if audio is in a digital domain," Saunders said. The effect replacing the 3.5mm jack will have on battery life has been a concern. But the revised specifications for USB-C support power management capabilities that allow it to disable features that aren’t in use, such as the microphone; this means "the difference in battery life is negligible." The updated spec will also be able to handle video. Ismail said that while it’s not an HDMI replacement and won’t be suitable for gaming, "it's good enough to do productivity work or watch movies.” As it supports multiple connections, you can use a USB hub to plug several devices into a single USB-C port, and the updated standard includes device authentication to improve security. The combination of features “will really make USB Type-C the right connector for audio,” said Saunders.

According to Intel's data and comparisons, the Xeon Phi is also 38% better at scaling. Well, NVIDIA isn't happy and it's ready to fight, taking to a new blog post saying "We'd like to address these claims and correct some misperceptions that may arise".     First off, NVIDIA claims that Intel used Caffe AlexNet data that is 18 months old, with four Xeon Phi servers against four Maxwell-based GPUs. The latest version which is publicly available, and NVIDIA providing a link to it in their blog, sees NVIDIA's four Maxwell GPUs delivering 30% faster training time than the four Xeon Phi servers. Using four of the new Pascal-based Titan X GPUs, training is a whopping 90% faster than four of Intel's Xeon Phi servers, and if you want to put the boot heel on Intel's neck, just a single DGX-1 machine from NVIDIA is 5x faster than four Xeon Phi servers.   NVIDIA goes into great detail on its blog so be sure to check it out, with the post finishing with NVIDIA saying "It's great that Intel is now working on deep learning. This is the most important computing revolution with the era of AI upon us and deep learning is too big to ignore. But they should get their facts straight".

Zen is a big deal, or rather needs to be a big deal, for AMD because its previous Bulldozer microarchitecture was, well, bulldozed by Intel's Core series. Thus, AMD needs Zen to succeed in order to win over computer makers and lure back buyers to its technology. El Reg was among a gaggle of journalists briefed on Wednesday night in San Francisco by AMD's top brass on the state of play with Zen. Amid the rumors and gossip, let's just cut to the quick and reel off what we now definitely know about Zen – well, at least according to its designers. Desktop Zen-based chips will be fabricated by GlobalFoundries and feature 14nm low-power FinFETs. Desktop PC Zen processors, codenamed Summit Ridge and branded AMD FX, will ship in the first quarter of 2017, with perhaps a few appearing on sale at the very end of 2016. In other words, it won't officially become available in 2016 as AMD had once planned. Summit Ridge is an eight-core design, with 16 hardware threads, that sits on AMD's AM4 chipset and motherboard with support for DDR4 RAM and PCIe gen-3 as you'd expect. We were shown a PC powered by a 3GHz eight-core Summit Ridge running alongside a system sporting a comparable 3GHz eight-core Intel Broadwell-E 6900-series Core i7. At the push of a large red button, both machines raced to render on screen a very large 3D model of a Zen processor package in Blender. Whichever CPU finished drawing the scene first would be the winner. It was a dead heat. All right, AMD said its chip finished just ahead of Intel's, but it won by what looked like a fraction of a second. Anyway, the point was: Summit Ridge is able to keep up with high-end Intel desktop offerings from earlier this year, and AMD reckons its CPUs will only get faster as we get closer to launch and beyond. A Zen core is expected to execute 40 per cent more instructions per cycle, on average, than an AMD Excavator core, which was the previous generation. We estimate that performance boost slots Zen somewhere between Intel's Broadwell and Skylake microarchitecture in terms of single-threaded IPC. Zen must be able to match pace with Intel's top-end chips, or surpass them, to avoid falling behind when Summit Ridge eventually ships early next year. Zen has to fend off Chipzilla's 14nm Kaby Lake and 10nm Cannonlake parts that are coming down the line within the next 18 months. AMD doesn't want to talk about exact benchmarks at this moment. Servers For servers, Zen system-on-chip processors, codenamed Naples and likely branded AMD Opteron, will ship in the second quarter of 2017. AMD's closest server customers have been playing with samples of the silicon since the second quarter of this year. Naples chips are expected to appear in dual-socket systems with 32 cores, and 64 hardware threads, per socket. AMD is drumming up software support from Microsoft, Ubuntu-maker Canonical, Red Hat, Suse, VMware, Citrix and others, for this gear. Naples motherboard ... First look at a Zen-powered server (Click to enlarge) Everything else We were also told that Zen CPUs for notebooks will arrive in the second half of next year. Useful information on pricing, speeds and feeds, and the combinations of cores and clock frequencies and other product configurations, are all being withheld for now, although we should get a closer look at Zen's technical details at Hot Chips 2016 in Cupertino, California, next week. The microarchitecture is supposed to scale across all systems, from embedded products to PCs and notebooks to games consoles and servers. AMD CEO Lisa Su said Zen marked her company's "reentry into the data center." It is clear that AMD has hit the reset button, and is ploughing through with x86 and a one-size-fits-all microarchitecture, allowing it to span as many markets as it can with its relatively limited resources. There doesn't appear to be a lot of room for the ARM architecture in AMD's immediate plans. The biz finally started shipping its 64-bit ARMv8-based Opteron A1100, aka Seattle, server processor at the turn of the year, but, really, AMD is focused on x86 at the moment – from the desktop to the data center. From conversations with AMD staffers, the strategy is: make Zen a success, then worry about things like Seattle. Simply put, AMD wants back into desktops and servers right now, like right now, and x86 will do that for it, not the ARM architecture, which is still feeling its way beyond mobile and embedded. "The software's all there, but the ARM ecosystem has to step up if it wants ARM servers to take off," one AMD executive said. Inside Zen AMD's CTO Mark Papermaster gave an overview of the microarchitecture, including some new bits and pieces. One thing to grasp, if you didn't already know or hadn't realized, is that Zen is a simultaneous multithreading (SMT) design with two proper hardware threads per core, not like the slightly weird cluster approach used in Bulldozer that tripped up performance for some users. Using SMT increases the size of the die, which brings in a few new headaches for the design engineers, but at least you get better multithreaded and floating-point performance. "We’ve improved our floating point unit," Papermaster added. "We're very happy with Zen's floating-point performance: it was a targeted optimization." Zen has 8MB of shared L3 cache, a unified 512KB L2 cache per core, and a 64KB instruction cache and 32KB data cache per core. Here's how the caches fit into the overall structure. Zen also sports a wider instruction window than previous generations, allowing it to execute more code out of order at any one time, thus further optimizing the order of instructions to maximize throughput. We're told Zen has a much improved branch predictor over previous generations, and there's a cache for micro-operations – which are, simply put, the individual steps taken to perform instructions. When an instruction is executed, it's broken into micro-ops that are fetched from the CPU's microcode; Zen caches these micro-op lookups to boost efficiency. AMD has also put some effort into not just gobbling up vast amounts of power: there are mechanisms in place to switch off chunks of the chip that are not in use, thus minimizing current drawn and leaked by the processor. Loads of chips these days have gated powered like this; AMD's particularly proud of its implementation. There's no numbers yet for the packages' power consumption, although they are described as having "competitive TDP." Next week we'll carry coverage of Hot Chips in which we'll shine more light on the Zen blueprints. So far, all we really know is that AMD is still committed to the microarchitecture. Until product specs, prices and independent benchmarks land, no one can get too excited. Tech industry analyst Patrick Moorhead, of Moor Insights and Strategy, told us he was feeling upbeat about what he has seen and heard so far, however. "What AMD showed on Zen last night was very compelling on performance," he said. "AMD said that power would be competitive, the frequency we saw would be even higher at production than what we saw, and production of what we saw could be produced at scale. "All of this sounds incredibly positive. There's a lot of execution between now and launch, but at a minimum, I believe AMD will be in a much better position than they have been in years in processors. To put this in perspective, this is the biggest thing I've seen in ten years in CPUs at AMD." ® Sponsored: The state of mobile security maturity Tips and corrections 78 Comments More from The Register AMD is a rounding error on Intel's spreadsheet and that sucks for us all Zen biz's only hope is to avoid Chipzilla's wrath, it seems 52 Comments AMD accuses Intel of VW-like results fudging Revives ancient SYSmark dispute 39 Comments Latest Intel, AMD chips will only run Windows 10 ... and Linux, BSD, OS X Water cooler El Reg answers your questions while you wait for make all to finish 156 Comments AMD will sell server CPUs at Happy Meal prices so you can supersize servers ARM vs. x86 can wait as first decent Xeon alternatives in ages pressure Chipzilla 26 Comments EU legal eagle: Euro court should review Intel's €1.6bn fine Chipzilla market share WAS overstated, claims Advocate General 6 Comments Server makers love Intel Xeons (true) - but not the price tag Enough to make room for AMD and ARM rivals in 2016? 12 Comments Whitepapers OpenStack brings agility to cloud platforms FICO needed an agile platform to provide its analytic cloud services to mid-sized businesses.

Intel has tried their hand at trying to get in on the market, but it’s safe to say that they haven’t really had much success, at least not on the same level that they have had with their computer chips, but all of that could change soon. Intel has always offered its foundry services to help build chips for their customers, but only if they are based on Intel’s own architecture. However that has changed recently when Intel announced that they will now be building chips based on the ARM architecture which is used by the likes of Apple, Samsung, Qualcomm, and so on, and based on this, it has been suggested by analysts that Intel could very well provide chips for Apple’s iOS devices in the future. According to Counterpoint Research director Neil Shah, “Apple likes diversification in case there is a supply issue. Apple can also use it as leverage to bargain Intel chip pricing for its Macs and so forth.” Right now TSMC is making Apple’s A-series chipsets, such as the A10 for this year’s iPhone, although we have also heard that they will be working on the A11 for 2017, so if and when Intel does get around to manufacturing the chipsets for Apple, it won’t be anytime soon. However the report from Fortune notes that because ARM has licensed limited capabilities to Intel, highly customized chipsets like the A-series from Apple might not be one of them. In any case take it with a grain of salt for now, but who knows what the future holds? Filed in Apple >Cellphones. Read more about Intel, iPhone and SoC.

The new details are on the clock speeds and TDP, with the 16-threaded Zen CPU clocking in at 2.8Ghz base frequency and up to 3.2GHz boost. The new 16-thread CPU will be a 95W part according to the leaks.     If we compare it to Intel's Broadwell-E based, 16-threaded Core i7-6900K processor, which is also made on the 14nm process, Intel has a higher 130W TDP. AMD's 8-core/16-thread Zen-based CPU has a TDP of just 95W in comparison, 35W less than Intel's offering with the 6900K. AMD has some great efficiency tricks up its sleeve with Zen, but the 14nm process used by Intel is different to the 14nm FinFET process that Samsung and Globalfoundries use for AMD's new CPUs.   Performance wise, we already expect over 40% more instructions per cycle (IPC) over the previous generation CPU architecture from AMD, codenamed Excavator. The older FX-8350 from AMD was an 8-threaded CPU (4 physical CPU cores) codenamed Orochi, while the Zen-based Summit Ridge CPU is twice as fast in Cinebench 15, according to AMD. If we're looking at twice the efficiency per core, the new 4- and 8-core processors are going to be rather large improvements for AMD, putting them on a more level playing field against Intel.   CPU architect Jim Keller laid the ground work out on the Zen architecture for AMD before he left for Tesla, and with the exciting news of Zen's purported performance improvements, you have to remember Keller is responsible for AMD's previous ass-kickers; Athlon XP and Athlon 64.

The deal could also mark the start of the disaggregation of Intel and its eventual splitting up into separate manufacturing service and technology sales constituents, in other words the end of Intel as we have known it. In the short term the deal is an acknowledgement that – at least in mobile – ARM's architecture rules the roost and it is what chip developers insist on for their system chips. Despite billions of dollars spent trying to get into mobile Intel Corp. has concurred and let its foundry manufacturing operation cut a deal. Click here to read more ...

Users may remember the Broxton name from the cancelled family of smartphone SoCs several months ago, but the core design and SoC integration is still mightily relevant for IoT and mini-PCs, as well as being at the heart of Intel’s new IoT platform based on Joule which was announced at IDF this week as well. Broxton in the form that was described to us will follow the previous Braswell platform in the sense that it runs in a quad-core configuration (for most SKUs) consisting of two sets of dual cores sharing a common L3 cache, but will be paired with Intel’s Gen9 graphics. The GPU configuration will be either in a 12 execution unit (EU) or 18 EU format, suggesting that the core will have a single graphics slice and will implement Intel’s binning strategy to determine which EUs are used on each sub-slice. It was listed that Broxton will support VP9 encode and decode, as well as H.264. HEVC will be decode but they were hazy in clarifying decode support, saying that ‘currently we have a hybrid situation but this will change in the future’.  There will also be OpenCV libraries available for Computer Vision type workloads to take advantage of optimized libraries that focus specifically on the graphics architecture. It’s worth noting that on this next slide it notes the memory controller supporting DDR3L and LPDDR4, and later on in the presentation it only stated DDR3L. We asked about this, and were told that LPDDR4 was in the initial design specification, but may or may not be in a final product (or only in certain SKUs). However, DDR3L is guaranteed. It was confirmed that Broxton is to be produced on Intel’s 14nm process, featuring a Gen9 GPU with 4K encode and decode support for HEVC (though not if this is hardware accelerated or hybrid or not). The graphics part will feature an upgraded image processing unit, which will be different to other Gen9 implementations, and we will see the return of extended temperature processors (-40C to 110C) for embedded applications. One of the big plus points for Broxton will be the support of dual channel ECC memory. This opens up a few more markets where ECC is a fundamental requirement to the operation. The slides also state a 50-80% higher memory bandwidth over Braswell, which is an interesting statement if the platform does not support LPDDR4 (or it’s a statement limited to the specific SKUs where LPDDR4 is supported). All the displays from the Broxton SoC will support 4K60 outputs on eDP and DP/HDMI, along with more USB ports and support for eMMC 5.0. The support for 4K on HDMI might suggest full HDMI 2.0 support, however it is not clear if this is 4:2:0 chroma support or higher. The Broxton SKUs in this presentation were described as having a 6-12W TDP, with support on a number of Linux flavors, Android, and Windows 10. We asked about Windows 7 support, and we were told that while Broxton will likely support it, given the limited timeframe it is not expected to be promoted as a feature. We asked other questions on frequency, and were told to expect quad-core parts perhaps around 1.8-2.6 GHz. This would be in line with what we expect – a small bump over Braswell.  We are still waiting on more detailed information regarding Goldmont and Goldmont-based SoCs like Broxton, and will likely have to wait until they enter the market before the full ecosystem of products is announced.  Tweet PRINT THIS ARTICLE Post Your Comment Please log in or sign up to comment.

Reply Cygni - Thursday, August 18, 2016 - link The question would be: why? Unless you are talking about Core coming to a mobile device, there really isn't much/any use case for an Atom core grafted onto a desktop or laptop CPU. Reply satai - Thursday, August 18, 2016 - link - a way to get more multithread power into laptop/tablet space? - a way to get the lowest power possible when the load is small in laptop/tablet space? - a way to get more multithread power in highend/pro for some kinds of load? Reply Samus - Friday, August 19, 2016 - link Why? Because it's a really good idea. A quick tweak of the scheduler and a branch monitor would properly thread weak and strong cores on the fly. Colinisation is on to something I suspect we will see within the next few years from Intel. Reply ianmills - Friday, August 19, 2016 - link Intel Atore! Reply jospoortvliet - Sunday, August 21, 2016 - link I already don't see how this SOC is at all relevant in the IoT market, with a TDP of 6-12 watt - while IoT devices are in the miliwatt range. Throwing in the Core architecture would make it even further from relevant. I am not saying this is a nice SOC for some embedded usage like in tv's or cars perhaps but you won't be wearing it and it is overkill for your fridge... so not an IoT this. I guess Intel just uses the term for marketing purposes and it is sad Anandtech.com doesn't call them out on it. Reply BlueBlazer - Thursday, August 18, 2016 - link This could be the new best HTPC chip with low power and full hardware video processing. Reply nathanddrews - Thursday, August 18, 2016 - link Two things: 1. Price would have to be around $100. 2. HDR10 (must) and DolbyVision (nice to have) output guaranteed One potential third item: 3. PlayReady 3.0 hardware DRM (SL3000). We'll likely never see 4K Netflix via PC without it. I'm not sure what Amazon and Vudu use for authentication, but it could be something similar. Reply npz - Friday, August 19, 2016 - link It *could* be but is not yet since they mentioned they don't have full h/w support. Actually, no fixed function hardware on any GPU or CPU supports the full spec of either h.264 or h.265 yet. Only recently the Nvidia GPUs support h.265 main10. But, who knows what other limitations there are, like I-frames, P-frames, B-frames, GOP length, etc. And none support high 10, nor main 10 in other chroma/colorspaces, only YUV 4:2:0, and not the professional 4:2:2 or uncompressed 4:4:4 Reply 1 2 3 ▶ PIPELINE STORIES + Submit News MSI Adds Low-Profile GeForce GTX 1050 Ti to Lineup Game Bundles: Get Civilization VI, Doom, Watch_Dogs 2 for Free with AMD, NVIDIA and Samsung Hardware Plextor Launches EX1 USB-C External SSD: Up to 550 MBps, 512 GB and LDPC Best CPUs: Holiday 2016 ADATA Launches the SD700 External SSD: Dust, Water and Shock Resistant (with 3D NAND) MSI Releases the 'VR One': A Backpack PC For VR From $1999 Best SSDs: Holiday 2016 NVIDIA Releases 375.86 WHQL Driver Update Fold Proteins for Charity & Help AnandTech Beat Tom’s Hardware: Starting December 1st Huawei Mate 9 Porsche Design Unboxing and Hands On Benchmarks Best Tablets: Holiday 2016 AMD Releases Radeon Software Crimson Edition 16.11.4 Hotfix TWEETS IanCutress: The new look at @ScanUKOfficial website is bad.

Intel has long offered foundry services in which they manufacture chips designed by customers, but that service has so far been limited to chips based on its own architecture. As of this week, however, the company has announced that it will also be able to produce ARM-based chips. This would allow Intel to compete with TSMC and Samsung for Apple’s iPhone and iPad chip business … Apple licenses ARM architecture to design its own A-series chips for iPhones and iPads. It has historically commissioned TSMC and Samsung to make these chips, though increasingly moving away from Samsung: TSMC is reported to be the only manufacturer of processors for the iPhone 7, and perhaps also for the iPhone 8. Intel coming on board as an ARM chipmaker creates two very good reasons for Apple to consider it as a future supplier. First, Apple generally likes to have a diverse supply-chain, to avoid becoming dependent on a single supplier. Second, commissioning both Mac and iOS device chips from Intel would give Apple additional bargaining power for both product lines. “Apple likes diversification in case there is a supply issue,” Counterpoint Research director Neil Shah says, noting that Tim Cook is known as a supply chain guru. “Apple can also use it as leverage to bargain Intel chip pricing for its Macs and so forth.” Other analysts agree that Intel will be targeting Apple’s A-series chip business, though noting that it would have to work hard on pricing to be competitive – Apple is renowned for driving hard bargains with suppliers. “We believe these updates were modest positives and estimate the key customer win that could really move the needle would be a foundry win at Apple,” UBS analyst Stephen Chin wrote on Wednesday. “Another uncertainty is how aggressive could Intel be with its foundry pricing to win new customers.” Fortune notes that there are other question-marks also. ARM has licensed limited capabilities to Intel, so highly-customized designs such as Apple’s may not be included. Also, Intel expects to start making 10 nm scale chips next year, but it has already had scheduling setbacks and its latest high-end PC chip family, known as Kaby Lake, is being made at the older 14 nm scale. Given the lead-times involved in such contracts, it is not expected that Intel would be in a position to produce A-series chips any earlier than 2019. In the meantime, it’s been reported that there will be one Intel chip inside the iPhone 7: the LTE modem.

The chipmaker also announced a new member of its Xeon Phi family of high-performance computing (HPC) chips, to be known as Knights Mill. The second day of the Intel Developer Forum (IDF) in San Francisco kicked off with a greater focus on the datacentre, traditionally one of Intel’s key markets. Diane Bryant, executive vice-president for Intel’s Data Center Group, said: “We are currently going through a period of ‘hyper innovation’ that was putting great stress on datacentres and their infrastructure, with emerging applications demanding ever-higher network bandwidth. “Datacentre east-west traffic has been doubling every 12 months. Today, this is handled by fibre-optic connections, but this is expensive. It is estimated that 50% of total network cost in the datacentre is fibre.” Silicon Photonics is intended to solve that problem, said Bryant. It cuts the cost of fibre connections by using Intel’s existing chip lithography technologies to manufacture both the semiconductor laser light source and the transceiver circuitry on a single piece of silicon. The first transceiver modules offer speeds of 100Gbps for switch-to-switch optical interconnects. But Intel has a roadmap to up this to 400Gbps in future, through Silicon Photonics 100G PSM4 (Parallel Single Mode fibre 4-lane) and Silicon Photonics 100G CWDM4 (Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing 4-lane) products. Read more from IDF Augmented reality and building intelligence into IoT endpoints were among the highlights at Intel’s annual conference. Intel is having to face up to a world where simply having faster processors is no longer enough.  One customer planning to deploy the technology is Microsoft, which said it would use it in its Azure datacentres to help cope with the burgeoning bandwidth requirements of its cloud services. “Back in 2009, server bandwidth was a gigabit per second. This year, we’re seeing 15Gbps,” said Kushagra Vaid, general manager for hardware infrastructure in Microsoft’s cloud and enterprise division. According to Vaid, the problem is that, as data rates scale from 10Gbps to 25Gbps and beyond, “we start to hit a brick wall”. Vaid said new technology is required to support continued growth. Bryant also unveiled the next chip in Intel’s Xeon Phi family of HPC processors, codenamed Knights Mills, which is due to arrive in 2017. This follows on from official availability of the Knights Landing chip this June, which features up to 72 processor cores, 16GB of high-speed memory integrated inside the chip package for low latency access, and can be configured with up to 384GB of main memory. Few details Intel disclosed few details about the forthcoming chip. It will be able to run as a standalone processor in its own right, rather than a co-processor, and will include new optimisations for boosting applications such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, according to the firm. “We have included new instructions into the Intel instruction set for variable-precision floating point, offering even higher precision and improved efficiency,” said Bryant. The company expects that by 2020, there will be more servers running data analytics than any other workload. These data analytics applications would be able to take advantage of the new variable-precision floating point instructions. One firm that is already using Xeon Phi to accelerate analytics workloads is Baidu, the web services firm styled as China’s answer to Google. It is using the technology to improve speech recognition algorithms. Baidu said it was planning to build and operate public cloud services based around Xeon Phi, to make HPC facilities accessible to a broader range of developers.

Among the compelling qualities of the Xeon Phi, according to Intel, was its use for Deep Learning, and it was shown in the presentation slides to be a top performer at essential 'training' tasks. I have reproduced the slide I am referring to directly below. The key claims of the slide, and what its graphs try to make immediately clear, is that Xeon Phi outperforms GPUs for deep learning training in three major ways: Xeon Phi is 2.3x faster in training than GPUs Xeon Phi offers 38% better scaling that GPUs across nodes Xeon Phi delivers strong scaling to 128 nodes while GPUs do not It seems that these claims have hit a sore spot with rival chipmaker Nvidia. In a blog post earlier this week the green team was keen to point out that "newcomer" Intel was using out of date benchmarks. Nvidia says that deep learning is such a fast moving field some companies might not be able to keep up with cutting edge developments. A case in point is that Nvidia's own architecture and software "have improved neural network training time by over 10x in a year by moving from Kepler to Maxwell to today’s latest Pascal-based systems". Tables are turned – "Fresh vs Stale Caffe" The main focus of the Nvidia blog post is to highlight that Intel has used old versions (March 2015) of publically available benchmark software and if the newest benchmarks were to be used (with software from August 2016) the results would be overturned – Nvidia would be the winner all the way. A chart below shows how much faster Nvidia GPU solutions are using new Caffe AlexNet data. In another Intel comparison its Xeon Phi is pitted against four-year-old GPUs (Nvidia Tesla K20X) paired with older interconnect technology. Last but not least Nvidia claims that Intel's scaling claims are wrong, as verified by one of its customers, Baidu. Offering some constructive criticism for Intel, Nvidia thinks that "deep learning testing against old Kepler GPUs and outdated software versions are mistakes that are easily fixed in order to keep the industry up to date". Nvidia's blog post concludes that while it is "great that Intel is now working on deep learning," the company should endeavour to "get their facts straight".

Code-named as Knights Mill, the chip is geared towards higher performance deep-learning applications. Intel said the chip would add more so-called “floating point” calculations, which are important for powering machine learning algorithms. The company did not reveal any details about Knights Mill. Intel says its processors already power 97 percent of servers deployed to support machine learning workloads. According to the chipmaker, only 7% of all servers being used for machine learning and only 0.1% are running deep neural nets, a subset of machine learning that emulates the neurons and synapses of the brain to make sense of unstructured data. However, Nvidia has questioned Intel about the performance of its Xeon Phi cards. Intel recently published some benchmarks comparing the ones with Nvidia’s technology, claiming that the Xeon Phi processor is 2.3 times faster than Nvidia GPUs for machine learning algorithms. Nvidia has denied these claims saying that most of the benchmarking came from outdated software and hardware that doesn’t offer a true side-by-side comparison. Nvidia claimed if Intel had used the latest technology, Nvidia would achieve 30% faster training machine learning models over Intel. The company said the Xeon Phi chip would be out sometime in 2017. Earlier this month, Intel acquired machine learning startup Nervana. "Intel unveils Knights Mill Xeon Phi chips for Artificial Intelligence", 5 out of 5 based on 11 ratings.

Nick Knupffer Why Intel's new Kaby Lake processors won't make your computer much faster 0 Laptops by Sean Hollister October 27, 2016 6:03 PM PDT @starfire2258 Up Next Pokemon Go tracking finally goes live and actually works Intel turns to Overwatch to show off seventh-generation core Intel's CEO put his company's new core processor to the test on stage by playing Overwatch. 0:57 Close Drag Apple's new MacBook Pro is an eye-catching new computer. So are Microsoft's new Surface Studio and upgraded Surface Book. But none of them use Intel's latest processors. Is that a big deal? Not as much as you'd think. Here's our explainer from August on what "Kaby Lake" really means for your next PC. Original story published August 17: The clock has stopped. The chips are down. Intel's seventh-gen Core processors, codename Kaby Lake, are now official -- but they aren't as big an upgrade as you'd expect from Intel. Sure, they're a little bit faster and a little bit more power-efficient. But the best thing about Intel new CPUs might actually be this: the deals you'll find on PCs with last year's chips. Here's why Kaby Lake isn't such a big deal. What's a Kaby Lake? Intel's seventh-generation Core processors, the latest and greatest CPUs the company has to offer. They're the successor to Intel's sixth-gen "Skylake" processors from 2015. But Kaby Lake isn't a true successor to Skylake. It's more like Skylake+. Usually, Intel creates a powerful new processor architecture, then the following year shrinks down the circuits for better efficiency. (Intel, much like Ke$ha, is industry-famous for that "Tick-Tock" product cycle.) Enlarge Image Kaby Lake isn't huge. It's about twice the size of California's Lake Tahoe -- a popular vacation spot for Silicon Valley residents. Photo by Google Maps But Kaby Lake doesn't do either of those things. The circuits are the same 14 nanometer size as Intel's earlier Skylake and Broadwell chips, and it's not a new architecture either. Intel had been trying to shrink down to 10nm with a processor called Cannonlake, but those chips were delayed. So for now, we're stuck at Tock. No, really, what's a Kaby Lake? Is "Kaby" a kind of fish? Oh. No, it appears to be an actual lake in Canada. Maybe the CEO enjoys hunting moose in his spare time? Is Kaby Lake any better than my existing computer processor? Intel thinks so! The company says its thin laptop chips are 12 percent faster than Skylake in raw performance, and far more efficient at decoding 4K video. In fact, Intel claims you could get 3 more hours of battery life while streaming YouTube 4K videos (7 vs. 4 hours) compared to last year's chips. And for gamers, the company even showed an incredibly thin laptop playing fast-paced shooter Overwatch reasonably well. That sounds great, no? Sure -- until you take a hard look at how Intel generated those numbers. It's not too surprising that Intel's Kaby Lake CPU ran 12 percent faster than the comparable Skylake -- because the new chip is clocked 12 percent faster anyhow! Which could be a problem, because faster clock speeds tend to generate more heat and consume more battery as well. Enlarge Image Intel shows performance gains of 12 percent. Perhaps it's because the chip is working 12 percent harder? Photo by Intel And while Intel's battery life numbers for 4K video are hard to ignore, Intel tells me that battery life should be "similar" -- not necessarily better than Skylake -- across other kinds of workloads. We could easily be in a situation like Intel's Broadwell vs. Haswell, where the company claimed better performance with the same battery life, but devices actually consumed a bit more battery in real-world use. I'm optimistic, though, and we'll need to test for sure. What about the gaming performance? I wouldn't get too excited just yet. We took a closer look at Overwatch on a Dell XPS 13 with the new Intel chip, and it ran pretty smooth...but with a few caveats. Judge for yourself: Also note that Intel may still have some more powerful graphics in the near future: we haven't yet seen how far the company's souped-up Intel Iris graphics have come. Are there any sleek new laptops or tablets coming with Kaby Lake, at least? Sure! Feast your eyes on the new Acer Swift 7: 9 An early look at the ultra-thin Acer Swift 7 laptop We also saw a sleek HP Spectre with a new OLED panel, a refreshed Dell XPS 13, and a 6.9mm-thick Asus detachable tablet -- the Asus T305 -- with a fingerprint reader built right into the power button. Intel says there'll be over 100 different slim computers with Kaby Lake chips by the end of the year. When will Kaby Lake start showing up in new PCs? Enlarge Image Intel CVP Navin Shenoy holds up a Kaby Lake chip. Photo by Sean Hollister/CNET Well, that's the other thing...we'll see the first Kaby Lake computers in September and October, but only the types of chips that go into thin laptops and tablets. Quad-core laptop chips (like you'd find in a MacBook Pro), laptop chips with Iris graphics, business-class laptop chips with vPro and desktop chips won't appear until early next year. On the plus side, rumor has it you won't need a new motherboard for Kaby Lake desktop chips. They'll allegedly use the same LGA1151 socket as their Skylake predecessors. Will they appear in the new MacBook Pro? Depends on Apple (and Intel), but there's a decent chance they won't. Apple typically uses the most powerful Intel laptop processors available -- the 28-watt ones with better Intel graphics -- and again, Intel says they won't be ready until early next year. That's not nearly enough time to get them ready for Apple's September 7 event. However, Bloomberg reports that Apple won't refresh the Macs until later this year, and it wouldn't be the first time Intel has given chips to Apple ahead of schedule. And if Apple decides to refresh the MacBook Air -- another Bloomberg rumor -- those thinner Intel laptop chips are now ready. Update, October 27: Apple isn't using them. Everything you need to know about the major MacBook Pro upgrade After 4 plus years we'll finally see an all new MacBook Pro laptop. We could see the Apple Watch 2 and an updated first-gen Apple Watch this year. New iPhone 7 details, plus Apple TV is now looking to be a TV Guide. Yikes. by Brian Tong 5:59 Close Drag Should I wait to buy a new PC or Mac until Kaby Lake is available? It definitely couldn't hurt. It's usually better to get the latest and greatest if you can afford it -- and Kaby Lake definitely sounds better if you watch 4K video. But as I've outlined above, most PCs probably won't get a big boost to performance or battery life with Kaby Lake silicon. The real reason to wait: you'll almost certainly find some excellent discounts on Skylake computers once Kaby Lake hits the market. What about AMD's Zen? The Intel rival's new built-from-the-ground-up chips sound promising, but you won't be able to drop one into a desktop till 2017. AMD's new laptop chips will take even longer -- expect them in the second half of next year. How will I tell Kaby Lake apart from previous processors when I'm computer shopping? In one important way, Intel's making it easier than ever before: it'll say "7th gen" right on the familiar Intel sticker you'll find on the palmrest of a new laptop. It's a change we've been asking for. Enlarge Image The new "7th-gen" Intel Core branding scheme. Photo by Intel Unfortunately, Intel also made another change that could prove even more confusing. Ever heard of Core M, Intel's line of ultra-low-power 4.5-watt processors for incredibly thin, fanless PCs? As of now, the company's Core m5 and Core m7 processors are part of the Core i5 and Core i7 family, respectively. That means if you purchase a laptop with a "Core i7" label, it may not offer nearly the same sustained performance as a Core i7 machine from last year. Of course, a thin laptop's Core i7 chip already wasn't as powerful as a thick laptop's Core i7 chip, and neither were as powerful as a Core i7 desktop chip, so perhaps we're just continuing that trend. These days, it's really the size of your PC that indicates its potential performance. Besides, you can still tell the M chips apart if you look at the full model number. If you see a Y (e.g. Core i7-7Y75), it's one of the lower-performance processors. I like specs and codenames. Which processors are actually being announced today? Only six: Intel Core i7-7500U (15W, 2 cores, 4 threads, 2.7GHz base, 3.5GHz turbo) Intel Core i5-7200U (15W, 2 cores, 4 threads, 2.5GHz base, 3.1GHz turbo) Intel Core i3-7100U (15W, 2 cores, 4 threads, 2.4GHz, no turbo) Intel Core i7-7Y75 (4.5W, 2 cores, 4 threads, 1.3GHz base, 3.6GHz turbo) Intel Core i5-7Y54 (4.5W, 2 cores, 4 threads, 1.2GHz base, 3.2GHz turbo) Intel Core m3-7Y30 (4.5W, 2 cores, 4 threads, 1.0GHz base, 2.6GHz turbo) Is Moore's Law dead? How could you possibly suggest such a thing? We're simply waiting for the clock's second hand to remember how to tick.

Featured Story: 10 Virtual Reality Apps to Get You Started with Google Cardboard Virtual Reality News: Bringing the impossible worlds of our imagination to life. — Next Reality News: Windows Holographic Is Coming to Intel's Project Alloy Cord-Cutting Headset Adam Dachis 3 months ago Windows Holographic Is Coming to Intel's Project Alloy Cord-Cutting Headset Most popular virtual reality headsets, like the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift, require a tethered connection to the computer and that imposes some obvious restrictions on how much we can move in our space. We'd all prefer a simpler, untethered option, and Intel wants to provide just that. Don't Miss: Idealens Standalone Headset Makes VR Mobile Without a Phone Utilizing Windows 10 and Windows Holographic as its primary operating environment, Intel's Project Alloy will be one of the first VR headsets to cut the cord: Operate without pesky cords dangling from your VR headset connecting to the computer. The computing power is located in the Alloy Head-Mounted Device (HMD), which allows the user to experience VR untethered. That means you can 'cut the VR cord,' allowing a free range of motion with 6 degrees-of-freedom across a large space. This, combined with collision detection and avoidance, enables the user to utilize physical movement to explore a virtual space. — Intel With falling demand for standard computer processors, Intel's main source of revenue will continue to decline if they don't move into other markets. Virtual reality offers that opportunity, but they need to provide a technological foundation that can compete with existing devices. How Project Alloy intends to do that isn't entirely clear, as the actual hardware could just serve as a reference design. Intel may sell relevant components in the system or the hardware almost entirely pre-built. Project Alloy is a platform paired with Windows, so Intel stands to gain the most by providing third-party manufacturers with a range of options. Intel’s Craig Raymond displays the Project Alloy virtual reality headset during the Day 1 keynote at the 2016 Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco on Tuesday, Aug. 16, 2016. Image via Intel We also don't know much about what the hardware can do, but Intel has expressed that all Project Alloy headsets won't require cables or external sensors. It can function all on its own, interpreting the environment around it using integrated sensors and cameras similar to the HoloLens. With the Idealens already offering a standalone VR option on top of Google's Android, Intel needs to provide something a bit more robust—especially when they don't anticipate any Project Alloy products hitting the market until 2017. Nevertheless, it's exciting to see companies cutting the cord already. Virtual reality tech already offers a wonderfully compelling experience, but you don't want to worry about tripping over cables in the real world when you're immersed in the digital one.

Intel doubles down on Project Alloy as the savior of the PC The jury's still out on whether anyone's going to buy Intel's VR vision, though. Mark Hachman (PC World (US online)) on 17 August, 2016 20:00 0 - - - - print email Your PC is bored. Your smartphone is, too. While you’re reading this story, your digital device is twiddling its thumbs, waiting for you to do something. When a smartphone can offer enough computing power for most tasks without breaking a sweat, you can understand why PC sales are tanking—and why Intel’s so enamored with virtual reality. Intel announced the Project Alloy virtual-reality headset on Tuesday at its Intel Developer Forum, as well as the next-generation Kaby Lake microprocessor. Kaby Lake PCs are scheduled to ship in the fall. Intel executives positioned both announcements in the context of VR: Alloy for consuming VR content, and Kaby Lake for producing it. Intel/IDGNS The Windows 10 Holographic and Intel Project Alloy roadmap. Pinning the PC’s hopes upon VR A few months ago, Intel executives began promoting virtual reality as the leading edge of the PC, especially VR headsets like the Oculus Rift that depend on the PC for their processing power. “Virtual reality is very computationally intensive, and if Intel can create a requirement for more computationally intensive applications, then guess what? That works for them,” said Nathan Brookwood, principal at Insight64, an microprocessor analyst firm. Microsoft/IDGNS Microsoft’s Hololens is demonstrated at the company’s Worldwide Partner Conference in Toronto in July 2016. An update to Windows 10 in mid-2017 will bring Holographic and Windows 10 closer together. Intel expects the worlds of virtual reality—the Oculus Rift—and augmented reality—the HoloLens—will eventually merge. That’s what Intel’s latest project, Project Alloy embodies: a device that primarily projects a virtual reality environment around the user, but incorporates aspects of augmented reality, too. Alloy uses a pair of RealSense cameras to “see” physical objects like a user’s hand, and project them into the virtual space. “We think this is going to be big,” Krzanich said during his IDF keynote Tuesday. “It’s so different than anything else that’s out there right now.” Beginning in the middle of 2017, Intel plans to open-source the Alloy hardware, so any of its traditional hardware partners can jump on the Alloy bandwagon. Alloy runs on Windows Holographic, the Microsoft operating system that powers its HoloLens. Also midway through 2017, Microsoft plans a free upgrade to Windows 10 that will allow Windows Holographic devices to interact with the millions of Windows 10 PCs already in the market. It’s easy to imagine what both Intel and Microsoft hope will happen next: Devices like Project Alloy become the next big thing, selling millions of PCs with Intel microprocessors and Windows 10 licenses. Alloy and its cousins will become PCs you can strap to your face. It almost sounds like Project Alloy could be Intel’s version of the Microsoft Surface—a game-changing product that could lead the way into an entirely new category of products. But it’s still not clear whether Alloy represents a product unto itself, or just a reference design that the company will provide to its partners. Jon Peddie Research For now, Intel is in the “other” category until we better know what Intel’s plans are, Jon Peddie of JPR said in an email. An uncertain future If this all sounds like a desperate attempt to latch on to the latest trend—well, you’re not alone. Unit sales of VR devices aren’t expected to take off until 2018 or so, if that, according to Jon Peddie Research. And it’s not clear what will drive the technology industry until then. In fact, we actually have a better idea of what will drive the technology industry after VR devices: self-driving cars. BMW executives appeared onstage to reveal their plans to ship cars that allow a driver to take his or her eyes of the road by 2020 or 2021. Also on Tuesday (but separate from IDF), Ford announced plans to build fully self-driving cars in the same timeframe. Melissa Riofrio Ford plans to triple its fleet of autonomous research vehicles in 2016, and triple it again in 2017, on its way to mass production of self-driving cars by 2021. As Insight 64’s Brookwood noted, the amount of silicon and intelligence a self-driving car requires vastly outweighs what today’s automobiles require. Products that require sophisticated processors to crunch massive amounts of data provide opportunity to raise Intel’s profile once again. The bottom line, though, is that a self-driving car sells itself. Virtual reality? Merged reality? The jury’s still out. There is hope, though. Kathleen Maher, an analyst with JPR, said the ramifications of virtual reality in the workplace and the home aren’t yet fully understood. “It’s been a big wake-up call for me, that virtual reality replaces the abstractions we’ve been using, like pages and text,” she said. “That’s a really long-term view, but Intel has to be thinking of the long term.” Brand Post Competition: Win a Crucial Ballistix Elite 32GB Kit (4 x 8GB) DDR4-3000 UDIMM valued at $399.95 More from Ballistix Join the Good Gear Guide newsletter!

The three leaders from the automotive, technology and computer vision and machine learning industries are collaborating to bring solutions for highly and fully automated driving into series production by 2021. The future of automated driving promises to change lives and societies for the better. But the path to get to a fully autonomous world is complex and will require end-to-end solutions that integrate intelligence across the network, from door locks to the data center. Transportation providers of the future must harness rapidly evolving technologies, collaborate with totally new partners, and prepare for disruptive opportunities. Together with Intel and Mobileye, the BMW Group will develop the necessary solutions and innovative systems for highly and fully automated driving to bring these technologies into series production by 2021. The BMW iNEXT model will be the foundation for BMW Group’s autonomous driving strategy and set the basis for fleets of fully autonomous vehicles, not only on highways but also in urban environments for the purpose of automated ridesharing solutions. BMW Group, Intel and Mobileye are convinced that automated driving technologies will make travel safer and easier. The goal of the collaboration is to develop future-proofed solutions that enable the drivers to not only take their hands off the steering wheel, but reach the so called “eyes off” (level 3) and ultimately the “mind off” (level 4) level transforming the driver’s in-car time into leisure or work time. This level of autonomy would enable the vehicle, on a technical level, to achieve the final stage of traveling “driver off” (level 5) without a human driver inside. This establishes the opportunity for self-driving fleets by 2021 and lays the foundation for entirely new business models in a connected, mobile world. On July 1, 2016, the three partners were present at the BMW Group Headquarters in Munich to express their commitment to strive for an industry standard and define an open platform for autonomous driving. The common platform will address level 3 to level 5 automated driving and will be made available to multiple car vendors and other industries that could benefit from autonomous machines and deep machine learning. The companies have agreed to a set of deliverables and milestones to deliver fully autonomous cars based on common reference architecture. Near term, the companies will demonstrate an autonomous test drive with a highly automated driving (HAD) prototype. In 2017 the platform will extend to fleets with extended autonomous test drives. “Today marks an important milestone for the automotive industry as we enter a world of new mobility. Together with BMW Group and Intel, Mobileye is laying the groundwork for the technology of future mobility that enables fully autonomous driving to become a reality within the next few years,” said Mobileye Co-Founder, Chairman and CTO Professor Amnon Shashua.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 18 August 2016 | MYT 9:00 AM Intel introduces Project Alloy headset as a bet on virtual reality's future by janko roettgers Virtual push: A filepic of a VR headset. Even though it doesn't actually want to build its own consumer headsets, Intel is throwing its hat in the VR ring because it wants other manufacturers to use its chips, and that's currently far from certain. — AFP Relaxnews LOS ANGELES: Chip giant Intel officially unveiled its very own virtual reality (VR) headset at its developer conference in San Francisco on Aug 16.  However, Project Alloy, as the headset is being called, won't actually compete head-to-head with the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive. Instead, it's meant to be a reference design for other manufacturers – and a long-term bet to keep Intel relevant in the nascent virtual reality space.  Project Alloy is at its core a standalone headset that works without any external computer, and also doesn't require users to plug in their own mobile phones. This sets it apart from both the more expensive Rift-type VR hardware and cheaper mobile VR headsets like Samsung's Gear VR.  In addition to its own computing chips, Alloy also packs a number of camera sensors that make it possible to use one's own hands as controllers. Alloy is also capable of recognising elements of the space around a user, which means that you'll be able to play a game in your living room without inadvertently bumping into your coffee table. Intel has been developing this kind of sensor technology under the RealSense moniker for some time.  However, Intel won't be selling consumers Alloy headsets any time soon. The company is instead looking to open source the Alloy design next year, and allow third parties to build their own headsets based on Intel's reference design.  The company is also collaborating with Microsoft to bring some of its technology to Alloy-based headsets. Earlier this summer, Microsoft announced plans to bring the holographic technology that powers its own HoloLens headset to third-party devices.  So why is Intel throwing its head in the VR ring if it doesn't actually want to build its own consumer headsets? Because it wants other manufacturers to use its chips, and that's currently far from certain.  High-end headsets like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive are already often powered by Intel, since the company's chips are at the core of many gaming PCs. However, mobile VR headsets like Samsung's Gear VR use phones to do the heavy lifting, and mobile has long been a sore spot for Intel, as most phones are powered by ARM chips.  The future of virtual reality is still very much undecided: Will consumers flock to stationary, more capable but also more expensive headsets? Or will they instead embrace cheaper and less-capable mobile headsets? Google is betting on the latter, and introduced a new Android-based VR platform called Daydream earlier this year. The company has alliances with a series of handset makers, and first Daydream-capable phones are expected to launch later this year.  For Intel, that's a worrying trend. If handset makers dictate the future of VR, then it may find itself once again shut out of a massive opportunity.  By introducing Alloy now, Intel essentially signals hardware makers that it is ready to be a part of the future of virtual reality headsets – even if the first Alloy-based headsets won't ship any time soon. — Reuters You May Be Interested Facebook in crosshairs as fake news battle heats up Yew Sin-Ee Yi continue fine run in Hong Kong Pokémon Go: Dittos are hiding in plain sight Fraud in Felda Global Ventures Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Apple issues recall on September, October 2015 iPhone 6S Others Also Read Italian police hope for Christmas reunion between migrant child and mother M’sia, Thailand to begin talks on Bangkok-KL HSR project - Thai Minister Japan enlists Sailor Moon to promote safe sex advertisement Latest News Philippines money laundering body charges bankers for ignoring cyberheist Google nears tax settlement with Indonesian government: sources The new Vivo V5 takes the selfie crown Self-driving car group urges US regulators to clear road Singapore unveils self-driving scooter, ideal for phone-obsessed walkers Most Viewed in Tech Apple issues recall on September, October 2015 iPhone 6S Viral video will crash your iPhone The new Vivo V5 takes the selfie crown Pokémon Go: Dittos are hiding in plain sight Google nears tax settlement with Indonesian government: sources Self-driving car group urges US regulators to clear road Israeli firm can steal phone data in seconds Singapore unveils self-driving scooter, ideal for phone-obsessed walkers Pokémon Go says thanks and reshuffles CP Watch your self-ie!

Hafizah Osman (ARN) 18 August, 2016 11:38 - - - - print email Distributors BMS Technology Dicker Data Impact Systems Technology Ingram Micro Australia Leader Computers Synnex Comments Intel is ramping up its efforts on 5G, outlining three 5G focus areas – the industry partnerships, end-to-end 5G-related hardware and software development (such as Narrow Band IoT), and 5G standards-setting. The company’s next generation and standards organisation 5G business and technology general manager, Rob Topol, said 5G is set to change the way the company operates and how the market responds to connectivity. “We’re very excited about 5G as a company," he said. "We have started research and development on it at a very early stage so that we can build prototypes that demonstrate many different use cases. "5G is going to be something that will be a network change and a wireless change that will be much more than just about smartphones or other mobile devices. "5G will be bringing together the connected requirements with increased needs for compute. As you bring those two together, 5G is going to open up many new use cases, opportunities like automotive or connected homes or industrial automation." According to Topol, in heading down that path, Intel has been working on solutions and early prototypes that demonstrate that. He said it affects the network all the way through to Cloud. “We want to deliver end-to-end requirements on 5G," he added. Intel network platform group wireless access strategy and technology director, Caroline Chan, said Asia-Pacific and Japan poses great opportunity in terms of collaboration in the 5G space.

Going forward, this will be the foundation for the 5G platform,” she said. Topol also said Intel’s goal is not to drive something that’s proprietary but to have a play that spans across multiple technologies and fields. “Our approach is to do this collectively with the channel ecosystem. If you look across the early specifications of taskforces formed, our goal was to be a member of as many of them as possible so we can not only be involved in the early stages of trial but also help drive converged standards.” “Our desire is open-sourced, standard-based product lines That is the best scenario for Intel,” he added. Read more Optus’ operating revenue slips 13 per cent Intel will also be working more collaboratively with spectrum policy and advocacy like governments and operators in the Asia-Pacific region to facilitate the use of 5G. “As we start to lay that groundwork and know what’s best in terms of features that are needed in the marketplace, that’s when we can decide what sort of infrastructure build out to do in these countries,” Topol added.

Two depth-sensing cameras also track elements from the real world -- like your hands -- in VR. by Lexy Savvides 1:12 Close Drag The best virtual reality can be a pain to set up. You need a pricey PC, a fancy headset and great motion controllers, and you'll still be tethered by a cord. But Intel's Project Alloy wants to throw those limitations out the window. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich kicked off his Intel Developer Forum (IDF) on Tuesday with a bold claim: "Merged reality will be one of those fundamental shifts that's going to redefine how we work, how we're entertained, and how we communicate." What's "merged reality," you ask? It seems to be an Intel term to describe a VR experience that uses depth-sensing cameras to bring elements of the real world into a completely cordless VR headset. 27 Inside Project Alloy, Intel's wireless VR headset Project Alloy is the prototype version of that headset, and it already seems to work at a very basic level. In a demo on the IDF stage, the company showed how users could walk around a rudimentary virtual space and interact with objects using their own hands. Enlarge Image Photo by Intel While the presenter struggled a bit, the headset's integrated Intel RealSense cameras let him bend each of his fingers in virtual reality, push a lever, and use a real-world dollar bill to carve a virtual golden statue spinning on a virtual pottery wheel. Rival cordless headsets like Microsoft's HoloLens and the Meta 2 are still struggling to track your hands, so the demo seemed reasonably impressive. Don't get too excited, though. Intel doesn't plan to actually produce a consumer VR headset. As usual, the chipmaker is trying to sell these technologies to partners, and it could be quite a while before they do. Intel says even partners will have to wait for the Project Alloy headset until the second half of 2017. Besides, there's a reason why the best VR headsets still have tethers today: it takes an awful lot of CPU and GPU power to make a virtual world feel real. Intel didn't offer a price or specifically name any partners for Project Alloy. (If you think "Merged Reality" sounds a lot like Microsoft's "Mixed Reality" or Magic Leap's "Cinematic Reality," or even just plain ol' augmented reality, you're not alone. -- read about the differences here -- but Intel CEO also has a whole blog post about what he believes "merged reality" should mean.)

Thursday 18 August 2016  | Comment Now Intel brings real life to virtual worlds, but is it enough to get the company into the VR industry? Intel has unveiled a virtual-reality headset capable of bringing near-field objects into virtual worlds. Dubbed as a “merged reality” device, Intel's Project Alloy sounds like something straight out of a science fiction novel, allowing the wearer to see their hands and other objects in virtual worlds and environments. The question is, who actually wants a VR experience with their hands? Project Alloy works by using Intel's RealSense depth-sensing cameras, the same ones used in Windows 10 laptops and computers for facial recognition systems. These cameras can accurately capture and map a user's hands with the headset and place them into the virtual space. Merging this with a virtual world on the headset's screen, wearers could use their hands to physically interact with their environment. During Project Alloy's unveiling at the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco, Intel's CEO Brian Krzanich claimed the device would, according to the BBC, “redefine what is possible with computing”. From footage shown on-stage, it's clear that Intel's RealSense camera can pick up low-resolution scans of real-life objects to import into a virtual space. It's also evident that objects are only detected when held close to a user's face. Still, as a Medium post by Krzanich points out, the technology does have advantages over the likes of Oculus Rift or HTC Vive, which require users to install and setup sensors to capture a room for positional tracking. Here, Intel's headset does the heavy lifting itself by using depth-sensing cameras to work out your position within a given space. Working out the kinks Interestingly, Project Alloy is like HoloLens in that it's a completely wireless system. This certainly does have its own advantages, such as never becoming tangled in a wire or being “jolted” out of an experience due to the limitations of a cord. However, by processing everything onboard, Intel's Project Alloy certainly can't replicate the silky smooth experience of a proper VR headset running on a high-end PC. If anything, it'll be something akin to Samsung's Gear VR experiences except with more positional tracking data. It's also hard to imagine exactly what something like Project Alloy would feel like,without controllers. Krzanich explains how Intel sees Alloy working by stating you could “pick up your real-world tennis racket in your living room and step virtually onto the court at Wimbledon… fully lean into practicing your back swing – bringing both your hand and racket into the virtual field of play.” While that approach to play may work for Krzanich and his tennis court-sized living room, I'd honestly have to say that I'm a little nervous about swinging a full-sized tennis racket around my house. Video of Intel Introduces Merged Reality Even if you can bring in real-world elements into a virtual world, it's hard to imagine they'd be pleasingly convincing experiences without haptic feedback. Having used many VR devices, the best experiences out there are from ones that provide a sense of feedback to help immerse you inside a virtual space. That said, Microsoft's HoloLens doesn't make use of a controller except in some specific situations and, if Tim Cook's words are to be taken as gospel, Apple's AR project may also not make use of a physical controller.   Intel isn't looking to actually manufacture Project Alloy itself. Instead, it wants to ensure it doesn't miss out on a vital new market like it did with the rise of the smartphone. Intel plans to sell its Alloy technology to manufacturing partners who can use it to develop their own “mixed reality” products. Currently, nobody has been named as working with Intel on the headset, but Microsoft has stated that Windows 10 will soon support Alloy via an update. While it's still not quite clear who Intel is aiming at with Project Alloy, it'll certainly be interesting to see how the chip manufacturer manages to bring its technology into a still-developing market like VR.

In a post on the GE Reports website, the company discussed the relationship: "Intel’s ultimate goal is to utilize Predix on top of its own internal software and develop a joint offering with GE to streamline its fab processes around the world. GE will then roll out the solutions to GE’s more than 400 factories globally. The two companies also plan to sell a joint offering to other manufacturers that want to optimize their operations." The vision for the partnership goes beyond even that to incorporate LED lighting from GE Current and sensors based on Intel chips with early applications seen in GE turbine production facilities and Intel's Santa Clara, Calif., headquarters. The goal is to eventually get every industrial company that uses Intel chips — and most of them do — to connect their operations to Predix and start analyzing their operations in greater detail, says Denzil Samuels, Global Head of Channels, Alliances, Business Development and Ventures, GE Digital. “We want to embed Predix on every single Intel device, so that as they sell those devices, they’re selling Predix, and the customer just has to activate it,” Samuels says.   Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Doug Chandler's blog EMAIL Print Halco Lighting Technologies Acquires J&J Electronics Sonepar to Rebrand Hagemeyer-IDG as Vallen Distribution Discuss this Blog Entry 0 Post new comment Name: * Sign In or register to use your Electrical Marketing ID Email: * Your comment: * Related Articles Philips Lighting and Xiaomi partner on smart lighting for China market Study Finds SPAs Spreading in Market   Plumbing and Tool Buying/Marketing Groups Join IMARK in UCAA Cooperative   BOSS Controls Signs IP Group as Channel Partner to Market Plug-Load Control Solution   Toshiba looking for LED luminaire partners?

Sponsored Watch Your Favorite Christian Films, 24/7. Click Here To Start Your Free Trial Today With rampant rumors circulating that Microsoft is going to launch a new Surface Book 2 along with Surface Pro 5,  fans could no longer wait for it to happen. However, they may have to wait for a few more months as reports are consistent that both laptops will arrive in early 2017. What's even more interesting is that the new Surface Book 2 will carry a different design from its predecessor. Apart from the cosmetic upgrades, the upcoming laptop is also expected to sport advanced specs and features. It has been reported that Microsoft Surface Book 2 will become one of the first devices to run on the upcoming Intel seventh generation core processor, the Kaby Lake. The powerful chipset is expected to support 3D and 4K display, which will eventually become one of the highlights of the Surface Book 2. Another feature that will be supported by the new Intel processor is virtual reality or VR. If rumors prove to be true, Microsoft will certainly build the next Surface Book laptop around Intel's Kaby Lake processor. According to Windows Central, one of the design changes of Microsoft Surface Book 2 is its hinges. According to the publication, the company will close the gap in its hinges to give it a better look compared to the original Surface Book. In a report by the BitBag, the upcoming laptop will carry 16 GB of RAM, which will be paired with its powerful processor. It will also house up to 1 TB of internal storage capacity. Just like the Surface Pro 5, the Surface Book 2 is also rumored to feature a USB Type-C connectors and ThunderBolt 3 ports. Meanwhile, according to CIO, the upcoming machine will be sold between $900 and $1500. However, this information has yet to be confirmed by Microsoft.

This week, AT&T said that it is talking with powerful companies about working together on the technology. Computerworld says that Ericsson, Nokia, Huawei, Qualcomm, Intel, Samsung and LG are among the possible stablemates. Others, including China Mobile, Deutsche Telekom, KDDI, NTT DoCoMo, Telstra and Vodafone, may get in the mix in the future. It is common for big players to band together during a promising new technology’s formative stages, for two main reasons: The short-term goal is to keep progress moving as quickly as possible. In the longer term, such cooperation makes it more likely that the companies’ plans become part of the eventual standard. In what clearly doesn’t constitute a surprise, AT&T competitor Verizon is not one of the companies. Big Growth Ahead for Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality IDC has provided some insight into how it thinks the augmented reality/virtual reality (AR and VR) segment will evolve. The company said this week that it expects spending on the category to hit $500 billion next year. Hardware will account for more than half of the forecast revenues during the period. Software services will grow more than 200 percent this year compared to last. During the middle years of the forecast period, however, IDC says software will be overtaken by services revenue. Globally, IDC believes that VR will outshine AR revenues in 2016 and 2017, but that AR revenues will pass VR after 2017. Broadband Grants to Louisville, Raleigh and Austin Louisville, Kentucky; Raleigh, North Carolina; and Austin, Texas each will receive $30,000 grants to help in their efforts to set up high-speed broadband networks. According to The Louisville Courier-Journal, the non-profit Next Century Cities selected the cities to receive the first Charles Benton Next Generation Engagement Awards. The award is funded by the Democracy Fund and the Benton Foundation. Louisville plans to use the funding to provide gigabit service to a community center in West Louisville, though the precise location has not yet been determined. The grant will be used to establish InVision Raleigh, which the story says will promote “visioning” and planning with the local government. Officials in Austin are developing the Smart Work, Learn and Play program. It is aimed at public housing residents. SDN, NFV Leading to Reduced Capex for AT&T This week, Cisco announced significant workforce reductions. The move was caused by the growth of software-defined networks and network functions virtualization (SDN and NFV). SDNs and NFVs will also have a chilling effect on capital expenditures (capex). This week, AT&T Chief Technology Officer and AT&T Labs’ President Andre Fuetsch said at Nomura’s 2016 Media, Telecom and Internet Conference that the new approaches will cut costs for the carrier in the long run. The idea is that over time, the flexibility that SDN and NFV allow and the ability for systems to run on commodity hardware will mean that less expensive equipment will be needed. Fuetsch’s statement, quoted at WirelessWeek, is a sign that the strategy is working: ’As we deploy more and more virtual functions, and as the hardware that we’re running those virtual functions, as that becomes more commoditized, all those efficiencies we gain back,’ Fuetsch explained. ‘We have the option of turning those investments back into the network or keeping those. So I would say, again, it’s hard to speculate here, but definitely a downward trajectory is what we’re looking at.’ Fuetsch didn’t provide percentages on the capex reduction. Big Data, IoT Pushing M&A Market The catchphrase “follow the money” is especially true when it comes to technology merger and acquisition (M&A) activity. This week, Ernst & Young said that in the second quarter, there were 28 deals of $1 billion or more in value, the most deals of such sort in history. The previous high was 20 deals, which was set in the fourth quarter of last year. The report points to Big Data and the Internet of Things (IoT) as the leaders. IoT deals enjoyed 28 percent and 26 percent increases in total number of billion-dollar deals during the year-over-year and to-date calendar year periods, respectively. Big Data rose 13 percent year over year and 29 percent for the year to date. Carl Weinschenk covers telecom for IT Business Edge.

Dividends have become much more common in the Nasdaq in recent years, but income investors searching for winners there should look beyond yield. Dan Caplinger (TMFGalagan) Aug 19, 2016 at 2:02PM Image source: Getty Images. Historically, the Nasdaq 100 hasn't been well-known as a habitat for dividend stocks. The tech-heavy exchange was full of companies that tended to reinvest their profits into growth projects rather than returning capital to shareholders. But in recent years, more Nasdaq-listed companies have are looking at dividends as a critical part of their total return success. Below, we examine the 10 top-yielding dividend stocks in the Nasdaq 100 today, with an eye toward identifying whether any of them give you the combination of income and growth prospects that make them ideal candidates for your portfolio. The Nasdaq 100's High Yield Winners Here are the 10 highest-yielding stocks among the Nasdaq 100 as of Aug. 18: Company Dividend Yield Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) 8% Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) 5.4% Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) 4.5% Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) 4.4% Viacom (NASDAQ:VIA) (NASDAQ:VIAB) 3.7% Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) 3.4% Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) 3.4% Maxim Integrated Products (NASDAQ:MXIM) 3.2% Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) 3.1% Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) 3% Data source: Yahoo! Finance. The most obvious thing about this chart is the huge lead that Seagate Technology has over its Nasdaq 100 brethren. The maker of hard-disk drives and other data storage products has long been on many investors' danger lists in terms of expectations for a dividend cut in the future, especially because the company has been under considerable pressure as the mobile revolution reduces the importance of PCs, with their traditional reliance on hard drives for storage. In addition, Seagate's free cash flow has been less than its dividend payments in the first two quarters of 2016. Ordinarily, such a high yield would indeed be a danger sign. However, Seagate has actually seen its yield drop from double-digit percentages earlier this year as the stock recovered somewhat from lows below $19 a share, and optimism about the company's prospects are the primary cause. Investors were pleased by Seagate's recent restructuring announcements, and even though the company expects to reduce production of hard drives, it is looking at focusing more on high-end enterprise applications, which carry higher margins. In addition, efforts to expand its exposure to flash memory and solid-state drives could represent growth opportunities for Seagate as well. Rival Western Digital has also seen some positive movement in its share price, and although its yield also remains high, rays of hope have emerged for the data storage industry. Flying lower Another trend you can see in this list of stocks is that it includes many former high-flyers that have come upon tough times. In the semiconductor industry, for instance, Qualcomm and Intel are both going through the pains of adapting to changing conditions in the PC and mobile chip businesses. Cisco has seen similar changes afflict its networking hardware unit. Yet an recently improving tech sector has lifted those stocks and sent their yields lower compared to where they were early in 2016. Among the stocks above, however, there are some interesting growth candidates. Vodafone has struggled due to competitive pressure in the European wireless telecom market, but the decline in the British pound could bolster its profits due to favorable foreign-exchange impacts and help send the stock higher. Moreover, expansion efforts in emerging markets in Africa, the Middle East, and the Asia-Pacific region could also add to growth. Even though Vodafone no longer has its exposure to the U.S. market after selling its minority stake in Verizon Wireless, the British telecom arguably has even better prospects because of the potential in many underserved emerging markets. At the same time, Paychex has exposure to the strong U.S. economy. By offering payroll services to employers, especially small and mid-sized businesses, Paychex keeps its finger on the pulse of American employment trends. As job growth has increased and the economy has recovered from the financial crisis, Paychex has been able to sustaining its own growth. With the U.S. still outpacing its peers overseas economically, Paychex offers not only an attractive yield but also plenty of possibilities for rising share prices. For dividend investors looking at the Nasdaq as a source of stock ideas, the index's traditional aversion to dividends has almost entirely disappeared. By focusing on the stocks with the best growth prospects, however, you'll ensure that you not only get paid while you wait for companies to reach their full potential but also enjoy share-price appreciation when they succeed in their growth goals. Seagate offers that mix for those who are willing to assume the execution risk of the storage-device maker's turnaround efforts, and both Vodafone and Paychex also have opportunities to expand their respective businesses to give dividend investors even more of what they want in the months and years ahead.

The tie-up is the latest between automakers and tech companies hoping to speed driverless cars to market. Here’s a rundown of who’s working with whom: UBER/VOLVO/TOYOTA/OTTO Ride-hailing company Uber Technologies and Volvo Cars signed a $300 million deal for Volvo to provide SUVs to Uber for autonomous vehicle research. The Volvo SUVs will be part of Uber’s self-driving fleet of taxis in Pittsburgh. Both companies will continue to develop autonomous vehicles separately. Uber also is buying Otto, a startup that has developed software that lets big rigs drive autonomously. Earlier this year, Toyota Motor Corp. bought a small stake in Uber for an undisclosed amount. LYFT/GENERAL MOTORS/CRUISE AUTOMATION General Motors Co. invested $500 million in Uber rival Lyft Inc. earlier this year. The companies are developing a fleet of autonomous electric taxis that could be deployed through Lyft within the next year. GM also acquired Cruise Automation, a startup that makes autonomous vehicle software, for $581 million. LYFT/DIDI CHUXING/UBER/APPLE Chinese ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing invested $100 million in Lyft last fall. The partnership allows U.S. customers use the Lyft app to hail Didi rides while in China and vice versa. Uber recently complicated that deal by selling its China business to Didi in exchange for an 18-percent stake in the Chinese company. And there’s another wrinkle: Apple Inc., which is believed to be working on its own autonomous cars, invested $1 billion in Didi in May. GOOGLE/FIAT CHRYSLER Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which has been working on self-driving cars since 2009, is working with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles to build 100 self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivans. The vans will let Google double the size of its autonomous test fleet. VOLKSWAGEN/GETT Volkswagen AG invested $300 million in Uber competitor Gett Inc. in May. Gett said it would provide Volkswagen with the technology to expand beyond car ownership and into ride- and car-sharing. BMW/INTEL/MOBILEYE BMW AG, Intel Corp. and Israel’s Mobileye NV are teaming up to build and commercialize driverless cars. The companies say they could have autonomous vehicles in production by 2021. BMW’s iNext electric sedan will serve as the platform for the technology. Intel makes the computer processors necessary to operate self-driving cars, while Mobileye makes advanced camera systems. The vehicles would likely be used by ride-sharing fleets. FORD/VELODYNE/BAIDU Ford Motor Co. is aiming to have fully self-driving cars — with no steering wheels or pedals — in ride-sharing fleets by 2021. Ford and Chinese search engine company Baidu Inc. — which has also invested in Uber — are investing $150 million in Velodyne, which makes the laser sensors that help guide self-driving cars. Ford also acquired Israel-based SAIPS for its expertise in artificial intelligence and computer vision, and invested in Berkeley, California-based Civil Maps. AUDI/MERCEDES/BMW/HERE Last fall, Nokia Corp. sold its digital mapping business, Here, to a consortium of German automakers for $3 billion. Audi, BMW and Mercedes say precise maps are a key to developing autonomous cars as well as advanced driver assistance features. NISSAN/NASA Under a five-year partnership, researchers from Nissan and NASA are working on autonomous driving systems and human-machine interface projects with software that can be used on both cars and planetary rovers. Nissan hopes to have self-driving cars on the road by 2020.     Tags: autonomous, driving, million, invested, volvo, working, Other stories from today: Self-driving car race sees flurry of partnerships Gap offers muted outlook for annual earnings, lower profit Twitter to let all users filter tweets for higher ‘quality’     Print this Page  |  << Back   Return To Archives            Daily Journal Quick Poll   For what are you most thankful?

The $600 Acer Switch Alpha 12 offers 90% of a Surface Pro, at almost half the cost. While Acer’s brand doesn’t portend quality, their latest 2-in-1 hybrid offers every bit the refinement of a Surface. So should you buy the Acer Switch Alpha 12? If you’re looking for a 2-in-1 convertible tablet and can’t afford a Surface, the Alpha offers a reliable alternative. Those seeking perfection should look elsewhere. If $600 is still a little out of your budget, then no worries: we’re giving ours away to one lucky reader! Enter below for your chance to win. Acer Switch Alpha 12 Giveaway Aesthetics, Design, and Hardware Look and Feel The Acer Switch Alpha 12 looks and feels like a premium tablet, with a somewhat dated brushed aluminum back and rounded corners. In terms of how it feels, Acer went a great deal out of its way to shave down every sharp edge. The streamlined result – while somewhat cumbersome – comes off as pleasant to hold, for brief periods of time. Most users won’t notice the difference between the heft of an Alpha compared to the Surface. In truth, there are few 12-inch tablets out there that you could comfortably hold for any period of time. Ads by Google Of particular note is the Switch Alpha’s kickstand, which allows users to reposition the tablet in several different configurations. Compared to the borderline defective kickstand on the Surface, the Switch Alpha’s design is robust, stiff, and comes with a rubber grip. The grip doubles as a handle, allowing users to hold the tablet in either hand with the keyboard detached. Users can also wield the Alpha with its keyboard folded back, although in this configuration the tablet weighs 2.8kg — which isn’t much less than a 12-inch laptop. While not aesthetically superior to the Surface, in terms of functionality, the Alpha possesses three distinct advantages: First, the kickstand maintains a much stronger, stiffer hinge than the angled flap on the Surface. Second, it’s completely fanless, which means the Alpha runs silently even with its processor running full blast. Third – a backlit keyboard comes included – and it doesn’t feel like a shabby, rattling piece of garbage. The keyboard feels and looks almost as good as the Surface’s, with one shortcoming: its backlighting offers only a single brightness level. A fair compromise, considering the Alpha costs $300 less than the base-model Surface Pro. The price gap increases with higher end models. Hardware Acer ships the Alpha in a dozen different variations. Of these, the three most common versions are the low-end, mid-range, and high-end models. The lowest end of the spectrum comes with a Core i3 (the difference between Core processors Intel Core i3 vs. i5 vs. i7: Which One Do You Really Need?

The mid-tier platform includes a Core i5, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD for $800. Finally, the high-end model uses a Core i7, 8GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD — and it runs for $1,000. I’m unsure as to why Acer doesn’t offer any model with 16GB of RAM. Even though most modern computing tasks don’t require large amounts of RAM, enough users use virtual machines or do heavy-duty video editing, which might lead to sales for their ultra high-end models. Even so, 4GB should be sufficient for the majority of users as the current design of Windows 10, which uses RAM compression How RAM Compression Improves Memory Responsiveness in Windows 10 How RAM Compression Improves Memory Responsiveness in Windows 10 Windows 10 introduced a new feature called RAM compression. This new memory management routine improves system responsiveness. Here we show you how RAM compression works, how to turn it off, and how it impacts performance. Read More , makes 4GB of RAM an adequate amount. The rest of the Alpha’s specifications are standard across all models. Although rumored to offer a 1080p variant, all models include a 2K screen, with a resolution of 2160 x 1440 pixels. It also uses a 2×2 MIMO 802.11ac dual-band (what’s dual band? How Dual-Band Routers Can Solve Your Wireless Woes How Dual-Band Routers Can Solve Your Wireless Woes Using a router that supports the dual-band standard can significantly boost your Wi-Fi speeds in many circumstances. Read More ) wireless adapter. It’s also the heaviest out of all the Surface clones, weighing in at around 2.8 pounds, with the keyboard attached. That’s about 15% heavier than the Surface Pro 4. In truth though, it’s hard to differentiate between a 2.8-pound device and a 2.4-pound one. Ports, Cameras, and Buttons The Switch Alpha includes a generous serving of ports – more than any other 2-in-1 on the planet. The right-side of the tablet houses a 3.5″ audio jack, a USB 3.0 port, a USB 3.1 Type-C port (what’s USB-C? What Is USB Type-C? What Is USB Type-C? Ah, the USB plug. It is as ubiquitous now as it is notorious for never being able to be plugged in right the first time. Read More ), a proprietary charging port, and a microSD card slot. It’s worth mentioning that the Alpha can receive a charge from its USB-C port at the same rate of speed as the barrel jack connector. That’s fantastic design. It charges at around 19v/2.37a, which means it can receive 45-watts of power — with the right charger. Unfortunately, many USB-C chargers simply won’t function as advertised. I tested the Alpha’s USB-C charging capabilities using a Lumsing 48-watt USB-C charger. The Lumsing charger manages to output around 20-watts, which indicates power delivery somewhere around 12.5v/2a. On the left-side of the tablet rests three aluminum buttons: A home-screen button, volume rocker, and power button. It also sports two cameras: a front-facing web camera and a rear-facing 5MP camera. Neither camera works with Windows Hello How to Log Into Windows 10 With Finger Scans & Facial Recognition How to Log Into Windows 10 With Finger Scans & Facial Recognition Instead of using a password or PIN, you might be better off using fingerprint scans or facial recognition!

Apparently, Windows Hello requires infrared capabilities, which most of today’s web-cameras lack. Even so, the Surface Pro 4 does offer Windows Hello, and that’s a fairly significant advantage. Screen Quality While writing this review, a question gnawed at me – where did Acer cut corners to hit a $600 entry-level price point? The second cheapest alternative to the Alpha is the HP Spectre x2, which costs $200 more and comes with a Core M processor. And HP cut a lot off its display – the Spectre includes only a 1080p resolution screen. But Acer’s 2-in-1 comes with a 2160 x 1440 screen. One of the places Acer cut corners: battery life. The LCD panel used in the Alpha doesn’t appear to offer the latest standard in power stretching technology – Panel Self Refresh (PSR). PSR allows devices to switch off the device’s graphics processor for as long as the image displayed does not change. PSR on average extends battery life by about an hour. But when a device shows a still image most of the time (such as reading), the battery life can skyrocket by as much as 26%, according to the consortium governing the Embedded DisplayPort standard. Unfortunately, the LCD panel used in the Alpha doesn’t appear to offer PSR technology. This is an unfortunate omission for a 2-in-1 device that might often function as an e-reader. Even so, the tradeoff between quality and price might not deter someone looking to save hundreds over a Surface. Performance Because you more than likely won’t use the Switch Alpha with manufacturer bloatware included, I’m performing benchmarks on a clean configuration. Windows 10 makes the de-bloat process How to Easily Remove Bloatware From Windows 10 How to Easily Remove Bloatware From Windows 10 Windows 10 comes with several pre-installed apps that take up space on your device and aren't easy to remove.

Unlike the majority of Surface clones, the Switch Alpha doesn’t use the slower Core M processor Intel Core M: What's so Great About the Processor? Intel Core M: What's so Great About the Processor? The Intel Core M is the most hyped processor in years, and with good reason: it's at the heart of a new revolution in laptops. Read More , which is a fanless, reduced-power variant of Intel’s “mainstream” mobile Core i processors. The Core M processors typically offer better performance than Intel’s Atom processors, such as those used in regular Surface 3, but with worse performance than even a Core i3-6100U. So, comparing the low-end Switch Alpha to the entry-level Surface 4 Pro, you get better performance for around $400 less. The one area in which it compares poorly to the Surface Pro: battery life. Battery Life The worst, perhaps deal-breaking, feature of the Switch Alpha: poor battery life. Users won’t get more than 5 hours of uptime on a single charge. In truth, no 2-in-1 device with a mainstream Intel processor offers more than 6 hours of standard use. The reason stems from the thinness of the tablet form-factor; the thinner a device, the smaller its battery size. In theory, Acer’s fanless cooling system should help offset its diminutive battery. In practice, it loses at least an hour of uptime compared to its competition. Tinkerers can increase the length of their device’s battery life by optimizing their wireless connection (at the expense of connection reliability), optimizing their graphics processor for maximum battery life, de-bloating their system of apps, and entering battery life mode. With these modifications, battery life increases substantially, but I found that the length of up-time relates more closely to the kind of activities being performed, rather than the implementation of any specific or combination of user-configurable battery life optimizations. In short, here’s what I found out: Battery life for standard use: ~5 hours. Reading: ~8-10 hours. Gaming: 3-4 hours. By any standard, these are mediocre at best battery life numbers. While you could easily find budget laptops with worse battery lives, in the $600 price range, some devices can outlast the Alpha by a factor of two or even three. Of course, none of those devices would be 2-in-1 hybrids with mainstream Intel processors. Windows Ink In the Windows Anniversary Update (AU), Microsoft added a unique feature for Windows convertible 2-in-1 tablets: Windows Ink. It’s little more than a note-taking application, but it makes drawing notes using a stylus much easier. Users only need to click on the Ink icon in the taskbar to begin sketching. However, Acer did not include a stylus with its Alpha starter package, and so I was unable to test this feature. The pressure-sensitive stylus offers 256 degrees of pressure, which makes it on par with the Surface Pro 3. Liquid Cooling Traditionally, laptops use mobile processors that require a fan. Fans come with four problems: First, they can suck up a fair amount of wattage, thus they incur additional drain on the battery. Second, fans can produce a lot of noise. Third, fans take up a lot of space, which results in a thicker tablet. Lastly, fans break down over time through a combination of wear and tear, and dust accumulation. Acer’s LiquidLoop cooling system dispenses with a fan. It uses a heat pipe design, which transmits thermal waste energy from the processor into the aluminum shell of the tablet. The loop style design helps distribute heat throughout the entirety of the metal shell, which aids thermal dissipation. After stress testing (using Prime95) the Acer for an hour, the temperature rose as high as 75 degrees Celsius, which approaches the thermal shutdown limit of the processor (which is probably somewhere between 80 and 90 degrees Celsius). I don’t have a thermal temperature reader, but I estimate the metal body of the Acer to reach somewhere around 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Not exactly burn-inducing, but definitely on the threshold of discomfort. Fanless cooling systems rely extensively on the ambient temperature. The hotter the weather, the less efficient the cooling system. Therefore, someone living along the equator might prefer an active cooling system. Fortunately, no one in their right mind runs software similar to Prime95 for an hour on a 2-in-1 device. Overall, I would judge Acer’s cooling system as excellent. Hopefully, other manufacturers adopt it. Otherwise, we’re stuck with the lackluster Core M processor in the short term. Warranty and Reliability Acer bumped up the Alpha’s warranty to a whopping two years! That’s double the warranty offered by the Surface Pro 4 and beats all competitors within the 2-in-1 hybrid tablet market — which is amazing on a $600 device. Acer might feel confident about the long-term durability because of its fanless cooling system and lack of moving parts. It’s not a standard warranty, either. It’s a “traveler’s warranty” which covers multiple regions and includes both ship-in and ship-out costs. I’m still waiting on an iFixit teardown (this review will receive an update once that becomes available). From what I can tell, the Switch Alpha employs standard Philips screws, which anchor its rear panel in place. Should You Buy the Acer Switch Alpha 12? What’s Great?

What’s Not So Good? Not compatible with Windows Hello Loaded with bloatware What’s Terrible? 3-4 Hours of battery life for gaming The price difference is so enormous; I can’t see myself recommending the Surface over a Switch Alpha. The 2 years of warranty really put the Switch Alpha over the top. Those looking for a cheaper version of the Surface should check out the Switch Alpha. It performs on the same level, offers superior build quality, but loses about an hour (or more) of battery life in comparison. For those looking for a perfect 2-in-1, you’re better off with a Surface.

I bought the Acer Switch Alpha 12 (i5-6200U, 8GB, 256GB SSD) at Costco last week for $699, which includes the stylus, keyboard, 90-day money back return privilege, Concierge technical support, and 2nd-year free warranty. I am a longtime 'Tablet PC' user. In fact, the Switch will replace my beloved Lenovo X200T. So far I am very impressed with this little machine, although I am still learning some of the quirks. It's smaller and lighter than most of the folders I carry back forth between work & home. Battery life has been fine for me - lasts all day long at work doing typical office tasks including PDF editing. I also watch a few YouTube Excel tutorials during the day. The Switch feels as solid as my iPad 2 and I am pleased with its build quality so far. My stylus' buttons tended to stick at first but loosened with use; they're fine now. The stylus is fine for my tasks; I'm not an artist trying to do serious graphics work on a low-cost portable. The stylus uses one (1) AAAA (four A) battery, and it appears to turn itself odd after a period of nonuse. Clicking one of its buttons wakes it up instantly. The screen is gorgeous. The stand is very sturdy, as reported, and the keyboard can flip alt the way around and tuck under the display (if you don't want to detach it). The keyboard has a raised perimeter to protect the keys when the keyboard is tucked under, and the keys are disabled in that mode. Attached to the left side of the keyboard is a simple loop to store the stylus. I would have preferred something on the tablet itself for when the keyboard is left behind. I am not a fan of Apple-style click trackpads but this one seems to work OK. I am still learning the different touch gestures and such (screen as well as the trackpad). Mine did not have much 'bloatware' preinstalled although there were a couple of shortcuts to install some extras if desired. The included Acer utilities are minimalist. Or maybe I was just spoiled by Lenovo's ThnkVantage suite. I have not yet updated to the Windows 10 Anniversary edition but plan to do so soon. Reply Kannon Y September 10, 2016 at 3:19 pm That's also my impression of the Switch Alpha: Great tablet, low price. I hope more people buy this thing because it's definitely worth the money. Reply Kannon Yamada November 15, 2016 at 3:24 am Hi SamCal, I contacted Acer regarding some of the points that you've brought up. The Switch is fully Windows 10 AU compliant, so it updated without a hitch. So far I'm getting improved battery life. Also, they confirmed that the warranty includes 2-years (SHIPPING COSTS PAID BY ACER!). The warranty is what put it over the top for me. I went out and bought one for myself and bumped the score up to 10/10, based mainly on the degree of value it offers. It's a really stellar 2-in-1.

Previous models in the Switch range have been modest performers that relied on Intel's Core M processors, but the Alpha 12 steps up to true laptop levels of performance with the latest Skylake processors and provides a cost-effective alternative to Microsoft's Surface Pro 4. UK prices for the Switch Alpha 12 start at just £549.99 (inc. VAT, or £458.32 ex. VAT) for the entry-level model reviewed here, which is based on a Core i3-6100U processor running at 2.3GHz. This model includes 4GB of RAM and 128GB of solid-state storage, along with a detachable keyboard and a stylus. In contrast, Microsoft's Surface Pro starts at £749 (inc. VAT, or £624.17 ex. VAT) with just a Core M processor, and no keyboard (which costs about £100 extra) so Acer certainly wins on sheer value for money. There's also an i5 model with 8GB of RAM for £749.99 inc. VAT (or £625 ex. VAT), while the top-of-the-range i7 configuration includes 8GB memory and a 256GB SSD for a still-competitive £899.99 (inc. VAT or £750 ex. VAT). Those prices include Windows 10 Home, but Windows 10 Pro is also available for business users for an additional £50 (inc. VAT, or £41.67 ex. VAT). Acer's 12-inch Switch Alpha 12 runs on Core i3/5/7 processors and starts at £549.99 (inc. VAT), including stylus and keyboard. Image: Acer Taking the stand The design of the Switch Alpha 12 is conventional enough, but still highly practical. On its own, the 12-inch tablet measures 10mm thick and weighs 0.9kg, which is a little heavy for a tablet of this size, and you'll probably need to hold it with both hands when it's not resting on your lap or on a desk. However, the aluminium case does feel very sturdy, and more than capable of surviving the occasional bump when you're travelling. We also like the fold-out stand on the back of the tablet, which can easily be adjusted to improve visibility. Connections include USB 3.0 and USB-C ports. Image: Acer There's a 2MP webcam on the front of the tablet, along with a 5MP rear-facing camera. Tucked onto the right-hand edge of the tablet you'll find both USB 3 and USB-C ports, along with a MicroSD card slot. However, we'd question the wisdom of putting the power socket and headphone socket so close together on that side of the device. We almost plugged the power supply into the headphone socket on more than one occasion -- which is something you'll probably want to avoid. The snap-on keyboard is a comfortable platform for fast typing, although we were less impressed with the trackpad. Image: Acer The keyboard works well, and is a welcome addition at this price. It snaps easily into place using magnetic contacts, and the keyboard panel is angled slightly upwards so that it feels more comfortable than simply lying flat on your desk. There's a decent amount of travel on the keys too, and it certainly feels more suited to fast typing than many of the flat-panel keyboards we've seen recently. The keyboard brings the total weight of the device to 1.25kg, but that's still lighter than many conventional laptops. In fact, our only complaint here is that the trackpad doesn't work quite so well. The pressure needed to click the trackpad seems to vary across the surface of the trackpad, and it sometimes rattles quite audibly when you tap to select items. That's a minor complaint though, and the keyboard will certainly allow you to use the Switch Alpha 12 as a serious working laptop when you need to. Picture & performance Top ZDNET Reviews Dell Latitude 11 5000 7.9 Apple iPhone 7 Plus 9.3 Amazon Echo 9.0 Google Pixel XL Phone 8.0 The display of the Switch Alpha 12 is another strong point. The 12-inch IPS panel has a resolution of 2,160 by 1,440 pixels, which at 216ppi is lower than the 2,736 by 1,824 and 267ppi of the 12.3-inch Surface Pro, but still more than adequate for high-definition video. The image quality is extremely good too -- bright and colourful, with close to full 180-degree viewing angles all around, so it'll work well for impromptu presentations when you're on the road. The stereo speakers sound a little tinny, but they're loud enough for watching streaming video or giving a presentation in a coffee shop. The Switch 12 Alpha will also be fast enough to handle presentations and other Microsoft Office apps, even with the entry-level Core i3/4GB configuration. Our review unit achieved a multiprocessor score of 5540 when running the Geekbench 3 test suite, compared to 4863 for the entry-level Core M version of the Surface Pro, or 5474 for Apple's even more expensive 12.9-inch iPad Pro. Graphics performance was a pleasant surprise too, with the integrated HD 520 graphics managing a quite respectable 39fps when running the Cinebench R15 OpenGL graphics benchmark. That's only a sliver behind the 40.3fps of the more expensive i5 version of the Surface Pro 4. We were also pleased to see -- or rather hear -- that the Switch Alpha 12 runs silently, thanks to Acer's fanless LiquidLoop cooling system. And, of course, if you need even more power then the i5 and i7 models are available at equally competitive prices. The only real disappointment is battery life. The sheer brightness of the display allowed us to turn the brightness down to 50 percent while streaming video from the BBC iPlayer, but even then the 37Wh battery in the Switch Alpha 12 only managed to last for a modest 4 hours 20 minutes. Less intensive use might allow you to stretch that closer to five hours, but that's still below par for a modern tablet or laptop. Conclusions There's room for improvement when it comes to battery life, and business travellers who spend a lot of time on trains and planes might want to pay a little extra for a longer-lasting device. Even so, Acer's Switch Alpha 12 is still very good value for money, and delivering decent performance and a high-quality display for a device costing just £550 (inc. VAT). And, with the keyboard and stylus included as standard features, the Switch Alpha 12 has a real edge over most of its convertible rivals.
