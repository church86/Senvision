Apple seems to be within striking distance of Intel's best ultra-low-power notebook and convertible processors. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Sep 12, 2016 at 5:19PM Image source: Intel.  If there's one company in the industry that seems to be able to challenge Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in terms of mobile processors, it's Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The latter has been making significant strides in its mobile processor technology, which allowed it to come within striking distance of Intel's best ultra-low-power processors with its A9X chip. Indeed, according to Geekbench 4 -- a new performance test that allows for cross-platform comparisons of processor capabilities -- the A9X chip inside the iPad Pro manages to score 3011 points in the single-core test and 4882 in the multi-core test. The top score that I could find for Intel's best 4.5-watt Core m processor, the Core m 6Y75, is a single-core score of 3677 and a multi-core score of 6983. Based on these results, Intel's chip is solidly in the lead, and Intel has a new chip for this segment based on its new Kaby Lake architecture out. However, based on the performance results of Apple's new A10 Fusion chip inside the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, the competition between Intel and Apple for mobile processor performance superiority is sure to heat up. Trying to predict the future The highest A10 Fusion score I could find in the Geekbench 4 data base is 3501 on a single core and 5631 when both cores are active. This means that, at least in Geekbench 4, the A10 Fusion has roughly the same single-core processor performance as Intel's top sixth-generation Core m processor. Intel's chip still has a lead-in multi-core, though, probably because Intel's core implements a feature known as Simultaneous Multi-Threading, which allows for better utilization of a core's resources in applications that can take advantage of multiple cores. However, the A10 Fusion to Core m 6Y75 comparison isn't that interesting. What will be much more interesting is the comparison of the upcoming A10X (Fusion?) that will be used in Apple's 2017 iPad lineup with Intel's recently announced 4.5-watt Core i7-7Y75, the direct replacement for the Core m 6Y75. With the A10X, Apple will enjoy an expanded power budget and is expected to migrate to a new 10-nanometer manufacturing technology from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM). These factors combined should allow Apple to crank up the processor performance inside its next-generation tablet processor. The Core i7-7Y75 from Intel is manufactured on Intel's revised 14-nanometer+ process, which allows the company to dial up the maximum single-core turbo on the chip from 3.1GHz on the 6Y75 to 3.6GHz on the 7Y75, a 16% improvement. If performance on the 7Y75 scales linearly with frequency in the Geekbench 4 test, we should see a single-core score of roughly 4265 and a multi-core score of about 8100. Moving to the A10X, let's assume that the delta between the A10 and A10X is roughly the same as the delta between the A9 and A9X. The A9X's single core score was about 21% better than the A9's and the multi-core score was about 17% better. In that case, our hypothetical A10X should get a single-core score of 4236 and a multi-core score of 6588.27. In tasks that use just a single core, the A10X should be roughly even with the Core i7-7Y75 and behind it in tasks that use multiple cores. Apple is really close to Intel It's clear that in terms of per-core performance in ultra-mobile power envelopes, Apple and Intel are essentially within spitting distance of each other. This isn't a knock on Intel, but rather a demonstration of just how good Apple's processor core development team is. In multi-core performance, Intel should still enjoy a lead. However, I wouldn't be surprised to see Apple's engineers implement simultaneous multithreading in a future processor core -- perhaps in the A11/A11X -- to try to close the multi-core gap with Intel. In this case, Apple could market future iPads as having similar performance to its future top-end thin-and-light MacBooks -- an exciting prospect for iPad users, but perhaps an uncomfortable one for Intel.

A team has discovered that machine learning can extract maneuver and landscape data much faster in these virtual settings than with traditional methods. Using computer vision algorithms, the team labeled thousands of images in just a few hours, which will be used to teach autonomous cars to recognize different objects.

Gathering this information is usually conducted by researchers, who comb through scenes from real life footage and draw borders around objects by hand.

HOW DOES THE AI WORK?  Using computer vision algorithms, the team can label thousands of objects in a few hours, which can be used to teach self-driving object recognition.  To begin their work, researchers extracted 25 thousand frames from Grand Theft Auto V that varied in weather conditions and took place during different times of day Grand Theft Auto may not be the first place you'd go to learn better driving skills, but researchers are using this fictional world to train self-driving cars. Pictured are the colours used by the AI to label objects in Grand Theft Auto V Then, using computer vision algorithms, the team annotated all of the images in just 49 hours. For each image taken from the game, the team added a corresponding ID map  that identifies the mesh, texture and shade found with a specific pixel. Then the team broke down each image into patches for pixels that share common characteristics.

Then the team broke down each image into patches for pixels that share common characteristics 'Although the source code and the internal operation of commercial games are inaccessible, we show that associations between image patches can be reconstructed from the communication between the game and the graphics hardware,' reads the paper. 'This enables rapid propagation of semantic labels within and across images synthesized by the game, with no access to the source code or the content.' Researchers believe this technology could be used to produce continuous video streams, in addition to using the system to produce ground-truth data for many dense prediction problems. Researchers believe this technology could be used to produce continuous video streams, in addition to, using the system to product ground-truth data for many dense prediction problems This new method will not only provide real world scenarios for self-driving cars to learn, but it is also less time consuming and demanding. The current method requires human researchers to comb through scenes and draw borders around objects 'Annotating real-world data is an expensive operation and the current approaches do not scale up easily,' Alizera Shafaei, a PhD student at the University of British Columbia (UBC) who recently coauthored a paper showing how video games can be used to train a computer vision system, in some cases as well as real data can, told MIT News. 'With artificial environments we can effortlessly gather precisely annotated data at a larger scale with a considerable amount of variation in lighting and climate settings.' 'We showed that this synthetic data is almost as good, or sometimes even better, than using real data for training.' GOOGLE REVEALS STRANGE THINGS ITS CARS HAVE SEEN In a recent monthly report, Google highlighted a few of these bizarre incidents, which the firm says are key to the cars ability to deal with unpredictable road behavior.  In Mountain View, California Google's self-driving car witnessed a broom wielding woman chasing a duck in the ride while riding an electric wheel chair. Another strange incident occurred at an intersection, when three non-related cars each made a turn down a one-way, which was the opposite way they were traveling. However, Chris Urmson, director of Google's self-driving car project, says Austin 'takes the cake'. A group of children were seen playing Frogger around the autonomous vehicle. A separate occasion, a man came out of nowhere and rolled over the hood of the car - similar to the move in Starksy & Hutch. And finally, a gentleman was so excited to see the Google car on his street that he ran out completely naked. 'On our private test track, we've dreamt up and recreated hundreds of odd scenarios to gauge our car's response, but situations like these demonstrate why public testing of our self-driving cars is important to developing our cars for the road,' Google stated in the firm's March report detailing its autonomous vehicle progress. 'We can try to come up with lots of wacky situations for our cars to handle, but the real world can defy even our wildest imaginations.'    Read more: Self-Driving Cars Can Learn a Lot by Playing Grand Theft Auto download.visinf....

It's all "inside baseball" and our traffic patterns suggest that our audience isn't terribly interested in inside baseball unless it's a really big deal. Well, within the API economy, you'd be hard-pressed to find a bigger deal than Google acquiring API management solution provider Apigee. On the one hand, no one I know saw this coming. On the other, we might have anticipated it. Hindsight is, of course 20/20.  So, how did we get to this point in the API economy's history? First and foremost, some interesting numbers: Apigee went public in April 2015 at $17 per share and it's been a bit of a rocky ride ever since. On the day of its IPO, it briefly rose to $20 per share before closing on the downside at $16.68. Google has agreed to acquire Apigee for $625M which works out to be about $17.40 per share. During Apigee's outing as a public company, some pundits were mistakenly bullish. In 2014, on the eve of Apigee's IPO, SeekingAlpha's Don Dion called it the "Tech Buy of the Week." In September 2015, Zacks Equity Research called Apigee "a great momentum stock." I have no insight into whether Apigee's investors got what they hoped for (sometimes they take the money and run at the IPO, other times not). But I know enough to know that most public companies do not view an acquisition at 40 cents north of their IPO price to be a stellar outcome. For Google though, it was a good deal. Maybe not as good as it would have been had it tried to make the buy in February when the company was trading at its 52-week low of $5.35. In its coverage of the deal, Recode said that "sources in the industry applauded the deal as smart (and thrifty) for Google." While I'm sure no one at Google sneezed at the deal, perhaps it helps to put it into financial perspective: Google's total value (its market cap) typically fluctates on a daily basis by more than 10x the price it paid for Apigee. Google's acquisition of Apigee is the third such acquisition of an API management pure play in the last year (give or take a few days). By "API management pure play," I mean a solution provider that focuses exclusively on the management of the API lifecycle. In August 2015, Tibco, a company more traditionally know for solutions that dealt with enterprise integration and the business logic-driven hosting and choreography of event-driven workflows, acquired Mashery from Intel. Intel had previously acquired Mashery in April 2013 for about $180 million.  Then, in June of this year, Red Hat, another company with strengths in integration and business logic, announced it would be acquiring API management pure-play 3Scale. And now, Google is acquiring Apigee.  To the untrained eye, the pattern isn't so clear. But to just about anybody that keeps an eye on the integration and API management sectors, it should be obvious. Back in the old days of XML-RPC styled Web services (which are not very old) and beyond, the art of meshing large often dissimilar software systems involved a fair amount of business logic that lived at the heart of what would become known as an integration platform. Deep inside, often driven by Java source code that mirrored an enterprise's business processes, these platforms could support the sort of workflows whereby data flowing from one foreign system to another could be transformed and massaged for suitability to the recipient. And just some data's sudden arrival into one of these workflows was treated as an event that might trigger some other business process that was hosted by the same platform. Typically, wiring these platforms up to the various enterprise systems like those from Oracle or SAP required bespoke software connectors; essentially compatability shims that lived between the integration platform and the softwares that were being pulled into the integration mix. If you were to diagram it, the brains (to handle the business logic) were in the middle with the connectors on the edge, living in the seams between the business logic and the foreign systems. Then, Web APIs came along and, to make a long story short, due to their reliance on existing HTTP standards (HTTP is the standard protocol that makes the Web tick), they started to take a lot of the bespokeness out of the bespoke connectors. Though very different architecturally from their predecessors, fundamentally, APIs didn't change the arrangement of the diagram. Where APIs were replacing connectors (and continue to do so), they were still pretty much at the edge, dealing with the seam. As the world began its shift to Web APIs at the edge, there developed a need for products and services to manage their sprawl and lifecycle which in turn gave rise to API management startups.  One API management pure play -- Mashery -- was probably the first to act on the opportunity. Back in 2006, when I founded Mashup Camp -- the industry's first event to focus exclusively on Web APIs -- one of the event's first sponsors to get in line to talk about what he was up to was Oren Michels; then the founder of Mashery. Clearly a visionary, Michels was talking about the need to manage Web APIs before most people knew what a Web API even was. So new was his startup that he was emailing me from his inbox at mit.edu instead of mashery.com. As a side note (and for those of you who like to connect the dots), the first Mashup Camp in February 2006 at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View is where I met and became great friends with John Musser who had just founded ProgrammableWeb. As the API economy blossomed and the need for API management became more apparent, other pure-plays raced to help tame the edge. One of those was Apigee whose flagship offering is not surprisingly named Apigee Edge. The race included others like Layer 7 and 3Scale. But, as strong as these pure-plays were at what they did, they lacked a part of the diagram that was still important to enterprises; a platform of any sort to deal with business logic (be that for integration or even for a regular business application). As it turned out for their investors, this omission would serve them pretty well because as pure plays, they could be paired with platform providers who one-day woke up to the reality that they had better get hitched to an API management solution. While Web APIs were becoming all the rage at the edge and guys like Oren Michels were right about the need to manage them, enterprises' need to accomodate the business logic part of the diagram was showing no signs of slowing down. Back in the integration world, a small handful of vendors -- Akana (formerly SOA Software), MuleSoft, and WSO2 -- who had found success in providing the logic platforms and connectors looked at the API onslaught and saw the opportunity for a natural marriage to offer what many customers wanted; a single throat to choke for both integration and API management. The result? In the 2012-2013 timeframe, they scrambled their engineering teams to add API management into their product and service portfolios; endeavors that all continue to this day (disclosure: MuleSoft acquired ProgrammableWeb in 2013). Despite routine derision of this marriage by the pure plays as a part of their competitive messaging, the trend that led us up to this week's acquisition of Apigee by Google clearly validates the early thinking that customers are better served by solutions that that can simultaneously deal with both business logic and API management.  While Akana, MuleSoft, and WSO2 chose to engineer their way to such diversification, the first integration vendor to buy its way into a marriage with API management was probably Axway when it acquired Vordel in late 2012.  That was followed by the first acquisition of Mashery by Intel and CA's acquisition of Layer 7 in April 2013. In October of that year, Microsoft saw the potential in the marriage of platform and APIs and acquired Apiphany. In a bit of reporting for ProgrammableWeb that was eerily clairvoyant when it came to Amazon and Google, Michael Vizard wrote: Microsoft immediately turned off the API management service; at least in terms of signing up new customers. Given that the acquisition of Apihany was led by the Microsoft Azure group the expectation is that the Apiphany technology will one day reemerge as a service on Azure. In fact, Microsoft’s end game appears to be an effort to develop an API ecosystem around Azure that will attract enough applications to give the cloud platform the critical mass it needs to compete with rival public cloud services from Amazon and Google. As cloud computing and the API economy increasing converge, major cloud platform providers are trying to ensure their long term viability by creating zones they can dominate within the larger API economy. Google and Amazon have both famously tied the knot between their platforms and API management (although Amazon is still very early in its journey). But not before Intel realized it didn't own a real spouse for Mashery and set about finding one in Tibco, who, as more of a traditional integration company, lacked the prescience in the 2012/2013 timeframe to diversify by building or buying. Likewise, Red Hat may have waited too long to recognize the importance of API management to the customers of its various platforms (especially the Java-driven JBOSS). It dipped its toe in the water with an open source API management solution called APIMAN but ultimately resorted to buying its way into the business with its acquisition of 3Scale. APIMAN is being sunsetted and any of Red Hat's customers looking for ongoing support when it comes to API management will have to transition to the 3Scale technology. Such surprises can be painful and speak to the need to interrogate your solution providers to make sure they (a) have a very clear vision when it comes to the future and (b) are committed to that vision.  Meanwhile, Red Hat wasted no time in drawing attention to the kind of success that's produced when a single vendor can cover a customer for both platform and API management when it announced that Norwegian airport express train operator Flytoget signed up as a customer of both Red Hat's JBoss Fuse and 3Scale's API management technology "as part of an initiative to digitise and automate the company's key value chain." Then, over the course of the last couple of years and in their efforts to marry their development platforms to API management, Amazon, IBM (Bluemix), and Microsoft (Azure) have signficantly ramped their API management capabilities (partially fulfilling Vizard's prohecy regarding Microsoft's acquisition of Apiphany). Earlier this week, when I was at the Government API meetup in Washington, DC (a great meetup if you can ever make it), a group of us were talking about the pattern of API pure plays getting married-off to platform vendors as we tried to answer the question of who would propose to Apigee (it has been no secret that Apigee was looking for a buyer). We ran down the list of possibilities. SAP? Oracle? Both could benefit from a marriage to API management. Perhaps Microsoft or IBM? While they have pre-existing technologies, both are keen to gain more customers and have proven willing to do it through acquisition. The exercise was mainly one of looking for a platform provider of any type that was missing the API management puzzle piece. Never did we guess Google.  But in hindsight, we should have. Google practically gave birth to the API economy when it launched the first Web API (Google Maps) in 2005. Very few companies understand APIs, and invests in them, the way Google does. Not just in providing them the way many other API providers do. But also in advancing the technology behind them. For example, gRPC and Protocol Buffers; both of which could shape the future of APIs. It was just last week that ProgrammableWeb wrote about Google getting serious about API management with the launch of its beta of Google Cloud Endpoints; a solution that can churn out an API for anything you've built on any of the Google Cloud Platform offerings (App Engine, Container Engine and Compute Engine). Applications? Microservices? It doesn't matter. They all need logic. So, very clearly, Google is positioning its solutions to be very prolific providers of APIs. But, whereas Google Cloud Endpoints primarily handles the development and provisioning part, what about the rest of the API lifecycle? Those APIs would have to be managed. So here again, much the same way that Akana, Axway, CA, MuleSoft, and WSO2 set themselves on a strategic course to marry platform with API management nearly four years ago (and others since), Google has recognized the strategic importance of a similar union.  Moving forward however, the acquisition raises several interesting questions and possibilities. For example, Apigee has previously partnered with Amazon to show how to use Apigee for AWS-powered applications. Given that Google Cloud Platform and Amazon AWS are now such fierce competitors in the cloud, will Google be so willing to partner with Amazon (or vice versa) on such endeavors in the future and where does that leave customers of the AWS-specific reference architecture offered by Apigee? [updated after original publication:] Another question, posed in one of the comments below is what this means long-term for Apigee's on-premise solutions given how Google's cloud positioning pretty much eschews anything on-prem. In response, another commenter pointed out how Google senior vice president Diane Greene mentioned in her announcement that Google remains committed to supporting an on-prem solution. Additionally, one of Apigee's strengths was its independence. Most companies could do business with Apigee and remain relatively assured that Apigee would not go into competition with them. Given the many business sectors that Google currently competes in (or may venture into), there's now a stronger possibility that some of Apigee's existing customers and prospects could view Apigee as a foe rather than a friend. What then? What do you think about the acquisition and the long term trend? Is this the end or are there more acquisitions on the way? Feel free to comment below and I'll be sure to respond.

I am been following Apigee since the Sonoa days and believe the acquisition makes a lot of sense, especially to help Google drive into the enterprise space. 2 questions: 1) Would it put a question mark behin Apigee's on-premise offering? Google is know to not believe anything not in the cloud. 2) Would Oracle acquiring Amberpoint back in 2010 qualify as an early version of the trend you cite? david_berlind 8:26 AM Sep. 10 2016 reply Hi @spacelord and thanks so much for replying. In answer to your questions,  1. I think that's just another question worth asking at this point. I am trying to think of an on-premise solution offered by Google and I cannot think of one. That doesn't mean that one doesn't exist. It's just that one doesn't come to mind at the moment.  2. The question you're really asking is whether the acquisition of an older SOA governance solution like Amberpoint qualifies and I just think that depends on your point if view. There's a POV that Services Oriented Infrastructure (SOA) is synonomous with RPC-styled Web services and that Web APIs are something so entirely different that they can barely be discussed in the same breath. It's no surprise that SOA Software changed its name (to Akana). It didn't want the SOA stereotype to sully it's positioning in the API space. If this is your POV, then I'd say the answer is "no" because you've already drawn a line in the sand and one doesn't necessarily carry over into the other. But, my personal POV (and I'm sure I'll get some grief for this) is that Web APIs and the older XML-based APIs are both APIs and that the general architectural concept works off the idea that a software component can be turned into a networkable service to which other software can outsource their tasks. To me, they both fall under the rubric of service-orientation and a lot of people get hung up on semantics. "SOA" turned into a label that it should never have turned into because as a concept, I think Web APIs do a better job of capturing the spirit of service orientation then the older XML-RPC styled APIs do. One need only look at the microservices discussion to agree. Ultimately, microservices are services. Most of them are abstracted by RESTful Web APIs. Are we to suggest that is NOT a services oriented architecture? This is one reason ProgrammableWeb's data model is agnostic to these sorts of semantics.  So, back to Oracle, if acquiring Amberpoint also helped the company to set itself on a strategic path to manage APIs of any feather, to govern service regardless of type, then I'd say yes, it fits into the trend. For example, though we don't hear much about it, Oracle actually has an API management solution. I haven't looked closely, but I'll bet that while it can stand independently, it's also pretty well tuned to Oracle's other solutions. Check out the path in the URL for its home page: http://www.oracle.com/us/products/middleware/soa/api-management/overview... LOL! It's under "SOA." So, what I don't know is how or if Oracle's acquisition of Amberpoint is connected to Oracle's launch of it's API management product (Oct 2015). If they're connected, then absolutely, I think one could say that Amberpoint deserves to be on the timeline because it put Oracle on the path to where it is today.  michels 5:52 PM Sep. 10 2016 reply On the "on premise" solution - there's the Google Search Appliance, but my understanding is that it is being sunsetted. michels 5:48 PM Sep. 10 2016 reply Thanks for the very, very kind words, David. And, as always, your insight into how the pieces are arranging themselves.  When we started Mashery I had a bit of an idea of what we needed to do, but a big part of my "vision" was formed by the amazing people I talked to during our early years. Some of them invested, some joined the Mashery team, and others became customers. But two who were in neither camp stand out. The first is John Musser, who you mention. Rafer and I had previously founded a directory business, so we understood the value of a comprehensive directory to a developing ecosystem, and expected to build one as part of Mashery. But then I found out about programmableweb and this John Musser guy and reached out to him. My first trip on Mashery's dime was to Seattle to see John, who generously offered to meet with me and answer all of my questions even though our respective visions had no shortage of overlap.I quickly realized that Mashery and the entire market would be well served by leaving the directory business to John, and over the years we built a wonderful friendship (and I learned something every time I talked to him). The second, of course, is some guy who had enough vision to start doing events around APIs and founded Mashup Camp, which spawned thousands upon thousands of hackathons in every corner of the globe. For someone new to the API world, it was amazing to be able to attend an event where likeminded people coming at the API concept from all different directions could compare notes and learn from each other. Cheers to you! david_berlind 9:24 AM Sep. 12 2016 reply Hey Oren (@michels), Thanks for writing in here. On the Google Search Appliance, I considered that.... but then I recalled reading that it was being withdrawn from market (as you suggested). Then again, as pointed out by another commenter (@Nick), Diane Greene said that Google is committed to supporting on prem "as always."   Thanks for your kind words too. I agree on John and am thankful to have had the torch passed to me as we take ProgrammableWeb to the next level. So much has changed since those days. We have much work to do and a lot of it is at the foundational level. For example, we've been very busy building out our understanding and record of SDKs that go with all the APIs and we're tuned in like we've never been before to all the API versioning that's happening. So long as there are multiple versions of an API available to developers (not just older versions, but newer pre-release ones too), it changes the idea of having a single record for the closest-production API. So, we're modernizing our data model to reflect the maturity of the API lifecycle.  I'm not sure that we spawned thousands upon thousands of hackathons ... but those sure were the early days of hackathons and I can't be thankful enough for the number of enduring friendships with brilliant people that came as a result of that work. And, had we never done that, I would not be here today at ProgrammableWeb.  It's crazy how one decision (thanks to an after-hours conversation with Google and Flickr) can change your entire life. monohusche 11:18 PM Sep. 11 2016 reply Regarding question 1, not so sure that the picture is that black-and-white. First of all, Google seems to understand that for many enterprises (and that's where Google has to catch up), hybrid cloud is there to stay (at least for now). Hence their increasing involvement with OpenStack which is the main open source private cloud play. Besides, their strategy to world domination is not to exclude other architecture options than public cloud, but just making it easier with their own solutions. So for instance for container orchestration, they have successfully managed to make Kubernetes the main contender, partially by embracing other platforms than just Google Cloud. Of course hoping that a large percentage of potential customer still uses GCP as their public cloud choice, Given the clear synergies of API Mgmt and container orchestration/service discovery, they have announced that they will integrate Kubernetes and Apigee while making it work both in the public cloud and on-prem. see below. From the google blog: "Looking ahead, Kubernetes will be integrated to help enterprises get better control and visibility into how their internal systems talk to one another, an additional part of deploying services. As always, we'll make sure that these capabilities are available in the public clouds and can also be used on-premises." Nick david_berlind 9:03 AM Sep. 12 2016 reply @Nick, thanks so much for writing in with these great points and thanks for pointing out Greene's statement regarding on prem solutions (I've updated the post accordingly!). Although I'd point out that Greene wrote "As always, we'll make sure that these capabilities are available in the public clouds and can also be used on-premises."  On the one hand, "as always?" or is it really more recently in recognition of your point regarding the enterprise need for hybrid cloud support?  That said, she did say "public clouds" which leads you to believe that, at least in this case, she intends to remain cloud agnostic (as should be the case when Kubernetes is involved, right?).  On the "black and white" issue, I don't think I meant to imply that it's strictly a black and white question to the exclusion of all other questions. There are of course many more permutations and possibilities when you consider the great many situations where API management naturally fits like a puzzle piece to a much larger picture that's ultimately more complicated than the one I painted. But, the question still remains given the long-term trend of API management companies getting married off to one platform provider or another.  Today in APIsLatest news about the API economy and newest APIs, delivered daily: Subscribe Leave this field blank API University FOR API PROVIDERS What Are APIs and How Do They Work?8 Real World API Strategies and the Keys to Their SuccessHow To Find a Rockstar API Product Manager More for API Providers  › FOR DEVELOPERS How To Implement Deep Linking in iOSHow To Get Started With Twitter's FabricHow To Develop An Android Wear App More for Developers  › Advertisement   Additional Resources API Growth Charts, Industry Research & More Developer How-to's & Live Presentations Meet The Editors David Berlind Editor in Chief @dberlind Articles Wendell Santos Editor wendell78 Articles Advertisement     Directories & Listings API Directory Mashups and Applications SDKs & Libraries How To's, Source Code Resources About ProgrammableWeb Advertise FAQ Contributed Content Guidelines Get Paid to Write for ProgrammableWeb Contact Us Business & Legal Site Terms of Service Privacy Policy Subscribe Rss Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn

Matthew Heller September 9, 2016 | CFO.com | US share Tweet Email Print - Print + Email this article To* Please enter your email address* Subject* Comments* After five years under Intel’s wing, McAfee will become an independent entity again through a deal in which private-equity firm TPG will acquire a majority stake in the computer security provider. The transaction values McAfee at $4.2 billion including debt, considerably less than the $7.6 billion that Intel paid in 2011 as it diversified from its core business of designing computer chips. TPG, which is making a $1.1 billion equity investment, will own 51% of McAfee, with Intel retaining a 49% stake. Recommended Stories: M&A in 2017: Starting to Cool Off? GE Adds Two Startups to Industrial Internet Push Estee Lauder Buys Too Faced Brand for $1.45B In the first half of 2016, Intel’s security division generated $1.1 billion in revenue, up 11% on the year-ago period, but analysts have generally viewed the acquisition of McAfee as a disappointment. “As we collaborate with TPG to establish McAfee as an independent company, we will also share in the future success of the business and in the market demand for top-flight security solutions, creating long-term value for McAfee’s customers, partners, employees and Intel’s shareholders,” Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said in a news release. McAfee is best-known for antivirus programs that protect personal computers hard wired to corporate and personal networks. But as The New York Times reports, “The explosion of smartphones, tablets and laptops, all wirelessly connected to cloud computing systems, has changed the [security] industry. PC sales have shrunk for five years, too, changing Intel’s business plans.” In the security area, Intel has moved into other varieties of software aimed at preventing hackers from breaking into corporate networks. Jeff Pollard, an analyst with Forrester, told Forbes that McAfee is emerging from Intel with a gutted portfolio and its service offering has lost ground to competitors. “McAfee is in need of direction and a turnaround,” he said. TPG has a track record of successful tech deals and recently invested in internet security company Zscaler and information technology vendor Tanium. “Unlike those smaller investments in relatively new technology providers, McAfee gives entree to a host of corporate customers and a platform to make additional and potentially larger deals in cybersecurity,” The Wall Street Journal said.

The essentials: what you need Not sure what 'essentials' you'll need? Check in with your halls guide to find out what the university will be accommodating you with and what you'll be expected to bring. All hall rooms will cover a duvet, bedroom bin and very basic kitchen essentials, but if you're heading to a student house, you may need to start from scratch. Retailers to watch for some of the best bargains are: Wilko.com for cheap duvet sets and bedroom decor. Amazon for laptops and bulk-items like shampoos and toilet roll. Argos for cheap kitchen and bedroom electricals. Poundland for kitchen and bathroom cleaning products. ASDA for food staples and your weekly supermarket shop. eBay for cheap clothes, towels and everything in between. Ikea for £3.50 duvet covers and pots, pans and cutlery. Kettles, duvets, and kitchenware for under £20 Getting kitted out for campus can cost you, or the bank of mum and dad, a fortune. Plus, to make things worse, you feel like you need 'new' EVERYTHING - and you do, sort of. From desk lamps, to duvets and pillows, it all adds up - here's our checklist on how to get kitted out on a budget, from duvets, to dinner sets, towels, mugs and of course, a kettle. You can FINALLY get student discount It's no secret that university is expensive – but there's at least one upside.... Student discounts. Here are some of the best student discount deals going - including 5% off Apple. Your university will provide you with a student card on your first day of term, or when you register on campus. Flash that card whenever you can - wear it as a badge if you must. Which 2016 student bank account is best? (Photo: Getty) Banks have been falling over themselves to get students to bank with them for decades – offering everything from free mobile phones to railcards and just straight out cash to get students to sign up. While your main focus should be on the longest guaranteed 0% overdraft, the only time this rule doesn’t apply is if the freebie offered is more valuable. This year, the top “gift” is a free four-year 16-25 Railcard that is offered to those who open a Santander 123 account. This usually costs £30 a year and gives you a third off railway tickets. Santander’s overdraft offering is not as big as some of the other banks, but you still get up to £1,500 in the first three years of study, followed by £1,800 in year four and £2,000 in year five. Elsewhere, NatWest is offering a National Express Young Persons card offering a third off coach travel, while HSBC is offering 20 per cent off National Express coach travel, a £60 Amazon gift card and one year of Amazon Prime benefits.

Columbus, Ohio (PRWEB) September 12, 2016 After the successful launch of SellGPU.com, the company quickly turned its sights to the CPU market and is now trading-in CPUs as well as graphics cards. The new tech firm purchases CPUs directly from consumers through a fast, easy-to-use, and zero-risk process. The company is now trading-in CPUs of Intel i3, i5, and i7 models from 6th, 5th, 4th, 3rd and 2nd generations, as well as AMD FX processors. Customers have been receiving trade-in offers of up to $450. “SellGPU is attempting to revolutionize PC upgrade cycles,” Hafez said. “We are trying to bring more value to companies and individuals undergoing an upgrade process.” SellGPU.com, a company of gamers, programmers, and hardware enthusiasts, was established to help organizations and individuals with the need for high-end PC components dispose of their old components. Founder and CEO Said Hafez created the company in late 2014 after finding difficulty in getting rid of an old GPU batch. SellGPU offers its customers instant quotes. After the customer accepts his offer, he or she will have the option to receive a free anti-static foam box and prepaid shipping label with which to send the CPU. The customer then simply places the CPU in the box, tapes the box, affixes the shipping label to it, and drops it off at any local post office. Once the CPU reaches SellGPU, it gets inspected and tested. If it passes the testing process, the customer gets paid by PayPal or check within three business days. If the CPU fails the tests, SellGPU returns it free of charge.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Sep 12, 2016 at 9:48AM Image source: Intel.  A little under two months ago, a leak from generally reliable website PC Watch leaked some details about microprocessor giant Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) late 2017-to-2018 desktop and high-performance notebook processor family, known as Coffee Lake. It's not entirely clear what enhancements Intel is making to Coffee Lake, but PC Watch did mention a couple of key tidbits. First, Coffee Lake is expected to be available in two-, four-, and six-core variants. Current Intel desktop processors only go up to four processor cores. Additionally, Coffee Lake is expected to pack Intel's GT3e graphics, a substantial boost from the GT2 graphics that the company ships in its current desktop processors. Although these tech specs are interesting in their own right, Intel wouldn't add cores and graphics unless it felt there were segments of these markets that found value in increased processor core counts and beefed-up graphics. Here are three areas of the desktop personal computer market that could stand to benefit from these enhancements. Accelerating mini-PCs At Intel's 2015 developer forum, the company hosted a presentation in which it talked up the growing popularity of so-called mini-PCs. According to the presentation, the market for mini-PCs is expected to grow from just shy of 6 million units annually to 8 million units by 2018. The company even said that mini-PCs represented "one of the fastest growing segment[s] in desktops." In the following slide, the company highlighted five different form factors, or types, of mini-PCs: Image source: Intel. The upcoming Coffee Lake chips should be suitable for the Mini-ITX and 5x5 form factors listed. The NUC, Mini Lake, and Compute Stick form factors are typically served by low power mobile chips, not high-performance mobile and desktop processors. Indeed, the amount of computing power that Intel should be able to cram into those two form factors should go up by quite a lot. With six cores and beefier on-chip graphics, the Mini-STX systems should be much more capable of handling gaming workloads than current versions are now, for example. This could make these form factors even more attractive to users who want a lot of performance but couldn't quite handle the sacrifices they'd have to make by using current-generation processors. Beefing up gaming notebook computers Another area where Coffee Lake should shine is in gaming-oriented notebooks. Current gaming notebooks are limited to quad-core processors usually paired with separate graphics processors. Although the quad-core processors that gaming notebook manufacturers include in their systems are quite fast, it is possible to buy gaming desktops with six-, eight-, or even 10-core processors. If there is significant demand from vendors of gaming-oriented laptop makers for six-core processors suitable for their highest-end systems -- and I would imagine that gaming notebook vendors would love that particular marketing point -- then it makes sense that Intel would craft products to serve those vendors' needs. Faster, more efficient all-in-one computers Intel has also talked at length about the growth opportunity in all-in-one desktop computers. The additional processor cores that Coffee Lake is expected to bring to the table should enable a significant performance increase, particularly for productivity workloads, such as video and audio encoding, as well as heavy multi-tasking use cases. Additionally, although standalone graphics processors are possible in all-in-one form factors, particularly the larger screen ones, improved graphics built into the Coffee Lake chips should reduce the need for such standalone chips, enabling cheaper systems that draw less power and generate less heat. How does Intel benefit from this? Intel's job with respect to the personal computer market is twofold. The first is to build chips that enable system vendors to build more attractive products that will ultimately sell well in the market place. More performance is always a nice selling point, especially if it can be delivered in a compact form factor. The next is to add enough value to its chips that system vendors and customers find it worthwhile to buy products higher up in Intel's product stack. Intel may very well be able to charge meaningfully more for a Coffee Lake desktop chip with six processor cores and GT3e graphics than it currently can for a quad-core processor with just GT2 graphics. A boost in average selling prices, especially given that the personal-computer market itself isn't really growing, is a nice way for Intel to shore up its revenue here.

Intel OpenCL Beignet 1.2 Was Quitely Released, No Sign Of OpenCL 2.0 In Sight Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 12 September 2016 at 08:46 AM EDT. 8 Comments Intel China developers quietly announced the release of their open-source Beignet 1.2 OpenCL implementation at the end of August for HD/Iris Graphics hardware. Beignet 1.2 continues supporting OpenCL 1.x while sadly their experimental OpenCL 2.0 branch hasn't been touched now in three months. New to Beignet 1.2 is support for Kabylake and Broxton hardware. Beignet 1.2 also adds support for LLVM 3.7~3.8, adds Assembly debugging and profiling information, experimental double data type support for Broadwell and newer, cl_intel_subgroups extension support, OpenCL 2 workgroup built-in functions, an Android build, and various optimizations and bug-fixes. It is a hearty release with the Broxton/Kabylake support, some new extensions, optimizations, and the Android build will please some users running Android on newer Intel hardware. However, it's sad that there still isn't any complete OpenCL 2.0 support. The OCL20 branch hasn't been touched now since early June. Unfortunately I haven't heard any indication from Intel about what their plans or road-map for supporting open-source OpenCL 2.0 on Linux is about, but hopefully we'll hear (or see) something soon. More details on Beignet 1.2 can be found via 01.org. 8 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience. Michael has written more than 10,000 articles covering the state of Linux hardware support, Linux performance, graphics drivers, and other topics.

If the deal was made, it would shoot itself in the foot Ericsson strikes partnerships with Intel and Google for pay TV Ericsson said at IBC this week that it will partner Google to allow Android TV set tops to work with its MediaFirst TV Platform. It will also partner Intel to look for ways of bringing video processing more efficiently to the cloud. It has been re-engineering Microsoft’s Mediaroom since it acquired it three years ago, and many operator partners have felt their multiscreen needs were too urgent to wait around for the MediaFirst architecture to fully emerge and have deserted it. The integration of Ericsson MediaFirst TV Platform with Android TV will provide an additional pathway to extend MediaFirst cloud-based TV services, including 4K-UHD live TV channels, video-on-demand, catch-up TV and cloud DVR. When you talk to anyone in the pay TV-Ecosystem they say that they little reason to allow Android TV into it, because it allows a creeping influence of Google into the pay TV operators. But there are pay TV operators that talk differently and there have been some successful implementations around Android TV. The partnership will give operators the opportunity to benefit from Android TV's growing presence on connected TV operating systems, without the need for additional hardware costs. Operators will be able to partner with manufacturers of Android TV devices to deliver new hardware as well as niche OTT programming, or deploy additional applications within the Android operating system. Additionally, the collaboration will enable Ericsson to deliver multiple, flexible, pre-integrated set-tops which sup-port hybrid configurations for TV. In a separate blog and announcement Ericsson also said it would begin a collaboration with Intel which seemed to point more to encoding than anything else, although there was not much detail given. There were hints that Ericsson will perhaps give up its dedicated encoding chips and work with Intel on cloud infrastructure, not only for video processing, but also mobility and cloud infrastructure. Ericsson and Intel research centres will also explore joint innovation around video processing, which to us reads code for the Envivio team will get hints from Intel on how best to lay software encoding onto modern Intel cloud servers. The aim to build a foundation for a cloud-centric media infra-structure using virtualized media applications. Intel has plans to release Intel Xeon processors with integrated FPGAs ton accelerate the performance of a software-defined data centre. Also perhaps the Ericsson encoding chip the AVP4000 or some derivative of it could become one of those FPGAs which plug into Intel chips. That would be a mistake we feel, since the entire thrust of encoding has been to go software only and given new encoders coming down the track in the form of AOMedia, and others, its best to retain the constant flexibility of a software only approach. The two also said the combination of Ericsson’s HDS8000 Hyperscale data centre system and Intel Rack Scale Design will help to transform the media data centre by enabling a disaggregated hardware approach that will dramatically improve efficiency, utilization, automation and total cost of ownership. The potential media use cases for data centre workloads include media processing, media delivery and cloud DVR, enabling TV players to build trust in their service delivery while embracing new technologies at the same time. Ericsson and Intel will work together to enable agile service delivery, giving media players the opportunity to drive organisational flexibility and bring new and compelling services to market. For instance, Ericsson’s MediaFirst TV Platform and its native cloud and SaaS approach already leverage DevOps models for continuous development and deployment in live systems. Ericsson is adopting virtualized micro-service based applications in all of its solutions to give complete flexibility to deployment and operational models. Moving beyond the media experiences, Ericsson and Intel are already working together to accelerate the development of 5G-ready networks.

Gregory Doran, the RSC’s artistic director, was overwhelmed by an extraordinary flying whale in a three-minute corporate video by Intel Corporation. The footage is spectacular. The whale swims across three juxtaposed cinema screens before emerging through one of them and swimming over hundreds of people in an auditorium. Referring to the technology, rather than the whale, Doran told colleagues: “That’s what I want for The Tempest.” Sounds and sweet airs: The Tempest's seductive musical sorcery Read more They contacted Intel, who were excited by the challenge of extending technology developed for film and video to live theatre. In November, the shipwreck, storms and fantastical creatures of Shakespeare’s late play will be brought to life with what promises to be spectacular special effects. Rehearsals begin on Monday. The production stars Simon Russell Beale as Prospero, the magician, and Mark Quartley as Ariel, the sprite, who will be transformed through real-time performance capture technology into a “live” animated character in the RSC Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon. Quartley will be on stage, wearing sensors that capture his movements, projecting them into the air and rendering him as a character that morphs in and out of a human form. Doran told the Guardian: “You will see an avatar of Ariel in real time, flying, walking and moving in the middle space, in the air. It will be projected on to a whole number of things. “I’m amazed just how fast technology advances. There’s even been, since we started this venture [a year ago], a new kind of glass that’s been invented that you can’t see. So there are all sorts of things that you can project on to.” The production combines the RSC’s traditional theatre-making skills and Intel’s digital innovation with the technical imagination of the Imaginarium Studios, in London, in pushing boundaries. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Gregory Doran on the technology in his new production of The Tempest Technological experiments will take place this week. The hope is that when Prospero conjures up a magical storm to wreck the ship carrying men who wronged him projected images on multiple surfaces will also make the audience feel as though they are in the ship as it starts filling with water. Actors will appear to be thrown into the air by crashing, swirling waves. Doran said: “There’s all the computer-generated extraordinary stuff you can do on film. But it has never yet been done live on stage. This is storytelling for the 21st century, taking the audience’s imagination into new realms. “We would be Luddites not to open ourselves to those possibilities.” Sarah Ellis, the RSC’s head of digital development, said: “To be able to create digital characters in real time on that scale in a theatrical environment is a huge achievement.” But Doran is keen to emphasise “the primacy of the words”. “The effects mustn’t overwhelm them … It’s got to enhance rather than dictate what we’re doing.” Tawny Schlieski, Intel’s director of research, said that the potential for live theatre is huge: “It’s not about being new for new’s sake. It’s about creating that moment in which you’re immersed in a world and you don’t think about why or how. You just become lost in it. That’s something magical.” They were speaking ahead of an announcement on Monday of the RSC’s spring/summer 2017 season. From Stratford to Shanghai: the Royal Shakespeare Company tours China Read more The programme will pay tribute to the Roman poet Ovid, a major influence on Shakespeare. A new Rome season of Shakespeare’s four great political thrillers will begin with Julius Caesar, with its somewhat topical “politics of spin and betrayal”, followed by Antony and Cleopatra, Titus Andronicus and Coriolanus. World premieres will include a co-production – with Hull Truck theatre and Hull City of Culture 2017 – of The Hypocrite by the award-winning playwright Richard Bean. It is described as a “riotous farce about the infamous moment in Hull’s history which started the English civil war”. Another first is a staging of a story of social injustice from 13th-century Yuan dynasty China. Guan Hanqing’s Snow in Midsummer – in a contemporary translation by the playwright Frances Ya-Chu Cowhig – tells the story of a young girl framed for a crime she did not commit. It is part of a cultural exchange with China. The Shanghai Dramatic Arts Centre will in turn produce Henry V with a Chinese cast under RSC associate director Owen Horsley. Whether new technology will feature in the 2017 season remains to be seen.

Presented in collaboration with MyGov, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeITY) and Hyderabad-based T-Hub Foundation, this year's challenge invites innovators makers across India to build solutions to accelerate the digitisation and commercially develop their prototypes on Intel Architecture (iA). "It is heartening to see public-private collaborations, such as the one between Intel India, MeITY, MyGov and T-Hub, driven towards building a long-term innovation culture in the nation," said Telangana Information and Technology Minister K.T. Rama Rao. This year, the challenge will roll out in five phases, with the final taking place in April 2017. Shortlisted teams will receive Rs 3 lakh grant each to create minimum-viable products (MVPs) based on Intel Architecture (iA) in an accelerator programme at the T-Hub incubator in Hyderabad. The winning team will get Rs 20 lakh to further their project development. "Last year, there were six ideas under the challenge that completed the mind-to-market journey, and are already making their solutions available in the Indian health care and agriculture sectors," added Gaurav Dwivedi, CEO, MyGov. The Intel India initiative aims to enable technology innovation in the country for students, entrepreneurs and other innovators. "Innovation is the key ingredient for making the Digital India vision a reality, and we need a local, sustainable innovation ecosystem, to address the country's challenges," said Debjani Ghosh, Managing Director and Vice President (Sales iamp; Marketing), Intel South Asia. "Through strong public-private collaboration, wherein MeITY, MyGov, T-Hub, and Intel India are working together to turn ideas to solutions, disruptive yet sustainable technology innovations are now a reality," she added. In its recent collaboration with NITI Aayog, Intel India is working to establish Atal Tinkering Laboratories (ATLs) for "mini makers" in 10 schools across the country. na/dg Previous News Next News News Categories World India Business Sports Bollywood Hollywood Kerala Education Health Technology Automobile Travel Computer Features BEST OF NK News Maps Travel India Info Games Education Self Help Recipes Names Astrology © Copyright 2016.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Sep 11, 2016 at 12:43PM Image source: Micron.  No company, not even one that is incredibly well managed and participates in secular growth trends, is immune to risks. Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), the world's largest semiconductor company by revenue, is no exception. In this column, I'd like to highlight three potential risks that investors in this chip giant should be aware of. 1. Intel's fortunes remain tied to the personal computer market Although Intel has done a good job of trying to find growth beyond the personal computer market -- a market that's proven challenging over the years -- the fact of the matter is that this segment still represents a substantial portion of the company's revenue, operating profit, and manufacturing scale. Indeed, last year Intel took in $55.35 billion in revenue. Of that hefty sum, $32.219 billion came from the company's client computing group, which primarily sells components that go into personal computers. This segment also contributed $8.165 billion in operating profit, making it the largest profit machine among the company's business units. If the personal computer market manages to decline slightly, stay flat, or even grow, then Intel's other businesses -- if they grow as expected -- should be more than enough to pick up the slack and help the company achieve some level of revenue growth. However, if the personal computer market drops significantly in a given year, then not only do the prospects of revenue growth dim, but it could have a significant impact on overall profitability. 2. Intel's data center group is about to face significant competition Intel's data center group has benefited from both secular growth trends as well as the fact that it has dominant share of the market for server processors. To be clear, Intel's market share hasn't come by accident -- the company has invested significantly over many years to build best-in-class chips and other technologies in order to grow that share. However, since Intel now overwhelmingly dominates the server processor market, the opportunity to grow its share is limited (though there are non-server opportunities in the data center that Intel is gaining share in). And, naturally, there are many companies vying for a piece of Intel's very lucrative server processor pie. If Intel can maintain significant competitive advantages over its competition, then it should be able to continue to grow with the server market (since Intel's share is high enough that it is virtually the server chip market). However, if Intel loses market share, then that could have a negative impact on its growth rate here. This is something that Intel investors should keep a close eye on. 3. Intel's bet on memory may not pay off Last year, Intel announced that it would be significantly growing its bet on non-volatile memory technologies such as 3D NAND and a new technology that it developed in conjunction with memory maker Micron (NASDAQ:MU) known as 3DXPoint that's supposed to be much faster than typical NAND flash memory and can be used as both storage and main memory. In particular, Intel said that it plans to spend $1.5 billion this year on capital equipment to refit its chip manufacturing plant in Dalian, China, to manufacture both 3D NAND and 3DXPoint. It's also likely that will continue to invest in both capital equipment as well as research and development in support of 3D NAND and 3DXPoint in the future. If Intel can build competitive products at a leadership cost structure, then it should be able to successfully play in this market. However, if the company's technology winds up falling behind and it is placed at a major cost structure disadvantage, then it might continue to incur significant losses. Right now, the business is losing money but Intel is banking on turning it profitable down the line.   Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool recommends Intel.

The post, first spotted by Ashraf Eassa from fool.com, said the products in question would arrive in the “2020 and beyond” timeframe. Eassa recently noticed, however, that Intel has published a revised version of the job listing that suggests Intel may be looking to milk its upcoming 10nm process longer than most initially expected. In the updated listing, Intel says it is looking for someone to spearhead the research and advanced development of microprocessor cores in the 2022 and beyond timeframe. The microarchitecture and design of these advanced CPUs, the company says, will be aggressively co-optimized with Intel's sub-10nm technology nodes deep into the next decade. On the surface, it indeed sounds like Intel may be pushing its 7nm chips out by a couple of years, from 2020 to 2022. As Eassa notes, it’s possible that Intel could instead be talking about 5nm technology in the new listing versus the 7nm it explicitly referenced in the original posting. If that were the case, it seems unlikely that Intel would use the phrase “sub-10nm technology nodes” rather than something more fitting like “sub-7nm technology nodes.” Related Reads Intel tells John McAfee he can't use his own name Early Intel Core M benchmarks look very impressive Intel Z170 vs. Z97 chipset: What is the difference? 9 comments 160 interactions Share this article: Now Read This… China still has the two fastest supercomputers in the world The indefatigable PC IBM says Macs save as much as $543 per user versus a PC Popular 33 comments Make Chrome great again: Performance and memory tweaks Samsung SSD 960 Evo 500GB Review: The king of the TLC hill Load Comments 9 ...

No single company is perfect, but together they show what the corporate ideal could look like. The platonic ideal “We are at our best when we draw on the talents of all parts of our society, and our greatest accomplishments are achieved when diverse perspectives are brought to bear to overcome our greatest challenges.” —Barack Obama in 2011 The practice Genevieve Bell, who’s been at Intel since 1998, was running late for her call, so she quickly ducked into the gender-neutral bathroom at the company’s Santa Clara, California, headquarters before plopping herself down on the floor to dial in. “Intel today feels like a profoundly different company than I was at even five years ago,” says Bell, a cultural anthropologist, senior fellow, and vice president at Intel.  “I had at least one boss who told me my career would be much better if I stopped talking about diversity. I survived, and he didn’t.”  These days, it seems almost every major tech company in Silicon Valley has publicly committed to building a more diverse workforce. But it’s a topic Bell, a self-described radical feminist, has been thinking about since she first arrived at the company 18 years ago. “I had at least one boss who told me my career would be much better if I stopped talking about diversity,” says Bell. She was one of the first social scientists hired by Intel to conduct field work to understand what women and people in the “rest of world” (a term she hates) want from technology. “I survived, and he didn’t.” Like its peers, Intel is overwhelmingly male, white, and Asian, and the diversity problem is a particularly tough one to tackle because 85% of its 100,000 or so employees are in technical roles, which is where the industry’s efforts to improve diversity have largely stalled. “They really have to make a dent on the technical side,” says Elizabeth Ames, a senior vice president at the Anita Borg Institute, which advocates on behalf of women in technology. “I think it’s really impressive that Intel is not only making this dent, but they are continuing to sustain it.” Since 2000, long before companies like Google and Facebook began releasing their diversity stats, Intel made its EEO-1 reports, which are filed with the US government and break down staff race and gender across all ranks, publicly available. Transparency was a good first step, and key to holding the company accountable, but it alone wasn’t enough. To show it was really committed to the cause, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich went on stage at the 2015 International Consumer Electronics Show (CES), arguably the biggest tech convention of the year, to proclaim the company would reach full representation—meaning the makeup of its staff would mirror market availability across different types of roles—by 2020. This aspiration might seem basic, but it’s rare for a tech company to set specific, measurable goals. While full representation is also a realistic goal, it’s proved largely out of reach for the tech industry. According to Intel’s market availability data, women make up 22.7% of available talent for technical roles while Hispanics and African Americans comprise 8.4% and 4.5%, respectively. At Facebook and Alphabet, Google’s parent company, for example, Hispanics and blacks make up 3% and 1%, respectively, of technical roles. Women comprise 17% of tech staff at Facebook and 19% at Alphabet. “It’s time to step up and do more,” Krzanich declared in his keynote address. “It’s not good enough to say we value diversity.” He said Intel would commit $300 million to invest in startups created by women and underrepresented minorities, help define computer science curriculum at high schools, offer internships to diverse students, and send Intel employees to schools to mentor minority students.  “It’s time to step up and do more.”  This was in addition to Intel’s other initiatives to recruit, retain, and promote diverse employees. This year the company started requiring managers to interview a diverse slate of candidates for open roles, and for a diverse group of employees to interview job candidates. The company doesn’t mandate specific quotas, but continues to emphasize diversity with hiring managers and will enlist the help of recruiters to fill these slates too. Intel also runs a “pay it forward” program that identifies and connects promising employees with mentors within the company who help groom them into leaders. “I’m a product of the sponsorship protege program,” says Sandra Lopez, vice president of Intel’s new devices group and member of Intel’s Hispanic Leadership Council. “I had a sponsor, and she helped me understand what I needed to do to be a leader and grow and develop. As a result, I became a VP.” It’s a common refrain for tech companies to attribute their lack of diversity to the “pipeline problem,” the notion that there aren’t enough qualified women and minorities to recruit from. Intel, however, believes it can approach the diversity problem from a variety of angles, including keeping its existing employees. “I always say if you just focus on hiring and everyone’s [headed] toward the door, it’s a zero-sum game,” remarks Danielle Brown, Intel’s chief diversity and inclusion officer. To retain its employees, Intel has worked to build a welcoming work environment, one where employees feel there are opportunities to grow their careers. One attempt to do so is a program called Rapid Orientation for Accelerated Results (ROAR), which brings new hires to headquarters for a week to meet with company leaders and attend workshops on career development. Intel believes there’s a ripple effect in promoting diverse employees to managerial roles, who are likely to attract, hire, and mentor other women and underrepresented minorities. A company blog post on Intel’s internal blog. (Intel) “I think we’re all impatient for change to happen quickly.”  When the company first started the program in 2015, it was available only to women. But this year, Intel opened ROAR to diverse hires, which Brown says is key to achieving Intel’s diversity goals. “If we made the choice to be exclusive instead of inclusive, it wouldn’t be received very well,” she adds. “We truly believe for this to work you have to take the inclusive approach.” This same approach has been taken with other initiatives as well, tested first with a smaller group, such as new hires within the last year, before opening it up to more employees. The takeaways While progress is slow, according to Intel’s most recent diversity report released Aug. 10, women now make up 25% of the company’s US employees and 21% of technical staff in the US. In addition, underrepresented minorities comprise 12% of its US employees and technical employees. In the first half of 2016, however, Intel saw a slight decline in the percentage of women and underrepresented minorities in their early careers. The company explains this is a result of a shift in focus from PCs to the cloud and connected devices, which led to fluctuations in its hiring numbers and increases in people leaving the company. But the company insists it’s still committed to its goal of full representation by 2020. In Silicon Valley, where cars drive themselves and marijuana shows up an hour after it’s ordered, diversity has proven to be a problem with no easy solution. Intel knows there’s more than just the pipeline problem, which it’s committed to fixing. To grow and maintain diversity, it’s also working to keep existing staff happy and getting all employees—not just the underrepresented—on board with the company’s goals. “This is big, big culture change,” says Brown. “It’s really changing the way a company practices hiring, how they think about internal movement and development, how they think about retention. Those changes take time, and I think we’re all impatient for change to happen quickly.” Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search
Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile iPhone 7 & iPhone 7 Plus Feature Intel’s Modems Creating New Versions For Device By Ramish Zafar Posted 2 months ago 16Shares Share Tweet Submit The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus launched this year came with their fair share of controversy. Apple tried its best to make us forget that it hasn’t changed the design on its flagships for three years. While the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus did feature build upgrades, they devices maintained the spaceship form of their predecessors. The only new feature which Apple introduced was the dual camera for the larger iPhone 7 Plus. The removal of the 3.5mm earphone jack didn’t win Apple any new fans either. Almost all of these features had also surfaced on the rumor mill months before the launch of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Another rumor also claimed that Intel’s modems would be making it on the devices this year. Intel’s Modems On The iPhone 7 And iPhone 7 Plus Restrict Compatibility Of Some Models To T-Mobile And AT&T Supplier issues are a problem that Apple’s faced on the iPhone for quite a while. The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus suffered from GT Technologies’ bankruptcy. This forced Apple to stick with Corning’s Gorilla Glass on the devices. The inability of Apple to upgrade the iPhone’s display from IPS LCD to OLED or Micro-OLED is partly due to supplier problems as well. While we’ve started to see the collaboration between Foxconn and SHARP solidify, there’s still time until it bears actual fruit. To that end, the news that Apple would use Intel’s modems in the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus wasn’t that much of a surprise either. For starters, the news had been surfacing for quite a while and secondly, Apple loves to diversify its supplier base without affecting performance whenever possible. To that end, we’re now starting to hear that Intel’s modems have made it on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus after all. What’s more, they’ve limited the pair’s carrier connectivity as well. Advertisement The decision to use Intel’s modems on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus has restricted their carrier connectivity. Santa Clara’s modems don’t support the old CDMA Standard which is employed by Sprint and Verizon. Therefore, if you’ve ordered an iPhone from either of the carriers, it’ll feature Qualcomm’s modems. If you’ve ordered one from T-Mobile or AT&T, then you’ll get a device with Intel’s modem. Of course, Apple hasn’t fully diversified yet. T-Mobile and AT&T iPhones feature Qualcomm’s modems as well. With these restrictions, users might find themselves bound to one carrier over the life of their device. This will create problems for a lot of folks out there, even though carrier switches aren’t that common in the US. Nevertheless, if you haven’t pre-ordered an iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus for yourself, do consider today’s information before making your decision and carrier choice. If you’ve ordered one, then we hope we were of help in making things clear for you. Thoughts? Let us now what you think in the comments section below and stay tuned for the latest.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Sep 11, 2016 at 12:43PM Image source: Micron.  No company, not even one that is incredibly well managed and participates in secular growth trends, is immune to risks. Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), the world's largest semiconductor company by revenue, is no exception. In this column, I'd like to highlight three potential risks that investors in this chip giant should be aware of. 1. Intel's fortunes remain tied to the personal computer market Although Intel has done a good job of trying to find growth beyond the personal computer market -- a market that's proven challenging over the years -- the fact of the matter is that this segment still represents a substantial portion of the company's revenue, operating profit, and manufacturing scale. Indeed, last year Intel took in $55.35 billion in revenue. Of that hefty sum, $32.219 billion came from the company's client computing group, which primarily sells components that go into personal computers. This segment also contributed $8.165 billion in operating profit, making it the largest profit machine among the company's business units. If the personal computer market manages to decline slightly, stay flat, or even grow, then Intel's other businesses -- if they grow as expected -- should be more than enough to pick up the slack and help the company achieve some level of revenue growth. However, if the personal computer market drops significantly in a given year, then not only do the prospects of revenue growth dim, but it could have a significant impact on overall profitability. 2. Intel's data center group is about to face significant competition Intel's data center group has benefited from both secular growth trends as well as the fact that it has dominant share of the market for server processors. To be clear, Intel's market share hasn't come by accident -- the company has invested significantly over many years to build best-in-class chips and other technologies in order to grow that share. However, since Intel now overwhelmingly dominates the server processor market, the opportunity to grow its share is limited (though there are non-server opportunities in the data center that Intel is gaining share in). And, naturally, there are many companies vying for a piece of Intel's very lucrative server processor pie. If Intel can maintain significant competitive advantages over its competition, then it should be able to continue to grow with the server market (since Intel's share is high enough that it is virtually the server chip market). However, if Intel loses market share, then that could have a negative impact on its growth rate here. This is something that Intel investors should keep a close eye on. 3. Intel's bet on memory may not pay off Last year, Intel announced that it would be significantly growing its bet on non-volatile memory technologies such as 3D NAND and a new technology that it developed in conjunction with memory maker Micron (NASDAQ:MU) known as 3DXPoint that's supposed to be much faster than typical NAND flash memory and can be used as both storage and main memory. In particular, Intel said that it plans to spend $1.5 billion this year on capital equipment to refit its chip manufacturing plant in Dalian, China, to manufacture both 3D NAND and 3DXPoint. It's also likely that will continue to invest in both capital equipment as well as research and development in support of 3D NAND and 3DXPoint in the future. If Intel can build competitive products at a leadership cost structure, then it should be able to successfully play in this market. However, if the company's technology winds up falling behind and it is placed at a major cost structure disadvantage, then it might continue to incur significant losses. Right now, the business is losing money but Intel is banking on turning it profitable down the line.   Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool recommends Intel.

By: Steven Bassiri | Gaming Laptops in Laptops | Posted: Sep 12, 2016 10:10 pm Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA TweakTown Rating: 92%Manufacturer: ASUS Page 1 [Introduction, Specifications, and Pricing] Page 1 [Introduction, Specifications, and Pricing] Page 2 [Physical Overview] Page 3 [Physical Overview Continued] Page 4 [Software and BIOS] Page 5 [System Performance Benchmarks] Page 6 [Gaming Performance Benchmarks] Page 7 [System IO and Battery Performance] Page 8 [Thermal Performance] Page 9 [What's Hot, What's Not & Final Thoughts] Introduction     At Skylake launch, Intel introduced two new mobile processor lines; mobile Xeons and overclockable mobile processors. Today, I take a look at ASUS's G701 gaming notebook equipped with an overclockable mobile Core i7 CPU, the i7 6820HK. Now, for a notebook to be considered a gaming product, it must also carry a discrete graphics processor. In the case of the G701, a NVIDIA GTX 980M is used. While it is true that the 980M is no longer king since the launch of the GTX 1000 series mobile graphics processors, this notebook is still very capable of rendering high frame rates at a slightly lower cost since the GTX 980M is no longer NVIDIA's most powerful mobile GPU.     The G701 is a 17" notebook, and while I have reviewed a lot of 17" notebooks, this is the first one that uses an FHD (1920x1080) panel instead of a UHD (3840x2160) panel. While some might consider that a negative, I do not consider it as a weakness. In fact, a 17" panel is not that big, and 1080p is more than enough pixels to produce a worthwhile gaming experience. The G701 I am looking at today is equipped with a 1TB RAID 0 array based on two 512GB Samsung SM951 M.2 x4 PCI-E 3.0 SSDs. The super-fast storage coupled with the overclockable mobile processor and high-end mobile gaming GPU should produce a very powerful mobile gaming system. Let's take a look.     Specifications     Like most notebooks, the G701 comes in many different configurations. However, they will all use the i7-6820HK processor with 4 cores and 8 threads. The processor runs at 2.7GHz base frequency with a 3.6GHz Turbo, and 3.8GHz if you overclock it. Our unit uses a GTX 980M with 8GB of VRAM, two 512GB Samsung SM951 M.2 SSDs in RAID 0, and an Intel dual-band Wireless-AC 7265 Wireless AC and Bluetooth card. The panel is a 17.3" LED FHD (1920 x 1080) anti-glare panel with 72% NTSC with wide view technology. The notebook is a little heavy at 7.9lbs. It's also not small at 17x12x13" (WxDxH).     The CPUz screens show our unit with an overclock. The overclock was configured through ASUS's software in Windows and applied upon reboot. Our G701 has an immense 64GB of DDR4 running at 2400MHz. The unit also has Thunderbolt 3, a refined audio DAC, and a 6-cell 93 Whrs battery. To power all of this, ASUS provides a 230W power adapter.     Pricing   The G701 comes in many different forms; ours costs roughly $3200. The price should drop as the GTX 1000M series mobile GPUs become more widespread.

InFocus MondoPad 70-inch all-in-one has Intel's Skylake processors and is designed for collaboration and videoconferencing. Credit: InFocus More like this Microsoft spices up Surface Hub with Azure cloud services Microsoft and IBM in a deal to push Surface devices to enterprises Review: 4 mini-PCs give you full power in a very small package Video Mingis on Tech: From superfast SSDs to Bluetooth locks and solar shingles Competition is good, and InFocus' huge MondoPad Ultra all-in-one PC highlights some shortcomings in Microsoft's Surface Hub touchscreen computers. MondoPad and Surface Hub lead a unique class of all-in-one computers with large screens that are being used in classrooms and conference rooms for video conferencing, collaboration and whiteboarding.  The MondoPad Ultra is a computer built into a 70-inch screen. At $13,999, its price sits between Microsoft's two Surface Hubs, the $8,999 55-inch model and the $21,999 84-inch model. InFocus believes the MondoPad Ultra provides more bang for the buck than Surface Hub. The MondoPad has a 4K screen, which is also featured in the 84-inch Surface Hub. The 55-inch Surface Hub has a full HD screen. Some features give the MondoPad Ultra a performance advantage. It has a 6th Generation Intel Core i7-6700T processor code-named Skylake, which is much faster than the Surface Hubs' aging 4th Generation Intel processors code-named Haswell, introduced in 2013. With new processors come faster processing power and better graphics. InFocus didn't immediately reveal if MondoPad Ultra had a discrete GPU. The 55-inch Surface Hub has integrated Intel Haswell graphics, and the 84-inch model has Nvidia's Quadro K2200 discrete GPU, which is about two years old. InFocus' MondoPad has 256GB of storage, double that of Surface Hub. Both computers have 8GB of memory. There's no significant difference between the MondoPad and Surface Hub on display ports, USB and connectivity features. Microsoft didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on whether it plans to upgrade the Surface Hub, which started shipping earlier this year. But the Surface Hub has some inherent advantages over competing devices like MondoPad. In computers like these, multi-touch capabilities matter because they define the number of users who can draw or write on the screen at the same time. The MondoPad has a 16-point touch capability, which doesn't match Surface Hubs' 100-point touch capability. MondoPad comes with Windows 10 Pro, while Microsoft's Surface Hub has a custom version of Windows 10 with unique apps, editing, annotation and collaboration features. Surface Hub ships with Surface Pen styluses, and it is not clear if pens will ship with MondoPad Ultra. InFocus says Apple devices and Chromebooks can project content to the MondoPad Ultra. The MondoPad Ultra 70-inch computer will ship in October. InFocus already offers 80-inch and 85-inch MondoPad Ultra products.

Two Power8 CPUs (silver) are integrated with four Nvidia Tesla P100 Pascal GPUs (copper) via Nvidia's NVLink interconnect (Photo: IBM) Asia-Pacific, Big Data, Blades, Featured, HPC, IBM IBM: Tencent to Run OpenPower Servers in Its Data Centers by Yevgeniy Sverdlik  on September 9, 2016 Add Your Comments Tweet Tencent, China’s answer to Facebook which this week became the country’s most valuable publicly traded company, is integrating new servers powered by OpenPower, IBM’s alternative to Intel’s ubiquitous x86 chip architecture, into its hyperscale data centers. That’s according to IBM. Yesterday, the company rolled out a new OpenPower chip and three new OpenPower servers, including the one being deployed at Tencent data centers to run Big Data workloads. OpenPower is at the center of IBM’s current server play, focused on high-horsepower workloads as opposed to the general-purpose x86 market the company got out of in 2014 when it sold its commodity server business to Lenovo. OpenPower is a chip architecture developed through a foundation whose members include Google, Nvidia, and Broadcom, among many others. Unlike x86, which Intel keeps exclusive to itself, IBM licenses OpenPower to other companies wishing to build chips using the architecture. Tencent, according to IBM, recently tested a large cluster of its new servers, finding that they performed three times faster than the x86-based infrastructure it had in place, with fewer servers. The announcement didn’t specify, however, what kind of x86 servers the cluster was compared to and how old they were. The results were convincing enough for Tencent to go ahead with a production deployment of the IBM servers, but it’s unclear how big that deployment will be. According to IBM, the Chinese company is “integrating the new servers into its hyperscale data centers for big data workloads.” Social networking giant Tencent drives revenue growth through advertising and gaming on its messaging apps WeChat and QQ. On Monday, when its shares rose 4.2 percent, the company’s market value reached $256.6 billion, surpassing China Mobile as the most valuable company in China and joining the likes of Apple and Alphabet on the list of 10 largest public companies in the world. If the scale of Tencent’s deployment is significant, it should be concerning for Intel, whose x86 architecture has dominated the data center market for years with little trouble from challengers. Other two hyperscale data center operators, Google and Rackspace, have been co-designing a server based on IBM’s Power9 CPU, with plans to open source the server architecture through the Open Compute Project. Founded by Facebook, OCP has become the primary hub for open source hardware design for hyperscale data centers. IBM announced Power9 last month, but systems based on these 14nm chips are not expected to ship until sometime in 2017. Internet giants like Tencent, Google, and Facebook, which operate some of the world’s largest data centers, are now the primary growth drivers for suppliers in the data center hardware food chain, and emergence of a serious challenger to Intel in this space would threaten to slow the chip giant’s future revenue gains. And OpenPower isn’t the only challenger that’s gathering up steam. At the high end of the data center market, Intel is also being challenged by Nvidia. Much of the computing might in IBM’s new Linux servers comes from integration with Nvidia GPUs, working in tandem with OpenPower CPUs as accelerators. The most powerful of the three new models comes with the GPU maker’s latest and greatest interconnect technology, NVLink, which links the new Power8 processor to Tesla P100 Pascal GPUs. Bill Boday, IBM’s senior offering manager for Linux on Power, said Power8 is the “first CPU designed for acceleration,” meaning acceleration via GPUs, while NVLink provides five times the bandwidth of PCIe interconnects. Nvidia’s latest Pascal processors also power its first supercomputer, DGX-1. The chipmaker recently gifted a DGX-1 system to OpenAI, the artificial-intelligence research non-profit founded by Elon Musk. Read more: Why Nvidia Gave Elon Musk’s AI Non-Profit a Supercomputer The IBM system with NVLink is S822LC for High Performance Computing. It has two Power8 CPUs, tightly integrated with four Tesla P100 GPUs via NVLink. The other two systems (S822LC for Big Data and S821C) are compatible with Nvidia GPUs but interconnection with CPUs is done via PCIe ports. Intel’s answer to high-octane, GPU-accelerated computing is Xeon Phi. The next-gen part in this line (Knights Mill) – its first designed specifically with machine learning in mind – is expected to ship next year.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive A $130 billion Wall Street investor is trying to muscle in on Silicon Valley Sunday Sep 11, 2016 at 12:03 PM Rachel Butt Nigel Treblin/Reuters KKR, the private equity dealmaker that inspired Barbarians at the Gate, has a new love. The company's executives are wooing early stage startups in the US, Europe and Israel, targeting those in the corporate enterprise, fintech and artificial intelligence industries. "We're trying to invest in situations where the companies have an established product, market and technology," Philipp Freise, head of technology, media and telecoms in Europe at KKR, told Business Insider. "They have revenue and a clear path to scalability, but still are at the stage where valuations are reasonable." KKR, with buyout roots dating back to 1976, has evolved into a $131 billion firm that has a hedge fund unit, invests in infrastructure projects, and lends to distressed companies. It is now raising a "growth equity" fund dedicated to private tech investments. Private equity's infatuation with tech has spurred a flurry of deals this year. Apollo Global, for example, recently agreed a deal to take cloud computing firm Rackspace private in a $4.3 billion deal. Thomas Bravo said it will buy data analytics firm Qlik Technologies for $3 billion. And private-equity company TPG and Intel are jointly spinning out Intel Security in a deal that values the business at $4.2 billion. "It's really an indication of the maturing tech PE ecosystem," Todson Page, PwC’s US technology deals leader, told Business Insider. "These funds are getting more comfortable with what the risks are, have a better appreciation of industry trends, and get a better sense of where the disruptions are as they have companies in their portfolios." 'More than capital' Before forming the fund, KKR invested in tech deals from its balance sheet, Scott Nuttall, global head of capital and asset management at KKR, said on the company's first quarter earnings call. "Several warehoused balance sheet investments will be transferred into the fund, again illustrating the power of our balance sheet to accelerate fundraising," Nuttall said.  Over the past year, the firm has invested in everything ranging from train tickets platform Trainline to cyber security firm Darktrace. A spokeswoman at KKR has declined to comment on the fundraising progress. With more than 100 portfolio companies that have over $5 billion in annual IT spending, KKR can effectively be a matchmaker, introducing companies that have a need with other portfolio companies that can meet it. For example, Frankfurt-based firm Arago, which developed an algorithm that aims to free up time for engineers, gained early traction in Europe. It broke into the US market after KKR introduced it to portfolio company First Data. When other portfolio companies were struggling with security issues, KKR introduced them to identity management provider Ping Identity. KKR invested in Ping in 2014, with the firm's annual recurring revenue growing sharply thereafter. Vista Equity Partners acquired Ping earlier this year.  In short, KKR can offer more than capital, according to Freise, who cited the company's global network of offices, portfolio companies, and hands-on support to help scale the startups. Moonshot...or not KKR's growth equity team keeps a close eye on startups and on the venture capital scene.  "We can do anything under $100 million, but $40 million to $60 million per investment is the sweet spot," Freise said. "We don't take risk for the product– it has to demonstrate it can be scaled and bring revenue." Aside from working directly with enterpreneurs, KKR also partners with venture capital firms like Highland Capital Partners. Often times, these VCs need good follow-on investors to take the startup to the next level, Friese added. When asked whether KKR is making a good move, Chris Kotowski, managing director and banks analyst at Oppenheimer & Co., said the jury is out.  "In VCs, you tend to have much smaller equity checks, and the thing is in PE, you're not looking for the 10 to 1 shot. You hope to get twice your money in 5 years for most of your investments, and you can't afford a lot of complete failures," Kotowski said. "It's probably a fairly small business [for KKR], but it's kind of a natural extension. We'll see what good will come out of it."

Samsung Electronics saw its share in the global SSD market reach 37.3 percent in the first quarter of the year, compared with 32.8 percent from the same period last year, according to the data compiled by industry tracker IHS. Samsung Electronics is trailed by Intel Corp. with 12.2 percent and SanDisk Corp. with 11 percent. U.S. memory chipmaker Micron Technology came in a distant fourth with 3.9 percent, and Japan's Toshiba Corp. has a 3.8 percent share in the global SSD market. An SSD is a data storage device made with a NAND flash memory chip that saves data without requiring power, and is more durable and faster than a hard disk drive (HDD). Global market research firm TrendForce said that the ratio of SSDs installed in laptop computers could exceed 50 percent in 2018, compared with more than 30 percent this year. SSD prices have fallen gradually while hard drive prices remain at relatively high levels. The market price of 128GB SSDs will soon be cheaper than 500GB HDDs, and the price between 256GB SSDs and 1TB HDDs is less than US$5. entropy@yna.co.kr (END) Most Viewed Seoul to ban smoking at cultural asset sites (4th LD) Park apologizes over alleged sexual misconduct by ex-spokesman Ssangyong says resumption of overnight shift turning point of normalization (2nd LD) N.

A pioneer of so-called “moment marketing,” TVTY has developed a platform that lets advertisers instantly launch digital marketing campaigns triggered by offline events such as TV shows or commercials, sports events and changes in the weather. It is used by both brands and agencies in more than 40 different countries worldwide, including Sony, Intel, Tesco, O2, GSK, Volkswagen and Nationwide. “It’s more important than ever for brands to be ‘in the moment’ when it comes to their marketing message if they want to cut through the noise, be relevant and optimize their media spend,” says Eliott Reilhac, TVTY CEO in EMEA. “That means delivering powerful messages in real time, that connect with people at the key moments when they reach for their smartphone or tablet to check the web or interact on social media. The problem for brands is how to do this at scale, in an automated fashion and in an ever evolving digital landscape.” To that end, Reilhac says TVTY’s proprietary technology monitors and reacts to more triggers than any other platform on the market (over one million, apparently), such as weather, sports, financial, health, TV ads and pollution. These are thought to be key moments when consumers turn to their devices to go online for more information in which they can also be bombarded with ads relevant to that moment. In addition, the startup’s “Universal Trigger” product lets brands use any public or private data feed to launch what the startup describes as “hyper-targeted moment marketing campaigns.” Examples of these types of data-driven triggers include real-time flight information, stock levels, box-office sales or public transport delays and can be as granular as required. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase TVTY Founded 2009 Overview TVTY enables agencies to optimize the timing of their digital campaigns to fit in the context.

Virtual reality headsets like Intel's Project Alloy and Qualcomm's Snapdragon VR have oodles of sensors and powerful but efficient processors that promise an immersive VR experience without being tethered to a PC. But they're months, if not years, away from commercial availability. If you want that experience now (or as soon as possible), you might consider pairing a current high-end headset with MSI's VR One, a PC in a backpack. It weighs eight pounds, has 90 minutes of battery life, and packs an overclocked Intel Core i7 and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 graphics card. The VR One was born from a concept that MSI announced earlier this year at Computex. It's designed to solve two problems at once: many consumer desktops aren't powerful enough to support an HTC Vive or Oculus Rift, and of the ones that are, many are immense gaming PCs. //Related Articles MSI Tackles Tethered VR Problem With Backpack PC The VR One resembles the laser tag gear you might have worn as a kid. It's almost entirely black, except for two symmetrical red panels surrounding the MSI logo. The most unique aspect of its design is the battery packs: this backpack uses power-hungry desktop components, so MSI bestowed it with two hot-swappable batteries. Indicator lights on each one show the remaining charge. When it reaches a critical level, you can switch one battery at a time without shutting down the PC or connecting it to external power. The components are air cooled, with two fan blades and nine heat pipes offering efficient but very quiet air circulation. MSI says noise output will be less than 41 dba, about standard for a desktop. As for compatibility, the VR One was developed in partnership with HTC, so it will include support for the Vive out of the box, though it should also run competing headsets like the Rift. The company will announce the backpack's pricing and ship date at the Tokyo Game Show later this week.

While the game’s minimum system requirements are fairly tame, players may need to invest in an upgraded GPU to get the most out of their trip to New Bordeaux. Related: 2K’s Mafia III will hit consoles and PCs in October Similar to Rockstar’s Grand Theft Auto series, 2K’s Mafia III features a mixture of open-world exploration and third-person shooting mechanics wrapped up in a crime drama narrative. The latest game in the series takes place in New Bordeaux, a fictional take on New Orleans, and its 1960s-era setting introduces period-appropriate background music and weaponry. PC players may already have the hardware necessary to run Mafia III at its basic settings, as the game demands an Intel I5-2500K or AMD FX-8120 CPU at a minimum, with either a Radeon HD7870 or GeForce GTX 660 equivalent tackling GPU duties. Mafia III also requires a 64-bit version of Windows 7, 50GB of hard drive space, and 2GB of video memory to function. Open-world games are often demanding at higher resolutions and graphics settings, and Mafia III is no different. Publisher 2K recommends an Intel I7-3770 or AMD FX 8350 4.0 GHz equivalent in terms of CPU horsepower, while a Radeon R9 290X, GeForce GTX 780, or GeForce GTX 1060 are required for max settings. Players seeking to render Mafia III at its best possible quality will also need 8GB of RAM and 4GB of video memory, according to 2K’s pre-release estimates. Mafia III is set to be the biggest entry in the series, and 2K is preparing a special collector’s edition for die-hard fans. Players who pick up the collector’s edition at launch will receive an art book, a set of replica dog tags, drink coasters, and collectible art prints as part of the package, along with copies of the game’s score and official soundtrack on vinyl records. Mafia III launches for the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC platforms worldwide on October 7. Also watch: Asus ROG GX700 Hands On Please enable Javascript to watch this video

But a team of scientists from Intel Labs and Darmstadt University in Germany have figured out a way to use data from GTA to better teach autonomous cars how to drive in the real world. By combining an algorithm that can pull visual data from GTA and enter it into a machine learning program, scientists hope to significantly reduce the amount of time needed to collect data. MORE: Apple's $1 Billion Investment Paves Way for Self-Driving Cars The time savings comes from the fact that it takes thousands of hours to teach autonomous cars how to drive, which means either going out and recording video on real roads or using computer-generated scenarios like the ones in GTA. And for those worried about potential issues that might arise from using data from a video game, the scientists say that data from games like GTA can be just as good, if not better than data from real life. It’s important to point out that the algorithm isn’t necessarily instructing autonomous cars how to drive by analyzing traffic patterns. Instead, it's more focused on teaching object recognition so that self-driving cars can tell the difference between other cars and objects like pedestrians or animals. For a more in-depth explanation, check out the short video above from the scientists themselves.

The dual cameras, in particular, suggest a future that could be a step toward a broader play on virtual reality. "Dual camera means depth, and depth means three things," said Alban Denoyel, CEO of 3-D company Sketchfab in an email interview with Recode. Capturing depth information, he said, allows for capturing a three-dimensional scene, positional tracking and gesture recognition. That, he said, puts Apple on equal footing with other players in the space including Intel’s RealSense, Vuforia, Leap Motion and Google Tango. And while Apple didn’t talk about virtual or augmented reality on tage last week, it has expressed interest in the markets and made acquisitions to better position itself, including PrimeSense and LinX. Apple’s initial use of the two cameras is far more modest. As the iPhone 7 ships, the dual cameras are being used only to offer zooming capability. Apple has also said it will add a depth portrait feature later this year that will combine the images to offer a blurred background. "As you know, Apple likes to ship a new hardware feature with one use case first and add uses and iterate over time," mobile expert Benedict Evans told Recode. "So it's more suggestive than tangible." Still, Evans said this represents a big step, reminding people that Apple added a fingerprint sensor to the iPhone a year before it introduced Apple Pay. Adding even more camera modules could lead to even more imaging ability. That’s the approach taken by startup Light, which uses 16 different smartphone modules in an attempt to take on SLR cameras. Even with two cameras, Apple could do more out of the gate. But Apple is letting other companies make their own use of the data coming from the two cameras, potentially meaning others could create virtual reality and other applications ahead of the iPhone maker. "It seems to me they have the hardware ready, but they don’t have everything worked out yet," Light co-founder Rajiv Laroia said in an interview. "Some things have been left for the future or third parties." The dual cameras, only available on the iPhone 7 Plus that goes on sale Friday, are seen as the most tangible way in which Apple’s future is on display in its new phone. It’s not just the cameras, though. Apple’s wireless headphones, called AirPods, also show Apple’s ability to seamlessly connect the iPhone to other devices. While the AirPods do use Bluetooth, Apple has done a lot of work in silicon and in software to make wireless connections simpler and more power efficient. That’s tech that could come in handy for other add-ons well beyond headphones. Also, with iOS 10, Apple is moving further into machine learning. Until now, Apple had been seen as being at risk of falling behind in this area, especially given its strict privacy policy, which limits the amount of data it collects. Apple says it now feels it can both collect the data it needs to get better at things like categorizing photos while also protecting users, using an approach known as differential privacy. And Apple says it won’t collect such information unless people explicitly give their okay. Evans says machine learning appears to have a wide range of uses and sees the technology being "applied very broadly across the industry and not for things that look like obvious database/machine-learning problems." Apple is starting with a few specific areas, such as emoji and deep links within applications. But this, too, appears to be a starting point rather than an end state. iPhone 7 Plus camera features recode_divider In this Storystream All about the iPhone 7 What the iPhone 7 reveals about Apple’s augmented-reality plans What the iPhone 7 tells us about the future of Apple Apple created extra versions of the iPhone 7 in order to make room for an Intel chip View all 13 stories More From Recode DraftKings and FanDuel used to hate each other.

Now, there’s word that the company is preparing a change to its manufacturing procedure that could help secure an even more dominant position. Samsung is apparently pursuing a longstanding desire to develop a GPU in-house for use with its mobile processors. The company is in talks with both AMD and Nvidia with a view to licensing its GPU technologies, according to a report from Sam Mobile. As far back as 2014, there were rumors that Samsung had hired engineers from companies like AMD, Nvidia, and Intel in order to accelerate its plan for internal GPU development. At one point, it was expected that the firm would be able to implement its Exynos chipset with a proprietary GPU for the Galaxy Note 5 — but this never came to pass. Related: Six-year-old gets burned after Samsung Galaxy Note 7 explodes in his hands At present, Samsung uses the Mali series of GPUs developed by ARM for its Exynos chipsets. However, based on these talks with AMD and Nvidia, it seems that the current arrangement may come to an end sooner rather than later. Shifting to internal development of GPUs would allow Samsung to cut costs accrued outsourcing the components, even allowing for the licensing fees that would need to be paid to whichever company’s tech is being used. It remains to be seen whether the end goal is simply larger profit margins, or the ability to undercut the pricing of its rivals. Given that the company is still in talks with AMD and Nvidia, the situation is still very fluid. However, this weekend’s reporting indicates that Nvidia is currently the front-runner thanks to the strength of its Pascal architecture.

In this report, Technavio covers the market outlook and growth prospects of the global GPU market for 2016-2020. Based on end-user platform, the market is segmented into desktops and notebooks. The notebooks segment dominated the market with over 63% in 2015. Technavio researchers found that the growing adoption of integrated GPU is a major driver for the growth of the market. Integrated GPU is more popular than discrete GPU. Intel, one of the prominent vendors of integrated GPU, claims that their integrated GPU is 30 times more efficient than discrete GPU. This can affect the adoption of discrete GPU units. “The increasing adoption of integrated GPU is mainly attributed to the growing need of enhanced visual content by end-consumers. In addition, end-consumers are demanding high memory graphics in their systems. In order to meet such demands, graphic processor vendors are providing high graphics through integrated GPUs. Currently, notebooks are being designed with integrated GPUs that meet end-user requirements,” says Sunil Kumar Singh, a lead analyst at Technavio for research on embeddedsystems. Technavio’s research study segments the global GPU market into the following regions: APAC Americas EMEA Global GPU market segmentation by geography 2015 (market share %)     APAC 37.10% Americas 32.60% EMEA 30.3% Source: Technavio   APAC: largest GPU market The GPU market in APAC is expected to see a decline during the forecast period because of the withdrawal of consumer interest in laptops. Though the market is not fully saturated with a penetration level of less than 70%, there is a higher demand for laptops because of the reduced ASP. Chromebooks and netbooks are easier options but they require highly developed cloud infrastructure. Also, their ASP is lower than that of traditional or hybridlaptops, which will offset their revenue share even if there is an increase in the unit shipments of Chromebooks and netbooks and hybrid laptops. Hybrid laptops will generate majority of the revenue, but laptop manufacturers will have difficulty in deciding the type of customers they need to pitch their products for, because of the high ASP of laptops. In the first quarter of 2015, hybrid laptops generated higher revenue from commercial customers than from retail or personal customers. Request a sample report: http://www.technavio.com/request-a-sample?report=52974 Technavio’s sample reports are free of charge and contain multiple sections of the report including the market size and forecast, drivers, challenges, trends, and more. Americas: highest laptop sales revenue emerged from the US in 2015 In 2015, 26.54 million units of GPU were shipped in the Americas, and this is expected to increase to 21.9 million units by 2020. From the annual reports of leading laptop manufacturers such as HP, Lenovo, and Apple, it was found that in the premium segment, the highest sales revenue came from the US in 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. Lenovo's Yoga hybrid laptop series generated huge sales revenue in the US. Also, 85% of Chromebooks and netbooks were sold in North America, with 90% of the sales revenue coming from educational institutes. As the Chromebook and netbook market in North America is already getting saturated, the only source of revenue from such a market is innovative hybrid laptop products. New range of hybrid laptop products to rejuvenate growth in EMEA The GPU market in EMEA is highly saturated and the socio-economic factors have not been favorable in recent years; hence, the growth was comparatively low. However, the new range of hybrid laptop products is designed to rejuvenate the interest of customers looking for innovative products. The laptop manufacturers gain profit from hybrid laptops and low-cost Chromebooks and netbooks. Though the hybrid laptop market will target corporate customers, the Chromebooks and netbooks market will target educational institutes, which is similar to the trend in North America. “Europe is the major revenue contributor in EMEA. This is because of high sales of notebooks, desktops, and workstations in this region. The increasing need for enhanced visual content is another major factor contributing to the growth of the market in this region,” adds Sunil.

Apple highlighted the difference on the technical specification page for the iPhone 7. Models A1778 and A1784 do not support CDMA networks, such as those used by Verizon and Sprint. The reason these models don't support CDMA is likely Apple's decision to diversify suppliers using Intel for the modem in the AT&T and T-Mobile models and Qualcomm for the modem in the other models. Re/code confirms this is likely the case, "Sources familiar with the situation as well as outsiders agree that the modem diversification effort is the likely reason for the separate phone versions. Apple and Intel declined to comment on the matter, and a Qualcomm representative was not immediately available for comment."

Christoph Hagleitne presented IBM’s view of the major applications where FPGAs can provide differentiation such as cognitive computing, high performance computing and the Internet of Things. He described two complementary approaches to establish heterogeneous computing systems in cloud datacenters. The first approach is based on heterogeneous supernodes that tightly couple compute resources to multi-core CPUs and their coherent memory system via high-bandwidth, low latency interconnects like CAPI or NVlink. The second approach is based on the disaggregation of data center resources where the individual compute, memory, and storage resources are connected via the network fabric and can be individually optimized and scaled in line with the cloud paradigm.

Bring it on. How Pittsburgh became Uber’s testing ground No driver? Bring it on. How Pittsburgh became Uber’s testing ground Uber cars prepare to roll through Pittsburgh to map out the roads and topography before the introduction of the company’s driverless vehicles. By Cecilia Kang, New York Times News Service September 11, 2016 PITTSBURGH — Any day now, Uber will introduce a fleet of self-driving cars in Pittsburgh, making this former steel town the world’s first city to let passengers hail autonomous vehicles. So with the world watching, what has the city of 306,000 done to prepare for Uber’s unprecedented test? The answer is not much. There have been no public service announcements or demonstrations of the technology. Except for the mayor and one police official, no other top city leader has seen a self-driving Uber vehicle operate up close. Fire and emergency services don’t know where the Uber cars will travel. Advertisement It is precisely this hands-off approach that has made Pittsburgh ideal grounds for one of Silicon Valley’s boldest experiments — and it has ignited criticism that the city is giving away its keys to Uber, which is testing a nascent technology and has a reputation for running roughshod over regulators and municipalities. “It’s not our role to throw up regulations or limit companies like Uber,” said Bill Peduto, Pittsburgh’s mayor, who said that Uber planned to use about 100 modified Volvo sport utility vehicles for the passenger trials. The vehicles will also have a human monitor behind the wheel. “You can either put up red tape or roll out the red carpet. If you want to be a 21st-century laboratory for technology, you put out the carpet.” The mayor’s mantra highlights what it takes these days as cities seek to shed their Rust Belt pasts and transform themselves into technology hubs — essentially, give the tech companies lots of free rein. The approach, described as greenlight governing, is one that Pittsburgh and the state of Pennsylvania have nurtured over the last few years. When Uber wanted to expand its research around autonomous vehicles, Pittsburgh helped the company lease a large plot near the city’s riverfront for a testing track. When state regulators tried to ban ride-hailing services in 2014, Pittsburgh’s mayor and the state’s governor helped bat those hurdles down. Otherwise, Pittsburgh’s politicians stay out of the way. Mayor Bill Peduto has worked with Uber to allow access to test its vehicles on Pittsburgh streets. “You can either put up red tape or roll out the red carpet,” he said. Advertisement The approach has many benefits, allowing Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania to position themselves at the forefront of a driverless-vehicle movement that has swept up tech companies including automakers, Google and Baidu of China. It has brought tech entrepreneurs to Pittsburgh and attracted hundreds of scientists and engineers to new research centers opened in the city in the last decade by Apple, Google, Intel and Uber. But it also has invited criticism from those who say Pittsburgh is giving too much power to tech companies, all for a sheen of innovation. Some residents are on edge about Uber’s self-driving vehicles and complain that they have been thrust into an experiment with potential safety risks. “I feel like we were pushed into being part of this by the city,” said Montana Michniak, a recent college graduate who works at a cafe in the city’s South Side neighborhood. How Pittsburgh handles the unveiling of Uber’s self-driving fleet is being closely watched by other tech and auto companies that are doing their own driverless experiments in places like California and Michigan (although Apple is said to have laid off dozens of employees in its self-driving car project and to be rethinking its strategy). Depressed cities around the nation are watching to see if the Pittsburgh story can be a blueprint for their own transitions into tech hubs. “This is the first mayor in Pittsburgh to really get it, and that’s a big reason why the city has become the best case of Rust Belt revival,” said Richard Florida, a professor of urban studies at the University of Toronto, who previously taught at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. He said he was “frankly surprised at how long a leash” Uber got. Advertisement Peduto said Uber did not have too much power in Pittsburgh and that the city would be safe because there would be a human monitor in the Uber test cars. The mayor also has his eye on a bigger safety goal. “There is no technology that is fail-proof, and there is no tech that can guarantee there won’t be accidents, but right now there are 3,287 people who die in automobile-related accidents around the world each day, and there has to be a better way,” he said. When Uber wanted to expand its research on autonomous vehicles, Pittsburgh helped the company lease a large plot near the city’s riverfront for a testing track. In a statement, Uber said of Pittsburgh, “Our work would not be possible without the support we’ve received from city leaders.” Uber came to Pittsburgh in early 2015, drawn by the engineering talent at Carnegie Mellon. The university started a robotics department 30 years ago, when driverless cars seemed like a fantasy, but robotics has since proved crucial for the systems that let vehicles navigate streets on their own. By this decade, the university’s expertise in computer science had attracted not only Uber but also General Motors, Google and Intel, some of which embedded at Carnegie Mellon. Google and Uber later opened research centers, hiring dozens of Carnegie Mellon professors and graduate students. Today, Uber has 500 employees at a center in Pittsburgh’s industrial Strip District working on autonomous vehicles, according to Peduto. Uber will have 1,000 employees at the site, known as the Advanced Technology Center, within a few years and plans to increase investments to $1 billion from hundreds of millions of dollars in a decade, he said. For driverless car tests, Pennsylvania also held a legal advantage. Specifically, the state’s transportation rules did not explicitly ban driverless cars, as long as someone was behind the wheel to take over if needed. Officials from Pennsylvania’s transportation agency said they interpreted that silence on driverless technology as a green light. Some state officials said they also believed that driverless cars could be safer than those steered by drivers, helping avoid driver-related deaths. “We’d be committing governmental malpractice if we didn’t pursue this technology,” said Roger Cohen, the policy director of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. Driverless cars with Uber’s logo have cruised around town for months, in part to get the public used to seeing them. In Pittsburgh, Peduto fostered a close relationship with Uber. In Peduto’s first meeting in early 2015 with Uber’s chief executive, Travis Kalanick, Kalanick said he had noticed efforts by Peduto and other officials to fight the state public utilities commission’s proposed ban on ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft in 2014. Kalanick also laid out a plan for Uber’s driverless cars. “Travis’ vision was to build out the autonomous vehicles industry in 10 years,” Peduto said. “We shared a vision to do it in a way that would be a benefit for society.” Weeks later, in a meeting with President Barack Obama at a conference for the National League of Cities, Peduto urged Obama to support autonomous vehicles and declared Pittsburgh’s intention to be a testing ground. Since then, Pittsburgh has showed its friendliness to Uber’s efforts. Last year, it also worked with the city’s police department on plans to install a ride-hailing kiosk in the lively South Side district, for the use of people who had been drinking and would prefer not to drive home. Pittsburgh International Airport last year also designated waiting areas for Uber and Lyft passengers. Yet Uber has mostly gone ahead with its self-driving-car plans in Pittsburgh alone. Driverless cars with Uber’s logo have cruised around town for months, in part to get the public used to seeing them. With cameras and GPS units mounted on the roofs, the vehicles collect mapping data on plants and trees, the conditions of sidewalks, and traffic markings for nearly every street. “There’s really not been a whole lot of collaboration on the actual testing,” said Scott Schubert, Pittsburgh’s assistant chief of police, who rode in one of the Uber vehicles last June and signed a nondisclosure agreement to do so. Last month, Uber officially announced that the self-driving fleet would go into action in Pittsburgh. Peduto, who had been informed a few days earlier by Uber, sent a congratulatory text message to Kalanick. Uber’s chief was in Pittsburgh at the time and invited the mayor to be the city’s first driverless-car passenger. After the 2-mile ride home, Peduto posted on Twitter that he ended that day as the world’s first mayor chauffeured by an autonomous Uber car. “I feel fortunate that I have the ear of a CEO of one of the biggest privately held companies,” he said.

Simple titled “Get the Surface Pro,” the 30-second ad highlights Microsoft’s Surface Pro 4 hybrid device which includes a stylus and comes with a detachable keyboard and an Intel chip allowing it to be transformed into a computer that runs Windows, Office and other real desktop applications. Using the same singer from the previous commercial, the new video informs us that “If you try to write on a plain old Mac, the difference can be seen. It doesn’t work.” “With a pen that lets you write on the screen, a detachable keyboard, and tunes like this, Surface Pro 4 is the easy choice,” says Microsoft. And here’s the new Surface ad. Microsoft’s anti-Apple campaign for the Surface Pro includes other stingy commercials, one calling the MacBook Air “less useful, like a hat for your cat” and the others boasting about such Surface Pro 4 features as Intel Core processor, detachable keyboard with real keys and a trackpad, pen, touchscreen, full Office and external ports. “Everything else is just late to the party,” argues Microsoft in another dig at Apple and its latest iPad Pro ads which attempt to position the device as a computer replacement.

Prasoon Singh Yup. Dany Quirion so why making phone of it? its competitor is the ipad not mac XD Umut Topuz no its not due to its operating system. its much like a ultrabook with optinal keyboard. A bit weird but it is George It’s a hybrid. Srv Rungta so we’re comparing apples with oranges now! …hmm… great!! (NOT) Julio Hernandez Well Surface Pro is better than iPad or MacBooks in my opinion smtp25 Well Apple is trying to say iPad pro is laptop replacement, so fair enuff that the pit the surface against the iPad. iPad is cool, I have 2 but they are no laptop or surface – different tool for different jobs. paul_krupa If the only tool you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. You can’t run MacOS on a Windows machine so I’m not your likely convert back to Windows. Why would I want to use Windows? Not so many surfaces sold compared to iPads or MacBooks. Surface has some nice elements to it but at the end of the day it’s a Windows machine. I only use those when I have to. Oh, the ad was okay. Sort of like Trump without the vulgarity. Umut Topuz I was using dual os. windows 10 and macos on my surface pro 3 paul_krupa I’ve seen where MacOS can run on other platforms but I can’t get a legal way to do that. Further, it’s a big ask to buy into what I consider a lot of Windows baggage (not being derogatory just stating that I don’t want to get too involved in another OS, especially all the registry stuff) in order to run my preferred platform. Further still, I am not a touch screen advocate for laptops and prefer the trackpad. So in my case I prefer running fusion when I need windows. And Fusion allows me to manage my VM’s on my home server without having to run the windows app (except for a few tasks). :D The real joke is Windows gary You mean the most widely-distributed operating system in the world? I am not advocating one side of this argument over the other, I just think this comment is dumb. :D The real joke is that such a crappy OS is the most widely-distributed OS in the world. Happy? gary You didn’t happen to stop and think that you might be in the extremely small minority on that one and that you’re not really clever? :D Is that so? I’m not clever? If you had any idea of the things I’ve accomplished then you would be eating those words. I look down at you. gary LMAO Jm Android is the most widely-distributed OS in the world by nearly 5 times of Windows, so not sure why you’re bringing Android into the discussion. But even iOS/OS X has more usage than Windows in 2016, so your delusional bias against OS X is not only stupid based on its own merits, but it’s factually incorrect. Try again. gary I think there are two things you missed: 1) this conversation is clearly about desktop operating systems given the context of the article and both his and my comments. Also, android is not distributed five times as much as Windows, that is simply wrong and ludicrous. 2) I think you also missed the part where I said I’m not advocating for either side, so this “delusional bias against OS X” doesn’t exist. I use both operating systems and like each for what they are good at. I know where your ‘delusional bias’ sits though. Gabriel Anaya Hey guys,make sure to upgrade to MacOS Sierra ASAP, or Apple will charge you $100 bucks to upgrade after the first year. Okay not really but how stupid would that be? Umut Topuz its a bit weird but apple was forcing people to pay $10 for ios 1 to 2 upgrade 🙂 :D OS X updates used to be charged for too – Apple Just decided to make updates free. The thing is that MS made Windows 10 free for anyone who updates in the first year. Anyone who updates after a year has to pay. Maybe it’s just their way of improving adoption rates but it’s still pretty stupid imo. Umut Topuz dont understand why it had too much intention. they just let people to go for an upgrade for free. maybe they are moving to that way just like apple did? What if they put a price without letting you upgrade in a year? 🙂 George You’re already paying for software you just don’t see it. Paying over $1200 for a laptop is buying into the ecosystem. Jeffrey Well you can sell your 1200 dollar macbook 3 years later for 900 dollars and you can sell your 1200 dollar windows laptop (with payed OS) 3 years later for 150 dollars… What do you choose? George I know that, I’m a Mac user. I’m just saying windows PCs are cheaply priced which is why they can get away with separately charging you for a big software release. Jeffrey Well, yeah, if you look at the short term Windows desktops do in fact sound cheaper, even when you count the software costs, I agree. But when you’re smart, you think about the long term 🙂 PhoneTechJay I see where you were headed with this comment but you are forgetting that windows labtops can cost this much too… George And also Microsoft is a software company, you don’t think it’s silly for a software company to be giving away free software? They wouldn’t be here today. Agneev Mukherjee Are we running short on crazy? This Surface proves nothing less. Agneev Mukherjee The cat looks absurd. I like Cookie Monster better. Agneev Mukherjee Hover your cursor over the blank area between here You’ve found it! and here. Agneev Mukherjee var foo = 'bar'; alert('foo'); Mike M. Powell Am I the only that that Actually doesn’t care that Mac doesn’t allow fingerprint? Prasoon Singh You know why the Mac doesn’t have a touchscreen? Because it’s not a freaking tablet! That’s what iPads are for. These ads makes me mad. Umut Topuz ipads are just big touchscreen gaming device for me. it doesnt have a fully functional operating system, not even a usb port? so due its hardware specs and type of things it do, equivalent is macbook anon Weird, since iOS 10 my iPad took over and I only use my PC for games occasionally. Umut Topuz it is just a nearby couch device for me, even i use it with jailbreak, i just dont find it useful enough to pay that price for an ipad besides a surface smtp25 totally agree – its great for games, videos, web browsing.. ahh that’s all I used it for.. even serious web browsing I find easier and quick on the laptop with mouse smtp25 Because lots of newer laptops have touch screens now, and because of tablets people have a higher expectation to be able to touch the screen to do something and be disappointed when they remember they can’t ravinigga Somebody just hack or put macos on iPad Pro with touch capabilities. Then we talk. Btw love both Alberto Espinal I’ve never had this product but I’m gonna quote someone that had one and this is what he said: “It doesn’t really matter if it’s a tablet in form, and features a touchscreen etc.. When you have next to none “touch optimised” apps and user experiences to offer. All the “apps” in the Windows Store are plain horrible and lacklustre. The amount of apps offered are really low, and the ones being offered often costs money for no apparent reason and they don’t really offer anything. The whole tablet / touch ecosystem is non-existent” anon Of course the keyboard comes off when you sell it separately Joseph Apodaca Wow. Now I’m going to get a surface pro solely for a touchscreen display. *sarcasm smtp25 I’m not getting one because its probably not powerful enough graphics wise to play games high end PC games, so big price tag small result Umut Topuz so you are expecting to play high end games on a laptop priced as a surface by not having a console or desktop. very genius act, go for it 🙂 smtp25 what are you on about? Surface 4 i5/8GB/256GB is NZD$2349 or i7 $2899. I can get a laptop for $2300/2800 that will play high end games. Console, well they suck because I like using a mouse for FPS. And a desktop obviously sucks as its not portable. Umut Topuz allright, play “high end” fps games on a laptop with mid range gpu with your mouse for an hour of portability which may fit your needs. what are you up to?

How we used Linux 12 September 2016 on linux Introduction Industrial Automation is an industry that's always 10 years behind mainstream technologies. This is partly due to the large monopoly held by the three main players, Siemens, Allen Bradley & Wonderware. This has led to an unfortunate lack of innovation, especially in native industrial web applications, Which are almost nonexistent. At Bubble Automation we saw this as an issue. Most clients who wanted remote monitoring capabilities of their sites were stuck using clunky add-ons. Add-ons requiring large license fees and maintenance costs, or insecure TeamViewer/VNC connections needing third party tools to be installed on the clients machines. Our Aim We wanted to build a modern secure native web application that required no browser or PC plugins. Need to provide live data and work on any device e.g mobile, tablet, netbook & desktop to prevent the need for unnecessary platform dependant apps. For security, the web server had to be on the customer's premise, small enough to be put in a control panel and robust enough to survive industrial conditions. Choosing the Framework NodeJS was the first framework we tested, it seemed promising but at the time wasn't the most stable or well-supported platform. The biggest issue was connecting to a database using their experimental database module. After trial and error with various frameworks, opting for a pure Python solution seemed most convenient partly due to our in-house python experience, but most importantly its wide module support. Selecting the Right Hardware After a very brief experience using current industrial grade single board computers, it was immediately obvious they weren't suitable. Most use out-dated Intel Atoms in large noisy enclosures. This sent us on the path of today's competitive credit sized PC market, listed are a few we've tried: Raspberry Pi 2 Model B Raspberry Pi 1 Model B ODROID-U3 Odroid C1 Odroid XU4 Each board was extensively tested running our Python framework with unrealistic loads. The board that stood out was the ODROID XU4 which was clearly superior all round as shown in the benchmarks below. This board had far better CPU and network performance, but most importantly much higher I/O speeds and bandwidth which was critical for our MySQL database. dhrystone Results are an index relative to a SPARCstation 20-61 (rated at 10.0) Source whetstone Results are an index relative to a SPARCstation 20-61 (rated at 10.0) Source hdparm Results are in megabytes per second. Source dd Results are in megabytes per second. Source Architecture & Software Design The basic starting point was to create a daemon that could read Modbus registers over TCP/IP from the field as shown in figure 1. This later grew to a context sensitive event based system that could translate field events into Alarms, Live Trending, Historical graphs, Event logs, & notification emails. Figure 1. Providing this information to the client proved to be a difficult task; displaying Real Time information on a web page in pure HTML5 requiring no plugins has never been easy. Using techniques such as long polling would only lead to crashing the browser as there was just far too much information that needed to be fed into the browser at relatively high speed, at around 1-second scan intervals. Our solutions came back to the reason NodeJS was such a good candidate for Real Time data solutions, that was Web Sockets. This provides full-duplex communication over a TCP connection. Thankfully we came across a powerful PHP Library that provided this functionality. For this reason, we could build all server side components in PHP using Twitter Bootstrap to provide a simple interface with responsive design at its forefront. A LEMP stack (Linux, Nginx, MySQL, & PHP) is used to provide a robust base with speed, stability, & reliability for our PHP, HTML, & Javascript front-end. The main reasons for using Nginx over Apache is its better utilization of multicore processors assigning a worker per core, and its better security track record over Apache. Front-end screenshot Security Due to the nature of our industry, building our application secure by design was critical. A lot of time was spend creating a secure login not vulnerable to SQL Injection, Session Hijacking, Cross Site Scripting, & Brute Force Attacks. To top this off we created a hardened minimal Linux image to use on our servers this is kept up to date with all of the current security patches. We work strictly on a non-control basis meaning in the unlikely event our software is compromised, there is no way the intruder could damage your site. Our software only monitors the state of the field and does not affect the control process. Conclusion Thanks to the high availability of small inexpensive single board computers and the large progression in Open Source software development, Bubble Automation has managed to bring innovation to an industrial market which is usually slow to take on modern ideologies. Our choice of using an Open Source foundation has eliminated expensive licensing fees and running costs for us and our clients giving our software a competitive edge.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search UMi Super Review (Euro Edition) JC Torres - Sep 12, 2016 4 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Editors' Rating: 7/10 Pros Competitive specs straddling mid and high range Fast charging right out of the box Near vanilla Android experience Choice between on-screen or capacitive navigation buttons Sub-$200 price tag Cons Camera is slow, too much noise in low light Smart Key can't be used when phone is still locked, can't function as camera shutter There are dozens of smartphone brands, many of them hailing from China, competing in the mid-range market that it is too easy to get lost in a sea of names, models and specs. So when a little known company poises itself as a flagship killer, with a price that neither OnePlus nor even Xiaomi can beat, it’s hard not to pause and take notice. In not so many words, or actually in quite many words, that is what the UMi Super aspires to be, and it does almost reach that pinnacle. Well, as high as a mid-range can reach. Read on to find out how that dream almost came to be. Specs Here’s a quick rundown of the UMi Super’s key hardware features, just to give you an overview of what’s in store: • Operating System: Android 6.0 Marshmallow • CPU: MediaTek Helio P10 octa-core • RAM: 4 GB Samsung LPDDR3 • Storage: 32 GB Samsung eMMC 5.1 • Display: 5.5-inch 1920×1080 Sharp LTPS • Main Camera: 13 megapixel Panasonic sensor • Secondary Camera: 5 megapixels • Battery: Sony 4,000 mAh, MediaTek Quick Charge PE+ The UMi Super straddles the fine line between mid-range and flagship, pairing a mid-range chip, the Helio P10, with 4 GB of memory found in most high-end smartphones this year. But perhaps more noticeable is how UMi seems to be name-dropping the makers of much of its components, aside from the processor, of course. Unless you’re Samsung or LG, chances are you’d be using components made by other companies. some of which might even be your competitors. Not even Apple is immune to that. UMi’s admission is admittedly a bit unusual in a fiercely competitive market like smartphones. At least, perhaps in UMi’s mind, it would assure buyers that they are getting a smartphone with quality components made by popular brands. Of course, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, and a mish-mash of super components does not a super smartphone make. Luckily for the UMi Super, it does in this case. Somewhat. Performance Processor No matter how the marketing tries to spin it, the Helio P10 is MediaTek’s mid-range processor, compared to its Helio X20 chip. It is like the Snapdragon 625 to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 820, or the Core m to Intel’s Core i. That’s not to downplay the capabilities of the chip but to properly frame it in the correct context. Which is to say that it won’t be running blazing fast, but it gets the job done, especially with a generous 4 GB of RAM. The UMi Super’s performance on Geekbench and AnTuTu benchmarks were quite impressive for a 2016 mid-ranger. On Geekbench, its multi-core score of 2665 outperforms even the NVIDIA SHIELD Tablet’s Tegra K1 chip as well as the Nexus 6. While the results on AnTuTu might not be that encouraging, it is being compared to late 2015 and early 2016 flagships. In short, the UMi Super is quite on par with 2014 smartphone champions and would solidly beat its contemporaries this year. Display A smartphone, however, isn’t simply a shrunken down computer. Most of our time spent with it is almost 95% on the display. That is why the quality of the screen is of utmost importance. Here, UMi’s name-dropping serves it well. A 5.5-inch 1080p display is actually on par with Chinese flagships this years, as those have refused to make the jump to 2K. But more than that, the UMi Super boasts of a display from Sharp. Granted, it’s not the famous Sharp IGZO technology but one of the company’s LTPS panels. That said, the end result is still, well, sharp and bright, an impressive feat for a smartphone of this price. Battery The UMi Super isn’t exactly a small smartphone, though not an obscenely large or thick one. In addition to its 5.5-inch screen, it’s also rather thick, 8.5 mm at the thickest point, though 7.9 mm at the thinnest, thanks to its lightly curving back. You might, however, forgive it that slight when you find out that it boasts of a 4,000 mAh battery from Sony. Again, the name-drop. If that weren’t enough, the UMi Super also boasts of fast charging capabilities, partly thanks to a USB-C connector from Foxconn as well as the “Pump Express Plus” or PE+ fast charging technology from MediaTek itself. For just 30 minutes, you’re promised a full day’s worth of uptime. Extend that to 100 minutes and you reach a full charge. Not bad for a sub $200 smartphone. Design We seem to be happily past the days when “cheap” translated to cheap, flimsy materials, even though not all plastics are such. Even budget-friendly smartphones these days can flaunt all their metal sides and edges. The UMi Super is similar, boasting of an all-metal body made from aircraft-grade alloy. The UMi Super’s design seems to revolve around the ideas of minimalism and simplicity, both in the design of the hardware itself as well as the software, as we’ll see later. The overall shape of the device is one most will be familiar with, with flat, chamfered edges and a tri-segmented rear that curves ever so slightly to both accommodate a larger battery as well as offer a better fit inside users’ hands. The back has nothing but the camera, the dual LED flash beneath, and the fingerprint scanner below that. Around the edges, there are no hidden surprises, though one might jump to the conclusion that there is no headphone jack given the solitary USB-C port at the bottom. The 3.5 mm port, however, is located at the top. On the right side you get the usual volume rocker as well as a power button. On the opposite left edge is the SIM and microSD card hybrid slot as well as a “smart key” that can be configured to quickly launch any app of choice. The front of the smartphone is even more bare. No branding or even buttons in sight. At least not physical buttons. In lieu of a physical home button, the UMi Super has a capacitive one that is marked by an LED halo. This isn’t a simple aesthetic feature either. Flanking this home “button” are two other capacitive buttons for navigation. As we’ll see later, however, that’s not yet the complete story. A rather interesting design choice is one that’s available for a very limited time, in very limited numbers, and in limited markets. This special Euro Edition comes in a bright shade of royal blue, a hue that you won’t easily find among all metal smartphones. There are only 999 such devices available, which are bound to be head turners because of their spectacular specular. Camera These days, smartphones makers are putting a lot of focus on the camera, no pun intended. While the UMi Super is definitely no different, the end result is a mixed bag. On paper, the smartphone boasts of a 13 megapixel Panasonic sensor that has zero shutter lag and takes only 0.3 seconds to focus. In practice, however, the UMi Super failed to live up to its claims of speed. Slow cameras translate to missed moments. High megapixel counts become worthless when you fail to take that once in a lifetime shot just right. That said, the camera does a decent job under ideal conditions, namely, bright, but not so bright, ambient light, sufficient contrast, and slow-moving or still subjects. The camera’s quality breaks down easily in low light situations, where even the dual flash can’t help reduce the resulting noise. Again, the key here is that the UMi Super offers a decent camera you won’t easily find in smartphones of its price tier. Software and Features The UMi Super’s minimalist theme extends to its software. Unlike its Chinese peers, UMi offers no special Android user experience or UX. You are basically getting an almost Nexus experience with the vanilla Android 6.0 Marshmallow right out of the box. Those who customize their Android phones with mods and add-ons will probably love how they can start with a blank slate. And no Android user will complain about how fast and responsive a non-bloated Android experience can be. Of course, there are a few special features included, and perhaps the most special one are the navigation buttons. As mentioned, there are capacitive buttons, one “halo” and two invisible ones. However, UMi also gives users the choice to turn those off and switch to on-screen buttons instead, pretty much like an untouched Android. But UMi doesn’t stop there either. You can swap the positions of the back and recent apps buttons to your hand preference, which would probably explain the invisible capacitive buttons. But wait, there’s more! When using on-screen navigation buttons, you can also slide them away so that you have the whole span of the screen for content, no matter what app you’re in. One other feature of the UMi Super is also one of its most curious. The LED glow around the capacitive home button is actually configurable to use different colors depending on the source of the notification. You can, for example, set a different color for missed calls, one for alarms, and another one for Facebook alerts. This is similar to the new Smart Glow feature that Samsung introduced in the new Galaxy J2 (2016), except in the front where it is more visible and noticeable. Wrap-up You might get the idea that the UMi Super is simply a decent, good looking mid-range smartphone that offers a vanilla Android experience. Truth be told, taken in isolation, that’s pretty much what it is. But here’s the clincher: the UMi Super costs only $180 at its lowest (some retailers do hold it hostage for $220). And that limited edition blue Euro Edition? $199. Even Xiaomi, notorious for its dirt cheap prices, will have trouble matching that in terms of back for buck, not to mention market availability. The price point is usually reserved for entry-level devices that won’t be able to compete in specs, features, and design. So to rephrase it a bit, the UMi Super is a decent mid-range smartphone, made from premium materials, with an almost pure Android experience, and a entry-level price tag. It’s really hard not to get floored by that. The recent spate of new mid-range challengers in the smartphone market heralds a new phase in the history of the device, where everyone who isn’t Samsung, Apple, LG, and the like are instead battling out in below the flagship line. It is, however, also blurring the lines between tiers and prices. And the UMi Super just demonstrated that if you try hard enough, you can indeed make miracles.

The XMG P507 doesn’t look like much, but its dour exterior conceals one of the world’s most potent laptop GPUs – the new mobile variant of the GTX 1070. The new GPU uses Nvidia’s stunning Pascal architecture, which delivered huge performance and efficiency improvements on in desktop form. How does it handle the thermal challenges of a laptop? With aplomb. Video: How to choose a laptop in 2016 Related: Best PC games XMG P507 – Features It’s worth taking a second just to explain Nvidia’s naming strategy with its latest line of mobile GPUs – it’s a little confusing. The GTX 1070 inside this laptop is actually the same part as the desktop card, with the same Pascal architecture – something that's only now possible because of the huge efficiency gains that Nvidia made with its new hardware. The only differences between the desktop and mobile parts are minor specification changes, which mean that mobile users now get the same high-end, VR-friendly experience as desktop gamers. Video: Watch our review of the desktop Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 The GTX 1070 inside this laptop is fearsome. The mobile variant has 2,048 stream processors and a 1,645MHz boost clock, while the desktop card has 1,920 stream processors but a higher clock speed. The mobile core retains the 8GB of GDDR5 memory of its desktop counterpart alongside an 8,000MHz clock speed. Those specifications blow away the equivalent machines from the previous generation. Since this XMG is the first gaming laptop we've reviewed from the current generation, comparisons are hard. For the purposes of this review, I'll compare it to two laptops from the previous generation: one larger and one smaller. It's safe to assume that both will be updated with 10-series GPUs shortly. The larger, 17.3-inch CyberPower Fangbook 4 SK-X17 had a desktop-class GTX 980 that also has 2,048 stream processors, but its peak 1,253MHz speed and 4GB of memory pale in comparison to the GTX 1070. The Gigabyte Aorus X3 Plus V5 had a GTX 970M that has 6GB of memory but only 1,280 stream processors and a 993MHz average boost. There’s a lot to like about the rest of the XMG’s specification, even if the rest of this machine doesn’t push the envelope. The Core i7-6700HQ is one of Intel’s mobile stalwarts thanks to its four cores, 2.6GHz stock speed and 3.5GHz peak. There’s the familiar 16GB of DDR4 memory, and storage is divided between a 256GB Samsung SM951 M.2 SSD and a 1TB hard disk. The screen is pretty conventional: a 15.6-inch model with G-Sync and a 1080p resolution. The former feature eliminates juddering by matching the GPU’s output with the screen’s refresh rate, and it’s a welcome addition – but the 1080p resolution seems odd, as the GTX 1070 can easily handle far more pixels. Connectivity is good: Gigabit Ethernet, dual-band 802.11ac wireless and Bluetooth on the inside, and three USB 3 ports alongside pairs of USB 3.1 Type-C and Mini DisplayPort connectors around the edges. There are also slots for SD and SIM cards. As ever, different specifications are available if you don’t need this machine’s level of power. Dropping down to the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 reduces the price to £1,609, and the cheapest specification has the GTX 1060 alongside 8GB of single-channel memory, a small hard disk, no SSD and no operating system for a tempting £1,299 including VAT. Related: Best SSDs to buy XMG P507 – Design Little on the outside suggests that this machine is one of the most powerful gaming notebooks on the market. The P507 is made from aluminium and the lid is decorated with a subtle XMG logo. Ease the 15.6-inch screen back and the interior is just as subtle: there’s a tiny XMG logo beneath the screen and a group of stickers on the wrist-rest, but that’s it. This is not necessarily a bad thing. The CyberPower and Aorus are much more obvious gaming machines with the former serving up a multi-coloured backlit keyboard and the latter cramming dramatic vents into its 13.3-inch frame. The XMG weighs in at 2.94kg and is 32mm at its thickest point. That’s comfortably lighter and slimmer than the CyberPower and its 17.3-inch screen, but about a kilo heavier and almost a centimetre thicker than the Aorus. In short, this machine slots right in between the competition, and it’s not so thick and heavy that it’s going to be awkward to carry it around, as long as you don't plan on actually using it on the move. Build quality is only middling – a slight disappointment for a laptop that costs nearly £2,000. There aren’t any major issues, but there’s a bit of a give in the wrist-rest and keyboard, and the base panel also exhibits a little weakness. There’s a huge amount of flex in the screen. This doesn't mean the whole thing's going to crumble after six months, but it just doesn't feel as grand as a £2,000 laptop should. The XMG lends itself to tinkering and upgrading. The base panel pops off easily after a few screws are removed, and the memory, SSD and hard disk are all accessible. The heatpipes and fans are easy to reach, and there’s room for another 2.5-inch hard disk inside, alongside a couple of spare M.2 connectors.

The card will be outdated by newer versions of Direct X, etc before it starts struggling to output smooth frame rates, especially with G Sync. I'm quite frankly sick and tired of laptop manufacturers going "it's HD!" as if that's something good. It might be for TVs, but PCs should have surpassed this kind of resolution yonks ago. When I was in the market for a laptop it took me ages to find a decent laptop without a "HD" screen being thrust in your face (which inevitably meant 720p)... The term "HD" took PC monitors back to the age of essentially running at the same resolution / pixel density as provided by 1024x768 which had long been surpassed but they lept on this HD crap to allow them to cheap out on the screen whilst making the marketing department happy. I ended up buying a bloody Mac to get a half decent screen resolution with all the other features I wanted, which was really annoying. joyce_duncan September 12, 2016, 1:08 pm I am making something like $6,000-$8,000 on monthly basis with an internet task. So if you are ready to do easy computer-based task for 2-5 hours every day at your home and get decent benefit in the same time... Test this invitation UR1.CA/pg5kh ujyj emtee September 12, 2016, 5:11 pm Does anyone actually buys crap like this? I dont understand.... It looks crappier than crap, i mean a basic shape like a Macbook is much easier to create and more appealing. Peace Keeper September 22, 2016, 6:00 pm This machine isn't that bad maybe the problem is with XMG (I think it's the same P650RS-G that Sager use to build the NP8153) it cost hundreds of dollars less than any other brand, I bought the NP8153 from Xotic with 4K panel but with 8GB DDR4 2400 and 1TB HDD for 1629$. So I will test it when arrive in 15 days and report the quality.

He achieves that only unintentionally of course, for the pompous and self-righteous make poor comedians. They can, however, often be unwittingly funny, especially if one has a sufficiently black sense of humour. Mind you, I didn’t manage a smile on August 31 when he retweeted from People magazine: “Today we remember with sadness! FROM THE ARCHIVES: The Shocking Death of Princess Diana, 19 Years Ago Today.” Share Facebook Twitter Google Email Go To Comments Considering every serious student of the IRA believes Mr Adams was on the Army Council in 1983 when it authorised an attempt on the lives of Prince Charles and Princess Diana, that’s a bit tasteless. But he did raise a smile from me in some of his comments over the contentious issue of Apple. The Republic of Ireland is trying to make sense of the recent ruling announced by Margrethe Vestager, the European Competition Commissioner, that Apple owes it £11 billion. Although that sum would pay the cost for a year of the country’s health service, recognising that if it seems too good to be true it probably is, serious Irish politicians and 62% of the public supported an appeal. The Irish are not mugs. They are well aware that since the 1980s their prosperity has depended on foreign direct investment by large — usually American — multinationals. More than 130,000 often high-grade jobs are widely provided by such companies as Boston Scientific, Dell, Facebook, Google, Intel, Hewlett Packard — and Apple — thus doing wonders not just for employment but for the country’s image. Ireland’s well-educated, English-speaking, EU workforce is attractive, but so too is its very low corporate tax rate of 12.5%, which Brussels — with its passion for uniformity — wants to get rid of. The Irish see the Apple ruling as a means on the road to that end, and remember the story of the farmer who was lucky enough to have a goose that daily laid a golden egg. Greed drove him to slay the bird, which then turned out to be no more valuable than any other dead goose.  There are other snags too about grabbing the money, not least that the US would like the tax for itself, and that the Commission has said that other EU countries could claim part of the tax if they believe that sales “could have been recorded in their jurisdictions”. Even if the Irish Government obeyed orders, there would be every chance it would still have to spend fortunes and years on legal wrangles. Ireland-EU relations are so tense people are beginning to whisper about ‘Irexit’, and honest public debate is a vital priority. That’s tough for Sinn Fein, whose lack of principle has been even more than usually evident over the past several months. Having been opposed to membership since before Ireland and the UK joined the European Economic Community in 1973, Sinn Fein did a U-turn for electoral reasons and opposed Brexit. In the Republic that abandoned the anti-EU battlefield to the far-Left. Now, as genuine anti-capitalists, People Before Profit and its allies are happy to demand the Irish Government take the money and run. But Sinn Fein — which tries to portray itself as a credible future coalition partner in the Republic — was left floundering and unable to address the practical arguments. So, from the blog of the always economically-challenged Mr Adams, we eventually got a tirade against world poverty, tax avoidance and various other wrongs that no Irish politician would dream of defending.  “Tax revenues,” he explained to the half-witted among us, “are the means by which public services are funded, by which we pay for social protections and from which infrastructure is developed.” Ignoring all complexities, he says, the Irish Government should take the money and spend it fast.  For “Sinn Fein believes firmly in tax fairness — that means that every person and every company pays their fair share of tax”. What’s more, “that has been our consistent position”. Let’s ignore that the IRA defrauded both states on this island throughout the Troubles and beyond.  It’s only last February that Mr Adams’ great friend, that “good republican” multi-millionaire Thomas ‘Slab’ Murphy, was jailed for brazen tax evasion. What can you do but laugh?

The company will use the funds mainly to enhance product capability and user experience and to expand its sales and marketing teams, Ajay Singh said. He didn’t reveal the names of the other investors. California, US-based Stoodnt Inc entered India, its first international market, this year. It has an office in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu. Singh founded the company last year along with Yuri Punj, Sena Palanisami and Ramdas Sunder. Singh had earlier worked with American Express, Cendant, Intel and Booz Allen. Palanisami, who is credited to have set up HP’s software operations in India, is also the founder of San Jose-based ViSolve, the engineering arm of Stoodnt. Punj, an MBA graduate from Harvard Business School, had worked with UBS Investment Bank, JP Morgan Chase, Schroders and M&T Bank in the past. Sunder has worked as a consultant with companies such as McKinsey, Freescale and Pitney Bowes. Besides connecting students, with counsellors and colleges, the platform claims it gives them access to admission insights and admission tools. The company claims it has offered its services to more than 1,000 students so far. As per its website, it has helped students get admitted in world-renowned institutions such as Harvard, Stanford, Yale and Cornell. The services offered include college selection, application, interview preparation, financial aid and visa guidance. The company competes with the likes of mycollegesabroad.com, which provides consulting services to students planning to study abroad, and CollegeDekho, which last year raised funding from Jaipur-based Girnar Software Pvt. Ltd, the company behind auto portal CarDekho and BikeDekho. Stoodnt is among several ed-tech startups that have caught investors’ attention this year. Last week, ed-tech startup Byju’s raised $50 million (Rs 332 crore) in a round co-led by Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, marking the first investment of the philanthropic foundation of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and wife Priscilla Chan in Asia. Prozo.com, an online marketplace for buying and selling study material, recently raised its pre-Series A round of funding from a London-based venture capital firm and two affluent individuals. Last month, ed-tech platform Unacademy raised Rs 6.7 crore from a clutch of investors including Flipkart co-founders Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal and Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma. Among other ed-tech startups, Oliveboard has raised funding from the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation. In late February, ed-tech firm Carveniche Technologies Pvt. Ltd secured angel funding from Calcutta Angels, Lead Angels and a bunch of wealthy individuals. Like this report? Sign up for our daily newsletter to get our top reports.

That can help at times. That said, I've been seeing some artifacts here and there in Edge as well, but they were much more minor than yours.     Cave Waverider View Public Profile Find all posts by Cave Waverider   (#8) PhantomGamers Newbie     Videocard: 2xAMD 7950 3GB 1135/1500 Processor: Intel Corei7 2600k 4.2Ghz Mainboard: GIGABYTE GA-Z68XP-UD4 Memory: DDR3 16GB @ 1600MHz Soundcard: Realtek / AT ADG1 PSU: EVGA P2 1200W Platinum 09-12-2016, 07:49 | posts: 27 | Location: New York, USA I've been getting this in Chrome on Reddit/imgur: Running an EVGA FTW Edition GTX 1080.

Edge also seems more crash-prone and likely to stop responding while loading web pages (though waiting usually resolves this) as well since I updated to build 14393.105.

Several research groups are now using the hugely popular game, which features fast cars and various nefarious activities, to train algorithms that might enable a self-driving car to navigate a real road. There’s little chance of a computer learning bad behavior by playing violent computer games. But the stunningly realistic scenery found in Grand Theft Auto and other virtual worlds could help a machine perceive elements of the real world correctly. A technique known as machine learning is enabling computers to do impressive new things, like identifying faces and recognizing speech as well as a person can. But the approach requires huge quantities of curated data, and it can be challenging and time-consuming to gather enough. The scenery in many games is so fantastically realistic that it can be used to generate data that’s as good as that generated by using real-world imagery. An image from Grand Theft Auto in which different elements have been automatically annotated. Some researchers already build 3-D simulations using game engines to generate training data for their algorithms (see “To Get Truly Smart, AI Might Need to Play More Video Games”). However, off-the-shelf computer games, featuring hours of photorealistic imagery, could provide an easier way to gather large quantities of training data. A team of researchers from Intel Labs and Darmstadt University in Germany has developed a clever way to extract useful training data from Grand Theft Auto. The researchers created a software layer that sits between the game and a computer’s hardware, automatically classifying different objects in the road scenes shown in the game. This provides the labels that can then be fed to a machine-learning algorithm, allowing it to recognize cars, pedestrians, and other objects shown, either in the game or on a real street. According to a paper posted by the team recently, it would be nearly impossible to have people label all of the scenes with similar detail manually. The researchers also say that real training images can be improved with the addition of some synthetic imagery. The software scans a road scene and assigns objects label names (on the left panel) such as road, sidewalk, or building. One of the big challenges in AI is how to slake the thirst for data exhibited by the most powerful machine-learning algorithms. This is especially problematic for real-world tasks like automated driving. It takes thousands of hours to collect real street imagery, and thousands more to label all of those images. It’s also impractical to go through every possible scenario in real life, like crashing a car into a brick wall at a high speed. “Annotating real-world data is an expensive operation and the current approaches do not scale up easily,” says Alireza Shafaei, a PhD student at the University of British Columbia who recently coauthored a paper showing how video games can be used to train a computer vision system, in some cases as well as real data can. Together with Mark Schmidt, an assistant professor at UBC, and Jim Little, a professor at UBC, Shafaei showed that video games also provide an easy way to vary the environmental conditions found in training data. “With artificial environments we can effortlessly gather precisely annotated data at a larger scale with a considerable amount of variation in lighting and climate settings,” Shafaei says. “We showed that this synthetic data is almost as good, or sometimes even better, than using real data for training.” AI researchers already use simple games as a way to test the learning capabilities of their algorithms (see “Google’s AI Masters Space Invaders” and “Minecraft Is a Testing Ground for Human-AI Collaboration”). But there is growing interest in using game scenery to feed algorithms visual training data. A group at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, for instance, is developing a tool that can be used to connect a machine-learning algorithm to any environment built using the popular game engine Unreal. This includes games such as KiteRunner and Hellblade, but also many spectacular architectural visualizations.

Here are three familiar American names that fit the bill. John Rosevear (TMFMarlowe) Sep 11, 2016 at 1:25PM SUVs are booming in China, and the Baojun 560 is a hot seller. Its secret: It benefits from General Motors' deep SUV expertise, because Baojun is a GM brand. Image source: General Motors. Many American investors are intrigued by the investment possibilities offered by China's ongoing economic rise. But they're also daunted: There is a bewildering array of up-and-coming Chinese companies to consider, and getting news on many of them (or at least, news in English) can be a big challenge.  But you don't have to go to China to find companies that are thriving in the booming Chinese market. We asked our Fool contributors to identify three U.S. companies that each have a big presence in China and that are well-positioned to bring home big profits as the Chinese market grows. Here's what they came up with.  Sprinting for growth in the Middle Kingdom Steve Symington: It's hard to find any company with a more attractive runway to bolster its presence in China than Under Armour (NYSE:UA). Last quarter alone, Under Armour's international revenue grew 68% year over year, to just over $150 million. But international sales still represented only around 15% of Under Armour's total. And during Under Armour's subsequent conference call, company founder and CEO Kevin Plank specifically singled out the greater China geography as crucial to implementing Under Armour's global growth strategy, especially amid what he described as "increasing support for sport by the government." Plank also called this quarter an "inflection point for the brand in China" as it begins to ramp its expansion plans in earnest. So far this year, e-commerce revenue from China has already climbed 157%. And when all is said and done in 2016, Under Armour will have opened more than 150 international partner stores this year, with the majority located in China. "We're not as famous as we will be [in China]," Plank stated, "but we're definitely proud, I think, of the inroads that we've made, and the big opportunity in putting stores behind it, putting distribution." But arguably most important to Under Armour's success in China is the fact that its consumers largely view UA as a superior performance footwear brand, with many even regularly referring to it as "the professional brand," according to Plank. To be sure, Under Armour's men's and women's running businesses have each more than doubled from last year. And with the help of two-time NBA MVP (and loyal Under Armour-sponsored athlete) Stephen Curry, the high-end Curry 2 Under Armour basketball shoe has proven the top-selling item in China year to date in 2016. It should come as no surprise, then, that just last week Under Armour took Curry on his second tour of Asia to promote the brand over five days in Shenyang, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Taipei.  So with international revenue still representing such a small slice of Under Armour's total, and with the Middle Kingdom playing a central role in its overseas growth initiatives, I think Under Armour is a perfect stock to profit from the rise of China. No stranger to China Tim Green: International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) has been operating in China for decades, with the first IBM machines installed in the country way back in 1934. IBM China was established in 1936, headquartered in Shanghai, and by 1939 the company counted as customers the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and various other major organizations. The revolution of 1949 complicated matters, but by 1979 the first IBM computer system was installed in the country. As China's economy continues to grow rapidly, IBM is positioned to benefit. One area in particular where IBM could expand its business in China is the market for server CPUs. In an effort to effectively compete against Intel, IBM launched the OpenPOWER foundation in 2013 along with companies like Alphabet's Google and NVIDIA. The goal was to create an ecosystem around IBM's Power processors, creating a viable alternative to Intel in the data center. Part of IBM's plan is to allow third-party companies to build and sell Power servers, as well as custom Power chips. Allowing Chinese companies to design and build custom Power chips could help IBM make inroads into the Chinese server market, given China's push to build up its homegrown tech industry. Advanced Micro Devices is following a similar strategy with its recently announced joint venture in the country. China is a tough market for American technology companies, but IBM's long history and realistic strategy should help the company profit from the country's continued rise. This Rust Belt icon is thriving in China John Rosevear: I think a lot of U.S. investors are dimly aware that Buick is a popular brand in China. But I think a lot of folks miss just how big General Motors' (NYSE:GM) presence in China has become, how well it's positioned to ride the country's growth over the long term -- and why, here in 2016, GM is looking like a very good investment.  China has a slew of domestic automakers, and most of the global giants have a presence there. But GM sells more cars and trucks in China than any manufacturer other than Volkswagen -- and in some years, GM sells more than VW. Both GM and VW have dominant positions in China. But GM is the better bet for investors for a bunch of reasons.  The Buick Excelle GT is one of China's best-selling cars. It's a close cousin of the U.S.-market Buick Verano. But GM's presence in China goes far beyond Buick. Image source: General Motors.  China has become a huge part of GM's global business: Last year, GM and its Chinese joint ventures sold 3.6 million vehicles in China, more than the 3.1 million GM sold here in the U.S. It's on track to sell even more in 2016: Through August, GM's sales in China are up 8% versus the same period last year. That growth isn't likely to stall. GM has the production capacity, the dealer network, the product mix, the local partners, and the on-the-ground expertise to continue to be a leader in the Chinese auto market well into the future.  China doesn't yet contribute as much to GM's bottom line as its wildly profitable North America operation. That's mostly due to product mix: The Chinese still buy more small cars and fewer loaded big SUVs than Americans, though they're buying more SUVs every year. And GM's upscale (and highly profitable) Cadillac brand is growing quickly in the Middle Kingdom. But China already contributes a lot: GM raked in $2.1 billion in equity income from its Chinese joint ventures last year, more than a fifth of its $9.8 billion in net income for 2015. That proportion will rise as Chinese buyers continue to move upscale.  There are a lot of good reasons aside from China to take a closer look at GM shares right now. Even with all of the radical technological changes expected to come to the auto industry over the next few years, GM's low valuation (just over four times trailing-12-month earnings) and fat dividend yield (4.7%) make it a very intriguing stock -- in part because GM is better-positioned to thrive in that technological upheaval than many realize.  Long story short: China is a major part of GM's compelling growth story, and it will be for years to come.

Beauty with a Purpose By William Watterson '15    Tag it: “None of my teachers believed I could get into college,” says Shruti Nagarajan ’14. “My friends laughed. I don’t want anyone to feel that way. I hope that I can be that one person that can tell a young person that they can do it.” Credit Nagarajan, who is originally from the U.S. territory of Guam, won the Miss Rhode Island contest in May with a platform of “Upward Mobility: College Access for Low-Income and Minority Students” and a talent for Bollywood fusion dance. She believes she is the first woman from Guam to participate in the Miss America Pageant.  Nagarajan’s road from Guam to Miss Rhode Island started with a mango tree, ran through Brown, and, she hopes, will lead to a Miss America crown. When Nagarajan was a high school freshman, her mango tree died. “I was very young and very upset that my tree had died. Guam problems.” She laughs. Nagarajan cut the tree open and found that it was hollow. The problem was a borer insect infestation. She devised a novel pest management system that would control the borer population. Her system not only worked but was a finalist at the Intel International Science Fair in 2007. For her college essay, Nagarajan wrote about her mango tree. Brown was one among many colleges she applied to. “From Guam, all U.S. schools sound the same,” says Nagarajan, “and I couldn’t afford to visit.” The Brown admission officers were so taken by her ingenuity in fixing her tree that they wrote her a personalized acceptance letter. This impressed Nagarajan, and in 2010 she arrived on College Hill. Yet it had been only by chance that she’d written about the mango tree. She had no college adviser and neither did her peers, most of whom would never leave Guam, much less attend an American university. When Nagarajan started at Brown she was shocked by how far behind she was. She studied public policy and education because she “wanted to know why [she] was different” and why geography and socioeconomic status affect access to college. After graduation Nagarajan took a job with the investment advising firm Cambridge Associates. She loves it, but started to feel it was taking over her life. Unhappy with herself, having gained weight and lost her self-confidence, Nagarajan decided she needed another positive outlet. She ended up jumping into pageantry after discovering that two Brown women—master's student Alexandra Curtis and Ivy DePew  ’14 MPA—had won the past two Miss Rhode Island pageants. With zero pageant experience, Nagarajan took the leap. Nagarajan wants to use her platform as Miss Rhode Island to boost college acceptance of low-income students. She plans to work with College Visions, a Rhode Island–based nonprofit founded by Simon Moore ’00, which provides advice and resources to low-income and first-generation college-bound students to help them enroll, persist, and graduate. By both publicizing the program and working directly with students as a mentor, Nagarajan aims to make a real difference. Comments (1) 09/23/16   I'm disappointed to see Deborah Saint-Vil '10, who was Miss Rhode Island 2010, not mentioned alongside the other previous winners in this article.

Here are three familiar American names that fit the bill. John Rosevear (TMFMarlowe) Sep 11, 2016 at 1:25PM SUVs are booming in China, and the Baojun 560 is a hot seller. Its secret: It benefits from General Motors' deep SUV expertise, because Baojun is a GM brand. Image source: General Motors. Many American investors are intrigued by the investment possibilities offered by China's ongoing economic rise. But they're also daunted: There is a bewildering array of up-and-coming Chinese companies to consider, and getting news on many of them (or at least, news in English) can be a big challenge.  But you don't have to go to China to find companies that are thriving in the booming Chinese market. We asked our Fool contributors to identify three U.S. companies that each have a big presence in China and that are well-positioned to bring home big profits as the Chinese market grows. Here's what they came up with.  Sprinting for growth in the Middle Kingdom Steve Symington: It's hard to find any company with a more attractive runway to bolster its presence in China than Under Armour (NYSE:UA). Last quarter alone, Under Armour's international revenue grew 68% year over year, to just over $150 million. But international sales still represented only around 15% of Under Armour's total. And during Under Armour's subsequent conference call, company founder and CEO Kevin Plank specifically singled out the greater China geography as crucial to implementing Under Armour's global growth strategy, especially amid what he described as "increasing support for sport by the government." Plank also called this quarter an "inflection point for the brand in China" as it begins to ramp its expansion plans in earnest. So far this year, e-commerce revenue from China has already climbed 157%. And when all is said and done in 2016, Under Armour will have opened more than 150 international partner stores this year, with the majority located in China. "We're not as famous as we will be [in China]," Plank stated, "but we're definitely proud, I think, of the inroads that we've made, and the big opportunity in putting stores behind it, putting distribution." But arguably most important to Under Armour's success in China is the fact that its consumers largely view UA as a superior performance footwear brand, with many even regularly referring to it as "the professional brand," according to Plank. To be sure, Under Armour's men's and women's running businesses have each more than doubled from last year. And with the help of two-time NBA MVP (and loyal Under Armour-sponsored athlete) Stephen Curry, the high-end Curry 2 Under Armour basketball shoe has proven the top-selling item in China year to date in 2016. It should come as no surprise, then, that just last week Under Armour took Curry on his second tour of Asia to promote the brand over five days in Shenyang, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Taipei.  So with international revenue still representing such a small slice of Under Armour's total, and with the Middle Kingdom playing a central role in its overseas growth initiatives, I think Under Armour is a perfect stock to profit from the rise of China. No stranger to China Tim Green: International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) has been operating in China for decades, with the first IBM machines installed in the country way back in 1934. IBM China was established in 1936, headquartered in Shanghai, and by 1939 the company counted as customers the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and various other major organizations. The revolution of 1949 complicated matters, but by 1979 the first IBM computer system was installed in the country. As China's economy continues to grow rapidly, IBM is positioned to benefit. One area in particular where IBM could expand its business in China is the market for server CPUs. In an effort to effectively compete against Intel, IBM launched the OpenPOWER foundation in 2013 along with companies like Alphabet's Google and NVIDIA. The goal was to create an ecosystem around IBM's Power processors, creating a viable alternative to Intel in the data center. Part of IBM's plan is to allow third-party companies to build and sell Power servers, as well as custom Power chips. Allowing Chinese companies to design and build custom Power chips could help IBM make inroads into the Chinese server market, given China's push to build up its homegrown tech industry. Advanced Micro Devices is following a similar strategy with its recently announced joint venture in the country. China is a tough market for American technology companies, but IBM's long history and realistic strategy should help the company profit from the country's continued rise. This Rust Belt icon is thriving in China John Rosevear: I think a lot of U.S. investors are dimly aware that Buick is a popular brand in China. But I think a lot of folks miss just how big General Motors' (NYSE:GM) presence in China has become, how well it's positioned to ride the country's growth over the long term -- and why, here in 2016, GM is looking like a very good investment.  China has a slew of domestic automakers, and most of the global giants have a presence there. But GM sells more cars and trucks in China than any manufacturer other than Volkswagen -- and in some years, GM sells more than VW. Both GM and VW have dominant positions in China. But GM is the better bet for investors for a bunch of reasons.  The Buick Excelle GT is one of China's best-selling cars. It's a close cousin of the U.S.-market Buick Verano. But GM's presence in China goes far beyond Buick. Image source: General Motors.  China has become a huge part of GM's global business: Last year, GM and its Chinese joint ventures sold 3.6 million vehicles in China, more than the 3.1 million GM sold here in the U.S. It's on track to sell even more in 2016: Through August, GM's sales in China are up 8% versus the same period last year. That growth isn't likely to stall. GM has the production capacity, the dealer network, the product mix, the local partners, and the on-the-ground expertise to continue to be a leader in the Chinese auto market well into the future.  China doesn't yet contribute as much to GM's bottom line as its wildly profitable North America operation. That's mostly due to product mix: The Chinese still buy more small cars and fewer loaded big SUVs than Americans, though they're buying more SUVs every year. And GM's upscale (and highly profitable) Cadillac brand is growing quickly in the Middle Kingdom. But China already contributes a lot: GM raked in $2.1 billion in equity income from its Chinese joint ventures last year, more than a fifth of its $9.8 billion in net income for 2015. That proportion will rise as Chinese buyers continue to move upscale.  There are a lot of good reasons aside from China to take a closer look at GM shares right now. Even with all of the radical technological changes expected to come to the auto industry over the next few years, GM's low valuation (just over four times trailing-12-month earnings) and fat dividend yield (4.7%) make it a very intriguing stock -- in part because GM is better-positioned to thrive in that technological upheaval than many realize.  Long story short: China is a major part of GM's compelling growth story, and it will be for years to come.

Does this spell the end for tax-dodging by multinationals? Simon Wilson reports. What exactly is Apple accused of? The European Commission (EC) hasn’t accused Apple itself of breaking any law. And Ireland’s government is content with the amount of corporation tax the firm is paying. The problem is more a case of whether Ireland was right to be satisfied with that. The EC thinks it wasn’t: Margrethe Vestager, the competition commissioner, stunned Apple, Dublin and the US government – all of whom are furious – by ordering the Irish government to recover a mammoth €13bn in back taxes from the tech giant, on the grounds that Apple’s “sweetheart” tax arrangements in Ireland since 1991 amounted to illegal state subsidies under European Union law. Is Vestager right on corporate tax? That will be for the courts to decide, in what most expect to be years of expensive legal wrangling. It is certainly true that Apple, with its superabundance of intellectual property and intangible assets – the kind that are much easier to shift around to game the system – has been a world leader in exploiting the gaps between national tax jurisdictions. The current spat centres on two Irish-registered subsidiaries that hold the right to use Apple intellectual property to make and sell its phones and computers in the world outside the Americas. The EC says that a stitch-up between Apple and Dublin allowed most of the profits to go to a “head office” that only existed on paper, and meant Apple paid tax in Europe of less than 1%. In Ireland itself, it says Apple’s effective tax rate in 2014 was virtually nil (0.005%). What does Ireland say? The government is seething – and worried. Michael Noonan, the finance minister, says the EC demand is “bizarre and outrageous” and that he would rather “defend the integrity of our tax system” than accept a $13bn windfall – a sum that exceeds Ireland’s annual healthcare budget. In effect, Ireland has been accused of being a giant tax haven. That charge has the potential to threaten the country’s entire economic development model, which is unusually dependent of foreign direct investment (it’s second only to Singapore in terms of FDI per capita). Apple first arrived in Cork in 1980, opening a small factory with 60 workers. Now that factory employs 6,000 people; Microsoft, Intel and Pfizer also have substantial operations in the country, and Google and Facebook have their international headquarters in Dublin. There are 700 US companies in Ireland employing 140,000 people (in a country of less than five million). So this is about reputation? Yes. In the case of Ireland, it’s about protecting its reputation as a legitimate low-tax regime in the face of a complex collision between competition law and tax law. In the case of Apple, and similar companies, it’s about trying to keep its profits out of the clutches of the US taxman, where the average combined rate across the various states is 39.1% (compared with Ireland’s 12.5%), while not actually stepping over the legal line. But in a broader context, the Apple/EU case is about the fact that it is getting ever easier for companies to disguise where their profits are being made, and harder for national governments to keep up. The share of corporation tax (as a proportion of overall tax take) has slumped from 32.1% to 8.9% in the US since 1952. In the UK it has fallen from 10% to 6% since 1989. That suggests that companies are getting better at bending the rules – avoiding tax – even if they are sticking to the letter of the law. Can’t they be shamed into paying up? There has been much discussion in recent years about “tax shaming” and tax as a moral issue rather than a legal one. Large numbers of companies that comply with the letter of the law have been accused of not complying with the spirit of it, and found themselves pilloried in the media. It is naturally very frustrating for UK firms who uncomplainingly pay large tax bills – not to mention individual taxpayers – to see multinationals avoid doing so. But again, the power to bring about change lies with policymakers, not business leaders. Companies are accused of acting unethically for taking advantage of tax loopholes, but they might argue that politicians are to blame for permitting those loopholes. What’s a better solution? People and companies should, of course, be ashamed of evading tax, argues Tim Harford in the FT earlier this year, but “a system that is driven by public shaming has gone badly wrong. Shame is an uneven incentive; it may keep celebrities, politicians and consumer brands in line, but less prominent figures and corporations will escape censure.” Moreover, there is more to good tax design than closing loopholes. The long-term solutions surely lie in overall lower tax rates on a broader base within a simplified system and exceptions eliminated – together with multilateral reform of the global tax system of the kind being pursued by the OECD. In the meantime, companies will increasingly have to factor in the “front-page test” when working out how to keep both the taxman and their shareholders happy. Britain’s tough new tax rules It’s not just big business that’s facing a more rigorous approach from policymakers. Britain’s tax professionals – accountants, lawyers and financial advisers – are “firmly in the taxman’s sights”, says Emily Cadman in the Financial Times. Last month HMRC published its long-awaited proposals for a clampdown on professionals who facilitate aggressive tax avoidance. If approved, the new regime will include new punishments for individuals and firms involved in designing, marketing or facilitating avoidance schemes that are later “defeated” by HMRC. Ominously for the avoiders, tax campaigners warmly welcomed the move, while John Cullinane of the Chartered Institute of Taxation warned of the risk from rules that prevented taxpayers “getting access to honest, impartial advice on the law”.

Restaurants Home Nation / World How Pittsburgh became Uber’s testing ground print Share | e-mail Facebook Tweet StumbleUpon Google 2784900 false Jeff Swensen / The New York Times An Uber car drives through Pittsburgh last week to map out the roads and topography before the introduction of the company’s driverless vehicles. Click here to enlarge image Cutting edge How Pittsburgh became Uber’s testing ground By Cecilia Kang / New York Times News Service Published Sep 11, 2016 at 12:02AM PITTSBURGH — Any day now, Uber will introduce a fleet of self-driving cars in Pittsburgh, making this former steel town the world’s first city to let passengers hail autonomous vehicles. So with the world watching, what has the city of 306,000 done to prepare for Uber’s unprecedented test? The answer is not much. There have been no public service announcements or demonstrations of the technology. Except for the mayor and one police official, no other top city leader has seen a self-driving Uber vehicle operate up close. Fire and emergency services don’t know where the Uber cars will travel. It is precisely this hands-off approach that has made Pittsburgh ideal grounds for one of Silicon Valley’s boldest experiments — and it has ignited criticism that the city is giving away its keys to Uber, which is testing a nascent technology and has a reputation for running roughshod over regulators and municipalities. “It’s not our role to throw up regulations or limit companies like Uber,” said Bill Peduto, Pittsburgh’s mayor, who said that Uber planned to use about 100 modified Volvo sport utility vehicles for the passenger trials. The vehicles will also have a human monitor behind the wheel. “You can either put up red tape or roll out the red carpet. If you want to be a 21st-century laboratory for technology, you put out the carpet.” The mayor’s mantra highlights what it takes these days as cities seek to shed their Rust Belt pasts and transform themselves into technology hubs — essentially, give the tech companies lots of free rein. The approach, described as greenlight governing, is one that Pittsburgh and the state of Pennsylvania have nurtured over the last few years. When Uber wanted to expand its research around autonomous vehicles, Pittsburgh helped the company lease a large plot near the city’s riverfront for a testing track. When state regulators tried to ban ride-hailing services in 2014, Pittsburgh’s mayor and the state’s governor helped bat those hurdles down. Otherwise, Pittsburgh’s politicians stay out of the way. The approach has many benefits, allowing Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania to position themselves at the forefront of a driverless-vehicle movement that has swept up tech companies including automakers, Google and Baidu of China. It has brought tech entrepreneurs to Pittsburgh and attracted hundreds of scientists and engineers to new research centers opened in the city in the last decade by Apple, Google, Intel and Uber. But it also has invited criticism from those who say Pittsburgh is giving too much power to tech companies, all for a sheen of innovation. Some residents are on edge about Uber’s self-driving vehicles and complain that they have been thrust into an experiment with potential safety risks. “I feel like we were pushed into being part of this by the city,” said Montana Michniak, a recent college graduate who works at a cafe in the city’s South Side neighborhood. How Pittsburgh handles the unveiling of Uber’s self-driving fleet is being closely watched by other tech and auto companies that are doing their own driverless experiments in places like California and Michigan (although Apple is said to have laid off dozens of employees in its self-driving car project and to be rethinking its strategy). Depressed cities around the nation are watching to see if the Pittsburgh story can be a blueprint for their own transitions into tech hubs. “This is the first mayor in Pittsburgh to really get it, and that’s a big reason why the city has become the best case of Rust Belt revival,” said Richard Florida, a professor of urban studies at the University of Toronto, who previously taught at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. He said he was “frankly surprised at how long a leash” Uber got. Peduto said Uber did not have too much power in Pittsburgh and that the city would be safe because there would be a human monitor in the Uber test cars. The mayor also has his eye on a bigger safety goal. “There is no technology that is fail-proof, and there is no tech that can guarantee there won’t be accidents, but right now there are 3,287 people who die in automobile-related accidents around the world each day, and there has to be a better way,” he said. In a statement, Uber said of Pittsburgh, “Our work would not be possible without the support we’ve received from city leaders.” Uber came to Pittsburgh in early 2015, drawn by the engineering talent at Carnegie Mellon. The university started a robotics department 30 years ago, when driverless cars seemed like a fantasy, but robotics has since proved crucial for the systems that let vehicles navigate streets on their own. By this decade, the university’s expertise in computer science had attracted not only Uber but also General Motors, Google and Intel, some of which embedded at Carnegie Mellon. Google and Uber later opened research centers, hiring dozens of Carnegie Mellon professors and graduate students. Today, Uber has 500 employees at a center in Pittsburgh’s industrial Strip District working on autonomous vehicles, according to Peduto. Uber will have 1,000 employees at the site, known as the Advanced Technology Center, within a few years and plans to increase investments to $1 billion from hundreds of millions of dollars in a decade, he said. For driverless car tests, Pennsylvania also held a legal advantage. Specifically, the state’s transportation rules did not explicitly ban driverless cars, as long as someone was behind the wheel to take over if needed. Officials from Pennsylvania’s transportation agency said they interpreted that silence on driverless technology as a green light. Some state officials said they also believed that driverless cars could be safer than those steered by drivers, helping avoid driver-related deaths. “We’d be committing governmental malpractice if we didn’t pursue this technology,” said Roger Cohen, the policy director of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. In Pittsburgh, Peduto fostered a close relationship with Uber. In Peduto’s first meeting in early 2015 with Uber’s chief executive, Travis Kalanick, Kalanick said he had noticed efforts by Peduto and other officials to fight the state public utilities commission’s proposed ban on ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft in 2014. Kalanick also laid out a plan for Uber’s driverless cars. “Travis’ vision was to build out the autonomous vehicles industry in 10 years,” Peduto said. “We shared a vision to do it in a way that would be a benefit for society.” Weeks later, in a meeting with President Barack Obama at a conference for the National League of Cities, Peduto urged Obama to support autonomous vehicles and declared Pittsburgh’s intention to be a testing ground. Since then, Pittsburgh has showed its friendliness to Uber’s efforts. Last year, it also worked with the city’s police department on plans to install a ride-hailing kiosk in the lively South Side district, for the use of people who had been drinking and would prefer not to drive home. Pittsburgh International Airport last year also designated waiting areas for Uber and Lyft passengers. Yet Uber has mostly gone ahead with its self-driving-car plans in Pittsburgh alone. Driverless cars with Uber’s logo have cruised around town for months, in part to get the public used to seeing them. With cameras and GPS units mounted on the roofs, the vehicles collect mapping data on plants and trees, the conditions of sidewalks, and traffic markings for nearly every street. “There’s really not been a whole lot of collaboration on the actual testing,” said Scott Schuster, Pittsburgh’s assistant chief of police, who rode in one of the Uber vehicles last June and signed a nondisclosure agreement to do so. 15014590 View next article in Nation & World     Get Central Oregon's top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning GO print version Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus This image is copyrighted.

With the potential for interest rate increases, a sure to be intense final 60 days to the presidential election, and typical seasonal volatility, caution may be the best avenue for now. For growth investors with a longer term time horizon, one well to go to is large cap technology, especially the companies that also pay solid dividends. We screened the research universe at Merrill Lynch looking for large cap technology leaders that pay dividends. We found four rated Buy that make good sense now. HP This is the printer and personal computer businesses of the old Hewlett-Packard. HP Inc. (NYSE: HPQ) provides products, technologies, software, solutions and services to individual consumers and small- and medium-sized businesses, as well as to the government, health and education sectors worldwide. The company’s Personal Systems segment offers commercial personal computers (PCs), consumer PCs, workstations, thin client PCs, tablets, retail point-of-sale systems, calculators and other related accessories, software, support and services for the commercial and consumer markets. The Printing segment provides consumer and commercial printer hardware, supplies, media, scanning device and software and services, as well as LaserJet and enterprise, inkjet and printing, graphics, and software and web services. HP investors receive a 3.4% dividend. The Merrill Lynch price target for the stock is $15, and the Wall Street consensus estimate is $15.54. The shares closed Tuesday at $14.63. Intel This leader in semiconductors is working hard to scale away from dependence on personal computers. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) designs, manufactures and sells integrated digital technology platforms worldwide. The company’s platforms are used in various computing applications comprising notebooks, two-in-one systems, desktops, servers, tablets, smartphones, wireless and wired connectivity products, wearables, retail devices and manufacturing devices, as well as for retail, transportation, industrial, buildings, home use and other market segments. The company also provides communication and connectivity offerings, such as baseband processors, radio frequency transceivers and power management integrated circuits, and tablet, phone and Internet of Things solutions, which include multimode 4G LTE modems, Bluetooth technology and GPS receivers, software solutions and interoperability tests, as well as home gateway and set-top box components. Intel reported an inline second quarter, but data center sales came in way below expectations. But a new partnership with Microsoft for a virtual reality, as well as a consistent shift away for reliance on chips for personal computers, keeps the stock a compelling buy. Intel investors receive a 2.85% dividend. The $42 Merrill Lynch price target compares with the consensus target of $37.58. The shares closed Tuesday at $36.57.

How Pittsburgh Became Uber’s Testing Ground By CECILIA KANGSEPT. 10, 2016 Continue reading the main story Share This Page Continue reading the main story Photo Uber cars prepare to roll through Pittsburgh to map out the roads and topography before the introduction of the company’s driverless vehicles. Credit Jeff Swensen for The New York Times PITTSBURGH — Any day now, Uber will introduce a fleet of self-driving cars in Pittsburgh, making this former steel town the world’s first city to let any passenger hail an autonomous vehicle. So with the world watching, what has the city of 306,000 done to prepare for Uber’s unprecedented test? The answer is not much. There have been no public service announcements or demonstrations of the technology. Except for the mayor and one police official, no other top city leader has seen a self-driving Uber vehicle operate up close. Fire and emergency services don’t know where the Uber cars will travel. It is precisely this hands-off approach that has made Pittsburgh ideal grounds for one of Silicon Valley’s boldest experiments — and it has ignited criticism that the city is giving away its keys to Uber, which is testing a nascent technology and has a reputation for running roughshod over regulators and municipalities. Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story “It’s not our role to throw up regulations or limit companies like Uber,” said Bill Peduto, Pittsburgh’s mayor, who said that Uber planned to use about 100 modified Volvo sport utility vehicles for the passenger trials. The vehicles will also have a human monitor behind the wheel. “You can either put up red tape or roll out the red carpet. If you want to be a 21st-century laboratory for technology, you put out the carpet.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story The mayor’s mantra highlights what it takes these days as cities seek to shed their Rust Belt pasts and transform themselves into technology hubs — essentially, give the tech companies lots of free rein. The approach, described as greenlight governing, is one that Pittsburgh and the state of Pennsylvania have nurtured over the last few years. When Uber wanted to expand its research around autonomous vehicles, Pittsburgh helped the company lease a large plot near the city’s riverfront for a testing track. When state regulators tried to ban ride-sharing services in 2014, Pittsburgh’s mayor and the state’s governor helped bat those hurdles down. Otherwise, Pittsburgh’s politicians stay out of the way. Photo Mayor Bill Peduto has worked with Uber to allow access to test its vehicles on Pittsburgh streets. “You can either put up red tape or roll out the red carpet,” he said. Credit Jeff Swensen for The New York Times The approach has many benefits, allowing Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania to position themselves at the forefront of a driverless-vehicle movement that has swept up tech companies including automakers, Google and Baidu of China. It has brought tech entrepreneurs to Pittsburgh and attracted hundreds of scientists and engineers to new research centers opened in the city in the last decade by Apple, Google, Intel and Uber. But it also has invited criticism from those who say Pittsburgh is giving too much power to tech companies, all for a sheen of innovation. Some residents are on edge about Uber’s self-driving vehicles and complain that they have been thrust into an experiment with potential safety risks. “I feel like we were pushed into being part of this by the city,” said Montana Michniak, a recent college graduate who works at a cafe in the city’s South Side neighborhood. How Pittsburgh handles the unveiling of Uber’s self-driving fleet is being closely watched by other tech and auto companies that are doing their own driverless experiments in places like California and Michigan (although Apple is said to have laid off dozens of employees in its self-driving car project and to be rethinking its strategy). Depressed cities around the nation are watching to see if the Pittsburgh story can be a blueprint for their own transitions into tech hubs. “This is the first mayor in Pittsburgh to really get it, and that’s a big reason why the city has become the best case of Rust Belt revival,” said Richard Florida, a professor of urban studies at the University of Toronto, who previously taught at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. He said he was “frankly surprised at how long a leash” Uber got. Mr. Peduto said Uber did not have too much power in Pittsburgh and said the city would be safe because there would be a human monitor in the Uber test cars. The mayor also has his eye on a bigger safety goal.

Driverless cars with Uber’s logo have cruised around town for months, in part to get the public used to seeing them. With cameras and GPS units mounted on the roofs, the vehicles collect mapping data on plants and trees, the conditions of sidewalks, and traffic markings for nearly every street. “There’s really not been a whole lot of collaboration on the actual testing,” said Scott Schubert, Pittsburgh’s assistant chief of police, who rode in one of the Uber vehicles last June and signed a nondisclosure agreement to do so. Last month, Uber officially announced that the self-driving fleet would go into action in Pittsburgh. Mr. Peduto, who had been informed a few days earlier by Uber, sent a congratulatory text message to Mr. Kalanick. Uber’s chief was in Pittsburgh at the time and invited the mayor to be the city’s first driverless-car passenger. After the two-mile ride home, Mr. Peduto posted on Twitter that he ended that day as the world’s first mayor chauffeured by an autonomous Uber car. “I feel fortunate that I have the ear of a C.E.O. of one of the biggest privately held companies,” he said. Correction: September 14, 2016 An article on Sunday about Uber’s introduction of self-driving cars to Pittsburgh misstated the surname of the city’s assistant chief of police. He is Scott Schubert, not Schuster. Kitty Bennett contributed research. A version of this article appears in print on September 11, 2016, on page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: No Driver? Bring It On. How Pittsburgh Became Uber’s Test City.

Technology 1 0 0 September 10, 2016 MacBook Pro Update: Has Apple’s High-End Notebook Been Delayed Until 2017? Daryl Deino People have been patiently awaiting a major upgrade for the MacBook Pro since 2013. Now, there are some people who are fearing that Apple’s latest notebook may not arrive until 2017. This is because it is rumored that Apple wants to use the latest Intel Kaby Lake processors, which won’t be widely available until the very end of 2016. However, Macworld UK, a site that originally thought the new MacBook Pro would be announced in September, says that the MacBook Pro could be announced in October. Is Apple’s new MacBook Pro really coming out in 2016? [Image via Daryl Deino] “Instead, we’re expecting the MacBook Pro to be announced in October, alongside an upcoming iPad. We had originally thought that the theory was backed up by the lack of a MacOS Sierra release date, but following the event we discovered that Apple has quietly announced that the new operating system is coming this month.” Bloomberg was the first site to announce the new MacBook Pro last month. “Apple Inc. is preparing the first significant overhaul of its MacBook Pro laptop line in over four years, according to people familiar with the matter, using one of its older products to help reverse two quarters of sliding sales.” The article added that the updated notebooks would be thinner, include a touchscreen strip, and contain more powerful and efficient graphics processors. At the time, Bloomberg claimed the new notebooks had been in advanced testing since early this year and were expected to be released during the fourth quarter. An article from iTech Post asks if the new MacBook Pro really is coming out this year. “Apple made no announcement about the highly rumored MacBook Pro 2016 at the September 7 event and while this might be disappointing for some, it could actually be good news for others,” says columnist Victor Thompson, who adds that the delayed announcement could mean Apple is waiting to build their new top-line notebooks with Kaby Lake processors. There is a lot of excitement for the new MacBook Pro on Twitter. I'm normally excited for #AppleEvent and new iPhones but 7 does nothing for me. Would like to see a new MacBook Pro soon ! — Jordan McGurk (@jordan210) September 7, 2016 The only features I want to see are those of a 2016 Macbook Pro. #AppleEvent — ~twino~ (@TwinoEmma) September 7, 2016 The new MacBook Pro couldn’t come at a more important time for Apple, which has been seeing a sales decline of all its products. As the Telegraph recently pointed out, Apple’s profits have fallen for the second consecutive quarter. Many people believe that Tim Cook lacks the creative vision that Steve Jobs had. [Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images] “On Tuesday night, the company reported a 27 percent decline in quarterly profits and a slide in revenue, as it struggled to boost sales of the iPhone almost 10 years after it was released,” the article claimed. The Telegraph piece added that Apple also predicts sales would fall in the next quarter and that this has presented the biggest challenge to CEO Tim Cook since Steve Jobs died five years ago. An opinion piece at Tech Times recently indicated that Tim Cook really “needs to go.” “As soon as he assumed his position at the helm of the company, Cook was met with skepticism. He had huge shoes to fill, as late Apple co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs was viewed as an iconic figure, a visionary and a true leader.” The article reminded readers that when Cook took over, most industry experts and analysts questioned whether he’d be up for the part and it ends up that he wasn’t. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus announcement this week has led to more people thinking that Cook really isn’t innovative. However, Apple doesn’t have the same problems Samsung is having — devices that are actually blowing up on people. It would be unwise to ever count Apple out, especially since the Cupertino company has made so many comebacks before.

Getty Images Customers use Samsung Gear VR during Charlotte Tilbury x Samsung at 837 Washington on September 10, 2016 in New York City. By Sara Bauknecht / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette NEW YORK — No invitation? No problem. Several designers have moved their New York Fashion Week events from behind the velvet rope and into the streets for the public to enjoy. The shows continue through Thursday, Rebecca Minkoff had the most literal sidewalk catwalk, blocking off the street in front of her Soho store for a runway show on a steamy Saturday afternoon. Near the seated viewing area for VIPs, pedestrians took in the sights and snapped a few photos as they passed by. Afterward, everyone was invited inside to shop the collection just seen on the runway. The list goes on: Tommy Hilfiger, Gypsy Sport, Timo Weiland, Charlotte Tilbury and Kendall + Kylie (the lifestyle line by Kendall and Kylie Jenner) also opened their events to those beyond the usual fashion editors, store buyers, bloggers and celebrities. While Hilfiger’s TommyXGigi collection was unveiled during a carnival at the South Street Seaport, the others held presentations and launch parties at Samsung 837, a multilevel event space in the Meatpacking District outfitted with Samsung gadgets, a virtual reality tunnel and a three-story screen. People sign up to attend on the Samsung website. Fashion week pop-up storefronts are also a hit. Instead of previewing trends that won't be available in stores for several months, more designers are offering see now/​buy now or in-season collections at temporary shops. The Shop at NYFW in the Meatpacking District had a Maybelline makeup giveaway wall, an artist painting cosmetics bags and some trippy fashion and technology-inspired installations by Intel. Another shop, F.Y.I. @ MADE New York a few blocks away, sold straight-off-the-runway selections. To further democratize the New York Fashion Week experience, a number of brands unveiled collections on social media. Some designers streamed shows via Facebook or on their websites. Misha Nonoo’s social platform of choice was Snapchat, where she premiered the look book for her shop-now collection on lifestyle website Refinery29’s account.

Despite some pushback from residents, the city’s mayor, the police chief, and the Pennsylvania state government are all in favor of the city’s bid to become a center of autonomous vehicle development, according to The New York Times. “You can either put up red tape or roll out the red carpet. If you want to be a 21st-century laboratory for technology, you put out the carpet,” said Pittsburgh’s mayor Bill Peduto. Related: Uber buys Otto, will debut Volvo self-driving cars in Pittsburgh Uber has responded to the city’s open-armed offer and plans to test 100 modified Volvo XC90s in the city. Some Uber riders will be picked up by Uber cars with self-driving technology. The rides will be assigned randomly but riders will be able to opt for a normal Uber car if they prefer. The Volvos equipped with self-driving tech won’t actually be human-free, but will be supervised by two people in the front seats, one to monitor the driving and take over if necessary and the other to observe and record data. Pittsburgh used to be a steel town, but that industry has largely left, and Mayor Peduto views technology companies as a chance to boost the economy. If tech companies are attracted to the city they’ll bring investment and jobs. “It’s not our role to throw up regulations or limit companies like Uber,” Peduto said. Pittsburgh helped Uber find land for a test track for autonomous cars, and the mayor and the state governor both helped stave off a proposed state-wide ban on ridesharing. For the most part, however, the politicians and regulators stay out of the way. Related: Uber’s self-driving Ford Fusion hybrids are cruising around the streets of Pittsburgh This optimistic laissez-faire approach has attracted research and testing centers by Apple, Google, Intel, Uber, Baidu, and car companies. Meanwhile, other cities left behind economically are watching what’s happening as Pittsburgh converts to a tech hub. According to Richard Florida, urban studies professor at the University of Toronto, “This is the first mayor in Pittsburgh to really get it, and that’s a big reason why the city has become the best case of Rust Belt revival.” At the same time, however, Florida also noted he was “frankly surprised at how long a leash” the city gave Uber. Part of Pittsburgh’s draw is Carnegie Mellon University’s robotics department, which started in the 1980s. Robotics expertise is crucial in the development of autonomous cars. When General Motors, Intel, Google, and Uber all opened research centers, in some cases embedded within Carnegie Mellon, Pittsburgh’s tech hub rep started expanding from its own momentum. Pittsburgh’s growth as a self-driving tech hub is helped by the belief at both local and state levels that driverless cars will be safer than human-driven cars. Roger Cohen, Pennsylvania Department of Transportation policy director said, “We’d be committing governmental malpractice if we didn’t pursue this technology.” Mayor Peduto is on-board as well. “There is no technology that is fail-proof and there is no tech that can guarantee there won’t be accidents, but right now there are 3,287 people who die in automobile-related accidents around the world each day, and there has to be a better way,” Peduto said.

ALSO READ Apple ends 51-Q growth streak Ireland backs appeal against EU Apple tax ruling EU orders Apple to pay up to 13 billion euros tax to Ireland Ireland to join Apple in fight against EU tax ruling US steps up fight against EU tax crackdown on Apple When European officials ordered Ireland to collect a record $14.5 billion in back taxes from Apple, Kieran O'Connell drew up a wish list for spending the money. A public social worker who deals with at-risk youth, O'Connell has faced drastic cuts since the Irish government imposed austerity measures six years ago during a financial crisis. His salary was frozen and his pension taxed. With his agency's budget shrunk 30 per cent, he hasn't been able to replace staff, keep up with the demand for addiction and retraining programs or accommodate all the homeless teenagers looking for shelter. "You could invest it in treatment centres, detox beds and community care," said O'Connell, 50, who works in this southern Irish city, where Apple has had its European headquarters for more than 35 years. But Ireland doesn't want Apple's billions. Instead, the Irish government is appealing Europe's tax ruling, a move that is exposing a rift in a country still feeling the aftershocks from years of harsh cutbacks. The Irish government's defence is a mixture of financial realpolitik, national pride and damage limitation. The European Union's decision takes direct aim at some of the country's generous tax policies, calling them illegal incentives in Apple's case. Local lawmakers, in part, worry that taking the tech giant's billions could scare off other multinationals from investing in Ireland just as other countries vie to entice them. Many people across the country are also upset that European officials are meddling with the country's tax policies. Apple, which is also appealing, is taking the same stand, calling the case "politically motivated." But it is a big payday to forgo, prompting criticism from left-wing lawmakers, government workers and even some local fans of Apple. European officials calculate that Apple's tax bill may rise to $21.3 billion when interest is included. The money would go a long way toward funding hospitals, schools and other social programs. At the height of austerity, Ireland cut government salaries by double-digit percentages, halted investment in public works and introduced a series of new taxes. In Cork, unemployment still hovers around 8 per cent, or roughly the national average, after reaching highs of about 15 per cent. Many young people still must emigrate in search of jobs. "That money could create at least 100,000 jobs," said Mick Barry, a Cork lawmaker from the Anti-Austerity Alliance, a small political party. "It would have a transformative effect." This tug of war over Apple's money is part of a broader identity crisis in Ireland since the downturn. Much of the country's long-term economic growth has been tied to attracting international companies through low taxes and flexible working conditions. Almost 200,000 Irish workers, or roughly 10 per cent of the total work force, are now employed by overseas companies, according to government statistics. And Ireland is hoping to entice even more. Countries around the region are lining up to woo companies thinking about leaving Britain after it voted in June to leave the European Union. While the Irish are eager for the jobs offered by international companies, years of belt-tightening are highlighting the yawning inequalities of policies that allow the world's richest companies to sidestep billions in taxes. The improving economy only adds to the debate. Ireland has roared back from recession, but much of the recent growth is related to financial manoeuvring and not longstanding improvements in the domestic economy. "A lot of people don't have a problem with government's appeal, but where were they during the financial crisis when Irish workers could have done with the same help?" said Declan Connolly, 39, an information technology worker for Cork's local government. Almost a third of his colleagues have either been let go or not been replaced when they retired. Extra taxes on his income and pension have left him with roughly 10 per cent less cash in his pocket. "The Irish government never did do as much for us as they are now doing for Apple," Connolly added. Apple's chief executive, Timothy D Cook, has been quick to defend the company's tax practices. "When you're accused of doing something that is so foreign to your values, it brings out outrage in you," he said in an interview with the Irish broadcaster RTE. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on the case. Cork, with a population of about 125,000, is a contradictory blend of Silicon Valley chic and Irish-style austerity. A Starbucks in a refurbished 19th-century building on the banks of the River Lee, which meanders though the city centre, attracts a techie crowd of 20-something millennials, speaking languages as varied as Chinese and Czech. High-end stores like Tommy Hilfiger line the main thoroughfare, and luxury sedans carry tech and pharmaceutical executives to meetings. Yet only a few blocks away, where street stall vendors once sold fruit and vegetables, pawnshops and mostly empty casinos dot the streets. Posters at a government agency offer tips on how to deal with spiralling personal debt. A longtime port town, Cork in recent decades has made itself an attractive hub for multinationals. Companies can tap into a steady stream of graduates from the local university, along with lucrative tax breaks on any research and development carried out in the city. Rents are roughly half those in Dublin. Apple was at the leading edge of this movement, putting down roots in the early 1980s, when the company was a mere minnow in the tech world. Three decades on, Cork's suburbs are littered with newly built office parks, where glass-fronted buildings are emblazoned with logos from some of the world's largest companies, like Dell Technologies, Intel and Eli Lilly and Company. Apple, with its fortresslike compound, is one of the area's largest employers. Its army of over 5,000 workers has been a boon for the local economy, pumping in millions of dollars through income tax, rents and spending at fashionable restaurants and luxury stores. When Apple arrived, its workers mostly assembled computers and other devices. But as labour costs sent production to Asia, the company's Cork offices have now switched gears, mostly providing global customer and sales support. "Cork and Apple have stuck together through thick and thin," said Des Cahill, the city's mayor, who will meet company executives in San Francisco this week as part of an annual trade visit to drum up new investment. "We're like an old married couple." Just a few minutes' walk from Apple's main campus, Cork shows a different side. Austere concrete government housing stands crumbling in the late-summer sun. And social workers say many local residents stand little chance of landing well-paying jobs at Apple, mostly because of a lack of high-tech skills. In Cork's poorest neighbourhoods, austerity has meant layoffs, economic uncertainty and often little support. The number of people living on the streets jumped to 345 last year compared with just 38 in 2011, according to Cork Simon, a local homeless charity. The city's annual budget has been cut by 20 percent, to $170 million, over the same period. For Charlie Harrington, a paramedic, the Apple tax standoff comes down to fairness. Like most people in Cork, Harrington, 53, said international companies - and the jobs they created - were more than welcome in the city. But he doesn't think tax rules are equally applied. When he recently refused to pay a new property tax, authorities took the money directly from his paycheck. If the government was so quick to penalise his small-scale tax avoidance, Harrington asked, then how could it protect Apple? "If the big guys don't pay and the government helps them, then everyone else will ask why we are paying too," he said over a cup of tea in a living room decorated with family photos. "They owe the money, so they should just pay it." ©2016 The New York Times News Service WHY APPLE TAX MONEY IS IMPORTANT TO IRELAND European officials calculate that Apple's tax bill may rise to $21.3 billion, when interest is included The money would go a long way toward funding hospitals, schools and other social programs At the height of austerity, Ireland cut government salaries by double-digit percentages, halted investment in public works In Cork, unemployment still hovers around 8 per cent, or roughly the national average, after reaching highs of about 15 per cent Read More On Apple | Kieran O’connell | Ireland | International | Companies PREVIOUS STORY NEXT STORY RECOMMENDED FOR YOU Advertisements Punto Evo - With Cash Benefits upto ? 60,000.

"You could invest it in treatment centres, detox beds and community care," said O'Connell, 50, who works in this southern Irish city, where Apple has had its European headquarters for more than 35 years. But Ireland doesn't want Apple's billions. Instead, the Irish government is appealing Europe's tax ruling, a move that is exposing a rift in a country still feeling the aftershocks from years of harsh cutbacks. The Irish government's defence is a mixture of financial realpolitik, national pride and damage limitation. The European Union's decision takes direct aim at some of the country's generous tax policies, calling them illegal incentives in Apple's case. Local lawmakers, in part, worry that taking the tech giant's billions could scare off other multinationals from investing in Ireland just as other countries vie to entice them. Many people across the country are also upset that European officials are meddling with the country's tax policies. Apple, which is also appealing, is taking the same stand, calling the case "politically motivated." But it is a big payday to forgo, prompting criticism from left-wing lawmakers, government workers and even some local fans of Apple. European officials calculate that Apple's tax bill may rise to $21.3 billion when interest is included. The money would go a long way toward funding hospitals, schools and other social programs. At the height of austerity, Ireland cut government salaries by double-digit percentages, halted investment in public works and introduced a series of new taxes. In Cork, unemployment still hovers around 8 per cent, or roughly the national average, after reaching highs of about 15 per cent. Many young people still must emigrate in search of jobs. "That money could create at least 100,000 jobs," said Mick Barry, a Cork lawmaker from the Anti-Austerity Alliance, a small political party. "It would have a transformative effect." This tug of war over Apple's money is part of a broader identity crisis in Ireland since the downturn. Much of the country's long-term economic growth has been tied to attracting international companies through low taxes and flexible working conditions. Almost 200,000 Irish workers, or roughly 10 per cent of the total work force, are now employed by overseas companies, according to government statistics. And Ireland is hoping to entice even more. Countries around the region are lining up to woo companies thinking about leaving Britain after it voted in June to leave the European Union. While the Irish are eager for the jobs offered by international companies, years of belt-tightening are highlighting the yawning inequalities of policies that allow the world's richest companies to sidestep billions in taxes. The improving economy only adds to the debate. Ireland has roared back from recession, but much of the recent growth is related to financial manoeuvring and not longstanding improvements in the domestic economy. "A lot of people don't have a problem with government's appeal, but where were they during the financial crisis when Irish workers could have done with the same help?" said Declan Connolly, 39, an information technology worker for Cork's local government. Almost a third of his colleagues have either been let go or not been replaced when they retired. Extra taxes on his income and pension have left him with roughly 10 per cent less cash in his pocket. "The Irish government never did do as much for us as they are now doing for Apple," Connolly added. Apple's chief executive, Timothy D Cook, has been quick to defend the company's tax practices. "When you're accused of doing something that is so foreign to your values, it brings out outrage in you," he said in an interview with the Irish broadcaster RTE.

A public social worker who deals with at-risk youth, O'Connell has faced drastic cuts since the Irish government imposed austerity measures six years ago during a financial crisis.

Woodvine on September 12th, 2016 at 8:01 AM 1 of 4 2 of 4 The worldwide media speculation about the iPhone 7 shows that five years after Steve Jobs’ passing in October 2011, Apple Inc.’s product launches retain much of the allure that Jobs's wizardry as CEO invested them with. It was amazing to see that in the hours leading up to the September 7 launch of the iPhone 7, the top trending item on the website of the New York Times was speculation as to whether or not Apple was dropping the 3.5-millimetre headphone jack from its flagship device. One could even speculate that as greatly insane as the leaders of North Korea may be, they still carefully scheduled their latest nuclear test not to coincide with one of Apple’s “insanely great” media-hogging product launches. The only thing that’s changed is, uh… As one pundit put it however, the launch of the iPhone 7 (sans headphone jack) was a far cry from the “insanely great” launches of Steve Jobs. The two hour event saw Apple roll out incremental upgrades of two of its products: the iPhone and the Apple Watch. There wasn’t a major new product to be seen. The closest things to news—the only things really—that the media could wring out of the event were that Apple dropped the 3.5-mllimetre headphone jack (something that had been expected for months) and that the company was coming out with expensive wireless earbuds called “Airpods”. The iPhone 7 event highlighted the sharp differences between the second Steve Jobs era of Apple—which was about leading the market with seemingly revolutionary new products—and the Apple of current CEO Tim Cook, which is far more about evolving existing product lines and following the market with Apple versions of existing product categories. There was nothing fundamentally new or groundbreaking about last year’s Apple Watch and there’s certainly nothing very new about wireless earbuds. There are already plenty of the latter on the market and Apple’s plans for its wireless earbuds have been one of the notoriously secretive company’s worst-kept secrets for years. The ones you’ve been waiting for Drawings from Apple's 2012 patent for a magnetically "detachable wireless listening device". Apple has been sitting on U.S. Patent No. 9,277,309 for a magnetically “detachable wireless listening device” since October 2012, and, in July 2016, MacRumours convincingly showed that Apple was behind a trademark application for the term “Airpod”, ostensibly filed by Entertainment in Flight LLC (an Apple shell company) in October 2015. The drawings accompanying Apple’s 2012 patent application show earbuds sensibly connected to each other by an under-the-chin cord but speculation (accurate, as it turned out) was that the iPhone 7 Airpods would be, to quote SlashGear, “completely wireless, without a cord to even connect the two earpieces”. Mighty small No, not in the storm drain! Airpods look a lot like the original iPod earbuds without the foam covers or wires. Those original iPod earbuds, I recall, were quite prone to popping out of one’s ears. The newer-style earbuds with the soft silicon tips are much better at staying put but they can still can pop out unexpectedly. If both buds weren’t connected to a cord, I’m sure I’d lose plenty of them—especially in the dark. As for the Airpods, a writer with the Guardian newspaper gloriously and dismissively compared the them to a tampon without the string. I was instantly reminded of the mittens that I had as a small child in Saskatchewan. Like traditional earbuds, these mittens were also joined by a long string, threaded up one sleeve of my parka, across my back and out the other sleeve. Thanks to that annoying cord I couldn’t loose those mitts for trying—though I certainly longed to lose that cord. When I did finally outgrow this tyrannical symbol of childhood, I gained the freedom to…well, lose at least one glove or mitten every winter. Decent mittens can be had for $15 or less, though. Apple’s Airpods are expected to cost about US$159. There’s no word if Apple will sell single side replacements. Apple has old written all over it People may have forgotten just how prolifically Apple came out with really new stuff during the 13 years that Steve Jobs was the company’s CEO, between 1998 and 2010. Before Jobs was forced by failing health to step down as Apple’s CEO on August 24, 2011, the company released at least one new major product every year—iMacs, the iBook, OS X, iPods, iTunes, the switch to Intel processors, the MacBook Pro, the iPhone, Apple TV, the MacBook Air, iPad, and Time Capsule, just to name the highlights. In the subsequent five years under CEO Tim Cook Apple has not released five new products—arguably, it has only released one, the Apple Watch, along with many new generations of existing products. I’m not going to say that the magic has left the Apple headquarters at 1 Infinite Loop, in Cupertino, California (I don’t believe that Steve Jobs ever indulged in magical thinking) but compared to the frantic pace that Jobs maintained, it looks as though Apple has largely been living off the success of its established product lines, especially the iPhone. No consumer technology company, particularly not one so known for innovation, can afford to rest on its laurels like this—not for five years. It has a way of catching up with a company, as it arguably has with Apple. In Apple’s third quarter results for 2016 the company reported declining sales for each of its hardware lines; the second straight quarter of such declines. Year-on-year, the numbers sold of iPhones dropped 15 percent; Macs, 11 percent; and iPads, 9 percent. Apple doesn’t break out sales of the Apple Watch but computer industry analyst IDC estimated in July that Apple Watch sales had fallen 55 percent in 12 months. At US$42.4 billion, Apple’s revenue was down 15 percent year-on-year—the first such decline for the company in 13 years. It’s hard to believe that the iPhone 7 will be enough to lift Apple out of its sales doldrums. The loss of the headphone jack may not discourage existing iPhone users from upgrading but it’s also not much of an incentive either. There’s also the apparently growing problem of the iPhone 6 “touch disease” that can suddenly render the screen (and thus the phone) unusable. This is a sort of sequel to the earlier “bendgate” problem of 2014, which saw hundreds of first generation iPhone 6 models break from flexing in users' pockets. Apple ultimately fixed that problem by replacing broken phones and by reinforcing weak points in the design. The new problem is likewise blamed on Apple’s engineering choices to slim down the phone and is reportedly accounting for some 11 percent of Apple Store iPhone service traffic and has already led to some lawsuits. This latest problem with the iPhone 6 could become a large media story just as the iPhone 7 actually goes on sale. Apple really needs new and compelling products (in addition to updates of existing products). It needs them to keep its aura of being an innovative leader; it needs them to focus consumers and investors on the company’s future, rather than on any of its past stumbles. And of course it needs them to keep making money. Apple clearly thinks different than it used to Steve Jobs practised this strategy of the “new thing” aggressively and successfully for 13 years. And he carefully evolved his existing product line. Jobs worked to maintain a corporate culture with enough of a hungry startup mentality to keep Apple from turning into a slow, stodgy old thing like HP. The current CEO, Tim Cook, was Steve Jobs’ hand-picked successor. It’s hard to fathom, but under Cook’s leadership it looks like Apple is coasting, allowing other companies in its category to catch up, in terms of products, features and build quality. Steve Jobs believed that Apple had to keep ahead of the pack or risk be overtaken by it. For whatever reason, Apple now risks being overtaken. Stanley Q.

By Teena Maddox | September 12, 2016, 11:17 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto Verizon announced Monday that it is purchasing Sensity Systems, a company that makes IoT products for smart cities—a move that signifies a strong push into the connected community market. Mike Lanman, senior vice president of enterprise products and IoT at Verizon, said in a press release: "Sensity is a leading provider of IoT solutions for smart communities with a strong ecosystem of partners, and this transaction will accelerate the deployment of large-scale implementations that will drive the digital transformation of cities, universities and venues." Sensity, which is based in Sunnyvale, CA, is a private company that has provided IoT solutions for a range of projects, including installing the sensors in Kansas City's LED smart streetlights, as previously reported in TechRepublic. Sensity has 42 smart city installations worldwide. "Sensity offers something that Verizon does not have, the ability to gather insights and data from different lighting infrastructure in all types of city environments, whether a street, building or public space," said Bettina Tratz-Ryan, vice president of research for smart ecosystems and cities for Gartner CIO Research Group. "In Gartner we predict that the street pole with lighting is the most valuable real estate on a street, given the fact that LED lighting can be mapped with other motion detectors, pollution monitors, vehicle trackers, parking systems and so on. Therefore, including intelligent lighting technology into an IoT platform that can harness and understand the lighting information in context with its environment and the data will become a very important game changer for creating the smart context in cities," she said.

Sensity installed 121 sensors in LED streetlights in a 2.2 mile smart district in Kansas City that opened in May this year. The city uses those sensors to track what is happening on the streets in that area, said Bob Bennett, Kansas City's chief innovation officer. Bennett said the city looks forward to continuing to work with Sensity on the project, despite the purchase agreement with Verizon, and he's meeting with them Tuesday to discuss where they are with the project. Sensity was a partner with Cisco on the Kansas City project. The partnership with Cisco is up in the air with the news of the acquisition. "The acquisition can create a competitive opportunity situation for Cisco to accelerate the rollout of smart city service environments, as Verizon as an infrastructure provider can deliver the right data from the interaction with the endpoints and sensors," Tratz-Ryan said. "On the other hand, projects done by Cisco around harnessing data and driving service value could also be competitively done by Verizon." As the smart city industry grows—projected to become a $400 billion market by 2020, with 600 cities around the globe expected to generate 60% of the world's GDP by 2025, according to McKinsey research—it's inevitable that more companies will look to acquire firms with IoT ties. Neil Strother, principal research analyst with Navigant Research, said he sees this as part of a long-term corporate strategy for Verizon. He said: "The fact that Verizon is buying a company with an IoT play behind it is not a surprise." "My view is that Verizon, like a lot of other companies such as SoftBank and Intel, and various hardware and software chip device manufacturers, are making investments in IoT companies or companies that enable end customers to do things with LED systems, or running smart buildings. There's a recognition that how these things connect, and the data they provide and the new applications and other services that you get out of a connected city, is valuable to customers and Verizon wants to be a part of that," Strother said. Sensity will give Verizon a way to strategically enter the smart city environment, Tratz-Ryan said. "The acquisition of Sensity will be supporting Verizon in finding the right point of entry into the development of smart city strategy, as cities are looking for the first steps to use digitalization to build smart services in the context of intelligent streets, and the ability to look at leveraging the data collected for multiple services." The market will continue to consolidate because of the lack of standardization that exists and the value that IoT can bring. "Creating those ecosystems through acquisitions enables a deeper and faster integration of those solutions and a faster rollout or proof of concept," Tratz-Ryan said. Terms of the transaction have not been disclosed, but a Verizon spokesperson confirmed that Sensity is being purchased in its entirety, including all employees. The acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016. Three takeaways for TechRepublic readers: Verizon is making a strong move into smart city technology with the acquisition of Sensity, an IoT services provider. Sensity is currently working with Kansas City on its connected city project, providing 121 sensors in LED smart streetlights. The smart city industry is predicted to be a $400 billion market by 2020.

Blog :  The Mistake of Investing in Technology Without First Investing in Values Article :  Gain More Control of BYOD Apps with an Enterprise App Store IBM and NVIDIA Move to Corner the Enterprise Market for AI Rob Enderle |   Unfiltered Opinion   |   Posted 12 Sep, 2016          |         |     Share A number of coming technologies will undoubtedly change the world as we know it. Two came to light last week while I was trying, and failing, to enjoy an infrequent vacation. One is a power storage technology that has high capacity and doesn’t catch fire or explode like lithium ion batteries. The other, and far more important, is artificial intelligence (AI), which has the potential to change our lives for the better or worse, but dramatically either way. An alliance between two of the most powerful companies in this race, IBM and NVIDIA, was announced last week around a small, intelligent, rack-mounted server called the Power System S822LC. This was part of a three-server launch last week and I think the implications are really interesting. NVIDIA is naturally very excited about this. Let’s explore why this partnership between two powerhouses could be really interesting. Think The word that IBM has connected with itself for much of my life is “Think,” and when it announced Watson, it put itself on a path to make that connection a reality. But Watson, as powerful as it is, is an intellectual baby when it comes to where the industry wants to go. Intelligent machines -- computers that can learn, adapt, and then make decisions based on data -- represent the future of computing and, some argue, the future of the human race. This makes for an impressive potential world impact and the firm, or firms, that get this right first will likely own the next age of computing. IBM, with Watson, got the initial lead, but Watson is expensive to buy and expensive to train. That’s why this isn’t a one-company effort. It can’t be; it will require a team. NVIDIA Now, while IBM was working on large-scale AI, NVIDIA has been working on packaged intelligence as a technology. Its Drive PX, CX, and DGX-1 platforms are designed to make cars intelligent. However, DGX-1 goes well beyond this in that it forms the basis for the learning that other platforms can use in production. In short, you train the DGX-1 and it trains, at scale, everything else it feeds. This is close, in concept, to being able to manufacture things (initially cars) that come off the line with all of the knowledge they need to operate. If we were talking people, this would be like having a kid that starts out at birth knowing everything you know. Now we just need to put the parts together. IBM + NVIDIA If we combine the two companies, we get the potential for not only a system that is far less expensive to buy but one that is far less expensive to train. The result may potentially be a system that is far smarter than Watson, far more capable than the DGX-1, and able to move both companies to the next tier. OpenPOWER The market is currently largely x86, and Intel dominates. Only one non-x86 platform has the potential to address this AI opportunity near term, and that is OpenPOWER, largely because it is backed by IBM and, unlike ARM, it is in production for servers of this class. It is also a technology shared by a variety of vendors, making it more attractive to customers like Google, which is aggressive with AI and particularly favors open systems. When you combine IBM, NVIDIA and OpenPOWER, you get something unique and potentially very powerful in this race to intelligent computing. Wrapping Up: Power of the Partnership In the end, the eventual success of this effort will likely be directly attributable to how well IBM and NVIDIA partner over time. A similar partnership between IBM, Intel and Microsoft created the PC market. If IBM and NVIDIA can do better (that earlier partnership fell apart), then the potential for both firms to own this next technology wave is unmatched. If not, then we’ll just have another story about big firms failing to meet their potential. For now, IBM and NVIDIA have the inside track, but it’s early in the race. While this new line of servers is a great start, as both companies know, it matters far less who leads a race at the beginning than who leads a race at the end.  Rob Enderle is President and Principal Analyst of the Enderle Group, a forward-looking emerging technology advisory firm.  With over 30 years’ experience in emerging technologies, he has provided regional and global companies with guidance in how to better target customer needs; create new business opportunities; anticipate technology changes; select vendors and products; and present their products in the best possible light.

The company has revealed the MSI VR One, the production version of the virtual reality backpack it teased earlier this year, a roughly eight pound chunk of overclocked computer intended to drive your HTC Vive. VR headsets like Vive – and others such as Oculus’ Rift – often deliver more immersive graphics and more potent games compared to all-in-one systems such as Samsung’s Gear VR, but they have a drawback too: they’re tethered to a PC. All that processing power requires a full gaming rig, which usually means a tower by which you’re attached with one or more cables. MSI’s solution is to put that gaming PC on your back and run it off batteries. Inside, there’s an Intel Core i7 processor and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070M graphics card, along with two hot-swappable batteries. The Vive – or your choice of VR headset – and any other peripherals plug in along the top edge, where there’s an HDMI output, Mini DisplayPort, and Thunderbolt 3 USB-C. Four USB 3.0 ports round things out. Cooling is courtesy of two 90mm fans and nine heat pipes, which MSI says will keep the VR One running at under 41 dBA – important, since the PC is right behind you. Of course, the big question is just how much runtime you get, and MSI is claiming 1.5 hours of play from both batteries. Since they can be swapped one at a time, you needn’t power down the PC in order to switch one out; if you need to exchange both, there’s an external power cord if you can stomach tethered play again. Putting a PC in a backpack is an intriguing idea, though for all MSI’s talk of its aggressive styling it’s not the most aesthetically appealing wearable out there. It’ll also face competition from companies pushing high-end VR performance that’s completely self-contained in a headset. Intel’s Project Alloy, for instance, aims to get much the same result as the VR One – grant full PC power without cables – but by integrating its latest-generation processors into a single unit. NOW READ: HTC Vive Review Project Alloy will be released as a reference design for Intel’s hardware partners, and the chipmaker expects to see production versions next year. MSI’s advantage will presumably be speed to market, with the VR One making its official debut at the Tokyo Gaming Show this week. Pricing is yet to be confirmed.

Cisco just bet on this one Like smartphones, IoT communications going long distance Video How the FCC fast-tracked its journey to the cloud The number of IoT connected “things” is expected to grow dramatically over the next few years, with estimates ranging as high as 50 billion connected devices by 2020. Indeed, this has caused somewhat of a stampede to try to offer broadband connectivity options to attach all of these devices to the cloud. Current networks supporting 4G/LTE offer connectivity but at a price that most IoT things can’t afford. Its not only a connection cost issue, but also one of power requirements (standard LTE modems are relatively power hungry), and size (many LTE modem chips are quite large given the size of many of the IoT devices). And most IoT devices need relatively low speed and low amounts of data transmission requirements, which are not the design center for modern LTE networks. So alternatives to standard wireless broadband networks are needed. Two players in this gold rush to connect all the devices coming on line are Sigfox and LoRa. Both are targeting the low power, low bandwidth requirements that most “things” need. And both are now deploying networks based on their own standards (Sigfox is a proprietary network owned by the company and LoRa is an alternative open network proposed by a consortium). But does either have a chance of success longer term? The answer, in my opinion, is no. This is WiMax all over again The standards body controlling the specs on broadband wireless connectivity (3GPP) was slow to react to the needs of low power and low bandwidth connections. This is not uncommon given the nature of various constituencies represented in the standards committee. Most standards bodies take time to do their work. But recently, 3GPP approved the Narrowband LTE spec (NB-LTE), also known as NB-IoT, technically designated as Cat M1 (1 mbps data rate) and Cat NB1 (40 kbps data rate) in Release 13 of the 3GPP LTE standard. The fundamental success factors of any network over the long term are investment to create scale, support by the major players, and supporting standards versus being proprietary. On all fronts, NB-LTE wins out. First, current LTE networks around the world can be upgraded with minimal investment to support NB-LTE. Indeed, many carriers have already announced their intention to do so (e.g., Verizon, AT&T). This will make it nearly ubiquitous within the next 1-2 years. Proprietary networks like Sigfox and LoRa need to be built out and therefore require major investments. LTE already has a huge footprint that can be leveraged, whereas the alternatives start from a green field deployment which can take years to fully deploy. Second, the largest vendors of modem chips (e.g., number 1 supplier Qualcomm, as well as major suppliers like Intel and others) have announced their endorsement of NB-LTE standards and have stated they will make system on a chip and standalone modem chips available to this standard within the next several months. And major carrier infrastructure vendors (e.g., Ericsson, Nokia, Huawei) have also announced support. The other networks can’t claim this level of support, and will have relatively few chip and infrastructure suppliers as they go where the standards (and volumes) lead them. Finally, NB-LTE is a worldwide standard and will therefore be implemented the same way current smartphone based networks are, allowing cross-carrier roaming and universal access. This scale is a major advantage to service providers, commercial users of Internet of Things/Enterprise of Things, and mobile “things.” Scale is important in any connectivity scenario as users will not deploy IoT with spotty or intermittent coverage. There is one other point that’s critical. NB-LTE has a direct pathway to the roll out of 5G networks. While 5G is still 3-4 years away, it will be critical to future uses. As a result it’s likely that NB-LTE will be around for a long time. Neither Sigfox or LoRa can claim such integration into the future networks. The bottom line is fairly simple: NB-LTE low power ultimately wins, as internationally deployed standards win out over proprietary green field networks. The chip companies and carrier infrastructure vendors ultimately will move to standards in supplying products. The major carriers will modify their existing LTE networks which will overwhelm the proprietary ones in sheer scope and capability. Current investments being made in Sigfox and LoRa (e.g., Vodafone) are only stop gaps to fill the void but it will be hard for them to grab enough scale to be successful longer term. Within 3-4 years, I expect all will be mothballed, or at least well on the way towards obsolescence. If there’s one thing we’ve learned from WiMax, it’s that is very hard to go against the grain when so many vested interests are at stake, even if you do have a potentially better, or at least more rapidly deployed solution.

Adam Markowitz University Ventures SJF Ventures Portfolium Portfolium raises $6.6 million to get college students into jobs where they’ll kick butt Posted Sep 12, 2016 by Lora Kolodny (@lorakolodny) 0 SHARES Next Story CollegeBacker publicly launches its college savings account advisory service A San Diego startup called Portfolium has raised $6.6 million to help college students get jobs where they are likely to succeed. Portfolium CEO Adam Markowitz said he was inspired to build what he calls the “largest student talent showcase,” after his own job-hunting success. A former rocket scientist, he was able to land a dream job working on NASA’s space shuttle program after coming to a job interview armed with a solid portfolio. “This is the most-educated but most under-employed generation in a long time. And that’s a problem,” Markowitz said. Unemployment and underemployment rates are hovering around 5.6% and 12.6% for the class of 2016, according to estimates reported by the Economic Policy Institute. And unemployment rates are substantially higher among young black and Hispanic graduates as compared to white non-Hispanic peers. Unlike LinkedIn, About.me or traditional resumes created for print formats, Portfolium asks students to upload samples of their work to prove they have the skills and experience they say they have. The work samples could range from a writing assignment, to a video, app, or 3-D model an engineer or industrial designer may have created. To guard against plagiarism, Portfolium parses work samples, and has integrated with university systems, allowing faculty to both assign and assess work samples through the site. Partner schools encompass huge state school systems, and small liberal arts colleges alike ranging from California’s UC and Cal State systems to Williams College. Founded in 2014, Markowitz said Portfolium has partnered with about 200 universities and colleges to-date, and has 3.75 million students under contract.   Portfolium CEO Adam Markowitz.   Perhaps more importantly for job-seeking students, Portfolium has also partnered with 60,000 employers among them: Oracle, ViaSat, Nike, Intel, Hulu, SpaceX, Northrop Grumman, Boeing, Disney, and Cisco. “Work samples are the number one indicator of future job performance,” Markowitz said, “And they don’t look uniform and dull like a pile of resumes can to a recruiter.” SJF Ventures led the investment in Portfolium joined by University Ventures, and USA Funds, a large guarantor of student loans. University Ventures’ Managing Director Ryan Craig said his firm backed Portfolium, in part, because of its rapid uptake within the university market. “Universities increasingly understand that employability is the primary motivation and concern for new and current students. Higher education can no longer be simply about preparing students for their fifth job; since the recession, we know that if students don’t get a great first job, they’re unlikely to get a great fifth job,” he said. The investor wants to see Portfolium use the funding for hiring and to develop some new features and services. One he expects to see within a couple of years from Portfolium is a service that allows employers to connect with students in their early college years to suggest coursework or to offer virtual internships to those who have key competencies the company seeks in an employee.

(AMD), General Mills, Inc. (GIS) and Kroger Co (KR) Are 3 of Today’s Worst Stocks AMD, GIS and KR stock couldn't win for losing on Wednesday By James Brumley, InvestorPlace Feature Writer  |  Sep 7, 2016, 4:37 pm EST     Popular Posts: 10 Small-Cap Stocks That Could Double in 2017 The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2016 Intel Corporation (INTC) Stock is Working Its Way Back to Relevancy Recent Posts: Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (ANF) Stock Is Beyond All Hope It’s Time to Rethink How We Value Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Stock This Is the Best Thing to Happen to Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) In a While View All Posts Once again, a lack of decisive news and a clear future left traders on the fence. Already backing away from yesterday’s buying effort, the S&P 500 ended the day at 2186.15, down a mere 0.02%. Leading the tepid bearish charge were General Mills, Inc. (NYSE:GIS), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and Kroger Co (NYSE:KR). Here’s a closer look at why each was up-ended. Kroger Co (KR) If you’re looking for the reason Kroger shares were down nearly 4% on Wednesday, blame rival grocer Sprouts Farmers Market Inc (NASDAQ:SFM), and Jim Cramer. Sprouts Farmers Market issued lackluster full-year guidance on Wednesday, and Cramer extrapolated its view to apply it to all grocery chains, including Kroger. The specifics: Sprouts Farmers Market now anticipates earning between 83 and 86 cents per share of SFM for 2016, versus previous guidance of between 92 and 94 cents per share. A lowered price target for SFM, from $25 to $20, prompted a 13.7% setback for that stock. 5 Stocks to Sell for September Commentator Jim Cramer warned investors that the trouble brewing for Sprouts meant investors would be best served by also steering clear of KR shares. However, Kroger may be a worthy exception to his broad assessment. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Were it not for one nagging detail, Advanced Micro Devices shares would have likely made solid progress today. Not only did the company win an award for its 25×20 energy efficiency initiative, its new Zen server chips are highly competitive with those made by rival Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). The nagging detail that sent AMD shares 6.8% lower on Wednesday? It’s going to be issuing $600 million worth of AMD shares, and selling another $450 million worth of convertible debt. That’s a big chunk of change for the $5.5 billion organization, but the setback could have been worse in light of the offering’s size. MKM Partners may have muted much of the selling effort, commenting that “While existing investors won’t like the share dilution, the reduction in interest expense offsets. We expect AMD shares to recover following an offerings-related pullback,” and maintaining its price target of $8.00 for AMD. General Mills, Inc. (GIS) Last but not least, General Mills may be just as optimistic about the current fiscal years as it ever was. But, it didn’t get off to a great start. The food company served up fiscal Q1 guidance that gave GIS shareholders indigestion. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Is a Buy on This Dip (AMD) All told, General Mills cautioned today that for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 — which ended in August — it would report earnings below the year-ago bottom line of 69 cents per share. Analysts were expecting a profit of 77 cents per share of GIS. Nevertheless, General Mills expects all of 2017 to be a solid year. Earnings per share of GIS are projected to grow between 6% and 8%, despite slight weakness in sales of organic food. GIS ended the day down 4.3%. As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Photo of Dublin’s Ha’penny Bridge by Leonid Andronov via Shutterstock Not only Ireland’s capital, Dublin is Ireland’s ‘venture capital’, attracting the lion’s share of investment in the country. It’s time to ensure a more level playing field for the nation’s start-ups, says John Kennedy. Ireland has a venture funding problem. No, not a problem with getting venture capital because funding levels and investments are actually on the rise if various reports are anything to go by. The problem is that the funding appears to be mostly going to one place: Dublin. There are lots reports that attempt to quantify the amount of funding raised by companies in Europe, all with varying degrees of accuracy. ‘Instead of Silicon Docks or Rebel Valley, we need to cop on to the fact that we are a small country and we need to work together. Creating little fiefdoms will achieve nothing’ – DAVID COALLIER, BARRICADE In May, the Irish Venture Capital Association (IVCA) reported that Dublin firms attracted more than 80pc of all disclosed funding in the first three months of 2016, followed by Galway (which, thanks to its large life sciences cohort, attracted around 11pc of funding). On Friday, the IVCA reported the latest figures for the second quarter of the year showing a new record high of €486m for the first half of 2016. The bulk of this investment – some €196m – went into life sciences companies, followed by software (€97m), fintech (€91m) and telecoms (€49m). Outstanding investments included Mainstay Medical, which raised €30m; Intercom, which raised €44m (but one could argue why it is on the list at all since it is not an Irish SME but was founded in San Francisco); and fintech player Circle, which raised €53m. All of these companies have Dublin operations. Another report this week, based on  figures derived from EY’s Start-up Barometer Germany report, listed Dublin in sixth place among Europe’s top seven start-up cities in terms of funding levels in the first half of 2016. By this chart’s reckoning, Ireland amassed €238m in venture capital – quite a remove from the IVCA report’s figure – up from €69m the previous year. And, according to this particular report, €229m of that money went into start-ups in Dublin. Readers on Twitter over the weekend were quick to point out that this equated to 97pc of funding raised in Ireland going to Dublin start-ups. While we can’t vouch for the accuracy of either report over the other, they both signal one thing. If 80pc to 97pc of venture capital funding in Ireland is going to Dublin, that is a serious problem for start-ups in Cork, Limerick, Galway and elsewhere. But let’s be pragmatic and fair rather than territorial. A river of money runs through it There are lots of logical reasons for Dublin to amass the lion’s share of funding. Firstly, it’s the biggest city on the island by population and start-ups coalesce around cities and communities. It’s part of the chemistry. It’s how ideas are formed and people are hired. One of the reasons Dublin is warmly regarded as a global high-tech hub – aside from the presence of players like Google and Facebook – is because there is a certain intimacy to the city. Everyone knows each other. Secondly, Dublin has the highest concentration of universities and colleges, which are in truth the engine rooms for most of the world’s start-up ventures. Thanks to the efforts of the likes of NDRC, academic research is being right-purposed and spun out to create credible, compelling start-ups as academics and students are transformed into entrepreneurs. All of the other cities in Ireland have their universities and colleges with their own entrepreneurial programmes, incubators and accelerators, but Dublin just happens to have the highest concentration of these resources. Thirdly, Dublin is on the map in terms of international transport. And, let’s be fair, the Web Summit in its five-year sojourn in the city helped to raise this profile enormously. Even though the event has departed for sunny Lisbon, its administrative nerve centre is still in Dublin. So, if the logic is that Dublin’s scale, profile and population dictate where funding investment goes, what are we to do about other cities that have abundant entrepreneurial talent? Cork, for example, has spawned international companies such as Trustev and Teamwork. Last year, Limerick-based AMCS raised €45m in a funding round. In recent weeks, Galway firm Bluedrop Medical bagged €600,000 in funding while another member of the Galway start-up tribe – Vivasure Medical – raised a whopping €16m. One island, one people, one community Lots of companies outside of Dublin are raising investment and doing their own thing. Look at Waterford software start-up NearForm, which last year announced 100 new jobs. Or another Waterford tech firm, FeedHenry, which was acquired by software giant Red Hat for €63.5m. Things are happening outside of Dublin – incredible things. While we have to conclude that, due to size and scale, Dublin is producing monsters (look at Movidius, which was acquired by Intel for an estimated €300m), is it good enough to accept the funding imbalance as the natural order of things? Actually, I would argue that some tech firms are gaining by not being in Dublin. In fact, AMCS’s Austin Ryan argues, not being in Dublin has been critical to the company’s ability to secure funding and retain employees. “In Dublin, companies have huge staff churn and start-ups lose people to multinationals. A lot of indigenous companies wake up and hear the news that Google or Facebook are creating 200 new jobs and they just sigh,” Ryan said in a recent interview. This view was backed up by David Coallier of security software start-up Barricade, who also pointed out that being in Cork rather than Dublin has been key to the company attracting talent. “Instead of Silicon Docks or Rebel Valley, we need to cop on to the fact that we are a small country and we need to work together. Creating little fiefdoms will achieve nothing,” he said. Ultimately, I would take stock in Coallier’s assertion. We need to think of Ireland less as a collection of cities with distinct start-up tribes and more as one location where everyone is within driving distance of an international airport and, thus, within hours or a day’s reach of Europe or San Francisco. Funding imbalances will occur due to the logic of scale. But it should not be that genuine entrepreneurs and job creation opportunities in regional locations are being overlooked by a Dublin-centric funding community that rarely ventures outside the city walls. The regions themselves aren’t being slouches. The city of Cork, for example, will be the first location in Europe to host the international Startup Nations Summit, which will take place during the 2016 Global Start-up Gathering (GSG2016) from 18 to 20 November. This is a fundamental opportunity to showcase not only the city and county of Cork’s start-up community and expertise, but the entire country’s potential. If a funding imbalance exists on paper, that’s fine. But let’s not let it become a mental block that will prevent all the nation’s start-ups and entrepreneurs from standing up and being counted.

Teaching methods used in the classroom are undergoing major improvements over the years. Schools and universities are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated by harnessing advanced technologies. The introduction of learning management systems (LMSs) and learning content management systems (LCMSs) in the market has made the development of content faster for academicians and education experts. Complete report on stick PC market spread across 61 pages, analyzing 12 major companies and providing 36 data exhibits now available at http://www.sandlerresearch.org/global-stick-pc-market-2016-2020.html. The analysts forecast global stick PC market to grow at a CAGR of 6.87% during the period 2016-2020. According to the stick PC market report, one of the key drivers for market growth will be low cost advantage of stick PCs. The market expectations are that the lower pricing of stick PCs will drive the volumes, which in turn, will help the manufacturers scale the production and reduce the cost in order to increase their profit margin. As the stick PC market is still in its initial stages of industry life cycle, the competition is low and price wars are negligible. This also means that the reducing ASPs will not have any influence on driving the volumes. In terms of geography, APAC will dominate the stick PC market throughout the forecast period, and this market study estimates that this region will account for more than 37% of the total share of the market by 2020. The developing countries in the region such as India and China will be the major contributors of the market revenue from this region. The K-12 segment in these countries is in the initial stages of adopting the digital infrastructure, and this will drive the demand to provide students and instructors with the necessary devices to facilitate digital learning. Additionally, governments in the region are also implementing large-scale technology initiatives to boost the education sector towards technology-based learning, which will also aid in the rise in growth of the stick PC market in this region. Stick PCs are integrated with processors and memory chips that have been scaled down for optimum performance and embedded multimedia card. The reducing node size of memory ICs from the semiconductor manufacturers will lead to an increased internal memory storage capacity of stick PCs. Further technological advancements in the semiconductor industry will fuel the miniaturization of semiconductor components, which will enable stick PC manufacturers to save space on the printed circuit boards and integrated components, which will facilitate them to add more features to the stick PCs.

Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) Sep 11, 2016 at 1:41PM Image source: Getty Images. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is certainly an alluring company right now. Its shares have gained more than 100% year-to-date, with much of the bullish sentiment riding on the growing popularity and opportunity behind virtual reality. To help put the recent stock run in perspective -- and to point out some potential pitfalls at the company -- let's take a look at three charts that paint a fuller picture of AMD and the state of its business. Revenue has fallen fast, but it's improving Longtime AMD shareholders will know that the company's revenue has been anything but encouraging over the past few years. Since 2014, the top line has declined by about 39% from its high. Data by YCharts. The main reason for the decline came from slowing sales of AMD's PC processors, particularly in notebooks. PC chips are among the company's biggest revenue drivers, and a slowdown in the PC market over the past few years has hurt AMD tremendously. Despite the bad times, the company is starting to see revenue growth return, thanks to increased demand for chips and a new licensing deal with Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology. The latter adds about $52 million to AMD's revenue this year, while the former should help the company's long-term prospects. AMD certainly isn't out of the woods yet, and investors will need to see the company deliver on promising new chips (like its upcoming Zen processor for servers) and new GPUs to see if the recent rebound is sustainable.  This is changing AMD's focus  A couple of years ago, the company highlighted a few key areas that it would pursue in order to turn around its business. One of those areas of focus is what the company calls immersive platforms, which include PC components and the growing augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) markets.  The total addressable market for immersive platforms is $20 billion, according to the company, and much of that will come from the AR and VR segments.  AMD CTO Mark Papermaster highlighted the company's focus on boosting VR adoption rates in a recent interview with TechRadar, saying: At AMD, we frankly aim to directly impact that adoption rate. That's why, for instance, we brought that $200 price point for the RX 480. That broke the paradigm -- that is a VR-ready graphics card. You can have a wonderful VR experience, 90 frames per second, very low latency with that graphics card. The graph below shows exactly why AMD is pinning some of its future revenue prospects on the AR and VR markets -- because they'll be worth potentially $150 billion by 2020. Image source: Digi-Capital. AR and VR certainly aren't the only markets that AMD is focusing on, of course, but with immersive platforms marked as one of the top three focuses for the company over the next few years, it's clear the company is expecting its GPUs to be a major part of its growth story. This stock is on the move  It's hard to write an article showing some of the most important AMD charts without including the company's massive bull run this year. The stock has already more than doubled in 2016, with a nearly 220% gain over the past 12 months.   Data by YCharts. Management and shareholders hope that the upcoming Zen release could steal some of the $18 billion server market away from rival Intel. The company says it has already secured several design wins with original equipment manufacturers and that it will officially launch the chip in the first half of 2017. The bottom line AMD certainly has a lot going for it in the GPU, VR, and PC markets -- management is wisely pursuing new areas of growth and re-entering markets where they believe the company can succeed (like server processors). But without stable revenue, the incredible share price gains would make me hesitant to invest in the company right now. It definitely appears that there are brighter days ahead for the company, but investors should be careful not to overestimate the success AMD will enjoy based on such early efforts with little to show for them.  Chris Neiger has no position in any stocks mentioned.

While some Linux distributions are suitable for older or slower hardware, others are famous for being heavily customizable. If we discuss the ones that are most elegant, elementary OS proves to be the best option. Often called ‘poor man’s Apple’, elementary OS looks and feels like OS X. After spending more than a year in development, the elementary OS team has released elementary OS 0.4 Loki. This release follows Freya, which was released in April of 2015. For this release, Loki development team closed about 1,000 issue reports and acted on more than 20 blueprints. Overall, these changes bring stability and security improvements to the operating system. This Ubuntu-based distribution is based on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Linux kernel 4.4. It brings improved hardware support, including 6th-gen Intel Skylake CPUs and graphics. More changes come in the form of support for ambient light sensors.

bit-tech.net Home News Reviews Hardware Modding Gaming Blog Forums Search All Hardware Gaming Industry Other Be Quiet! announces Pure Rock Slim cooler Published on 7th September 2016 by Gareth Halfacree 0 Comments News Be Quiet!'s new Pure Rock Slim boasts an asymmetric layout to its fin stack to aid clearance on cramped mini-ITX motherboards. Be Quiet! has announced a new tower cooler, the Pure Rock Slim, with an asymmetric design it claims will help it squeeze onto cramped mini-ITX motherboards. The Be Quiet! Pure Rock Slim, the company claims, has been designed for smaller builds which nevertheless boast enough clearance for its upright 92mm seven-blade 'SilentWings' fan and 124.8mm height. Where such tower-style coolers are compatible, the company says that the asymmetric layout of the fin stacks - which sees the rear stack being significantly higher than the front stack - will aid with clearance of RAM modules and other components that can otherwise foul larger heatsinks. Featuring three 6mm outside-diameter heat pipes running through a copper base to the twin aluminium fin stacks, Be Quiet! claims the Pure Rock Slim is capable of cooling any current Intel or AMD processor with up to a 120W thermal design profile (TDP). The overall size of the cooler comes in at 81.8mm by 97mm, plus the aforementioned 128.8mm height, including the bundled fan but excluding the size of the mounting brackets used. More information about the Pure Rock Slim can be found on Be Quiet!'s official product page. UK availability and pricing have yet to be confirmed.

Well, you know how that turned out. And I get it. There are plenty of reasons why Apple is sticking with its proprietary connector. It allows the company to have more control over its devices and make more money via licensing. (Apple makes money for each third-party MFi-certified -- "made for iDevice" -- cable and accessory is sold.) USB-C compatibility issues also have been plaguing the mobile industry for the past many months. And Apple already caused a wave of outrage as it transitioned from the old iPod-era 30-pin connector to the Lightning standard when the iPhone 5 debuted back in 2012. So, OK, a USB-C iPhone will probably never happen. But here's why I think Apple should move to USB-C, anyway. 38 Best iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus cases USB-C is a big step forward from Micro-USB. When Apple first debuted the Lightning connector 4 years ago I didn't mind it much, though I wished Apple had opted for the then popular Micro-USB instead. After all, Lightning then used the same USB 2.0 standard and shared the same speed. But at least the Lightning connector was much easier to use. Compared to that now ancient-looking 30-pin connector, Lightning was far smaller. And the unlike Micro-USB, it was reversible -- you could plug it into the phone upside down. Later on, when USB 3.0 became more popular, the Micro-USB 3.0 connector was introduced. While it was backwards compatible with narrower Micro-USB connectors, the 3.0 version was just way so big, ugly and inconvenient to plug in that very few smartphones adopted it. (By the way, you can read more about USB connectors here.) The Galaxy Note 3 was about the only known handset that did. And so, I was fine with Lightning all the way to the iPhone 6S. But now, we have USB-C, an unified connector type that has the same physical size as Lighting, its cable can be plugged in however way you want, can do everything a Lightning connector does and more, and has been adopted by most, if not all, other vendors. It only makes sense that Apple should use it for its latest phones. Apple already uses USB-C on its MacBook. Enlarge Image This Apple Macbook has a USB-C port, so why not the iPhone?Photo by Sarah Tew/CNET That's right, Apple is the one of the first companies that brought USB-C to laptops and it did so in an extreme manner: the 12-inch Macbook which first debuted in 2015 has no other connector than that single USB-C port used for both charging as well as connecting devices to the computer. (OK, not totally true: the other port on that MacBook is, ironically, a 3.5mm headphone jack -- now gone from the new iPhones.) While some grumbled about the single port (a breakout dongle adds other legacy jacks and the ability to charge while using other peripherals), the MacBook's USB-C port was a forward-looking feature that even allows for bidirectional power. That means you can also charge the Macbook from a connected USB-C device (in addition to, say, providing power to a phone or other peripheral). It's also rumored that new Mac models expected later this year will be getting USB-C. And that means for now, and near future, you will need an adapter to connect your new iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus to some of the Macs. Isn't that ironic? Better for users Whenever I pack for a trip, I need to carry at least three type of cables. Lightning cables to charge my iPhone and my iPad, USB-C cables to use with my external hard drive, and Thunderbolt cables so that I can connect a display to my Macbook Pro. Yet more often than not, I still find myself short on cables. I was ecstatic to learn that starting with Thunderbolt 3, Intel has opted for USB-C connector, allowing all Thunderbolt 3 port to work as a USB-C port and all USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 cables to work interchangeably. Now if the new iPhones also used USB-C connector, I'd just need to carry a few USB-C cables and I'm game. Most importantly, ain't you tired of adapters, already! Those extra little easy-to-lose, always-misplaced things that you need to carry along or clutter your desk with. Going USB-C is the only way to get rid of them once and for all. The idea of one port to rule them all is also great in case of emergency. You won't need to fumble with the cables before you can charge your device. You may not even need to bum a cable from a friend and when you do, they'd definitely have the one you need, because they'd all be the same.. So if the new iPhones had USB-C, cable anxiety would soon be no more. Photo by Josh Miller/CNET Better for environment Let's face it. The new iPhones will almost certainly sell in the tens of millions, headphone jack blowback or not. And that means millions and millions of Lightning cables, Lightning-to-audio adapters, Lightning headphones and third-party accessories. Eventually, all of them will become e-waste, filling up our landfills. You can argue that if the new phones supported USB-C, we'd still need the cables and adapters (USB-C-to-audio) anyway. That's true. But in this case, the cables and adapters can be used interchangeably with other USB-C devices. You wouldn't need two sets of cables and accessories, one for Apple devices and another for non-Apple devices. And you can keep the cables (and accessories) longer because you can always make use of them with future USB-C devices, which are only going to multiply in 2017 and beyond. Apple has been big on claiming itself an environmentally conscientious company. Then why doesn't it use the universal connector standard that helps cut down waste and the use of natural recourses? The USB-C dream When announcing the iPhone 7, Apple's Phil Schiller said that it takes "courage" to remove the headphone jack. Don't fool yourself! Removing the jack, but keeping the Lightning connection, revealed Apple's intention to go completely proprietary, to have more control, and ultimately to make more money. Remember that MFi certification mentioned earlier? Apple gets a cut of literally anything you plug into the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus (so long as it's a legit accessory). Sounds less like courage to me, and more like greed. But going proprietary can also lead to the downfall of a company. This is partly why Sony -- once the biggest name in electronics -- is much less relevant than it was a decade or two ago. You remember: when it would keep trying to convince you that you needed to re-buy that same movie or song on a MiniDisc and a UMD (and maybe a memory stick), after you already had it on a CD or DVD. I could be wrong, though. Maybe Tim Cook has decided to save USB-C for the 2017 iPhone. But next time, I won't bet on it.

(Far r.): Hackathons have become popular events at California’s Santa Clara County Library District in Silicon Valley Last summer, Bloomberg BusinessWeek devoted an entire issue to “What Is Code?” a single article by Brooklyn-based writer and programmer Paul Ford. It quickly generated more traffic on the business magazine’s website than any other article since the site’s launch in 2010, editors told the Huffington Post a few weeks after the story’s publication. The detailed-but-­accessible essay discusses key concepts in computer programming, programming languages, and the software development process at businesses. Yet perhaps one theme that grabbed readers from the business community and kept them engaged throughout the 38,000-word piece was the idea that “you,” a successful VP at a large company, are working with “The Man in the Taupe Blazer,” a project leader who has been hired for a major overhaul of your company’s website. And during your initial meeting, “you” can barely understand what he’s talking about. “For your entire working memory, some Internet thing has come along every two years and suddenly hundreds of thousands of dollars (inevitably millions) must be poured into amorphous projects with variable deadlines,” Ford writes in the intro. “Content management projects, customer relationship management integration projects, mobile apps, paperless office things, global enterprise resource planning initiatives—no matter how tightly you clutch the purse strings, software finds a way to pry open your fingers.” The article doesn’t argue that business executives could solve this problem by dropping everything and learning C. There is a reason that they hire experts for their multimillion-dollar projects. Instead, Ford’s breakdown of key concepts pulls back the curtain on the fundamentals of computer programming and makes a compelling argument that any smart person can learn the basics—and that the basics are worth learning even for those who aren’t planning to become professional coders. It is, in part, a case for coding as a new frontier in digital literacy. As technology becomes an ever more ubiquitous facet of modern work and entertainment, speaking a bit of the language is one of the best ways to facilitate communication with those experts. “Once you understand the basics of coding—or anything, really—as you get older, you can see where it goes,” says Alex Giannini, manager of digital experience for the Westport Public Library, CT. “Kids today are growing up with an iPad in their hands. They don’t have to learn the digital language; they’re born with it. The more that we can integrate even basic coding younger and younger, it just makes it easier to grasp the true concepts as they get older.” There’s a growing interest in this type of education among kids, teens, businesspeople, career changers, and the generally curious. And a growing number of public libraries are already responding to this need within their communities. Here’s a look at ways in which a few libraries have made their programs a success. (For more on the library’s role in teaching coding for kids both in a school and public library setting, see Coding Skills Empower Us All, and look for more in SLJ 4/16.) Constant communication Florida’s Orange County Library System (OCLS), Orlando, offers an example of how a technology curriculum can grow when a library system responds to local demand and seeks regular feedback regarding its community’s needs. Fourteen years ago, like most libraries, OCLS offered classes on computer basics. Patrons began requesting computer classes taught in Spanish and Haitian Creole, so the library set up high-demand classes in those languages. Multipart courses on software such as Excel and Photoshop were added owing to demand. Surveys revealed that there were many patrons who were interested in the classes but couldn’t fit travel to the library into their schedule, so a series of live, online web courses was launched eight years ago, notes ­Ormilla Vengersammy, Melrose Center manager and Technology and Education Department head for OCLS. Due in part to the growth of Orlando’s technology sector, demand has been increasing for courses in topics from HTML 5 and mobile app development to networking concepts and electronics prototyping. With its current slate of about 250 in-person and online tech courses, OCLS has one of the most comprehensive computer course selections in the library field. “We do a lot of analysis prior to developing a course,” explains Vanya Walker, instructional technology specialist for OCLS. “We look at trends to determine the needs of our audience. We also ask our patrons, in regular surveys, ‘What do you need?’ ” Once demand is determined, Walker says that OCLS then examines the topic to decide whether that need should be addressed with an individual class or a multipart course. “We look at the scope of the class, and what we want to cover, and then we find natural breaks,” she says. For example, with the library’s HTML 5 class, which consists of four 90-minute sessions, “we know we want to cover the basics of HTML and the basics of web design. We know that [we must] cover CSS or Cascading Style Sheets, because that’s an integral part of HTML 5. And we’re also going to include JavaScript…. It takes you through the complete, basic process of designing a website from scratch.” The library also supplements its classes with an institutional subscription to Lynda.com, but Vengersammy notes that OCLS still considers in-person instruction to be a priority, enabling attendees to ask a teacher questions in real time and work with other patrons. Learn as you go The Denver Public Library (DPL) has followed a similar trajectory at its Community Technology Center, which began as a traditional computer lab offering one-on-one assistance and classes in computer basics and has expanded in recent years as patrons began requesting more advanced instruction. Program coordinator Nate Stone organized staff-taught classes on the open source content management system WordPress and subsequently four-part courses on HTML and CSS. Later, a separate four-part course on JavaScript provided patrons with a comprehensive web development track. Then, people started asking about the programming language Python. “None of us on the staff here felt like we had the skills set to teach that as a structured class,” says Cody Yantis, librarian at DPL’s Community Technology Center and ideaLAB. So, Yantis simply dove into the programming language alongside interested students. “We ended up doing an eight-week [course in which] we met once a week and worked through an online resource together. So I learned as well. I would just work ahead and come up with some exercises, but then we would also just tackle stuff together. And it worked out really well.” DPL is planning to offer a similar Python course this spring. It’s a great example of how a library might use online resources such as Codecademy, Code.org, Lynda.com, Treehouse, or a curated selection of free web resources to develop courses on advanced topics in-house even without a preexisting expert on staff. Denver’s tech sector is on the rise, and locals have the option of enrolling in for-profit coding “boot camps” for advanced instruction and job training. But as Yantis notes, those types of courses are generally an expensive investment, often costing individuals $10,000 or more. “For the Community Technology Center, we see our place as kind of a bridge,” he says. “We’re never going to offer a high enough level of [instruction] to get someone a professional programmer job as soon as they finish. But it may get them into a program that will lead to that…. This allows people to try it out, see if it speaks to them, without any kind of financial obligation.” Make friends As programs grow, however, opportunities to provide more advanced instruction can grow as well. DPL’s Community Technology Center and ideaLAB Maker space has begun attracting attention from local tech companies, some of which have expressed interest in teaching classes or offering mentorship. The Melrose Center at OCLS has become a regular meet-up spot for IndieNomicon, a local group of game developers and entrepreneurs. Last summer, Intel hosted a six-week “Innovator Lab” to help programmers work with the company’s RealSense 3-D camera and gesture-based human-computer interaction technology. Afterward, it donated equipment to OCLS. A proactive search for instructors can also produce help from quarters that many libraries might not expect. At California’s Santa Clara County Library District (SCCL), in the heart of Silicon Valley, teen services librarian Matt Lorenzo developed coding courses with help from members of academic clubs at local high schools. Advanced teens now teach coding courses for middle school students at the library. “I wasn’t really sure how much attendance we would have, but, right off the bat, a class filled up,” Lorenzo says. Whether it’s a teen instructor or a guest speaker from a local tech company, Lorenzo says that part of the challenge is helping these instructors explain complex concepts in ways that their audience can easily grasp. “They have to have sound knowledge, and they have to be able to express that to other learners in a way that can be retained by students,” he says. “I spend a good amount of time working with presenters to make sure that everything is lined up in an easily understandable, flowing manner…. With the older kids able to help the younger ones…it takes that classroom feel where ‘you need to know this or you’re going to get a bad grade’ off the table. It relieves a lot of pressure for younger learners when they’re being taught by their peers.” With young people accustomed to teaching one another and working with mentors from the local tech industry, the library’s Cupertino branch has become a great spot for hackathon events. Last summer, more than 100 local teens participated in a 12-hour, all-night event where they worked in groups to create apps and games, then presented their creations to a panel of judges. Get them hooked Thanks to a generous private donation, Westport PL was able to take its coding curriculum to the next level in 2014, acquiring two small humanoid NAO Evolution robots by Paris-based Aldebaran Robotics. At about $8,000 each, these walking, talking, dancing robots are currently priced out of reach for many library systems, but the program engagement that Westport managed to generate during the past two years could indicate that inexpensive programmable robots, such as Sphero or Ollie, could be a good way to capture attention, introduce basic concepts, and then take a deeper dive for patrons who become interested in more advanced coding. The robots, named Vincent and Nancy, instantly captured the community’s imagination. Giannini says that shortly after acquiring the robots, Westport announced a series of classes on its website, six days per week with a demonstration on Sundays, with the classes capped at ten attendees each. “It was a Friday afternoon,” he says. “By Sunday morning, two months’ worth of classes were full.” The robots can be programmed by novices using proprietary software called Choreograph, which Giannini describes as similar to Scratch, a visual programming language for kids developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Offering introductory classes in which everyone could use ­Choreograph and see instant results from their work kept ­attendees engrossed, while identifying patrons who might be curious to learn more. “You can take a class with us, and by the end of the class you can have the robot wave and say something, and there’s instant gratification,” Giannini says. “Once you go deeper into that software, Python is underneath. By the end of the year, we trained over 2,000 patrons on [Choreograph]. I’d say 90 percent were happy taking the [basic] courses we provided, creating a 30- to 60-second program on the robot, using existing movements…. But there was that ten percent who wanted to go deeper. And for them, we did an Hour of Code [course], and we taught Python.” Want to learn more?

Registration is $250; SIGN UP NOW Progress report Vengersammy and Walker agree that breaking a course down into manageable segments and demonstrating visible results help to keep learners involved. “One key to capturing an audience’s attention is to show them the end product first,” Vengersammy says. “This is what you’re going to create.” In the OCLS two-part Arduino course, one of the very first things attendees do is set up the device and issue a command to make an LED light blink. “You have to tell it where the power is coming from, what ports you are using, how fast the light should blink. And people see it right away, and they’re so excited,” Walker says. “Then you can challenge them—make it blink faster, make it blink slower…. People think ‘code’ and ‘programming’ and ‘microcontrollers’ and they think ‘that’s going to be too much for me.’ When you pre­sent it the way that we do, which is fun and easy and exciting, people build their skills without even realizing it.” Once the library helps patrons get past any initial trepidation and instills the confidence that they, too, can learn to code, it may just be the spark they need to seek out more knowledge or start their own projects. At Westport, Giannini says that he has reached a bit of a saturation point with large public demos of the robots, but that’s not a bad thing. Going forward, Vincent and Nancy will continue to be in demand for advanced students, including a programming group from a local community college that recently booked a weekly ­session. “It’s one thing to give people the tool and show them the tool, but once they see the tool and understand [it], they want to take it and use it for their own purposes,” Giannini explains. “That’s the goal of any of the stuff that we teach. Actually, that’s why we teach.” This article was published in Library Journal. Subscribe today and save up to 35% off the regular subscription rate.

The event took place for the first time this Sunday at Impact Hub Bamako, which is the local ambassador for Seedstars World and co-organized the event. The 8 selected startups were invited to present their ideas in front of the local jury panel. “It was an amazing experience to have Seedstars World organize the event in Bamako. I saw a group of amazingly enthusiastic entrepreneurs who will show the world that we have amazing talent in the country.” says Mohamed Keita, CEO and Founder of Impact Hub Bamako. The local winner, Aikio Corp, a platform for medical laboratories to transmit medical test results to patients safely and confidentially online and by sms, was selected the best startup in Mali. “I’m on a mission to improve healthcare in Africa and I believe that my solution is one that is relevant for many and can literally save lives.” explains Boubacar Keita, founder and CEO of Aikio Corp. As a part of the prize, Aikio Corp will be participating at Seedstars Summit, taking place in Switzerland in April 2017, a weeklong training program with the opportunity to meet the other 60 winners, as well as investors and mentors from around the world. Traditionally, the final day of the Summit will be dedicated to pitching in front of audience of 1000 attendees, with the possibility of winning up to the USD 1 million equity investment. 1st runner up is Transup, a technology that allows anyone to transfer phone credit between different operators. Feuze, an electronic device that allows for registration, insurance and geolocation of motorbikes, grabbed the last spot in the top 3. The other startups invited to pitch were Pharmoso, E-Keneya, AllianceJ, Orientkey, HVM.

Mali is yet again an example that proves that it is not about where you are from, but what you do. We are very excited to bring Aikio Corp to our global summit and hope that this event will inspire young talented people in the country to start their own businesses.” says Claudia Makadristo, Associate for Seedstars World Africa. Seedstars Bamako also featured speaker mr. Bally, CEO and President of Azalaï Hotels, who spoke about his experience of an entrepreneurs and how important it is to stay humble, modest and focused. “great entrepreneurs have humility, resilience, and good debt to equity ratio”. The event was carried out with the support of Orange, Total, Azalaï Hotels and Binthily Communication. All participating startups will also qualify for two major prizes that Seedstars World is running this year: Together with TRECC Startups in Education qualify for the global “Transforming Education Prize” which will award the best startup in the education space from around the world with a prize of over USD 50,000. In addition, Seedstars World and Intel are collaborating on the “Intel Solutions Challenge” to find the best startups in Hardware, IoT, Cloud and Analytics with the goal of inviting them to a prestigious Demo Day with internal and external partners who will give access to market and funding for the best startups. Continuing on its world tour of startup scenes in emerging markets and fast-growing startup scenes, Seedstars World’s next stop is Ethiopia at Addis Abbaba’s Ice Addis, to select the best startup in the country.

Gameranx NEWS FEATURES PLATFORMS PC PlayStation 4 Xbox One VIDEOS UPCOMING GAMES GUIDES September 9, 2016 BioShock: The Collection PC Requirements Revealed The Steam version of the collection will go live on September 15th. Kris Kittie / Updates / 2K Games, Bioshock The Collection, PC, Steam / 2k has revealed the PC system requirements for Bioshock: The Collection on Steam today. They will be listed in full at the bottom of the article. In addition, the publisher has detailed upgrade instructions for players who have purchased the Games for Windows Live versions of the first two games. If you own Bioshock and/or Bioshock 2 on Steam, then you will receive the remastered versions upon their release. However, things are a bit more complicated for those with Games for Windows Live copies. For the original Bioshock you will need to submit a ticket to 2k Support with a scan of the original receipt, a confirmation email or some other way to prove your purchase is valid. Getting the remastered version of Bioshock 2 is not quite that complicated. Simply enter your Games for Windows Live key into Steam, and the game will be added to your library. If you want to play the original version of their game, both the remastered and original will be in your library. The single Steam listing for each game also includes both versions. Bioshock Infinite is not included in the remasters on PC “because it already meets current-gen console standards and runs smoothly on high visual settings.” Bioshock: The Collection releases for PS4 and Xbox One on September 13th, while the Steam versions will go live on September 15th at 3 PM PT. Total Storage Space: BioShock: 25 GB BioShock 2: 25 GB BioShock Infinite: 20 GB Total for all three games: 70 GB Minimum System Specs: OS: Windows 7 Service Pack 1 64-bit Processor: Intel E6750 Core 2 Duo 2.66 GHz / AMD Athlon X2 2.7 GHZ Memory: 4 GB GPU: DirectX11 Compatible, AMD Radeon HD 7770 / Nvidia GeForce GTX 560 Recommended System Specs: OS: Windows 7 Service Pack 1 64-bit Processor: 3 GHz Quad-Core Memory: 8 GB Video Card: 2 GB ATI Radeon HD 7970, 2GB Nvidia GeForce GTX 770 or better   3127240-3109607-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio1_lighthouse 3127240-3109607-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio1_lighthouse 3127244-3109611-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio1_welcome-to-rapture 3127244-3109611-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio1_welcome-to-rapture 3127247-3109614-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio2_bs-fight 3127247-3109614-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio2_bs-fight 3127246-3109613-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio2_adonis-luxury-resort 3127246-3109613-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio2_adonis-luxury-resort 3127243-3109610-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio1_shock-water 3127243-3109610-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio1_shock-water 3127242-3109609-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio1_mr-bubbles 3127242-3109609-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio1_mr-bubbles 3127241-3109608-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio1_ls-harvest 3127241-3109608-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio1_ls-harvest 3127239-3109606-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio1_eves-garden 3127239-3109606-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio1_eves-garden 3127238-3109605-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio1_eve-injection 3127238-3109605-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio1_eve-injection 3127237-3109604-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio1_bees 3127237-3109604-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio1_bees 3127236-3109603-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio1_bd-fight-2 3127236-3109603-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio1_bd-fight-2 3127235-3109602-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio1_bd-fight 3127235-3109602-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio1_bd-fight Related Recent Posts Pokemon Sun & Moon: Unlock Entries & Locations With 454 QR Codes Before You Buy – Dishonored 2 Dishonored 2 to Get New Game Plus and Custom Difficulty Pokemon Sun & Moon: Z-Crystal Locations | Z-Moves Unlock Guide Watch Dogs 2 – Before You Buy ↑ ABOUT Copyright 2010-2016 Gameranx.

Also worrying is quantum computing, which is inching closer to reality and promises to compromise many core cybersecurity technologies. Increasing user concern about whaling and the migration to Microsoft Office 365 cloud applications are driving strong demand for Mimecast solutions that led the company to deepen its investment in the Australian market. This is little surprise given that executives believe security of cloud data is even more important than the user experience of those services. Yet the cloud shift is also seeing new forms of ransomware and other attacks that are being answered with new spearphishing-detection tools. Yet despite all the scanners in the world, cybersecurity defences must always consider the human aspect of information security, experts continue to warn even as a high-profile investigative journalist warned that cybercriminals were undergoing a cyber criminal mind shift with implications for how CISOs defend their networks. Such issues also have implications for the oft-cited security skills gap, although Telstra says it's not that hard to find skilled people if you get a bit creative. This, as the FBI arrested two hackers for stealing information on senior government officials – and as a US government audit found that the massive Office of Personnel Management (OPM) hack could have been avoided and experts weighed in on security requirements for that country's upcoming election. The US investigated Russia on allegations that it was trying to hack that election, even as US president Barack Obama was bragging about the US government's cybersupremacy – which was seemingly reiterated by confirmation that the US did hack the Elysée Palace in 2012 – but reiterated his concerns about a cyber-arms race. Presidential contender Donald Trump had no such scruples, calling for the US to expand its cybersecurity capabilities as part of a broad expansion of the military. Yet all US government agencies already face a requirement for stronger and more proactive cybersecurity capabilities, after data-protection guidelines were updated for the first time in over a decade – providing guidance for Australian companies charting their strategic security direction. The Xen Project patched serious flaws in its virtualisation software while a bug in Sophos antivirus malware scanners triggered false positives on a critical Windows file, while Google offered a three-level Android patch that some worried could cause user confusion. Also confused were Web site owners who have been wondering why their site rankings have been dropping – and it's often thanks to changes in Google Safe Browsing technology. Google is also moving to mark HTTP connections as insecure in a subtle push to Web site owners to jump on the HTTPS bandwagon that will kick off in January. There were suggestions that half of network management systems are vulnerable to cross-site scripting and SQL injection attacks, even as one security firm found itself in the legal crosshairs on allegations of a stock-tanking tactic in which the security firm claimed key medical products could be hacked in order to fund a short-selling scheme. Read more The cyber security skills crisis and the burning platform for change Intel moved to sell off its majority stake in its McAfee security unit, partnering with investment firm TPG to respawn the former McAfee security company – although original founder John McAfee may be ready to put a spanner in the works. An audit of connected device security found that few manufacturers are taking it seriously, while reports from the field suggested that end users are equally lax when it comes to security as 99 percent of compromised user accounts come from password reuse. Many others are also surfacing as data hoarders revive and rework massive data sets compromised in breaches years ago.

Here’s Why the Water Is So Dangerous TIME Tech the big picture 7 Reasons the Tech Sector Is Set for Explosive Growth Tim Bajarin @bajarin Sept. 12, 2016 SHARE Sascha Schuermann—Getty Images A Visitor try out a VR game at the Sony Play Station stand at the Gamescom 2016 gaming trade fair during the media day on August 17, 2016 in Cologne, Germany. From new wireless technologies to innovations in healthcare As a technology researcher, I’m often asked if tech growth has peaked, or if there is more to come. After spending lots of time thinking about this question, I’ve decided that the tech industry is in for a sea change, leading to a potential tripling of demand for tech-related goods and services over the next decade. Here are my seven reasons to be bullish about technology’s future, broken down by category. Wireless innovation A major move to build out broadband wireless networks will provide the underlying infrastructure critical for innovation in communications, the Internet of Things (which will connect lots of formerly “dumb” electronics, like air conditioners and coffee makers) and self-driving automobiles. Most importantly, wireless carriers like Verizon and AT&T will deploy so-called “5G” next-generation mobile broadband networks over the next five to ten years. Meanwhile, “mesh networks” that connect nearby devices to one another in local grids will allow for a new wave of wireless innovation in densely packed cities and other communities. Internet of Things With faster and higher-bandwidth wireless networks in place, the Internet of Things, embryonic today, will become a much bigger part of our everyday lives. In a recent report, Business Insider claimed that $6 trillion will be invested in the Internet of Things over the next five years and that there will be 24 billion IoT devices installed worldwide by 2020.   Smarter cities, smarter cars We’re already seeing moves by technology companies, city officials and other groups to put sensors and wireless cameras in light poles, embedded in street pavement, placed outside buildings, and so on. These will be important tools for urban planning and city management. They will also be crucial for the coming wave of self-driving vehicles. Over the next decade, the automotive industry will transition to various forms of self-driving vehicles. Cities around the world will be putting sensors and cameras all around their communities that will “talk” to these automobiles to enhance their navigation and crash avoidance technologies within city limits. These infrastructure build-outs, however, will take time, cost lots of money and demand the help of lots of engineers and other professionals. Data centers The fourth growth area will be in data — data centers, data analysts, and data engineers. Right now, almost every company is in need of more staff to deal with these disciplines, especially data analysis. The world’s biggest companies are collecting terabytes or petabytes of data of all types every day that needs to be searched, analyzed and used to enhance their ability to create products and services for their customers. Security Unfortunately, I predict we’ll see huge growth in the area of security technology and a high demand for security experts. It’s an area that can only grow as independent hackers and foreign actors target companies across industries, looking to steal identities, siphon corporate secrets or influence elections. Virtual and Augmented Reality We’re about to see big advancements in both of these related, yet different, fields. I have no doubt that VR and AR will revolutionize the computing experience and offer new ways to interact with technology as well as with one another. These technologies are in their early stages, but they will bring new jobs and new levels of innovation to the computing experience over the next decade. Healthcare The digitization of health information will open new markets for health-related devices, from fitness trackers for consumers to hospital-grade tech. At every level of the healthcare system, digital technology will become more important for making diagnoses, managing patient records, preventing disease and so on. As one who has tracked the tech market for the last 35 years and seen its tremendous growth along with its bleaker periods, I think we’re about to see a major boom period.

James Henderson (New Zealand Reseller News) 12 September, 2016 20:23 - - - - print email Comments A new network aimed at sensing and controlling the physical world has been launched in Rarotonga, Cook Islands. The purpose-built public wireless network for the Internet of Things is a result of Bluesky Cook Islands working with New Zealand’s KotahiNet, in a bid to run network in the north of Rarotonga before covering the entire island. “Cook Islands can greatly benefit from being able to get real-time data about the physical world with cheap and ubiquitous connectivity,” Bluesky Cook Islands country manager, Phillip Henderson, said. “There are a large variety of potential uses- from smart electricity monitoring to better understanding the environment to knowing the location of everything. “To help people understand the benefits and opportunities this new technology provides, there will be no charge for testing or connecting a few sensors to the Internet. “We are happy to work with KotahiNet on setting up the public wireless network. They bring experience and skills of value to the Cook Islands.” KotahiNet has been operating a similar network in New Zealand for about a year and currently covers over half the country’s population. “The vision for KotahiNet is to help unlock the benefits of smart products and services that operate in the physical world,” KotahiNet director, Vikram Kumar, added. “These services use real-time data, collective intelligence, and analytics. In addition, we are building connected products that demonstrate the benefits of this new technology.” Read more ​Internet of Things onslaught underway as devices set to outnumber users For Kumar, the opportunity to work with Bluesky Cook Islands brings the benefit of wireless connectivity for real-time data quickly and economically to Rarotonga, leading the way in the Pacific Islands. “Using the open network model from the LoRa Alliance, called LoRaWAN, is particularly well suited,” he explained. “It allows sensors and other smart devices to communicate over long distances, yet the battery life can be typically 5-10 years. “By operating using the LoRaWAN specification for the European Union of 868 MHz, it allows buying sensors and other smart devices off the shelf. This means Rarotonga can tap into global suppliers and take advantage of scale economies.” Read More: ​EDGE 2016: Intel investigates the 'Vortex of Change' impacting the channel ​Kordia and Thinxtra Internet of Things network passes half-way NZ mark Brand Post Ingram Micro Showcase 2016: Aimed to Provide a Transformative Technology Experience More from Ingram Micro New Zealand Follow Us Twitter LinkedIn Join the New Zealand Reseller News newsletter!

Hacking attempts of voting machines and leaked emails could alter the trajectory of the presidential campaign in its final weeks.  Alan Diaz, AP Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email As U.S. officials explore whether Russia is trying to tamper with the presidential election, states are grappling with how to secure their systems and prevent cyberattacks between now and Election Day. Arizona and Illinois have already experienced attempted hacks of their voter databases and last week, U.S. officials said they are expanding their inquiry because investigators believe additional states have also seen hackers successfully probe their election systems. Officials have not publicly said yet who they believe was behind the Arizona and Illinois breaches, but as was the case with the Democratic National Committee (DNC) hack, Russia is suspected to be responsible. Play Video CBSN Feds widen probe into hacks of state election systems Law enforcement officials have expanded their probe into cyber hacks of state election systems amid reports that more states were hacked. CBS New... More than a half-dozen cybersecurity experts CBS News spoke to said it’s clear Russia, which has among the best hackers in the world, is trying to influence the U.S. election and that the chances of more cyberattacks between now and Election Day are high. Voter registration or voter roll databases might be one piece of election systems that could be susceptible to further attacks, experts told CBS. Officials in Arizona and Illinois said voters’ information was not meddled with, but it could be problematic if they break into the system and delete files. “The real danger is whether they can delete voter registrations,” said Herbert Lin, a senior research scholar for cyber policy and security at Stanford University’s Center for International Security and Cooperation. “Let’s say they wanted to intervene on the side of [Donald] Trump. Then what you would do is find a way of invalidating the voter registrations, deleting the voter registrations of 10 percent of the Democrats in the state. That would make 10 percent of them ineligible to vote.” Theoretically, another type of advanced attack, experts said, would be to target and modify software for voting machines so that it could affect what names are displayed or how votes are counted, though experts believe this would be too tricky to execute. “You could, in theory, hack into that software and change it so that it would tally something differently. But again, those types of things are really hard to do just in terms of actually doing it, and doing it in an undetected way is much, much more difficult,” said Daniel Castro, vice president at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. Some experts are concerned about states that use touch-screen voting machines that leave no paper trail. Five states are completely paperless: Delaware, Georgia, Louisiana, New Jersey and South Carolina. Nine other states have some counties that use paperless systems: Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia.   States are already on the look-out for possible insecurities. Last week, Washington state revealed that its online tool that allows voters to register, update personal information and view a voter guide was accidentally accessible through the website’s development code. There was never a “security breach” or “hack of the voter system,” the secretary of state’s office said in an advisory, and it was quickly fixed. But the incident reinforces concerns that state election systems could be vulnerable to potential cyberattacks. Experts told CBS News that the ultimate goal of these hackers is not to necessarily change the outcome of the election; their main objective is to de-legitimize the outcome by sowing doubt, uncertainty and suspicion through a series of cyberattacks. “I would argue that this is one of the most significant cyber attacks that, to my knowledge, has ever been conducted against the United States. The attackers are trying to undermine the trust in the electoral process,” said Alexander Klimburg, associate at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, and author of a forthcoming book called The Dark Web. “The challenge in cyber operations is that the only limitation in what you can do is your own creativity,” Klimburg said. “Whatever you can imagine doing is pretty much possible in cyber terms.” So far, Obama administration officials have made no clear-cut statement either identifying the Russian government as being behind the cyberattacks or threatening retaliation. But Russian President Vladimir Putin, in an interview last week with Bloomberg denied that his government had anything directly to do with the DNC hack. “I don’t know anything about it, and on a state level Russia has never done this,” he said. The Department of Homeland Security has offered states support and assistance in protecting against cyberattacks. Beside the general security recommendations made to make systems more secure, like changing passwords and installing firewalls, one expert said the most important action states can take is performing full compromise assessments to determine if a network has already been intruded and monitoring all computers on a network that have anything to do with vote tallying or the transfer of voter registration information. Experts stress that hackers might not intend to use these attacks to sway the election -- in Trump’s favor, for example -- but they are part of Russia’s long-term strategy to challenge Western democracy and to disrupt and weaken the U.S. political system. “They’ve already achieved some of their goal,” said James Lewis, senior vice president and director of the strategic technologies program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). “When they get closer to November, they’ll want to keep up the pressure, keep up the confusion. They’ll probably look for ways, if Trump loses, to plant information or create leads that suggest somehow the election is rigged.” Trump has repeatedly warned that the election might be “rigged” and said in an interview with Larry King last week that it’s “pretty unlikely” that Russia would interfere​. But Lewis said he believes Russia is behind the DNC attack and intrusions at the state level and said there are a couple of factors that are likely motivating these hackers. “Some of the goals are to see if you can drive a wedge between the U.S. and Europe and some of it is just grudge match,” he said. “They still haven’t forgiven us for what happened at the end of the Cold War.” But FBI Director James Comey said last Thursday that any cyberattacks won’t affect the outcome of the 2016 race because it would be too complicated to attack the nation’s diverse voting systems on a large scale. “The actual vote counting is clunky,” Comey said. “In a way, that is a blessing because it makes it more resilient and farther away from an actor who might be looking to crawl down a fiber optic cable.” Dmitri Alperovitch is the founder and chief technology officer of CrowdStrike, which has been investigating the hacks at the DNC and DCCC, and that identified two groups, linked to Russian intelligence agencies G.R.U. and F.S.B., infiltrated the DNC independent of each other. While Alperovitch agrees that Russia is trying to mainly cause havoc in the U.S. election system, he said “we can’t discount the possibility” that hackers could actually change the outcome of the race. “If it’s close, and if it’s really going to come down to a few votes in a few counties, sort of similar to the 2000 Bush vs. Gore race, then you don’t need to hack into every state and every county,” he said. “You may need to do one hack and swing a few hundred votes.” Since states and local jurisdictions run elections and use different systems, some experts and officials say its decentralized nature could in itself protect against a large-scale attack. But the fact that there isn’t a universal system to hack into also presents a downside. “What that means from an attacker’s point of view is you can look through every state in the nation and look for the ones that have some weaknesses,” said Steve Grobman, chief technology officer of Intel Security. “There’s an incredible advantage for the adversary here in that it’s not like there’s one locked door that is built out of the field that they have to figure out how to penetrate. They basically have 50 doors that are made from all sorts of different vendors and all sorts of different technologies and they can wiggle them all, look at them all, and find the loosest one.” It would be difficult, however, to manipulate the vote broadly, Grobman said. Instead, Grobman said his top concern is how they could influence the election before Election Day in which hackers would release authentic data and intertwine it with data that they would fabricate, giving it the appearance of it all being believable. “One of my concerns is that this is exactly what would happen in the election cycle where late in October, we would see a release of data that would have some piece of damning content that would potentially influence the outcome of the election and...people would assume it’s credible, especially if it’s intertwined with authentic, stolen data,” he said. “The problem would be there wouldn’t be enough time to research and validate that it would be a fabrication.” “The Russians are going to decide the Americans are still ambivalent about how to respond to us,” Lewis said about the latest comments from key administration officials, “And they’ll see that as a greenlight.” Asked what the chances are of Russia taking more action -- undetected or detected -- before the election, Lewis said, “100 percent.”  © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

The design centres on the colour red (or vermello as Snapdeal puts it) and is being marketed with the tagline 'Unbox Zindagi'. The red and blue logo is replaced by a vermello-coloured box, as Snapdeal looks to reposition its strategy, expand its reach, and be more consumer-centric. Snapdeal claims that with its brand repositioning, it is looking to upgrade its customer care services as well. The branding is done across the ecosystem, and the app has also been redesigned. The company claims that even the delivery boxes have been remodelled with the new logo and vermello colour. Snapdeal says it has invested more than Rs. 200 crore in this rebranding move, and the campaign involves big names like Prasoon Joshi and his team at Mcann, as well as musical trio Shankar Ehsaan Loy. This move comes just ahead of the big shopping season, and Snapdeal looks to gear up for competing with fellow e-commerce giants Amazon and Flipkart."With this new positioning, we also focus on the next phase of our growth, as we seek to engage with the next 100 million online shoppers from all parts of an increasingly connected India," Kunal Bahl, Co-founder and CEO, Snapdeal, said in a statement. Snapdeal was started in 2010, and is now backed by SoftCorp Bank, Tybourne Capital, Alibaba Group, Temasek Holdings, Foxconn Technology Group, eBay, Nexus Ventures, Intel Capital, and even Ratan Tata. In this hyper-competitive market, Snapdeal looks to stay relevant and this rebranding strategy is the e-commerce giant's latest bet to tap new audience. Snapdeal recently introduced Snapdeal Gold, a program designed to discourage use of cash-on-delivery and its own take on services like Amazon Prime and Flipkart First.

Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) Sep 11, 2016 at 1:41PM Image source: Getty Images. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is certainly an alluring company right now. Its shares have gained more than 100% year-to-date, with much of the bullish sentiment riding on the growing popularity and opportunity behind virtual reality. To help put the recent stock run in perspective -- and to point out some potential pitfalls at the company -- let's take a look at three charts that paint a fuller picture of AMD and the state of its business. Revenue has fallen fast, but it's improving Longtime AMD shareholders will know that the company's revenue has been anything but encouraging over the past few years. Since 2014, the top line has declined by about 39% from its high. Data by YCharts. The main reason for the decline came from slowing sales of AMD's PC processors, particularly in notebooks. PC chips are among the company's biggest revenue drivers, and a slowdown in the PC market over the past few years has hurt AMD tremendously. Despite the bad times, the company is starting to see revenue growth return, thanks to increased demand for chips and a new licensing deal with Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology. The latter adds about $52 million to AMD's revenue this year, while the former should help the company's long-term prospects. AMD certainly isn't out of the woods yet, and investors will need to see the company deliver on promising new chips (like its upcoming Zen processor for servers) and new GPUs to see if the recent rebound is sustainable.  This is changing AMD's focus  A couple of years ago, the company highlighted a few key areas that it would pursue in order to turn around its business. One of those areas of focus is what the company calls immersive platforms, which include PC components and the growing augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) markets.  The total addressable market for immersive platforms is $20 billion, according to the company, and much of that will come from the AR and VR segments.  AMD CTO Mark Papermaster highlighted the company's focus on boosting VR adoption rates in a recent interview with TechRadar, saying: At AMD, we frankly aim to directly impact that adoption rate. That's why, for instance, we brought that $200 price point for the RX 480. That broke the paradigm -- that is a VR-ready graphics card. You can have a wonderful VR experience, 90 frames per second, very low latency with that graphics card. The graph below shows exactly why AMD is pinning some of its future revenue prospects on the AR and VR markets -- because they'll be worth potentially $150 billion by 2020. Image source: Digi-Capital. AR and VR certainly aren't the only markets that AMD is focusing on, of course, but with immersive platforms marked as one of the top three focuses for the company over the next few years, it's clear the company is expecting its GPUs to be a major part of its growth story. This stock is on the move  It's hard to write an article showing some of the most important AMD charts without including the company's massive bull run this year. The stock has already more than doubled in 2016, with a nearly 220% gain over the past 12 months.   Data by YCharts. Management and shareholders hope that the upcoming Zen release could steal some of the $18 billion server market away from rival Intel. The company says it has already secured several design wins with original equipment manufacturers and that it will officially launch the chip in the first half of 2017. The bottom line AMD certainly has a lot going for it in the GPU, VR, and PC markets -- management is wisely pursuing new areas of growth and re-entering markets where they believe the company can succeed (like server processors). But without stable revenue, the incredible share price gains would make me hesitant to invest in the company right now. It definitely appears that there are brighter days ahead for the company, but investors should be careful not to overestimate the success AMD will enjoy based on such early efforts with little to show for them.  Chris Neiger has no position in any stocks mentioned.
