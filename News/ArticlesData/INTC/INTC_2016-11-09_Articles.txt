Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 10, 2016 at 6:11PM Per a new report from DigiTimes, which cites "sources from motherboard makers," microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is "planning to add USB 3.1 and Wi-Fi into its motherboard chipsets."  Dr. Venkata (Murthy) Renduchintala, president of Intel's client and Internet of Things businesses as well as its systems architecture group. Image source: Intel.  That integration, the report says, could arrive with Intel's "upcoming 300-series [chipsets] scheduled to be released at the end of 2017." Although this might not seem like much, it's a big deal. Here's why. Intel could gain significant Wi-Fi share, boost revenue content Back at Intel's 2015 investor meeting, former Intel client computing group (CCG) chief Kirk Skaugen told analysts that the company's long-term goal was to pursue a strategy of "intelligent integration" of key functionality into its platforms (processors and chipsets). USB 3.1 integration doesn't come as much of a surprise; current sixth- and seventh-generation Core processor chipsets integrate support for USB 3.0, and adoption of the newer, zippier USB 3.1 technology is the natural next step for the chipmaker. The more interesting thing here is that Intel might get Wi-Fi integrated into next-generation chipsets. Intel has long been a major vendor of stand-alone Wi-Fi modules, with around 40% share of Wi-Fi chips sold into personal computers. By building Wi-Fi capability directly into its chipsets, Intel positions itself to do two things: Grow its share of Wi-Fi in the overall personal computer market (both desktop and notebook). Increase adoption of Wi-Fi in the desktop personal computer market, potentially boosting more dollar content in desktop personal computers. Let's take a closer look at each of these. It's hard to beat integration The key reason for a chip company to integrate the functionality that was once handled by two stand-alone chips into one is simple: cost reduction. When a stand-alone chip is manufactured, a silicon die needs to be created, and that silicon die needs to be tested and packaged. The latter two steps aren't trivial and add cost. In a solution that requires two chips, those packaging and test costs are incurred twice. By bringing the functionalities of the two chips together (in this case, a chipset and a Wi-Fi controller), the size of the chip being manufactured increases, but the costs that are duplicated when two chips are manufactured are only incurred once. This means that Intel could be able to offer integrated Wi-Fi for cheaper than what a competitor would be able to deliver with a stand-alone solution. With a cheaper, more integrated solution at hand, it might become very tough for Intel's competitors in Wi-Fi chipsets to compete. Beyond the share gains, though, the integration of Wi-Fi directly into Intel's chipsets (which are required for an Intel processor to function) could drive adoption of Wi-Fi significantly up in desktop computers. Some desktop motherboards today include stand-alone Wi-Fi chips as premium options, but certainly not the majority. With key Wi-Fi technology built into every Intel desktop chipset, more desktop motherboard makers may be more interested in adding the remaining components to their motherboard designs to enable Wi-Fi functionality.

This new Intel technology seems quite interesting, but it might not be the game-changer in this particular instance. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 10, 2016 at 6:06PM Analyst Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna Financial Group, by way of Barron's, recently described a new Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) chip technology as both "mind-blowing" and "miraculous." Intel data-center chief Diane Bryant holding a silicon photonics module. Image source: Intel.  The technology Rolland is referring to is a "miniaturized on-die version" of Intel's silicon photonics technology that's "used as a super high-speed optical interconnect between a Xeon server CPU and an Altera FPGA." Rolland says this technology will allow Intel to build "best-in-class CPU/FPGA combinations proprietary to Intel." Here's why I'm not as enthusiastic as Rolland is about that technology being used for this application. Intel's Altera end game Back in March, Intel said it would begin offering samples of chips with Xeon processors and FPGA chips from Altera, now Intel Programmable Solutions Group, integrated onto the same chip package later in the year. Putting the two chips onto the same package does deliver some efficiency improvements over connecting two discrete components -- say, an FPGA via a PCI Express link -- on the order of two times. However, Intel has indicated that it can do better. Intel's end-game vis-a-vis Altera's FPGA technology is to take Altera's core FPGA technology and build it into the same piece of silicon as the main processor. By integrating the technologies into a single silicon die, rather than as two distinct dies on the same package, Intel expects to be able to realize further performance and power efficiency benefits compared with what a co-packaged part can deliver. It's hard to see how a technology that allows two discrete chips to communicate data more quickly -- when eventually the FPGA and the CPU will both be in the same piece of silicon -- will eliminate the need for a "super high-speed optical interconnect between a Xeon server CPU and an Altera FPGA." Putting Intel's silicon photonics efforts into perspective Even if Intel's silicon photonics technology isn't a big deal for the company's combination CPU and FPGA parts, the technology seems to represent a significant opportunity for Intel. At Intel's late 2015 investor meeting, Intel data-center group chief Diane Bryant said that by 2020, the total addressable market for the company's silicon photonics technology will be approximately $5 billion. It's not clear how much of that revenue opportunity Intel will be able to capture by that time. However, even 20% of that would be about $1 billion in incremental revenue for the company's data-center group. Considering that Intel's data-center business generated about $16 billion in revenue during 2015, an extra $1 billion in revenue is by no means chump change.  We should get an update on this tech in February Intel is planning to host an investor meeting in early February of next year. At this event, the company is likely to delve deeply into what kind of growth rate it expects in its data-center group over the next several years. It'll be interesting to learn management's current sales and market-share expectations around silicon photonics for both the near term and the longer term, as Intel reportedly began volume shipments of silicon photonics products earlier this year.

Intel Publishes Open-Source Graphics Driver Code For Bringing Up "Geminilake" Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 10 November 2016 at 10:25 AM EST. 5 Comments Coming out this morning from the Intel Open-Source Technology Center is their initial hardware enablement code for the future "Geminilake" hardware with their Linux graphics driver stack. Geminilake (also referred to as "Gemini Lake" within early reports of this future hardware) is the successor to Apollo Lake and will be 4~6 Watt SoCs. This Linux driver code coming out today is for enabling the graphics on Geminilake. According to earlier leaks, Geminilake isn't expected to be released until Q4'2017 or even early 2018. This just continues Intel's usual trend of getting out their open-source Linux support code early so it can be refined and work its way into the mainline Linux kernel, Mesa, etc, well ahead of the product's debut so there is good out-of-the-box support in Linux distributions by the time products are shipping. Bringing up Geminilake within the Intel DRM kernel driver is only 508 lines of new code (138 deletions), so it's not too big of a difference over all the code so far for Skylake/Kabylake/Apollolake in there right now and built off the Broxton code-paths. Further reinforcing not many changes compared to the current graphics driver code, Gemini Lake is still considered a "gen9lp" platform. The only Geminilake PCI IDs added so far for graphics are 0x3184 and 0x3185 but presumably more will be added later. Overall, no real secrets in digging through the early enablement code as it's mostly just adapting to use the Broxton and Skylake code already written and then just some changes around initialization, etc, and then some minor changes like Gemini Lake has four planes per pipe. Great to see Intel continuing to get this next-generation code out there early and will presumably see the initial support land for Linux 4.10~4.11 cycles. 5 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 10, 2016 at 7:22AM Next year, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is expected to release a new family of powerful processors targeted at high-end desktop and enthusiast users known as Skylake-X. Skylake-X is expected to be based on a slightly modified, data-center-specific variant of the Skylake processor core that made its debut in late 2015 in notebooks, desktops, and notebook/tablet hybrids. Image source: Intel.  Thanks to leaks from BenchLife.info, we know we can expect these key differences between the Skylake-X series of high-end desktop processors and the 2015 Skylake-S family of desktop processors: Skylake-X should be available in six-, eight-, and 10-core options; Skylake-S tops out at four. Skylake-X will include up to 44 lanes of PCI Express connectivity, useful for hooking up multiple graphics cards, PCI Express-based storage drives, and so on. Skylake-S includes just 16 lanes of PCI Express connectivity. Skylake-X will probably be manufactured in Intel's newer, higher-performance 14-nanometer+ technology; Skylake-S was manufactured in Intel's lower-performance first-generation 14-nanometer tech. We've also learned from BenchLife.info, which has been the primary source for leaks pertaining to Skylake-X, that Intel has begun sampling these processors in advance of next year's launch. When will Skylake-X be released? An earlier leak from BenchLife.info showed that Intel originally intended to launch Skylake-X in the second quarter of 2017. However, a later leak showed that this schedule had been pushed out, with production shipments expected to begin in the third quarter of 2017, with a formal launch sometime in either the third or fourth quarters of 2017. So assuming the leaks are accurate, and BenchLife.info is usually reliable, it's unlikely that Intel will release the Skylake-X processors until the second half of 2017. What Intel will be selling in the meantime For the very high-end desktop market, it would appear that Intel's workhorses through the first half of 2017 will be the Broadwell-E series of processors launched back in May of this year. That's a bummer, because the enthusiast and gaming personal-computer market is one of the few sub-segments of the total personal computer market that's not only growing but also appreciates better, faster processors. All's not lost for the enthusiast and gaming sub-segment of the personal computer market, though. Intel is expected to launch its more "mainstream" enthusiast parts, known as the Core i7 7700K and the Core i5 7600K, in January. Accompanying those new processors will be a new platform that Intel refers to as Z270, which should add more system-level features. These two parts are based on the company's Kaby Lake processor architecture. Kaby Lake, as Intel has explained on several occasions, uses the same basic architectural design as Skylake. The performance improvement, at least in CPU tasks, is expected to come entirely from these chips' ability to run at higher frequencies (measured in gigahertz) than their Skylake-based predecessors, thanks to the use of an improved 14-nanometer+ technology to build the newer processors. This lineup should still be competitive and is likely to competently serve the company's gaming and enthusiast business during the first half of 2017. However, the product lineup Intel will be selling during the second half of 2017 should be much more exciting to the gaming and enthusiast community than the first-half lineup.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

OpenSUSE Tumbleweed Lands Mesa 13.0 Written by Michael Larabel in SUSE on 10 November 2016 at 07:46 AM EST. Add A Comment Those rolling on openSUSE Tumbleweed can run the latest package updates to switch from Mesa 12 to the recently-released Mesa 13. By moving up to Mesa 13 is a plethora of improvements and new features including the RADV Vulkan driver, OpenGL 4.5 for Intel, nearly complete OpenGL 4.4/4.5 for RadeonSI/NVC0, performance improvements, and more. The Intel Vulkan driver can be found on openSUSE via the libvulkan_intel sub-package but it doesn't appear that there is the RADV Radeon Vulkan driver packaged/enabled by default yet. Other recent Tumbleweed rolling-release updates include the latest Linux 4.8 point release, KDE Plasma 5.8.3, a Wayland crash fix, updated BusyBox, and more.

Home Entertainment BellaNaija Ladun Liadi Linda Ikeji Nigerian Newspapers Daily Times Guardian Newspaper National Mirror Punch Newspaper The Nation Newspaper Nigerian Pilot Newspaper Vanguard Newspaper Nigeria News PM News Premium Times TV Stations Channels TV Lagos Television TVC News TV Continental Videos Music Videos Notjustok Tooxclusive News Videos YOHAIG Think YOruba HAusa IGbo NPA set to clear abandoned vessels in Eastern ports Posted November 10, 2016 9:52 am by admin Comments Nigerian Ports Authority The Board of Directors, Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) has decided to clear to safe anchorage abandoned vessels disrupting the operations of Integrated Oil and Gas Free Zone (Intels) in and other concessionaires in Eastern ports. The Chairman of the Board, Mr Emmanuel Adesoye, disclosed this on completion of a facility tour of Onne Port by the Board members on Thursday. The abandoned vessels obstructing the operations of Intel’s belong to a company whose operations had been taken over by Assets Management Company (AMCOM). Adesoye said that the management of NPA would try to move all abandoned vessels in various terminals to safe anchorage to improve the operations of concessionaires and increase government revenue. He suggested that Intel’s should dialogue with NPA and the owner of the abandoned vessels to see if there would be alternative ways of evacuating the abandoned vessels. Adesoye said that NPA would also consult to seek ideas on how to go about it. The Board chairman commended the efforts of Intel’s, being one of the indigenous companies in the oil and Gas Free Zone, adding that the company’s operations also provided job opportunities for many NIgerians. Adesoye, however, promised that both the Board and the Management of NPA would do their best to enable indigenous investors in Oil and Gas Free Zone to sustain the business and generate more revenue for government. He said that there should be opportunities for other operators who would like to be on the same level with Intels in order to make Nigerian ports more competitive to achieve the status of being the hub in the West and Central Africa. The Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Intel’s, Mr Adamu Abubakar, urged the Board members of NPA to assist the company to access all spaces allocated for its operations in Calabar port. Abubakar suggested for dialogue among NPA,, Intels and ASCOM in order to quickly move abandoned vessels in its terminal in Calabar. He urged the Board to look into the activities of some private jetty operators who were struggling for cargoes that belong to Intels. “Intel’s pays six dollars per tonnage while other operators pay one dollar per tonnage. “Intel’s paid 10.3 million dollars for entry fee for oil and gas cargoes, while other operators paid between 1.1 to 2 million dollars as entry fee to operate general cargoes. “The jetty operators who paid entry fees for general cargoes are not struggling oil and gas cargos with Intel’s,” Abubakar said. He said that in 1982, NPA invited the private sector to operate at the Federal Lighter Terminal and also awarded concession for FLT B and Federal Ocean Terminal A in Onne as well as Terminal B in Warri and Terminal A Calabar for 25 years, which were renewable. Abubakar said that Intels Nigeria Ltd. had concession agreement from 2005 to 2031 on consolidated lease agreement in FLT B, Warri New Terminal, Warri Old Terminal and Calabar Port Terminal A. He described Intels as an indigenous private company of 85 per cent shares and expatriate share of 15 per cent. Abubakar said that Intel’s was fully committed to maximising in a sustainable manner, the use of indigenous human resources, materials, equipment and services in its operations without compromising the company’s value, quality, health, Safety of the environment. He said there was an urgent need to rehabilitate the poor road conditions leading to Onne ports. “The logistics and equipment infrastructure needs of the terminal concessioned to Intel’s require much higher investments and specialised skills, in contrast to other terminals. “These were projected to yield higher returns to the concessionaire as well as the government. “This informed the basis for fixing a higher throughput fee per tonne to be paid by concessionaires of terminals located in those ports under Intel’s at the time of concession. “Other terminal owners pay much lower fee under the concession agreement. “The fee for the terminals granted to Intel’s under Annexure was also higher compared to the much lower Commencement Fee paid by concessionaires in other terminals,’’ NAN quotes Abubakar as saying.

Yankee Analysts Home Earnings Finance Global Markets About Us Privacy Policy Quick Look at PT & Outlook for Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Time Warner Inc. (NYSE:TWX) By William Abels - November 10, 2016 SHARE Facebook Twitter Wall Street sell-side research analysts covering Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) shares have recently provided various price target projections on where the stock might be going. According to them, the stock is expected to reach $40.285 on a consensus level within the next year, according to Zacks. The most bullish estimate sees the stock reaching $46 while the most conservative estimate stand at $30. Zacks also gives an average broker rating based on the sell-side recommendations from the analysts who cover Intel Corporation. They give the company shares an ABR of 1.83. This is based on the 28 analysts taken into consideration by Zacks. Earnings Estimates for Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) Currently, Wall Street is projecting that the firm will post $0.75 earnings per share. This consensus number is also derived from Zacks. For the most recent period which ended on 2016-09-30, Intel Corporation's EPS was reported as $0.8. This created a “surprise factor” 9.59% due to being $0.07 apart from what Wall Street predicted. When actual numbers differ greatly from the consensus expectations, sharp movement in the stock price can often be seen in the hours or days following the report. Investors will mark their calendars for 2017-01-12, the date when Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) are expected to release their quarterly results. During the most recent trading session, Time Warner Inc. (NYSE:TWX) shares traded -1.45%. Tracking the stock price in relation to moving averages may provide enhanced perspective on stock performance. After a recent look, the stock has been seen trading $4.27 off of the 50-day moving average of $82.33 and $8.84 separated from the 200-day moving average of $77.76. Taking a further look from a different perspective, the stock has been recently recorded -8.30% off of the 52-week high of 94.44 and +55.95% apart from the 52-week low of 55.53. Monitoring stock price activity relative to moving averages and the highs and lows for the past year might help with future stock price value assessment.  Price Target in Focus While monitoring stock technicals is important, most investors are more concerned with where the stock might be going now.  Equity research analysts have provided views on where they believe the stock will be trading in the future. According to Thomson Reuters, sell-side analysts are projecting a consensus target price of $102.45 on company shares. This is a near-term estimate for the next 12-18 months. Currently, Time Warner Inc. New Common Sto has a price to earnings ratio of 17.23. Analysts and investors may also opt to evaluate a company's PEG or price to earnings growth ratio. The stock currently has a PEG Ratio of 1.24.

Though the tech giant has not confirmed the development or the existence of the Surface Pro 5, speculations and alleged leaks about the device are abounding. As far as the nature of the device’s rumors is concerned, the upcoming hybrid seems poised to dominate the hybrid portable enterprise device market next year. The Surface Pro has had a pretty colorful history, starting with the Surface RT four years ago. When Microsoft unveiled the hybrid device to an iPad-saturated market four years ago, many were quick to dismiss Microsoft’s efforts as unremarkable. Despite the rocky start, however, Microsoft muscled on, eventually culminating in the release of the Surface Pro 4 last year, a device that has largely been acclaimed both critically and commercially. Speculations about the Surface Pro 5, the follow-up to the successful Surface Pro 4, are very encouraging, with rumors pointing to Microsoft releasing a hybrid device that is equipped with Intel’s Kaby Lake processors ranging from the entry-level Core m3 to the high-end Core i7 chip. All signs so far, including Microsoft’s decision to seemingly release the Surface Pro 5 early 2017 instead of late 2016, appears to target the release of Intel’s latest processor. With Kaby Lake chips, the Surface Pro 5 would stand far beyond that of its competition, especially the upcoming Apple iPad Pro 2, which is also rumored to be released sometime early 2017. [Image by Intel Free Press|Wikimedia Commons|Cropped and Resized|CC BY-SA 2.0] Microsoft has never really shied away from equipping the Surface line of hybrid devices with the best processors currently available in the industry. With Kaby Lake processors, 4k video processing would be native to the Surface Pro 5. Such power would place the device far beyond the iPad Pro 2’s powerful albeit ARM-based mobile-class processor. While the iPad Pro 2 would undoubtedly receive a huge boost in power compared to its predecessor, the power discrepancy between Apple’s homegrown mobile chip and Intel’s premium line of desktop-grade processors is very significant. Couple this with the rumored storage and memory options for the Surface Pro 5 and Apple’s iPad Pro 2 would definitely appear to be in trouble. Speculations point to the Surface Pro 5 being equipped with as much as 1TB of storage and 16GB of RAM, while Apple’s 12.9-inch iPad Pro currently tops at 256GB of storage and 4GB of RAM. Even if Apple steps up its specs to about 512GB of storage and 6GB of RAM, it would still be a long way away from the Surface Pro 5. After all, Apple’s strategy over the years has been to release incremental upgrades for each device’s iteration. Thus, even a 12.9-inch iPad Pro with 512GB of storage and 6GB of RAM is already stretching it. One thing that would definitely give the Surface Pro 5 a definitive edge over the iPad Pro 2 is the operating system used in the two devices. The Surface line has always been equipped with the full desktop-grade version of Microsoft’s operating system. Thus, the Surface Pro 5 would undoubtedly run the latest, most advanced iteration of Windows 10. On the other hand, the iPad Pro 2 would most likely still run iOS, a mobile operating system. This severely cripples the device, since even basic tasks such as working on multiple MS Word documents would prove tricky on the iPad Pro 2. [Image by 精選 好東西 熊老闆|Flickr|Cropped and Resized|CC BY-SA 2.0] Apple has recently asserted that it would not be merging iOS and its desktop-grade operating system, macOS. Thus, with the iPad Pro 2 being a tablet-class device, it would be crippled by the limitations of iOS. Of course, if Apple takes a step out of the box and releases the iPad Pro 2 with macOS Sierra, it would be a completely different story. However, the chances of that happening are fairly low. When Microsoft first released the Surface line of devices, it decided to take a step away from convention and gamble on something that was, up to that day, largely uncharted territory. Apple, on the other hand, has been playing it safe for years now. With the inevitable bout between the Surface Pro 5 and the iPad Pro 2 in 2017, Apple would need to really dig deep in order to best, or at least match, the Microsoft Surface Pro 5. If any, fans of powerful portable devices might not need to wait very long, as rumors indicate that the release date for both the Surface Pro 5 and the iPad Pro 2 would be set for early 2017. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/imo3wQXuuTg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> [Featured Image by Scott Akerman|Flickr|Cropped and Resized|CC BY-SA 2.0] Now Watch This: Paralyzed Monkey Walks Again After Implant Now Read This: 2016 MacBook Pro With Touch Bar Gets Mixed Reviews: Is The New Microsoft Surface Book Better?

Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) Nov 9, 2016 at 6:40PM Image source: Intel. It's no secret that Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is at a crossroads. The company is looking for its next major market to sell its chips into, as sales in the PC market slow down and the company continues to struggle to gain footing in the mobile market.  Some of Intel's focus has been on positioning itself to benefit from the Internet of Things, but the company is increasingly looking to virtual reality (VR) to boost chip sales as well. And its latest move was to snatch up VR company Voke last week.  The Voke acquisition comes just eight months after Intel purchased another VR company, Replay Technologies -- and both are starting to bring Intel's larger VR strategy into view.  Why Intel wants in on VR Intel's purchase of Voke (for an undisclosed sum) is a natural fit for the company. Voke and Intel have worked together before when Voke provided the 3D video capturing hardware for the most recent New York Fashion Week, and Intel supplied the processing power.  Voke's technology combines live streams of cameras to create virtual reality experiences of live events, whether it's on a PC, tablet, smartphone, or VR headset. That tech, along with Intel's chips, allows easy integration with sports and live event broadcasting channels. Intel said in a press release that the purchase of Voke will help the companies "innovate and scale our new immersive sports business faster to bring fans the most personalized, fully immersive VR experience ever imagined and change the way networks, sports leagues and teams engage with their audiences." In addition to New York Fashion Week, Voke's technology was used for live VR streams of of the NCAA Men's Basketball Final Four and the 2016 Kabaddi World Cup. That's important because the market size for live VR experience is growing, and a Goldman Sachs report published earlier this year estimates that it will be worth $4.1 billion by 2025.  Intel went on to say, "Imagine being able to witness a slam dunk from the defender's perspective or the defensive rush from the quarterback's perspective. This kind of experience may sound futuristic, but it's closer than you think." Purchasing Voke will help Intel get a little deeper into the live VR event market, but so will its purchase of Replay Technologies. The Israel-based company joined Intel's newly created Intel Sports business after it was acquired earlier this year. The company's technology takes images captured by ultra-HD cameras placed around a stadium and created a seamless 3D image of a game, as it did for the NBA All-Star Weekend. To understand how this really works, check out how Intel used some of its 3D technology to capture Major League Baseball footage from the recent All-Star game: Video source: Intel. Intel has said that the Replay Technologies image capturing was powered by Intel-based servers, and that the system needs lots of computing power for its data-driven images and cloud computing.  The VR market size The need for more cloud-based image processing, for both Replay and the Voke technologies, could help Intel sell more of its chips. Replay's tech ran on Intel's sixth-generation Generation Intel Core processors and Intel server technology, and other similar systems could do the same. Additionally, Intel is looking to bring its own VR headset, called Project Alloy, to market as well. If it succeeds in both launching its own headset and selling more processors for VR, it'll help Intel move into the virtual reality hardware market that's expected to be $45 billion by 2025. Intel is looking for its next big win in the processor space, and it's starting to bet on live events and sports to make that happen. If the company can turn its recent purchases into sales of more processors and server technology, then they'll both be worthy investments. While it's still unclear how well Intel might do in VR, investors should be pleased that the company is looking to new and fast-growing markets to expand its processor footprint.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Apple’s new dongle-happy MacBook Pros not fully compatible with Thunderbolt 3 peripherals Apple’s new dongle-happy MacBook Pros not fully compatible with Thunderbolt 3 peripherals By Joel Hruska on November 9, 2016 at 7:30 am Comment Update (11/9/2016): We’ve heard from Plugable that there are some Thunderbolt 3 to 2 adapters that use the TPS65982 solution and still work in the MacBook Pro. Akitio has also published a list of which devices work with the MacBook Pro — and again, it’s not clear why some hardware with the 82 solution work, while others don’t. We have removed the quote from Plugable that implied no devices with the 65982 solution could connect to the new MBPs. Original Story: Well, this is a touch embarrassing. When Apple unveiled its latest MacBook Pro hardware a few weeks back, it declared that USB-C-compatible Thunderbolt 3 ports (and lots of dongles) were the future of the company’s Mac division. We disagreed with that decision, while acknowledging that yes, Apple does have a long history of sunsetting old standards and introducing new ones ahead of the rest of the industry (whether or not this situation is analogous is a topic we discussed). Now, news has surfaced that Apple’s newest MacBook Pro hardware may not be compatible with Thunderbolt 3 peripherals already on the market. First, some context: Thunderbolt 3 is the third iteration of Intel’s Thunderbolt interconnect standard and is the first version of that standard to be physically compatible with USB Type-C connectors. It debuted in early June 2015, and support began shipping with Skylake hardware towards the end of last year. Thunderbolt 3 is used in the external GPU XConnect standard jointly developed by Intel, AMD, and Razer. It’s USB-C compatible (an extremely smart move from Intel) and should be a plug-and-play solution for Apple’s MacBook Pro. After all, Thunderbolt 3 is Thunderbolt 3… right? Apparently, no — not when Apple deploys it. According to peripheral manufacturer Plugable, Intel’s Thunderbolt 3 standard specifically calls for certain TI chips to handle power delivery and alternate mode negotiation. The chip specified by Intel, and used by Plugable (and possibly the entire rest of the industry) is the TPS65982. It’s described by Texas Instruments as: “a stand-alone USB Type-C and power delivery (PD) controller providing cable-plug and orientation detection at the USB Type-C connector. Upon cable detection, the TPS65982 device communicates on the CC wire using the USB PD protocol. After successful USB PD negotiation is complete, the TPS65982 enables the appropriate power path and configures alternate mode settings for internal and (optional) external multiplexers.” According to Plugable, none of its existing hardware currently on the market is compatible with the MacBook Pro because OS X expects all devices to use the second-generation TPS65983 solution. Here’s how the company describes the problem: The version of OS X on the new MacBook Pros (late 2016) will not work with existing Thunderbolt 3 docks and adapters that were certified for Windows prior to the release of the MacBook Pro. These existing devices use first generation of TI USB-C chipset (TPS65982) in combination with Intel’s Thunderbolt 3 chipset (Alpine Ridge). Apple requires the 2nd generation TPS65983 chipset for peripherals to be compatible. Certification of solutions across different device types is still in-progress for this 2nd generation chipset. From the Plugable product line, our dual display graphics adapters for DisplayPort and HDMI (TBT3-DP2X and TBT3-HDMI2X) are affected… We’ve also postponed our TBT3-UD1 Docking Station to update to the TPS65983 chipset and re-certify to make this docking station MacBook-compatible. Our Flagship TBT3-UDV dock with Power Delivery/Charging was already planned to use the next generation controller chip from TI, and will be compatible with the 2016 Thunderbolt 3 MacBooks. Answering compatibility questions We’ve got questions in to Intel about this, but here’s what we know thus far. First, this problem appears to be specific to Thunderbolt 3 peripherals. If you have a Thunderbolt 2 device plugged into a Thunderbolt 3 port via an adapter, it seems to work fine. That limits the amount of hardware likely to be incompatible, since not that many Thunderbolt 3 peripherals have been built yet. The flip side to this, however, is that Apple appears to have asleep at the switch when it comes to the hardware already on the market. It’s one thing to be on the cutting-edge of technology, but declaring that your users are all expected to convert to a new cable standard while simultaneously releasing hardware incompatible with all of the Thunderbolt 3 hardware currently on the market is really, really dumb. What happens to Apple buyers who pulled the trigger on a MacBook Pro and some new Thunderbolt 3 peripherals at the same time? What makes all of this even stranger is that the hardware Apple isn’t supporting isn’t some random Thunderbolt 3 controller made by a third party. These are chips that are part of Intel’s own reference design for Thunderbolt 3 devices. A little digging on TI’s forums turned up several answers, including one from TI employee Brian Berner: “The TPS65983 is a special product for ThunderBolt 3 devices (for example: hard drives, docks, and monitors) that connect to ThunderBolt 3 hosts (such as tablets, notebooks, and workstations.)” That may be true, but Intel’s own release notes for its Thunderbolt 16.2.52.250 driver, released on 9/30, state: ” Added support for TI TPS65983 PD Controller in SW, SDK API and samples.” Other comments from various places in TI suggest that the TI TPS65983 controller wasn’t available until January 2016 at the very earliest. Development support for the chip was still limited to by request only as of April, and the configuration tools TI offers for other chips weren’t available until the very end of March. In short, the bulk of the evidence suggests that full support for the TPS65983 controller has taken 6-10 months to appear and was only recently added to Intel’s own SDKs. It’s also unclear what the actual difference is between the two chips. I’m certain TI is right when it calls the 983 chip a “special product,” but I’ve paged through the data sheets for the 982 and the 983 and found nothing at all to distinguish them. They have identical circuit diagrams, identical layouts, and once you correct for some small variation in verbiage, identical features. How many people are going to be harmed by this? Probably not very many. Thunderbolt 3 is new, the MacBook Pro is new, and new hardware variants will adopt the 983 chip. Nonetheless, this is something Apple could’ve entirely prevented by either supporting the 982 chip in macOS or simply telling people from stage that only new Thunderbolt 3 peripherals would be compatible with the MacBook Pro. But I suppose it was just easier to call the whole thing “courageous” and leave it at that. This isn’t going to put a shine on the new MacBook Pro systems, and it’s an absurd situation all around. The type of controller chip used inside a peripheral interconnect should be of absolutely no regard to anyone looking for a new laptop. Having to juggle which hardware is compatible with which systems when they all support the same standard is absurd. Hopefully Apple will patch support for the TPS65982 chip into macOS.

Comments By Agam Shah Follow IDG News Service | Nov 9, 2016 2:13 PM PT RELATED TOPICS Personal Technology Computer Hardware Comments It's fun to buy a drone from a store, but perhaps more satisfying to build one from scratch. Intel in December will start shipping a fully loaded drone kit to let you do just that, with all the parts including the rotors, software, 3D camera and flight controller. Intel's Aero Ready to Fly Drone kit will go on sale on the company's website. An Intel spokeperson couldn't immediately provide a price. But it won't be cheap -- likely more than $600. The quadcopter kit has parts that Intel uses to build its own drones. On the company's part, the drone airshows it has organized are getting ambitious: The company has >put up 100, and most recently, >500 drones in the sky. Drones themselves are getting sophisticated. DJI's Phantom has chips and 3D cameras that can navigate safely while avoiding collisions. The Intel Aero Ready to Fly Drone kit has the 3D RealSense camera, which can measure distances and recognize objects and help the drones, when programmed correctly, to fly autonomously to a given destination. The 3D RealSense camera attaches to a central computer called the Aero Compute Board, which gives the drone its computing horsepower. (Intel also sells the Aero Compute Board separately for $399.) It is powered by a quad-core Atom X7-Z8700 CPU code-named Cherry Trail. It also has LTE, 802.11ac Wi-Fi and a flight controller. The board also has 4GB of LPDDR3 RAM, 16GB of flash storage, a micro-SD slot, a micro-HDMI port, and a wide set of connectors for adapters and breakout boards. It also has the Altera Max 10 FPGA, which can reprogrammed for image recognition, navigation and other deep-learning tasks. The drone will work with the Airmap software development kit for navigation. Programming will also be required to put the drone in the air. For example, you can use the RealSense SDK to program image recognition for the 3D camera. An overview on how to build drones from the recent Embedded Linux Conference Europe 2016 is available on >Youtube. The kit will ship in some countries in North America, Europe and Asia. For U.S. buyers Intel has included a caveat relating to government regulations on requiring authorization to fly drones. Have fun, but be careful. If you crash a drone, you'll have to reinvest in a new kit. RELATED TOPICS Personal Technology Computer Hardware Agam Shah — U.S. Correspondent The latest in IT services?

Intel Vulkan Driver Lands Major Performance Boost, RADV Lands GPU Hang Fixes Written by Michael Larabel in Vulkan on 9 November 2016 at 03:06 PM EST. 5 Comments It's yet another exciting afternoon in Mesa Git world for both of the mainline Vulkan drivers: the Intel "ANV" Vulkan Linux driver and the unofficial "RADV" Radeon Vulkan driver. For the Intel Vulkan driver, the batch of commits hitting mainline a short time ago are the changes for doing re-locations in user-space, which leads to around a 30% performance boost at least for Skylake hardware with Dota 2 while Talos Principle should see similar boosts. Great to see that code going mainline and will have some fresh Intel Vulkan benchmarks shortly. Then within the RADV driver today is enabling conditional discard optimizations while prior to that it was adding the optimization for NIR. Enabling this is said to fix "a bunch of GPU hangs" brought around by some conformance test cases for Vulkan. This optimization is a candidate for backporting to Mesa 13.0 given it fixes hangs/bugs. Fresh open-source Vulkan Linux benchmarks coming up soon on Phoronix. 5 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 9, 2016 at 2:17PM In late October, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) unveiled its next-generation MacBook Pro laptops. One interesting feature of these systems is that the company replaced the legacy USB ports with Thunderbolt 3 ports (two on the entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro; four on the higher-end 13-inch model with Touch Bar as well as on the 15-inch model). Apple's new MacBook Pro computers use Thunderbolt 3 for connectivity. Image source: Apple.  Per a teardown report from iFixit, the Thunderbolt 3 capability inside of the entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro is provided by an Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) JHL6540 Thunderbolt 3 controller. It is likely that the MacBook Pro models sporting four Thunderbolt 3 ports will include two of these controllers, as Intel's specification page for the JHL6540 part says that it only supports two Thunderbolt 3 ports.  In addition to supplying Thunderbolt controllers into Apple's new MacBook Pro systems, Intel also provides the main processors for all current Mac systems.  During Intel's 2015 investor meeting, former Intel PC chief Kirk Skaugen said that the company plans to integrate Thunderbolt into its processors over the "next several years." Let's take a closer look at when we should expect it and what it will mean for Intel and PC makers such as Apple. The implications for Intel Skaugen's comment about Thunderbolt integration came as part of a broader discussion on the reasons that Intel generally integrates functionality previously handled in stand-alone chips into its processors. "We have a history of intelligent integration," Skaugen began. "If you look at audio, Iris graphics, touch controllers, image processing units, sensor hubs, and security, all of these when we integrate we add a little bit to our average selling price, we give a little back to our OEM, and we give a little bit back to the end user." This commentary suggests that when Thunderbolt capability is integrated directly into Intel's future processors, Intel will be able to charge customers more for those processors -- a clear win for Intel. Intel's specification page shows list prices for its Thunderbolt controllers ranging from $6.45 to $8.55. If Thunderbolt integration allows Intel to raise its Core processor average selling prices by just $2 to $3, then Intel could be looking at hundreds of millions of incremental annual revenues. That's not chump change. The implications for personal computer makers Skaugen's comments imply that the cost of a processor with integrated Thunderbolt to a system vendor will be lower than what the cost of an Intel processor coupled with stand-alone Thunderbolt 3 controllers would be. The impact to a company like Apple, which has already gone all-in on Thunderbolt/USB Type C, will likely just be that their systems become a little bit cheaper to build. The savings won't be huge, but most for-profit entities tend to like opportunities to shave off unnecessary costs.  The other system vendors that haven't yet adopted the technology may be compelled to do so once it comes standard with every Intel processor.  Thunderbolt is a marketable technology that offers a significant performance boost over prior-generation USB technology; if some system vendors adopt it, the system vendors that don't could be putting themselves at senseless disadvantages in the marketplace.  Thunderbolt 3 is apparently much faster than prior technologies. Image source: Intel.  Furthermore, if the technology will be integrated into future Intel processors anyway, and if the system vendors are going to pay for those processors whether or not they use Thunderbolt, then why not just implement it?  With a proliferation of systems with Thunderbolt support, it is likely that computer peripheral makers will more aggressively design their products to provide native support for and take full advantage of the standard.

Page 1 of 6. 24 Comments Kaby Lake mobile processors began shipping last month and while we've seen a number of laptop designs using these processors that succeed Skylake, so far the Intel NUCs haven't surfaced nor many other SFF PCs making use of the next-generation hardware. That changed last week with MSI's Cubi 2 powered by Kaby Lake CPUs beginning to ship. I've been testing an MSI Cubi 2 with Core i5 Kaby Lake processor under Ubuntu Linux and so far the experience has been pleasant. In this article are our first Kaby Lake Linux benchmarks. On 4 November is when the MSI Cubi 2 with Kaby Lake CPUs began shipping at both Amazon.com and NewEgg. With being very curious about Intel Kaby Lake on Linux and the Cubi 2 being the cheapest way to get ahold of a KBL CPU for right now, I ended up buying the Core i5 7200U model for benchmarking on Phoronix. The Cubi 2 is around the same size as an Intel NUC and their Cubi2-006BUS model with Core i5 7200U retails for $380 USD while you still need to add in the DDR4 SO-DIMMs and SATA/M.2 storage. Kaby Lake came around when Intel delayed the 10nm Cannonlake to H2'2017. Kaby Lake CPUs are manufactured on a 14nm process while offering higher clock speeds over similar Skylake models, native USB 3.1 Gen2 support is now present, support for Intel Optane technology, and improved 3D graphics / video are more pressing for Kaby Lake than any major CPU breakthroughs with this microarchitecture update. The Core i5 7200U mobile processor found in this Cubi 2 being benchmarked is a dual-core part plus has Hyper Threading, the base frequency is 2.50GHz, and the turbo frequency is 3.1GHz. The TDP of the i5-7200U is 15 Watts and this processor has a 3MB smart cache. The graphics on the Core i5 7200U are the HD Graphics 620 with a 300MHz base frequency and 1GHz maximum frequency. This was my first time trying out a Cubi 2 -- or any MSI pre-built PC since the Wind Box Atom 330 days. The Cubi 2 concept is similar to the Intel NUC and is very easy to open up the device from the bottom and install the DDR4-2133 SO-DIMMs (up to 32GB) and 2.5-inch SATA SSD or mSATA SSD. The Cubi 2 does support a VESA-mount with included bracket, similar to the NUCs. For wireless connectivity the device has an Intel 3168 M.2 WiFi adapter for 802.11ac WiFi support and Bluetooth 4.2. Video connectivity for the HD Graphics 620 are HDMI and a mini DisplayPort. 4K display was working fine for me with this device. This device also has a USB Gen 1 Type-C reversible connector. If you are looking for something slower or faster, MSI's other Kaby Lake Cubi 2 models have a Core i7 7500U or Core i3 7100U while the other specifications remain the same.

Another Old Intel Motherboard Gets Picked Up By Coreboot Written by Michael Larabel in Coreboot on 9 November 2016 at 07:22 AM EST. 15 Comments If you still are running Intel i945 era hardware, you may be happy to know another motherboard from this time is now supported by mainline Coreboot. The newest motherboard supported by Coreboot is the Gigabyte GA-945GCM-S2L. This micro-ATX i945 motherboard from the Core 2 Extreme / Core 2 Duo days has DDR2-667 support, Intel GMA 950 graphics, SATA 2.0, Gigabit LAN, and Intel HD Audio. Support for this old motherboard landed in Coreboot Git last night. PCI/PCIe slots are working along with serial output but not working currently with this less than thousand lines of new Coreboot code is resuming from suspend. More details via that Git commit message. The Gigabyte GA-945GCM-S2L is obviously still no longer produced but if you are wanting a cheap motherboard to play with Coreboot, this board can be found on eBay and second-hand web-sites for $30~35 USD. 15 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Windows 10 Mobile review: A new hope? Blass says the two companies started working on the project, known internally as Dell Stack, in mid-2014 and it focuses on a 6.4-inch mini-tablet that would be used to power desktop, laptop and tablet computing experiences. The aim of the alleged project would be to combine all your devices into one, to save you moving data from one device to the next, or having to upload it to the cloud to then download to another device. Everything would always be on the one Stack tablet which would be moved from screen to screen. The Dell Stack would make full use of Windows 10's Continuum feature, which lets a device running Windows 10 Mobile connect to a screen and deliver a simplified version of Windows 10. Windows 10 Mobile devices can't support a full version of Windows 10 because of hardware limitations, but they can support Universal Windows Platform apps (UWP). What makes the Stack different though is that it would be able to deliver a full Windows 10 desktop experience when docked because it would use an x86 CPU from Intel's Kaby Lake Y-series of processors. It would come in different memory and storage configurations, having either 4GB or 8GB RAM and 128GB or 256GB solid state storage as well as a microSD slot for expansion. And everything would be housed in a body no thicker than 9mm. Microsoft Windows 10 Creators Update: What's new? The Venture Beat report also mentions a second generation that would have a 6-inch screen and full phone and messaging functions, essentially a Windows 10 smartphone. Nobody knows whether the project will come to fruition though. The first products were due to be launched in Spring 2017, but there's still been no official announcement from Dell. It could be that Stack is a concept vision of Dell's, but the actual products released, if any will be a more diluted vision taking inspiration from these plans. Images leaked a couple of days ago alleging to be a Windows Surface phone. It could now be that it's the Dell Stack. We're keen to follow for any updates because if Stack does happen, it could be a seriously powerful computing experience.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Samsung announces fourth-gen 14nm node, plans 10nm improvements, and shows off 7nm EUV wafer Samsung announces fourth-gen 14nm node, plans 10nm improvements, and shows off 7nm EUV wafer By Joel Hruska on November 4, 2016 at 8:51 am Comment Samsung announced several updates to its process technology roadmap today at its Samsung Foundry Forum. Like Intel, Samsung intends to offer multiple generations of a single process node — but unlike Intel, it isn’t debuting a new strategy in lieu of maintaining a quick transition roadmap. First, there’s interesting news concerning a fourth-generation 14nm product, 14LPU. For those keeping score at home, Samsung released 14nm Low Power Early (14LPE) first, followed by 14nm Low Power Plus (14LPP), which was broader ramp with more customers and up to 10% improved performance. Earlier this year, the company announced it would build a lower-cost variant of 14nm that didn’t sacrifice on power or performance, 14LPC. This fourth-generation 14LPU is meant explicitly for customers who are building “high performance, compute-intensive” applications. 14LPU is said to offer better performance than 14LPC, but Samsung hasn’t published details on how all four of its processes compare with one another; only 14LPP and 14LPE are listed on its website. It’s not hard to read between these particular lines, however. When foundries add new iterations of existing process nodes, it’s typically because they’ve got customers who are interested in those process nodes and want to take advantage of them. Adding a higher power line could mean that Samsung wants to compete for more business from AMD, Nvidia, or even Qualcomm’s server processor — or it could be that Samsung meant relatively high-performance parts, and that it’s still focusing on lower power hardware at relatively low TDPs. Either way, Samsung clearly believes that 14nm will stick around as a long-lived node, and is worth investing in. Samsung’s new 14nm LPU and 10nm LPU aren’t shown here, but this was cutting-edge information as of October 2016 The company is still pushing ahead with its plans to roll out 10nm technology, however, and has also announced a new 10nm node, 10LPU. The company describes this as follows: Due to limitations of current lithography technologies, 10LPU is expected to be the most cost-effective cutting-edge process technology in the industry. Together with the second-generation 10nm process (10LPP) that offers an extra performance boost from 10LPE, 10LPU is positioned to meet the needs of an extended range of applications that can benefit from the advanced 10nm process. Samsung seems to be implying that 14LPU is a higher performance node, while 10LPU is a cost-optimized node. Meanwhile, the company also showed off a 7nm EUV wafer and provided an “update” on its 7nm EUV progress, but neglected to tell us anything about what that update was. This is one area where there’s notable difference between the various foundries — Intel says it intends to push to 7nm without EUV, but will deploy that tech at 5nm. TSMC has said something similar, but Samsung remains resolute that it can introduce EUV at the 7nm node. The question of who will use that capacity is less clear. The number of companies deploying cutting-edge process nodes has dwindled as design costs have exploded, and there’s money to be made in improving yields and performance at older process nodes, if anyone can figure out how to do it. It’ll be interesting to see how the TSMC / Samsung / GlobalFoundries match-up shifts over the next 12 to 18 months. Samsung beat TSMC to the 14/16nm node and reaped substantial financial benefits from doing so, while GF had to license Samsung tech rather than continue developing its own 14XM. Now, GlobalFoundries says it’ll bring its own 7nm to market, while TSMC is gunning hard for 10nm. With fewer companies designing on cutting-edge nodes, it means there’s less room for error than ever.

At the property of tech giant Intel, a few of them cross to the east side of the creek on a wooden bridge called “The Freedom Bridge.” They might not have that option much longer. Despite its name, the Freedom Bridge is ensnared in a bureaucratic tussle involving Intel, the Santa Clara Valley Water District and the city of Santa Clara. And if it disappears, a cadre of bicyclists and pedestrians will be inconvenienced. Here’s the story as I can gather it: The Freedom Bridge was built by Intel less than two decades ago, when the company owned property on both sides of the creek. It was initially meant to be temporary, a bridge for construction crews. Then it became a popular route to work. Santa Clara officials say Intel recently sold the property on the west side of the creek to Greystar, an apartment developer. That change of ownership has renewed doubts about the bridge from the water district, which says the crossing fails to meet its standards for trail connections and access ramps for walkers and the disabled. Meanwhile, the bicyclists have been waging a last-ditch — pun intended — campaign to save the bridge, which could be demolished as early as Sept. 16, after Intel’s permit for the crossing expires. If the bridge comes down, bicyclists and pedestrians would have to circle north via a very busy Mission College Boulevard. Safety issue “We believe that spending money to demolish the bridge would make bicycle commuting harder,” says Robert W. Herrick, a regular bicycle commuter who has led the effort to save the bridge. “It would create a safety problem that would result in dozens of injuries per year.” There may be an answer here through the good graces of the city of Santa Clara: Councilwoman Teresa O’Neill, the chairwoman of the City Council’s bicycle and pedestrian committee, has suggested extending Intel’s permit for the bridge for at least another six months to find a solution. “We need to have time to see what it would take to bring it up to standards,” says O’Neill, who says — rightly — that demolition would be a step backward for the city’s emphasis on alternatives to cars. There’s also the thorny question of liability. O’Neill told me that neither the water district nor Intel wants to take on the liability if someone is injured on the bridge. Put another way, nobody wants to deal with the lawyers. Maintenance The public record suggests that the water district, which I dubbed “The Golden Spigot” for its free-spending ways, doesn’t really like the bridge. In a letter to a constituent, board Chairwoman Barbara Keegan said bridges “pose an ongoing maintenance issue for us.” When I talked to her, Keegan left the door open to saving the bridge. “Certainly, the district would be happy to consider an extension to the permit to see if there are things that could be done to make this a long-term facility,” she told me. “That would mean meeting current standards in terms of pedestrian and bicycle bridges. And it would have to provide full access to city streets.” A spokesperson for Intel said only that the company continues to talk with the water district. But I’ve talked to several Intel employees who say the company is willing to do some work — but believes that several water district demands, such as widening access ways or making the bridge an explicit public access point, infringe on its property. So we’re left with a standoff — very Californian in this new century. I happen to think there’s a way to solve this one. It begins with time. The Freedom Bridge — wooden, utilitarian, very unfancy — deserves a six-month or yearlong reprieve. We’ll figure it out from there.

I really doubt the kabylake-X chip will be much faster than the regular desktop part. they have probably just allowed ECC on the memory, and some other Enterprise features not found on the Desktop version. that could account for the slight increase in TDP.

Then you'll want one of our best ultrabooks under $500. If you’re in the market for a new laptop and need a productivity powerhouse on a budget, you might be asking yourself: what’s the best ultrabook under $500 in 2016? With the release of Intel’s latest 7th-generation Core processors, the answer to that question is growing into a longer list by the day. For this list, we wanted to keep our eyes set on ultrabooks that offer a great value for the money, with at least 4GB of RAM, a 500GB hard drive, and the aforementioned 7th-gen processors. All those factors considered, we’ve come to the conclusion that the #1 pick is the new Aspire E 15 series. The Aspire line has always been an incredible series of laptops, but the E 15 takes it to the next level thanks to its low price point, 1920 x 1080 screen, and internal upgrade to DDR4 RAM. That all said, you might want to check our best value ultrabook list, which comes in at a higher price point but adds bang for buck. Best Ultrabook Under $500 2016   Acer Aspire E 15 Dell Inspiron 11 3179 HP 15-ay011nr Rank #1 - Editor's Choice/ Best 2-in-1 Ultrabook #2 Pick #3 Pick Amazon Rating Screen Size 15.6" 13.3" 15.6" Display 1920 x 1080 1366 x 768 1920 x 1080 Battery Life Up to 12hrs Up to 10hrs Up to 8hrs Touchscreen CPU 2.4GHz Intel Core i3-7100U 2.6GHz Intel Core m3-7y30 2.3GHz Intel Core i5-6200U RAM 4GB DDR4 4GB DDR3L 8 GB DDR3L Storage 1TB HDD 500GB HDD 1TB HDD Weight 5.27 pounds 3.24 pounds 4.73 pounds Price $349.99 $449.99 $459.99 Buy Now Buy Now Buy Now How We Choose the Ultrabook Under $500 When we talk about the ultrabook category, the term “value” isn’t usually the first thing that pops up into people’s heads. But, thanks to Moore’s Law, now it’s possible to get many of the features you’d expect on a $1,500 laptop from two years ago on a sub-$500 device today. These include boot times from sleep that are under the one second mark, a minimum of 4GB of DDR3 (or DDR3L) RAM, an Intel Core i-X processor, and 500GB of onboard storage. Read More: What Is an Ultrabook? As Intel rolls out its brand spanking new 7th generation of its Core i processors, we kept a keen out for any laptops which included this feature since the fresh CPUs promise to be faster and more power efficient than anything else that came before. Lastly, it’s important to note that none of the choices on this list are specifically designated as “ultrabooks” by Intel, but that’s only because they’re missing one or two features each that hold them back from the proper distinction. Regular ultrabooks start no lower than $899, but the laptops here still match 90% of the criteria while costing significantly less overall. They may not be as slim or quick to boot as a designated ultrabook, they’re the closest (and fastest) you’re going to get in the under $500 range. Why You Should Buy an Ultrabook Under $500 Just because you want to own an ultrabook doesn’t always mean you have to pay an “ultra” high price for the privilege. Though ultrabooks spent years as one of the most expensive options available in the laptop market, as technology has gotten faster and cheaper, so have the prices of these once unattainable laptops fallen down to a point where they’re affordable for most consumers. If you haven’t looked for an ultrabook simply on the basis that owning one might be too expensive, it’s time to take a second look at what’s out there in 2016. #1 Pick  Acer Aspire E 15/Editor’s Choice With a super sleek design and an 7th-gen CPU, it’s not hard to see why the Acer Aspire E tops our list Price: $349.99 | Features: 2.4GHz Intel Core i3-7100U CPU, 12-hr battery life WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: Cutting edge features at a price that everyone can afford.  For everything the Acer Aspire E 15 lacks (any kind of SSD, to name one thing), it makes up for immediately with a bargain-basement price and the inclusion of an all new 7th-gen processor from Intel. Sporting a 2.4GHz Intel Core i3-7100U CPU, you can be sure that the Acer Aspire E 15 will last longer and run faster than any other laptop in this cost tier, not an easy feat considering what the rest of the competition is capable of. Tie that upgrade in with the choice to pump the 4GB of RAM up from DDR3L to DDR4 on the current model, and you’ve got a recipe for success for the best ultrabook under $500. View on Amazon #2 Pick Dell Inspiron 11 3179 2-in-1 If you need a cheaper 2-in-1 with decent specs, the Dell Inspiron checks off every box on your list Price: $449.99  | Features: 2-in-1 hinge, 11.6″ touchscreen, 4GB DDR4 RAM WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: The Dell is a solid 2-in-1 under $500 with a touchscreen for work or play.  Like the Aspire, the Inspiron line of laptops from Dell have been a flagship seller for the brand, leading the way when it comes to power and price on nearly every front imaginable. The latest off that roster is the Dell Inspiron 11 3179 (Inspiron i3179 for short), a 2-in-1 ultrabook that comes with a fully responsive touchscreen that’s great for taking notes or playing games on the go. Read More: Best 2-in-1 Ultrabooks This ultrabook comes equipped with an Intel Core m3-7y30 as opposed to a Core i CPU, so while it may not necessarily be as fast as the Aspire off the line, it’s got more than enough power efficiency to last for the long haul. If your main concern is with the screen then you might want to skip the Inspiron (it only rocks a less-than-HD 1366 x 768 resolution), but other than that small caveat it’s still got all the specs we crave at a price that won’t leave you scraping out your pockets by the time you leave the checkout line. View on Amazon #3 Pick  HP 15-ay011nr 15.6″ Despite its wacky name scheme, there’s nothing silly about these specs Price: $459.99  | Features: 15.6″ 1920 x 1080 display, 8GB DDR3L SDRAM, 2.3GHz Core i5-6200U CPU WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: For all out power, the HP 15-ay011nr can’t be beat.  Awkward naming schemes aside, the HP 15-ay011nr is a solid, respectable ultrabook under $500 that will get the job done that you need it to when you’re in a pinch. Although it may not sport the bleeding edge of processors, it offsets its 6th generation roots with increased power by bumping things up to an i5 CPU, unlike the i3 and m3 found in the Acer and Dell. Read More: Best Ultrabook Under $1,000 This laptop is a little heavier than we might like, but it combines all the features an ultrabook needs with media features and a beefier GPU in case you want to take a little time off work to play games instead. For an all-around choice that will be just as proficient in the office as it will at home, it’s hard to find an ultrabook under $500 that offers a better slew of available add-ons. View on Amazon Most Important Features Weight Ultrabooks are made to be portable, because you never know when a work emergency might pop up and you’ll need to be online within seconds. All the laptops here are less than 5lbs, though the HP is the heaviest of the bunch. If you want something light and lean, go with the Acer E series. The new processor helps to save on weight that would otherwise be packed into the battery, thanks to its increased ability to use that power on a more efficient basis. Battery life Ultrabooks are known for their long battery life, and if you need a laptop that will last through long periods without being plugged in, you’ve come to the right place. All the laptops listed here have a minimum battery life of at least 8 hours, a stat that Intel themselves mandate if a laptop wants the honor of being able to call itself an ultrabook at all. Display Two of the three ultrabooks listed here have full HD, 1920 x 1080 screens that would look good at work or for watching a few episodes of Game of Thrones after you get back from the office. One is a touchscreen, though, which means the cost of a capacitive screen goes up. That’s why the Dell still rocks the 1366 x 768 lower resolution display, so if that’s your main concern, you’re better off going with the Acer or the HP instead. Price Of course, this wouldn’t be a list of the best ultrabooks under $500 if we didn’t talk about the price, right? On average, getting any kind of laptop under $500 means you’re going to have to make a few sacrifices along the way. Namely, this will happen with the GPU. Don’t expect to be playing any heavy duty games on these laptops, but as long as you’re okay with giving those up, everything else should measure up just fine. Mistakes or Things to Avoid Avoid DDR3: All the laptops we’ve included on this list use at least DDR3L or DDR4 RAM, both options that use drastically less power than their older counterpart, DDR3. DDR3 is quickly being phased out of all models past the 2016 mark, so if you can afford to upgrade, this is the first place you’re going to want to do it. Don’t Compromise: Although we’ve listed our personal top 3 picks here, there are plenty of options out there to choose from when it comes to ultrabooks. If you want a better screen but don’t care about having a large hard drive because you store all your files in the cloud, then get a better screen with a flash drive instead! With ultrabooks the possibilities are nearly endless, so never compromise just because you think you have to when you’re sticking to a smaller budget. What Else You Should Think About Now that you’ve got your pick for the best ultrabook under $500, what other considerations should you make about your new laptop and all the cool things you plan to do with it? First of all, you should definitely check out our post on Ultrabooks vs Chromebooks to get the lowdown on what makes your ultrabook better than the Chromed out competition. Next, if you want the absolute lightest Ultrabook possible and have a little bit more than $500 to spend, we also have a great resource on the Lightest Ultrabooks in 2016 for you to peruse. Ultimately it’s obvious that the Acer Aspire E is a solid value with great features that run at the cutting edge of what ultrabooks are capable of these days, but remember there’s always plenty of options out there no matter what you need your laptop to do!

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Cooler Master's MasterLiquid Maker 92 CPU cooler reviewed Liquid cooling in a tower-cooler footprint by Jeff Kampman  6:48 PM on November 10, 2016 For builders looking to cool a hot-clocked CPU like Intel's Core i7-6700K, tower-style coolers and closed-loop liquid coolers come with tradeoffs. Go with the tower-style air cooler, and you might need a 170-mm tall monster with multiple 140-mm fans to keep your system cool and quiet. Choose a liquid cooler, and you have to find a place for a huge radiator stack to exhaust its waste heat or hope that your case's airflow is otherwise good enough to move that hot air out. Liquid coolers often leave CPU voltage-regulation circuitry at the mercy of fans around the CPU socket, too, and their pump noise can be an annoyance to those with sensitive ears. Those tradeoffs are hard enough to make in a roomy ATX mid-tower, but builders of high-end systems in compact microATX or Mini-ITX cases might have an especially hard time finding a powerful enough cooler to make their dreams a reality. Often, it's not even possible to fit a big enough air cooler for high-performance builds inside cases like the Corsair Carbide Series Air 240 or the Graphite Series 380T—it's liquid or nothing. Cooler Master is trying to help those small-form-factor builders out by bringing the best of air and liquid coolers together in one heatsink: the MasterLiquid Maker 92. The concept behind this $100 cooler is so unusual that it doesn't really have its own category yet, so let me explain. The Maker 92 sandwiches a self-contained pump and radiator between a pair of push-pull 95-mm fans. That cooling stack rests atop a bracket that allows the sandwich to rest in a vertical position, like a tower cooler, or in a horizontal one, like a blow-down air cooler. Where the base and heatpipes of a traditional tower-style cooler might go, Cooler Master snaked a pair of coolant hoses down to a low-profile water block with a hefty copper cold plate. This entire self-contained apparatus sits right on top of the CPU socket, just like a tower-style cooler would. It's compact, as well. In its horizontal position, the Maker 92 is just 4.7" (118.8 mm) tall, and its relatively compact footprint shouldn't cause clearance issues with tall memory heatsinks or motherboards with a PCIe x16 slot close to the CPU socket. Flip the cooling stack upright, and the Maker 92 measures in at 6.6" tall (167.5 mm), about the same as the iconic Hyper 212 Evo or the MasterAir Pro 4 we just reviewed. Cooler Master's unique design requires some tradeoffs of its own. The MasterAir Maker 92 only works with Intel LGA 115x and LGA 2011 sockets—builders with AMD CPUs are left entirely out in the cold. On the off chance you still own an Intel LGA 775 or LGA 1366 motherboard, you also won't find mounting hardware in the Maker 92's box. If you've been building from our recent System Guides, those constraints shouldn't be cause for concern, but they do mean the Maker 92's appeal may not be as wide as it could have been. Builders likely won't be able to swap out the Maker 92's fans, either—their unique 95-mm dimensions aside, these fans are designed specifically to let the Maker 92 do its swivelly thing. If I had to pick a pair of fans to be stuck with, however, the Maker 92's could share far worse lineage than Cooler Master's own Silencio 120 FPs. These fans use five broadly-swept blades in a design that's optimized for static pressure—important for moving air through densely-packed radiator fins. The MasterLiquid Maker 92 draws power from a combination SATA-and-PWM cable that can be gently split in two for more routing freedom. That's handy, since most builders probably won't want to route a dedicated chain of SATA power connectors into the main chambers of their cases just to power the Maker 92. One interesting thing about the Maker 92 is that its fans can shut off entirely when the CPU underneath is at idle. By default, the internal circuitry of the Maker 92 cuts off the fans when the PWM duty cycle from the motherboard falls below 50%. That means the only sound from the cooler at idle will be its pump—a potentially appealing characteristic in noise-sensitive environments. Folks who would prefer airflow at idle will need to set the PWM duty cycle on their CPU fan headers to a level above 50%.

Today, the company has confirmed the final specifications of its upcoming device, the Eve V. According to the company, Eve V will come with Intel’s 7th Gen Core M3/i5/i7 processors. The device will also come with up to 16GB of LPDDR3 RAM, up to 512GB of storage, a 12.3-inch IGZO LCD display, a fingerprint scanner, quad speakers, and a wireless keyboard. The device will also support a Thunderbolt 3 port, two USB Type-C ports, and a 48Wh battery. Eve has also compared the device with Microsoft’s Surface Pro 4 which is where the Eve V shines quite a lot. The Eve V beats the Surface Pro 4 in most cases, which isn’t really surprising to see as the Surface Pro 4 is more than a year old. As you can see in the comparison above, the Eve V has better processors than the Surface Pro 4 as it’s coming with Intel’s latest Kaby Lake processors. Additionally, the device also has better ports and connectivity than the Surface Pro 4. As for the battery, the Eve V is also ahead of the Surface Pro 4 — but it’ll be interesting to see if the device’s battery life is actually any better than the Surface Pro 4. Microsoft Surface Pro 4, on the other hand, does beat the Eve V when it comes to the cameras as it boasts a 5MP camera on the front and an 8MP camera on the back — however, the Eve V only includes a 2MP camera on the front and a 5MP camera on the back. The Eve V should be available via an Indiegogo campaign sometime soon, but the device’s price is still unknown. Some links in the article may not be viewable as you are using an AdBlocker.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Nov 10, 2016 at 1:07PM With the market hovering near all-time highs, it might seem tough to find stocks with significant upside potential from current levels. But for investors willing to take a risk on more beaten-down or volatile plays, these three picks might double within the next few years -- Twilio (NYSE:TWLO), CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR), and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD). Image source: Getty Images. Twilio Twilio's cloud platform links popular apps like Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Uber, and Airbnb to users' phone numbers. Its service lets users add contacts, send text messages, or call each other via their phone numbers within an app. That feature is tough for a developer to create and scale up on its own, so it's generally more convenient, economical, and reliable to subscribe to Twilio's platform. Growing demand for Twilio's services boosted its revenue by 62% annually to $71.5 million last quarter, and its active customer accounts grew 45%. Twilio expects its revenue to rise 61%-62% for the full year, compared to 88% growth in 2015. Twilio still isn't profitable, but its non-GAAP net losses narrowed last quarter. Twilio's core business looks promising, but it's been on a roller-coaster ride since its IPO in late June. It initially surged from its IPO price of $15 to nearly $70 by late September, inflating its price-to-sales ratio into the high 20s. Twilio then announced a secondary offering in early October, triggering a massive sell-off that knocked the stock back to the low $30s. But now that Twilio's P/S ratio has cooled off to 12, and short interest has surged to 50% as of Oct. 25, I believe that the stock is poised for a rebound. CyberArk Cybersecurity company CyberArk is the market leader in the PAM (privileged account management) market. Its platform protects companies from internal threats, like disgruntled employees, by locking down compromised computers before they impact the rest of the network. Image source: Getty Images. CyberArk doesn't face much competition in this market because most cybersecurity companies focus on external threats with next-gen firewalls and threat detection systems. Yet a report from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Security last September found that 43% of data breaches were actually caused internally. As a result, rising demand for CyberArk's services boosted its revenue 37% annually to $55 million last quarter. CyberArk expects its revenue to rise 33%-34% for the full year, compared to 56% growth in 2015. Unlike many other cybersecurity firms, CyberArk is profitable on a GAAP basis. Its GAAP net income rose 4% to $7.1 million last quarter, while its non-GAAP net income improved 28% to $11.8 million. Despite those strong numbers, CyberArk stock has stayed almost flat over the past 12 months due to concerns about its slowing sales growth, weak enterprise spending, and its high valuations (8.5 times sales and 62 times earnings). However, the rising number of data breaches worldwide could continue boosting CyberArk's top and bottom line growth for years to come. With an enterprise value of just $1.2 billion, CyberArk could also be a lucrative takeover target for larger cybersecurity, networking, or IT companies. AMD It might seem greedy to believe that chipmaker AMD, which already rallied 200% over the past 12 months, could still double from its current price. However, the stock remains fairly cheap with a P/S ratio of 1.4, which is much lower than Intel's ratio of 2.7 and Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) ratio of 6.7. AMD stock has been rising on the growth of its EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) business, which is mainly supported by its sales of custom SoCs for the PS4 and Xbox One. New versions of these consoles -- like the PS4 Pro, PS4 Slim, Xbox One S, and Xbox Scorpio -- will require even more AMD chips. AMD has also been pushing hard against Nvidia in the "VR ready" GPU market with low-cost GPUs like the RX 480. Looking ahead, AMD's next-gen Vega GPUs and Zen CPUs could help it narrow its performance gaps with Nvidia's high-end GPUs and Intel's high-end CPUs. Back in July, AMD posted 9% annual sales growth for its second quarter, marking its first year-over-year sales growth in two years. It followed that up with 23% sales growth in the third quarter, and is on track to grow its annual sales by 6% for 2016 -- compared to a 28% decline in 2015. AMD remains unprofitable on a GAAP basis, but it squeezed out a non-GAAP profit of $27 million last quarter. If that bottom line improvement continues, AMD's price might head back to the double-digits within the next few years. But don't get greedy... Twilio, CyberArk, and AMD all have upside potential, but they are also fairly risky plays which shouldn't be considered core investments. I personally own both Twilio and CyberArk, but only as minor positions designated as "higher risk, higher reward" plays. These stocks could certainly double over the long term, but I also wouldn't be surprised if they were cut in half during a market downturn.   Leo Sun owns shares of CyberArk Software and Twilio Inc.

Resend activation e-mail Gear & Gadgets / Product News & Reviews Surface Book with Performance Base: A lot more graphics in a little more weight Review: Faster GPU, longer-lasting battery; full Kaby Lake refresh would've been better. by Peter Bright - Nov 10, 2016 2:00 pm UTC Login to bookmark 61 Peter Bright Most of the PC OEMs have refreshed their Skylake systems to include Intel's new Kaby Lake chips. Kaby Lake parts are for the most part drop-in replacements for Skylake parts—same chipsets, same power envelopes and cooling requirements—and some manufacturers have taken advantage of this fact. Dell's new XPS 13 is in most regards identical to the old XPS 13, for example, except for the processor swap. Some manufacturers have been a little more ambitious; HP's updated Spectre x360 adds Thunderbolt 3 and Windows Hello support as well as slashing the size and weight. Microsoft, however, has gone for none of these routes. The Surface Pro 4 with its Skylake processor remains the current iteration of the company's productivity-oriented tablet and hasn't changed since its introduction. The Surface Book, the laptop that can do double duty as a tablet, also remains a Skylake system. But Microsoft has made an upgrade of sorts to the Surface Book range in the form of an even more expensive version that sits at the very top of the range: the Surface Book with Performance Base. Specs at a glance: Microsoft Surface Book with Performance Base Base Best As reviewed Screen 3000×2000 13.5" (267 PPI), 10-point capacitive PixelSense touchscreen OS Windows 10 Pro CPU Intel 6th generation Core i7 RAM 8GB 16GB 16GB GPU Intel HD Graphics 520 + Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M 2GB SSD 256GB 1TB 1TB Networking 802.11ac/a/b/g/n with 2x2 MIMO antennas, Bluetooth 4.0 Ports Mini-DisplayPort, headphones, SD, 2 USB 3.0 Cameras Rear: 8MP autofocus, 1080p video Front: 5MP, 1080p video, infrared facial recognition Size 12.30×9.14×0.59-0.90" (312×232×14.9-23 mm) Weight 3.68 lb (1.647 kg) Battery 18 Wh (tablet) + 62 Wh (base) Warranty 1 year Price $2,399 $3,299 $3,299 Sensors Ambient light sensor, accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer Charger 65W Other features Surface Pen, TPM 2.0 The Surface Book's big party trick is that the screen portion is the part that contains the computer; it has batteries, a processor, RAM, storage, and everything else. The keyboard base, the part that in a regular laptop houses the computer parts, contains only the keyboard, touchpad, and battery. On higher-end models the keyboard base also contains a discrete Nvidia GPU. This GPU is non-standard; it doesn't neatly line up with any of Nvidia's usual mobile parts, and while it's faster than the Intel integrated graphics, it's not as quick as the more mainstream numbered parts. As might be guessed from the name, the Surface Book with Performance Base doesn't touch the tablet part of the system at all, and the original Surface Book review still holds true for basically every aspect of the system. It's the same old Skylake machine as it was since it was launched last year. The only part that changes is the keyboard base. On the outside, it's chunkier: it's a little bit thicker (by 0.08 inches/1.9mm) and a little bit heavier (by 0.34lbs/0.13kg), and the top surface bulges upwards. So much so that the keyboard, which stands proud on the normal base, is now recessed, though both keyboard and touchpad feel otherwise identical to the ones on the regular base. Enlarge / The base now bulges above the keyboard, leaving it slightly inset. Peter Bright That bulging thickness has been used to do two things. First, the battery is bigger: 61.2 Wh, compared to 52 Wh in the regular base for a total (between the tablet and the base) of 80 Wh, up from 70 Wh. Second, the GPU is upgraded: it's now a standard model, specifically, the GeForce GTX 965M. This better GPU and bigger battery cost an extra $100 over the corresponding skinny discrete GPU version. The Intel graphics inexplicably crash in this test. The consequences of this are obvious enough. For compute workloads and when using the integrated graphics, the Performance Base performs identically because nothing has changed. Graphical workloads, however, are substantially quicker: depending on the benchmark, we're seeing between 30- and 100-percent increases in performance in the switch to the 965M. It's definitely a faster chip, and if you want to use a Surface Book for gaming or other 3D intensive workloads, it's a clear improvement. Microsoft has had to upgrade the cooling system in the Performance Base to cope with the 965M's greater power draw. During heavy workloads, the fan noise is definitely noticeable, though it seemed to cope adequately without throttling. The longevity is nice too. The total battery capacity is about 14 percent bigger, and lo and behold, the runtime on battery is about 14 percent higher. It's a simple trade-off; the bigger battery weighs more and is thicker, but it lasts longer. If that's important to you, it's worth having. Why isn't this a bigger upgrade? The Performance Base does the job it's supposed to do; if you need more graphical performance or battery life from your Surface Book, it's clearly the option to go for, especially with a mere $100 price delta. But it nonetheless raises a number of questions. The obvious one is, why hasn't Microsoft switched to Kaby Lake? A switch to Kaby Lake would likely provide a modest improvement in battery life, a modest increase in CPU performance, and a somewhat larger increase in integrated GPU performance. Even with the discrete GPU this is valuable, because many workloads (such as browsers) stick with the integrated graphics. Our understanding is that the Surface Book's tablet portion is up against the limits of Intel's thermal and power specifications, so much so that Kaby Lake wouldn't be a straightforward drop-in replacement. As such, making the upgrade may have required full revalidation and possibly a redesign of the cooling systems, which wasn't worth it for such a small update. Problem is, the tablet (and the Surface Pro 4) would benefit from a refresh. Aside from their processors, the lack of USB Type-C or Thunderbolt 3 on these systems, while tolerable at their 2015 introduction, looks rather more intolerable as we head into 2017. These are still premium-priced systems, and they should offer premium features. Kaby Lake provides the impetus for just such a refresh. Similarly, the choice of the older generation 965M, rather than the new 10x0 series, may have some people wondering why Microsoft hasn't gone for Nvidia's latest and greatest; I'd imagine that the project timeframes just didn't match up well. Nvidia's new chipsets are also more power hungry than the older ones, and with the dimensions of the Performance Base constrained by the need to remain compatible with the Surface Book, squeezing it all in might not have been possible. Enlarge / Top: regular Surface Book; Bottom: Surface Book with Performance Base. Peter Bright The other annoying issue is that existing owners of Surface Books have no upgrade path. Microsoft isn't selling the Performance Base separately, so if you want one, you'll have to buy a whole new system. The performance gap is big enough that Surface Book owners running graphically intensive workloads would probably see significant gains from making the switch, but having to spend a minimum of $2,399 to get one is painful. There's nothing preventing swapping out bases—any Surface Book tablet can work with the no-GPU base, the old GPU base, or the Performance Base without problems—it's simply that Microsoft has elected not to sell them this way. I've heard suggestions that there are fit and finish concerns with doing this—that tablets and bases are matched together in the factory to ensure that they still show good alignment and clean lines even in spite of the minute variations in manufacturing that inevitably occur—but I daresay most Surface Book owners would tolerate a small visual blemish if it meant they could make such an upgrade. All in all, the Performance Base is a curiosity. Microsoft says that the Performance Base was driven by demands for more battery life and more graphical performance, and it certainly addresses those demands, but it feels like a bit of a stopgap. A proper Surface Book 2 is surely in development, and with a more complete redesign, it ought to be possible to get Kaby Lake and perhaps even a current generation GPU into the system. It's surprising that the desire for battery life and faster GPUs was apparently so immediate and so acute that Microsoft felt the need to get the new base out, and it suggests that perhaps Surface Book 2 is going to arrive later rather than sooner. As such, it's hard to know whether to recommend the Surface Book with Performance Base or not. If it had been released in 2015 then yes, without a doubt, it'd be the premium pick for Surface Books. In late 2016, though, it's much harder to recommend a system with a previous generation processor and no next-generation connectivity. If a Surface Book 2 were imminent we'd suggest holding off and waiting for that, but the very existence of the Performance Base implies that a Surface Book 2 isn't imminent. If the Surface Book form factor is really the one you want—and it certainly has its appeal—and you don't want to wait, then this is the system to get. I just can't quite shake the nagging feeling of it being a lot of money to spend on a machine that's essentially a year old. The Good The GPU is faster. The battery lasts longer. The Bad Fan noise under load. No way to buy the base standalone. The Ugly You're buying a 2015 machine in 2016. Expand full story Reader comments 61 You must login or create an account to comment.

Intel Kaby Lake HD Graphics 620 OpenGL/Vulkan Performance On Linux Written by Michael Larabel in Display Drivers on 10 November 2016. Page 1 of 3. 14 Comments Now having my initial Intel Kaby Lake Core i5-7200U MSI Cubi 2 benchmarks with Ubuntu 16.10 out of the way, this second article is focusing upon the HD Graphics 620 Kaby Lake performance with this latest stable Ubuntu release as well as when trying out Linux 4.9 and Mesa 13.1-dev. As outlined in that article yesterday, the Kaby Lake support out-of-the-box was good and even the i5-7200U's HD Graphics 620 were running out-of-the-box on Yakkety Yak with Linux 4.8 and Mesa 12.0. In this article are more Steam Linux gaming benchmarks from these latest-generation integrated graphics as well as our first Vulkan tests with Kaby Lake. The Ubuntu 16.10 stock environment (Linux 4.8 + Mesa 12) was tested followed by Linux 4.9 with Mesa 12 and then Linux 4.9 with Mesa 13.1-dev, in order to see if new Kaby Lake user's can expect any immediate benefits from switching to the newer open-source driver code. With Mesa 12, OpenGL 4.3 is exposed for Kaby Lake while switching over to Mesa 13 will expose OpenGL 4.5 support. The Intel "ANV" Vulkan driver was working out fine on both Mesa 12 and Mesa 13. These straight-forward benchmarks can be found on the pages ahead (or simply by continuing to read this page below, if you are a Phoronix Premium member helping to support the site). Plus with the benchmarking being done in a fully-automated and reproducible manner using the open-source Phoronix Test Suite benchmarking software you can easily compare your own Linux system's OpenGL/Vulkan results to the data in this article.

NTT DoCoMo will launch a trial 5G network in areas of Tokyo next year so that it can evaluate the performance of prospective 5G technologies in a live environment, it emerged this week. Ericsson is supplying the network equipment, including 5G radio, baseband, virtualised RAN, and core network infrastructure. Meanwhile, Intel will provide chipsets for use in trial end user devices. "DoCoMo and Ericsson have been working together on joint 5G projects including outdoor trials, and this is a further development of our joint efforts," said Seizo Onoe, NTT DoCoMo's chief technology officer, in a statement on Wednesday. "Adding Intel's expertise, we will be on track to evaluate the feasibility of services that leverage 5G technologies with ecosystem partner companies," he said. The trial will use 28-GHz spectrum, one of the candidate frequency bands currently being evaluated for 5G use by Japan's Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications. "This trial will represent an important milestone in 2017, paving the way for commercial 5G networks. It represents a unique opportunity to test real-life 5G performance in commercial conditions in the centre of Tokyo, enabling evaluation of consumer use cases and industry applications," said Arun Bansal, head of Ericsson's network products business unit.

At the celebration of International Day of the Girl Child organized by Girl Rising Nigeria in partnership with Intel, Maryam said the event was an avenue for girls in Kano and beyond to realize that they could achieve their dreams. “There are over five million girls out of school in Nigeria and most of these girls are in the northern part of the country. We cannot sit back and watch; we must do something. We must take the baton to lead the fight in ensuring that all girls, all children are educated. That is why we are here today”, Maryam stated. She further encouraged people to bring meaningful change to Kano and the world by empowering girls through education. This year’s theme of the International Day of the Girl Child is: “Girls’ Progress – Goals’ Progress: What Counts for Girls” which is focused at encouraging girls to see education as a ‘Must have’ with a goal to highlight the role of technology and the Internet as essential tools needed for leveraging all aspects of human endeavor in the current competitive dispensation. Also speaking the Corporate Affairs Manager, Intel Corporation, Babatunde Akinola said Intel is making efforts in several ways to encourage women and young girls to be technologically motivated, especially through the Company’s ‘She Will Connect’ initiative. He added: “Women do 60 per cent of world’s work, produce 50 per cent of food, and yet earn 10 per cent of income and own only one per cent asset”, Intel will continue to work with NGOs and other well-meaning organisations under the She Will Connect umbrella to enable, empower and connect girls and women to opportunities and consequently put an end to such gender gap”. Speaking about the partnership with Girl Rising Nigeria, Akinola reiterated Intel’s commitment to the development of the girl child. The Guardian NigeriaThe Guardian Nigeria What do you think?

X Ireland needs a trade strategy to avoid getting Trumped Trump’s ‘America first’ trade and tax policy will have major implications for Ireland Wed, Nov 9, 2016, 14:59 Padraig Cronin If Trump reduces corporate tax, Ireland’s ability to attract FDI from US companies such as Intel could be under threat.         Donald Trump will now have a major influence on the world, including Ireland, and his approach to taxation and trade will have major implications for Ireland. Whether we like him or not is irrelevant – his approach and stated tax and trade positions, which include lowering the federal corporate tax rate from 35 per cent to 15 per cent and to pursue an “America first” trade policy, could have a significant impact on our small open economy. We do not know whether Trump will do in office all the things he said he would do during the campaign. But he will serve four years as president at a minimum. Ireland needs to work with him, his administration and friends of Ireland in Washington. However, most critical now is for us to take a fresh look at our market position and foreign direct investment (FDI) strategy to ensure they will continue to work well for us in the changed US political landscape.   There are a number of options open to us including lowering our corporate tax rate of 12.5 per cent, seeking a more flexible application of EU fiscal rules which currently limit capital investment in infrastructure, and increasing our efforts to support the re-emerging indigenous sector. We must also focus on non-tax factors such as political and economic stability, our regulatory regime, labour availability, operating costs and market access in order to retain our FDI companies. Trump proposes lowering the US federal corporate tax rate from 35 per cent to 15 per cent and provide a deemed repatriation of corporate profits held offshore at a onetime rate of 10 per cent (payable over 10 years). Special deductions He proposes eliminating most corporate tax special deductions – expenses businesses can offset against profits for tax purposes – except for R&D. Firms engaged in manufacturing in the US may elect to expense capital investment and lose deductibility of corporate interest expense.

Journalists are helping to create a dangerous consensus US should consider Beijing-backed trade deal – Chinese media Under Trump’s stated corporate tax regime, US corporate tax would in future apply to a US-headquartered multinational corporation’s (MNC) worldwide income, with a credit given for taxes paid in other countries. This would end the current law’s deferral of tax on these profits until repatriated. Aligned to the above, he intends to pursue an “America first” trade policy. The underlying assumption is that his changes would bring a much higher level of annual economic growth, thus creating a larger economy, and that this would “pay” for the dramatic reduction in the corporate tax rate. From an Irish perspective, the concern is that large reductions in the US corporate tax rate and the repeal of deferral would reduce the incentive for companies to locate activities outside the US, including in Ireland. In particular, business functions that do not need to be close to a key market location will now be more likely carried out in the US than elsewhere. As tax will no longer be one of the key drivers of decisions as to where to locate, the focus of US businesses in future will be more on political environment, economic stability, regulatory regime, labour availability, operating costs, market access and so on. In essence, non-tax factors will determine the location of business activities. Solid footprint Ireland already does well in this regard: MNCs who are “talent seekers” choose Ireland because of its educated and experienced workforce. We will need to build on this solid footprint if we are to avoid any erosion in our MNC base. Ireland needs to review its FDI strategy to ensure it is fit for purpose in this new paradigm. Our 12.5 per cent transparent tax regime would no longer be a unique selling point. The force of attraction back to “home office” driven by a new US tax regime will negatively impact Ireland in terms of its FDI base of companies in the medium term. Hence, in the short term, we need to hone our market and brand proposition to adjust it to the new reality. An opportunity lies with regard to activities located in countries where the corporate tax rate is in excess of 15 per cent, eg France and Germany. Given that US MNCs would pay tax at 15 per cent on their worldwide income, they may become very focused on avoiding foreign taxes in excess of this rate. This could result in the relocation of non-local market critical functions in an EU context from countries such as Germany and France to say, Ireland. Obviously, such an evolution is only effective if the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base does not become a reality. Non-tax factors There are a number of actions Ireland must now consider. Given the focus on non-tax factors, more capital investment in infrastructure is critical. EU fiscal rules are currently limiting our ability in this regard. For 2017 total capital spending is to be €4.5 billion spread relatively thinly across areas, with roughly 25 per cent allocated to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, and 13 per cent allocated to education and housing respectively. The overall capital spending budget is set to grow to €6 billion by 2019 – to about 10 per cent of overall expenditure from about 7.5 per cent in 2016. Whilst this increase is welcome given the Brexit and now US “headwinds”, we need to achieve more flexibility from Brussels to allow greater capital investment in the productive capacity of the economy. Location is ultimately about real people and their families. Unless the housing, education and personal taxation “package” is made fit for purpose, we are at risk of our FDI base eroding, leading to negative growth over time. ADVERTISEMENT Finally, we need to redouble our efforts to support the re-emerging indigenous sector to ensure our economy has a better balance over the medium term.

X Ireland needs a trade strategy to avoid getting Trumped Trump’s ‘America first’ trade and tax policy will have major implications for Ireland Wed, Nov 9, 2016, 14:59 Padraig Cronin If Trump reduces corporate tax, Ireland’s ability to attract FDI from US companies such as Intel could be under threat.         Donald Trump will now have a major influence on the world, including Ireland, and his approach to taxation and trade will have major implications for Ireland. Whether we like him or not is irrelevant – his approach and stated tax and trade positions, which include lowering the federal corporate tax rate from 35 per cent to 15 per cent and to pursue an “America first” trade policy, could have a significant impact on our small open economy. We do not know whether Trump will do in office all the things he said he would do during the campaign. But he will serve four years as president at a minimum. Ireland needs to work with him, his administration and friends of Ireland in Washington. However, most critical now is for us to take a fresh look at our market position and foreign direct investment (FDI) strategy to ensure they will continue to work well for us in the changed US political landscape.   There are a number of options open to us including lowering our corporate tax rate of 12.5 per cent, seeking a more flexible application of EU fiscal rules which currently limit capital investment in infrastructure, and increasing our efforts to support the re-emerging indigenous sector. We must also focus on non-tax factors such as political and economic stability, our regulatory regime, labour availability, operating costs and market access in order to retain our FDI companies. Trump proposes lowering the US federal corporate tax rate from 35 per cent to 15 per cent and provide a deemed repatriation of corporate profits held offshore at a onetime rate of 10 per cent (payable over 10 years). Special deductions He proposes eliminating most corporate tax special deductions – expenses businesses can offset against profits for tax purposes – except for R&D. Firms engaged in manufacturing in the US may elect to expense capital investment and lose deductibility of corporate interest expense.

By Wayne Williams Published 2 weeks ago 33 Comments Tweet Last Wednesday, Microsoft revealed, among other things, an updated Surface Book. The following day, Apple introduced a new MacBook Pro. Both devices look great, sport powerful innards and come with a suitably high price tag. Which you go for will likely depend on whether you’re a fan of Microsoft or Apple, but if you’re not firmly entrenched in either camp, and need a little guidance to decide which laptop to go for, here are all the details you need. Obviously, the Surface Book i7 and MacBook Pro 2016 aren’t exactly like for like. The Surface Book’s display detaches, for one thing, and it’s touch screen, but let’s see how they compare generally. Design The new Surface Book keeps the same design as the previous one, including the slightly divisive hinge that means the book doesn’t fully close. The screen can detach from the body and be used as a tablet. The laptop has a magnesium alloy body. The new MacBook Pro is -- you guessed it -- lighter and thinner than previous models. It has an all-metal body, and keeps the same simple, but stylish look, albeit with a few tweaks, such as a much larger touchpad. Size and Weight The MacBook Pro is available in two screen sizes -- 13.3-inch and 15.4-inch. The Surface Book only comes in one size -- 13.5-inch. Because Apple is fixated with thinness, it’s no surprise to see the MacBook Pro is the slimmest product at 0.6-inches, versus Surface Book’s 0.9 inches. As for weight, the MacBook Pro weighs in at 3lbs for the 13-inch device, and 4lbs for the 15-incher. The Surface Book is 3.3-3.6lbs, depending on the model (dGPU models weigh more). Display As I mentioned earlier, the Surface Book’s screen detaches, while the MacBook Pro’s doesn’t. The Surface Book only comes in one screen size -- 13.5-inch, while Apple’s product can be had in 13.3-inch and 15.4-inch sizes. The Surface Book offers a higher resolution display -- 3,000 x 2,000, versus 2,560 x 1,600 for the 13-inch MacBook Pro, and 2,880 x 1,800 for the 15-inch model. The Surface Book has a full touch screen, and you can use it in tablet mode. The MacBook Pro has a Touch Bar, a long OLED Retina display that sits in place of the old function keys at the top of the keyboard. You can use this in various ways, and additional functionality will be added in time. Security The MacBook Pro offers Touch ID, so you can log into your laptop using a fingerprint. Surface Book doesn’t have a fingerprint scanner, but does have Windows Hello, which uses facial recognition to log you in. Processors The Surface Book and MacBook Pro can both be had in a choice of configurations, so you can opt for a sixth-generation Intel Core i5 or i7. The Surface Book offers either Nvidia GTX 965M GPU or Intel HD graphics, while the MacBook Pro has Integrated Intel Iris Graphics 540. The larger 15-inch model adds a Radeon Pro (450 or 455) chip for 3D gaming. Input The Surface Book comes with a Surface Pen, so you can draw on screen. That sort of behavior isn’t possible on the MacBook Pro, but you do get the Touch Bar and a super-sized touchpad with pressure-sensitive Force Touch technology. Battery Life If you’re a road warrior, the most juice you can get out of your laptop between charges the better. Apple’s battery life is not spectacular in this case. The new MacBook Pros promise around 10 hours of battery life, while the Surface Book claims between 12 to 16 hours. Storage and Memory The 13-inch MacBook Pro and the new Surface Book i7 are available in 256GB, 512GB and 1TB storage configurations. The 15-inch MacBook Pro can be had with a 2TB SSD. Memory-wise, both the MacBook Pro and Surface Book can be had with 8GB or 16GB of RAM. Ports Apple has come under some fire for its ports choices with the new MacBook Pro. It offers four USB-C ports -- that double as Thunderbolt 3 ports -- which can be used for Thunderbolt, USB, DisplayPort, HDMI, VGI, and charging. (The basic 13-inch model only has two USB-C/Thunderbird 3 ports). This means you may need a dongle to attach certain hardware. There’s no SD card reader. The Surface Book has two full-sized USB 3.0 ports, and an SD card reader. Software Apple's MacBook Pro runs macOS Sierra, while the Surface Book runs Windows 10 -- It’s Siri vs Cortana here. You could opt to install Windows 10 on your MacBook Pro if you want to, but you can’t install macOS Sierra on your Surface Book. Price The price for the entry-level MacBook Pro starts at $1,499, but you won’t get the Touch Bar for that. If you want the new Touch Bar, you’ll have to pay $1,799, which will get you the 13.3-inch display and the Core i5 CPU, 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. The price for the 15-inch MacBook Pro, with Core i7 CPU, 16GB of RAM, and Radeon Pro 450 graphics, starts at $2,399. The Surface Book starts at $1,349, for which you get the Core i5 CPU, 8GB of RAM, and a 128GB SSD. Opt for the i7 version, with 256GB SSD, and 8GB of RAM, and you can expect to pay $2,399. Choose the 1TB version with 16GB RAM and the price jumps to $3,299. Specs: Surface Book MacBook Pro Processor Intel i5, i7 Intel i5, i7 RAM 8GB/16GB 8GB/16GB Screen Size 13.5-inch 13.3inch/15.4inch Resolution 3000x2000 2560x1600/2880x1800 Graphics Intel HD -- Nvidia GTX 965M Intel Iris/-- Radeon Pro 455 Thickness 0.9-inch 0.6-inch Weight 3.3-3.6lbs 3lbs (13-inch)/4lbs (15-inch) Touch Control Full touch screen Touch Bar/Touch ID USB Ports 2 USB 3.0 Type A 2x (13-inch), or 4x (15-inch) Thunderbolt 3 Battery Life 12-16 hours 10 hours Summary For the money, the Surface Book provides a better all round deal, and the screen can be used as a tablet, which is a welcome bonus. The MacBook Pro is a svelte beast, with good looks, and future-proof ports which might require you to use a dongle or two for now, but which will be standard in the coming years. You also get a choice of screen sizes, which can be useful depending on your needs and personal preference. There's no right or wrong answer when it comes to which laptop you should get, only opinion.

In fact, the new MacBook Pro is outselling a number of competitive notebooks on the market, including Apple’s own 12-inch MacBook, according to Slice Intelligence. The data is most impressive because it’s based on just five days of sales for the 2016 MacBook Pro. In that brief span, the MacBook Pro generated 78 percent of the revenues that the diminutive MacBook has generated since its introduction on April 10, 2015. Generally speaking, the new MacBook Pro has already generated more revenue than any other notebook in 2016. More: How Intel’s Ultrabook initiative challenged the MacBook Air — and won Compared to the competition, the 2016 MacBook Pro has generated more revenue in its first five days than a number of competitive machines have since they were introduced. This includes Microsoft’s Surface Book, the Asus Chromebook Flip, Dell’s Inspiron 2-in-1, and the Lenovo Yoga 900. Slice Intelligence These results are particularly important for Apple’s long-term success, as Slice Intelligence points out. In the two years since the previous MacBook Pro refresh in 2014, fully 40 percent of Apple’s notebook customers moved on to other vendors. Dell and Asus were the biggest beneficiaries, with each gaining roughly 7 percent of Apple’s customers. Slice Intelligence While seeming like very good news for Apple, it’s entirely possible that these significant sales gains represent pent-up demand for new MacBook Pro hardware. The Windows 10 notebook ecosystem hasn’t been standing still, and time will tell if Apple can maintain these sales levels against excellent alternatives like Dell’s popular XPS 13 and the new thin and light — and more affordable — 2-in-1 convertible machines from HP, Lenovo, and others. Slice Intelligence gathers its data from 4.4 million online shoppers, so it doesn’t track all sales from every channel. Therefore, there’s room for interpretation of this data, although a general conclusion has to be that, at least initially, Apple is enjoying some renewed vigor when it comes to selling MacOS hardware. If the MacBook Pro is still selling at these levels in six months or so, then we can mark this as a tremendous success. Otherwise, it’s possible that Apple’s perceived lack of innovation could end up costing it even more customers as the market continues to move forward around it.

(SEV) ("Spectra7" or the "Company") today released its unaudited financial results for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016. A copy of the unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (the "Financial Statements") and the corresponding management's discussion and analysis ("MD&A") will be available under the Company's profile on www.sedar.com. All amounts are in US dollars unless otherwise stated. Q3 2016 Highlights Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $1.0 million, representing an increase of 11% compared to the $0.9 million for three months ended September 30, 2015. Nine month revenues were $6.2 million in FY2016 and $2.7 million in FY2015, representing 131% growth year-over-year; Gross margins for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were 55% and 58% respectively. Gross margin in Q3 was impacted by a reserve of $60K taken against an aging receivable. Subsequent Events in Q4 2016 The Board of Directors unanimously appointed Raouf Halim as CEO on September 26, 2016. Mr. Halim was the CEO of Mindspeed Technologies for 10 years during which he successfully executed a tripartite strategic transaction in which the wireless small cell system on a chip business was carved out and sold to Intel Corporation, while Mindspeed Technologies was acquired by M/A-COM for a 68% premium. The Company closed a C$6.7 million bought deal financing. The net proceeds will be used for research and development relating to the Company's virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and data center products for debt repayment, working capital and general corporate purposes. CEO Commentary on His First 45 Days with Spectra7 "While third quarter revenues were below what we expected, this was mainly due to a supply chain issue at a VR customer, which caused them to delay their purchase of Spectra7 products," said Mr. Halim. "We continue to expect that we will grow by approximately 100% year over year in 2016 over 2015. As I look ahead, I'm highly enthusiastic about the valuable opportunity pipeline across multiple vertical end markets." "Since accepting the CEO role, I have been meeting with key Tier 1 customers and analysts and reviewing Spectra7's operations. As we benefit from the ramp in VR and AR, we are also advancing our opportunity in the data center market. This is an untapped opportunity that we believe we can penetrate in calendar year 2017. Regarding our operations, I am confident that we can contain costs while remaining focused on key research and development activities supporting high growth market opportunities. I am pleased with the outcome of our recent financing, which along with these initiatives, puts us in a strong position to execute on our growth strategy," said Mr. Halim. Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality Markets "Over the last several weeks I have had the pleasure of meeting face-to-face with several Tier 1 VR and AR vendors that will shape the industry going forward. I am pleased to say that each of these key vendors is enthusiastic about Spectra7's patented active cable technology. Another key takeaway from these meetings was that VR and AR headsets are anticipated to remain a tethered solution for at least another five years as these products move to higher resolution 4K and 5K displays," continued Mr. Halim. Data Center Products "A major focus for Spectra7 in the next twelve months is to work to commercialize GaugeChanger™ in the data center market," continued Mr. Halim. "Early discussions with potential customers have been very promising and these potential customers immediately understand the product's value proposition. GaugeChanger™ has the potential to reduce both capital and operating expenses for data centers around the world. We expect GaugeChanger™ to be available for early installations in 2017." For in-rack connection lengths of up to 1.5m, GaugeChanger™ provides an ultra-thin 3.8mm outside diameter. For intra-rack lengths of 2m to 5m, the Company's GaugeChanger Plus™ provides longer reach at the same ultra-thin diameter. Passive copper links at this speed are up to 70% bulkier by cross-sectional area and up to 3 times heavier, putting a significant burden on rack spacing, air flow and density. As consumers and businesses continue to move their data to the cloud, the need for larger and more efficient data centers is growing rapidly. According to Canalys, total global data center investment will reach US$152 billion in 2016. Financial Summary Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 $1.0 million, representing an increase of 11% over the same period in the previous year. Revenue in the quarter however decreased by 61% from second quarter revenue of $2.6 million, due primarily to a supply chain issue at a leading VR customer, which caused the customer to delay its purchase of Spectra7 solutions. Year-to-date revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $6.2 million, representing an increase of 131% over the same period in the previous year. The increase in revenue was due primarily to the rise in the sale of the Company's embedded products in the growing AR, VR and media interconnect markets. Research and development expenses for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 increased by 8% over the same period the previous year. The Company has continued to invest a significant amount of resources in research and development with increases in engineering payroll and higher consumer material expenditures such as test boards, tape-out costs and production of prototypes. The data center operation has continued to progress since it was established in Little Rock, Arkansas in October 2015 and has added to the material and engineering costs. Research and development expenses for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 decreased by 21% over the same period the previous year. Expenses in the three months ended September 30, 2015 were high with the development of the Company's first generation of VR products. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company initiated cost saving measures to reduce the number of full mask tape-out costs, non-essential travel, the use of outside contractor services and the number part-time staff and hours. Sales and marketing expenses for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 increased by 14% over the same period the previous year. Sales and marketing expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by 38% compared to the same period the previous year. The decrease was as a result of the Company's efforts to manage costs through cuts in the number of part-time hourly staff and hours, by internalizing services previously provided by external contractors and through the reclassification of resources to research and development from sales and marketing. General and administrative expenses for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 increased by 13% and 21%, respectively, compared to the same periods the previous year. The increase was as a result of higher payroll costs, which included the appointment of a new Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Development in December 2015. The increase in general and administrative expenses in the three months ended September 30, 2016 was not as significant due to the one-time cost related to the graduation of the Company to the Toronto Stock Exchange during the same period of the previous year. Net loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $3.0 million and $8.1 million, respectively, a decrease of 30% and 26%, respectively, from the net loss for the same periods of the previous year. Other comprehensive loss relates to the unrealized foreign currency effect of translating the Company, whose functional currency is Canadian dollars, to US dollars for financial reporting purposes. For a complete discussion of expenses please refer to the Financial Statements and the MD&A. ABOUT SPECTRA7 MICROSYSTEMS INC.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media     Tech stocks continue post-election losing streak By George Avalos / November 10, 2016 at 10:46 AM Tech stocks plunged for the second day in a row after Donald Trump’s stunning presidential victory, a selling spree that engulfed big names like Google, Apple and Facebook. The SV 150 index of the Bay Area’s 150 largest tech companies tumbled Thursday, which was in sharp contrast to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which was flirting with record highs again. The broad-based S&P 500 rose and the tech-focused Nasdaq plummeted. Analysts offered plenty of theories about the troubles for the tech sector. One theory: Tech stocks have been on a great ride so far this year. It simply might be time for investors to take profits in their tech shares. For 2016 through the end of trading on Election Day, here’s how the Bay Area’s five largest tech stocks performed: Apple was up 5.5 percent, Google owner Alphabet had gained 4.4 percent, Facebook had soared 18.7 percent, Oracle had jumped 7.3 percent and Intel was up 0.8 percent. Two other notable tech stocks also had stellar years through Tuesday: Amazon had gained 16.6 percent and Netflix had rocketed 8.7 percent higher. Tech may be seeing opportunities and perils alike from Trump’s triumph, according to Scott Kessler, an analyst with CFRA Research. “We think a Donald Trump presidency coupled with a Republican-controlled Congress makes his proposal for a ‘repatriation of corporate profits held offshore at a one-time tax rate of 10 percent’ as much more likely,” Kessler said in a research note about the election results. “We see many large U.S. tech firms potentially benefiting, with increasing domestic growth investment, stock buybacks, and dividend payouts.” There’s a “but” in the Kessler analysis, however. “We note that Trump’s hard stances related to trade could negatively impact the tech sector,” Kessler warned. In 2015, tech companies captured about 58 percent of their revenue from non-U.S. sources. In contrast, S&P 500 companies derived an average 44 percent of the revenue from overseas sources, Kessler estimated. Trump during the campaign suggested that Amazon might have an antitrust problem. “Amazon is controlling so much of what they are doing,” Trump said in an interview with conservative commentator Sean Hannity. Trump raised concerns that Amazon’s success has undermined the prospects for traditional brick-and-mortar retailers. The president-elect also was unhappy that Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Post, which during the election campaign launched investigations into Trump and harshly criticized the businessman. What’s more, Silicon Valley, with the notable exception of venture capitalist and entrepreneur Peter Thiel, was almost universally, and publicly, opposed to Trump. Thursday, Bezos congratulated Trump about the victory in a tweet from his @JeffBezos account. “Congratulations to @realDonaldTrump. I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country,” Bezos tweeted.   Above: Images from the websites of Google, Apple, Facebook, Netflix and Amazon.

Creative Commons Zero Despite growing security threats, the Internet of Things hype shows no sign of abating. Feeling the FoMo, companies are busily rearranging their roadmaps for IoT. The transition to IoT runs even deeper and broader than the mobile revolution. Everything gets swallowed in the IoT maw, including smartphones, which are often our windows on the IoT world, and sometimes our hubs or sensor endpoints. New IoT focused processors and embedded boards continue to reshape the tech landscape. Since our Linux and Open Source Hardware for IoT story in September, we’ve seen Intel Atom E3900 “Apollo Lake” SoCs aimed at IoT gateways, as well as new Samsung Artik modules, including a Linux-driven, 64-bit Artik7 COM for gateways and an RTOS-ready, Cortex-M4 Artik0. ARM announced Cortex-M23 and Cortex-M33 cores for IoT endpoints featuring ARMv8-M and TrustZone security. Security is a selling point for these products, and for good reason. The Mirai botnet that recently attacked the Dyn service and blacked out much of the U.S. Internet for a day brought Linux-based IoT into the forefront -- and not in a good way. Just as IoT devices can be turned to the dark side via DDoS, the devices and their owners can also be the victimized directly by malicious attacks. The Dyn attack reinforced the view that IoT will more confidently move forward in more controlled and protected industrial environments rather than the home. It’s not that consumer IoT security technology is unavailable, but unless products are designed for security from scratch, as are many of the solutions in our smart home hub story, security adds cost and complexity. In this final, future-looking segment of our IoT series, we look at two Linux-based, Docker-oriented container technologies that are being proposed as solutions to IoT security. Containers might also help solve the ongoing issues of development complexity and barriers to interoperability that we explored in our story on IoT frameworks. We spoke with Canonical’s Oliver Ries, VP Engineering Ubuntu Client Platform about his company’s Ubuntu Core and its Docker-friendly, container-like Snaps package management technology. We also interviewed Resin.io CEO and co-founder Alexandros Marinos about his company’s new Docker-based ResinOS for IoT. Ubuntu Core Snaps to Canonical’s IoT-oriented Snappy Ubuntu Core version of Ubuntu is built around a container-like snap package management mechanism, and offers app store support. The snaps technology was recently released on its own for other Linux distributions. On November 3, Canonical released Ubuntu Core 16, which improves white label app store and update control services. The Snap mechanism offers automatic updates, and helps block unauthorized updates. Using transactional systems management, snaps ensure that updates either deploy as intended or not at all. In Ubuntu Core, security is further strengthened with AppArmor, and the fact that all application files are kept in separate silos, and are read-only. Ubuntu Core, which was part of our recent survey of open source IoT OSes, now runs on Gumstix boards, Erle Robotics drones, Dell Edge Gateways, the Nextcloud Box, LimeSDR, the Mycroft home hub, Intel’s Joule, and SBCs compliant with Linaro’s 96Boards spec. Canonical is also collaborating with the Linaro IoT and Embedded (LITE) Segment Group on its 96Boards IoT Edition. Initially, 96Boards IE is focused on Zephyr-driven Cortex-M4 boards like Seeed’s BLE Carbon, but it will expand to gateway boards that can run Ubuntu Core. “Ubuntu Core and snaps have relevance from edge to gateway to the cloud,” says Canonical’s Ries. “The ability to run snap packages on any major distribution, including Ubuntu Server and Ubuntu for Cloud, allows us to provide a coherent experience. Snaps can be upgraded in a failsafe manner using transactional updates, which is important in an IoT world moving to continuous updates for security, bug fixes, or new features.” Security and reliability are key points of emphasis, says Ries. “Snaps can run completely isolated from one another and from the OS, making it possible for two applications to securely run on a single gateway,” he says. “Snaps are read-only and authenticated, guaranteeing the integrity of the code.” Ries also touts the technology for reducing development time. “Snap packages allow a developer to deliver the same binary package to any platform that supports it, thereby cutting down on development and testing costs, deployment time, and update speed,” says Ries. “With snap packages, the developer is in full control of the lifecycle, and can update immediately. Snap packages provide all required dependencies, so developers can choose which components they use.” ResinOS: Docker for IoT Resin.io, which makes the commercial IoT framework of the same name, recently spun off the framework’s Yocto Linux based ResinOS 2.0 as an open source project. Whereas Ubuntu Core runs Docker container engines within snap packages, ResinOS runs Docker on the host. The minimalist ResinOS abstracts the complexity of working with Yocto code, enabling developers to quickly deploy Docker containers. Like the Linux-based CoreOS, ResinOS integrates systemd control services and a networking stack, enabling secure rollouts of updated applications over a heterogeneous network. However, it’s designed to run on resource constrained devices such as ARM hacker boards, whereas CoreOS and other Docker-oriented OSes like the Red Hat based Project Atomic are currently x86 only and prefer a resource-rich server platform. ResinOS can run on 20 Linux devices and counting, including the Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone, and Odroid-C1. “We believe that Linux containers are even more important for embedded than for the cloud,” says Resin.io’s Marinos. “In the cloud, containers represent an optimization over previous processes, but in embedded they represent the long-delayed arrival of generic virtualization.” When applied to IoT, full enterprise virtual machines have performance issues and restrictions on direct hardware access, says Marinos. Mobile VMs like OSGi and Android’s Dalvik can been used for IoT, but they require Java among other limitations. Using Docker may seem natural for enterprise developers, but how do you convince embedded hackers to move to an entirely new paradigm? “Rather than transferring practices from the cloud wholesale, ResinOS is optimized for embedded,” answers Marinos. In addition, he says, containers are better than typical IoT technologies at containing failure. “If there’s a software defect, the host OS can remain functional and even connected. To recover, you can either restart the container or push an update. The ability to update a device without rebooting it further removes failure opportunities.” According to Marinos, other benefits accrue from better alignment with the cloud, such as access to a broader set of developers. Containers provide “a uniform paradigm across data center and edge, and a way to easily transfer technology, workflows, infrastructure, and even applications to the edge,” he adds. The inherent security benefits in containers are being augmented with other technologies, says Marinos. “As the Docker community pushes to implement signed images and attestation, these naturally transfer to ResinOS,” he says. “Similar benefits accrue when the Linux kernel is hardened to improve container security, or gains the ability to better manage resources consumed by a container.” Containers also fit in well with open source IoT frameworks, says Marinos. “Linux containers are easy to use in combination with an almost endless variety of protocols, applications, languages and libraries,” says Marinos. “Resin.io has participated in the AllSeen Alliance, and we have worked with partners who use IoTivity and Thread.” Future IoT: Smarter Gateways and Endpoints Marinos and Canonical’s Ries agree on several future trends in IoT. First, the original conception of IoT, in which MCU-based endpoints communicate directly with the cloud for processing, is quickly being replaced with a fog computing architecture. That calls for more intelligent gateways that do a lot more than aggregate data and translate between ZigBee and WiFi. Second, gateways and smart edge devices are increasingly running multiple apps. Third, many of these devices will provide onboard analytics, which we’re seeing in the latest smart home hubs. Finally, rich media will soon become part of the IoT mix. “Intelligent gateways are taking over a lot of the processing and control functions that were originally envisioned for the cloud,” says Marinos. “Accordingly, we’re seeing an increased push for containerization, so feature- and security-related improvements can be deployed with a cloud-like workflow. The decentralization is driven by factors such as the mobile data crunch, an evolving legal framework, and various physical limitations.” Platforms like Ubuntu Core are enabling an “explosion of software becoming available for gateways,” says Canonical’s Ries. “The ability to run multiple applications on a single device is appealing both for users annoyed with the multitude of single-function devices, and for device owners, who can now generate ongoing software revenues.” It’s not only gateways -- endpoints are getting smarter, too. “Reading a lot of IoT coverage, you get the impression that all endpoints run on microcontrollers,” says Marinos. “But we were surprised by the large amount of Linux endpoints out there like digital signage, drones, and industrial machinery, that perform tasks rather than operate as an intermediary. We call this the shadow IoT.” Canonical’s Ries agrees that a single-minded focus on minimalist technology misses out on the emerging IoT landscape. “The notion of ‘lightweight’ is very short lived in an industry that's developing as fast as IoT,” says Ries. “Today's premium consumer hardware will be powering endpoints in a matter of months.” While much of the IoT world will remain lightweight and “headless,” with sensors like accelerometers and temperature sensors communicating in whisper thin data streams, many of the newer IoT applications use rich media. “Media input/output is simply another type of peripheral,” says Marinos. “There’s always the issue of multiple containers competing for a limited resource, but it’s not much different than with sensor or Bluetooth antenna access.” Ries sees a trend of “increasing smartness at the edge” in both industrial and home gateways. “We are seeing a large uptick in AI, machine learning, computer vision, and context awareness,” says Ries. “Why run face detection software in the cloud and incur delays and bandwidth and computing costs, when the same software could run at the edge?” As we explored in our opening story of this IoT series, there are IoT issues related to security such as loss of privacy and the tradeoffs from living in a surveillance culture. There are also questions about the wisdom of relinquishing one’s decisions to AI agents that may be controlled by someone else. These won’t be fully solved by containers, snaps, or any other technology. Perhaps we’d be happier if Alexa handled the details of our lives while we sweat the big stuff, and maybe there’s a way to balance privacy and utility. For now, we’re still exploring, and that’s all for the good.

Super-simply, the attack works like this: Choose two files, one you can write to and one you can’t, and get the kernel to load them both into memory. Write over and over again into the file you’re allowed to change. At the same time, tell the kernel over and over again that it can borrow back the memory used for the file you can’t change. Wait a short while. (A fraction of a second in our tests on 32-bit Intel Linux 4.4.19.) The vulnerability, officially called CVE-2016-5195, means that the kernel will eventually mix up the memory buffer that you’re writing into with the memory buffer you’re saying you don’t really need any more. As a result, you get to overwrite the read-only file, which is something of a security catastrophe if it’s a critical system executable or configuration file. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More This bug was in the Linux source code for the the last eleven years of kernel releases, and in theory affected every version on every platform during that time. We only tested it on what you might call a “regular” Linux distribution (for Intel CPUs), but it turns out that DirtyCOW affects Android running on ARM chips as well. That’s because Google’s largely proprietary Android ecosystem is built on top of the open-source Linux operating system, in much the same way as Apple’s macOS and iOS are built on a BSD-derived open-source core. A Github user going by Timwr has published a proof-of-concept project that shows how to replace the Android program called run-as. The idea of run-as is to allow an application to be run as if launched by a different user, just like Run As... on Windows. That’s useful in development and testing, but it’s also dangerous because run-as automatically acquires root privileges when it starts, and can pass its rootness on to the apps it loads. To keep things safe, the standard Google version of run-as therefore requires the user who started it to be root in the first place, as would be the case on a typical development or test device connected up for debugging. Loosely speaking, then, you can use run-as to root a phone, but only if the phone is already rooted in the first place. Clearly, replacing the admin-capable run-as program with a version that can be started by any user creates a gateway to root a phone permanently. The risk of rooting Google’s own Nexus and Pixel devices are sold so that they can be rooted if you like, and are thus commonly used by developers, but other vendors such as Samsung keep their phones locked down, Apple-and-Microsoft style. As a result, rooting – like its close cousin jailbreaking on Apple phones – is a popular pastime for users who want to do things differently. For many, it’s a way to remove what they see as vendor bloatware or to replace system apps with leaner, meaner or merely different variants. For others it’s a way to apply security patches that the vendor hasn’t got round to yet, or to update phones that the vendor no longer supports at all. And for some, sadly, it’s a gateway to piracy and other scofflaw shenanigans, including carelessly installing maliciously-hacked apps and making ill-advised configuration changes that introduce security problems that would otherwise have been avoided. In particular, an app that can “get root” can work around the data sandboxing restrictions imposed on regular Android apps, and thereby access files such as logs, messages, databases and other possibly personally identifiable information (PII) that would usually be off-limits. What to do? If you genuinely want to root your vendor-locked Android phone, DirtyCOW could be a handy way to get the job done, at least until your vendor’s next security update – though on some devices, that might be a dangerously long time. On the other hand, if you are a sysadmin looking after a menagerie of corporate devices, where the likely risk of rooting outweighs any potential benefits, you might not be so delighted at the prospect of easily-rooted devices. Worse still, dodgy off-market apps sometimes secretly use root exploits to get more power than you agreed to give them at install time, which is a danger to any organisation’s network. We suggest that you ask your Android phone vendors when their DirtyCOW updates will be available. PS. Sophos Mobile Control can help you to keep rooted phones off your business network by detecting that they’ve been rooted and taking corrective action. That could range from a simple popup warning, through the automatic removal of corporate email, to a forced remote wipe.

You never know what will you miss at the first setup. And YES indeed can harm the business network and maybe a bunch of computers. It’s always better to have a safe device, than tweaking these mini Android computers to your needs. If you just can’t live (work properly) with out it, just go for it, I am in. Great article Paul Ducklin, nice sharing! Reply Darren Chaker says: October 26, 2016 at 3:42 am As consumer demand the latest and greatest increases to simplify life, security flaws continue to increase with it. I truly wish as the world gets more connected that companies puts its products through serious security evaluations prior to releasing the product. Best, Darren Chaker Reply Alan Robertson says: October 26, 2016 at 10:15 am I’m going to go out on a limb here and say that *** if you know what you are doing *** then a rooted device can be far more secure than an unrooted device. For starters you can run a low level firewall that you can apply rules per application that allow you far more control over what can and cannot access the internet. Why should the android keyboard app have internet access? A low level firewall is only possible by rooting. “No Root” style firewalls work by proxying the traffic and are easily bypassed by malware using their own proxy settings. The same does not apply to a low level firewall. Similarly, anti virus cannot truly function properly at removing stubborn malware as it doesn’t have root privileges to remove the malware. If you are unlucky to run an app that later turns out to be malware and the AV doesn’t have a current signature for it then you are stuck with the malware and cannot effectively remove it. Yes, don’t use third party app stores etc. but it’s not like Google’s app store hasn’t been caught out with malicious apps, is it? You could also argue that removing Google Play from the device and only sticking with the existing apps supplied by the manufacturer is safer still, but I doubt you will find many people willing to do this. Also, what is that vendor supplied app doing on your device? The temptation to spy on users and sell the users habits to other companies is huge – especially if you can subsidise your device and make it cheaper for the consumer. Even if it is “just meta data” it can still reveal a lot about someone, and it’s not like your permission was sought prior to this being done. If the device is rooted then any unwanted apps that are installed by the vendor can be removed easily – again increases security. If malware can use a zero day or some other undocumented feature to access root privileges, then it gains complete control of the device. A rooted phone, on the other hand *** with additional security added *** can thwart the attempts of malware and prevent your device from being owned. As a side note, privacy guard is useful for preventing apps that request access to your personal data with blanket permissions. VPN’s / Orbot are useful for protecting your data in transit by encrypting everything even if the apps / browser are not using TLS. Orbot works best with rooted devices as you can TOR everything as opposed to Orbot aware apps. Choosing a good browser that respects privacy and allows you to change the settings to make it more secure is a good choice. Personally I favour Firefox, but then I’m an open source believer. Some useful Firefox settings: General, Home, Addons, Only over Wi-Fi General, uncheck Full-screen browsing Search, remove Amazon, Qwant, Twitter, Wikipedia Search, set Bing as default (Google asks for captchas all the time with Orbot) Search, uncheck Show search history Privacy, enable Do not Track Privacy, make sure Tracking protection is checked Privacy, Cookies, Enabled, excluding 3rd party Privacy, check Clear private data on exit (select all – you need to choose quit!)

Or if you are okay about using one of your digits and potentially having your biometric data being leaked then use a finger that’s not your index finger. Settings, Notification access, App Notifications: When device is locked, Hide sensitive notification content Turn off “Show on lock screen” for all apps apart from the ones you want. (Stops casual snooping) Security, Make passwords visible Off Location Off Turn off MMS auto download: Messaging, preferences, settings, adavanced, Auto Retrieve MMS – Off, off, off!!! Nobody needs MMS and it is used with many other exploits like Stagefright. In settings, security, trusted credentials. Turn off all the CA’s apart from: Comodo, Digicert, Geotrust, Globalsign, Go Daddy, Thawte, The Go Daddy Group and Verisign Seriously, you don’t need the rest – try it. No offence to the Hong Kong post office but the number of CA’s is getting ridiculous these days. Settings, data usage, click menu option, turn on enable data usage alerts and also apply network restrictions to your wifi connections (will warn if large files are being downloaded) Lastly – patch your phone! It’s YOUR responsibility and not the manufacturers to make sure you are safe online. Nor is it your IT departments responsibility to protect you. More to the point, if your phone is compromised and the “bad guys” used your phone to pivot to the company SQL database which ends up on paste bin, well I’m afraid it’s your neck on the chopping block (and IT will happily oblige with log files proving it). Reply Mahhn says: October 26, 2016 at 4:05 pm Alan, either you took a lot of time to write that, or you have some good configuration pages, that I would be happy to review. Thanks Reply Alan Robertson says: October 27, 2016 at 11:26 am Hello Mahhn, I’m just a tech head – that’s how I roll on the internet. Hopefully someone finds it useful! I’m a big Linux fan and I like the ethos of Sophos – particularly the no back door approach to security. I fully recommend the Sophos anti-virus on Linux as I don’t subscribe to the idea that Linux is immune to viruses. I would love to see more products by Sophos – keep up the good work guys! Reply cyber security salary says: October 26, 2016 at 3:02 pm Really interesting Paul, wasn’t aware the nexus was sold with the option of them being rooted! Reply Paul Ducklin says: October 26, 2016 at 4:43 pm You can turn on ADB (the Android Debug Bridge) to allow development access via USB and over a network, you can grant yourself access to a root shell, and you can unlock the bootloader to reflash pretty much any firmware you like. (At your own risk. The wrong firmware could crash the device so badly that you can’t reflash the firmware again, thus giving you an expensive brick.) You use the { } Developer options menu item on the Settings screen, but you have to enable it first. Go to Settings | About phone/tablet, find the Build number item and tap it seven times. Reply ustechninja says: November 10, 2016 at 6:03 pm I just wish more carriers would offer rooted versions of devices so devs didn’t have to exploit.

Image: Greg Fellmann/Shutterstock The line-up for the second Ireland’s Edge conference taking place in Dingle, Co Kerry this December has been revealed, including some of Ireland’s leading figures in the world of science, technology, engineering, art and maths (STEAM). The Ireland’s Edge conference is part of the Other Voices festival, held in one of the country’s most picturesque locations on 3 and 4 December and hosted by Inspirefest 2017 speaker Philip King. As the second conference of its kind at the festival, Ireland’s Edge in 2016 will focus on how the advent of STEAM could impact on Ireland’s distinct cultural identity, both at home and abroad, and our competitive advantage internationally. Familiar Inspirefest names Some familiar faces to those following Inspirefest and Siliconrepublic.com have been included in the line-up of speakers and performers, including the latter’s CEO and co-founder Ann O’Dea, as well as Zoe Philpott, the creator of the critically acclaimed show Ada.Ada.Ada. Day one of the conference is expected to begin with a keynote address from Dr Genevieve Bell, an Intel Fellow who works within its corporate strategy group. This will be followed by a discussion on how the creativity of the Irish people provides the country with a considerable advantage internationally, and how Ireland plans to harness this energy for future generations. Other speakers confirmed for the first day include Eamonn Sinnott, VP and general manager of Intel Ireland; John Mulholland, editor for The Observer; Martin Shanahan, CEO of IDA Ireland; and musician Caoimhín O’Raghallaigh. Speakers from across the spectrum The second day will focus on Ireland’s experiences of emigration in the 21st century, the Irish diaspora and the emerging drivers of cultural identity for the Irish overseas. These series of talks will include speakers like broadcaster and DJ, Annie Mac, as well as senior editor for news at CNN Digital International, Blathnaid Healy. This will be followed by a look at Ireland in 2016 and the evolution in our understanding of the Easter Rising 1916; the impact of the wide range of public, private, state and ceremonial celebrations; and the future of the 2016 legacy projects planned through 2017– 2021. This panel will be hosted by professor of modern Irish history at University College Dublin, author and broadcaster, Diarmaid Ferriter and will include director of Ireland 2016, John Concannon alongside journalist, author and broadcaster, Una Mullally. Speaking of the influence of such an event, King said: “In recent years, we have widened the programme to include thinkers, creators and leaders from across the worlds of culture, politics and enterprise and Ireland’s Edge is the culmination of many of these conversations. “In partnership with returning sponsors Intel, Ireland’s Edge will again play host to a stellar line-up of speakers from right across the spectrum of politics, media, business and art.” Related: Ann O'Dea, Inspirefest 2016, events, Kerry Colm Gorey is a journalist with Siliconrepublic.com editorial@siliconrepublic.com You May Also Like You May Also Like Discovery Inspirefest announces first batch of headline speakers for Dublin 2017 19 Oct 2016103 Shares Hiring Now Innovation for mobility and the internet of things Work smarter, live better Helping the world be well.

But after the former model and potential first lady gave one of her only stump speeches of the presidential race last Thursday (Nov. 3), vowing to fight cyber-bullying, Lady Gaga had a few things to say. The Joanne star -- whose Born This Way Foundation teamed with Intel earlier this year to fight online harassment -- responded to Melania's pledge on Sunday (Nov. 6) with a series of pointed tweets. "@MELANIATRUMP to say u will stand for "anti-bullying" is hypocrisy," Gaga tweeted. "Your husband is 1 of the most notorious bullies we have ever witnessed."  .@MELANIATRUMP to say u will stand for "anti-bullying" is hypocrisy.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News Schools Need Tools That Make Teachers' Jobs Easier in Real-Time To Raise ROI and ROL in EdTech DULLES, Va.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–The proliferation of bring-your-own-device (BYOD) and one-to-one (1:1) in K-12 classrooms continues to escalate, with profound impacts on the structure of the classroom and the delivery of lesson plans. In a 2015 teacher survey by the Consortium for School Networking, 55% expected two or more devices per student in three years, and 20% expected three or more. In a March 2016 teacher study by Market Intel Group, 91% said technology helps them tailor lessons and assignments to individuals’ needs, while 47% believe “more or better technology is a most important element to achieving their ideal classroom.” “EdTech produces gains only if it makes the delivery of education more impactful without overwhelming the user,” explained George Dotterer, CEO and co-founder of Verite Educational Systems Inc. “To maximize ROI, school leaders must track whether EdTech tools are achieving the desired return-on-learning and whether they can be integrated and operated with ease.” NetRef, a teacher-controlled, no-device-download technology for Internet management developed by Verite, offers special features that give teachers the minute-to-minute, 360° control they need to keep students on-task in connected classrooms. NetRef’s features help teachers easily link in all devices, facilitate blended learning, and manage classrooms independent of the IT staff. Reports by class or school help administrators evaluate how the tools are being used by teachers. From real-time visuals on student Internet activity to customized reports to website blocking, NetRef allows teachers to: Monitor individual devices in real time; Customize blended learning with tailored access by student or group; Implement multi-subject lesson plans simultaneously; Reinforce good learning habits, with immediate activity notification and Internet use reports; Facilitate independent or small group study; Mitigate exposure to inappropriate content with alerts when students are off-network; and, Generate aggregate reports across grades, departments or school-wide for smart budgeting decisions. When Dotterer couldn’t find a solution to protect his 12-year-old son online, he and his team designed NetRef to help keep children safe. With seamless and simple integration, NetRef offers umbrella protection across all systems, hardware and devices, minimizing distractions for students. NetRef and Verite Educational Systems Easy to use and integrate, NetRef is a new Internet management tool that helps teachers and students get down to the job of learning by managing access to the Internet on any device. Now operating in schools in ten states, NetRef allows schools to maximize their tech investment. Verite Educational Systems is a spin-out of Verite Group, which for over 12 years has provided Subject Matter Expert (SME) services, tailored tech solutions and managed network infrastructure for government programs and corporations.

The single-chip ISL9238 and ISL9238A battery chargers replace competitive two-chip solutions to reduce customer bill of materials (BOM) costs by up to 40%. Both ICs employ Intersil's patented R3™ modulation technology to extend battery life and deliver acoustic noise-free operation, superior light-load efficiency and ultra-fast transient response. The ISL9238 and ISL9238A operate in forward buck, boost or buck-boost mode to fast charge mobile battery packs with up to 4-cell Li-ion batteries. They also support USB 3.1 On-The-Go (OTG) with 5V/20V reverse buck, boost or buck-boost mode to deliver power out of a USB-C port for charging external devices such as smartphones, headphones or virtual reality goggles. At maximum power, both ICs provide 20V at 5A to the USB-C port for delivery of power up to 100W over a reversible USB Type-C connector cable. The ISL9238A features the same capabilities as the ISL9238, but also includes a different SMBus address for OEMs that want to use both ICs to design systems with dual USB-C ports. In charging mode, the ISL9238 and ISL9238A take input power from a wide range of DC power sources, including AC/DC charger adapters, USB power delivery (PD) ports and any travel adapter. Both chargers include SMBus and I2C programmable features such as depleted battery trickle charging, and a two-level adapter current limit for turbo-mode events where the charger takes advantage of the adapter's milliseconds of surge current capability to minimize power draw and extend battery run-time. The ISL9238 and ISL9238A also feature programmable autonomous charging and an end of charge safety timer to stop battery charging. "The new ISL9238/A USB-C buck-boost battery chargers give our customers more features, including 5V/20V reverse buck, boost and buck-boost modes, and the ability to add dual ports for two USB-C battery chargers in one system," said Andrew Cowell, senior vice president of Mobile Power Products at Intersil. "Mobile computing OEMs rely on Intersil to consistently deliver power management innovations that help them differentiate their products with thinner form factors and exceptionally long battery life." The ISL9238 and ISL9238A are pin-compatible with the ISL9237 USB-C battery charger and join Intersil's family of mobile computing power management solutions, including the ISL95852 Vcore PMIC, ISL95908 peripheral PMIC, and discrete PWM controllers (ISL95853/54/55/57). These ICs power IMVP8-compliant mobile systems using 6th and 7th Gen Intel® Core™ processors.

SK Telecom this week became the latest telco after Vodafone to join the recently-established 5G Automotive Association (5GAA). The industry group was established in late September by German car makers Audi, BMW and Daimler, as well as telco vendors Ericsson, Huawei and Nokia, and chip makers Intel and Qualcomm. Its mission is to develop, test and promote communications solutions that will enable a range of connected vehicle services, including driverless cars. In October, Vodafone became the first telco to join the 5GAA, signing up as a platinum member. Luke Ibbetson, Voda's head of R&D and technology strategy, joined the industry group's board. SK Telecom's joining will "contribute to the definition and development of next-generation connected mobility solutions," said the 5GAA's director general Dino Flore, in a statement on Sunday. "5G will enable the automotive industry to create new and innovative values through services including augmented autonomous driving, worry-free car management and rich in-car services," added Alex Jinsung Choi, CTO and head of SK Telecom's corporate R&D centre. He believes the 5GAA will "play a pivotal role" in "creating new business opportunities for both the mobile telecommunications and automotive industries," he said.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Thu, Nov 10, 2016 - Page 12　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Compal eyes notebook shipment rebound ENCOURAGING SIGN:The shipment forecast is seen as positive news for the company’s operations next year, as it is likely to suffer a 10% slump in laptop shipments this year By Lisa Wang  /  Staff reporter Compal Electronics Inc (仁寶), which makes notebook computers for Dell Inc, expects its notebook computer shipments to rebound 5 percent annually next year, backed by resilient replacement demand from enterprises, a company executive said yesterday. That means Compal is likely to outgrow the worldwide notebook market, which is expected to be flat, or rise at an annual maximum pace of 5 percent next year, according to Compal’s forecast. “The company’s growth [next year] is primarily based on our customers’ projections for 2017. Customers have optimistic outlooks about growth in commercial models next year,” Compal president Ray Chen (陳瑞聰) told investors at the company’s headquarters in Taipei yesterday. A growing number of enterprises plan to substitute older laptops with new ones running Microsoft Corp’s latest Windows 10 operating system next year, as Intel Corp’s new Kaby Lake processor does not support Microsoft’s last-generation Windows 7 system, Chen said. Rising demand from enterprises is expected to help lift the share of higher-priced commercial models to approach 50 percent of the company’s laptop shipments next year, from more than 40 percent this year, Chen said. Meanwhile, consumer laptop shipments are expected to decline slightly next year from this year, he said. The shipment forecast is seen as an encouraging sign for Compal’s operations next year. The notebook computer maker is to suffer a 10 percent annual slump in laptop shipments this year, compared with last year’s 40 million units, after Toshiba Corp, one of Compal’s clients, exited the PC market earlier this year, Chen said. Shipments of smartphones and tablets are expected to grow slightly next year, benefiting from customers’ share gain, Compal said. Compal makes iPads for Apple Inc and smartphones for Sony Corp and Lenovo Group Ltd (聯想). Commenting on analysts’ concerns about customers’ requests to relocate manufacturing to the US after Donald Trump won the presidential election, Chen said the likelihood would be slim, given much higher manufacturing costs. Compal yesterday posted a 25 percent year-on-year decline in net profit for last quarter due to sluggish customer demand and foreign-exchange losses. Net profits dropped to NT$2.18 billion (US$69.3 million) in the third quarter, from NT$2.89 billion a year earlier. Earnings per share shrank to NT$0.5 last quarter, from NT$0.67 in the same period last year. The company booked NT$822 million in foreign-exchange losses last quarter as the New Taiwan dollar appreciated against the US dollar. Compal booked a foreign exchange gain of NT$940 million in the third quarter last year, the company’s financial statement showed. Operating profits surged 34 percent to NT$3.46 billion last quarter, compared with NT$2.59 billion in the same period last year. Gross margin also improved to 4.4 percent last quarter, from 3.8 percent a year earlier. This quarter will be stronger than expected, Chen said. Laptop shipments are set to grow by between 5 and 10 percent from last quarter’s 9.5 million units. This story has been viewed 1551 times. Comments will be moderated.

By DC Velocity Staff Comment Few logistics trends have generated as much hype as the Internet of Things (IoT), that web of connected sensors that allows devices from trucks and forklifts to inventory and pallets to "talk" to each other and share data across the supply chain. Now, engineers at Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. Ltd. are looking to extend the IoT to the high seas. The South Korea-based shipbuilder recently signed a deal to create an "ecosystem for smart ships" with partners SK Shipping, Intel, Microsoft, the Ulsan Center for Creative Economy & Innovation, and the Daejeon Center for Creative Economy & Innovation. With a goal of enabling safe ship operation and improving crew well-being, the collaborators hope to develop "ship service software" and implement it as early as 2019 to allow for ballast tank inspection, remote medical treatment and services for crews, virtual reality training, automatic voyage information reporting, and maintenance for key equipment. The deal follows Hyundai's announcement in May that it would team up with consultant Accenture to create a smart ship system called OceanLink, serving the shipbuilding, shipping, and onshore-logistics sectors with a network of sensors and analytics software that can monitor a ship's real-time status and condition, including data on weather, location, onboard equipment, and cargo. #Software & Systems #Logistics Resources Mentioned In This Article Accenture Hyundai Heavy Industries Related Articles Convey launches retail shipment-tracking software Zebra launches mobile computers for retail tasks Descartes pays $2.7 million for Australian health-care software vendor Intelligrated launches software platform for robotic palletizing systems Freightos launches freight rate calculator More Videos » Technology Videos Orchestrating Your Next Best Move With Real-Time Visibility Logistics technology tools that matter Ruan: A Culture Enhanced by People, Process and Technology Join the Discussion After you comment, click Post.

It's done it for 2-in-1 laptops with the Surface Pro 4, and now it seems to have set the bar for all-in-one PCs with the Surface Studio. Just as the rumors and leaks foretold, the Surface Studio is a 28-inch all-in-one PC with a new iteration on Microsoft's PixelSense display, and an all-new way to control the device in the Surface Dial. What the rumors and leaks didn't prepare us for, however, was the price: a whopping $2,999 (around £2,450, AU$3,920; UK and Australia pricing is yet to be confirmed). How does the Surface Studio justify that astronomical price tag? By being a very strong contender for the title of 'Best All-in-One PC of All Time', that's how. Latest developments Since its reveal on October 26, the Surface Studio has done so well that it’s sold out until ‘early 2017’. Although limited quantities are expected to arrive as soon as December, there’s no telling when the vast majority of pre-sale units will land aside from the vaguely provided launch window.  If price is a concern, the Surface Pro 3 still holds its own Meanwhile, Microsoft isn’t the only one building computers for creative types. Dell, too, has shown off its all-in-one prowess with its Smart Desk PC. Both Dell and Microsoft appear to be challenging Cintiq rather than Apple by offering premium (in both price and quality) transforming displays on their desktop PCs. At least, by the time the Surface Studio does arrive, we’ll know more about Microsoft’s VR plans for Windows 10, while file sizes for updates will be diminished by 35% thanks to the UUP (Unified Update Platform). Lastly, if you previously weren’t sold on the Surface Dial, Mental Canvas 3D might change your mind. Design, feel and what's inside Microsoft touted on stage that, at 12.5mm at its thickest point, the Surface Studio is the thinnest desktop monitor ever created. The word 'monitor' is key there, as there's actually no hardware within the screen unit, as with most all-in-one PCs. Nay, Microsoft shoved all of that stuff – the processor, the graphics, the memory and the hard drive – into the tiny base that holds the 'zero-gravity hinge'. It makes for a beautiful-looking product that makes the hardware seem to disappear. The zero-gravity hinge absorbs all of the torque required to move the 13-pound display, making it shockingly easy to switch between its standard desktop PC orientation and that of a massive digital drawing surface. The chrome hinges on which the screen sits give the all-aluminum device a welcome touch of sheen. © Provided by Future Publishing Ltd. Using the device in its 20-degree-angled drawing orientation feels wonderful, even for someone who isn't a digital artist by any stretch. It's like having the most powerful Wacom tablet in the world, which just so happens to be a complete computer running Windows 10 Pro. The components inside allow for a seamless drawing experience, in that your taps, swipes and other stylus gestures are rendered so near 1:1 that it seems as instantaneous as creating physical art. Those components include up to a quad-core Intel Core i7-6820HQ processor at 2.7GHz, Nvidia's GTX 980M graphics chip with 4GB of memory, as much as 32GB of RAM and a hybrid hard drive as large as 2TB (128GB SSD).  All of this sits in the Mac Mini-like puck in the base, which in turn powers the 4500 x 3000 (!!!) touchscreen at 192 pixels per inch. © Provided by Future Publishing Ltd. Now, you might balk at the graphics chip from last year, and Microsoft hasn't had much to say about why this device doesn't include a 10-series Nvidia chip with the latest Pascal architecture.  Our best guess is that Microsoft started work on this way before Pascal was even a thing, and got the power it wanted out of the old-hat graphics processor.  Likewise, it's also running an older-generation Intel mobile processor, due to there not being any high-end Kaby Lake processors yet.  In our brief time with the device we didn't encounter any graphical performance issues that we think would be fixed with the absolute latest Nvidia graphics. While you could certainly game on this device, that shouldn't be the end goal for your three grand spent. All in all, the Studio feels like the most premium all-in-one we've ever laid hands on – and something we'd have no business working on short of a full TechRadar review. © Provided by Future Publishing Ltd. The Surface Dial, and how it works One of the most interesting bits about the Surface Studio isn't the all-in-one at all, but its brand-new accessory, the Surface Dial. This is a radial control module that operates over Bluetooth, just like the included Surface Keyboard and Surface Mouse.  But, unless you're pre-ordering a Surface Studio immediately as of this writing, you'll have to pony up an additional $99 to take advantage of it – here's why you might want to do that. The Dial offers specific controls in certain Windows apps, like the upcoming Paint3D, allowing for quick access to controls that you'd otherwise have to stop drawing to use. For instance, in Bing Maps, you can use the Dial to zoom and tilt a 3D map image. © Provided by Future Publishing Ltd. In an app like Paint3D, you can access all sorts of color swatches and pen or brush styles by simply long-pressing the Dial. Then, you just turn the dial to your desired selection, and press in once.  Better yet, the Dial can interact with the Surface Studio screen to make its radial options around the device when it's placed anywhere on the screen's surface. Imagine drawing something with the Surface Pen in your right hand and immediately changing the color of your input with the Dial in your left hand. It's a marvel to watch, much less try yourself. Of course, the Surface Dial is one of those accessories that only digital artists and other creative professionals are going to get the most out of. But that's who the Surface Studio is aimed at anyway: digital artists that are sick of using separate surfaces to create on. © Provided by Future Publishing Ltd. Early verdict Microsoft may very well have set another high bar in a hardware category that hasn't seen much innovation geared toward professionals in a while, save for advances in resolution. You might balk at the price, and chances are that, if you do, then you don't work for a design firm or do freelance digital artwork. And, with such an exorbitant price, it's as if Microsoft knows that. That's compounded by the fact that the company is releasing the Surface Studio in limited quantities for the holidays, and it has kept tight-lipped on international pricing and availability as well. From its gorgeous touch display that can switch between DCI-P3 and sRGB color profiles in an instant to its awfully powerful innards and clever design, Surface Studio is the most beautiful and complete all-in-one we've ever seen. The Surface Studio might not be for all of us in the same way a Surface Pro 4 might be, but that's not the point. The point is to lay a figurative mic drop on the tech vendors powering the creative industry, and we think it's done just that.  © Courtesy of techradar.com techradar.com image Go to MSN Home More in News Obama warns of rise in 'crude nationalism' after Brexit and Trump victory International Business Times Merkel suggests she is willing to compromise on free movement The Telegraph Supreme court judge hints at legal hitch that could seriously delay Brexit The Guardian Mayor 'quits' after outcry over racist comment on Michelle Obama Reuters Anglo-Saxon graves in Norfolk thought to be oldest found in UK The Guardian 'Black people much more likely to be jailed over criminal offences' The Independent Up Next Iraqis travel on UK taxpayers' money to give proof against UK war veterans The Telegraph More in News IVF mum marries donor after tracking him down and falling in love Mirror Tracking an elusive diary from Hitler's inner circle The New York Times £1bn Madonna becomes highest-grossing solo touring artist ever Evening Standard AdChoices AdChoices More from TechRadar The best movies on Netflix: great films you can watch in Australia right now TechRadar Quick!

Yesterday it apparently published details and pictures of a range of LGA 1151 socket motherboards built around Intel Z270 and H270 chipsets. At the time of writing the details look to have been taken down. Four Kaby Lake desktop gaming motherboards were listed, all described as 'Powerful Gaming' boards. I've put together a summary of the boards below with details courtesy of WCCF Tech : SuperO C7Z270-CG A full sized ATX in black & green (for Nvidia fans?). The motherboard features a substantial VRM section with heatpipe cooling. It is designed to be seen with its conspicuous SuperO branding and I/O cover. This motherboard features 4x DDR4 DIMM slots (up to 64GB). You can also see 3x PCI-e 3.0 x16 slots and 3x PCI-e 3.0 x1 slots present. Two M.2 slots provide support for next gen flash storage devices and you can also see 2x U.2 ports near the 6x SATA 6GB/s connectors. SuperO C7Z270-PG The SuperO C7Z270-PG Offers the same chipset and similar features to the above 'CG' suffixed board, but a more modest appearance and a few features cut down. For instance it has 4x PCI-e x16 slots and only a single PCI-e 3.0 x4 slot. Storage is catered for by 2x M.2 slots plus 6x SATA 6GB/s connectors. (pictured below, left). SuperO C7Z270-CG-L This red and black board (pictured above, right) has 2x PCI-e 3.0 x16, 3x PCI-e 3.0 x1, a single PCI-e 3.0 x4, 2x M.2 slots, and 6x SATA III 6GB/s ports. Apparently it will cost below $200. SuperO C7H270-CG-ML This is the sole H270 chipset motherboard that was listed. It is a micro-ATX size board so obviously has a much reduced component area. Nevertheless it still sports 4x DDR4 DIMM slots like all the above boards. For expansion cards you have one of each of the following; a PCI-e 3.0 x16, a PCI-e 3.0 x4 and a PCI-e 3.0 x1 slot. Storage devices can be connected via the single M.2 or via the 6x SATA 6GB/s connectors. This board should cost $150 or less. Remember these Kaby Lake boards are waiting in the wings until the desktop 7th gen Core chips are released by Intel early next year. So these boards will probably be made available at that same time. On the way to that time I'm sure we will see more leaks about the processors and supporting motherboards. Only last week we saw a full review of an Intel Core i5-7600K published by Chinese tech site PCOnline (installed on a Z170 motherboard).

More than 5,200 OpenStack professionals and enthusiasts gathered in Barcelona, Spain to attend the 2016 OpenStack Summit. From the keynotes to the break-out sessions to the marketplace to the evening events and the project work sessions on Friday, there was plenty to keep attendees busy throughout the week. In fact, if you were one of the lucky ones who attended OpenStack Summit, there was probably many sessions and activities you wanted to make it to but couldn’t. Red Hat was very busy throughout the week as well, as we participated in 49 sessions, staffed a booth in the marketplace with five demo stations, announced several new and exciting customers, hosted and co-hosted evening events throughout the week, and held hands-on, intensive training through OpenStack Academy. So if you weren’t able to make it to every Red Hat session, or couldn’t go to the Summit at all, here is a recap of everything we did. Announcements With Ericsson, we announced a new alliance to enable the adoption of open source solutions. In addition, we announced several new customers who are having great success with OpenStack in deployment: Finally, we announced the results of our second annual customer survey, gathering their thoughts on key topics related to OpenStack, including deployment, management tools, and containers. Sessions Dozens of Red Hat’s OpenStack experts delivered or co-delivered almost 50 sessions at OpenStack Summit. Here is a listing of them all, with links to the recorded version.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Microsoft has stopped selling Windows 7 Professional, Windows 8.1 Microsoft has stopped selling Windows 7 Professional, Windows 8.1 By Joel Hruska on November 2, 2016 at 7:30 am Comment As of yesterday, Microsoft has stopped selling Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 to system builders. The only way to acquire a copy of these operating systems now is to buy the dwindling stock still available online. Technically, most versions of Windows 7 were pulled off the market two years ago, but Windows 7 Professional was still cleared for sale until October 31, as were all of the flavors of Windows 8.1. The chart below shows Microsoft’s sales chart for preinstalled versions of Windows. Windows 10 is listed as being supported indefinitely because, according to Microsoft, it’s the last version of the operating system they’re going to build. Whether that’s actually true is a different question altogether, and I ultimately expect it isn’t. There’s a great deal of institutional expectation built into the idea of periodically updating one’s operating system, and Microsoft is the only company currently claiming its current OS is now a static flavor. Android, iOS, and macOS all still use version numbers, and I expect Microsoft will eventually release a “Windows 11” as well, even if it automatically extends upgrades to all current users of Windows 10. As for support, Microsoft also publishes a schedule for this: After a number of fits and starts, Microsoft has agreed to fully support Windows 7 and 8.1 on all Intel Skylake and AMD Carrizo platforms through the planned end date for security fixes for those operating systems (January 2020 and 2023, respectively). Future platforms, like Kaby Lake, Bristol Ridge, and all future APUs from AMD will only be supported on Windows 10. We’ve previously discussed the long-term difficulty of keeping legacy hardware operational on unsupported platforms — the long and short of it is that while it’ll probably be possible to shoehorn Windows 7 or 8.1 on to newer hardware, it’ll get progressively difficult as chipset drivers change and new hardware capabilities are added to both platforms. This could be particularly problematic on laptops, where a lack of support for modern power management baked into newer chips could lead to poor battery life. Windows 10 adoption has slowed in the general populace, but gamers continue to adopt the OS in fairly large numbers. Windows 10 64-bit holds 47.28% of the Steam market, with Windows 7 64-bit hanging on at 28.99%. Windows 8.1 64-bit is in third place, at 8.63%. Thanks to the WayBackMachine, we can see how adoption has shifted over the last 12 months. In 2015, Windows 7 64-bit was the most popular OS at 37.48%, with Windows 10 64-bit at 23.99% and Windows 8.1 64-bit at 18.62%. This confirms a trend that we’ve noticed before: Windows 7 users are noticeably more “sticky” than Windows 8.1 owners, or older users on 32-bit operating systems. While shares of both older OSes have dropped, Windows 7 64-bit is down 8.49%, while Windows 8.1 64-bit is down 10%. Whether this reflects user unwillingness to update off Windows 7 or the fact that more Windows 7 owners had older hardware and are less likely to be on an upgrade path in general is not clear.

Tech Beach Retreat will offer a global ecosystem of technology entrepreneurs, investors, innovators and influencers, creating a gateway for commerce through the convergence of three potential pillars of growth for Jamaica and the Caribbean: Entrepreneurship + Technology + Innovation. The newly added speakers include Dr Kingsley Chin, founder and CEO of KIC Ventures. Chin emigrated from Jamaica in 1984 with $47 in his pocket to attend Columbia University in New York on a soccer scholarship. Being the first in his family to attend college, he set out to prove himself capable of achieving the highest level of success at every level. He excelled as a scholar athlete and was the Ivy League Player of the Year, president of his senior class, and a member in the Electrical Engineering Honours Society Eta Kappa Nu. Chin gained business experience at AT&T Bell Labs and Accenture, where he consulted at Cigna Insurance and Goldman Sachs. He then attended Harvard Medical School and graduated with honours and four diplomas. Chin is an orthopedic spine surgeon and was chief of spine surgery at the University of Pennsylvania for four years, where he began developing KIC Ventures. Chin spends up to 10 per cent of his time teaching as a professor and in clinical practice and research. For the past 10 years his focus has been managing funds with KIC Ventures, investing US$190 million to build a portfolio estimated at US$1 billion. Marlon Nichols, another great Jamaican from the diaspora, will also be attending Tech Beach Retreat. Nichols is co-founder and general partner at Cross Culture Ventures (CCV), an early-stage venture capital firm with a focus on cultural investing (global trends and shifts in consumer behaviour). Before founding CCV, Nichols was an investment director at Intel Capital where he completed his Kauffman Fellowship. Prior to his time in venture capital, Nichols worked in software and strategy consulting in the technology, private equity, media and entertainment sectors. Some of his investments include Afrostream, Gimlet Media, Hingeto, LendStreet, LISNR, Mark One (Vessyl), Mayvenn, Mirantis, MongoDB, mSurvey, Sidestep, Skurt, and Thrive Market. Nichols was named to Silicon Republic’s list of 26 venture capital professionals spearheading change in technology investing, was a recipient of Digital Diversity’s Innovation & Inclusion Change Agent award, and was named a member of the theRegistry’s 40 under 40 Top Diverse Talent. Bedy Yang, managing partner at 500 Startups, is also lined up for Tech Beach Retreat. 500 Startups is a leading seed and incubator fund in Silicon Valley. The company provides early-stage companies with funding and mentorship from more than 200 experienced start-up mentors. Yang has invested in more than 50 start-ups, not only in Brazil and Spanish speaking countries, but also in Kenya and Russia. In addition to 500 Startups, Yang founded Brazil Innovators, an organisation that became the epicentre and resource for Brazilian tech founders. Before 500 Startups and Brazil Innovators, Yang worked as a management consultant specialising in distribution and go-to-market strategies for Fortune 500 companies in Brazil. She has also worked as social entrepreneur, creating opportunities for women and indigenous tribes in Brazil and China. Yang holds a BA at FundaÃ§Ã£o GetÃºlio Vargas and MLA (East Asian Studies) from University of Pennsylvania. She speaks Chinese, English, Portuguese, and Spanish fluently. The fourth new participant for Tech Beach Retreat is Vijay Pradeep, a senior engineer with Google. Pradeep is a robotics engineer and angel investor based in Silicon Valley, and has been involved in the robotics sector for over a decade. He was a co-founder of hiDOF Inc, a Silicon Valley robotics consulting firm that has worked with Fortune 500 companies and start-ups in a variety of areas, including VR/AR, vehicle autonomy, medical imaging, drones, personal aviation, and industrial automation. His team has since joined Google’s Daydream VR effort, where Vijay is now a senior engineer and leads the sensor characterisation and factory deployment teams for Tango: Google’s handheld AR/VR platform. Pradeep received his Bachelor of Science in Computer Systems, focusing on robotics and mechatronics; and his Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering, focusing on control systems – both from Stanford University in California. His academic contributions have been showcased in a variety of robotics conferences, journals, and books, and his contributions to Robot Operating System and the PR2 robot platform are now used widely in the open-source robotics community.

Open Hardware Monitor is a free tool for monitoring CPU load, clock speed and temperatures, fan speeds, voltages, video adapters, RAM usage and more. The new build brings much-need hardware support for Intel Skylake CPUs, along with Kaby Lake, Airmont and i5, and the Xeon E5-26xx v4 and D-15xx. Added support for the ITE IT8620E, IT8628E, and Nuvoton NCT6102D/NCT6106D super I/O chips should get the program working with many more motherboards. There’s now more information available for NVIDIA RAM, Samsung and Plextor SSDs. The Plot window has smarter and more customisable handling of pen colours, and there are a few bug fixes thrown in. READ NEXT: SoftPerfect File Access Monitor now freeware The program is still a tiny download, only 502KB. The interface is basic but functional, and it’s easy to generate charts of whatever attribute you’d like to monitor. Open Hardware Monitor delivered reasonable results on our test laptop, displaying accurate details and figures for our CPU, motherboard, hard drive and more. The program couldn’t give us any information on our GPU temperature or load, despite identifying it correctly, but we’ve no idea how widespread that kind of issue might be. If you’re interested in hardware monitors, check it out anyway– there’s no installation required and it still runs on Windows XP or later. Open Hardware Monitor is an open-source tool for Windows.

ROGERS Apple MacBook Pro late 2016. Photo courtesy of Apple - + In the days following the announcement of the latest MacBook Pro computers, reports followed the usual pattern. The MacBook Pro misses the boat; Apple is doomed; Tim Cook should be replaced; and there were the usual questions about "what would Steve Jobs have done/said/thought?". An Apple product is like an iceberg: only a small part is visible above the surface; most is hidden. Some questioned the 16GB maximum memory in these Macs. When asked why 32GB was not an option, Phil Schiller said that this was because it "wouldn't be power-efficient enough for a notebook". Many thought this was another example of Schiller-speak, until IT journalists did some research. When Intel releases suitable Kaby Lake processors, things will be different. Although processor speeds have not changed much, components work faster: bus speeds are improved and sequential read speeds for the solid state drives' read/write speeds are 3.1 and 2.1GB per second. Many commented on the provision of USB-C ports only (plus the headphone connector), which means those with older devices will need new adapters or cables. Apple eased the pain a little at the end of last week by reducing prices in the USA of several adapters. There is no information about whether these lower prices will hold here. There are also reports that some older Thunderbolt 3 adapters with Texas Instruments controller chips do not work. Commentators expect this will be fixed with a firmware update. Apart from the higher prices (I will be mortgaged into the next century by the 13-inch model I want), a surprise for me was the lack of a start-up chime. As these new Macs have instant-on capabilities, this was silenced in case anyone starts the Mac up in a meeting, although I have heard plenty of Macs and PCs being booted up here and no one seems to care. Fortunately, the reliable Christian Zibreg (iDownload Blog) outlined the process to bring the chime back using Terminal. This will be one of my first acts after configuration, when I am able to buy one. If anyone in Thailand wants one of these new computers now, the Buy buttons on the Apple site are still greyed out. Orders in the USA are showing wait times of four or five weeks. I am sort of hoping for a late November release here, but I am not a betting man. I am learning more about the Apple Watch Series 2 that I am running, not the least is how to take screen shots. I now hold the watch's side button and immediately press the crown. The iPhone 7 also needs some dexterity with a press to the side (screen off) button, followed by a touch on the Home button. If you press the Home button first, Siri offers to help. I am pleased with the improved battery life of the Watch. With the first version I would expect to see around 50-55% of life at the end of the day; but the Series 2 is rarely below 75%. I am the wrong person to ask about battery life as my iPhone is in constant use all day, especially with messaging: as before, the Apple Watch takes some of the slack there when I am travelling (bus, taxi, BTS) allowing me to filter out less important messages, or reply sometimes with an emoji. There are now more apps that run on the Watch, like my Withings app that displays several health monitoring data items. Information is taken from Apple's Health app and from devices such as the blood pressure measurement unit I use. I have also added a new maths app, 6284 Calc, by Amit Kalra (@AMITNKALRA), a 16-year-old student from San Francisco who fell behind in class. He built the app to help him, which I think is a greater achievement than unsuitable classroom learning. This is still being developed and it is expected more features will be added. Another neat app is Night Sky 4, which shows stars in the sky from whichever direction the watch is pointed. Remember there are some below the horizon: these are shown too. The display on the iPhone is much clearer of course, but on the watch I can see quickly which stars (and constellations) I am looking at. Heart rate, music, phone and calendar are among the apps I have added to the Dock, giving me quick access to these services. I also have Maps directions on the Dock, which can be automatically opened on the iPhone for a better view when I want it. A quick glance at the watch is often enough to help me navigate the streets without constantly looking at the iPhone. Graham K.

(PRWEB) November 10, 2016 Acer today announced that it has earned three CES 2017 Innovation awards for its monitors and notebooks, including the top prize in the computer peripherals category with a “Best of Innovation” award for its Predator Z301CT gaming monitor. It was also named an “Honoree” twice in the computer hardware and components category for its Swift 7, the world’s thinnest notebook(1), as well as the Spin 7, the world’s thinnest convertible notebook(2). Products entered in this prestigious program are judged by a preeminent panel of independent industrial designers, independent engineers and members of the trade media to honor outstanding design and engineering in cutting edge consumer electronics across 28 product categories. The Best of Innovation award for the Predator Z301CT monitor means that the judges deemed it to be the most impressive technology in the computer peripherals category and that it scored higher than all other entries. The Predator Z301CT is the world’s first 21:9 curved monitor with eye-tracking functionality(3). The monitor’s eye-tracking technology adds to a gamer’s arsenal of control tools, helping them to intuitively aim, target and shoot faster than competitors who only have access to a keyboard and mouse. Other key features include a 30-inch 1800R curved ultra-wide full HD 2560×1080 screen, stutter-free visuals with NVIDIA G-Sync technology, a rapid 200Hz refresh rate, fast 4ms response time and 178-degree viewing angles. The Acer Swift 7, the world’s thinnest notebook, was selected as a CES 2017 Innovation Honoree in the computer hardware and components category. It measures less than 1cm thin (0.39 inches) and weighs 2.48 pounds, providing incredible portability and up to 9 hours of battery life(4). It offers an elegant, all-aluminum uni-body design with Corning Gorilla Glass for superior durability and scratch resistance. Its gold inner surface contrasts with a matte black exterior, while an extra wide Precision Touchpad with chamfered diamond-cut effects provides modern, luxurious aesthetics.

The company will demonstrate both products at today’s CES Unveiled event in New York. “We are honored to be selected as a CES Innovation Awards Honoree for two years in a row,” commented Aurangzeb Khan, President and CEO of Altia Systems. “PanaCast 2s delivers 78% higher video resolution than Panoramic-4K and the PanaCast 3D VR kit delivers 4K 3D video with real time, in-device stitching, providing industry-first capabilities which enhance video collaboration, education, telemedicine, virtual / augmented reality experiences, and enable high-performance edge analytics for Internet of Things or ‘IOT’ solutions.” PanaCast 2s PanaCast 2s comprises of a PanaCast 2 device and the PanaCast Computer Vision Engine (PCVE) software. It delivers 7.4 Megapixel panoramic video in a 180° wide by 54° tall field of view, with 5120 x 1440 pixels per frame, at 30 frames per second, with less than one frame latency. Ram Natarajan, CTO of Altia Systems said, “The core IP we’ve invented and developed allows us to synchronize, stitch and optimize video from multiple cameras to create a natural-looking panorama. PCVE is an industry first, scalable architecture implementation with an optimized OpenCL pipeline which runs on standard OpenCL-capable processors. The PanaCast 2s camera system delivers 78% higher resolution than Panoramic-4K, and the three camera system also enhances the likelihood of looking at an object orthogonally, when compared with conventional cameras. Together, these capabilities help improve the range and accuracy of object recognition and tracking. The low latency flow-through software architecture can be extended to create 8K and beyond immersive video. PanaCast 2s provides new capabilities to the business, industrial and consumer markets. For example, it delivers ~5x lossless digital zoom in video conferencing, and, when viewed on head-mounted displays, it provides better resolution for each eye.” PanaCast 3D VR Kit The PanaCast 3D VR Kit consists of two PanaCast 2 cameras mounted at the inter-pupillary separation of 70 mm, operated concurrently in a biomimetic / stereo system with software which stacks the in-device stitched left eye/right eye real-time video streams in a 4K frame (3840 x 2160 pixels per frame). The PanaCast 3D VR Kit enables natural depth perception with a responsive system which mimics the human field of view. The PanaCast 3D VR kit brings immersive 3D experiences within reach of content creators interested in creating virtual reality (VR)/augmented reality (AR)/mixed reality experiences through real-time interaction, i.e., rapid prototyping and experimentation to get the best possible effect. The ability to preview videos in real time with a ‘what you see is what you get’ view allows consumers and professionals alike to record and share content with point-and-shoot simplicity. The fully stitched 3D content can be recorded and uploaded immediately without spending time and money on post-production techniques and proprietary stitching software. Sharing is made simple as the kit produces videos with live preview support and can be used by any broadcast app – such as Wirecast, Facebook Live or YouTube 360. The fully stitched 3D video is available for instant viewing on smart phones with the Google Cardboard head-mounted display (HMD) or other low-cost HMDs, as well as high-end HMDs. On an HMD, the experience resembles what one would see on an immersive, cinematic screen, in 3D. “By providing fully stitched 3D content, in real time, with 4K resolution, in a small and light package, the PanaCast 3D VR Kit extends the reach of 3D content to industrial and commercial applications such as structural inspections using drones, news reports, education, virtual home and store tours, tourism, entertainment, etc.,” said Naveed Alam, VP of Software Engineering at Altia Systems.

Machine learning is sort of like that kid – deep, wide, and short – and not so tall. But on the serious side, machine learning today is useful for a wide variety of pattern recognition problems, including the following: Image classification. Speech processing. Handwriting recognition. Text processing. Threat assessment. Fraud detection. Language translation. Self-driving vehicles. Medical diagnosis. Robotics. Sentiment analysis. Stock trading. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, has progressed rapidly during the past decade due to: Big data – an increased availability of large data sets for training and deployment has also driven the need for deeper nets. Deeper nets – deep neural nets have multiple layers, and often possess higher-order architecture (width) within a given layer. Clever training – it was discovered that a large dose of unsupervised learning in the earlier stages of training allowed for the net to do its own automated, lower-level feature recognition and extraction, and pass those features on to the next stage for higher-level feature recognition. High performance computing – clustered systems, enhanced with accelerator technology, have become essential to training large deep nets. In deep learning, the key computational kernels involve linear algebra, including matrix and tensor arithmetic. A deep neural net can have millions or even billions of parameters due to their rich connectivity. While depth refers to the number of layers, the layers can also be quite wide – with hundreds to thousands of neurons in a given layer. The weights of these connections must be adjusted iteratively until a solution is reached in a space of very high dimensionality. Because of the large number of parameters and the generally modest accuracy required for the final output – is this image a cat? or is this a fraudulent application? – low-precision arithmetic typically suffices. Training can be successful with floating point half precision (16 bits) or with fixed point or integers (as low as 8 bits in some cases). This is the short aspect. Yann LeCun, one of the pioneers of deep learning, has noted: "Getting excellent results on ImageNet is easily achieved with a convolutional net with something like 8- to 16-bit precision on the neuron states and weights." The dominance of linear algebra kernels plus short precision indicates that accelerator hardware is extremely useful in deep learning. Overall, the class of problems being addressed is that of very high-order optimization problems with very large input data sets – it is thus natural that deep learning has entered the realm of high-performance computing. Major requirements are highly scalable performance, high memory bandwidth, low power consumption, and excellent short arithmetic performance. The requisite computational resources are clusters whose nodes are populated with a sufficient number of accelerators. These provide the needed performance while keeping power consumption low. Nvidia GPUs are the most popular acceleration technology in deep learning today. Since the advent of the Pascal version of their CPU and CUDA 7.5, Nvidia has added half precision support, specifically for deep learning. With half precision or 16-bit floating point, the peak performance is double that obtained with 32-bit. In their marketing of the DGX-1 "deep learning supercomputer," Nvidia touts the higher 170 Teraflops peak rate that is based on FP16 half-precision. Other alternatives beyond GPUs are often based on ASICs and FPGAs. From Intel we have Altera FPGAs, Nervana Engines (being acquired), and Movidius VPUs (being acquired), as well as the Knights Mill (the next-generation 2017 version of Phi). From other companies, solutions include Alphabet's Google TPUs, Wave Computing DPUs, DeePhi Tech DPUs, and IBM's TrueNorth neuromorphic chips. All of these technologies have enhanced performance for reduced precision arithmetic. So like that dweeby middle school kid, machine learning is deep, wide, and short. But for it to grow, it will continue to depend on flexible HPC compute solutions – particularly accelerators – be they GPUs, FPGAs, ASICs or some other brand new chippy solution. ® Sponsored: Transforming software delivery with DevOps Tips and corrections 7 Comments More from The Register Google's machine learning app can now take over your iPhone Imagine Siri repeating 'I love Steve Jobs' forever How to steal the mind of an AI: Machine-learning models vulnerable to reverse engineering Think database enumeration attacks on steroids 44 Comments Machine-learning craze reaches freelancers: AI skills sought for gigs Fed up with artificial intelligence hype?

The manufacturer describes its new Alienware 13 R3 machines as the world’s first 13-inch laptops capable of handling VR workloads and equips them with appropriate hardware, such as quad-core Intel Core CPU, NVIDIA’s GeForce GTX 1060 GPU, high-end SSDs and the appropriate ports. To appeal to traditional gamers, Alienware also offers an optional QHD OLED display with its 13” notebooks. Dell’s boutique PC division introduced its first 13” gaming laptop, the Alienware 13, in late 2014. While the system was relatively powerful, its performance was not maxed out (a dual-core CPU, a low-end GPU, and an HDD in an entry-level configuration) and its key selling point was support for the Graphics Amplifier, an external box for video cards. The second-generation Alienware 13 released in 2015 got considerably faster graphics, but it still used dual-core CPUs, which can provide insufficient performance for come games. The manufacturer decided to improve the performance density of its third-generation compact gaming notebook significantly, which is why the Alienware 13 R3 comes with a quad-core Intel Core i5/i7 CPU and a rather powerful 16nm GPU. Moreover, the key selling point of the PC is not its eGFX support (it is still supported), but compliance with minimum requirements for VR gaming set by Oculus VR. Alienware offers four Alienware 13 R3 models based on the 45W Intel Core i5-6300HQ or the 45W Intel Core i7-6700HQ and all models will feature NVIDIA’s GeForce GTX 1060 GPU with 6 GB of GDDR5 memory. The systems come equipped with 8 or 16 GB of DDR4 SDRAM (upgradeable to 32 GB), one or two SATA or PCIe SSDs (upgradeable to 2 TB of storage), Rivet Networks' Killer 1435 802.11ac 2×2 WiFi + Bluetooth 4.1 and E2400 GbE controllers, an HD webcam with IR presence detection and so on. On the connectivity front, the Alienware 13 R3 supports Thunderbolt 3, USB-A, USB-C, mDP 1.2, HDMI 2.0 ports, 3.5 mm audio jacks as well as a Graphics Amplifier port. To further appeal to gamers, the Alienware 13 R3 has improved audio sub-systems (with larger speaker boxes), a TactX keyboard with n-key rollover and 'optimized key shape' as well as AlienFX lighting that uses fiber-optic guides.

However it's worth noting from a connectivity point of view that not everything is simple. The system only has two USB Type-A ports, whereas the Oculus VR headset needs three USB 3.0 ports and one USB 2.0 for Xbox One controller. This would suggest the need for USB hubs (or USB ports on the Graphics Amplifier — it has four of them). A note on the camera - Dell actively promotes both the use of a Windows Hello capable camera system (presumably using Intel's RealSense) as well as the integration of Tobii's eye-tracking software. Up until this implementation we had seen Tobii's eye-tracking implementation using special sensors, but it sounds as if the R13 can still do this with the Windows Hello capable system. We would imagine that it might not be as accurate, or be more computationally expensive, but it can be an interesting feature nonetheless. Up next are displays. The configurations featuring Intel Core i5 CPUs come with a TN HD (1366×768) or a touch-sensing IPS FHD (1920×1080) panel. Meanwhile, the Core i7-based laptops can boast with QHD OLED panels (2560×1440) with touch support, 400 nits brightness and 100,000:1 contrast. All Alienware 13 R3 notebooks are equipped with a 76 Wh lithium-ion battery (up from 51 Wh inside the A13 R2), but the supplier did not mention battery life of different configurations. The new Alienware 13 R3 laptops are already available in the U.S. They will hit Europe next week and China later this month. The most affordable version (Core i5-6300HQ, GeForce GTX 1060, 8 GB RAM, 180 GB SSD, HD TN display, etc.) costs $1200, whereas the premium model (Core i7-6700HQ, GeForce GTX 1060, 16 GB RAM, 512 GB PCIe SSD, QHD OLED display, etc.) is available for $2100. All configurations of the Alienware 13 R3 can be customized to better meet the needs of their owners. Moreover, since the A13 R3 laptops support external graphics (there is no word whether they support TB3-based eGFX or have to use the Graphics Amplifier exclusively), they can be upgraded over time.

POST A COMMENT 43 Comments View All Comments cknobman - Thursday, November 10, 2016 - link Tough call between this and a Razer Blade. In the end I think I would go with a similar spec'd Razer Blade. Reply RaichuPls - Thursday, November 10, 2016 - link Razer Blade is more expensive though. I think it's $2499 for the 512GB QHD+ model that isn't even full 4K? Reply Samus - Friday, November 11, 2016 - link The $1500 configuration of this is around $300 cheaper than the same configuration of the Razer Blade. And it's probably worth pointing out to those that don't know...Alienware products hold their value quite well because they are reliable and the support is good. Razer on the other hand can't even support or fix numerous issues with their products, let alone the Blade. I know a lot of people think of them as the OCZ of accessories. The Lycosa gaming keyboard is a good example why. Reply Wolfpup - Friday, November 11, 2016 - link I've had two Alienware systems so far, and both have been rock solid after years of use, and both support Nvidia's normal drivers (and the notebook which has Optimus has it OPTIONAL, so I could disable it as soon as it started causing problems in games). I really don't care how thick a notebook is or what it looks like...I want it to be well speced, well cooled, and reliable, and so far at least with the Alienware stuff I've bought it has been (not that every system they've done has been perfect, but I've lucked out so far). Reply trulyuncouth - Monday, November 14, 2016 - link I've had 3 alienwares and a VERY different experience. The only one I had no issues with was the 11.6" laptop they sold a bit back. More recently I got a 17" with the 980. It has been nothing but trouble. First the 980 only outputs through the onboard graphics making it not function at 4k60fps, even though the main graphics card is capable. The mainboard failed in it, as did the memory. I am now just outside of warranty and the damn thing stopped booting, instead beeping multiple times without the screen ever coming on. A $2000 laptop and it has been nothing but a nightmare. I will never buy an alienware again. Reply RaichuPls - Saturday, November 12, 2016 - link There's also the MSI GS43VR that's $1499 for 6700HQ, GTX 1060, 16GB RAM and 1080p IPS too. Reply Morawka - Thursday, November 10, 2016 - link no GPU, going right back to a 25w dual core cpu as well, and slower memory to boot. Reply ragenalien - Thursday, November 10, 2016 - link That's the Razer blade stealth. The Blade 14 has similar spec to this alienware. Reply Freakie - Thursday, November 10, 2016 - link If you want portability, go with the Razer Blade, at least until the Gigabyte Aero 14 comes out with it's 1060 update. If you don't mind the bulk that this Alienware has, the Gigabyte P35X v6 is a good option too. Reply Wolfpup - Friday, November 11, 2016 - link I don't see how ANY notebook is any more portable than any other notebook. I can't fit a Macbook in my pocket, it has to go in my bag, and at that point it doesn't make a bit of difference if I'm using a 2" thick 18.4" notebook or a razor thin 12" one.

Today, it announced an additional bundled title, a game-changing development in graphics rendering and developer tools that hint at a more social future for VR. The new title Oculus First Contact will be bundled with Touch controllers. These hand-circling joysticks pair with Oculus Rift so you can use your hands in virtual reality. They may call for an adjustment period, so First Contact is an entertaining orientation to all the interactions made possible by Touch. It joins other Touch-bundled titles Dead and Buried, The Unspoken, and VR Sports Challenge. Additionally, a technology called Asynchronous Spacewarp (ASW) is included in today's Oculus software update. ASW is a graphics rendering technique that is efficient enough to dramatically lower the minimum specs for gaming PCs that power the Rift experience. This should be welcome news to anyone interested in copping an Oculus Rift but has been turned off by the high cumulative price tag. ASW works by mimicking a 90 frames per second rendering speed (the benchmark for realistic VR) using half the amount of frames. That means it's possible to get the same experience on a less powerful PC, which lowers the overall minimum cost of a Rift-ready setup. New graphics and processor minimum specifications for the Rift are Nvidia 960 or greater (down from Nvidia GTX 970/AMD 290 equivalent) and Intel i3-6100/AMD FX4350 or greater (down from Intel i5-4590). Lastly, a new SDK for developers indicates that Rift users can expect an increasing amount of social game play in the future. Oculus Avatars, which launches alongside Touch on December 6, allows players to make a custom VR representation of themselves through which they can interact with others. The Avatars SDK is being released today, so more games start integrating avatars into the VR experience. Oculus Touch is available for pre-order now and ships on December 6.

TechRadar The source for Tech Buying Advice Search RSS Reviews How To Phones TVs Laptops Deals Photography More Car Tech Wearables Tablets Components Audiovisual Gaming Computing Downloads News Pro Trending MacBook Pro Nintendo Switch Google Pixel iOS 10.1 PS4 Pro Early Black Friday Deals News Best cheap phones in the US for 2016 Best cheap phones in the US for 2016 By Matt Swider Mobile phones   10 best budget iPhone and Android phones compared Shares Update: The best cheap phone of 2016 is no surprise: Motorola is once again at the top of our list. We're reviewing more budget phones than ever, so stay tuned for additional comparisons and ranking changes. The best cheap phone in the US is a complicated find. Even in 2016, carriers still love to lock you into contracts for budget phone prices, only to have you pay the full amount back in high monthly fees. That's why we have sorted through hundreds of inexpensive smartphones in order to rank the best options that you can buy unlocked without monthly fees and, importantly, without a two-year contract. And good news: while many are $200 or less, you'll actually recognize the names: Motorola, Google and Apple. Others may be new to you, namely Alcatel, ZTE and Huawei, but they're just as list worthy. No, these aren't the best phones in the US and you won't find the new Galaxy S7 or S7 Edge among them. Likewise, the new 4-inch iPhone SE is $399, so it misses the mark by $100, as lovely as it is. But every cheap phone here is perfectly fine for everyday use by someone looking to save money on a discounted iOS 10 or Android 6.0 Marshmallow handset. 1. Moto G4 The best Moto G yet Weight: 155g | Dimensions: 153 x 76.6 x 9.8mm | OS: Android 6 | Screen size: 5.5-inch | Resolution: 1080 x 1920 | CPU: Snapdragon 617 | RAM: 2GB | Storage: 16GB/32GB | Battery: 3000mAh | Rear camera: 13MP | Front camera: 5MP Bright Full HD display Impressively powerful Lack of Moto Maker options No NFC Motorola has made some major upgrades to one of its best phones you can buy right now - the Moto G. The Moto G4 is the first time the phone line has adopted a 5.5-inch Full HD display and it's an impressively powerful device as well. Compared to some of the other phones to follow on this list, this is going to give you the best gaming performance below $200. Better yet, it costs just $149 on Amazon if you're willing to put up with lockscreen ads. Battery life is impressive on the Moto G4, but it's not a perfect phone, as there's no NFC and no customization options you get with other Motorola devices. That said, the rest of the Moto G4 makes it our favorite cheap phone you can buy right now. Read the full review: Motorola Moto G4 2. iPhone 5S Apple's iPhone makes the cut if you jump through hoops Weight: 112g | Dimensions: 123.8 x 58.6 x 7.6mm | OS: iOS 10 | Screen size: 4-inch | Resolution: 640 x 1136 | CPU: Dual-core 1.3 GHz | RAM: 1GB | Storage: 16GB | Battery: 1,560mAh | Rear camera: 8MP | Front camera: 1.2MP Touch ID is easy and secure Great camera on a budget Battery could be better It's really, really difficult to fit an Apple phone on a best cheap phones list, but there has to be at least one that's inexpensive enough for iOS fans who refuse to try Android. The cheapest is iPhone 5S. Through the Apple Store, it costs $450 without a contract until the iPhone SE replaced it, and that was way too expensive to consider here. But what about outside the usual channels? The cheapest iPhone I can find comes from pre-paid carrier Virgin Mobile. It costs $249 after a $50 promotional discount, and doesn't require a contract, so you can cancel thereafter. You're only getting 16GB, but then again, so are entry-level iPhone SE owners. It comes in space gray or silver, has Touch ID and a still-impressive 8MP camera and runs iOS 10. Read the full review: iPhone 5S 3. ZTE ZMax Pro ZTE cut almost no corners on this budget device Weight: 189g | Dimensions: 165 x 84 x 8.9mm | OS: Android 6.0 | Screen size: 6-inch | Resolution: 1,920 x 1,080 | CPU: Octa-core 1.5GHz | RAM: 2GB | Storage: 32GB w/ microSD | Battery: 3,400mAh | Rear camera: 13MP | Front camera: 5MP Good build quality Close to stock Android Marshmallow Dim screen Bad speaker While ZTE might not be the world's most recognizable smartphone brand, the ZMax Pro is a sign that this might be changing soon. Somehow, this 6-inch device is just around $200 and comes packed with a fingerprint sensor, 32GB of storage, a microSD card slot, and enough power to handle medium-sized loads of gaming and multi-tasking. We think you'll be pleasantly surprised at every turn with the ZMax Pro, as we were. Currently only available for MetroPCS and T-Mobile, this device is one of the best, most-surprising values to come out of 2016. Here's to hoping that more carriers support it soon. Read the full review: ZTE ZMax Pro 4. OnePlus 2 OnePlus' excellent sophomore effort is cheaper than ever Weight: 175g | Dimensions: 151.8 x 74.9 x 9.8mm | OS: Android 6.0.1 | Screen size: 5.5-inch | Resolution: 1080 x 1920 | CPU: Snapdragon 810 Octa-core 1.8 GHz | RAM: 4GB | Storage: 64GB | Battery: 3,300mAh | Rear camera: 13MP | Front camera: 5MP Beautiful, bright display Lots of features for the price Tends to get warm No NFC, microSD or fast charging Every OnePlus device is angled to the consumer as a "flagship killer". And, although there are more powerful phones available today, the OnePlus 2 still represents a fantastic value for light users, as well as the more hardcore users. It may not have some of the niceties that we come to expect in a well-rounded device, like NFC, fast charging, or microSD support. But if you can get past those omissions, you'll be treated to what's likely the fastest, most capable smartphone on this list. Read the full review: OnePlus 2 5. Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 A cheap 5.5-inch phone from a company you've never heard of Weight: 141g | Dimensions: 152.7 x 75.1 x 7.4mm | OS: Android 6.0 | Screen size: 5.5-inch | Resolution: 1080 x 1920 | CPU: Quad-core 1.5 GHz | RAM: 2GB | Storage: 16GB | Battery: 2,910mAh | Rear camera: 13MP | Front camera: 8MP Vibrant screen Dual front stereo speakers Sluggish interface No quick charging The Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 is the best phone with a 5.5-inch display that you can get without having to pay a whole lot of money. Specifically, this Android handset is just $179. It's an unlocked phone with the same sized screen and pixel density as the iPhone 6S Plus. It even has dual, front-facing stereo speakers, something you won't hear from an Apple phone. Of course, the rest of the specs can't compare to an iPhone, with a much slower Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 octa-core processor running at 1.5GHz and mediocre 13MP camera. That should be enough for most people looking for a cheap phone. And think of it this way: you could buy four Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 phones for the price of one iPhone 7. Really. Read the full review: Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 6. Moto X 2nd generation Motorola's unlocked phone from 2014 still impresses us Weight: 144g | Dimensions: 140.8 x 72.4 x 10mm | OS: Android 6.0 | Screen size: 5.2-inch | Resolution: 1080 x 1920 | CPU: Quad-core 2.5 GHz | RAM: 2GB | Storage: 16GB | Battery: 2,300mAh | Rear camera: 13MP | Front camera: 2MP Great 5.2-inch screen Moto Maker customizations No micro SD slot Camera inconsistent Motorola's 2014 flagship is the most expensive phone on this list, but it's also one of the best because it hovers between our best phones and budget lists. It has a vibrant-looking, 5.2-inch AMOLED display and a curved back that feels like the right size and shape for a one-handed phone. The aluminum frame gives it some sharp class. It's cheaper than most Android 6.0 Marshmallow phones in its class and it has some neat tricks, like the always-on Moto Display and web-based Moto Maker software for custom phone orders. These are features carried over to the newer Moto X Style, Moto Z and Moto Z Force, but at a higher cost. There's no microSD slot, unfortunately, and the camera is okay. You'll also want to skip the nice leather option because it's a bit too supple and bruises easily. That back isn't worth your hard-earned money. Read the full review: Moto X 2nd generation 7. OnePlus X OnePlus X can now be sought without an invite code Weight: 160g | Dimensions: 140 x 69 x 6.9 mm | OS: Android 6.0 | Screen size: 5-inch | Resolution: 1080 x 1920 | CPU: Quad-core 2.3 GHz | RAM: 3GB | Storage: 16GB | Battery: 2,525mAh | Rear camera: 13MP | Front camera: 8MP Attractive design No NFC or fast charging Bright display Average performance Anyone can buy the OnePlus 3 since it doesn't require an invite, but it's still expensive at $399. Good news: its smaller sibling has been much more affordable since it launched. The OnePlus One X is now $199 and compromises on everything from inches to specs. It has a 5-inch full HD display, a Snapdragon 801 (no, not 810) processor and 3GB of RAM. Those are still better than average specs for a cheap phone that runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow. Just don't go looking for a fingerprint sensor on this budget phone option. Instead, what I appreciate most is that the phone features a microSD card slot and an older micro USB port instead of the newfangled USB-C style that I'm just not ready for yet. Read the full review: OnePlus X 8. Asus Zenfone 2 Weight: 170g | Dimensions: 152.5 x 77.2 x 10.9mm | OS: Android 6.0 | Screen size: 5.5-inch | Resolution: 1080 x 1920 | CPU: Quad-core 1.8 GHz | RAM: 2GB | Storage: 16GB | Battery: 3,000mAh | Rear camera: 13MP | Front camera: 5MP Spacious display for cheap Customization interface Cheap look and feel Dim screen and camera The more expensive 4GB ASUS Zenfone 2 was a tough sell for us, only because it brought powerful specs and Android customizations, yet wrapped it all in a plastic phone at $299. Much less of an oxymoron is the 2GB Asus Zenfone 2, at a more reasonable $199. It feels just as cheap, but for a much more appropriate price. You just have to deal with its slower processor. Intel is powering both variants, and this phone has a 1.8GHz Intel Atom Z3560 quad-core chip, ditching the more commonly used Qualcomm Snapdragon processors. Its roomy 5.5-inch display, 1080p resolution and Android software tweaks are the real highlights. Screen brightness and camera are literal lowlights, but you can't win them all with a cheap phone. We were able to test out the forthcoming Asus Zenfone 3 Deluxe (launched in Asia, but not the US just yet), but with its more powerful specs and all-metal design, it'll likely cost much more than the cheapest Zenfone 2. Read the full review: Asus Zenfone 2 9. HTC Desire 626 It's not the HTC A9, but its cheaper cousin Weight: 140g | Dimensions: 146.9 x 70.9 x 8.2mm | OS: Android 5.1 | Screen size: 5-inch | Resolution: 720 x 1280 | CPU: Octa-core 1.7 GHz | RAM: 2GB | Storage: 16GB | Battery: 2,000mAh | Rear camera: 13MP | Front camera: 5MP Bright, sharp screen Customizable interface Weak camera Average performance You won't find the new HTC 10 on this list, but the Taiwanese phone maker has a budget smartphone that packs solid mid-range specs at a fraction of the price. The year-old HTC Desire 626 holds up with a 5-inch display and 720p resolution that's big and sharp for the amount you're paying. It gives HTC's colorful interface a sharpness that makes everything pop. Its 16-megapixel (MP) camera and battery life are mediocre compared to what we were expecting, but that's almost universal on smartphones at this price. The HTC Desire 626 is all about offering an HTC-built phone with an octa-core processor, and actually paying less than the upfront price of a $199 phone that has a two-year contract.

Linux Kernel 4.8.7 Updates Intel and Radeon Drivers, Improves Wireless Support GO All users of the Linux 4.8 kernel branch must update Nov 10, 2016 18:25 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  Today, November 10, 2016, Linux kernel maintainer Greg Kroah-Hartman announced the release of the seventh maintenance update to the Linux 4.8 kernel series, along with the Linux kernel 4.4.31 LTS long-term support version. Finally, the release cycle of Linux kernel 4.8 has settled in and it looks like more and more GNU/Linux distributions are adopting it, including the upcoming openSUSE Leap 42.2 and Fedora 25, due for release next week. Rolling release users of Solus, Arch Linux, and openSUSE Tumbleweed are already enjoying the latest Linux kernel 4.8 updates, and soon they'll receive a new one, Linux kernel 4.8.7, which comes ten days after Linux kernel 4.8.6. "I'm announcing the release of the 4.8.7 kernel. All users of the 4.8 kernel series must upgrade," said Greg Kroah-Hartman. "The updated 4.8.y git tree can be found at: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git linux-4.8.y and can be browsed at the normal kernel.org git web browser: http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git;a=summary." Key highlights of Linux kernel 4.8.7 Looking at the appended shortlog and the diff from the previous point release, it looks like Linux kernel 4.8.7 is quite a big update that changes a total of 122 files, with 1096 insertions and 541 deletions. Most of the patch includes updated drivers for Intel i915 and Radeon GPUs, but also for wireless (Atheros ath10k and ath9k, as well as Realtek rtl8xxxu), PWM, I2C, MD, SCSI, SPI, virtio, USB, DAX, FireWire, TTY, and Android. Other than that, there are a few improvements to the Btrfs, NFS, OverlayFS, UBIFS, and XFS filesystems, a couple of networking stack changes to the mac80211 wireless framework and Netfilter framework for networking-related operations, and updates to the support for ARM, ARM64 (AArch64), h8300, MIPS, PA-RISC, PowerPC (PPC), s390, and x86 hardware architectures. Users are urged to update at their earliest convenience, and OS vendors to download Linux kernel 4.8.7 from kernel.org. #Linux kernel 4.8.7#Linux 4.8.7#Linux kernel#Linux#Linux 4.8 subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news You Can Now Install Maru OS 0.3 on Your Mobile Device with Magic-Device-Tool - Exclusive Atom 1.12 Hackable Text Editor Released with International Keyboard Support GoboLinux 016 Enters Beta, Gets New Kernel with Support for Generic 64-bit CPUs Rockstor 3.8-15 Linux and Btrfs-Powered Open Source NAS Solution Now Available Firefox 50.0 Officially Released for Linux, Mac and Windows, Here's What's New Some U.S. Android Phones Have Secret Backdoor That Sends Data to China Apple Insider Says iPhone 6 Plus Has a Major Bug, Company Should Start Recall Hackers Steal FIFA Currency, Buy Houses and Expensive Cars with the Money Microsoft Pledges to Completely Retire Office 2007 Next Year X.Org Server 1.19.0 Officially Released, Coming Soon to a Linux Distro Near You Red Hat Software Collections 2.3 and Red Hat Developer Toolset 6 Available Now Linux Kernel 4.4.32 LTS Adds Networking Improvements, Updated AMDGPU Drivers    Linux kernel 4.8.7 released New Linux Apps Linux Kernel: What you are about to download is the core of all the Linux operating systems in the world Linux Kernel: The core of the Linux operating systems, created and maintained by Linus Torvalds Tor Browser: Browse the web anonymously with the custom and private web browser from the Tor project KDE Frameworks: This project contains all the KDE libraries and code base for KDE applications and platform darktable: Your personal virtual lighttable and darkroom, photography workflow & RAW management application LFA (Linux For All): A 64-bit only Linux-based operating system that features four desktop environments Vivaldi: The next-generation web browser for power users, based on the powerful Chromium project Reader comments Firefox 50.0 Officially Released for Linux, Mac and Windows, Here's What's New more on: Mozilla Firefox 50.0 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

The massive computing performance of new servers equipped with GPUs calls for high network speeds, and these systems are quickly being deployed to handle machine-learning tasks, Dell’Oro Group analyst Sameh Boujelbene said. So-called HDR InfiniBand, which will be generally available next year in three sets of products from Mellanox Technologies, will double the top speed of InfiniBand. It will also have twice the top speed of Ethernet. But the high-performance crowd that’s likely to adopt this new interconnect is a small one, Boujelbene said. Look for the top 10 percent of InfiniBand users, who already use 100Gbps InfiniBand, to jump on the new stuff, she said. InfiniBand itself makes up just a small part of data-center networking. Less than five percent of all server controllers and adapters shipping these days use InfiniBand, with most of the rest using Ethernet, Boujelbene said. Intel Omni-Path, a 100Gbps interconnect that grew out of the company’s acquisition of onetime InfiniBand vendor QLogic, has an even smaller slice. One thing that sets InfiniBand apart from Ethernet is its low and predictable latency. This matters a lot in HPC, where it’s common to run simulations that have to go through many iterations. Each delay in performing an interation gets compounded thousands of times, so it needs to be minimal, said Gilad Shainer, Mellanox’s vice president of marketing. HPC systems are the most likely to have InfiniBand today. More than 200 of the huge systems on the Top500 list of supercomputers for 2016 use the interconnect. But it’s also being adopted in machine learning, big data, financial, fraud detection and other applications, Shainer said. The HDR InfiniBand product lineup has everything needed for an end-to-end 200Gbps data-center interconnect, Mellanox says. It includes Mellanox’s ConnectX-6 adapters, Quantum switches and LinkX cables and transceivers. The adapters can connect with any server CPU architecture, including x86, Power and ARM. The switch can have 40 ports of 200Gbps InfiniBand or 80 ports of 100Gbps, with a total of 16Tbps of switching capacity.

clock menu more-arrow Circuit Breaker Microsoft Tech Review Microsoft’s updated Surface Book is a big, powerful brute of a laptop The Surface Book 2 this isn’t by Dan Seifert@dcseifert Nov 10, 2016, 9:00am EST share tweet Linkedin A year ago, Microsoft set out to prove to the world that a Windows laptop could hang with the best MacBooks from Apple. The Surface Book, with its head-turning design, wild hinge technology, and detachable screen was just that laptop. Microsoft largely succeeded: though it wasn’t perfect, the Surface Book showed that a powerful, well-designed, and attractive Windows laptop was possible. A year later, the company hasn’t changed much with the Surface Book formula, not that it really had to. In fact, most of the Surface Book line is entirely unchanged: the only update is happening to the top-of-the-line model, while everything else remains the same. If you’ve been hoping for a Surface Book 2, this is not the machine you’ve been waiting for. The new, king-of-the-hill Surface Book is $100 more than last year’s model (a hefty $2,399 for 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD; $2,799 for one with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD; or an even heftier $3,299 for 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD) and has the same sixth-generation Intel Core i7 processor; same 13.5-inch "PixelSense" display with 3000 x 2000 pixels of resolution; same Surface Pen capabilities; same port selection (two USB-A 3.0 ports, an SD card slot, a DisplayPort, a headphone jack, and power); and the same capability to turn into a tablet in a pinch. Microsoft has only made two internal changes: the graphics processor has been bumped up to a Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M with 2GB GDDR5 memory and the battery has been increased in capacity to provide an estimated 16 hours of stamina, four hours more than last year's model. The updates make the Surface Book even bigger and heavier Those two changes are minor in the long list of Surface Book specs, but they forced Microsoft to adjust the base of the Surface Book to accommodate them. The new Performance Base (the one that comes with the high-end Book and houses the discrete graphics card) is thicker and heavier than last year’s, pushing the already sizeable laptop’s weight up to 3.6 pounds. The extra thickness helps to minimize — but not fully eliminate — the dreaded lint-collecting gap that forms when the laptop is closed. The Book was not the slimmest nor lightest laptop you could get, and these changes only make it more substantial — this is a beefy 13-inch laptop by any definition. I’ve been using the new Surface Book as my main machine for the past week and despite those changes, the experience is mostly the same as last year’s version. Part of that is due to my workflow — Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom are the heaviest apps I use, and they pose no challenge to this level of machine — but most of the reason the experience is the same is because Microsoft just didn’t change much. Microsoft says it increased the graphical performance of the high-end Surface Book in response to customer demands, so it might be noticeable to someone, but it’s not to me. Microsoft does not advertise the Book as a gaming machine, but its new graphics card is capable of handling some lightweight gaming. But if you’re going to spend this much money on a laptop and are a serious gamer, there are much better options available to you, including ones that have the latest chips from Nvidia and can support VR (the Surface Book cannot, at least when it comes to powering the HTC Vive or Oculus Rift). The promised battery life increase did not materialize in the real world Also missed on me is the increased battery life. In our rundown test, the Surface Book lasted 10 hours and 21 minutes, which is quite good. But in my real-world usage, browsing the web, jumping between a half-dozen apps, writing email, monitoring social feeds, etc., it struggled to last a full work day before calling it quits. Most days, the Surface Book would last between six and eight hours, which is about average for a laptop of this size. (Using the Book as a tablet worked for about two hours before it died, which is unchanged from last year.) That’s a far cry from Microsoft’s claimed 16 hours and less than my colleague Vlad Savov could get with the new 13-inch MacBook Pro. Fortunately, this Surface Book has no issues going to sleep when it’s closed and in my bag, which is a problem I’ve encountered with numerous Windows 10 laptops over the past year. Otherwise, the new Surface Book is a joy to use. The powerful processor and copious RAM let me switch between apps with ease, load dozens of tabs in my browser, and process images speedily, while never really having to wait for anything. The keyboard is wonderful to type on, and the large trackpad is the best you can get on a Windows machine. And it actually works well on my lap: I used the Surface Book numerous times on my commute without worrying that it would slide off my lap. It’s not entirely rational, and this Surface Book is certainly way more computer than I need to do my job, but I just like working on it. A USB-C port would have been a nice addition There are a couple of things I do wish Microsoft had added for this update, though. I appreciate the SD card slot and full-size USB ports, but it would have been great if Microsoft added at least one USB Type-C port, since I’m already using a phone and other accessories that rely on it. And while the hinge has been slightly modified to accommodate the larger base, it still doesn’t flex back as much as I’d like, making it awkward when using the Surface Book at a standing desk. Others might lament the fact that the processor hasn’t changed and Microsoft isn't using Intel's new Kaby Lake chips. (This is a common complaint with Apple's new MacBook Pro, as well.) Or you might not like that you can’t get more than 16GB of RAM in the new Book, even if you max out all of the specs. (This, too, is a common complaint with the new MacBook Pro.) Or you might wish that Microsoft had gone all the way up to Nvidia’s GTX 1060 graphics card, like Razer did with its new Blade. (Also a frequently cited complaint with the MacBook Pro.) If you were hoping that this new Surface Book would be a complete overhaul, you’ll have to keep waiting. It is quite truly a midlife cycle spec refresh and nothing more. Most people will probably be just fine with one of the less expensive Surface Books, which haven’t been updated, but if you want to pony up to the top of the line, that top is slightly higher than before. Still the king of the Windows hill The question now is do you plunk down $3,000 for this ultimate Surface Book, or do you wait for the inevitable Surface Book 2 that will likely come next year? If you have a Surface Book already, it doesn’t make much sense to upgrade this soon into its lifespan. And there is certainly a good argument to be made to wait for the Microsoft’s next revision, which will likely have Intel’s seventh-generation processor. But if you can’t wait, and you’re looking for the ultimate Windows laptop, it’s hard to look past Microsoft’s latest Surface Book. Correction, 11:10 AM ET, November 10th, 2016: An earlier version of this review mistakenly referred to the Surface Book's processor as quad-core. It's a dual-core processor. The error has been corrected. Photography by Amelia Krales.

-- Mobile Experts has released a new case study on 5G Ultra-Broadband that explores the future Return on Investment (ROI) for Fixed-Broadband 5G Networks. The study calculates the potential ROI for a mobile operator to invest in a 28 GHz pre-5G network by comparing to LTE costs and potential costs for a sub-6 GHz network using 5G technology. Photo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161109/437678 Why Pre-5G Deployment Will be Highly Targeted The 23-page study identifies three main factors that analyze spectrum cost, link distance, and traffic density. At historical prices, 5G will not be successful. According to Mobile Experts, inexpensive access is absolutely necessary to large spectrum blocks. "The business case for 5G Fixed Broadband is not a slam-dunk," commented Principal Analyst Joe Madden. "We expect pre-5G deployment to be a very targeted investment by mobile operators, addressing very specific neighborhoods instead of nationwide deployment." Short mm-wave links at 50 meters create a challenge to the business case, because the number of customers served by each radio will be too small. Mobile Experts determines that longer links, roughly 200 meters, will be necessary to reach more people. "Link Distance is a key factor in the pre-5G business case at 28 GHz.   We've conducted some in-depth link budget calculations and compared our results to trial results reported by Samsung, Ericsson, Intel, and others.   Based on this deep technical work, we have some concerns about the power, linearity, and heat dissipation in pre-5G infrastructure. The laws of physics will limit these pre-5G networks." The case study's assumptions are also laid out in detail for a hypothetical test case, with an Appendix indicating the calculation itself for complete disclosure. Mobile Experts concludes that Fixed Broadband at 28 GHz will be a starting point for 5G development, but a combination of low-band and high-band spectrum will be important to reach mobile gigabit performance.

Why do I, as CEO of a Boston-based company which looks to commercialise the most exciting discoveries spinning out of leading American universities and government institutions shuttle across the Atlantic to tell our story to British and other European investors? What do we get out of being a FTSE250 company when we could trade on Nasdaq, the market so many regard as the natural venue for the biggest beasts of disruptive technology? For Allied Minds, the answer is that we chose London because it is largely UK investors who understand our model. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Chris Silva, chief executive of Allied Minds Indeed the case for our London listing in June 2014 was overwhelming because our biggest shareholders, such as Woodford Investment Management and Invesco Perpetual, were already UK based. Typically, there’s a very different mindset in the US where venture investors only really start to become interested after the startup is created and is well down the track to selling its products or services. By contrast, Allied Minds, and to some extent our UK-focused peers such as IP Group and Imperial Innovations, are involved in identifying the most promising opportunities at inception, at the eureka moment in the laboratory of academic and government research institutions. In our case, once we have identified a prospect, we invest and set up the business as a majority owned subsidiary company. The halo effect of this growing sector has not been lost on the London Stock Exchange as it steps up efforts to win technology IPOs in competition with global rivals. Yet the LSE has yet to showcase London’s success in the IP commercialisation field which perhaps represents one of its greatest strengths in reinforcing the UK market as a world leader in disruptive technology. Given the ferocity of competition across exchanges for high growth listings, it must be wholly in the interests of the LSE to build its lead in this sector. And beyond the LSE, it falls to all of us with an interest in this London success story to do more to explain the bigger picture behind IP commercialisation. For this is a gateway to bring to market the most exciting research breakthroughs across high technology and life sciences. At Allied Minds, we single out technologies which will disrupt existing large and growing markets and business models. It’s a gruelling process, sifting through thousands of prospects annually from our relationships with more than 160 top American universities, the Department of Defense and other US government agencies. This has led to the formation of several key subsidiaries capable of transforming their target markets, whether they are combating cancer or blindness, bringing the shared economy model to mobile phone spectrum, or pioneering a new form of digital memory. Any of these may have the potential to disrupt the status quo of multibillion-dollar industries. And we’re making strides to move to commercialisation by partnering up with some of the biggest and most successful players in their particular sector, names such as Bristol-Myers Squibb, Google, Intel and GE Ventures. To me, that’s a powerful validation of the potential of this business model. And it’s is a model which continues to build in the London market. At the LSE, we’re seeing a virtuous circle where the faster the exchange attracts new listings in this sector, the more attractive it becomes to potential issuers. We’re not the only US-based IP commercialisation company listed on the LSE. We’ve been joined by PureTech Health. More will follow. Conversely, UK-based peers such as IP Group, which have hitherto concentrated on British research, are now looking to forge links with US academia and research institutes. No surprise, perhaps, when you consider the scale of the US R&D spend relative to the UK. Given the breadth and depth of our relationships across US academia and federal institutions, we have no problem with competition. It’s a healthy evolution of our sector. We’re very happy with our London listing. Yet markets ceaselessly evolve. There are signs that knowledgeable US and Asian investors are becoming more comfortable with this investment model. The UK is a leader here. And let’s hope the LSE keeps at the top of this game. You can’t overestimate the importance of these disruptive technologies being readied for commercialisation. Not just for investors. But in terms of improving lives and beating diseases, for the good of society too.

Or do you want to wipe a drive in a computer that you are selling or giving away? Here are some tips and tricks to help you get the job done. By Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0 | October 31, 2016 -- 15:32 GMT (08:32 PDT) | Topic: Hardware What's Hot on ZDNet Why Samsung's Harman purchase will be seen as Apple blunder decades from now Nintendo announces release date for Super Mario Run on iOS Why automation is finally revolutionizing quick service restaurants and what it means for jobs Major Linux security hole gapes open Got a pile of old drives that you need to wipe before sending them to Silicon Heaven? Or do you want to wipe a drive in a computer that you are selling or giving away? Here are some tips and tricks to help you get the job done. Since hard drives (HDDs) and solid state drives (SSDs) need different handling, I'm going to cover them separately here. See also: Apple has been outsmarted by Microsoft HDDs There are three approaches you can take to securely wiping hard drives. Software The cheapest way to tackle a pile of hard drives is to wipe them with a software eraser. I warn you though, it's not quick, and it won't work on defective disks. My tool of choice for wiping drives is Darik's Boot And Nuke. It's free and does an excellent job of wiping drives clean. To use it, you'll need to create a wipe CD or DVD, then hook up the drives you want to wipe to a PC, and run the software. Be careful not to inadvertently wipe a drive containing data you need, because that will make your life suck. I suggest using a spare PC or, failing that, disconnecting all the data drives from the system you use, just in case. You can do this since you'll be booting up off the Boot And Nuke disc and not the internal drive. I recommend that you read and thoroughly familiarize yourself with the documentation for this software, because if you take your eye off the ball and wipe the wrong drive, your data is gone. Hardware If you don't feel like taking the software approach, another method you can take is to employ a bespoke hardware tool to do the job. At this point though things start to get a little expensive, but it is faster and does mean that you don't have to dedicate a PC to the wiping operation. The tool I use is Wiebetech's Drive eRazer Ultra . It's a fast, reliable, standalone solution to wiping hard drives. You hook the drive up to it, tap a few buttons, and Drive eRazer Ultra takes care of the rest. I've used this tool to wipe dozens of drives with great success. It's an expensive solution for sure -- the eRazer Ultra starts at $200 -- but if you have a lot of drives to wipe, it's well worth it. The hands-on method Tech Pro Research Six business-class cloud storage services at a glance Toolkit: Calculating tape backup needs Storage Troubleshooting Flowchart OK, what do you do if you want to wipe drives that have died or become defective in some way with data still on them that now cannot be wiped? You could take a chance that since the drive is dead, the data is gone, but you got to plan on the drive falling into the hands of someone cleverer than you (or someone who has more time and patience). Here's where the hands-on method comes into play. This method also works great if you just want to destroy drives before you take them to the recycling plant. You will need: A hammer (I use my trusty 32oz "fine adjustment" hammer) A thick nail (a 6-inch nail will do fine) Thick gloves -- because you're going to be hammering that nail through the drive using the hammer, and hammers are magnetically attracted to thumbs A block of wood -- so you don't nail the drive to your floor (it's preferable to do this outside if you can) Eye protection -- you've only got a maximum of two to start with, so it's silly to take chances! Now you apply brute force. Ideally you want to put a nail through the platters of the drive, going all the way through (it's actually not as hard as it sounds). I aim for the spot marked by the red X: By aiming for this spot, you not only smash the platters holding the data, but you also mangle the read/write heads. If you're really paranoid, put a nail through the green stars, which will put more holes in the platters. This is a very effective method of destroying drives, and it's also a lot of fun, not to mention a great way to relieve stress! SSDs This is where things can get very complicated, and I could write reams about TRIM commands and garbage collection and so on. The problem is things get convoluted, which is when mistakes happen and your precious baby pictures or work project gets deleted. With that in mind, I'm going to keep things simple. Erase using manufacturer utilities One way to erase SSDs is to use the manufacturer utilities. Here are some links to get you started. Intel Solid State Toolbox Corsair SSD Toolbox SanDisk SSD Toolbox Samsung Magician Software OCZ Toolbox If you have a drive from a different source, go check out their website. Encrypt the whole drive One of the easiest ways is to encrypt the entire drive with a complex passphrase. On Windows, you can use something like VeraCrypt, while on Mac, you can use the built-in FileVault utility, and you're done. No passphrase, no data. You can then format the drive, from which point it should be sterile and ready to accept a reload of the data. PARTED Magic Another way to do this is to use a software tool called PARTED Magic. Rather than tell you how to use this, here's a video showing it in action. While PARTED Magic is not free (price starts at a reasonable $9), it is a very effective tool, and one of the best I've used for wiping SSDs. The hands-on method If the drive is dead, or you just want to get rid of it in a hurry and don't want a functioning drive at the end of it, then you can take a hammer to the SSD. One thing to bear in mind is that the data in SSDs in held on small flash storage chips rather than large platters, and to securely erase the data, you need to smash the chips. Usually, this means taking the cover off the drive before you start swinging. If you're not sure which are the flash storage chips, just drive a nail through all the large chips just to be on the safe side. A dozen, faster, better or cheaper alternatives...

TrustedReviews Facebook Twitter Googleplus TVs & Audio Cameras Computing Mobile Home appliances Gaming Competitions GPS & Sat Nav Mobile Apps Mobile Phone Accessories Mobile Phones Tablets Wearables & Fitness Trending: iOS 10 Apple Watch 2 iPhone 7 Galaxy S7 vs iPhone 6S Google Pixel Galaxy S7 Home / News / Mobile Phone News / Samsung’s latest ploy could make future Galaxy smartphones cheaper Samsung’s latest ploy could make future Galaxy smartphones cheaper by Sean Keach 10 November 2016 0 shares Read Comments In its war against Apple et al, Samsung is dragging the production of more and more smartphone components under its own banner. Samsung has been developing fingerprint sensor chips since last year, with a view to begin manufacturing the new tech in 2017. That’s according to a new report from ETNews, a news outlet based in Samsung’s home of South Korea. The chips are reportedly being created by Samsung’s System LSI business, which builds components destined for electronic devices. Of course, we can’t verify this information, so take it with due caution. It’s the latest news in what appears to be a series of Samsung efforts to keep third-party suppliers at arm’s length. The most notable example in recent times was Samsung’s decision to start using its own custom-built Exynos processors in the flagship Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S7 smartphones, rather than solely relying on market leading chip maker Qualcomm. But Samsung also manufactures its own displays, batteries, and other vital smartphone components that give it a leg up over rivals. Apple has made similar moves, recently opting to include Intel-built modems in the iPhone 7, rather than relying on Qualcomm modems, as it has historically done. Samsung currently sources its fingerprint sensors from Synaptics, a market giant that shares industry dominance with Sweden’s FPC. If Samsung can build its own chips, it will mean future Galaxy smartphones could cost less to produce – although there’s no guarantee that this saving would be passed onto you, the consumer. But Samsung is also likely to sell its wares to other third-parties, giving the giant an additional revenue stream in case the corporate giant’s mobile business turns sour, as it did with the recently recalled Galaxy Note 7. We’ve asked Samsung for comment, and will update this article with any response.

Here's all you need to know about these popular leaders who have made political history with their win. 1. Kamala Harris [caption id="attachment_74528" align="aligncenter" width="920"] Kamala Harris[/caption] View photos kamala-harris1More Photo Source The 52-year-old Kamala Harris is a lawyer by profession who has been twice elected as Attorney General, in 2010 and 2014. Harris, who traces her family roots to Chennai through her Indian mother, is also counted as an African American due to her Jamaican father. Other than the first Indian-American senator, this also makes her the second American woman of African descent elected to the Senate. A protege of President Obama, who has called her brilliant, tough and fearless, Harris is expected to be a fierce advocate of the India-US relationship. Harris was born on October 20, 1964, in Oakland, California. Her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, came to the US from India to study science, specifically endocrinology and complex mechanisms of cancer. Her father,Donald Harris, grew up in Jamaica, where he became a national scholar and earned the opportunity to study economics at Stanford University. Having grown up in San Francisco's Bay Area, Harris earned a Law Degree from Hastings College of the Law. Following that accomplishment, Harris proceeded to leave her mark on the legal arena of San Francisco. In 2003, she made history by being elected as the San Francisco district attorney, becoming the first woman, black and South Asian to achieve this feat. In November 2007, voters reelected her to the office. A civil rights activist involved in immigrant and women's rights causes, Kamala Harris announced her bid for the US Senate in January 2015. 2.

After completing her education, she worked on Wall Street as a financial analyst and went on to earn a Master of Business Administration from Northwestern University. After working in the medical equipment industry for a year, she found her passion in the social justice arena. Before coming to the Legislature, Jaypal worked for two decades both internationally and domestically as a leading national advocate for women’s, immigrant’s, civil and human rights. The first bill Jaypal introduced in the Washington State Senate was a proposal to raise the minimum wage. She has since championed a number of other significant pieces of legislation, including tuition-free community college, measures to help survivors of sexual assault get justice, as well as many other key issues, She also led one of the largest voter registration efforts in Washington state, helping over 23,000 new Americans to register to vote. She is also the founder of OneAmerica, Washington state’s largest immigrant and refugee advocacy organization. In May 2013, Jaypal was recognized as a White House "Champion of Change".

With this collaboration between TSSC, IESA and TiE, the CoE will help provide a platform to skill, develop and train blue-collar workers in the field of IoT. Naganand Doraswamy, president, TiE Bangalore stressed about the need for such initiatives. He said, “Both TiE and IESA are proud to present the second edition of IoTNext. With aggressive focus by the Indian Government on ‘Digital India’, ‘Smart Cities’ and ‘Make in India’ to drive the growth and development of the nation, the MoU signed today will provide further impetus for the growth of the IoT ecosystem. With the rise in technological innovations, many workers lose out on opportunities as there is a huge gap between their skills and what is expected of them. The Center of Excellence will provide them with these necessary skills and bridge the gap.” As the industry shifts towards automation, it will help empower the group to focus on gaining competency using some of the best practices and also help create job opportunities. This is on the heels of the second IoTNext 2016 event that saw a huge turnout from industry thought leaders, startups and stakeholders in the IoT sector. IoTNext has mentored around 16 startups since its inception including Cardiac Design Labs that won Google LaunchPad Award. The growth of IoT in every industry has led to the need to train technicians in order to deploy, manage and maintain the IoT edge Nodes and Gateways. At the summit, TiE-IESA has also launched a unique IoT Startup directory, a compilation of IoT startups across the nation. It will be an online repository with detailed information on the startups and the products they offer. TiE- IESA has also teamed up with HAX Accelerator to support Indian startups. Speaking on the occasion, M N Vidyashankar, president, IESA said, “It is our great pleasure to bring forth IoTNext again this year.

The company said it is recalling all of the approximately 2,500 Karma drones it has sold due to instances when power cut out during flight. “Safety is our top priority,” GoPro founder and chief executive Nicholas Woodman said in a release announcing the recall yesterday. “A very small number of Karma owners have reported incidents of power failure during operation.” GoPro shares plunged more than nine percent to USD 9.88 in after-market trades following the announcement. The company complete refunds, saying it is coordinating the recall with the US Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Federal Aviation Administration. The drones were priced at USD 799. There have been no reports of injuries or property damage from the power loss, GoPro said. “We are very sorry to have inconvenienced our customers and we are taking every step to make the return and refund process as easy as possible,” Woodman said. GoPro introduced its highly anticipated drone in the hope of lifting profits battered by competition from all sides. The launch of the Karma drone, tailored for its first-person-action mini-cameras, came with the debut of improved Hero5 cameras that ran into a production problem blamed for hampering opening sales. The drones boast simple joystick and touch-screen controls, and fold easily into a padded backpack that is provided. An image-stabilising grip in the drone is designed to hold Hero cameras, which are not included in the backpack. GoPro’s Karma trouble comes as the California-based company strives to distinguish itself in an increasingly competitive market for mini-cameras that can be used to capture adventures or sports from personal perspectives. Read- Intel unveils ‘Shooting Star’: A drone designed for aerial light shows GoPro became an early hit with extreme sports enthusiasts who used the mini-cameras to film their exploits, and went on to win over teens and young adults interested in sharing videos on YouTube and social networks. The company went public in June 2014 with shares initially priced at USD 24 that soared in subsequent months, more than tripling in value at one point. But the stock price slid last year as investors worried about the company’s growth prospects and the possible saturation of an increasingly competitive market.

X Era of the drone-delivered pizza is at hand Ireland grapples with the commercial advantages of deregulating air space Thu, Nov 10, 2016, 05:00 Mark Hilliard Capt. Julie Garland, chairperson, Unmanned Aircraft Association of Ireland, Paschal O’Donohoe, Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and Ralph James, Director of Safety Regulation, Irish Aviation Authority at the inaugural UAAI Open Day ‘Meet the Drones’at Weston Airport, Lucan. Photograph: Alan Betson / The Irish Times A quadcopter drone arrives with a small delivery at Deutsche Post headquarters in Bonn. The company is testing deliveries of medicine by drone over short distances. Photograph: Andreas Rentz/Getty Images The so-called Prime Air unmanned aircraft project that Amazon is working on in its research and development labs. Photograph: AP/Amazon Previous Image Next Image         In September, 1945 one and a half million New Yorkers got an impromptu day off thanks to striking elevator operators. The industrial action over pay and working hours put the higher floors of more than 2,000 skyscrapers out of reach. With the Manhattan business community paralysed, the strike would later spread to apartment buildings; fire crews and policemen were drafted in; mail went undelivered and overburdened phone systems bent under the strain. Something had to change. “When elevators were invented they were kind of terrifying,” Steven Henn, a correspondent on NPR radio in America, said 70 years later during a recent retrospective on attitudes towards changing technology. “I mean, think about it. You’re hanging hundreds of feet in the air by a cable. And elevator operators in those days guided the cars to level stops by hand.” The strikes, and their ability to inflict maximum disruption on high-rise cities, at least contributed to the creation of the “driverless elevator”, something that required a shift in consumer thinking and a PR campaign endorsing the safety of vertiginous technology. Although Henn described this development as the driverless Google car of its time, many in the drone industry also see something familiar. Sometime within the next decade, they insist, unmanned airborne machines will swoop freely overhead delivering anything from medical supplies to pizza. The evolution of drone technology is inevitable even if it is the 21st century alternative to being hoisted 60 storeys in an unmanned box. But if people today are edgy at the prospect of drones occupying the skies, imagine how the regulators must feel – those ultimately responsible for people’s safety and wellbeing. Somewhere though, something has to change. “Ireland has always been fairly open and flexible about good policy for drones,” says Philip McNamara, creator of the Drones Data X Conference which switches biannually between Ireland and the US (it was in Dublin this month). ADVERTISEMENT Natural fit McNamara admires that Ireland was among the pioneers of commercial licensing systems. He sees it as an indicator the country wants to stay ahead of the curve. “Ireland has wanted to be a leader in Europe and in the world because of what the IDA is pushing [in terms of foreign investment] and because there are so many companies around,” he says. It seems like a natural fit. Ireland has already grabbed the tech sector by the throat, offering various incentives to make the western European, English- speaking island its home. It is an approach that could be reproduced for the drone sector and, behind the scenes, tentative steps are being taken. “Someone has to learn to fly in the rain and the wet and Ireland would be great,” says McNamara. “The biggest challenge is night flying and going beyond the line of sight. If Ireland allowed these two situations it would make it a lot more attractive to companies.” The complexities of “beyond line of sight” flying are among the more obstructive to the development of a commercial sector that could aspire to create thousands of direct and indirect jobs (particularly in drone-related software). The Irish Aviation Authority’s Small Unmanned Aircraft (Drones) and Rockets Order, 2015 says users “shall not allow such an aircraft to be flown, unless otherwise permitted by the Authority . . . beyond direct unaided visual line of sight and not farther than 300 metres from the point of operation”. “I think that will be overcome very quickly with good software and navigation systems. I think it’s about getting people to think: yes, this is safe,” McNamara says. “The first step is to create that zone where every company can test in that five- mile block. Once people are happy with that, it can expand.” While the regulation rules out any kind of distance-delivery applications, it is not entirely binding and depends what a company seeks to do. While drone regulation will ultimately be driven by EASA (the European Aviation Safety Agency), for now it is the preserve of individual regulators. Donegal Mountain Rescue finds drones a speedy and safe aid Drone technology could make mountain searches much quicker Amazon delivery Speed is essential. Industry figures agree that procrastination could hand the initiative to others. Last July, Amazon hailed the UK as a “world leader in enabling drone innovation” after reaching agreement with the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to bend a number of restrictive rules. This will be crucial to realising the company’s aspiration of delivering small packages to online customers via its Prime Air drones which are capable, so far, of distances of up to 10 miles. Critically, the CAA allowed the company go beyond line of sight as well as using one controller to fly multiple drones. The company also plans to test its “sense and avoid” technology which will be a fundamental of future commercial flight. The restrictive nature of US regulations, and the pragmatism of the UK’s, made the move possible. Similar things are likely to happen in Ireland and speculative overtures have already been made. Earlier this year, The Irish Times revealed an unpublished consultation document produced by Mayo County Council hoping to lure potentially lucrative drone investment. “Global technology companies such as Google, Amazon and Facebook have taken a clear interest in drone technology,” it noted. “These companies are interested in drones to facilitate mass communications in regions that remain ‘offline’ and deliver e-commerce purchases to customers via drone. “Attracting high-tech companies to Co Mayo is key to creating the jobs of the future.” This, however, is the role of IDA Ireland. It declined to comment other than to say the sector is expanding rapidly and it “will continue to talk to potential investors about the benefits of locating their businesses here”. ADVERTISEMENT Chief concern Enterprise Ireland, working with indigenous companies, is currently supporting a small number of ventures. There are of course other considerations for attracting the drone industry to Ireland. McNamara mentions the need for an appealing tax climate and development of partnerships with Silicon Valley. But ultimately, the role of testing technology – and overcoming public and regulatory prudence – is today’s chief concern. One company that has engaged tentatively with Ireland is the start-up Flirtey. Last March it completed the first regulator-approved drone delivery in the US – a package consisting of bottled water, food and a first aid kit buzzed its way to an address in an uninhabited residential area of Nevada; an auspicious harbinger of what could be happening in housing estates all over the US within a matter of years. “What has been preventing a commercial drone delivery industry emerging is the reluctance of aviation regulators around the world to green-light it,” Flirtey founder Matthew Sweeny told Austalia Unlimited. “And that’s in part related to a lingering suspicion around drones among the general public and their elected representatives.” Nevertheless, investment continues apace; the future has been mapped out. Financing in the US alone, according to McNamara, has gone from $1 million at the end of 2011 to more than $100 million in mid 2015. Companies with an active interest include Amazon, Google, Facebook, Intel, Nasa, Uber and DHL. Ireland has signalled its intentions by being among the leaders of regulation. The IAA’s 2015 rules govern the use of drones but are largely tailored towards the growing hobby sector (6,000 units have so far been registered since it became mandatory last year and that number is expected to swell on the back of Christmas sales). The rules are clear and designed to police public safety. It seems to have worked well so far, with no major incidents to speak of. But the IAA is pragmatic and there is room in its rule book for manoeuvre. “Regulation is not there to stop people doing things. Regulation, as we employ it, is there to ensure that whatever is done is done safely,” says Ralph James, IAA director of safety regulation. An experienced pilot and former head of the Irish Air Corps, James brings an encyclopaedic knowledge of safety mixed with a keen sense of opportunity and, crucially, the importance of opportunity. The IAA can only be concerned with safety, as its central function, but there are ways to regulate for innovation. “Various people have come and had conversations with us. I have explained to them . . . that we are open for business. We are not regulating them out of business, quite the reverse,” says James. “We see regulation as being in support of business but protecting, obviously, Ireland from a safety perspective. That is our remit.” Tellingly, though, James explains that no company has asked them about breaking line-of-sight operations. If they did, through the commercial licence process, they would sit down and listen. A company would be required to file risk assessment complete with risk mitigation – typically including the level of training, the failure rate of specific equipment and insurance cover. If satisfactory, James says, “we will give you a small area, let’s try it. We sit in on the test, we look at the results of the test and we develop it. It’s regulation based on risk assessment and performance.” This apparent receptiveness has yet to be tested but it appears as if Ireland’s skies are open to foreign direct investment. Shark patrols Future potential, notes James, is limited only by imagination. But there is another hurdle to the sector developing tomorrow’s world. ADVERTISEMENT “It needs to win the hearts and minds of people,” says James, who agrees the era of drone ubiquity is at hand. He lists off examples of the kind of drone innovations that might start and win the PR war. An experiment in Rwanda bringing medical supplies to a remote area. Airborne shark patrols in Australia. “It doesn’t have to be pizza,” he says. “They are running tests in the Middle East in terms of life-saving. Drones flying up and down the beach permanently, with life jackets underneath them. And any time they have run a test the drones have beaten the lifeguards.” Companies looking to integrate drones into day-to-day life need not only convince the lawmakers. Advertising the benefits and easing the concerns of the public are a key piece of the puzzle. It’s a bit like the arrival of unmanned elevators. Adverts showed children pushing the buttons and grandmothers safely riding the cars. There was, noted the NPR programme, soothing music and big red safety buttons. When the people were convinced it was safe and beneficial to do so, they rode the elevators to great heights. In no time, they were accepted as part of urban reality. “The drone industry now, I think, has got to turn around and bring people onboard,” says James. “It has to create the atmosphere where people accept that drones are going to be part of our life.”       Topics: Matthew Sweeny Philip Mcnamara Ralph James Steven Henn Civil Aviation Authority Enterprise Ireland European Aviation Safety Agency IDA Ireland Irish Aviation Authority Nasa Amazon DHL Facebook Flirtey Google Intel Uber Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Transport & Tourism Easyjet may apply for Irish licence to ensure EU access Personal Finance The bond rout and Irish pension savers: what you need to be aware of International Gordon D’Arcy: All Blacks will be bitter, Ireland must be better Business Sensors help police curb gang violence in Cape Town Sponsored World-first tech restores mains electricity to Aran Islands Newbridge Silverware builds ambitious plan for US market My Jaguar F-Pace: ‘I was completely blown away’ Ten things to consider when buying a new sofa ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Commenting on The Irish Times has changed.

Reuters/Lucas Jackson Within a few days from each other, Microsoft and Apple released the next generation in their successful line of notebooks -- the Surface Book 2 and the 2016 MacBook Pro respectively. Both devices offer unique features, such as a detachable screen and an option Touch Bar, but also hold their own when stripped down to their essentials. READ: Microsoft Surface Phone 2017 release date, news & update: Redmond tech giant looking to consolidate Windows 10 platform The Microsoft Surface Book 2 Technically called the Surface Book i7, the Surface Book 2 is powered by the sixth generation Intel Core i7 processor. And as Microsoft has partnered this with a Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M GPU, it is one of the most powerful non-gaming laptops that also offers stellar graphics. To handle this, however, the device experienced a redesign from the inside and weighs a relatively heavier 3.63 pounds. The Surface Book 2 sports a 13.5 inch screen, which boast a display of 3000 x 2000 pixel resolution. The device has two full-sized USB 3.0 ports, as well as a full-sized SD card reader. Microsoft claimed a 16-hour battery life, but C|Net clocked it in at just over 11.5 hours. The Surface Book i7 is already available for pre-order and is priced at US$2,399 (AU$3,130). Watch the Surface Book i7 introduction READ: Microsoft Surface Pro 5 release date, news & update: Specs, features & price discussed; Early 2017 release expected The 2016 MacBook Pro Before the 2016 MacBook Pro was officially announced, the public was itching for a Mac upgrade, and Apple delivered in terms of power. The new generation is powered by Intel’s sixth generation Core i5 processors, which Apple confirmed are configurable to the Core i7 processors. The device also sports an Intel Iris Graphics 540 chip for the standard 13 inch variant and an Intel Iris Graphics 550 chip for the 13 inch model with TouchBar. The 2016 MacBook Pro display boasts a 2560 x 1600 pixel resolution with a LED-backlit display and IPS technology. The device also sports two Thunderbolt 3 ports and weighs in at just over 3 pounds. Its battery life is also better than its predecessor with 10 hours of continuous web use. The lowest-end version of the device is available for pre-order for US$1499 (AU$1,960), while the highest-end variant is priced at US$2,399 (AU$3,130).

The 802.11ad standard has been given the catchier moniker of WiGig. It enables data speeds as fast as 8 Gigabits per second (Gbps) over short range, according to AnandTech. WiGig operates at the extremely high frequency of 60 GHz, which makes it impossible for signals to penetrate walls and other objects. This means that there must be a line of sight between participants. It therefore is optimized, the story says, for “wireless docking stations, wireless AR/VR head-mounted displays, wireless high-performance storage devices, wireless displays” and other bandwidth-hungry devices. It will be big. ABI Research released research today that suggests 2017 will be a critical year for WiGig as it penetrates the home market. The firm forecasts that more than 1 billion WiGig chipsets will ship in 2021. The key players will be Broadcom, Intel, Lattice Semiconductor, MediaTek, Nitero, Peraso and Qualcomm. The firm also said that it expects 28 percent of smartphones to be “triband,” with 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz and 60 GHz capabilities. It will be useful in the drive to make computing truly cable-free and, because of the tremendous amount of bandwidth it offers, will help push artificial reality/virtual reality. The short range of WiGig seems, on first glance, to be a severe limitation. It does indeed constrain its use case. At the same time, WiGig adds value in unexpected ways, according to CNET’s Stephen Shankland: The limits of 60GHz radio come with a silver lining. WiGig sends data in highly directional beams instead of bathing a room in radio, an approach that limits interference and lets multiple devices work at top speeds. Also, WiGig signals fade fast. That means you needn't worry if your upstairs neighbor watches 8 hours of streaming video every night. Today's Wi-Fi passes through walls and floors, so a busy neighbor can cause interference on your own network. The master planners who are mapping the march of 802.11 are very savvy. They continually push the speed/distance envelope, of course. But it is important to make the technology more pliable and useful in other ways, as well. WiGig is an initiative that seems poised to do just that. Carl Weinschenk covers telecom for IT Business Edge.

Indian-American women put up a good show in the 2016 elections, with Kamala Harris, 51, a two-term attorney general from California, creating history by winning the US Senate seat from the state. Pramila Jayapal, 51, won the Congressional seat from Seattle to enter the House of Representatives, the first Indian-American woman to accomplish this feat. Jayapal would be joined in the House of Representatives by Raja Krishnamoorthi, who made it to the highest citadel of democracy in their second attempt. Ro Khanna, the democratic candidate from California’s 17th District, defeated his party colleague Mike Honda by nearly 19 percentage points. Meanwhile, Democratic Congressman Ami Bera’s election results have gone for recounting. Bera was contesting against Republican Scott Jones for the House of Representatives. “I have full confidence that the professionals who work at the Sacramento County Registrar will ensure that every ballot is counted, and right now we need to let them do their job,” said Bera. “As the first votes were counted on Election Day, I had the greatest lead I've ever had at this stage, so I’m confident that we're again headed toward victory. After months of a divisive national election, our job starting tomorrow is to bring our country back together,” he said. In 2012, and again in 2014, Bera's race was too close to call on election night. In both years, Bera emerged as the winner -- in 2012 by a margin of 9,191, and in 2014 by a margin of 1,455 votes -- after the Sacramento County Registrar of Voters counted these provisional and vote by mail ballots. If re-elected for the third term, Bera would equal the record of Dalip Singh Saund, who was elected to the House of Representatives from the 29th Congressional District of California from January 1957 to January 1963. Jindal, who later went on to become the two-term Governor of Louisiana, was elected to the US House of Representatives twice in 2004 and 2006. Outgoing US President Barack Obama had endorsed Harris, Krishnamoorthi and Bera. Senator Bernie Sanders and former US President Jimmy Carter had endorsed Jayapal. Harris, who was born in Oakland, California, is the daughter of an Indian mother who emigrated from Chennai in 1960 and a Jamaican American father. California Democrats had overwhelmingly endorsed Harris for US Senate, solidifying her front-runner status in the race to become California’s next senator. Endorsing Harris, Obama had said "Kamala Harris fights for us. That’s why I am so proud to endorse her for United States Senator. And if you send her to the Senate, she'll be a fearless fighter for the people of California, all the people of California, every single day." Jayapal entered the US Congress in her maiden attempt. Born in Chennai, she left India at the age of five for Indonesia, Singapore and eventually for the US. Jayapal says her life transformed for the better after she spent some time in India when she returned to the country after a gap of 25 years in April 1995. Her book -- Pilgrimage to India: A Woman Revisits Her Homeland -- was published in 2000. In the primaries, early this summer, Khanna had received more votes than eight-term incumbent Honda. California electoral system allows the top two winners of the primaries to proceed to the general polls, even if they are from the same party. Khanna, 40, had narrowly lost to Honda in 2014 Congressional polls. A Yale law graduate and a former official of the Obama administration, Khanna was pitted against his own party’s Honda to represent the 17th Congressional district of California, whose residents stretch from Tesla Motors factory in Fremont to Apple's headquarters in Cupertino -- taking in Intel, Yahoo, and eBay along the way. Krishnamoorthi, 42, was contesting for the 8th Congressional District of Illinois that includes west and northwest Chicago suburbs. A son of immigrants, Krishnamoorthi grew up in Illinois and after college and law school, he became policy advisor for Obama’s successful US Senate campaign. He also served as a founding prosecutor in Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan’s anti-corruption unit. In an endorsement in June, Obama had said as the son of immigrants who worked their way into the middle-class, Krishnamoorthi understands both the challenges facing America’s working families and the opportunities their work makes possible. “I know he'll fight hard in Congress to create more good jobs, empower more Americans to start businesses, and help working families afford to put their children through college,” Obama had said. Two Indian-Americans in fray from New Jersey and Michigan however lost their bid to enter the US Congress. Democratic Party candidate in New Jersey’s 7th congressional district Peter Jacob lost the race to Republican party’s Leonard Lance, who got 55 per cent of the votes. Jacob came in a close second garnering 42 per cent of the votes. In Michigan’s 11th District, Democratic Party candidate Anil Kumar lost the race, getting 40 per cent of the votes against Republican candidate Dave Trott who was leading with 53 per cent votes.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) might launch its latest iPhone 7 and 7 Plus models in jet white color, reports Mac Otakara, citing supply chain sources. However, Mac Otakara didn’t mention the time frame of the launch. At present, iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are available in jet black color along with a second black color, as well as gold, rose gold and silver finishes. Analysts observe that Mac Otakara has been precise on numerous occasions about leaking Apple’s information but has also faltered many a times. As far as the jet white color iPhone 7 is considered, the publication itself has added that the information may not be reliable.  There are very high chances of this rumor fizzling out soon. iPhone is one of the primary growth drivers for the company. At its Sep 7 event, Apple announced new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. It does mark a significant improvement over iPhone 6 and paves the way for iPhone 8, which is rumored to be launched around the 10th anniversary of the first iPhone, i.e., next year. Furthermore, the company is expected to gain from the upgrade cycle, especially in mature markets. To further push its advantage, the new iPhones were made available in more than 130 countries, representing the fastest rollout in the history of iPhones. But the macroeconomic headwinds remain for now, especially in China, one of the biggest markets for Apple. Stiff competition is an added concern. APPLE INC Price APPLE INC Price | APPLE INC Quote At present, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the broader tech space include Jabil Circuit Inc. (JBL – Free Report) , Facebook Inc (FB –Free Report) and Intel Corporation (INTC – Free Report) .  Jabil Circuit sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) while Facebook and Intel carry Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Jabil Circuit has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 41.58% of the trailing four quarters while Facebook and Intel have delivered positive earnings surprises of 21.11% and 12.14%, respectively over the same time frame.

Evison is an experienced prosthetics user, having lost his arm in the 80s at the age of 22, just as the first generation of myoelectric limbs - controlled by the detection of electrical signals from the contraction of muscles - were beginning to be introduced to adult patients. But those early devices have nothing on the Bebonic arm. "This," Evison proudly declares, "is the Rolls-Royce of prosthetics. With the old versions I could just contract the first two fingers together. With this I can type, I can use a mouse, I can, to the frequent surprise of waiters, cut up a steak." Evison is speaking as one of a group of engineers, academics and athletes-in-training gathered in a small room at the back of Stoke Mandeville Stadium, the birthplace of the Paralympic movement, to formulate a vision for the future of disabled sport. A future in which there are no limitations on the technologies that can be used, in which even those with the severest of disabilities can compete, and in which powered prosthetics take their users to the same - or greater - ability level of the able-bodied. This October, that future makes its first appearance at the inaugural Cybathlon, a bi-annual bionic athletics event organised by ETH Zurich. Read more Sound waves that mimic the touch of a button? That's the future Sound waves that mimic the touch of a button? That's the future By Chris Stokel-Walker Welcome to the Cyborg Olympics Welcome to the Cyborg Olympics Sport 06 Sep 2016 There's a sense in which the Paralympics hasn't done enough, says Aldo Faisal, associate professor of neurotechnology at Imperial College London. "They focus on elite-level athletes," he says. "It doesn't cater to those with higher-end disabilities, or the promotion of new assistive technologies." The Cybathlon's six disciplines will focus not only on athletic challenges, but also the ability to overcome everyday obstacles, such as climbing stairs (in a wheelchair); opening a jar of jam (with a prosthetic hand); or controlling a computer (and being quadriplegic). And not only will tech teams compete and learn from each other to develop new solutions, so will the athletes themselves. "When I went to Zurich [for the Cybathlon rehearsal] I felt like, hey, there are other people that know the pain, that understand the struggle of doing the simplest things that others take for granted," explains Team Imperial wheelchair pilot Sivashankar Sivakanthan. "We can bounce ideas off each other and learn from each other's experience of dealing with it." ADVERTISEMENT Read more Robo-couriers are breaking the logistics chain to transform how we order online Robo-couriers are breaking the logistics chain to transform how we order online By Luke Dormehl Though at first glance the Paralympics seems the obvious comparison, the Cybathlon, explains the event's creator, Rob Reiner, will be altogether different. His preferred analogy, and one that occurs frequently when you talk to Cybathlon competitors, is Formula One racing. "We award a medal for both the pilots and the technology," the ETH Zurich professor of sensorimotor systems explains. "It's about the skills that they can have in combination." Skills such as Evison's ability to keep his wrist joint perfectly stable while rapidly spinning it through 360°. That full rotation may not seem like much, but that's how technologies are crossing the boundary from restoration into augmentation. At a recent Cybathlon rehearsal, Evison, a pilot for the Imperial team, outperformed able-bodied users in a test of manual dexterity that involved guiding a loop of wire around another piece without touching. Faisal - who sounds mildly affronted when he explains that the obstacle is worth a mere two points - failed to complete it. And there could be real advantages - for example, on production lines, suggests the Imperial team's co-ordinator Ian Radcliffe, where attachments could allow a prosthetics user to screw bolts into a car. "Prosthetic designers are starting to face questions like, is it OK to have a hand that can spin, and spin and spin?" Evison says. "I've had people say to me that if that thing gets any better, I'm going to want to lose my normal limb and have one of those." ADVERTISEMENT Read more Nasa's quest to bring back supersonic flight with its X-planes Nasa's quest to bring back supersonic flight with its X-planes By Richard Benson ETH's Cybathlon gives awards to the athletes and those who create the technology Señor Salme For participants with more extensive disabilities, such as Tom Nabarro, a software engineer for Intel who was paralysed from the neck down in a snowboarding accident in 2007, the competition gets even more interesting. In the brain computer interface (BCI) race, competitors must guide an avatar around a course with the power of their mind alone. An electroencephalography cap detects the electrical signals of activity across the brain, then deep-learning algorithms attempt to extract the small suggestion of an intention amid this noisy, buzzing confusion. "You think of natural actions, like clenching your hand, which comes quite naturally," Nabarro explains. "The concentration is very intense, but you can train by pretending you're playing the game and thinking through those actions every morning." Whereas standard BCI devices can discriminate little more than the equivalent of an on/off switch, the BCI challenge requires the use of four separate controls for running, jumping and steering. "You can think of standard BCI technology as being like a mouse click. We want to give people a keyboard," says Faisal. Read more WIRED Horizons: What does the future look like? WIRED Horizons: What does the future look like? By Jeremy White For Nabarro it's more about moving beyond the standard computer peripherals, to new interfaces between humans and technology. "Working with BCIs is the future of technological interaction," Nabarro says. "I use voice recognition, but it's still based around a mouse or keyboard. And if you think about it, this may not be the most efficient way to interact with a computer." Faisal agrees that human-computer interaction needs re-thinking, but he has something much cheaper than the £200,000 EEG cap in mind. Rather than extracting intentions in the muddled mass of brain activity, he's created a £200 system to read them directly, the way we already do quite easily - in each others' eyes. Combining a front-facing eye-tracking camera, attached to a powered wheelchair, and a forward-facing Kinect that maps the landscape in front, Faisal's system plots the location of the user's gaze on to this landscape, and directs the chair to that direction. "It was really easy to use on the slalom or indoors. And I really loved the accuracy in being able to turn," explains powered-wheelchair pilot, Sivakanthan. "It takes a bit of practice, but it doesn't take that long to learn." "I've had people say to me that if that thing gets any better, I'm going to want to lose my normal limb and have one of those" Kevin Evison, prosthetics user ADVERTISEMENT Beyond merely directional control, this simple eye-tracking system was sophisticated enough to allow the team to win a recent competition in which its entrant painted a picture with a robotic arm while drinking coffee and eating a croissant with their natural upper limbs. "If you want to grab that glass, you will look at it in one specific way, but if you want to assess how full it is you will look at it in a different way," explains Faisal, who has recently been awarded €4 million (£3.3m) by the European Commission Horizon 2020 programme to develop this system into a robotic exoskeleton for those with upper-arm paralysis. The one commonality in all of Team Imperial's solutions is their non-invasiveness. This isn't a requirement of the competition: one team in the functional electrical stimulation bike race, in which electricity is used to stimulate a paralysed person's muscles, have a participant with surgically implanted leg sockets that carry the current directly into muscle fibres for greater stimulation. But for Faisal, this non-invasiveness is essential. "It has to do both with the restorative method - many, many patients just won't qualify for surgery. Psychologically less stable people will be excluded. Older people will be excluded," he explains, "Then there's the other aspect: when you talk about imbuing able-bodied people with new physical powers. You need to have technologies that you can just take off and you're 'normal' again. The mobile phone is an amazing piece of cognitive augmentation - but how successful do you think it would have been if it had required surgery?" Grounded as he is in understanding the real needs of disabled users, Faisal doesn't shy away from exploring the more fantastical implications of such non-invasive augmentative technologies. "If a device can control a wheelchair, then it should be able to help me drive a car," he says. "If I can control a computer game with my mind, then I should be able to control my phone with it. Researchers are working on prosthetics that give you a sense of touch, but why should that be limited to the form of an arm? You could be an aeroplane and feel the wind on the wings. You could be cleaning up a nuclear spill while physically situated in a safe place thousands of miles away. And with non-invasive technologies, we don't need a future of cyborgs running around, half cut-up. You could shrug on a rucksack and become like Shiva with six arms. It would make childcare a lot easier." These are the kinds of applications more typically found in the files of Darpa's big-budget investments, but the beauty of the Cybathlon, explains Faisal, is that its combination of collaboration and competition both pushes these technologies forward and showcases them outside a military context. There is one problem with the current course, at least according to Kevin Evison - it's too easy. "This is just the start," he says. "I'm all for the course getting harder. I want to be able to show off the super-hand, to compete at the level of superhuman abilities."

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News NYU to Award Scholarships to World's Best Young Hackers, Protectors, and Information Security Researchers BROOKLYN, New York, Nov. 9, 2016  /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ — On the eve of the opening of the world’s largest student-led cybersecurity games, New York University’s information security research center announced it will award doctoral scholarships and fellowships to the NYU Tandon School of Engineering to winners who prevail against student hackers and researchers across three continents. The new awards complement more than $1 million in scholarships previously announced for high school students who will prove their mettle alongside undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral students at the NYU Cyber Security Awareness Week (CSAW) finals November 10-12, 2015. Continue Reading Judges for the CSAW Applied Research Challenge select finalists from among the best young security researchers, determined by their already-published work. Representatives from each of the finalist teams then present their findings to a panel of distinguished judges. The CSAW challenge is widely acknowledged as the leading best-paper award in the field. Newly announced scholarships to NYU Tandon aim to help such students advance their groundbreaking research. For the first time in the 13-year history of CSAW, the final round of contests will expand beyond NYU Tandon in Downtown Brooklyn to regional hubs at NYU Abu Dhabi – for finalists from North Africa and the Middle East – and the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur  – where finalists from across India will compete. To qualify for the final rounds this week, students bested more than 10,000 competitors worldwide in remote preliminary challenges. “We were gratified by the enthusiastic response and high participation in the inaugural international CSAW, and we know these contests will prove to be effective in engaging and educating students throughout the world in this vital field,” said Ramesh Karri, NYU Tandon professor of electrical engineering and co-founder of the NYU Center for Cyber Security. “We expect to face a shortfall of 1.5 million cybersecurity experts by 2020,” Karri said, citing a widely quoted Frost and Sullivan forecast. “But even that startling number may understate the scope of what we face in trying to protect our personal security, business, critical infrastructure, and national defense. It may prove extraordinarily difficult to find highly educated, brilliant researchers whose far-sighted work can change the security game. That was a major reason that the NYU Center for Cyber Security decided to offer scholarships to CSAW winners – among the best young cybersecurity minds in the world.  We want to open opportunities for them disrupt the future through doctoral studies and beyond.” For those who qualify for admission to NYU Tandon’s highly competitive doctoral programs, scholarships will include full tuition and fellowships. Recipients must win first place at any of the three regional hubs in three contests: the signature software hacking competition, Capture the Flag (CTF); the hardware hacking and protection challenge called the Embedded Security Challenge; and the prestigious best-paper contest called the Applied Research Challenge, which evaluates research that was already peer reviewed for presentation at scholarly conferences and journals. The scholarship winners will be offered the possibility of joint advisement by faculty at IIT Kanpur, one the premier institutes in India for engineering education and research. It recently started a center for cybersecurity for critical infrastructure. “IIT Kanpur played a pioneering role in computer science education in India several decades ago, and hopes to play similar pioneering role in cybersecurity education, research, and awareness in the coming years,” said Manindra Agrawal, the N. Rama Rao Professor in the IIT Kanpur’s Department of Computer Science and Engineering. “We are delighted to join hands with the New York University Tandon School of Engineering to bring the cyber security awareness competitions to India, and to work together to educate the next generation of scholars in this important area.” NYU Tandon is an internationally recognized center for cybersecurity research and education. It has received all three Center of Excellence designations from the National Security Agency and the United States Cyber Command.  It joined with the School of Law and other NYU schools to form the NYU Center for Cybersecurity (CCS). This interdisciplinary consortium explores new approaches to security and privacy by reaching beyond technology in its research and education, as well as in outreach to shape the public discourse on policy, legal, and technological issues of cybersecurity. Other CSAW prizes will include: All finalists – from nearly 90 teams worldwide – will be considered on a case-by-case basis for admission to NYU Tandon master’s degree programs with partial tuition and fellowship. Cash prizes will be awarded for all first, second, and third-place collegiate teams. Over $1 million in scholarships will be offered to all finalists and winners of the CSAW High School Forensics (HSF) Challenge at NYU Tandon. Scholarships are contingent on admission to NYU Tandon and satisfactory academic progress. New this year, NYU Tandon will award each HSF finalist school a cash prize.  The HSF awards at NYU Tandon are supported by a grant from the U.S. National Security Agency.

Two years back, the company applied for and was granted a patent for using drones to carry screens and pyrotechnics. Now, on Monday, Disney announced that it had been given permission from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to use these drones. Disney drones, which would be programmable and semi-autonomous, will direct the formations such as displaying pixels in a giant TV screen formation in the sky. The approval from FAA, which granted Disney a waiver from existing laws controlling drone movement, is not permanent and can be revoked at anytime. It is valid for a period of four years and the company must use authorized remote pilots and prevent the drones from flying uncontrolled over guest-occupied areas. Related Stories Disney's One-Legged Robot Can Hop 19 Times Without Falling Over Specialized Intel Drone For Air Shows Unveiled Disney says that its “imagineers” have some "amazing ideas," although currently the unmanned aerial vehicles can only be flown at night. The company plans to use the technology to enhance its Springs Holiday experience during Nov. 11–Jan. 8 at Walt Disney World, Orlando, featuring a giant Christmas tree drone formation. The company is also working on a yet-to-be-announced nighttime drone show above the Walt Disney World Lake. Drones are fast becoming an attractive option for light shows — Intel also recently unveiled its Shooting Star quadcopter drone, which will form drone swarm formulations to entertain an audience.

(Photo: Brock Elliott) Longtime State Farm agent helps clients, the community State Farm agent Mary Contreras established her business in 1994 in the East Valley. She focuses on providing auto, home, renters’ and business insurance. Her business is set apart from her competitors by an unparalleled passion to serve her clients’ best interests. “We have worked to develop a culture of putting our clients first in every decision,” Contreras said. “The talent and tenure of our team is recognized Valleywide for their quality and we have a unique ability to look at the numbers and develop elegant solutions with affordable premium – utilizing creativity and solutions-based problem-solving from my engineering background.” And, she said, her team “services and pays claims for what we sell. We strive to keep clients for life.” Her mission is simple: to be her clients’ primary source for insurance and financial services. “My team members and I pledge to provide an environment of mutual respect and open communication,” she said. “We will review the insurance and financial services products with you to help meet your individual needs. We will continually improve upon our knowledge and the level of customer service we provide. “ Skip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share Advertiser Video: Contreras State Farm Agency Her superior service has caught the attention of State Farm. Last year, she won the State Farm Chairman’s Circle and Ambassador Awards. Contreras is as dedicated to the community as she is to her clients. Her teen driver counseling programs deliver information and readiness tips to new drivers that help ensure their first years are a little safer. Contreras is a member of the Chandler Chamber of Commerce, past chair of the Women in Business Council, a director of the Chandler Chamber Community Foundation and the Chandler Chamber Liaison to Intel’s Community Advisory Committee. Contreras and her team invite all clients and families twice annually for their Spring Fling and Pumpkin Patch events, at which a complimentary windshield repair clinic is held, where Contreras pays for clients’ windshield repairs to keep their insurance costs low. She has offered this service for 15 years to her neighbors and clients. She also is active with the American Heart Association. An accomplished artist, each year she dedicates a “heart” painting to a Heart Association auction in memory of her mother, Marjorie Bielmaier. Her mother’s untimely death is part of what motivates her to help others. Her mother passed away from a heart attack at age 54 in 1987. “My father became progressively ill over his grief,” she said. She discovered that because of incompetence on the part of professionals helping her family, it was going to cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to keep the land that her family relied on to make a living. “I’m in my current job to make a difference for every life I touch,” she said. “No one on my watch will endure the things that my family did.” Now, after almost 23 years in the insurance business, Contreras is looking at the future of her business. “There is an opportunity for an individual interested in becoming a State Farm agent,” she said. “Our aspirant program is looking for candidates who want to work into this agency through an apprenticeship with our office. I have a great program for the right person.” Story from: Mary Contreras, State Farm 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://azc.cc/2eBvigu Chandler Chamber of Commerce Chandler Chamber: Vision for business, growth and prosperity Oct 28, 2016 More Stories from Chandler Chamber of Commerce Chandler rising to embrace tomorrow, today Sponsor story Banking on community connections Sponsor story Bursting with creativity Sponsor story One of a kind Sponsor story

More Details About Dell's x86 Windows 10 Mobile Phone Emerge GO 6.4-inch display and up to 8GB RAM planned for the device Nov 9, 2016 05:52 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Photos of Dell’s very own x86 Windows 10 Mobile device got leaked the last weekend and new information that reached the web today provides us with a closer glimpse at how exactly the company planned this phone to work. Codenamed Dell Stack, the x86 Windows 10 Mobile device was more of a small tablet, as it featured a display of no less than 6.4 inches in size, according to leaker Evan Blass. And although this might seem huge at first glance, Dell had a different goal in mind when going for such a large display. The Stack was supposed to serve multiple purposes and be used as a desktop and laptop as well, using the power of Continuum, the Windows 10 Mobile feature that allows a phone to double as a desktop when connected to an external screen. Might never launch Work on the project started in mid-2014, the same source adds, and was supposed to enable users to always have their data with them, without cloud transfers that take place between devices. Basically, Dell aimed to offer users full portability with a device that can be easily carried around, but at the same time, without compromising the desktop, tablet, or phone experience in any way. Furthermore, it appears that the phone was capable of running the full Windows 10 when docked, which means that it offered a truly genuine desktop experience to users. The Dell Stack was developed to be powered by Intel’s Kaby Lake Y-series x86 processors, and the company planned different configurations, including m3, m5 vPro, and m7 vPro. There were several hardware options as well, with either 4GB or 8GB RAM, 128GB or 256GB storage (plus the typical microSD card support that’s offered on the majority of Windows phones). The 6.4-inch device was designed to measure less than 9 mm in thickness, and come with features such as an iris scanner for Microsoft’s Windows Hello biometric authentication. At the moment, it’s not yet clear if Dell still wants to release the device, but it appears that it was originally scheduled to go live in spring of 2017. Dell might have very well canceled it, but the current state of the phone is unknown, so it remains to be seen if the company launches it or not. But even if it doesn’t, x86 Windows phones might have a future, and there’s no doubt that Microsoft needs to be part of it. #Microsoft#Windows Phone#Windows 10 Mobile#Dell subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Lenovo to Launch Windows Phone After Blasting Microsoft for Mobile Strategy Discontinued Microsoft Lumia Guilin Windows Phone Leaks in Press Render Microsoft Finds a Way to Make Windows Phones and PCs Even More Personal The Leaked Intel-Powered Windows Phone Was Not the Surface Phone Firefox 50.0 Officially Released for Linux, Mac and Windows, Here's What's New Some U.S. Android Phones Have Secret Backdoor That Sends Data to China Apple Insider Says iPhone 6 Plus Has a Major Bug, Company Should Start Recall Hackers Steal FIFA Currency, Buy Houses and Expensive Cars with the Money Microsoft Pledges to Completely Retire Office 2007 Next Year X.Org Server 1.19.0 Officially Released, Coming Soon to a Linux Distro Near You Red Hat Software Collections 2.3 and Red Hat Developer Toolset 6 Available Now Linux Kernel 4.4.32 LTS Adds Networking Improvements, Updated AMDGPU Drivers    Dell Stack, the company's first x86 Windows phone new windows phone apps My Vehicles: Log all expenses related to the maintenance of your car(s) with a smart app for your phone Easy Shopping: Get a friendly assistant for your shopping sessions and use it on the go, from your phone Briefcase: A complete file management solution that supports local files and OneDrive content HQ Music Downloader: A useful helper for finding and getting the preferred music tracks while on the go Gloomlogue: Customize you photos with amazing effects and filters then share the pics on the go Percentages: A useful pack of percentage calculators you can use on your Windows Phone while on the go Account Vault: A simple app made to provide a safe haven for login credentials and other personal data Reader comments HP Elite X3 with Windows 10 Mobile: The PC Experience more on: HP Elite X3 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Apple Inc. sparked the smartphone revolution, but Android spread it to the masses. The software backed by Google parent company Alphabet Inc. powers more than 85 percent of the roughly 1.5 billion new smartphones sold each year. Yet for all its success, Android looks increasingly in danger of falling apart.  That's because the companies that teamed up to make Android a hit -- principally Google and Samsung Electronics Co. -- are increasingly working at cross purposes. Google has just started to sell its first smartphone that competes with its ostensible partner Samsung, and for now it has kept for itself crucial voice-assistant technology that makes the Google phones more appealing than those of other Android manufacturers.  Now Samsung plans to use its own digital assistant for smartphones in competition with Google. Other makers of Android smartphone handsets, principally Chinese firms such as Xiaomi Corp., have also extricated themselves from parts of the Android system. Once successful Google hardware partners, including HTC Corp. and Lenovo Group Ltd., are struggling with their smartphone businesses and are no longer useful Android allies. Coalitions only hold together if all the partners are successful and share common interests. That's no longer a given with Android.  Google started backing Android in the first place because it was worried Apple (and Microsoft, and the phone companies) could find ways to disadvantage or block Google's web search on smartphones. Android was Google's effort to build its own smartphone playground and ensure Google stayed relevant as more computing activities moved from PC web browsers to mobile gadgets. That strategy panned out. But controlling the operating system no longer gives Google a guarantee to siphon and harness all the world's digital information. The more time people spend using Facebook, Snapchat or Siri on their phones -- even on Android phones -- the more data is being generating out of Google's reach. Wresting back some of that power and consumer information is a significant motivation behind Google's efforts to create smartphones that it designs and controls from the chips to the apps. For their part, Samsung and other handset makers know they can no longer rely on Google for their mobile existence. Samsung agreed in October to buy Viv Labs, a startup working on a Siri-like voice technology. In China and India, local companies sell Android smartphones with local versions of app stores in place of Google Play. In some cases, it's possible to use Android smartphones without interacting much with Google. All these moves are signs of the fraying Android coalition. The coalition of the willing isn't willing anymore. It isn't unusual for cracks to emerge in tech alliances. Partners Microsoft, Intel and personal computer manufacturers haven't always been on the same page about the Windows operating system -- a business that mirrors Android in many ways. At times, PC hardware makers felt as if Microsoft was getting the better end of the deal. While Microsoft got rich on Windows software, PC hardware makers were left to fight over single-digit percentage profit margins at best from making and selling Windows computers. In the Android alliance, Google makes the lion's share of the profits, too.  In short, it's hard to stay friends for long in the technology industry, as Google is finding out.  The Windows coalition has held through the turmoil, though Windows never branched far beyond personal computers and computer servers to other devices. The PC is now a fringe of computing, and Windows isn't even the heart of Microsoft anymore. It's not clear how this all shakes out for Android and Google. In contrast to Windows, Android is moving far beyond the smartphone into powering thermostats, web streaming gadgets hooked up to televisions and virtual reality headsets. But if the coalition can't stay together, the big risk is Android turns out to be a crucial technology, but not an enduring one -- the laser disc player of computing.  This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

It is quite truly a midlife cycle spec refresh and nothing more. Most people will probably be just fine with one of the less expensive Surface Books, which haven’t been updated, but if you want to pony up to the top of the line, that top is slightly higher than before. The question now is do you plunk down $3,000 for this ultimate Surface Book, or do you wait for the inevitable Surface Book 2 that will likely come next year? If you have a Surface Book already, it doesn't make much sense to upgrade this soon into its lifespan. And there is certainly a good argument to be made to wait for the Microsoft's next revision, which will likely have Intel's seventh-generation processor. But if you can't wait, and you're looking for the ultimate Windows laptop, it's hard to look past Microsoft's latest Surface Book. I doubt Microsoft sells a lot of these Surface Books - in fact, I think they're only available in like 3 countries - but they probably serve more as a halo device for the Surface Pro. Still, looks like a really nice, if a very, very expensive, laptop.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Mobile Phones Lenovo to use Moto branding for all future phones Mobile Phones Lenovo to use Moto branding for all future phones By Bindu Nair - Nov 9, 2016 Lenovo may be planning big changes for its smartphone business, with a new report alleging that it’s going to stop selling phones under its own name and just use Motorola’s ‘Moto’ moniker for all its handsets in the future. The news comes amid a dismal showing in the second fiscal quarter of 2016. Lenovo has been trying to determine a successful strategy for its phone portfolio ever since it took over Motorola back in 2014. It had previously decided to market Moto and Lenovo devices separately in order to prevent overlap. Now it seems the brand has decided to go for a completely new approach. As per Campaign Asia, smartphone sales for Lenovo and Moto were $2 billion in the second fiscal quarter of 2016, a 12% year-over-year fall. The former’s CEO and Chairman Yang Yuanqing tried to put a positive spin on the results by asserting that its mobile division had a good quarter-to-quarter volume growth of 20% and margin improvement.

The brand’s PCs are still king when it comes to sales, contributing to 70% of total revenue per year. Other the massive shift in strategy, the company is also overhauling its internal leadership. Xudong Chen is now being replaced by Gina Qiao as the co-president and SVP of Lenovo’s Mobile Business Group in China. The move is apparently meant to improve the firm’s marketing capacity in the country. According to Yang, the brand’s overseas smartphone performance has been better than China’s. Lenovo has also hired a trio of executives from Intel, Microsoft and Alcatel-Lucent so that it can slowly transition from a hardware company to a customer-oriented one which focuses on devices with cloud services and artificial intelligence.
