This NVMe SSD will come in a M.2 2280 form factor and use the PCI-Express 3.0 x4 interface. The 610p will be available in capacities of 128, 256, 512GB and 1 and 2 TB.   The information comes from the Taiwanese website BenchLife who also posted a snippet of an Intel roadmap. The roadmap indicates the 610p will be based on 3D TLC NAND flash memory from Intel and Micron’s IMFlash joint venture. Users who are interested in in the 610p series SSDs will have to wait a little, according to BenchLife the drives will come no earlier than the 4th quarter of 2017. Intel also appears to be planning a BGA version of the 600p series. These are multi-chip modules that combine the NAND memory and the SSD controller in a single package. These are especially useful for laptops and small-form factor desktops. The 600p BGA variant will come in a M.2 1620 formfactor and will be available in capacities of 128, 256 and 512GB.

Windows 10 Mobile, for now at least, is an operating system for ARM-based devices only. But could -- and should -- it one day also power Intel-based tablets and phones? By Mary Jo Foley for All About Microsoft | November 8, 2016 -- 20:12 GMT (12:12 PST) | Topic: Windows 10 Right now, Windows 10 Mobile, Microsoft's version of Windows 10 for small-screen devices, runs only on ARM. But that isn't stopping people from speculating if and when Windows 10 Mobile might run on Intel chips. When Microsoft was developing the first version of Windows 10, the company's plan was to enable Windows 10 Mobile to run on ARM and Intel, my sources told me repeatedly. Whenever I wrote about Windows 10 in the build-up to RTM of the first version in July 2015, I described Windows 10 Mobile as "the version of Windows 10 that is expected to work on Windows Phones and smaller Windows tablets running ARM and most likely Intel processors." But when Microsoft finally released Windows 10 to the masses, Windows 10 Mobile was an ARM-only operating system. And, since that time, this has continued to be the case. More Windows 10 Microsoft: Windows 7 is way more exposed to ransomware than Windows 10 Windows 10 supremacy? Eve V comes gunning for Microsoft's mighty Surface Pro 4 Microsoft releases Windows 10 Creators Update test build 14965 Tips, tricks and shortcuts: Ed Bott makes Windows 10 work for you Microsoft quietly fixes second Surface Pro 3 battery problem Windows 10 tip: How to enable the built-in Administrator account (and why you shouldn't) While some company watchers said they believed Microsoft's long-rumored Surface Phone might be an Intel-based device, I never heard that from my contacts. Whenever I heard from my contacts about a Surface Phone, the device always was described as ARM-based, which makes sense to me, as ARM continues to be a better in terms of power efficiency. Traditional Win32 apps can't run on ARM-based devices, but Remote Desktop software/services does provide a solution (though a complex and often pricey one) I went back and looked at notes from a conversation I had with Windows and Devices chief Terry Myerson just prior to the Aug. 2 release this year of Windows 10 'Redstone 1". (I didn't run his response on mobile and chipsets before now, as it didn't seem material to my post about the Windows 10 Anniversary Update.) But here's what Myerson told me when I asked about Windows 10 Mobile ever running on Intel: "Today, Windows Mobile is for 7- or 8-inch devices running the ARM chipset. Over time, you will see our goal is to give partners access to all screen sizes and chip sets of choice." I have no idea how much time "over time" implies. I also have no idea whether the Intel-based, Windows 10 "Dell Stack" tablet and phone devices described by Evan Blass in a recent VentureBeat post will ever materialize. (Blass said Dell and Intel were working together on the concepts since 2014, which means they may have withered when Microsoft's initial plans to have Windows 10 Mobile run on Intel didn't materialize right out of the gate. Or maybe the tablet shown in the renders Blass posted was/is just going to run plain-old Windows 10 and not Windows 10 Mobile.) Going back to Windows 10 Mobile, Myerson's comments do leave the door open, at least hypothetically, for Windows 10 Mobile to run one day on Intel. For now, however, Microsoft engineers seem intent on honing Windows 10 Mobile as Microsoft's Windows on ARM and cellular play, as Myerson told me a couple of weeks ago.

Intel’s drone are delivering increasingly impressive light shows, but that may be only the beginning. The tech company unveiled its new “shooting star” drone Friday as it released a video of 500 of the drones flying in formation in Germany this fall. The autonomous drones, which are essentially an LED light with propellers attached, darted around the sky, spelling out “500” and “Intel.” The drone shows could rival fireworks displays. But Intel sees a lot more potential than wowing crowds on the 4th of July. Anil Nanduri, Intel’s vice president of its New Technology Group, noted to CNNMoney that companies spend heavily to promote new products. “Think of a display in the sky,” Nanduri said. “What would you do with it?” By spelling out “Intel” with its 500 drones, the company has shown that advertising a corporate logo is doable. And as more drones are added to its light shows, it will be capable of even more complicated designs. Intel reached the 500 drone barrier less than a year after flying 100 drones simultaneously. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich has previously talked of flying 1,000 drones at once. Since Intel’s drones fly autonomously, only a handful of people are needed to operate a huge light show. When Intel demonstrated the 500 drones in Germany, three or four people were monitoring the drones. Nanduri sees the lights as a favorable alternative to fireworks due to pollution and noise concerns. The flying drones also allow for synchronizing with music. Intel’s drones weigh just over half a pound, and their batteries last for 20 minutes. Intel isn’t the only one wanting to use drones for lights shows or creative advertising. Last week, Disney received a waiver from the federal government to fly drones at its theme parks. Disney wants to use “Flixels,” autonomous drones with LED lights, to accompany entertainment, including fireworks shows. And Uber has used drones in Mexico City to hover in front of cars stopped in traffic and advertise its services. Nanduri said he’s eager to bring the technology to the United States, but said more testing was needed first. Intel has already received an FAA waiver to fly its autonomous drone flights at night in the United States. Nanduri, who has two young children, said the drone project finally convinced his kids their dad has a cool job. “When they saw the light show,” Nanduri recalled, “They said, ‘Wow your team did that?'” Filed in: News Topics: drone, Drones Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Email Team 3 Professionals Visit them today!

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Nov 7, 2016 at 4:42PM Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), the biggest mobile chipmaker in the world, will soon also become the world's largest automotive chipmaker after it closes its $47 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI). NXP only became the world's top automotive chipmaker last year, after it bought its rival Freescale for nearly $12 billion. Image source: Getty Images. This game-changing acquisition will send waves across the chipmaking industry, and investors should be aware of how the move could affect smaller automotive chipmakers, such as NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY). NVIDIA One of NVIDIA's smartest moves in recent years was pivoting its Tegra mobile systems on a chip (SOCs) away from smartphones and tablets, where they were marginalized by Qualcomm's Snapdragon SoCs, toward connected cars. High-end automakers installed Tegra chips into their infotainment and navigation systems, and NVIDIA's automotive chips became one of its key growth drivers. Last quarter, NVIDIA's automotive revenue rose 68% annually to $119 million and accounted for 8% of its top line. NVIDIA is trying to expand that business further with Drive PX, a turnkey platform for autonomous vehicles. Major automakers such as BMW, Daimler, and Ford are already testing out Drive PX, and the platform could make it much easier for automakers to produce driverless vehicles. Image source: NVIDIA. But here's the problem -- when NXP acquired Freescale last year, it inherited BlueBox, another turnkey autonomous driving platform which competes against Drive PX. NXP already supplies the chips that control driver assistance systems to eight of the 10 leading automakers in the world, which provides it with a natural foothold in driverless vehicles. Earlier this year, Qualcomm introduced its Snapdragon Automotive processors, which modify its mobile SoCs for vehicles to counter NVIDIA's Tegra. Once Qualcomm closes the deal and bundles NXP's automotive chips, Bluebox, and Snapdragon Automotive together, NVIDIA's automotive business could struggle to keep up. Intel Intel recently partnered with advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) maker Mobileye and BMW to develop a fully autonomous vehicle platform by 2021. That move expands on Intel's other moves to expand into driverless cars, including the acquisitions of Internet-of-Things functional safety company Yogitech and computer vision companies Itseez and Movidius. Intel's chips already power infotainment and navigation systems in select Hyundai, BMW, Kia, and Infiniti vehicles, but its presence is small compared with NXP and NVIDIA. Intel already fell behind a major technological curve when it lost the mobile market to ARM chipmakers such as Qualcomm and MediaTek. Since connected cars are often considered the next big computing platform, Intel must establish a foothold in this market to diversify away from its slower-growth PC and data center businesses. Qualcomm's purchase of NXP could make that very tough, since the combined company could bundle together a much wider variety of automotive chips than Intel. That competition could throttle the growth of Intel's fledgling IoT business, which grew its sales by 19% annually last quarter. Mobileye Mobileye established a first-mover's advantage in the ADAS market by linking older cameras and radars to braking systems. These solutions, which 90% of the world's major automakers use, are more cost-efficient ways to improve vehicle safety without the installation of pricey LIDAR systems or onboard computers. To address the needs of autonomous vehicles, Mobileye -- along with its longtime partner STMicroelectronics -- developed the EyeQ line of computer vision chips. Mobileye has posted double-digit sales growth in every quarter since its IPO in 2014. However, there are rising concerns that Mobileye will struggle to fend off bigger rivals such as NVIDIA and Qualcomm/NXP. Tesla Motors recently discontinued its partnership with Mobileye over concerns about its EyeQ-powered Autopilot system, leaving the door wide open for competitors to swoop in. Its aforementioned partnership with Intel should provide Mobileye with some financial support, but it's unclear if it can remain relevant against NVIDIA and NXP's newer computer vision plays. Should you fear the 800-pound gorilla? Qualcomm has now become the 800-pound gorilla of automotive chips, but investors shouldn't assume that the chipmaker can simply boot NVIDIA, Intel, and Mobileye out of the market. NVIDIA and Mobileye both have deep roots in the industry, and Intel can make additional acquisitions to strengthen its foothold. Nonetheless, investors should keep a close eye on Qualcomm's alarming advance into the growing market for connected cars. Leo Sun owns shares of Ford and Qualcomm.

Intel began its foray into drones in 2015, and new software allows the craft to create designs, and even choose drones based on battery life and GPS reception. In an official press release, Anil Nanduri, Intel’s vice president of new technology and UAV general manager said, “With this drone, we will be able to demonstrate that drone light shows can redefine entertainment and create amazing new experiences in the night sky.” He added that the computer chip manufacturer set a new Guinness world record for having the most drones airborne simultaneously.  © Flickr/ US Air Force Plot Thickens: Tunisia 'Has Reasons to Hide US Drone Base' Intel had to acquire a Part 107 waiver from the Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) to design the Shooting Star, allowing the craft to fly beyond the usual limits for that kind of vehicle. The Shooting Star has a six-inch rotor diameter and weighs just 280 grams. It also has a light emitting diode (LED) allowing it to beam about 4 million unique color configurations. The company reports,"The fleet is easily programmed, assembled and operated to create beautifully choreographed images in the nighttime sky," According to Digital Trends.

(NASDAQ:AMD) [Trend Analysis] moved down reacts as active mover, shares a decrease -2.09% to traded at $6.56 and the percentage gap among open changing to regular change was -0.15%. AMD’s upcoming enthusiast processor lineup based on the Zen architecture would allegedly be featuring special variants aimed at overclockers. The rumor comes from Bitsnchips who are saying that these processors will be part of the Summit Ridge family. The rumor points out that there would be at least one such variant in the Summit Ridge family. The part will feature 8 cores based on the Zen architecture. These special, enthusiast-grade chips would ensure high OC margins but also ship with higher frequencies compared to standard 95W variants. The TDP would remain at 95W for the higher clocked variants given that these are cherry picked. It seems like these variants would be same to Intel’s “Unlocked” series processors. Intel K-Series chips are also aimed at a same market however, these are the only chips in Intel Core lineup that can be overclocked. AMD on the other hand, offers unlocked multiplier across all chips. But the special variants would generally be optimized for overclocking and enthusiast use. The firm’s current ratio calculated as 1.90 for the most recent quarter. The firm past twelve months price to sales ratio was 1.49. As far as the returns are concern, the return on equity was recorded as 232.40% and return on investment was -27.10% while its return on asset stayed at -16.90%.

Thanks, TC Team Disrupt LondonCo-founder Of DeepMind, Mustafa Suleyman, To Speak At Disrupt London Save £250 On Tickets Now Tech companies don’t want to talk about the lack of disability diversity reporting Posted Nov 7, 2016 by Steve O'Hear (@sohear) 0 SHARES Next Story PetSmart takes on Amazon with launch of same-day delivery and subscriptions Advertisement “Would you mind having an off-the-record conversation about your questions? Is that Ok?” said the PR rep at a leading publicly listed technology company. “Err… sure,” I replied, more than a little puzzled. The questions  —  which I put to Intel, Apple, Twitter, Facebook, Slack, Google, and Salesforce  — were pretty straightforward. I simply wanted to know why none of the major technology companies in the U.S. (with the exception of LinkedIn) include disability in their public diversity reporting, and if they had plans to do so. “Great,” continued the PR. “Let me tell you what I’ve found out…”. What came next, of course, I can’t quote or attribute to anybody at the company. Outside of a parallel public relations universe, this conversation never actually took place. I approached the next name on my list and a pattern began to emerge. “[Still] to be decided on what I’ll be able to share on the record, but I can definitely give you some information on background,” came a now-familiar reply. Others wanted to know who else I had asked, perhaps for fear of saying too much or making an unnecessary first move. “When is your deadline?” was also a stock response, before, in a number of instances, the trail went dead. It seems that many leading U.S. technology companies don’t want to talk about disability and employee diversity — at least not publicly. Why does this matter? According to data collected by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2015 only 17.5 percent of persons with a disability (PWDs) were employed and this compares to 65 percent for those without a disability. The Bureau also says that although the official unemployment rate for PWDs (counted as persons who do not have a job, are available for work, and are actively looking for a job) fell to 10.7 percent in 2015, it was still twice that of those without a disability, which stood at 5.1 percent. In 2015 only 17.5 percent of persons with a disability were employed and this compares to 65.0 percent for those without a disability. Now, as someone with quite a severe disability, I would be the first to acknowledge that there are myriad reasons why a PWD could find it difficult to secure employment or to work at all, and that employers aren’t always to blame. Agism could also be a factor, since disability disproportionately affects older people. And so could educational attainment; by some measurements, PWDs are less likely to be degree educated than those without. However, the Bureau of Labor Statistics is very clear: across all age groups and all levels of education, PWDs were much less likely to be employed than were their counterparts with no disability. That said, there are also many practical things employers can do to help PWDs overcome challenges at work, and in turn benefit from a workforce truly made up of all the talents. Why pick on the tech industry? At its best, technology acts as an enabler for PWDs, helping to level the playing field, and therefore can be a genuine force for social mobility. However, since disability isn’t included in most technology companies’ public diversity reporting, what we don’t know is how well the technology industry itself is doing with regards to the number of PWDs it employs and how this compares company to company. Without the data to back it up we can’t say for sure if a company is becoming more diverse, regardless of what efforts they say they are taking or how much PR they generate. The reason why an increasing number of technology companies publish diversity reports regards gender, race and ethnicity— and why it’s important that they do so — is it sends a signal to other prospective employees that a workplace is inclusive and that diversity matters. Crucially, it also enables publications like this one to hold those companies to account. Without the data to back it up we can’t say for sure if a company is becoming more diverse, regardless of what efforts they say they are taking or how much PR they generate. Here are the specific questions I put to Intel, Apple, Twitter, Facebook, Slack, Google and Salesforce: Do you include PWDs or equivalent in your public diversity reporting? If no, why not? And, if no, do you have any plans to do so? If you do in actual fact collect this data (but choose not to publish it) are you able to share what percentage of your workforce identifies as a PWD? What is the company doing to encourage and support more PWDs getting into the tech industry? Slack The first to reply and most open was Slack. “Early thought is that Slack will include that information in our diversity reporting, as we are legally able to capture it, and employees are willing to share it,” said a spokesperson. The point here is that, if I understand correctly, you can’t legally force employees to declare if they have a disability to prevent against discrimination. Any reporting has to be non-mandatory and self-identified. The company was also willing to talk about efforts being made within the organisation and Slack’s inclusive culture. However, since it doesn’t currently track “disability status” it couldn’t provide data on how many PWDs the company employs. While we don’t track disability status today, we have channels in Slack where employees can opt in to discuss and self-identify… We keep an open dialogue with our PWD employees to get their input on how and where we invest in accessibility within the office (interpreters for meetings, considering new accessibility technologies, for example), and we’ve also hired some terrific people who are helping us create a product that is accessible for everyone. Apple Apple doesn’t currently include PWD employment data in its public diversity reporting. At first the company pointed me to its accessibility efforts with regards to its own products , something it also highlighted in a video shown at the recent new MacBook Pro launch. I understand that Apple believes making its products accessible is the best way to signal that the company welcomes employees with disabilities. However, I’m unconvinced you can spin the lack of PWD diversity reporting (and therefore accountability) into a discussion about product design. After I told Apple that all of the other major technology companies approached were going on record (which turned out not to be true), the company offered the following statement: Since our earliest days, Apple has encouraged people with disabilities to pursue careers in tech and help inform features on all of our products. We’ll continue to do that because we believe everyone should be able to use technology to do what they love. We foster a diverse culture that’s inclusive of people with disabilities because we understand that inclusion inspires innovation. Twitter Twitter does not include PWDs in its reporting but declined to go on record. However, I understand the company follows the EEO-1 report guidelines (required by the U.S. government), which doesn’t include PWDs. It also has processes for applicants, future employees and current employees to request accommodations related to their disabilities, and Twitter engages to reasonably accommodate these requests. Like Apple, the company pointed me to its accessibility efforts from a product perspective, and I understand that Twitter sees inclusion as a leading principle of the company. Intel Intel were surprisingly forthcoming. A spokesperson for the company told me it does not currently include data on employees with disabilities in its annual and mid-year diversity and inclusion reports, but “as the reports evolve” this could change. They were also keen to highlight the diversity work Intel is currently doing, some of which directly relates to working with PWDs: Right now, our $300 million Diversity & Inclusion in Technology Initiative and 2020 goal is focused around increasing representation of women and underrepresented minorities in our U.S. workforce. However, we have a broad view of diversity and inclusion which extends to employees with disabilities as well as veterans, who may not be accounted for in our diversity and inclusion reports but are not discounted internally. Through a combination of employee resource groups such as the Intel Diverse Abilities Network and accommodations, we are focused on creating a work environment where they can thrive and succeed. The Intel Diverse Abilities Network provides a network of support and sponsors education efforts for employees who have disabilities or have loved ones impacted by disability. Since the statement was provided, Intel announced it has expanded its diversity fund to include support for PWDs. That’s progress. Facebook, Salesforce, and Google All three companies responded on the 18th of October to my original request, with Facebook and Salesforce asking when my deadline was. Despite following up again 7 days later, I’ve still yet to hear back from either company. Meanwhile, the correct spokesperson for Google still could not be reached at the time of publication. Conclusion One of the off-the-record arguments put forward to not include PWDs in diversity reporting is that the resulting data would be inaccurate. Since not all employees with a disability would feel comfortable declaring that they have one, and not every disability is visible, the process would be prone to under-reporting. However, it is hard to see how technology companies can have it both ways: talking up an inclusive and supportive workplace culture whilst at the same time claiming that PWDs would be too afraid to identify as such. Either way, if the technology industry is serious about employee diversity with regards to PWDs, then it needs to find a way to be accountable. You can’t solve the PWD diversity reporting problem until you admit that you have one. The first step is to begin talking about it.

Eine durchgesickerte Roadmap nennt nun erstmals den Nachfolger: Intel SSD 610p. Im gleichen M.2-Formfaktor soll dieser die Maximalkapazität auf 2 TByte anheben. Außerdem enthüllt die Roadmap eine 600p als BGA-Chip und das 2,5"-Modell 545s. Anzeige Benchlife hat einen Ausschnitt der besagten Roadmap veröffentlicht. Bei Enthüllungen dieser Art hat sich die Website bisher als verlässlich erwiesen. Die Zeitleiste ist auf der Abbildung nicht zu sehen, doch heißt es im Bericht, dass die Einführung der 610p im vierten Quartal 2017 erfolgen soll. Allerdings trägt die 610p in der Roadmap noch den Status „in Planung“, sodass der „Launch“ auch später erfolgen könnte. Wie aktuell die Grafik ist, geht aus dem Bericht nicht hervor. Die bereits erhältliche 600p soll wiederum im dritten Quartal 2018 eingestellt (EOL) werden. Intels neue PCIe-SSD ist wie der Vorgänger mit 3D-TLC-NAND von IMFT (Intel/Micron) bestückt und unterstützt das NVMe-Protokoll. Auf den 80 mm langen Modulen werden bis zu 2 TByte Speicherplatz geboten, die 600p ist mit maximal 1 TByte erhältlich. Ob der gleiche SM2260-Controller Verwendung findet, geht aus den Informationen nicht hervor. Inoffizielle Roadmap enthüllt Intel SSD 610p (Bild: Benchlife) 600p als Single-Package-SSD Noch vor der 610p soll im dritten Quartal eine BGA-Variante der 600p erscheinen. Der Formfaktor wird mit M.2 1620 näher spezifiziert. Damit ist das Chip-Gehäuse 16 × 20 mm klein, genau wie es zum Beispiel bei der Toshiba BG-Serie der Fall ist. Die Single-Package-SSD wird direkt auf der Hauptplatine verlötet und soll mit 128, 256 und 512 GByte Speicherplatz erscheinen. 545s kombiniert 3D-NAND mit SATA Ebenfalls „in Planung“ für das dritte Quartal 2017 ist die Intel SSD 545s, die als Schwestermodell der 540s im Mainstream-Bereich mit SATA-Schnittstelle ausgestattet ist. Gegenüber der 540s findet ein Wechsel von 2D-TLC-NAND auf 3D-TLC-NAND statt. Im 2,5-Zoll-Format steigt die Speicherkapazität auf bis zu 2 TByte an. Als M.2-Modul wird wie bei der 540s maximal 1 TByte geboten. 21 Kommentare Teilen auf Facebook: 1Teilen auf Twitter: 1Teilen auf Google+: 0  WhatsApp Themen: 3D-NAND Flash-Speicher Intel M.2 Massenspeicher SSD TLC Michael Günsch E-Mail … zeichnet auf ComputerBase für das Ressort Massenspeicher rund um SSDs und HDDs verantwortlich.

(AAPL), Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) 2 Bullish Trades for Target Corporation (TGT) Stock Earnings View All Posts With the U.S. presidential election dogging Wall Street’s heels, many stocks, especially tech stocks, are looking to bounce back after nine straight sessions of selling. Semiconductor giant Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has had it particularly rough, with INTC stock plunging more than 12% since mid-October. But will the election results bring relief or misery for INTC stock? Click to Enlarge First, let’s look at the technical picture. There has been little to cheer about with INTC’s stock price recently. In fact, the shares are trading at their lowest point since July, breaching key support at $34 on Friday. However, the shares are bouncing back this morning, and are on course to reclaim this technical level — an important development for Intel stock bulls that could be a precursor to a rally back toward $36. That said, even if INTC falls post-election, support is rising into the area in the form of Intel’s 200-day moving average. This trendline is currently perched in the $32.50 region. July marks INTC stock’s last close below this moving average. Checking in on Intel stock’s sentiment backdrop, we find that the brokerage community is warming up to INTC. According to Thomson/First Call, 26 of the 41 analysts following Intel rate the shares a “buy” or better in November, up from 23 “buy” ratings last month. Furthermore, the 12-month consensus price target of $40.19 represents a 19.6% premium to Friday’s close. 7 A-Rated Cheap Stocks to Buy for Rapid-Fire Growth The situation is already improving rapidly on the options front. For instance, INTC stock’s November put/call open interest ratio has fallen to a reading of 0.43 after rising heading into last month’s earnings report. Calls also more than double puts among options set to expire at the end of this week, with the weekly Nov. 11 put/call open interest ratio arriving at 0.47. Overall, weekly Nov. 11 series implieds are pricing in a potential move of about 3.75% by the end of the week, placing the upper bound at $34.86 and the lower bound at $32.34. The upper bound is just shy of resistance in the $35-$36 region, though follow-through buying should help push INTC stock nearer to $36 by the time monthly November options expire. On the downside, support in the $32.50 region, and Intel’s 200-day moving average, should stall any post-election jitters.

Called Shooting Star, the drone can be programmed to fly as part of a swarm which is able to be controlled by just one pilot from a single computer. Intel says that using its Shooting Star drone will allow lightshows that might once have taken weeks to be created in "a matter of days" thanks to its companion software and animation interface. Rather than animators manually calculating where and when each drone has to be in order to create a particular image, Intel has created algorithms which are able to automate the animation creation process.  Strength in numbers These algorithms take an image, calculate the number of drones needed, determine where they should be placed and formulate the fastest path they can take to create the image. With built-in LED lights that are able to create over 4 billion color combinations, it's safe to say animators will have the freedom to get creative, just as long as they don't want to create a show longer than the drone's twenty minute battery life.  To keep things orgainsed, the software is able to check the status of each drone in a fleet and prioritise the use of those with the greatest battery life and GPS reception.  Of course, safety has to be considered with drones that are designed to be used in close proximity to the public - we all saw what happened to Enrique Iglesias. To prevent damage to the drone or people in the event of an accident, Intel has constructed the Shooting Star with a soft, light frame made of flexible plastics and foam, and has encased its propellers in cages. Intel hasn't revealed a price point for the Shooting Star, or whether it will be made available to the public, so you'll have to sit on those plans for a magnificent Holiday light show for now.  Considering Intel had to get FAA approval to fly its drones in a 500 strong swarm in order to break a Guinness World Record recently, it's unlikely that we'll see Shooting Star light shows outside of professional events any time soon. This is a big achievement for Intel in the area of drone fleet control, showing that large numbers of drones can perform complex tasks in unison under the control of only one person. Such technology could be useful to a variety of industries, not just entertainment, and could even prove useful in transporting large items or assisting in search and rescue missions.  You can see Intel's Guinness World Record setting Shooting Star light show in action below: Fancy a drone?

Intel has ramped up its drone program and in October it unveiled the Falcon 8+ drone aimed at commercial applications. Today Intel has officially announced its next drone called the Intel Shooting Star Drone and it is made specifically for light shows. Intel used a fleet of Shooting Star drones in Germany to set a world record for having the most UAVs in the air at the same time. In that record setting event there were 500 Shooting Star drones in the sky at on time, massively outdoing the 200 drones used in the Palm Springs light show. Having 500 drones in the air allowed Intel to grab the Guinness World Record for UAVs in the air at once. The Shooting Star drone is the first drone made just for light shows and has a light-weight construction with “virtually limitless color combinations” according to Intel. Intel has also worked with the FAA to get a Part 107 Waiver to fly as a fleet with one pilot at night in the US. Intel says that it will be using the Shooting Star drones publicly soon. The Shooting Star drone is a quadcopter with encased rotors. It measures 384 x 384 x 93mm and has a 6-inch rotor diameter. Maximum takeoff weight is 280g and flight time is up to 20 minutes. Maximum range is 1.5km. The drones can fly in wind speeds up to 10m/s and the maximum speed in GPS mode is 10 m/s with maximum light show airspeed of 3 m/s. The integrated LEDs can create over 4 billion color combinations using red, green, blue, and white LEDs. The special software interface allows the creation of a lightshow in days instead of weeks. Intel plans to expand the system to work with more drones in the future.

The company better known for computer chips than flying machines showed off its new “Shooting Star” drone – or 500 of them to be precise – in a video (above) posted recently on YouTube. Setting a new Guinness World Record for having the most drones airborne at any one time, Intel sent its fleet of machines skyward for a special performance at a venue near Munich, Germany. The Shooting Star drone used in the display is a small, lightweight (just 280 grams) quadcopter featuring propellor cages, presumably in case a software glitch sends the machines plummeting en masse into a watching crowd. You only have to cast your mind back to Enrique Iglesias’s drone-related mis-step to imagine the kind of carnage that could ensue. Related: Watch this dazzling “drone ballet” in front of Japan’s Mount Fuji Displays using Intel’s specially created flight control system can be operated by just one person using software on a single computer that’s controlling the performance. “The fleet is easily programmed, assembled and operated to create beautifully choreographed images in the nighttime sky for an amazing new entertainment experience,” Intel said. The company explains that its proprietary algorithms allow it to “automate the animation creation process by using an image and quickly calculating the number of drones needed, determining where drones should be placed and formulating the fastest path to create the image in the sky.” Last year Intel managed to get 100 drones into the sky at the same time, with the company’s Natalie Cheung commenting that the more complex 500-drone performance would’ve been impossible to achieve then. “It’s been an amazing experience just to see the technology develop so quickly,” Cheung said. The entertainment-focused drone system has even been green-lighted by the Federal Aviation Administration, allowing for the possibility of public displays in the U.S., something the company says it hopes to do soon. Related: Watching “umbrella drones” take to the sky is weirdly beautiful After missing out on the mobile revolution, Intel is working hard to ensure it performs better in the fast-expanding drone market. The chipmaker has said it’s keen to position itself “at the forefront of this opportunity to increasingly integrate the computing, communications, sensor, and cloud technology required to make drones smarter and more connected.” Its new Shooting Star copter showcases some of these technologies, with the company particularly interested in developing systems that can help drones fly with total awareness of their environment.
Experiments in program optimisation A bug story: data alignment on x86 Tags: C optimisation alignment 06 Nov 2016 I once had to calculate a sum of a vector of integers. This sounds unusual. Who ever wants to do this in real life? Normally, we only see code like this as primary school assignments or compiler benchmarks. However, this time it happened in real life. Well, the actual task was to verify the IP header checksum, which is a ones’ complement sum of two-byte words. Simply speaking, it means adding together all the words and all the carry bits produced in the process. This procedure has several nice features: it can be done very efficiently using the ADC processor instruction (unfortunately, this feature is not accessible from C) it can be done on any size words (you can add eight-byte values if you wish, as long as you reduce the result to two bytes and add all the overflow bits together) it is insensitive to the endianness of the processor (very surprising, but true). There was one important requirement: the input data was not aligned (the IP frames as received by hardware or read from a file). I didn’t have to bother about portability, as the only platform the code had to run was Intel x64 (Linux and GCC 4.8.3). Intel has no restrictions on the alignment of integer operands (an unaligned access used to be slow, but isn’t any more), and, since the endianness was not important, the little-endian case was also all right. So I quickly wrote: _Bool check_ip_header_sum (const char * p, size_t size)
{
    const uint32_t * q = (const uint32_t *) p;
    uint64_t sum = 0;

    sum += q[0];
    sum += q[1];
    sum += q[2];
    sum += q[3];
    sum += q[4];

    for (size_t i = 5; i < size / 4; i++) {
        sum += q[i];
    }

    do {
        sum = (sum & 0xFFFF) + (sum >> 16);
    } while (sum & ~0xFFFFL);

    return sum == 0xFFFF;
} The source code and assembly output can be found in the repository. The most common size of an IP header is 20 bytes (5 double words, which I’ll call simply words) – that’s why the code looks like this. In addition, the size can never be less than that – this is checked before calling this function. Since IP header can never be longer than 15 words, the number of loop iterations is between 0 and 10. This indeed isn’t portable – accessing arbitrary memory using pointers to 32-bit values is known to fail on some processors, such as most, if not all, RISC ones. However, as I said before, I never expected this to be an issue on x86. And, of course (otherwise there wouldn’t have been a story to tell), the reality proved me wrong, as this code crashed with a SIGSEGV. A simplification The crash only happened when the loop was actually executed, which means that the headers were longer than 20 bytes. In real life this might be very rare case, but I was lucky as my test data contained such headers. Let’s simplify our code to only contain this loop. We’ll write it in plain C and split it in two files to avoid inlining. Here is sum.c: #include <stdlib.h> #include <stdint.h> 
uint64_t sum (const uint32_t * p, size_t nwords)
{
    uint64_t res = 0;
    size_t i;
    for (i = 0; i < nwords; i++) res += p [i];
    return res;
} and here is main.c: #include <stdint.h> #include <stdio.h> 
extern uint64_t sum (const uint32_t * p, size_t nwords);

char x [100];

int main (void)
{
    size_t i;
    for (i = 0; i < sizeof (x); i++) x [i] = (char) i;

    for (i = 0; i < 16; i++) {
        printf ("Trying %d sum\n", (int) i);
        printf ("Done: %d\n", (int) sum ((const uint32_t*) (x + i), 16));
    }
    return 0;
} This code SIGSEGV’s inside sum when i equals 1. The investigation The code of the sum function is surprisingly long, so I’ll only show the main loop: .L13:
        movdqa   (%r8), %xmm2
        addq     $1, %rdx
        addq     $16, %r8
        cmpq     %rdx, %r9
        pmovzxdq %xmm2, %xmm1
        psrldq   $8, %xmm2
        paddq    %xmm0, %xmm1
        pmovzxdq %xmm2, %xmm0
        paddq    %xmm1, %xmm0
        ja       .L13 The compiler was clever. Too clever, if you ask me. It used SSE (it was allowed to do so, because I used it elsewhere and had -msse4.2 in my command line). This code reads four values at a time (movdqa), then converts them to 64-bit format in two registers (two pmovzxdq instructions and a psrldq) and adds to the current sum (%xmm0). After the loop it adds the accumulated values together. This looks like a valid optimisation for the case when the word count is big, which is not our case. The compiler has no way to establish the typical number of loop iterations, that’s why it optimises for the highest benefits, correctly concluding that when the word count is small, so is the loss from the excessive optimisation. We’ll test later if there is such a loss and how big it is. What can possibly crash in this code? We quickly establish that it is that movdqa instruction. Just like most of SSE instructions that access memory, it requires 16-byte alignment of the source argument address. But we can’t expect such alignment from the uint32_t pointer, so how could this instruction be used at all? The compiler actually takes care of the alignment. Before running the loop, it calculates how many words must be processed before the loop starts:         testq   %rsi, %rsi   ; %rsi is n
        je      .L14
        movq    %rdi, %rax   ; %rdi is p
        movq    %rsi, %rdx
        andl    $15, %eax
        shrq    $2, %rax
        negq    %rax
        andl    $3, %eax Or, in more conventional notation,     if (nwords == 0) return 0;
    unsigned start_nwords = (- (((unsigned)p & 0x0F) >> 2)) & 3; This produces 0 if p ends with 0, 1, 2, or 3 in hex, 3 if it ends with 4 to 7, 2 for 8 to B and 1 for C to F. After these first words have been processed, we can run the loop (provided that the number of remaining words is at least 4, and taking care of the leftovers). In short, this code aligns the pointer to 16, but only provided that it is already aligned by 4. Suddenly, our x86 behaves just like RISC: it crashes when a pointer to uint32_t is not aligned by 4. Simple fixes do not work No simple manipulation with this function resolves the problem. We can, for instance, declare the p parameter as char* as a naïve attempt to “explain to the compiler the arbitrary nature of the pointer”: uint64_t sum0 (const char * p, size_t nwords)
{
    const uint32_t * q = (const uint32_t *) p;
    uint64_t res = 0;
    size_t i;
    for (i = 0; i < nwords; i++) res += q [i];
    return res;
} Or, we can replace indexing with the pointer arithmetic: uint64_t sum01 (const uint32_t * p, size_t n)
{
  uint64_t res = 0;
  size_t i;
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) res += *p++;
  return res;
} or do both: uint64_t sum02 (const char * p, size_t n)
{
  uint64_t res = 0;
  size_t i;
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++, p += sizeof (uint32_t))
    res += *(const uint32_t *) p;
  return res;
} Neither of these modifications help. The compiler is clever enough to get rid of all the syntax sugar and reduce the code to basics. All these versions crash with SIGSEGV. What the standard says This seems like a rather nasty trick of the compiler. The transformation it performed on the program contradicts to the usual expectations of a programmer who is used to x86. Is the compiler actually allowed to do this? To answer this, we’ll have to look at the standard. I’m not going to dive deep into various standards of C and C++. Let’s look at one of them, that of C99, or, more specifically, at the latest publicly available version of the C99 standard (2007). It introduces the concept of alignment: 3.2 alignment requirement that objects of a particular type be located on storage boundaries with addresses that are particular multiples of a byte address This concept is used when defining pointer conversion: 6.3.2.3 A pointer to an object or incomplete type may be converted to a pointer to a different object or incomplete type. If the resulting pointer is not correctly aligned for the pointed-to type, the behavior is undefined. Otherwise, when converted back again, the result shall compare equal to the original pointer. When a pointer to an object is converted to a pointer to a character type, the result points to the lowest addressed byte of the object. Successive increments of the result, up to the size of the object, yield pointers to the remaining bytes of the object. And also when talking about pointer dereferencing: 6.5.3.2 Address and indirection operators If an invalid value has been assigned to the pointer, the behavior of the unary * operator is undefined.87) 87) Among the invalid values for dereferencing a pointer by the unary * operator are a null pointer, an address inappropriately aligned for the type of object pointed to, and the address of an object after the end of its lifetime. If I understand these clauses correctly, converting pointers in general (except for converting anything to char *) is a dangerous business. The program is allowed to crash right there, during conversion. Alternatively, conversion may succeed, but produce invalid value that causes crash (or rubbish as a result) during dereferencing. In our case, either may happen if the alignment requirement for uint32_t enforced by this compiler is different from one (the alignment for the char*). Since the most natural alignment for uint32_t is 4, the compiler was completely correct. The sum0 version, although it does not resolve the problem, is still better than the original sum: the latter required the pointer to be of the uint32_t* type already, which required a pointer conversion in the calling code. This conversion may crash immediately, or produce an invalid pointer value. Let’s move the responsibility to deal with the alignment to the sum function, and, therefore, replace sum with sum0. These standard clauses explain why our attempts to fix the problem by playing with the types of pointers and the way they are calculated fail. No matter what we do to the pointer, eventually it is converted to uint32_t*, which immediately signals to the compiler that the pointer is four-aligned. There are only two solutions that work. Disabling the SSE The first isn’t really a solution – rather, a workaround. On x86 the alignment problems only happen when using SSE, so let’s disable it. We can do it for the entire file where sum is declared, or, if this isn’t practical, only for that function: __attribute__ ((target("no-sse")))
uint64_t sum1 (const char * p, size_t nwords)
{
    const uint32_t * q = (const uint32_t *) p;
    uint64_t res = 0;
    size_t i;
    for (i = 0; i < nwords; i++) res += q [i];
    return res;
} This code is even less portable than the original one, since it uses a GCC-specific and Intel-specific attribute. This can be rectified by appropriate conditional compiling: #if defined (__GNUC__) && (defined (__x86_64__) || defined (__i386__)) __attribute__ ((target ("no-sse")))
#endif However, this isn’t really of much help, since all it does is make the program compile on other compilers and other architectures, but not necessarily work there. It may still crash if the target processor is RISC, or if the compiler uses some other syntax to disable SSE. Even if we keep within the limits of GCC and Intel, who can promise that another architecture, not called SSE, won’t be introduced ten years from now? After all, my original code could have been written 20 years ago when there was no SSE around (the first MMX is 1997). Still, this program produces very nice code: sum0:
        testq   %rsi, %rsi
        je      .L34
        leaq    (%rdi,%rsi,4), %rcx
        xorl    %eax, %eax
.L33:
        movl    (%rdi), %edx
        addq    $4, %rdi
        addq    %rdx, %rax
        cmpq    %rcx, %rdi
        jne     .L33
        ret
.L34:
        xorl    %eax, %eax
        ret This is exactly the code I had in mind when writing the function. I expect this code to run faster than the SSE-based one for small vector sizes, which is our case with IP. We’ll perform measurements later. Using the memcpy Another approach is to use memcpy. This function can copy the bytes representing a number into a variable of the corresponding type, no matter what the alignment is. And it does this in fully standard-compliant way. This may seem inefficient, and 20 years ago it really was. These days, however, it doesn’t have to be implemented as a procedure call at all; the compiler can treat it as an intrinsic, and replace with a memory-to-register load. The GCC definitely does. It compiles the following code uint64_t sum2 (const char * p, size_t nwords)
{
    uint64_t res = 0;
    size_t i;
    uint32_t temp;
    for (i = 0; i < nwords; i++) {
        memcpy (&temp, p + i * sizeof (uint32_t), sizeof (temp));
        res += temp;
    }
    return res;
} into the code similar to the original SSE one, except it uses movdqu instead of movdqa. This instruction allows misaligned data; its performance varies. On some processors it is much slower than movdqa even when the data is actually aligned. On others it runs at virtually the same speed. Another difference in the generated code is that it doesn’t even try to align the pointer. It uses movdqu on the original pointer even if it could align it and then use movdqa. This means that this code, being more universal, may end up slower than original code on some inputs. This solution is completely portable, for it can be used everywhere, even on RISC architectures. Combined solution The first solution seems to be faster on our data (although we haven’t measured it yet), while the second one is more portable. We can combine the two: #if defined (__GNUC__) && (defined (__x86_64__) || defined (__i386__)) __attribute__ ((target ("no-sse")))
#endif uint64_t sum3 (const char * p, size_t nwords)
{
    uint64_t res = 0;
    size_t i;
    uint32_t temp;
    for (i = 0; i < nwords; i++) {
        memcpy (&temp, p + i * sizeof (uint32_t), sizeof (temp));
        res += temp;
    }
    return res;
} This code will be compiled into a nice non-SSE loop on GCC/Intel, but will still produce a working (and fairly good) code on other architectures. This is the version I’m going to use in my project. The code it produces for x86 is identical to that of sum1. Measuring speed We’ve seen that the compiler had full right to generate the code with movdqa. Was it also a good decision from performance point of view? Let’s measure the speed of all our solutions. First, we’ll do it on fully aligned data (the pointer is aligned by 16). The figures are in nanoseconds per word added. Size, words sum0 (movdqa) sum1 (loop) sum2 (movdqu) sum3 (loop, memcpy) 1 2.91 1.95 2.90 1.94 5 0.84 0.79 0.77 0.79 16 0.46 0.45 0.41 0.46 1024 0.24 0.46 0.26 0.48 65536 0.24 0.45 0.24 0.45 This table confirms that on the very small word count (1) the ordinary loops run faster than the SSE-based versions, although the difference isn’t really very big (1 ns per word, and there is only one word). The SSE wins on big word counts (1024 and more), and here the overall benefit may be big. The speeds are almost equal, with a small advantage of SSE (movdqu) on medium-sized inputs (such as 16). Let’s run the test for all the values between 1 and 16 and check where the break-even point is. The sum1 (non-SSE loop) and sum3 versions show very similar times (which is to be expected since the code is identical; the time differences demonstrate the measurement accuracy of about 0.02 ns). That’s why we’ll only include the final version (sum3): We see that the simple loops win over SSE versions up to the word count of 3, after which the SSE versions start to take over (the movdqu version, as a rule, being faster than the original movdqa). I think that, without any additional information, a compiler is right in assuming that an arbitrary loop will execute more than three times, so its decision to use SSE was completely correct. But why didn’t it go straight for movdqu option? Is there any reason to do movdqa at all? We’ve seen that when the data is aligned, movdqu version runs at the same speed as movdqa on big word counts, and runs faster on small ones. The latter can be explained by fewer instructions that precede the loop (no need to test alignment). What happens if we run the test on misaligned data? Here are the times for some options: Size, words Offset 0 Offset 1 Offset 4 movdqa movdqu loop movdqu loop movdqa movdqu loop</tr> 1 2.91 2.90 1.94 2.93 1.94 2.90 2.90 1.94 5 0.84 0.77 0.79 0.77 0.79 0.84 0.79 0.78 16 0.46 0.41 0.46 0.42 0.46 0.52 0.40 0.46 1024 0.24 0.26 0.48 0.26 0.51 0.25 0.25 0.47 65536 0.24 0.24 0.45 0.25 0.50 0.24 0.24 0.46 As we see, alignment introduces only slight variations in the times, except for one: movdqa version becomes a bit slower (0.52 ns instead of 0.46) at offset 4, size 16. The direct loop is still the best solution on small word counts; movdqu is the best on big ones. The compiler wasn’t right using movdqa. A possible explanation is that it is optimising for an older model of the Intel processor. The movdqu instruction used to work quite a bit slower than movdqa on Xeon processors, even on fully aligned data. It looks like this isn’t the case any more, so the compiler can be simplified (and the alignment requirements relaxed). The original function The original function that checks IP headers must now be re-written like this: #if defined (__GNUC__) && (defined (__x86_64__) || defined (__i386__)) __attribute__ ((target ("no-sse")))
#endif _Bool check_ip_header_sum (const char * p, size_t size)
{
    const uint32_t * q = (const uint32_t *) p;
    uint32_t temp;
    uint64_t sum = 0;

    memcpy (&temp, &q [0], 4); sum += temp;
    memcpy (&temp, &q [1], 4); sum += temp;
    memcpy (&temp, &q [2], 4); sum += temp;
    memcpy (&temp, &q [3], 4); sum += temp;
    memcpy (&temp, &q [4], 4); sum += temp;

    for (size_t i = 5; i < size / 4; i++) {
        memcpy (&temp, &q [i], 4);
        sum += temp;
    }

    do {
        sum = (sum & 0xFFFF) + (sum >> 16);
    } while (sum & ~0xFFFFL);

    return sum == 0xFFFF;
} If we’re scared of converting an unaligned pointer to uint32_t* (the standard talks about an undefined behaviour), it must look like this: #if defined (__GNUC__) && (defined (__x86_64__) || defined (__i386__)) __attribute__ ((target ("no-sse")))
#endif _Bool check_ip_header_sum (const char * p, size_t size)
{
    uint32_t temp;
    uint64_t sum = 0;

    memcpy (&temp, p, 4); sum += temp;
    memcpy (&temp, p + 4, 4); sum += temp;
    memcpy (&temp, p + 8, 4); sum += temp;
    memcpy (&temp, p + 12, 4); sum += temp;
    memcpy (&temp, p + 16, 4); sum += temp;

    for (size_t i = 20; i < size; i+= 4) {
        memcpy (&temp, p + i, 4);
        sum += temp;
    }

    do {
        sum = (sum & 0xFFFF) + (sum >> 16);
    } while (sum & ~0xFFFFL);

    return sum == 0xFFFF;
} Both versions look very ugly, especially the second one. Both remind me of writing in pure assembly. However, this is the correct way of writing portable C. Interestingly, even though we’ve established that the loop runs at the same speed as movdqu on the word count of 5, re-writing the function as one loop from 0 to size makes it slower (typical times are 0.48 ns and 0.83 ns per word). The C++ version C++ allows us to write the same function in much more readable way by employing some template programming. We’ll introduce a generic type called const_unaligned_pointer: template<typename T> class const_unaligned_pointer
{
    const char * p;
public:
    const_unaligned_pointer () : p (0) {}
    const_unaligned_pointer (const void * p) : p ((const char*)p) {}
    T operator* () const
    {
        T tmp;
        memcpy (&tmp, p, sizeof (T));
        return tmp;
    }
    const_unaligned_pointer operator+ (ptrdiff_t d) const
    {
       return const_unaligned_pointer (p + d * sizeof (T));
    }
    T operator[] (ptrdiff_t d) const { return * (*this + d); }
}; This is just a skeleton. The real definition must include equality test, a “minus” operator for two pointers, a “plus” operator in other direction, some conversions and, probably, other stuff. This type allows our function to look very close to the version we started with: bool check_ip_header_sum (const char * p, size_t size)
{
    const_unaligned_pointer<uint32_t> q (p);
    uint64_t sum = 0;

    sum += q[0];
    sum += q[1];
    sum += q[2];
    sum += q[3];
    sum += q[4];

    for (size_t i = 5; i < size / 4; i++) {
        sum += q[i];
    }

    do {
        sum = (sum & 0xFFFF) + (sum >> 16);
    } while (sum & ~0xFFFFL);

    return sum == 0xFFFF;
} This code produces exactly the same assembly as the code with memcpy and, obviously, runs at the same speed. Some more templates Our code only reads unaligned data, so the const_unaligned_pointer class is sufficient. What if we wanted to write it as well? We can make a class for that too, but in this case we need two classes: one for a pointer and one for the l-value produced while dereferencing this pointer: template<typename T> class unaligned_ref
{
    void * p;
public:
    unaligned_ref (void * p) : p (p) {}

    T operator= (const T& rvalue)
    {
        memcpy (p, &rvalue, sizeof (T));
        return rvalue;
    }

    operator T() const
    {
        T tmp;
        memcpy (&tmp, p, sizeof (T));
        return tmp;
    }
};

template<typename T> class unaligned_pointer
{
    char * p;
public:
    unaligned_pointer () : p (0) {}
    unaligned_pointer (void * p) : p ((char*)p) {}
    unaligned_ref<T> operator* () const { return unaligned_ref<T> (p); }
    unaligned_pointer operator+ (ptrdiff_t d) const
    {
        return unaligned_pointer (p + d * sizeof (T));
    }
    unaligned_ref<T> operator[] (ptrdiff_t d) const { return *(*this + d); }
}; Again, this code just demonstrates the idea; much more is needed to make it suitable for production use. Let’s try a simple test: char mem [5];

void dump ()
{
    std::cout << (int) mem [0] << " " << (int) mem [1] << " "
              << (int) mem [2] << " " << (int) mem [3] << " "
              << (int) mem [4] << "\n";
}

int main (void)
{
    dump ();
    unaligned_pointer<int> p (mem + 1);
    int r = *p;
    r++;
    *p = r;
    dump ();
    return 0;
} Here is the output: 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0
 We could have written     ++ *p; but this requires defining operator++ in unaligned_ref. The generated code looks very good:         call    _Z4dumpv
        addl    $1, mem+1(%rip)
        call    _Z4dumpv Conclusions Alignment issues are not only relevant for RISC processors. SSE makes them valid for x86, too (in both 32 and 64-bit mode). In our case the compiler was correct in using SSE in the generated code. However, it could have used an unaligned access – not only would it be more robust, it also would be faster (and would mask the problem, so that the program would crash some other time). There is a benefit in writing the code as portable as is practically possible: your own processor may suddenly start behaving like a totally different one. There is a lot of code lying around, which was written twenty years ago and only ever ran on Intel. This code may suddenly crash in a similar fashion. One practical advice is to disable all possible instruction set extensions while compiling such code – however, even that may turn out insufficient. This story demonstrates that there is something useful in code coverage tools. Here I was lucky that the input data caused all the code to execute. It might be different some other time. Update On /r/cpp on reddit, OldWolf2 pointed out that the checksum code contained a bug, in the last line:     } while (sum & ~0xFFFFL); He is correct: 0xFFFFL has type unsigned long, which is not necessarily the same as uint64_t. A long might be 32 bits, in which case the bit inversion would happen before expansion to 64 bits, and the actual constant used in the test would be 0x00000000FFFF0000. It is easy to construct an input where such test would fail – for instance, for the array of two words: 0xFFFFFFFF and 0x00000001. We can either perform bit inversion after cast:     } while (sum & ~(uint64_t) 0xFFFF); or use comparison instead:     } while (sum > 0xFFFF); Interestingly, GCC produces shorter code in the second case. Here is the version with the bit test: .L15:
        movzwl  %ax, %edx
        shrq    $16, %rax
        addq    %rdx, %rax

Tweet TEHRAN (FNA)- It looks like product renders of the Windows-powered smartphone Dell was working on have surfaced, courtesy of trusted tipster Evan Blass. The photo shows what appears to be the phone that Dell was reportedly supposed to outfit an Intel processor with, in the same vein as those powering laptops out in the market today. When Evan Blass first posted the photo, many falsely assumed that it was the much-anticipated Surface Phone by Microsoft, but it wasn't. The photo actually shows the smartphone Dell was developing, "was" being the operative word here, since development was allegedly cancelled, so don't hold your breath for a Dell smartphone powered by an x86 Intel processor able to run Windows legacy software instead of miniature mobile counterparts. Specifications of the cancelled phone are scant, but the processor's x86 architecture speaks volumes for what could have been possible. The x86 tidbit came from Thurrott, citing a source familiar with the phone. If development came through, we could have seen a smartphone packing probably the most powerful processor inside a mobile device in history. Dell was wise to collaborate with Windows on this, since Windows 10 Mobile readily supports Intel X86 processors. With Windows 10 on the cancelled device, Microsoft's Continuum feature could have taken advantage of the beefy specs. We know how the Continuum feature works with the HP Elite x3, which HP advertises as capable of the full desktop experience, a quality it owes largely to Continuum, a Windows 10 functionality that turns capable phones into desktops by virtue of connecting an external display, a dedicated keyboard and a mouse. Just imagine Continuum coupled with a powerful processor on a phone and you get a true and seamless non-disruptive desktop experience made possible by a tiny flagship. It almost eliminates the need for a separate laptop, making it easy to assume that if the phone came into realization, a laptop dock could have come bundled with it, ready to harness the power of the phone's chip. It's up for discussion why the phone couldn't push through, but a key contributor to this might be the cancellation of Intel's low-end segment as a restructuring move back in May, putting a lid on the production of Intel Atom processor for mobile devices. While the phone remains a pipe dream even with the product renders, Evan Blass is slated to share more details about it shortly, slapping on a "More than just a concept" teaser tag along with a photograph showing several of the Dell smartphone's features. .@tomwarren Much more than just a concept.

Intel unveils a drone made for aerial light shows Engadget 11/7/2016 Jon Fingas © Provided by Engadget Intel isn't just using drone swarms to show off its robotics prowess -- it's building a business around them. The chip maker has unveiled the Shooting Star, a quadcopter drone tailor-made for light shows. Its companion software automates the animation process, telling the drone horde where to fly to create an intended image -- it'll even choose drones based on remaining battery life and GPS reception quality. Light shows that took weeks to design can now be ready in a matter of days, Intel says. You only need one pilot to run everything, and the LED light at the heart of the drone can shine in any of 4 billion color combinations. The hardware is designed to minimize damage if there's ever an accident. It's built out of foam, flexible plastic and caged propellers that protect the human audience below. Shooting Star can fly in light rain, as well, so that big night won't be ruined by less-than-perfect weather.

If you're just flying solo, there are likely better options available that can fly longer than the Shooting Star's 20 minutes, and at higher speeds. However, there's no question that the technology could be very useful for entertainers. While it was a big deal when Intel flew 100 drones in a swarm early in 2016 (enough to set a Guinness World Record), Intel successfully flew 500 Shooting Star drones together in October. That's enough to create truly complex patterns that are more likely to awe crowds.

By Sarmistha Acharya November 7, 2016 08:18 GMT Intel unveils Shooting Star drone designed especially for light shows Intel Intel has just launched its first drone, dubbed the Intel Shooting Star drone, designed specifically for light shows. It is the company's first drone created for entertainment light shows. The company has got the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) approval to fly these drones as a fleet at night in the US, with one pilot manning the show. While the company did not divulge details, it said it is planning to use its new fleet of Star drones publicly soon. The new drone weighs only at 280gm or even less, almost equal to the weight of a volleyball. It is constructed with a soft frame made of flexible plastic and foams, without any screws. It features built-in LED lights that can create more than four billion colour combinations based on RGBW LED. The drone contains an improved software and animation interface allowing a light show that can be created in a few days. The company recently put the fleet of Shooting Star drones to test in Germany and successfully set a Guinness World Record for the most UAVs airborne simultaneously with 500 Shooting Star drones on 7 October. All the drones were controlled by a pilot. With the new fleet of 500 drones, the company outdid its own record set less than a year ago for 100 drones flying simultaneously. The announcement was made by Anil Nanduri, vice president in the New Technology Group and general manager of the UAV segment at Intel, who said the company will continue to invest in drone technology. So far Intel has acquired MAVinci GmbH, a drone company based in Germany offering flight planning software. "It demonstrates how a large fleet of drones can communicate and complete complex tasks," said Natalie Cheung, drone light show business director for the UAV Group at Intel. "This technology can be used for entertainment or for putting ads in the sky." She said a fleet of drones could be used to meet industrial needs, and that of search and rescue missions. Daniel Gurdan, the engineering lead for Intel Shooting Star drones, explained Shooting Star drones fly automatically, while maintaining stability in wind speeds of up to 33ft per second. "The flight controller is highly precise, very robust in gusty conditions and has proven reliability," Gurdan said. The earlier Drone 100 light show took about five months to build and required more than 15 people to manage. In the Shooting Star system the light show system can be ready in just a few days and needs only a handful of people or just an operator to manage. "The FAA approved Intel Shooting Star drones after reviewing the systems' protocols and safety implementation guidelines," said Cheung. "We're showing regulators around the world that UAV technologies used the right ways can help shape new rules for manned and unmanned aerial vehicles," added Cheung.

The company, which put its own drone swarms in the air around the world in 2015, has come out with another model — one with a software that will help a drone create an intended image. The software will even choose drones based on GPS reception quality and remaining battery life. This drone could help design elaborate light shows in a shorter duration.  Related Stories India, US Close In On Predator Drone Aircraft Deal Intel Acquires Voke VR Startup As It Moves Into Immersive Sports “With this drone, we will be able to demonstrate that drone light shows can redefine entertainment and create amazing new experiences in the night sky. ” Anil Nanduri, vice president, new technology group, and general manager UAV segment, Intel Corporation, said in the official press release. To design the Shooting Star, Intel has received a Part 107 waiver from the federal aviation administration (FAA), which will let the drone fly outside the regular limit for such devices. The company has equipped it with an LED, which can shine in 4 million different combinations.  One of the standout features of the drone is its form factor — it weighs just 280 grams and has a rotor diameter of 6 inches. It can also fly for about 20 minutes in light rain.  The company announced its developer-focused Intel Aero platform and Intel Aero ready-to-fly drone in August, expected to be available by 2016-end, according to its website. In October, it introduced the Falcon 8+ system — a multirotor drone with complete flight system redundancies built in.  Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

As a loyal Apple customer since 2004, I have to say that the fresh release of this year’s MacBook Pro has me excited. I am upgrading my system for the first time in three years; I generally upgrade computers, especially Mac laptops every three years or so; this helps with resale value and keeps hardware current to match the often-updated macOS software and ever-growing system requirements as technology continues to evolve. First… Design 2016 marks the first year you can grab a MacBook Pro in the Cupertino company’s popular Space Gray. The company’s marketing materials boast that the device is 17 percent thinner after the redesign. The keyboard has been overhauled to adopt a second-gen version of their butterfly mechanism, the first version of which debuted with last year’s ultra-thin, Retina display MacBook. There is less movement happening beneath each keystroke, yet early reviews find the increased key stability and tactile feel appealing, with one reviewer (YouTube user DetroitBORG who provided a comprehensive video review) remarking favorably about improved typing speed and accuracy, as well as the updated backlighting system: <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IXBD_Ex4h8Y?start=384&#038;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> The trackpad has doubled in size, of course still sporting the Force Touch feature that simulates pressing a physical button through “taptic” motors; the trackpad itself is solid state, however, and there is no actual button beneath it. In addition, the speakers are dramatically louder, as well as a doubled dynamic range, louder bass, and direct link to system power, increasing peak power by up to three times (according to Apple). Ports / Connectivity Much to the chagrin of many, Apple’s continuing trend of homogenizing ports for the sake of thinness (and arguably to commodify connectivity with the necessity of adapters for peripherals) has come to fruition in this new MacBook Pro. There are four Thunderbolt 3 ports which each carry an extremely snappy 80 GB/sec throughput and can each provide power to the computer with the provided charger. Many were sad to see the famous MagSafe connector go, which the company touted for the first time in conjunction with the first-generation MacBook Pro in 2006. The benefit of the connector was the safety of your multi-thousand dollar machine from being yanked to the ground. Not to worry, however; third-party accessory makers have already shown a MagSafe-like fitting for the USB-C charging cable which allows for the same peace of mind. With all this said, Apple has decided to keep the traditional one-eighth-inch audio out jack in lieu of a Lightning connector. On the flipside, this makes the only two types of connections on the chassis the aforementioned Thunderbolt 3/USB-C and audio out. The USB-C port, seen here on a tablet, has been coupled with Apple’s Thunderbolt 3 standard for the new MacBook Pro, which uses the port for charging and peripherals. [Image by ruslan117/iStock] Performance For the first time ever, the 15-inch MacBook Pro offers 2 TB storage as an option, with vastly improved read and write speed for both screen sizes (just over 3 GB/sec read and 2 GB/sec write). These models also sport sixth-generation Intel processors. Dual-core i5s/i7s for the 13-inch model (3.3 GHz clock speed at the top end) and quad-core i7s for the 15-inch model (2.9 GHz clock speed at max spec). There was some disappointment at the choice to use slightly-dated “Skylake” Intel processor silicon, released in late 2015. The newest processor rendition from Intel codenamed “Kaby Lake” is rumored not to grace the MacBook family until 2017). Graphics Graphics are another sore point for die-hard power users; this year’s unit has integrated Intel Iris Graphics (500 series) on the 13-inch models, AMD Radeon Pro 400 series graphics on the 15-inch models, supplemented by integrated Intel HD graphics chips. For the first time in the MacBook Pro, graphics memory is upgradable to 4 GB. The main criticism is that for the price point of the machine, even the highest-tier AMD chips fall short of expectations. Critics on Apple forums have decried that this component will not be able to handle emerging VR gaming. With that said, there is now the capability to use an eGPU (external Graphics Processing Unit) to enhance the notebook’s graphics muscle. The speed of the peripheral interface that Thunderbolt 3 provides can be viewed as a mainline to the system’s logic board; with the proper eGPU, graphics performance increases of tenfold or greater are attainable… however, this comes with significant extra cost, and the eGPU market is only just emerging; this will make early sticker prices for third-party graphics units quite high. Display The new Retina-class display is 67 percent brighter; the utilization of the P3 color standard broadens the MacBook Pro’s color gamut by 25 percent more than conventional RGB. This will prove very desirable for color-intensive professions such as film/video and design, which require ever-increasing creative precision. The Touch Bar is a new addition to the 2016 MacBook Pro, offering increased usability and context-sensitive functionality via a changing touchscreen display. [Image by Stephen Lam/Getty Images] The Touch Bar, Piece de Resistance The newest feature (announced with perhaps the greatest fanfare by Tim Cook and company), is the Touch Bar, a glass, multi-touch capable OLED touchscreen panel that replaces the traditional row of function keys (still an option on the base model). Powered by an independent ARM-based “T1” processor (most likely similar to the first-generation S1 architecture used in the original Apple Watch), the Touch Bar also runs watchOS. In short, this intuitive panel functions as a contextually-relevant features panel. Depending on the application you’re using, the Touch Bar will respond. Fine-tooth adjustments to a project in Logic Pro, a long line of Emoji options while using Messages, word suggestions while typing; the potential is limitless, especially when Apple has published information for its independent developers on their website. Expect third-party apps to immediately make use of this new paradigm. Price The starting price for the 15-inch MacBook Pro including the new Touch Bar is $2,399; a 20 percent uptick over the starting price of the previous generation, as reported by Gregg Keizer in Computerworld. The 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar also sees a 20 percent entry-price hike at $1,799. Keizer continues in his article that this is not unprecedented for Apple. The stable prices of the past few years saw a similar jump in 2012 with the introduction of the first Retina displays. Conclusion Overall, Apple has released what amounts to a significant redesign over its previous generation MacBook Pro. While there may be some disappointment among the user base regarding the underwhelming graphics and last-generation processor, the aforementioned expandability that Thunderbolt 3/USB-C provides, the implications the Touch Bar has for increased usability and productivity, the optimized keyboard setup and faster storage, and of course brighter, richer graphics all add up to a significant improvement over the precious generation for many loyal Apple customers. Stay tuned for a review once I get my hands on the 15-inch model just before Thanksgiving.

Despite strong circulars from Kohl’s, JCPenney, Sam’s Club, Costco, and BJ’s, the largest retailers — notably Walmart, Best Buy, and Target — have all been quiet. While they still may hold out a few more days, it is likely all of their ads will be leaked by Friday. You can see a full selection of the latest 2016 Black Friday ads at BestBlackFriday.com, but here are the recently released circulars from Staples, Bed Bath & Beyond, and Michaels. Disclaimer: The author, Phillip Dengler, is the owner of BestBlackFriday.com, which is referenced in this article. The Inquisitr holds no ownership. 2016 Staples Black Friday Ad [Image by Staples] Leaked on November 6, the 15-page Staples Black Friday ad features an assortment of desktop computers, laptops, printers, monitors, office furniture, and accessories. Staples will be closed on Thanksgiving this year, which is a policy that they implemented in 2015. Regardless, their online store will remain open on Turkey Day, and shoppers can make purchases and pick their order up anytime on Black Friday. Here are a few important facts about the sale. Doors Open at 6 a.m. on Friday Limit 1 Item Per Customer for Top Doorbusters HP Laptop wit Intel Core i5 Processor for $389.99 (save $250) HP Laptop with Intel Pentium Processor for $229.99 (save $190) HP Laptop with Intel Core i3 Processor for $299.99 (save $170) 5 Percent Back in Rewards on Everything Free Shipping for Orders over $14.99 You can see the entire 15-page Staples Black Friday 2016 ad at Savings.com. 2016 Bed Bath and Beyond Black Friday Ad [Image via Bed Bath & Beyond] Leaked on November 5, the 2-page Bed Bath & Beyond Black Friday ad only has a few deals this year. This is nothing new for them, as their ad last year was only a single page. Thanksgiving hours are going to depend on your specific location, but doors open on Black Friday at 6 a.m. Here are a few important facts about the sale. 20 Percent off Your Entire Purchase (Friday Only) Select Dyson Vacuums & Heater for up to $200 Off Save $30 on Keurig K55 Elite You can see the entire two-page Bed Bath & Beyond Black Friday 2016 ad at Savings.com. 2016 Michaels Black Friday Ad [Image via Michaels] Leaked on November 6, the 14-page Michaels Black Friday ad has an assortment of holiday-related items to get your home ready for Thanksgiving and Christmas. The sale begins early online on Thanksgiving at 4 a.m. EST. Retail stores will be open from 6 p.m. to midnight on Thanksgiving. On Black Friday, they will be open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. They are also extending the sale through Saturday, and they will be open from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. Here are a few important facts about the sale. 30 Percent off Your Entire Purchase on Thanksgiving with Code: THANKS1 30 Percent off Your Entire Purchase on Black Friday with Code: THANKS4 40 Percent off All Regular Price Purchase on Black Friday from Noon to 10 p.m. with Code: THANKS3 25 Percent off Entire Purchase on Saturday from 8 a.m. to Noon with Code: THANKS6 50 Percent off Any One Item on Saturday from Noon to 10 p.m. with Code: THANKS7 You can see the entire 14-page Michaels Black Friday 2016 ad at Savings.com. Walmart Black Friday 2016 Ad Update While the Walmart ad has not yet leaked, there is strong evidence that it will be released by the end of this upcoming week. Here are the dates over the past few years that Walmart’s ad has been released. 2012 – November 8 2013 – November 11 2014 – November 11 2015 – November 11 This upcoming week covers all of those dates, so Walmart’s ad should be out by Friday, November 11. Since Black Friday is earlier this year, November 25 compared to November 27 last year, it is unlikely Walmart would push their ad release back another week. Additionally, Walmart has already warned BestBlackFriday.com to not post their ad early. Traditionally, this notice comes a few days before the actual ad is going to be released, so it should be here soon. Expect it to come in the very early morning hours on November 10, with the possibility of it being pushed back to a little after midnight on November 11. As a reminder, Walmart’s website is currently hosting an “Early Bird” Pre-Black Friday sale, but you are better off waiting until Thanksgiving or Black Friday for the best deals.

A laptop-class Intel x86 processor was supposed to power the device, deftly harnessing the Continuum feature on Windows 10.  ( Evan Blass | Twitter ) Advertisement It looks like product renders of the Windows-powered smartphone Dell was working on have surfaced, courtesy of trusted tipster Evan Blass. The photo shows what appears to be the phone that Dell was reportedly supposed to outfit an Intel processor with, in the same vein as those powering laptops out in the market today. When Evan Blass first posted the photo, many falsely assumed that it was the much-anticipated Surface Phone by Microsoft, but it wasn't. The photo actually shows the smartphone Dell was developing, "was" being the operative word here, since development was allegedly cancelled, so don't hold your breath for a Dell smartphone powered by an x86 Intel processor able to run Windows legacy software instead of miniature mobile counterparts. Specifications of the cancelled phone are scant, but the processor's x86 architecture speaks volumes for what could have been possible. The x86 tidbit came from Thurrott, citing a source familiar with the phone. If development came through, we could have seen a smartphone packing probably the most powerful processor inside a mobile device in history. Dell was wise to collaborate with Windows on this, since Windows 10 Mobile readily supports Intel X86 processors. With Windows 10 on the cancelled device, Microsoft's Continuum feature could have taken advantage of the beefy specs. We know how the Continuum feature works with the HP Elite x3, which HP advertises as capable of the full desktop experience, a quality it owes largely to Continuum, a Windows 10 functionality that turns capable phones into desktops by virtue of connecting an external display, a dedicated keyboard and a mouse. Just imagine Continuum coupled with a powerful processor on a phone and you get a true and seamless non-disruptive desktop experience made possible by a tiny flagship. It almost eliminates the need for a separate laptop, making it easy to assume that if the phone came into realization, a laptop dock could have come bundled with it, ready to harness the power of the phone's chip. It's up for discussion why the phone couldn't push through, but a key contributor to this might be the cancellation of Intel's low-end segment as a restructuring move back in May, putting a lid on the production of Intel Atom processor for mobile devices. While the phone remains a pipe dream even with the product renders, Evan Blass is slated to share more details about it shortly, slapping on a "More than just a concept" teaser tag along with a photograph showing several of the Dell smartphone's features. .@tomwarren Much more than just a concept.

Intel did not waste any time and has already launched “Project Alloy”. Intel has acquired a small studio named Voke. Voke are the ones in charge with creating 360 degree content for public events such as basketball games or fashion events. A spokesperson for Intel stated that they bought Voke in hopes of accelerating their content creation process. The reason why Intel are interested in producing VR content is because first of all they can bring in some profits from that market, and second and most important reason is because the supply of VR content will increase VR headset sells. Intel are going to profit from people buying VR headsets because these headsets require quite a powerful PC, and most PC’s are powered by Intel CPUs. Intel has already started building a VR studio based in Los Angeles, and they have also purchased “Replay Technologies”. This company uses its freeD tech to present “bullet time” 360 degree replays of basketball matches in the NBA. All major tech companies are investing in virtual reality technology in hopes that the market will blow up. The only ones that are not involved in this movement is Apple. Sony are already selling their PS VR gaming headset, Microsoft announced that VR is going to come to Windows in 2017 and Lenovo, HP and Dell already have headsets on the market. If the virtual reality headset market blows up, Intel are surely going to profit off it, because they will provide both the content and the CPUs necessary. There have already been reports of huge profits from HTC which reportedly managed to sell over 140 thousand Vive headsets in just one month that cost $700 each. Oculus Rift have also stated in a report that their headsets have been used by one million people, and this was only in the month May.

Hedonistica I Watch Stuff The Superficial Home Videos Video Games Archives Send a Tip! Facebook Twitter Intel Flies 500 Light Show Drones Simultaneously To Set World Record November 8, 2016 View This is a video of Intel flying 500 computer controlled drones to set the new world record for most drones flown simultaneously (previously: their 100 drone light show army from last year). The drones, called Shooting Stars, were made specifically for use in light shows and have LEDs that can be programmed to turn any color. In this video, they use them to make a giant rainbow colored '500' and Intel logo in the sky, as well as mimic an alien invasion (or at least what I imagine one would look like). What a time to be alive. If I were one of those drones I would have gone rogue and started attacking all the other ones until they accepted me as their leader. That's how I know robots are going to kill us all. Like my grandma always used to say, "It only takes one bad apple to completely f*ck up a pie." Keep going for the video, but skip to 1:25 for the real action. Thanks to Gabe, who only wishes he could have been there with a bow and quiver full of foam-tipped arrows (safety first).

Intel also comes in above the median of analyst picks among the broader S&P 500 Index components, claiming the #158 spot out of 500. In forming this rank, the analyst opinions from the major brokerage houses were tallied, and averaged; then, the underlying components were ranked according to those averages. Investors often interpret analyst opinions from different angles — a popular analyst pick could mean that many sharp minds individually came to the same bullish conclusion, and therefore the stock should do well, but it could also mean that if the company stumbles, that would come as a negative surprise.

It can, of course, but a bullish investor could also take the contrarian angle and read into the data that there is lots of room for upside because the stock is so out of favor. 9 Dividend Stocks to Buy Now For these reasons, we at ETF Channel find value to putting together these rankings, because both the top and the bottom ends of the lists can often make for some interesting stock picking ideas for further research.

The UK government recently announced that it will invest £1.9 billion ($2.3 billion USD) in cybersecurity over the next five years, and that includes adoption of devices capable of FIDO authentication. Security By Default The UK government’s new strategy for “defensive” cybersecurity is to ensure that future devices that arrive on the market are “secure by default.” The recent massive DDoS attacks due to all the insecure IoT devices that come to market may have been one of reasons why the UK government chose this strategy. In its strategy document, the UK government said: [We will] invest in technologies like Trusted Platform Modules (TPM) and emerging industry standards such as Fast IDentity Online (FIDO), which do not rely on passwords for user authentication, but use the machine and other devices in the user’s possession to authenticate. The Government will test innovative authentication mechanisms to demonstrate what they can offer, both in terms of security and overall user experience. FIDO said that the UK government realized the same thing the group did--that passwords are an unsustainable method of authentication, something of which all the major data breaches in the past few years have reminded us. Ending "Security Fatigue" FIDO also noted that users want strong security to be accompanied by a positive user experience. As a recent NIST report concluded, users--especially in the enterprise environment--are starting to feel “security fatigue.” This is due to all the dozens of passwords they have to manage to get into the various applications that they need to use. The FIDO authentication methods promise to enable easy access to devices and applications through fingerprints, selfies, or a single touch of a security key. Authentication through facial recognition has had a bad track record, so it remains to be seen if FIDO’s implementation will be more resilient to attacks than previous facial recognition solutions. Fingerprints should offer reasonable security for most people, as long as governments don’t also decide to store everyone’s fingerprints in their hacking-prone databases, which could then expose everyone’s devices when a data breach happens. The FIDO Alliance is also enabling strong two-factor authentication, so ideally the biometric authentication will almost always be accompanied by some form of second-factor authentication as well, to better protect FIDO-enabled devices. The U.S. government has also been urging the move away from passwords, which it has called the “weakest link” in security.

I'm a senior citizen and my fingerprints as we normally see them are mostly gone. The last time I needed to submit fingerprints the system had a really difficult time reading them. I wonder if lack of fingerprints will be a pretty widespread problem. 1 anathema_forever Nov 7, 2016, 7:02 PM Fingerprints seem like a bad way to go anyway for the digital age. Database breaches getting peoples cheesy passwords, who are just a pet name etc aren't a huge loss. Depending on fingerprints and those getting lost is catastrophic so it would be best if we just didn't use them like that anymore. Easy to make massive and random digital keys so why even do that to ourselves. 1 Abbe Normal Nov 7, 2016, 7:50 PM If UK government supports some security technology for common use then you can bet it is already stuffed with government backdoors. Would you use the keylock that was recommended by a guy who broke into your house yesterday? :-) 0 targetdrone Nov 7, 2016, 10:13 PM Biometric security is a stupid idea because once compromised, that it's, game over. You can't change your fingerprints, or retinas , like you can with a password and authentication key. Don't think that information can't be hacked? Last Year over 5 million Federal employees and contractors has their fingerprints stolen during the Office of Personal Management data-breach. 2 rantoc Nov 8, 2016, 3:09 AM Yeah, once the biometric readings for a person is out then it would be an all out access to all sites who uses that said biometric (be it fingerprint, retina ect.). Its like having a single password on every site, once one is breached - Good luck! Until that "once breached your totally screwed" issue can be resolved, good luck getting my fingerprint as password - I don't like to give a clever hacked all out access once one site is hacked. Speaking ab out collecting ALL EGGS IN ONE BASKET... guess what basket WILL BE HACKED? 1 drajitsh Nov 8, 2016, 3:45 AM What we need is support on financial sites for password mangers. most sites disable them, especially for financial transactions. Practically, given enough time and effort any system can be hacked. If not through a choice vulnerability then an inside job. Putting all your eggs in one basket forever is not a good idea. 0 Joker41NAM Nov 8, 2016, 9:52 AM Anyone want to place bets on how long until the first major biometric authentication breach? (last gov one doesn't count, wasn't being used for authentication) 0 shiitaki Nov 8, 2016, 12:37 PM Replace passwords? Not likely! The government is pushing for biometrics? The government who lost millions of fingerprints in a data breach? The NSA are a bunch of self important jackasses and have little to contribute to the security of the world, more like they may be one of the greatest threats to out security with their backdoors being installed everywhere! Notice the NSA isn't asking congress for a backdoor in to hard drive encryption? The NSA wants to get rid of passwords because then they can't force you to hand over your data since only pins and password are protected under the constitution. The NSA getting rid of passwords is self serving! 0 maxwellmelon Nov 8, 2016, 12:58 PM its simple lets get a secure chip implant one in everyone arm, forehead. password problem solved. the solution was only predicted 2000 years ago. 0 kittle Nov 8, 2016, 5:48 PM when my passwords is stolen, i can change it and use a different one. I cant change my fingerprint. 0 pixelpusher220 Nov 8, 2016, 6:44 PM biometrics are fine. The reason is that we don't actually store the 'fingerprint'. it's a digital representation of that...which itself can be hashed and salted with a user specific salt. So you rehash/salt the input and now the value being tested is different so the hacker won't be able to authenticate. High level concept anyway, but that's how many systems work. 0 kittle Nov 8, 2016, 7:56 PM Anonymous said: biometrics are fine.

But how does the average user know when to do this, and HOW to do this? For password, i just click the 'forgot password' link and away I go. And whats to prevent the hacker from getting into the fingerprint reader and doing the same thing? 0 SillieAbbe Nov 8, 2016, 10:14 PM However nicely designed and implemented, devices, tokens, cards and phones are easily left behind, lost, stolen and abused. Then the remembered password would be the last resort. And, in a world where we live without remembered passwords, say, where our identity is established without our volitional participation, we would be able to have a safe sleep only when we are alone in a firmly locked room. It would be a Utopia for criminals but a Dystopia for most of us.

Firs it means the government can have access to your identity by simply physically forcing you to use your what everybody part, after all it is only something you know that is protected by the constitution, easier for the NSA. Second, you loose your phone and they have everything. People's biometrics can be faked, it's been done, and will only get better. Unlike a password, you can't change your biometrics, so once compromised it is for a long time. 0 ron baker Nov 9, 2016, 2:36 PM iTS JUST rubbing SALT into the wound ... Simple ... make bad security punishable by prison then all these companys will spend 100's Million to solve the problem.And never buy anything from Alibaba as you are handing over your details to buy cheap tat/apple gear. 0 cats_Paw Nov 10, 2016, 6:55 AM Good luck with that. The more common the security measures used, the more interest from hackers to break them. Government problems aside (Its the biggest threat as always, but its not gonna change so lets look at what we CAN change), there are 3 types of securities that work quite well: 1. Security thru obscurity: The system or method of encoding is complex enough that it cannot be done automatically and the hacker would need a lot of manual hacking time to get data. Example is creation of multiple fake files and folders that are corrupted files with no useful data but are heavily encoded, or using custom tools to create additional layers of security. 2. Offline. Best way, keep sensitive data offline. 3. Use OS/programs so unpopular that hackers do not have incentives to create hacking tools for them. 0 Display All 17 comments Comment Firstname Submit Most Popular Leaked Linkedin Passwords May Be Used In Active Email And Skype Phishing Campaigns BearSSL Joins Other Modern TLS Software Libraries To Make The Internet More Secure LastPass Becomes Free On Mobile, Eliminates Last Excuse For Not Using A Password Manager Tom's Hardware Around the World Tom's Hardware Around the World Russia France Germany UK Italy USA Subscribe to Tom's Hardware Search the site Ok About Tom's Hardware Advertising About us Contact Purch Privacy Policy Terms Of Use and Sale Copyright Policy Copyright © 2016 Purch Group, Inc.

Read more about the stories in today's news: Samsung Gear S3 Smartwatch Preorders Began Nov. 6 Huawei Launches Fit Sports and Fitness Watch Google and Sprint Launch RCS Messaging on Android Phones Intel Uses New Shooting Star Drones to Light Up the Sky       Today's topics include the start of preorders for the Samsung's Gear S3 Smartwatch on Nov. 6, the release of Huawei's newest fitness wearable, the launch of Google's Rich Communication Services messaging for Sprint Android phones and Intel's new drone that's designed specifically to display aerial light shows. Samsung started preorders on Nov. 6 for its latest Gear S3 Frontier and Classic smartwatches, which will be generally available for purchase on Nov. 18. The Gear S3 smartwatches, which start at $350, include the Frontier watch in two versions—a WiFi and Bluetooth model, and a WiFi, Bluetooth and LTE model—as well as the Classic model, which is equipped only with WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity. The Frontier model has more rugged styling while the Classic version looks more like a traditional digital watch and has a sleeker look that's designed to appeal to business professionals. Huawei has launched its latest wearable device, the $130 Huawei Fit sports watch, which provides multi-sport fitness tracking, heart rate and sleep monitoring, automatic step counting and more on a circular always-on display. Huawei designed the Fit to bridge the gap between a full smartwatch and a dedicated fitness tracker. The Huawei Fit has an aluminum body that comes in two finishes, Moonlight Silver and Titanium Grey. Three wrist band colors will be available—black, which is available exclusively at Best Buy through early January—blue and orange. Following the exclusive Best Buy arrangement, the devices will also be sold through Amazon, Newegg and other retailers. The Fit features a 1.04-inch circular black and white touch-screen display, 256KB of memory, 16MB of on-board storage and an 80mAh rechargeable battery that lasts up to six days on a charge with normal use. Google's efforts to push broad adoption of Rich Communication Services for cross-operator messaging on mobile devices appear to be gaining traction. The company announced on Nov. 4 that it has launched RCS messaging for Sprint customers that are using Android phones. The new support will allow Android users to conduct group chats, send high-resolution photos, receive and read receipts, and generally do more with chat than they currently are able to with standard Short Message Service. Sprint subscribers will see RCS support in Messenger for Android becoming available in 2017. All new Android devices from Sprint will have the RCS-enabled version of Messenger enabled by default on their systems starting next year. In recent months Intel has been demonstrating how aerial drones can be used for entertainment purposes. The company set a world record earlier this year by putting 100 drones into the air simultaneously, all of which were controlled by a single pilot. But on Nov. 4, Intel unveiled a new drone designed specifically for light shows and announced that the company in October had set a new Guinness World Record by having 500 of the drones—called the Intel Shooting Star—in the air at the same time, again being controlled by a single pilot in a demonstration presented in Germany.       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

  News Apple Google Microsoft AMD Zen Summit Ridge Overclocking Variants Aimed At Overclockers By Talha Amjad  /  1 week ago Share Tweet Intel has their K-series SKUs when it comes to CPUs. These have unlocked multipliers, meaning that if you have the correct type of motherboard then you can overclock these a fair bit. AMD seems to be going down the same road with their AMD Zen Summit Ridge series processors. Word has it that there will be AMD Zen Summit Ridge CPUs that will be aimed at overclockers as these overclockable variants will be able to go up a fair amount as compared to their non-overclockable variants. Rumors suggest that there will be at least one AMD Zen Summit Ridge overclockable variant and that these will come with a higher clock speed out of the box and will have a higher overclocking margin as well. It has been suggested that this AMD Zen Summit Ridge CPU will have 8 cores and a TDP of 95W. These special AMD Zen Summit Ridge series processors will feature a higher price as they will be able to pack a punch. We will need to see how users respond to this. While Intel has only the K-series that can be overclocked, AMD offers unlocked multipliers across the board. We will have to see whether these new processors will be worth the extra money. More importantly, if users will deem them worthy or not. Last but not least, it seems that these AMD Zen Summit Ridge series processors will not come with a heatsink out of the box like the regular models do. AMD did release their Wraith cooler a while back but it seems that these overclockable CPUs will need something much better than that. AMD Zen Summit Ridge series processors are expected to come out early 2017 so stay tuned for that. What do you think about these new CPUs coming out aimed at overclockers and PC enthusiasts?

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 7, 2016 at 1:31PM Over the last several years, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has been working hard to bring down the losses associated with its mobile product development. Said losses peaked at just over $4.2 billion in 2014, but Intel says that they came down by nearly $1 billion in 2015 and are expected to come down by at least another $800 million in 2016. Intel's former Mobile and Communications Group general manager, Hermann Eul, at the launch of the company's Bay Trail platform for tablets. Image source: Intel.  This means that the losses in 2016 should be about $2.4 billion -- still substantial, but far better than where they were in 2014. The loss reductions have come from a combination of cost-cutting (e.g., cancelling projects and laying off workers) as well as a significant reduction in "contra-revenue" payments as its tablet processor shipments have dried up. Unfortunately, much of what has allowed Intel to dramatically reduce those losses are pretty much one-off impacts. Significant additional operating expense reductions are unlikely to be feasible considering the previous cuts, and the company's contra-revenue program looks just about done. This means that the next phase of Intel's mobile loss reductions needs to come from good old-fashioned improved business performance. The first place for Intel to start would be with its cellular modem efforts. Focusing on the modem Intel recently won the modem spot inside of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) latest iPhone 7-series smartphones, splitting the orders with wireless giant Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). This win is likely bringing in some much-needed revenue to the chipmaker's mobile division. And, if those modems are being sold at positive gross profit margins (they likely are), then those sales are likely helping to bring Intel's mobile losses down in 2016 compared to what they were in 2015. However, it's also likely that the margins on these modems aren't great. Not only does Intel's modem provide inferior performance to its Qualcomm-built version per Cellular Insights (which suggests that Intel can't charge as much as Qualcomm can), but the modem itself is believed to be built by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM). The lack of pricing power coupled with the fact that Intel relies on a third party to manufacture the part (and that third party makes about 50% gross profit margins on those parts) means that Intel is likely pocketing very little in terms of gross profit on these products. For Intel to improve its mobile profitability, it needs to make some changes to both improve what it can charge for its modems as well as the competitiveness of its products. What Intel needs to do To bulk up its modem average selling prices, Intel will need to narrow the gap with Qualcomm's offerings in terms of modem performance and features. Right now, Intel's best is several generations behind what Qualcomm has in the marketplace -- a fact that likely forces Intel to sell these modems on the cheap. Intel's mobile losses are still substantial and the company has made it clear the investing in modem technology is a key priority for the company. At this point, I don't think Intel's problem is that it's not investing enough in research and development, but rather inefficient use of those research and development dollars. Management needs to work to identify why its spending on modems is yielding sub-par results and take appropriate action to fix those problems. Beyond that, Intel isn't doing itself any favors by having these modems built externally when it runs its own chip manufacturing operations (and routinely boasts about how its costs are superior to what its manufacturing competitors can deliver). Intel is expected to build its next-next generation modem (XMM 7560) on its own 14-nanometer manufacturing technology. The good news is that by moving the modem in-house, Intel benefits in a couple of ways: Intel doesn't have to pay a contract chip manufacturer roughly 50% margins; the company can keep that for itself. Intel should be able to deliver a substantial power consumption benefit, all else equal, because its 14-nanometer technology is much more efficient than TSMC's old 28-nanometer technology. This could improve Intel's product competitiveness. The bad news is that a transition from XMM 7480 (built by a third party) to XMM 7560 (built by Intel) won't begin to kick in to the company's financials until mid- to late 2018. A potential mobile loss trajectory Intel may provide investors with an expected trajectory for its mobile losses during its investor meeting in February 2017. Ahead of that, I'd like to put my predictions out there. In 2017, Intel should get a revenue/gross profit benefit from having a full year of modem shipments to Apple relative to 2016, which should help overall profitability. Additionally, if Intel was still shipping significant quantities of mobile products that required contra-revenue payments during 2016 (and the first half of 2016), those should fade significantly during 2017. I don't think the loss reduction in 2017 will be anywhere near what it was in 2015 or in 2016, but something on the order of $200 million to $300 million might be reasonable to expect. In 2018, Intel probably won't be able to get any significant benefit from contra-revenue payments abating as I expect that program to be done long before then. During the second half of 2018, Intel could get a product margin/average selling price improvement from the XMM 7560, which could help further drive down those losses. Without Intel scoring significantly new mobile business outside of Apple, it'll be difficult for the company to meaningfully boost revenue to start driving down the losses. Intel has indicated that it still intends to remain in the mobile processor game, so if the company starts shipping significant volumes of mobile processors to various smartphone vendors in the 2018 time frame (something I frankly doubt), then those loss reductions could accelerate. We'll almost certainly know more about Intel's mobile strategy and longer-term financial expectations in a few months. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel and Qualcomm.

Unidentified leaked Windows smartphone is "much more than just a concept". By Owen Hughes November 7, 2016 18:17 GMT Do these photos show the Surface Phone, or another device entirely?Evan Blass/ Twitter Smartphone fans have been left in a flurry after a series of photos leaked online showing what some believe could be the long-rumoured Surface Phone. The shots, published to Twitter by serial smartphone sleuth Evan Blass, show a sleek black smartphone running what appears to be a full version on Windows 10. Alongside a collection of renders of the mysterious phone, Blass – known to the Twitterverse as @evleaks – uploaded photos that appear to show the handset being used in the wild. According to Blass, said handset is powered by a laptop-grade Intel processor. It should be noted that Blass never once mentions the term 'Surface Phone', although that hasn't stopped excited Twitter users speculating that the device could be the fabled Windows 10 flagship. Other sources claim that the subject of the images is in fact a Dell-made mobile phone that runs a full version of Windows 10, as opposed to Windows 10 Mobile. Tech news site Thurrott, which cites "sources familiar with the matter", goes on to report that the handset pictured was a planned Dell device based on x86 Intel architecture, that was scuppered when Intel abandoned plans for an Atom mobile chipset earlier this year. Whatever it is, Blass suggested in a Twitter exchange with the Verge reporter Tom Warren that the phone in the pictures is "much more than a concept", and suggested users keep their eyes open for further info. Exactly what we're looking at, then, remains a mystery. If Microsoft is planning a Surface Phone, it would likely be the company's last chance to turn around its mobile business. Windows Phone now accounts for less than one percent of the worldwide smartphone market and, with the arrival of entirely new product ranges like the Surface Studio and HoloLens, Microsoft may wish to cut its losses with mobile and instead dedicate itself to carving out a mantle for its new hardware. Either way, Blass usually tends to be on the money when it comes to all things smartphone, so one way or another we expect to hear more about this mysterious Windows Phone in the (hopefully) not-too-distant future.

Understanding how end-users access and experience network applications requires a new approach. Ten years ago, enterprises could count on Ethernet-connected, Intel-based Windows devices accessing on-premise applications. This made it possible to improve end-user experience within established use cases. But that scenario is the exception today rather than the norm. Most applications today are supported by a dynamic infrastructure distributed across on-premise and the public cloud.  And client devices are copiously diverse in terms of hardware, operating systems, drivers, and more. To add to the overall complexity, these devices are accessing networks via Wi-Fi over dynamic RF environments and potentially unreliable Internet connections. What insight can traditional application performance monitoring (APM) and related technology provide in this new landscape? APM tools answer the question of how long a client transaction takes to get satisfied once it hits the web server. This takes into account the transaction times between the web server, app servers, database servers, etc. APM homes in on the inner workings of a multi-tier application within the data center. Even a brief consideration of contemporary applications, however, reveals that this portion now constitutes just a tiny segment of the overall user application experience. First, IT is increasingly working with business critical applications beyond its control. When third-party applications are in use, IT cannot instrument a third party’s data center and the use of APM technology becomes moot. Second, using APM presupposes that clients are able to efficiently connect to the access network and subsequently reach the application webserver. When this connection fails, APM tools are not equipped to collect or analyze data from the wireless LAN infrastructure, the campus network services, nor the health of the WAN/Internet link. Limited by its scope, APM is simply not the right tool to address the complexity of issues users are facing before their transactions even hit the application webserver. What’s missing? To gain maximum visibility into the user application experience, network operations staff need insight into the client device’s ability to associate in a timely manner to a wireless access point, authenticate via RADIUS, obtain an IP address via DHCP, resolve domain names via DNS and finally transmit/receive data from the internet. If any of these steps fail, it would be pointless to consider the “application performance” since users have failed to even access the application. Maintaining complete awareness of all of these user network transactions is daunting for network managers who must sift through volumes of network, application and user data from a variety of domain silos. Evolving interdependences between networks, devices and applications are driving the need for a more holistic approach to IT analytics. Performance metrics about the application, wireless/RF, network services, Internet link, as well as device type and operating system information must be collected simultaneously across the stack. Next, these metrics need to be analyzed and correlated across time and other dimensions (e.g. locations, SSIDs, VLANs, etc.). Finally, advanced machine learning algorithms need to be applied on top of these metrics in order to surface insights and remediation advice proactively. Network managers largely concern themselves with the operation of the wired and wireless infrastructure, but as cloud-based SAAS applications, smart devices, unified communications (UC) and Wi-Fi become more pervasive, a broader, client-based perspective is required to answer fundamental questions about end-user experiences. User application analytics arrives A more complete view of enterprise application behavior from the perspective of the user requires simultaneously collecting and correlating client wireless performance metrics, network service performance metrics, device/OS information and, finally, application performance metrics. The most frictionless way to accomplish this is with a combination of real-time packet analysis along with data collection from other enterprise systems, including the wireless LAN controller, as well as APIs from UC and other applications. Finally, advanced analysis including machine learning must be performed on the data in order to automatically surface insights. New user application analytics (UAA)software technology looks to provide precisely this broad scope. UAA software runs passively within the enterprise access or campus network without the need for client software, synthetic testing, additional sensors or infrastructure hardware. Real-time application identification technology and deep packet inspection of wired packets, along with Wi-Fi metrics from wireless LAN controllers, are analyzed across the entire OSI stack for every client transaction as it occurs on the network. Applications are identified and performance metrics measured in real-time by looking at underlying protocol (e.g. HTTP, TCP, RTP, etc.) interactions and response times. How user application analytics works Application behavior for a given user, user group, discrete application, location or even a specific virtual wireless network (SSID) can then be determined and compared across a number of different dimensions to derive real answers to questions about the actual end-user application experience, such as: What is the baseline for user experience with application X? When the user experience of an application is poor, is it due to Wi-Fi, the device, the Internet link or the application itself? How does user experience vary across locations, subnets, SSIDs, RF bands, etc. Can users connect reliably to Wi-Fi and are link layer services being provided properly?  If I increase the capacity of my DNS server, how many client-hours worth of SaaS user experience problems can I mitigate? With UAA, IT staff are able to easily determine application adoption trends, traffic usage, individual and systemic client incidents and root-cause, historic trends as well as overall quality of experience for any user at any time. Unified Communications monitoring presents one of the strongest use cases for user application analytics largely due to the prolific uptake in UC and the investments in digital transformation of multimedia business content. For UC applications like Skype for Business, UAA hooks into vendor APIs to understand the user application experience with even greater fidelity. Call attributes such as mean opinion score (MOS), a standard telephony measure describing the actual user experience, are ingested, analyzed and correlated with other network transaction metrics. Today's enterprise applications are becoming highly distributed, often with components spread across on-premises data centers and public clouds. For network managers, a good user application experience can no longer be divorced from the underlying wireless access infrastructure, network services and mobile devices used to access them. This now places IT staff in a precarious position of having to delve deep into volumes of network, client, and applications data to understand the actual user experience.  New user application analytics technology promises to finally give IT staff a complete view of their network from every angle and quantitative justification for the billions of dollars in IT investments being made every year to keep user productivity on enterprise networks humming.

Mr Blass described this mobile as being "Powered by a laptop-class Intel processor," and asked, "Would this have blown your mind?" According to Thurrott.com the pictured smartphone was a Windows 10 'holy grail device', not the fabled Microsoft Surface Phone but a device made by well known systems maker Dell. Mysteriously, the Thurrott article says that the future almost arrived via Dell "but barriers have stopped this device from reaching the market." Its sources familiar with the phone model confirm that this was a Dell branded Windows 10 mobile with an Intel x86 processor inside. After being questioned about the device renders by various newshounds @evleaks revealed that the Dell Windows 10 mobile is/was "much more than a concept" and asked his Twitter followers to stay tuned. Another image accompanied this teaser with the smartphone shown in use in various environments. In further details about the product from Thurrott, the mobile apparently had a laptop-like companion to make the most of the Continuum experience. Looking a bit more about the reasons this smartphone was shelved, it was likely down to Intel's decision to give up on its low-end Atom processor development. It is noted that the HP Elite X3 gets close to the functionality offered by the Dell phone but its Continuum usage is limited due to its ARM processor and therefore its tie to mobile apps.

The funny thing is I'd actually pick a mid range WinMo phone over Apple or Android because of the rest of my MS integration at home/work but the one I'd be looking at seems so overpriced compared with the same spec Android phone. Admittedly I'm not a snapchat or similar user but for my usage (telephone calls/texts, navigation, web, email and ‘office’ stuff) it would suit me fine. Posted by Otherhand - Mon 07 Nov 2016 13:00 I loved my Windows Phones, but the platform was dead for me when (during an absurdly long OS redesign which apparently still isn't complete) they announced a guarantee that the app gap was over - that virtually anything on Android/iOS could and would come to WP, thanks to a cross-platform authoring system. The deployment window came and went, and Microsoft shrugged and pootled on. Nobody can dangle a carrot that large in front of its audience and not deliver. Its already small base suffered an exodus of people like me who had had enough of being treated poorly as customers. It's a shame, because it's a truly lovely OS in many ways, but they got into a whack-a-mole situation with bugs, and the new bugs that raised their heads were major. At one point, I couldn't reliably make or receive calls for a month and a half - an ability which a lot of people would say was a key reason for buying a phone in the first place. This bug resurfaced later, multiple times. The last phone I had was a flagship of its year, the Lumia 920. It had a serious overheating issue affecting all owners. There was a solution: turn off Bluetooth, turn off NFC. But even as this became clear, MS never admitted it was a fault. It was more important to them to keep selling a phone as having NFC/Bluetooth functionality than to consider the customers who, after suffering a phone getting to cooking temperature while idle in their pockets, would go to Android and never look back. Posted by 3dcandy - Mon 07 Nov 2016 13:45 It's dead as a platform. Apps are being discontinued left right and centre. Amazon app has gone, facebook app is months out of date.

It's a true 2-in-1 laptop, and allows you to separate the display from the keyboard, giving real tablet and laptop functionality. With it you get a full size keyboard, and the ability to pick from 4 different modes for viewing the display - laptop, tent, tablet, and stand. The HP Pavilion 12 x2 review also shows how the PC includes all the ports you need, from USB-C, USB 2.0, microSD, and even micro HDMI. The dual front-facing Bang & Olufsen speakers are a rare find on a laptop as well. Be sure to check out the full HP Pavilion x2 review to find out why this is likely the best budget laptop on the market today! You can pick up the HP Pavilion X2 now.

When used with the keyboard, it’s less than an inch thick, and weighs just under 3 and a quarter pounds. The metal keyboard base is easily detachable, allowing you to sit back and relax with it in tablet mode. Of course, if you need to bang out some emails, or just want the more traditional form factor, you also have the standard laptop mode. Other views include stand mode, which puts the display front and center, with the keyboard behind it, tucked out of the way, and tent mode, which HP says is great for watching TV, movies, or even my YouTube channel. Looking at the ports on the device, you have USB 2.0 and a 3.5mm jack on the left, and over on the right, there’s a microSD card slot, mini HDMI, and a USB-C port that’s capped at USB 3.0 speeds. This port is also used for charging the device. As for the processor, you can choose between the Intel Atom version with 2 or 4GB RAM which starts at $499, or opt for the version I have here, which rocks a sixth-generation Intel Core M3 chip and costs $549, just $50 more. That’s matched up with 4GB RAM, a 128GB SSD, and the touch display that you see right up front, with a 1920x1280 resolution and pen support - HP’s active pen is sold separately. It’s an IPS display, so viewing angles are good and don’t get washed out - you’ll wanna keep the brightness jacked up though, as I found the display to be on the dim side. On the sides of the display you’ve got a pair of speakers - don’t let the Bang & Olufson logo fool you though, as the sound that comes out of these is just average. The nice part is that they are front-facing speakers, which is a rarity on laptops and tablets. As for cameras, there’s nothing on the rear, but up front you get a camera that does 720p high definition video for those Skype calls. The keyboard itself is fine, you get enough space to not feel cramped, and also good travel distance on the keys so that you can feel that you are actually pressing something. The trackpad is also good - not the best I’ve ever used mind you, but for a budget machine, it gets the job done. One other cool thing here is when you open the Pavilion X2, you notice that the keyboard raises up, giving you a nice incline. It’s something you see other manufacturers do, like Microsoft does with the Surface, but it’s never this solid of a connection. It feels really nice here. All in all, the HP Pavilion X2 12-inch is a great machine for the money, and should get you through the majority of the day - I was managing roughly 6.5 hours of battery life. If you’re thinking of picking one up, I suggest going with the Intel M3 version, as you get a faster processor, as well as faster internal SSD storage. It looks and feels like a premium laptop, but won’t break the bank. Let me know if the HP Pavilion X2 is something you might consider, whether it be for school or work. If you need something with a similar form factor for business-class work, be sure to check out my video on the HP Elite X2 for comparison.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries e-edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Game designer's brainstormed ideas becoming reality Sunday Nov 6, 2016 at 12:01 AM Nov 6, 2016 at 5:49 PM Lindsey Tropf is close to launching "Tyto Online," an online video game in which the player creates a customized character who is an evacuee from Earth who must conduct ecosystem experiments on an alien planet to survive. Anthony Clark @AnthonyClarkbz Lindsey Tropf has been in the Intel Education Accelerator program in Silicon Valley since August with four other people from her Gainesville company, Immersed Games. The program mentors startup educational technology companies and puts them in touch with investors. In a couple weeks, Immersed Games will launch “Tyto Online,” an online video game available for PC and Mac through their website and the Steam online video game site. After starting the company with a $50,000 Kickstarter campaign and $400,000 from early-stage investors, the idea is to take data about the game’s use to the program’s demo day where startups pitch to venture capitalists. “We’re making our way in the Valley with investors out here,” Tropf, 30, said by telephone. Tropf started working on her idea for Immersed Games in 2012, recruited interns and employees, raised funds, and launched a smaller offline version of the game called “Tyto Ecology” earlier this year to make money — it has sold 15,000 digital copies — and prove that they were onto something consumers would enjoy ahead of the full launch. “It’s kind of mind-blowingly crazy to be able to think about this because ideas I was brainstorming three years ago are now in the game,” she said. In Tyto Online, the player creates a customized character who is an evacuee from Earth and settles on an alien world to conduct ecosystem experiments involving real and alien plants and animals. Maintain balance and your ecosystem survives and thrives. Out of balance and your ecosystem collapses. The game teaches real science concepts and includes links to videos and activities, such as a citizens' science website to figure out what invasive species live around you and what to do about it. “What’s really inspiring is our game is an educational platform where students are discovering really cool educational areas, but also learning they really like the stuff in real life and want to do something about it in the real world, too,” Tropf said. Tropf, who is from Vero Beach, was studying school psychology at the University of Florida and researching educational video games. What she found was that many games did not have a connection between the game and the learning experience, such as one in which you solve a math problem and then get to shoot a zombie, she said. Others only had a few hours to a week’s worth of content, requiring parents or students to constantly have to find new games. Having grown up playing online games such as “Star Wars Galaxies” and “World of Warcraft” that could hold players’ attention for a decade, she realized players could learn so much more from a better-designed and fun game. After talking about her idea for a year, her husband, Ryan, signed on. She met Creative Director Caroline Lamarque at a job and internship fair. She met technical founders Samuel Sewall and Victor Matos in a video gaming club on campus. The Kickstarter campaign allowed her to pay two people for development and others came on full-time with investment funding. Today, Immersed Games has 13 paid employees, including six through an on-the-job training grant from CareerSource North Central Florida, and 10 interns in an office in the Gainesville Community Redevelopment Agency building on Northwest Fifth Avenue. Employees include graduates of UF, the University of Central Florida’s game design program, the DigiPen Institute in Seattle and the Savannah College of Art and Design. Tropf said Gainesville has been a great place to get started with help from the grant, other entrepreneurs and the low cost of doing business. The challenge is recruiting millennials who tend to prefer big cities and investors who want businesses to be close to them, she said. Tropf said she plans to keep building on the game, adding more science, technology, engineering and math content over time, likely including heredity and possibly robotics. Science was a good starting point as an area of high concern and need that lends itself well to a video game where variables and systems are at play. Kids — as well as the Immersed Games team — are interested in animals, so ecology made sense. “This is a really big moment for us because this is the game we founded the company to do and plan on working on for the foreseeable future,” she said. “We see our company developing one game, but it’s a massive game you can play for years and years.” About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Reader Services Subscribe Now Manage My Account Vacation Stops/Restarts FAQs Contact Us Terms of Service Submissions News Tips Letters to the Editor Calendar Events Obituaries Legal Notices Advertising Advertising Advertise With Us Place an Ad Display Ads Classified Ads Online Services Newsletters Online Services RSS Feeds Text Alerts Archives Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2016 GateHouse Media, LLC.

UPDATE: 5pm ET: Today, in a letter sent to clients and first reported by VRM Intel, the company said it is shutting up shop. “While LeisureLink attracted considerable interest from many strategic buyers and investors, management has determined that none of these parties are likely to complete a transaction before late Q4 of 2016. This timing and the continuing cash needs of the Company has created a liquidity deficit which prevents the Company from continuing its daily operations…. At this time, all employees of LeisureLink are being terminated and the platform turned off” (See reader comment, below, for the full letter.) LeisureLink’s closure strands several resort/hotel type managers as well as traditional vacation rental managers. Back to our original story: Earlier this year, the company said it had received a $17 million round of funding, with investors Clearstone Ventures, Kinderhook Industries and Escalate Capital Partners participating. Since its founding in 2007, it has raised more than $34 million. On Friday, SoCal Tech reported that the company has been sending email messages to clients that say: “We’ve been working aggressively to complete a corporate transaction. Regardless of what you may have heard we are still in that process and anticipate a positive outcome.” Tnooz’s voice and email messages to top-level executives this morning have not been returned, as of this afternoon. The only executive we could reach on the phone has declined to comment. In August, Utah-based LeisureLink sold several of its consumer-facing websites to Aspen-based Ski.com. Earlier this year, an official had told Tnooz that the company was working on releasing new, public APIs for distributors and suppliers. The goal was to enable LeisureLink rates and inventory to be passed over to Airbnb, HomeAway’s Escapia software, and Seekda’s Regatta booking engine. In 2014, LeisureLink was bought by VacationRoost, which changed its group name to LeisureLink. LeisureLink’s online chat system for customer service was closed today. When Tnooz contacted an account manager by phone, he was telling customers that all he could say was that “the company is going through a corporate transaction and they are hoping to get the business details resolved quickly.” Apparently any such potential deal fell through.   Previous Article Next Article   About the Writer :: Sean O'Neill Sean O’Neill is Editor-in-Chief of Tnooz.

Required fields are marked * Comment Notify me of followup comments via e-mail Name * Email * Website Jeffery Hill I am trying to figure out if this fall under Utah or California. The address was Utah. I just left a message with the Atty General’s office. I believe that under the law notices were suppose to have been sent to all creditors within 30 days of the closure which I believe was Sept 23rd. So it’s possible that those have been sent but I have not received anything yet. In the long run, I’m sure no one will see any money. This is essentially a bankruptcy and I’m sure the assets will not cover what it owed. If anything is paid out it will be pennies on the dollar. If anyone knows anything else, please post Reply 3 weeks ago   Cote Property Management I did get a letter from the Utah Atty General’s office, they said it falls under California law. They suggested contacting an attorney there. Reply 3 weeks ago   Geri Hauck We have yet to receive any forms or paperwork as stipulated in their notice of closure. Reply 1 week ago   Former LL Client Odd how Leisure Link still has its ties to Homeaway and VRBO has anyone heard back from the Utah attorneys office? Reply 4 weeks ago   Cote Property Management I heard back from the Utah Attorney Generals office, they said to file a complaint with California, which I did. They also suggested contacting an attorney. I think there needs to be a class action suit. I know there are places that suffered must larger losses then me and wonder if any of them have started anything? Reply 4 weeks ago   Peter in Colorado Every vacation rental manager should know that Advance Deposits paid by guests must be kept in separate bank accounts until those funds are earned. How was LL able to bypass this basic obligation and use Advance Deposit payments to fund their operations without committing fraud? If fraud has been committed, who is being held culpable? I would like to be able to tell my staff and my clients (who are all losing money on this!) that someone is being held to account for this fiasco! Reply 1 month ago   Cote Property Management So, since there are so many of us who have lost substantial funds due to the mismanagement of Leisure Link, aren’t there legal steps that can be taken? I have sent a message to the Attorney General’s office in California and Utah but wonder what we can do as a group. Perhaps if everyone sends a complaint to the Utah Attorney Generals office, it’s online, easy to fill out, maybe someone will look at the seriousness of this issue.

Reply 1 month ago   Matthew Gurley Hey Rhonda, If you file a chargeback on your credit card it should be refunded by the credit card company. Reply 1 month ago   Rhonda Vinje Hey there…. That’s a negative, we tried that, Chase declined it. But thank you for responding. We paid in good faith & in full using our debit card. I should clarify, we got our vacation, but not our security deposit back. I was thankful the house existed & the key worked in the door knowing now what was going on behind-the-scenes! I will be VERY Leary next time around. Who can you trust today, there’s a scammer on every corner. Reply 1 month ago   Kristen Cherry The difficult part of the merchant of record solution is no OTA has a great system for managing payment or declined cards, which for some of the OTA channels can be a significant percentage, add in the process of making changes and modifications to existing reservations and the business of “handing this over” becomes the easy and necessary solution. Nobody could have foreseen this ending….the theory and vision were there…the execution fell flat. Property managers already have 10 jobs from managing homeowner expectations, wowing guests, maintenance -you name it. Managing the OTA channels from allotment, content, pricing, payments, and promos is just to daunting and unrealistic. Other intermediaries will gain market share – but established infrastructure will be critical. Reply 1 month ago   Displaced Worker from LL Please forgive me as I shamelessly use this platform to solicit employment. Desperate times call for desperate measures! I am among the many blindsided employees of LeisureLink who were left jobless. Are any of you competitors hiring? I was with Hawaiian Beach Rentals before VacationRoost bought them out, then worked with VacationRoost prior to their acquisition of LeisureLink, finally settling in a comfortable position with LeisureLink. Therefore, I have experience in many different sectors of the business. I worked remotely for my entire time with the company- over 5 years in total. I am located in Southern California (Inland Empire). I see that many of you are outside the US. Maybe a remote US employee is just what you need! 😉 However, I have come to terms with the unlikelihood of finding another remote position, so hopefully some of you are local enough to utilize my eagerness to work with you. If at all possible, I would love to stay within the same (or similar) industry. Thanks for your consideration. Reply 1 month ago   Alex Aydin Send me your resume. We are hiring. Reply 1 month ago   Richard Vaughton I have to follow up on Alex’s comment here and is a common discussion point amongst managers and is well placed. Offering up full cash management to a third party is a risky situation. Managers are responsible to owners and this third party cash managament can cascade problems significantly. Look at Vacasol another “mid agent” sitting between contratctors, self marketing and creative channel distribution, now in bankcruptcy procedings and with clients possibly out of pocket. Any technology partner should be that, a conduit to booking success, with a means of transacting money seamlessly through secure, ring fenced bank accounts. Even UK banks will only secure £75K, so collect direct and manage efficiently. Its also not just the question of the being way out of pocket, its the lack of dynamic access to OTA’s on which many now rely. As for the $17m or $34m of however much was involved, it would be interesting to see the full story at some point.. Reply 1 month ago   Leisurelink Employee Alex if Leisurelink posed such a credit risk why did you try to buy them? Reply 2 months ago   Alex Aydin I think any company’s greatest assets is their employees. Leisurelink had very good, hard working and dedicated staff. It is a shame that they ended up in this situation. Reply 1 month ago   Former LL Employee It is a shame @AlexAydin. We busted our humps and it’s sad and disappointing that it ended like this. No severance either unfortunately. I don’t hold any grudges though. I’m grateful for the opportunity and the experience. Any former competitors out there that are looking to hire, I’d love to send you my resume! I have 3+ years experience working for an Online Travel Distributor as an Account Support Specialist troubleshooting software and listing issues for out clients. I would be a very worthy addition to your team ! Reply 1 month ago   Alex Aydin Send us your resume. We are looking to expand our support team. https://www.mybookingpal.com/sub-careers/applyform?id=2 1 month ago   Alex Aydin Lesson to be learned from Leisurelink   With the situation that former LeisureLink clinets and suppliers find themselves in, it can be a frightening time for property managers. We are hoping that all LeisureLink suppliers receive some, if not all, of the funds that are still owed to them. If, and when, suppliers receive their funds, they are still dealt with the daunting task of searching for another channel manager while the risk of another LeisureLink situation looms in their mind. To avert another LeisureLink situation, property managers must first understand why the situation occurred in the first place. The epicenter of the LeisureLink failure revolved around credit risk and business continuity. Credit risk was due to the model LeisureLink used where they operated as Merchant of Record. In that model, LeisureLink collected the funds given from guests and OTAs and would then transfer the funds owed to the supplier typically after guest departure from the property. This is where the property management risk comes into play. If the channel manager, as the Merchant of Record fails, then the supplier runs the risk of not getting paid. To avoid this as a supplier of properties, choose a channel manager that allows the property manager to act as Merchant of Record. This will allow property managers to receive payments directly from guests or OTAs. As Merchant of Record, property manager eliminates any possibility of credit risk on behalf of the channel manager. Reply 2 months ago   Steve Sherlock @Sean – perhaps Tnooz can discuss this internally, though for those folks making pretty serious accusations and who aren’t prepared to put their name to the accusation, then perhaps those comments should be removed. For all you know those making the accusations are competitors of those they accuse. Bit of a sordid affair all round. Reply 2 months ago   Matthew Gurley This is completely incorrect. I would truly appreciate it if you would stop trolling our company online. This is completely unprofessional and considered defamation. BookingPal is a separate entity and competitor of LeisureLink. If you took 20 minutes with me to look at our platform you would realize it’s completely different. Contact me for more details. Reply 2 months ago   BookingPAL is not your pal All the way at the top, the former President of Leisurelink, Richard Barajas, is now an adviser for BookingPal. I dont believe I would want anyone that helped steer a company into despair advising me on a damn thing. whether he was a current executive or not is irrelevant. A company doesn’t go down in five minutes…its an evolution of piss poor decision making and that very well goes back to the tenure of Richard Barajas and many other idiotic people. He was the President in December 2013 Reply 2 months ago   Matthew Gurley Again. Defamation and incorrect. I advice Tnooz admins to please remove this user from your pages. Our board of directors can be found directly on our website. 1 member used to work with LeisureLink. We are an American built company and only 3 years old in the space, and completely different from LeisureLink. Do some research. Our integrations are different, products are different, channel support is different. BookingPal only supports a fraction of channels LeisureLink did. If this was remotely true we would have the exact same connections right? Please act professional and join us to help LeisureLink users regain access to distribution in a way where they cannot possibly lose money. A key difference between us and Leisurelink is the ability to allow the PM to be merchant of record (something LeisureLink tried and failed to repeat consistently). This way a PM can use us, remain merchant of record, and not have the chance to lose funds in a situation like LeisureLink’s ever again. Reply 2 months ago   Richard Barajas I hesitate to respond to a nameless, non-specific post but I feel compelled to do so until Tnooz recognizes this as defamation and a defenseless position that should be removed. The most important things I’d like to communicate are 1) I’m saddened to see this outcome for LeisureLink. All the employees, including myself, worked hard and did our best for our customers and our company. 2) BookingPal is a top-notch, professional organization with great technology and people. They have built a solid integrated infrastructure from day 1 targeted to serve the Vacation Rental marketplace. I encourage you to contact them and decide for yourself. Reply 2 months ago   Erica We are customers of a property that got screwed over by Leisure Link and guess what? When we arrived to the property they made us pay twice for the room we had already paid for in full, because Leisure Link hadn’t paid them. So guess who really got screwed here? Me the guest and you know what? $500 extra is a lot to me whereas I’m guessing it’s nothing to you Richard Barajas. So now we have paid twice for a room because you and your company. I plan to contact news agencies in Colorado to get the word out about your sham-full business practices. Reply 1 month ago   martin alletson Dear Sir. I realize no one ever wants to go out of business unless there is no other way. We are a small independent hotel 128 rooms and are owed about $40,000. from LL as I have no way of knowing the companies debt, would you be kind enough to just tell me what if any chance we have of collecting that monies owed.

I can loop you in with Expedia and AirBnB. If there are any funds that they were still holding and had not sent to leisurelink already, they can send the funds directly to you. Reply 2 months ago   Former LL Employee I was with LeisureLink for 3+ years and I’m disappointed that it ended like this. How did we come to this point? I believe we should’ve put more energy, focus, and capital on our Technology instead of going out and signing up new clients first and foremost, which I believe caused issues with scalability and ultimately led to our downfall. Any contemporaries out there hiring? I’m located in Los Angeles, CA. Reply 2 months ago   Wendy And where does this leave us, the individuals that booked and paid thru .com sites, who have upcoming reservations but the hotel has not received payment (and probably won’t receive) Reply 2 months ago   Matthew Gurley We are very sad to see LeisureLink go and to see the effect it has had on property managers in our industry. BookingPal is the leading platform the industry, allowing you to reach these OTA’s with a full integration and be merchant of record. Please feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns. We are here to help you through a smooth transition.

I am aware of another sales organization/channel that went of out business who also owed their suppliers thousands, and I believe the credit card companies were able to help to some degree. Also going forward look hard at who is merchant of record, are there options or structures to help avoid this in the future.

Reply 2 months ago   Colorado PM This is so unfortunate but you wonder how a Harvard MBA and a board of directors that include executives from publicly traded companies waste $30+ millions. LeisureLink was known for big parties at MTS, expensive dinners and over promising. Some account managers were great and feel bad for them. They owe us $200K so many will be unemployed before ski season thanks to an inept management team and board members. Reply 2 months ago   Julie Hightower They haven’t paid our hotel for people who stayed in June, July, August & September. In speaking with Expedia today, they actually invoiced them for all reservation up to and including September 24th. You can’t invoice Expedia until the day of the reservation. So just before they close, they decided to screw us one last time. They currently owe $65,000. We have 45 reservations still on the books for the next six weeks, unfortunately if Expedia can not assure us payment for these, we will be forced to cancel them.

Reply 4 weeks ago   Eric Mason Yes, this is disheartening to hear and unfortunately, this will leave some consumers and suppliers in a very difficult situation. One suggestion for consumers caught up in this is to reach out ASAP to your credit card company to see if there is any relief they can extend. We’ve been talking a lot about this on Vacation Rental Professionals, a Linkedin Group (https://www.linkedin.com/groups/69889) as well.

It was not distributed to the suppliers – we’re a property manager and they still owe us thousands for winter bookings. Julian strung us along saying it was just due to disorganization because they grew so fast or that they were waiting for payment from Expedia or booking.com. I think Julian has a lot of explaining to do to his employees and suppliers. He’s probably walking away with millions and the rest of us are being screwed. I guess that’s what a Harvard MBA does for you. Reply 2 months ago   Carl They screwed us too! We are a property manager, small company, they owe us $9000. Very painful! Reply 2 months ago   Mike (wife was employee) My guess would be that $17 million was a theoretical amount to be disbursed over time if goals and milestones were met. Putting money into LL was a risky idea and they didn’t get all that money in a lump sum. I know they were hurting to operating money for a while even after securing that money.

RedAwning has opened our doors to help clients quickly transition and maintain their distribution and we are happy to see our industry leading position in vacation rental reservations and channel management expand, while we’d rather see it happen another way. Reply 2 months ago   Jane Doe Just received this from them: Dear Valued Partner, LeisureLink has been helping suppliers of vacation rentals generate bookings through third party channels for over nine years, and has experienced accelerated growth for the past several quarters. Supporting this growth and building the technology solutions for the industry has been a capital intensive process. LeisureLink is privately-owned and has historically met these capital needs with investments from its owners. For the last 12 months, LeisureLink has been working with an investment bank to raise additional equity capital to fund the Company’s growth for the future. The Company expected this process would yield an infusion of needed capital this summer. While LeisureLink attracted considerable interest from many strategic buyers and investors, management has determined that none of these parties are likely to complete a transaction before late Q4 of 2016. This timing and the continuing cash needs of the Company has created a liquidity deficit which prevents the Company from continuing its daily operations. As a result, we have no choice but to stop operations and not process any new bookings as of September 27, 2016. At this time, all employees of LeisureLink are being terminated and the platform turned off. LeisureLink values the working relationships built over these last 9 years and appreciates the loyalty of its employees, vendors, customers and partners and is trying to cease operations as smoothly and orderly as possible, given the circumstances. To that end, the Company has agreed to undertake an Assignment for Benefit of Creditors (“Assignment”), which is a process designed to manage an orderly disposition of the Company’s assets and to distribute those proceeds to creditors according to their legal rights and priorities. As required by law, the Assignee will be mailing notices of the Assignment to all creditors in the next 30 days, providing further information about the Assignment and providing creditors with a proof of claim form through which creditors can file a claim for any obligations due.

If Hillary Clinton wins the election, the Democratic Party will have the chance to reclaim its ruptured relationship with working people—the wounded victims who lost their livelihoods to brute-force globalization.  With Trump out of the way, Democrats could reclaim their old franchise by proposing an aggressive agenda for reforming US industrial strategy—restoring the economy’s balance and equity that Bill Clinton’s New Democrats effectively dismantled a generation ago under the banner of “free trade.” Trump’s fed-up rebellion was driven by many things, but especially by the gutting of US manufacturing.  Michelle Obama has given us a bright slogan for reform: “When they go low, we go high.” Instead of Trump’s cheap-shot bigotry and vile resentments, Democrats need to envision a generational shift of positive purpose. Not to withdraw from global trade—of course not—but to adopt substantive reforms that redefine America’s own national priorities and terms of trade so that globalization can actually benefit all sectors of our society, not just the greedy One Percenters. We know this is possible in globalization because our rivals in trade manage to sustain broadly shared prosperity for their societies by designing their own self-interested industrial strategies. They do not ask themselves what will be good for the global trading system. They ask if it will be good for Germany or Japan, Sweden or China. Donald Trump’s ad-lib slogan—“America First”—was widely ridiculed by establishment cheerleaders in the United States. But “Germany first” or “Japan first” (not to mention Sweden and China first) are implicit strategies of the most successful exporting nations. Only in America do the policy-makers claim to be above such crass nationalism. They want the United States to be seen as the high-minded “indispensable nation” leading the world to higher ground. Foreign rivals privately scoff at US pretensions, but they also know how to manipulate American hubris at the negotiating table. Washington policy-makers essentially identify the US national interest in terms of American owners, not workers. The US approach to trade policy involves a crucial difference. Washington policy-makers essentially identify the US national interest in terms of American owners, not workers. That is, the policy objective reflects the interests of the investors and shareholders who own the multinational enterprises and far-flung capital investments. Elsewhere in the world, a German or Japanese economist—and probably most politicians—would say it is the interests of the workforce that determine the national interest. In other words, the US government’s industrial policy focuses first on serving capital, with an unspoken assumption that labor and society will benefit too if US multinationals succeed. Thus, US industrial strategy has willingly sacrificed the wage incomes of American workers to boost the profits of US multinationals by encouraging the offshoring of American jobs. This policy preference is embedded in trade deals, the tax code, and the permissive rules of corporate governance, in which CEOs are personally enriched for concentrating primarily on “shareholder value.” That narrow-minded standard has spawned a generation of fraudulent returns, but it also warps the economy. The distinctive US industrial strategy helps explains why globalization destabilized the American middle class. The distinctive US industrial strategy helps explains why globalization destabilized the American middle class while rival trading nations prospered by promoting social solidarity—defending workers and shielding vulnerable sectors from globalization’s stormy pressures. In Germany, for example, during the financial crash of 2008, the German labor federation made a deal with major manufacturers. Instead of massive layoffs, the companies agreed to keep workers on the payroll rather than dismantle its experienced workforce. As sociologist (and longtime Nation contributor and editorial board member) Norman Birnbaum explained, “Germans shared the political view that what made Germany strong was its educated, highly skilled working class.” The German chancellor oversees such industrial relationships and can pressure wayward companies attempting to go against the national consensus. German employees—both white-collar and blue-collar—have a formal voice in kibitzing management decisions. In contrast, America’s high-tech companies in Silicon Valley have routinely offloaded millions of jobs to Taiwan or China when new product lines are ready to be upscaled for mass production. The investors demand it. Shifting the production to low wages in Asia boosts their returns on capital. The federal government gives its blessing and facilitates the job shift with its permissive trade agreements. The late Andrew Grove, the legendary inventor and co-founder of Intel, reported for Bloomberg back in 2010 that Apple had 25,000 jobs in the United States and 250,000 in South China. Grove, who died last March, complained repeatedly that US industrial strategy was destroying America’s own manufacturing prowess. The multinationals reaped bigger profits, but China and Taiwan gained the engineering experience and infrastructure to dominate the future. With corporate tax cuts and generous subsidies, Washington was unwittingly financing the American decline.  Grove proposed a “jobs-centric economic theory” to stop the bleeding and launch the American restoration. He suggested an extra tax could be levied on multinationals for their products made by offshore labor but sold to US consumers. The revenue would finance a general fund to assist companies that intend to scale up their new production in America instead of shipping jobs and technological skills to foreign countries. CEOs and corporate directors whose companies are shrinking the US industrial base would be reminded that their personal rewards depended upon the industrial strength of the home country, which they have been systematically dismantling. “If what I’m suggesting sounds protectionist, so be it,” Grove wrote. “If the result is a trade war, treat it like other wars—fight to win.” It sounded like Donald Trump might have been channeling Andy Grove. After millions or billions of words, we still don’t know what Clinton really thinks about globalization. *  *  * Many House and Senate Democrats might want to push fundamental trade reforms, but they have a problem. Her name is Hillary Rodham Clinton. Their newly chosen party leader is by nature a cautious and defensive politician, and she finessed the subject of trade reform during the long presidential campaign. While Trump pounded “stupid trade deals,” HRC concentrated on worthy social and economic reforms. After millions or billions of words, we still don’t know what she really thinks about globalization. Yet Clinton will inherit the public anger if she has nothing substantive to say about big change. The party’s progressive ranks will probably form a loose caucus of the usual suspects to give her a push, and they won’t wait patiently to do so. No time for happy talk and no honeymoon for Hillary. If Clinton assumes the anger has faded and she can ignore it, she will be preparing for a one-term presidency. While Trump led to the GOP crackup, a Clinton II presidency might generate a parallel clash among Democrats. In olden days, the Democratic Party would have naturally stood up for the working class and organized labor. But the New Democrats of the Clinton-Obama era backed away from both. New Dems are more comfortably aligned with business and banking elites, as well as professionals with progressive social values. The first decisive test for Clinton will arrive even before she can take the office. President Obama and the business lobby are planning to push through the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal in the lame-duck session of Congress right after the election. HRC says she is opposed, but the White House has wired the deal with the GOP. If they prevail, it will instantly ruin the legitimacy of Clinton’s presidency. If she claims she is opposed, who will believe her? The arrogant corporate establishment would be rigging government in the face of public anger, abetted by the lame-duck Democratic administration.   Political reporters in 2016 narrowly portrayed Trump’s angry voters as only aging white guys who lost their factory jobs. But the victims of depressed incomes and lost prospects are a far more diverse assemblage of wounded Americans. They share the same hurt and insecurities across their differences of race, religion, ad ethnic loyalties. Rump-group rebel Democrats in the Senate are in the minority, but they will have the voters on their side. The ranks of the discontented include millions of Democratic voters—working-class African Americans and Latinos, young people struggling to get started, women seeking equity and power, old liberals and young Bernie supporters. The Democratic Party could build a stable governing majority if it could figure out how to reunite all these disparate people with the white guys who share the same economic grievances.  The rump-group rebels—people like Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Jeff Merkley, and Sherrod Brown—are definitely in the minority, but they will have the voters overwhelmingly on their side. And that potentially includes lots of Trump voters, too. In theses troubled times, the old politics of class solidarity can become the new politics of fundamental reform. Democrats must learn again how to listen to these neglected citizens—really listen—in order to create an economic agenda that speaks concretely to what people want and need. In practical terms, this means reinventing an old-fashioned political party that gains its power from organized people instead of organized money. *  *  * Oddly enough, the next great trade debate has already started in Washington circles. In recent weeks, various establishment voices have been churning out their views in blogs and op-ed columns in leading newspapers. Their new theme is sympathy for the losers. But their real objective is to define the limits of acceptable thinking in the coming political debate. None of them accept blame for the wreckage their globalization doctrine caused Americans, much less offer apologies to the victims. The wise men of Wall Street and Washington are clearly nervous, however, about the rebellious direction of 2016 politics. In The Washington Post, financier Robert Rubin, architect of Clintonomics, offered a grab bag of business-school clichés he titled “Inclusive Growth.” “Develop innovative measures to address ongoing wage and job pressure,” Rubin suggested. “Restore a sense of common purpose.” Nice words that don’t say anything. My translation: “Please don’t shoot us bankers.” Leaders of the Brookings Institution and American Enterprise Institute—two corporate fronts that pose as academic think tanks—offered similar bromides and sounded more anxious. Despite the sweet talk, their corporate agenda hasn’t really changed. It still includes cutting corporate taxes, subjecting regulation to rigorous cost-benefit calculations, shrinking Social Security and other federal programs that common folks value greatly. But I encountered a shocking deviation from a most unlikely source—Lawrence Summers. He was Rubin’s sidekick in the Clinton administration and succeeded him as Bill Clinton’s Treasury Secretary. Time magazine famously dubbed Rubin and Summers and Fed chairman Alan Greenspan as the “Committee to Save the World.” A few years later, their world famously crashed in the Great Recession. Now Larry Summers sounds like a heretic. In a July column in The Washington Post, Summers abandoned the elite faith in globalization and urged instead a new doctrine he calls “responsible nationalism.” With both NAFTA and China’s admission to the World Trade Organization, he acknowledged “the most extravagant predicted benefits have not materialized.” The popular rebellion of 2016, he said, indicates “the willingness of publics to be intimidated by experts into supporting cosmopolitan outcomes appears, for the moment, to have been exhausted.” The former Harvard president suddenly sounds vaguely populist. Summers proposed a commonsense way to think about reforming the US trading system: A new approach has to begin from the idea that the basic responsibility of government is to maximize the welfare of citizens, not to pursue some abstract concept of the global good.… It may be inevitable that impersonal forces of technology and changing global economic circumstances have profound effects. But it adds insult to injury when governments reach agreements that further cede control to international tribunals of one sort or another. This is especially the case when, for legal reasons or reasons of practicality, corporations have disproportionate influence in shaping global agreements. Read his words again and you can glimpse a rough blueprint for reforming the US approach to globalization. Summers, in fact, is reversing the harsh top-down priorities he and other Clintonistas enforced when they were in power. He is now putting people first in the national interest and subordinating corporate power.  Summers doesn’t have answers for every disorder he cites. But he does ask some stinging questions. Why should the global system prevent sovereign nations from limiting inflows of foreign capital in their economies? Why should a country be prohibited from shielding its citizens from GMO crops? Why do corporations have the right to their own private legal system, the “investor state,” where they can sue a nation for damages if it enacts environmental regulations that threaten corporate profits? NAFTA created this bizarre arrangement and the TPP proposes to expand it (see my Nation article from 2003, “Rolling Back the 20th Century”). Summers has evidently switched sides. When he was in power with Clinton and Obama, he was a ruthless advocate of corporate privilege and bankers first. Summers now insists that new trade agreements must be different: “judged not by how much is harmonized or by how many barriers to global commerce are torn down but by whether people as workers, consumers and voters are empowered.” Summers almost sounds like a Bernie Sanders revolutionary. But can we trust him? Alas, no. I once wrote a Nation blog about Summers titled “Professor Pants on Fire.” A friend of mine suggests he is slyly lobbying again to become Federal Reserve chair, the post Summers was denied when left-liberal progressives (myself included) stormed against his appointment and Janet Yellen got the job. He may once again be playing a double game, hopeful no one will catch up with his contradictions. Unfortunately for him, there is WikiLeaks. Earlier this year, the professor urged the Clinton campaign not to indulge in “bank bashing.” John Podesta, Clinton’s campaign chairman, dismissed his message as “the worst advice ever.” Nevertheless, I suggest that reform activists can test his sincerity. Invite Summers to join their fight for reform and advise them on strategy. He is a brainy guy. He could become a sophisticated ally in the fight ahead. If he turns out to be a fake, take charge of his sound ideas and dump him hard. Meanwhile, there is another important document people can consult  to get a stronger understanding of the battlefield for reforming the trading system. It’s called “The New Rules of the Road: A Progressive Approach to Globalization.” The co-authors are two heavyweight intellectuals—Lori Wallach and Jared Bernstein—and longstanding critics of corporate-led globalization. They believe the system has reached a tipping point in both small-democratic rebellion and economic distress.  “The current ‘trade’ agreement process,” Wallach and Bernstein write, “has been co-opted by corporate interests whose goal is to establish binding, enforceable global rules that protect their investments and profits. The corporate capture comes at the expense of both peoples’ rights to democratically govern their own affairs and the ability of sovereign governments to effectively enforce worker, consumer and environmental safeguards.” Their prose is clear and uncompromising. They recite the new rules that the country must embrace if it is to get back on track and rebalance society. The process is necessarily long term. It took a generation to disassemble things. But this document is an epochal rebuke to the governing elites that have owned both political parties for the last generation. The Wallach and Bernstein text is not just another trade debate; they have raised the political stakes in honest language and shocking detail. They accuse the globalists of stealing self-government from the American people.  Once this assertion is on the table in plain English, it becomes a stark challenge to citizens, not just their elected representatives. Will citizens rise to the crisis of democracy and fight back? Or will they shrug off their embarrassment and settle for the status of weaklings? I am an optimist about America for the long run, because I know the American story well enough to know about the long delays and detours that frustrated the yearnings for justice or simple fairness. There are lots of cruel chapters when people did not redeem their principles. At the risk of sounding melodramatic, I sense that we are again at one of those testing moments. © 2015 The Nation William Greider William Greider is national affairs correspondent for The Nation.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Details of Dell’s “Stack” Windows 10 Mobile Intel device surface 2 by Michael Allison  @Mkeallison Nov 8, 2016 at 19:35 GMT1 week ago Earlier this year, Evan Blass (EV Leaks), promised Windows phone fans something that would “blow their minds”, and with the revelation of the Dell Stack, this may well be so. Last weekend, images were leaked of an unknown Windows 10 Mobile device which was later identified to be a Dell Windows 10 Mobile device. The device now has a name – the Dell Stack. Much like the HP Falcon (x3) and Cityman/Talkman (950/XL), the Stack isn’t its actual name, it is just the name of the internal project. In a report originating from VentureBeat’s Evan Blass, the Dell Stack (While the Stack refers to the ecosystem of devices, I will be using the Stack to refer to the main device as well as the “stack” of devices for brevity’s sake) was an ecosystem of devices – or stack – focused around a 6.4 inch Full HD mini tablet/phablet style device which would be the brains for a desktop, laptop and tablet-like experience. How? Microsoft’s Continuum, a feature which was introduced in Build 2015 and made its real-life debut with the 950 and 950 XL, would have been the lynch-pin between these devices. To provide a refresher, Continuum allows a Windows 10 Mobile device to extend its screen from a mobile device to larger screens as long it can connect to it either wired using a cable or a dock or wirelessly via Miracast. The device can be used to gain a PC lite experience similarly to Windows RT. You wouldn’t be able to run Windows 10 desktop (x86) apps on it, but you’d be able to support Windows 10 Universal Apps on it , allowing to you edit documents in Word, create notebooks in OneNote and manage files with one of the many Universal Windows file manager apps present in the store. Update: Evan Blass says the device appears to run Full Windows when docked, making it a unique device for Windows phones, and mobile devices in general. While it was believed that the tablet had been killed due to the purge of Intel’s mobile division, VentureBeat has revealed that the review wasn’t based on Intel’s Mobile processors in the first place, but instead would have been run on Intel’s Kaby Lake processors, bringing a true laptop like experience to Windows 10 Mobile. It would have featured between 4GB to 8GB of RAM (the first on a mobile device), with 128GB and 256GB of Storage coming along for the ride. There is also a second generation planned, making this – like the HP Elite x3 – a long term play. The device appears to be very similar to HP’s Elite x3 in concept. Rather than an Intel processor powering the device though, the HP Elite x3 has a powerful Snapdragon 820 inside it. Like Dell’s Stack, it powers a host of accessories and can be said to be a futuristic device which aims to bridge computing from the concept of devices and the cloud to that od devices and screens. Microsoft’s Continuum is an attempt to  do that as well, and with the improvements to Continuum planned with future Windows 10 Mobile releases, perhaps Microsoft may just be integral to the next shift in mobile computing.

This should come as no surprise to those who’ve long perceived the Mac platform as inward-looking, limited in compatibility, and generally worse value for money than comparable Windows alternatives. Pros are smart with their tools and their money, after all. But the change with Apple’s 2016 generation of MacBook Pros is that those downsides have been amped up — more expensive and less compatible than ever before — to an extreme that exposes the fallacy of the continued use of the Pro moniker. These are Apple’s premium laptops, its deluxe devices, but not in any meaningful way computers tailored for the pros. A MacBook Pro is now simply what you buy if you’re in the Apple ecosystem and have a higher budget and expectations than the MacBook can fulfill. Those complaining about Apple's current Mac lineup are not haters, they're lovers. They've spent 10+ years and 5+ figures on Macs. — Jeff J. (@lapcatsoftware) October 29, 2016 The backlash from among pro Mac users that’s arisen in the wake of this new product launch is unprecedented, drowning out even the widespread grumbling about the loss of the headphone jack from the iPhone 7 just a month prior. Just take a look at this studious blog post from Michael Tsai, which gathers together the broad negative consensus from among Apple's most passionate followers. The Mac community finds the specs underwhelming, even on the 15-inch model, which uses power-sipping AMD Radeon graphics instead of the world-conquering Nvidia Pascal chips. Emotions are running so low that people are even speculating about whether Apple should do with the Mac what IBM did when it sold off the ThinkPad line to Lenovo. This is partially because Apple hasn’t had a class-leading professional Mac computer for years — the Mac Pro is 1,054 days old now — and the new laptops have given an outlet and reason for expectant fans to vent. Many people were clinging on to their aging MacBook Pros in the vain hope of seeing a major spec and performance upgrade that simply didn’t materialize, and that's been frustrating. Here's how the 15" #MacBookPro 2016 component specs compare to the 2012 model: CPU: +8.9% to +13% MEM: +33% GPU: +53% to +184% /cc @mjtsai pic.twitter.com/uucjBzXe6C— Felix Schwarz (@felix_schwarz) October 28, 2016 The updated MacBooks from Apple have newer chips, but not that much newer, with Apple using yesteryear’s Intel Skylake CPUs and not this year’s Kaby Lake. They have faster storage, which is an indisputable benefit, but they also max out at 16GB of RAM. For consumer or casual use, that’s perfectly adequate, but "for a developer work machine, 16GB is the uncomfortable minimum requirement," as web developer Baldur Bjarnason points out. Apple seems surprised by the predictable backlash at betraying the trust of its most loyal customers Here’s the thing: if these new MacBooks simply didn’t carry the Pro label, we’d all have a lot less to complain about. It’s perfectly okay for a company to craft expensive, niche devices that will only match the particular needs of a select group of people. But over the course of the past decade or two, the entire tech industry has moved away from labeling things as exclusive or luxurious, opting for more inclusive language. If you can’t afford the premium model, that implies you’re not wealthy enough; but if you can’t afford the pro version, maybe you’re just not that into it. A subtle, but important distinction. And so it is, that we’re now living in a world populated by the PS4 Pro, DJI Mavic Pro, Surface Pro, iPad Pro, Beats Pro, Logitech Pro Gaming Mouse, and many others. Those of us old enough to remember ATI, the Canadian graphics card company that was taken over by AMD, will remember it pioneered many of these tags with such historic GPUs as the Radeon 9500 Pro, 9800 SE, X800 XT, and so on. They’re all meaningless as far as the company is concerned, but it just so happens that the "Pro" appendage is more meaningful to users than slapping on a "Plus" or "XL." With the obvious exception of leisure-time devices like the PlayStation console, a "pro" piece of consumer electronics is generally interpreted as a signal to actual professionals that this machine is for them. I'm out of apologia juice for defending Apple going with 4 USB-C ports on the new MacBook over a useful mix and keeping the MagSafe. — DHH (@dhh) October 28, 2016 Apple’s folly is in not recognizing just how passionate and committed its professional audience is. But the company should already know that all the iOS app developers that generate its unparalleled third-party software ecosystem are doing their work on Macs. It should be aware of their RAM requirements and the improvements they most want to see. "Pro" used to mean something when it came at the end of MacBook model names Beyond developers, there are the photographers and video producers that have made Mac computers the central hub of their home and work studios for many years, thanks to Apple’s early prioritization of high-quality displays and intuitive software. Leaving them without an SD card slot or an included adapter runs entirely counter to Apple’s fundamental principles of having a coherent ecosystem and a more user-friendly approach than the (previously) cold and aloof Windows PC manufacturers. Apple used to be a friend to creative professionals, and now that it’s acting against their wishes and interests, it seems surprised at their impassioned negative response. The backlash to the new MacBook Pro is so bad that Apple has slashed its accessory prices and LG's monitors to appease. Seems unprecedented — Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) November 7, 2016 MacBook Pros were once professional computers that could also appeal to an aspiring consumer audience. They were pricey for a general-purpose laptop, but justifiable as a luxury purchase or as a device that pays for itself by making its user more efficient and productive. But today MacBook Pros are very definitely consumer devices that only gesture toward a professional audience without truly endeavoring to appease it. The new Touch Bar is not a pro feature. It’s cool, it works really well, and it has tons of potential for the future, but it clashes with professional workflows, many of which involve external monitors and keyboards. Apple showed how DJs might use it, but those same people would probably prefer to have dongle-free USB ports for the rest of their gear and a MagSafe charging adapter in the event of some inebriated clubber tripping over their cables. None of Apple's additions improve professional workflows yet, and its subtractions will lead to plenty of headaches The ultra-flat keyboard with 0.55mm key travel is also not professionally minded. Its purpose is overall thinness, but I know of no app developers, globetrotting businesspeople, or digital artists that had "more thinness" anywhere near the top of their priority list of MacBook Pro improvements. Professional writers might have asked for more tactile response, not less, and Apple's keyboard alterations seem to primarily serve to optimize and harmonize its design rather than enhance any functionality. Apple’s 2016 MacBook Pros carry on the Pro moniker dishonestly. At least we should all hope that's the case — because if Apple actually believes that these new laptops are suitable and sufficient for intensive professional needs, then the company's long and happy relationship with creatives may be heading toward a calamitous breakup.

This, it appears, is the company's raison d'etre, going by the CEO's comments, so we expect much from the San Diego-based firm. Part of this strategy to win over the hearts and minds of well-heeled gamers is the launch of the Razer Blade Stealth - a 12.5in touchscreen-enabled ultrabook whose real claim to fame is the ability to run high-quality graphics by mating, via Thunderbolt, to a graphics card-housing enclosure known as the Core. Now, in late 2016, Razer has updated the Blade Stealth to the 7th Generation Intel Kaby Lake CPU platform and increased the battery size by 15 per cent whilst still keeping the svelte form factor intact. And the latest iteration is a good-looking thing. Measuring 321mm wide, 206mm deep, 13.1mm high and tipping the scales at around 1.3kg, it's eminently slim and portable. Build quality is above average for the £999 starting price thanks to premium aluminium construction, though bear in mind that the matte finish is a fingerprint magnet of the highest order. Razer keeps the same 12.5in IGZO LED-backlit display used on the model from earlier in the year, and it's notable that it's touchscreen enabled on what is advertised as a gamer-centric machine. Available in either QHD (2,560x1,440) or UHD (3,840x2,160) panels, offering up to 70 per cent and 100 per cent of the Adobe RGB space, respectively, it's one area where Razer believes it scores very well. You won't fail to notice the large bezel surrounding the screen. Razer's reason for not having a sexy, edge-to-edge display, such as on the Dell XPS 13, rests with 'deciding to pick function over form and selecting the best display on the planet'. Lofty words indeed, though the fat borders are very conspicuous, and the coating on the panel is hugely reflective. Our sample's QHD display is bright and sharp while, under Windows 10, the multi-touch facility works as well as any other laptop we've tested recently, responding well to gestures and having excellent accuracy. It's at least as good as the Surface Pro 4 that I personally own, and our sample exhibited no noticeable backlight bleed or uneven lighting. Keeping a super-svelte form factor usually means sacrificing ports and interfaces. Razer uses a Thunderbolt 3 (USB Type-C) for charging and connecting to the Core dock we spoke about above. There's also a couple of USB 3.0 - one on each side - a 3.5mm headphone jack, and a HDMI 2.0a port through which you can hook up an external monitor and carry 8-channel sound. Laptop sound is produced by a downward-firing speaker on the right-hand side. The audio oomph is surprisingly impressive from such a small unit, too. Killer, meanwhile, is the go-to choice for networking and Bluetooth. This wouldn't be a Razer product if it didn't have an RGB-equipped keyboard. Nothing has changed from the version available earlier in the year though this is no bad thing. The keys are individually lit and can be set to one of 16.8m colours using the Synapse software. What's more, the brightness of the lighting effect can be changed, too. There's a small amount of flex if you push down hard in the middle. Perhaps more obvious is the very shallow travel, which feels like the Surface Pro 4 Type Cover and less like a conventional laptop. The overall experience isn't poor by any means - you quickly get used to it - but we'd prefer more travel if working on it for an extended period of time. Given the spatial restrictions imposed by a small-ish chassis, the keys don't feel too small or cramped. The trackpad, meanwhile, is of a good size and supports four-finger-touch gestures. Razer keeps the same 128GB, 256GB and 512GB Samsung family of PCIe-based NVMe storage drives but ups the capacity to 1TB for the 4K model. The travel charger is also compact, adding 220g to the overall weight. Under the hood, three new hardware additions bulk up the performance potential. Razer now uses a Core i7-7500U Kaby Lake CPU whose dual-core, quad-threaded frequency changes from a base 2.7GHz to a maximum 3.5GHz. The configurable-TDP chip is nominally rated at a 15W TDP and we observed it maintaining 3.2GHz during our all-core benchmarks. Performance should be 10 or so per cent higher than the early-2016's Core i7-6500U version through a combination of more frequency and enhanced architecture. The graphics are now known as HD 620 and dynamically boost to 1.05GHz. An option now exists for the Blade Stealth to be outfitted with 16GB of LPDDR3 1,866 memory, up from a solitary 8GB, and this is how our sample shipped. And last but not least, Razer's larger battery should pave the way for longer mains-free time than the original model, which was often found to last no more than five hours with basic load. A key selling point of the Blade Stealth is the ability to connect to an external box that houses a discrete graphics card. The Core, to be priced at close to £500 for the enclosure alone, is a meaty unit that supports both AMD and Nvidia dual-slot graphics cards measuring up to 310mm long. Usage couldn't be simpler: simply slide out the main tray, install the graphics card (our choice was an EVGA GTX 1080 FTW), attach power cables - the unit comes with 2x8-pin - and slide back. The Core has a 500W Enhance PSU capable of driving cards with up to 375W TDP. The Core also houses four USB 3.0 ports and Gigabit Ethernet, too, making it a desktop replacement bit of kit. Plugged into the mains at one end and a Thunderbolt 3, 40Gbps connection to the charging inlet of the Blade Stealth, the Synapse software immediately recognises the Core and seamlessly changes graphics from the integrated Intel to whatever's in the box. Being Razer, the Core has two-zone RGB lighting controlled by the software. The Core's PSU can be heard at all times, more of a hum than a din, and the overall design is good enough to ensure the card doesn't throttle. Our EVGA GTX 1080 ran at 1,920MHz boost core whilst gaming, but as you will see later on in the review, performance wasn't where we would normally expect it to be. The base £999 price includes the QHD display and 128GB of solid-state storage. Upping this to 256GB and memory to 16GB - the next SKU up - increases the price to £1,249, which is exactly how our review sample is configured. Enough talk, now on to some numbers.

But the octocopter in the video below used a prototype of a new compact, military-style radar system to detect its surroundings and track other aircraft. As the drone takes off, you can see the traces of barbed wire fences and trees in the radar image on the left. Later, the radar detects another drone nearby and tracks its progress. In other tests the system showed it could detect a small single-propeller plane and an ultralight aircraft. The technology, from startup Echodyne, could address a major challenge holding up dreams like Amazon’s plan to deliver packages by drone. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration says that systems that enable drones to detect and avoid other aircraft are needed before they can be allowed to operate out of the sight of supervising humans (see “Now You Can Finally Use Your Drone to Make Money”). Currently, no solution exists. Companies such as Intel and startup Skydio have shown systems that use cameras to sense and steer around ground-level objects such as trees (see "Daredevil Drone Flies Through Trees Like an Ace"). But they don’t have the range needed to avoid aircraft when flying hundreds of feet off the ground. Echodyne says the radar system it will release early in 2017 can fill that gap. The company has developed a way to shrink a component called a phase shifter needed for a radar to scan its beam around the world to identify and track objects (see “Metamaterial Radar May Improve Drone and Car Vision”). Electronically scanning radar is currently mostly limited to military uses, because existing phase shifters are bulky and complex, and can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Eben Frankenberg, CEO and cofounder of Echodyne, says that multiple drone companies are already testing his technology, but declines to name them, citing nondisclosure agreements. The company is also testing its radars on cars, with a view to helping efforts to build autonomous vehicles. Prototype driverless cars rely heavily on lidar, which uses laser light to build up a picture of the world (see “Fist-Sized Laser Scanner to Make Autonomous Cars Less Ugly”). Electronically scanning radar can’t collect such a detailed image of the shape of objects. But Frankenberg says it has other benefits. For example, because radar uses radio waves and not light, rain and snow aren’t a problem, the range is greater, and it can instantly report back on the speed at which cars and other things are moving, he says.

Together, they are competing in that market with Broadcom. Among CPE vendors, Hitron Technologies Americas demonstrated a DOCSIS 3.1 gateway powered by Intel and MaxLinear silicon at the recent SCTE/ISBE Cable-Tec Expo in Philadelphia.   “Within our operator family, the cable DOCSIS data gateway market is an exciting strategic growth platform for us particularly as we start to see initial data service deployments around the new multi gigabit cable DOCSIS 3.1 standards,” Kishore Seendripu, MaxLinear’s CEO, said Monday on the company’s Q3 call.   He said the “bigger part of the ramp” is expected to occur in the second of 2017.  “We have not yet seen what I call a stronger part of the ramp for DOCSIS 3.1 yet, and the current expectation is still it's going to be a second half phenomenon.”   Several cable operators, including Comcast, WideOpenWest, Midco, RCN, among others, have been rolling out or trialing 1-Gig residential services using DOCSIS 3.1.   RELATED: Comcast Sets DOCSIS 3.1 Expansion, Launches 1-Gig in Detroit   Though MaxLinear continues to wind-down the video SoC business it has as part of its 2015 acquisition of Entropic, Seendripu noted that silicon for Multimedia over Coax Alliance (MoCA) remains an “increasingly strategic part of our business.” MoCA is a speedy, video-focused home networking technology for in-home coax networks, used primarily for whole-home DVRs and WiFi adapters and bridges.   Of recent note, MaxLinear demonstrated a new multi-gigabit MoCA 2.5 platform at a CableLabs-run conference. MoCA introduced the 2.5 spec in April.   While the MoCA 2.5 chips are sampling now, Seendripu expects revenues for the company’s MoCA 2.1 chip to start in mid-2017.   MoCA 2.1 is a firmware feature and extension of MoCA 2.0 that supports throughputs of 500 Mbps and a 1 Gbps “bonded” outputs along other components aimed to set a migration path toward MoCA 2.5.   MaxLinear posted Q3 revenues of $96.3 million, up 1% year-on-year, and net income of $9.7 million (14 cents per share), down from year-ago net income of $22.6 million (33 cents per share).  The company expects Q4 revenues of between $85 million and $89 million.  Want to read more stories like this?

(Photo Credit: U.S Army CERDEC photoKelly White) VIEW ORIGINAL BALTIMORE (Nov. 7, 2016) - The U.S. Army's platform community has been faced with challenges in keeping pace with the rapid evolution of technology, and no matter how great the technology is provided to the Soldier, it has minimal impact if it cannot be effectively integrated in a timely fashion, officials said. Aberdeen Proving Ground organizations discussed hardware/software convergence during MILCOM 2016 at the Baltimore Convention Center Nov. 1. The U.S. Army Material Command's Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center, or CERDEC, is working to improve the engineering agility of the Army's systems and trying to improve the command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, or C4ISR, systems to provide faster technological advancement in the field for the Soldier. "The threat is very dynamic," said Mark Kitz, acting director of System of Systems Engineering for Program Executive Office Intelligence, Electronic Warfare and Sensors. "The communications infrastructures that we have today is very brittle and fragile to how we conduct our jamming operations of tomorrow." Kitz was joined by CERDEC Intelligence and Information Warfare Directorate's Intel Technology and Architecture Branch Chief Benjamin Peddicord and CERDEC Space and Terrestrial Communications Directorate systems engineer Ronald Kane. "To me, the most important problem we are trying to address is that it takes too long to deploy new capabilities to the field," Peddicord said. "So if we accept the idea that we can't predict the future and that we need to be agile, we need to be able to adapt our systems to a changing environment, then we need to build them differently. We need to do something different so we can drop in new capabilities rapidly." The Army's science and technology community is addressing the challenges with a uniform open-system architecture, which will allow for faster, more flexible hardware and software upgrades for the tactical edge by replacing a capability processing card. This effort is known as hardware/software convergence. One of the solutions CERDEC is currently working on is building truly modular systems to allow new capability to be dropped in without have to tear out all of the existing capabilities. This eliminates the number of boxes on platforms, as well as reduce redundant government-off-the-shelf items and save time, money and other logistical burdens associated with retrofits back at the Army's depots. Not only will this enable the agility of the Army to deal with unprecedented future needs, it will also help to reduce platform size, weight, power and cooling aspects, and help reduce redundant systems on these platforms. In the long term it will save time, money and things related to logistics support associated with the future retro fits to these platforms. ---- The U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center is part of the U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command, which has the mission to provide innovative research, development and engineering to produce capabilities that provide decisive overmatch to the Army against the complexities of the current and future operating environments in support of the joint warfighter and the nation. RDECOM is a major subordinate command of the U.S. Army Materiel Command.

More Comments LinkedIn Tumblr Pinterest Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon So, remember a few weeks back when the House reopened for business and the government had to table hundreds of pages of documents in response to written questions that had been submitted by MPs before the summer recess? And how more than a few of those replies led to seriously, if fleetingly embarrassing headlines for Team Trudeau, including, perhaps most notably, a major House hullaballoo over thousands of dollars in taxpayer-subsidized moving expenses racked up by the prime minister’s two top aides, who eventually announced that they’d be refunding part of the money? If so, you probably also recall that, even as reporters were flipping frantically through those replies in search of news-or-outrage-worthy tidbits, opposition researchers were filing a whole new batch of politically pointed requests for detailed information on everything from the booze tab for international trips to the size and scope of the government’s fleet of luxury cars to the cost of landscaping and swimming pool upkeep on the diplomatic circuit. Related Cost of passengers’ food and drinks on Trudeau flights to Philippines, Turkey — $1,300 per person Trudeau will reimburse government for (some of the) costs of family travel to exclusive Caribbean resort Top Trudeau aides apologize for moving expenses controversy, vow to repay ‘significant portion’ Under standing orders, the government had 45 days to reply, and on Friday, they dutifully tabled the first volume of responses to many – although not all – of the questions added to the order paper during the first few days of the fall sitting. The remaining files – which should include that luxury car count—should be tabled when MPs return next week. So, what have we learned so far? Presented in descending order by potential to provide opposition parties with political hay-making opportunities, here are some of the highlights of the responses made available for perusal thus far. (It can take a few days for written responses, particularly lengthy ones, to be scanned into the system.) Full cost of Justin Trudeau’s 3-day trip to the “summer camp for billionaires” in Sun Valley, Idaho It’s a good bet that when MPs gather for the first post-hiatus question period on Monday, Conservative MP Kevin Sorenson – or a Conservative colleague – will be asking Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to outline just what Canadian taxpayers got in return for the $121,875 they shelled out for his July trip to Sun Valley, Idaho to attend a hyper-exclusive conference hosted by American investment firm Allen & Company that has been described as a “summer camp for billionaires.” Included under that final tab: $49,000 in Challenger travel time plus $1,038 to cater the flight, $18,381.01 on meals, accommodation and other incidentals, $36,099 in overtime and $17,359.82 in other trip-related expenses for the security team that accompanied the prime minister. Trudeau will, of course, undoubtedly defend the trip as part of his ongoing campaign to attract investment – particularly high tech – to Canada, a claim at least partially bolstered by the list of “meeting scenarios” on “foreign direct investment” prepared by Privy Council officials, which includes suggested talking points for tête-à-têtes with the heads of some of the best-known brands on the planet, including Samsung, Intel, Google, Apple,Twitter, Snapchat, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft and IBM, among others. But that doesn’t mean the opposition parties can’t grumble over the cost of the trip. Alcohol consumption and cost on government-owned aircraft Thanks to a question from Conservative MP Guy Lauzon, the numbers are in: Between November 13 and September 7th, 231 bottles of wine and 535 cans of beer have been downed by passengers – including staff, security and members of the travelling press – while on board government-owned Airbus and Challenger aircraft, for a combined tab of $6,053.41. That includes drinks served over the course of seven separate international trips with a combined duration of approximately 40 days, although obviously, not all that time was spent in the air. The most expensive trip was a 7-day trek from Ottawa to Antalya, then onto Manila and back to Ottawa, which came in at $1,222,29 for 41 bottles of wine and 58 cans of beer, but as far as volume of alcohol consumed, the booziest junket was the 10-day tour of China in August, which went through 54 bottles of wine and 83 cans of beer for a relatively modest $923 total. The cheapest was a three-day trip to Washington in March, during which just 8 bottles of wine and 34 cans of beer went down the collective hatch for a total cost of just $183.05. In an explanatory note signed by Foreign Affairs Minister Stephane Dion explains that the service of both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages for “official delegations on international flights” has been “standard practice since the 1970s.” It also points out that media outlets with reporters travelling on the plane “are charged a flat fee which includes all services associated with flights on the Prime Minister’s plane, including any beverages they may consume.” A separate reply from Public Safety notes, somewhat sternly, that “the consumption of alcohol is not permitted on RCMP aircraft.” Insecure storage and handling of classified and secret documents At first glance, this reply – which was filed in response to a query from Conservative MP Gord Brown – appeared to have the potential to put the government on the defensive over what seemed a distressingly laissez-faire approach to handling sensitive information. It revealed that, since the Liberals took over last fall, there have been literally thousands of instances in which “it was discovered that classified or protected documents were left or stored in a manner that did not meet the requirements of the security level of the documents,” some of which took place within the offices of ministerial staff. But as it turns out, such breaches can be as (comparatively) minor as inadvertently leaving a folder on one’s desk overnight – in which case the documents are “seized by security” during the evening sweeps, with a note left for the owner “advising of the infraction,” which is also relayed to “responsible management” – or failing to lock up a filing cabinet that may or may not contain confidential material. The log also covers the entire public service, as well as staff employed by a stand-alone agency, crown corporation or other entity funded in whole or in part by the government, which makes the total number of incidents seem a bit less unsettling, as does the fact that not one employee has lost their security clearance as a result of an infraction. Among the agencies obliged to acknowledge such breaches was the ultra-secretive Communications Security Establishment, which reported 491 incidents over the past year, although the spy agency makes a point of explaining that these glitches “occurred exclusively within CSE’s building,” and that “no documents or classified assets left the building and there was no risk to the classified information.” Plus, it goes on to point out, CSE operations take place within a “high security zone,” which means that any employee authorized to be there has to be cleared to top secret/special intelligence level. The Canadian Security Intelligence Service, meanwhile, reported 659 breaches, although only 12 “required further investigation” and no one had their clearance revoked as a result. Landscaping and pool maintenance costs Meanwhile, when it comes to landscaping, gardening and swimming pool-related expenses, Canada’s outpost in New Delhi is the most high-maintenance property abroad, at least on the expense front. According to the chart provided by the government, since the Liberals officially took over last November, Global Affairs has shelled out a total of $107,042 on groundskeeping, as well as an additional $7,614 to keep the pool in (presumably) pristine condition. The priciest stand-alone tab for pool services, however, was in Algiers, where the embassy spent $46,252 – almost half the total reported grounds-keeping budget. The lowest – at least, amongst residences that included a separate subtotal for pool costs– was $41 in Wellington, although there were many residences that listed no separate pool-related expenses at all. Canada’s mission to Latvia in Riga reported just $17 in maintenance costs, which scarcely seems like enough to pay someone to water the plants every few days. Ministerial swag In retrospect, it was a perhaps fatally oddly worded question: Conservative MP Sylvie Boucher requested the particulars of any and all “clothing given by government department or agencies for ministers or their exempt staff.” As it turns out, while there may be a few perks that accompany an appointment to cabinet, a wardrobe full of free-for-the-asking departmental swag does not appear to be among them. According to the 73-page, government-wide reply, as of this fall, only two ministers have received articles of clothing from their respective departments: Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale, who, “as lead spokesman for the department, was provided with a (Public Safety) windbreaker to wear during events such as media availabilities,” although the reply stresses that the jacket is “on loan,” and “will be returned, as was his predecessor’s, once he ceases to be the minister.” Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan, who seemingly will at least get to keep the Joint Task Force 2 and 435 Squadron golf shirts and HMCS Calgary t-shirt and “ball caps” that he has collected over his tenure thus far, as, presumably, will his press secretary and senior policy advisor, who were also given HMCS Calgary hats. The total estimated value for all of the above, minus the JTF shirt, is $105. It’s hard not to wonder whether Boucher – or, more specifically, the researcher who drafted the question – was hoping for a response that would fuel at least a modest wave of outrage over Liberal entitlement.

U.S. stocks on Monday had their best day since March on a percentage basis after the Federal Bureau of Investigation said its review of a new batch of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's emails won't lead to charges. Gains were broad, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average reclaiming the key 18,000 level and the S&P 500 snapping its nine-day losing streak, the longest since 1980. The slide had been attributed partly to polls showing a closer contest between Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump. The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 371.32 points, or 2.1%, to close at 18,259.60. The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 119.80 points, or 2.4%, to end at 5,166.17. The S&P 500 index rose 46.34 points, or 2.2%, to finish at 2,131.52. Financials, industrials, health care and technology paced the advance. The controlled action likely came with the understanding that the presidential race remains fairly tight. In the financial sector, Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan Chase each gained more than 3%. In the technology sector, Dow components Intel and Microsoft gained 3.2% and 3.0%, respectively. Intel finished at the top of the price-weighted average. Today's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit report for September. Total outstanding consumer credit increased by $19.3 billion in September (consensus $17.5 billion) after increasing an upwardly revised $26.8 billion (from $25.9 billion) in August. The dollar saw big gains, with the ICE Dollar Index which measures the greenback against a half-dozen rivals, up 0.7%. Gold was down sharply, after gaining 2.2% last week. December gold ended today's session down $24.60 (-1.9%) to $1279.90/oz. December silver closed today's session $0.21 lower (-1.1%) at $18.16/oz. Oil prices rose more than 1%.

December crude oil futures rose $0.74 (+1.7%) to $44.82/barrel. Treasuries finished on a lower note as the long end of the curve underperformed. The yield on the 2-yr note finished higher by three basis points (0.82%) while the yield on the 10-yr note ended up five basis points (1.83%). Today's trading volume was above the average of 861 million as more than 889 million shares changed hands at the NYSE floor.

The attack on October 21, 2016 consisted of a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, and blocked access to thousands of websites, including Netflix, Amazon, Twitter, Airbnb, the New York Times, PayPal, and more. Immediately, suspicions centered on Russia and China as having both the motivation and the ability to plan and execute such an attack. Yet as of this writing, it is not at all clear if the attack was state-motivated. After the attack, it was reported that the Chinese and Russian hacker group known as New World Hackers assumed responsibility and claimed it was a sophisticated attack using botnets at higher-speed traffic than ever know before – 1.2 terabytes per second (Tbps) The attack exploited vast numbers of connected devices (in an announcement to the media, Dyn stated that some 100,000 devices were involved). These devices, also known as the Internet of Things (IoT), include webcams, alarm systems, baby monitors, internet-based security cameras, DVRs, printers, and routers – all connected to the internet. The attackers managed to plant a software component in these devices that could receive commands from a control server so that the masses of devices all sought out the target in a synchronized manner and paralyzed the attacked servers’ ability to function by flooding it with traffic. The vast majority of these devices lack any kind of significant defenses; access to most of the systems is ensured through default usernames and passwords installed by the manufacturer. In fact, there is no current effective concept to respond to this type of threat. The threat inherent in the swarm of connected devices is not new. As early as 2013, Symantec reported the existence of a worm called Linux.Darlloz that according to estimates, infected some 50,000 IoT connected devices, such as routers and Set Top Box devices or computers based on Intel’s X86 architecture. The goal was to install software allowing attackers to mine crypto currencies. In 2015, Symantec issued a detailed report about simplifications that make it possible to break into 50 different kinds of smart home devices. In its April 2016 report, the company stated that medical devices (such as insulin pumps, X-ray systems, and CT scanners) are also exposed to attack, as well as smart TV systems and dozens of other devices of all types. Even though the ability to penetrate these devices and carry out extensive DDoS attacks through them was not surprising, the intensity of the attacks demonstrated the destructive capability of using a large number of synchronized simple devices. The attack broke the record for the largest DDoS attack ever, which occurred in September 2016, targeting the French company OVH, at a scope of 1 Tbps; it used bots (software agents) that exploited the widespread CCTV cameras. In many respects, this is a dangerous escalation and sets a new threshold for a cyber threat that on a few levels so far has no satisfactory response. The first aspect is connected to the proliferation of these devices. In the US, there are about 25 connected devices per every 100 people, and this is just the beginning of the trend. Gartner Inc. estimates that in 2016 the world will have 6.4 billion connected devices, and that by 2020 that number will approach 21 billion. Such a vast number of devices creates a significant weakness for the web and allows attackers of various sorts to use them for any number of goals. The new twist in the most recent attack was the simplicity with which it was carried out. Millions of devices can serve as the potential means for DDoS cyberattacks whose execution is relatively simple, because the devices create new entrance points to the internet, making the scope of the threat enormous. The threat grows even greater because end devices, such as smartphones and computers, are used to control the connected devices. The second aspect concerns the weakness of the defense. Most IoT devices lack appropriate means of security, making it easy for attacks to exploit the weaknesses of the systems operating the devices. The majority of manufacturers have yet to adopt a framework of standards and security; they generally use publicly available open code to make it possible for their devices to communicate with other similar devices in the area, and this itself generates severe security soft spots. Important corrective steps have been initiated in the United States, as security companies, manufacturer associations, and even government agencies have begun to cooperate, but these steps are far from constituting a sufficient defensive response. The third aspect regards the scope and depth of the damage. The attack on Dyn was a clear warning sign: while the offensive capabilities displayed in the attacks did not require anything particularly sophisticated, the impact was significant. The fact that the malicious code was made public prepared the ground for other attacks that will make use of this or similar code, and raises the specter that the writers of the code already possess an improved version. Thus the use of similar methods of attack will presumably be seen again, perhaps even in more powerful versions. Finally, there is privacy. One of the key problems with connected devices is securing user privacy. Connected devices are constantly collecting information about their users’ parameters, at home and in the office, including the nature of use of equipment and electrical appliances as well as wearable devices, whose use is becoming more widespread. The inherent defensive weaknesses of these devices means that all that information could be available to various attackers intent on subversion. The weakness shown in the last attack is not the burden of the private sector alone. The use of armies of connected devices is a challenge for the state, because it has the capability to harm the routine performance of governments and, worse still, disrupt performance during emergencies and in wartime. Because the risk is real, defending connected devices is an enormous challenge. In response to the attack on Dyn, the United States government was called on to enact regulation on the security of IoT products. Indeed, this seems precisely where efforts should be focused, with measures similar to the steps taken in the financial sector. Although the problem is global, Israeli entities charged with cyber security must fully understand the risk of exposure to such attacks and take action by partnering with international efforts on the issue, while at the same time taking steps to enhance the relevant defensive mechanisms and their continued performance in order to cope with this type of attack. _____________________________________ Dr. Gabi Siboni is a senior research fellow and head of the Cyber Security Program at INSS.

Many of the anti-virus and firewall protection services that are used today were improved upon with Israeli technologies. The dual processors that we use in our portable laptop computers, tablets and smart phones are based on the Israeli invention of the first microprocessor for Intel. The start-up nation with a focal point in Tel Aviv has succeeded in becoming a world-class technology development centre and a leading exporter of innovation. During a recent Digital-Life Design (DLD) Tel Aviv Innovation Festival, which was held in September, leading startup founders from 31 different countries including Kenya met with Israeli companies, startups, scientists, investors and designers. Ms Alice Mueni, head of product at totohealth, a social enterprise which aims at improving maternal health and reducing child mortality via mobile phones attended the innovation festival. The annual festival, a global gathering of innovators and entrepreneurs from around the world celebrated women entrepreneurs in the innovation festival. According to Tel Aviv-Yafo mayor, Mr Ron Huldai, the city’s ecosystem is a leader in gender equality and has been ranked the top hub for women entrepreneurs outside the United States. shaping the future He says increasing number of foreign immigrants make their way to Israel to establish their own start-ups. “Due to Israel’s small and manageable ecosystem, with tax benefits for foreigners that set up shop in the country, the number of foreign-founded start-ups in Israel is on the rise,” he says. The Compass report indicates that Tel Aviv has 20 per cent women founders in startups, while the European average is 17 per cent. The city has a growing number of programs and accelerators such as Campus for mums, a baby-friendly start-up school for new moms, run by Google in partnership with Yazamiyot, a networking group for Israeli women entrepreneurs. In the campus, women on maternity leave are given the opportunity to engage in their own entrepreneurial endeavors while taking care of their little ones in the program.

The world’s largest contract chipmaker has surged 32 percent in 2016, climbing to its highest level versus MSCI Inc.’s global gauge of technology stocks on record. The $156 billion company now accounts for 16 percent of Taiwan’s entire equity market value, the biggest proportion according to data stretching back 13 years, and none of the 33 analysts who cover it recommend selling the shares. While the company has benefited from a broader rally in technology companies this year that’s seen rivals including Intel Corp. reach multi-year highs, TSMC is luring investors with record profit as demand for Apple Inc.’s new iPhones fuels orders for its processor chips. With Samsung Electronics Co. faltering after the scrapping of its Note 7 device, Value Investment Principals Ltd. and Manulife Asset Management Co. say the stock has room to rise further. “Samsung’s issues and the perceived benefit for Apple is surely creating some optimism,” said Sandy Mehta, chief executive officer of Value Investment. “TSMC is the best in class. Valuations are not very high for TSMC, and rising estimates have led to investor optimism. The shares could still have upside.” TSMC trades at 13.9 times forward earnings, less than the MSCI global-technology gauge’s 16.3 times, while analysts project the company’s net income will increase 30 percent this quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Profit climbed 28 percent in the previous three months to NT$96.8 billion ($3.1 billion) from a year earlier. The stock dropped 0.3 percent on Tuesday. The company’s high dividend yield and reasonable valuation provide good downside protections to the share price,” said Caroline Maurer, head of Greater China equities at BNP Paribas Investment Partners in Hong Kong, whose greater China fund returned 45 percent this year to beat 99 percent of its peers.

The company will “soon” start mass production of chips using 10-nanometer processors, said Elizabeth Sun, a spokeswoman at TSMC. The smaller chip size allows handset makers more room for new hardware features. Apple Reliance Still, any doubt about the success of Apple’s products can shake investor faith in TSMC’s prospects. The Taiwan stock slid 2.6 percent last week after Apple failed to issue a robust holiday sales forecast in the wake of Samsung’s decision to stop manufacturing the Galaxy Note 7. “A lot of demand is coming from one single device and any hiccup on iPhone sales this and next year could have a big impact on TSMC,” said Mark Li, a strategist at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., who rates the stock market-perform. “Longer-term smartphone growth will deteriorate gradually, which is a headwind to the company.” Analysts remain bullish, with their consensus target price implying a 9 percent return over the next 12 months. For Catherine Kung, any correction in share prices is a buying opportunity. “Their technology is strong and it is a dominant player in advanced processes,” said Kung, a Taipei-based fund manager at Manulife Asset Management Co., whose Global Taiwan Equity Fund returned 18 percent this year, beating 94 percent of peers. “Analysts will keep revising up target prices over the next two to three years.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

GamesRadar+ Awards News Reviews Playstation Xbox Nintendo Movies More TV Cool Stuff Magazines Official Xbox Official PlayStation GamesMaster Edge SFX Total Film Search Meet the $11,000 ultra PC based on a religious artifact (and how you can build it too) By Sam Prell Shares Our friends over at sister site PC Gamer have been busy these past few weeks, putting the finishing touches on what just might be the most powerful gaming PC ever built. At least, until they decide to do it again in a few years. Say hello to The Large Pixel Collider: Some of you out there might think this sounds a bit familiar. That's because PC Gamer started the project in 2013, with a similar (albeit less visually snazzy) build. But time marches on and technology improves, and before long it was time to unveil a new Large Pixel Collider, updated for 2016. Over on PC Gamer, you can check out everything there is to know about the LPC 2016, including a dissection of each component and a video series of games running on the beast. Now for the fun part: building your own. The case and cooling are both custom, crafted by veteran modders Lee Harrington and Ron Christianson. So if you want your version of the LPC to look just as gnarly, you'll need someone with skills in arts and crafts. But if you want to dig into the guts and build something comparable in terms of specs (and you've got about $11,000 to spend, almost $4,000 of which is on the GPUs alone) here's what you need, with links to where you can buy them on Amazon: Processor: Intel Core-i7 6950X 10 cores overclocked to 4.0 GHz 25 MB cache Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 Socket LGA 2011‑3 GPU: 2x Nvidia Titan X Total 24 GB GDDR5X memory 1531 MHz boost clock Motherboard: ASUS ROG Rampage V Edition 10 Metal-reinforced PCIe slots SupremeFX Hi-Fi USB DAC + SupremeFX Audio 5-zone RGB onboard lighting RAM: 128GB Corsair Dominator Platinum Special Edition DDR4 SSD: 2x Intel 750 Series PCIe NVMe 1.2TB Read/write speeds of up to 2200/1200MB/s 4K random IO 440K/290K IOPS HDD: 4x Seagate Barracuda Pro 10TB Helium PSU: EVGA SuperNova T2 1600W Titanium efficiency rating  Cooling: EKWB water cooling Case: CaseLabs Mercury S8 (modified) Seen something newsworthy?

DPP's Blog Home About Archive Consulting Dell Precision: Works after a Fashion November 7, 2016 Put on your Linux Wading Boots Last week, I took delivery of a Dell Precision 5510 "pre-loaded" with Linux. It did not work so well. The folks at Dell worked to provide support, but at the end of the day, the version of Ubuntu shipped with the Precision was too fragile and the standard Ubuntu installer couldn't create a boot loader. However, the Precision 5510 is very nice hardware and I have a significant need for a laptop with more than 16GB of RAM. I've also using Linux since 1996 and Linux on laptops since 2000. What I needed was a mind-set change. I needed to change my mind-set from "this should work like OS X, Windows, or Ubuntu on my XPS 13" to "it's possible to do... so go do it." Skylake and Kernels The Precision has a Skylake (6th generation) Xeon CPU. The 4.8 Linux kernel has support for Skylake. Previous kernels do not. The key reason for needing support is power management as Skylake has far more granular settings than previous Intel chips. I needed a version of Linux that has a 4.8 kernel. This could be something like Arch or Ubuntu 16.10. I opted for 16.10 because, despite having had success with Arch in the past, I prefer to spend my time coding rather than configuring my Linux system. So... I downloaded Ubuntu 16.10 and did the guided install. That failed the same way the 16.04 LTS install failed: could not install the boot loader. So, I tried again. This time I did a manual disk partition. That worked... although I had to explicitly set the target for GRUB installation. So... yay... I installed Ubuntu 16.10 on the Precision 5510 and it booted. Not only did it boot, but it found all the devices (wireless, etc.) in the machine. Installing software The standard Ubuntu software management tools work. Sleep/wake works. Battery life is reasonable (5 1/2 hours). Sleep is problematic: a 10% battery drain every 8 hours. But this is a common issue with Linux on laptops. While my Dell XPS 13 sleeps like a Mac (a week, no problem), most Linux laptops (including those sold by System76) consume a lot of power during sleep. The trackpad has palm issues, so I had to disable tap-to-click. Yes, I spent 45 minutes trying all the different palm-detection related incantations... but none worked. At the end of the day, my Precision 5510 is now a functional laptop. The Hardware The Precision 5510 hardware is spectacular. The Precision weighs 71oz. My 15" MacBook Pro weighs 70.5oz. They weigh the same. The Precision is less deep and slightly taller than the MBP. But the difference in dimensions is trivial and the Precision fits all the MBP sleeves and such I have laying around. The Precision's screen is higher resolution and sharper than the MBP. It's also slightly larger. The only issue is the built in camera is at the bottom of the screen rather than the top. This could lead to less flattering video calls... plus issues with my hands on the keyboard getting in the way of the camera. The Precision's trackpad is very nice... it feels excellent. It is precise. With the exception of the palm issue, it's as perfect as the Mac's. The materials on the Precision are nicer than the Mac. The Precision's case feels more solid than the MBP. The carbon fiber palm area feels better than the MBP's aluminum palm area. The Precision's case is slightly rounded rather than the sharp edges of the MBP. The Precision's keyboard feels slightly better than the MBP and far better than the "dual butterfly" MacBook's keyboard. Just at the hardware level, Dell meets or exceeds what Apple did the with MBP. It's fast... really, really fast The Precision is the fastest computer I've ever used. It's faster than my 6 core desktop machine. It's faster than the MBP. And it's got 32GB of RAM which is useful when running a cluster of Mesos in VirtualBox on the go. Battery Life My MBP has a 7 hour battery life when I'm doing non-coding stuff. My 13" MBP has a 9 hour battery life. My MacBook has a 4 hour battery life. The Precision seems to have a 5 hour battery life for similar tasks. I have only tested the battery for a day, so I'm relying mostly on the battery indicator which seems to be accurate. While the MBP is better, I'm willing to take the hit to be able to travel and code on large projects. USB-C I've got a gaggle of USB-C dongles that I bought when I got my MacBook. With the exception of the power-related dongles, they "just work" with the Dell. The Precision's USB-C port is not advertised as supporting USB PD, so this is expected. Conclusion Dell should not be advertising this machine as a Linux machine. It's no more a Linux machine than any other Intel-powered laptop. It's not a Linux machine like the XPS 13 Developer Edition. But, I'm willing to be my own Linux admin and do my own Linux support in exchange for rock-solid hardware and a machine that meets my needs for large memory and a fast CPU. So, I'm going to keep this machine and it will become my development laptop. Will I buy Dell next time? That remains to be seen. (c) 2010-2016 David P.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Nov 7, 2016 at 11:06AM Throughout most of 2016, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) seemed to be a laggard in the virtual-reality market. Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) Oculus Rift and HTC's Vive courted high-end PC gamers, Samsung's Gear VR and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Cardboard introduced VR to mobile users, and Sony's (NYSE:SNE) PlayStation VR made PS4 games more immersive. Microsoft, however, merely hinted at Oculus Rift compatibility with its Xbox Scorpio upgrade. Image source: Getty Images. But that all changed in late October at Microsoft's Windows 10 event, which finally revealed the tech giant's VR ambitions. Let's discuss five key things investors should know about the company's upcoming VR headsets. 1. Tethered, with "inside out" sensors Like the Rift and Vive, Microsoft's VR headsets will be tethered to PCs. That means users can't freely move around as they could with a mobile-based device such as the Gear VR, or a standalone one such as Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) Project Alloy. However, Microsoft claims that these new headsets can track a user's head rotation and position without setting up additional sensors around the room. The Rift and Vive, by comparison, both use external sensors to track the headset's position in space. Microsoft claims that its headsets use "inside out" sensors that can track a user's position with internal hardware -- making it much easier for multiple people to use headsets in the same area. 2. A much more affordable VR experience Microsoft won't make these headsets by itself. Instead, it's relying on its longtime hardware partners HP, Lenovo, Dell, Asus, and Acer to deliver the goods. The headsets will start at just $300, which is much cheaper than the $600 Rift and $800 Vive. Microsoft has also stated that its headsets won't require pricey high-end PCs as the Rift and Vive do. Hololens and VR head Alex Kipman recently told Polygon: "We've lowered the specs you need for PC from a $1,500 system to a $500 one." 3. Possible training wheels for the HoloLens During the demo, Microsoft's VR headset was entirely controlled by voice commands and hand gestures. That was quite different from the Rift, Vive, or PSVR -- which all use external controllers. But those controls closely resembled the ones for the HoloLens. Since the HoloLens' development kit costs $3,000, it remains out of the reach of mainstream consumers. But if Microsoft floods the market with $300 VR devices that use the same controls, they could serve as "training wheels" for the HoloLens before it's officially launched. Microsoft's HoloLens. Image source: Microsoft. 4. Locking in developers with a big Windows 10 update To establish a new computing platform, Microsoft needs to win over developers. It intends to do so with the upcoming Windows 10 Creator Update, which will add 3D image capture and editing tools. These tools will enable artists and developers to create 3D objects which can be viewed in Microsoft's VR headsets or HoloLens. To reach the largest number of developers, Microsoft is simplifying the tools so that 12-year-olds can use them. If the platform attracts enough new developers, Microsoft's vision of turning Windows 10 into a "holographic" OS -- as it has repeatedly demonstrated in HoloLens demos -- could become a reality. 5. Is this Microsoft's answer to the PSVR? Microsoft has spent a lot of time strengthening the bonds between Windows 10 and the Xbox One, with a shared app store and game streaming. Therefore, it's logical for Microsoft to tether its new headsets to the Xbox One as well. Doing so would help Microsoft counter the PSVR and offer Xbox One owners a way to play new games with VR features. That also means Facebook's Oculus VR and Microsoft won't really be allies in the VR market. The Oculus Rift runs on Windows PCs, but the company is aggressively growing its own VR ecosystem, Oculus Home, which would ultimately clash with Microsoft's vision for an AR/VR-powered Windows 10. Oculus has also been developing its own standalone device, the Santa Cruz headset, which would naturally become a rival to Microsoft's VR devices. The key takeaway Microsoft's VR ambitions seem well planned and could serve as a natural stepping stone between PCs and HoloLens. They could also finally help Microsoft evolve into a market-leading innovator to counter rivals such as Sony, Facebook, and Google across multiple markets.

While the traction of 10G is scaling in business and enterprise, cost remains a big barrier to home and prosumer networking, but also consumer based implementations. We recently posted a news update with the current 10GBase-T motherboards on the market, and this is the second review of that list: today we are testing ASUS' new high-end LGA2011-3 workstation refresh model, the ASUS X99-E-10G WS. The motherboard uses Intel’s latest 10GBase-T controller, the X550, which runs as a PCIe 3.0 x4 implementation.  Other AnandTech Reviews for Intel’s LGA2011-3 Platform The Intel Core i7-6950X, i7-6900K, i7-6850K and i7-6800K Broadwell-E Review The Intel Core i7-5960X, i7-5930K and i7-5820 Haswell-E Review The Intel Xeon E5 v3 Fourteen-Core Review (E5-2695 v3, E5-2697 v3) The Intel Xeon E5 v3 Twelve-Core Review (E5-2650L v3, E5-2690 v3) The Intel Xeon E5 v3 Ten-Core Review (E5-2650 v3, E5-2687W v3) X99 Series Motherboard Reviews: Prices Correct at time of each review $750: The ASRock X99 WS-E 10G Review [link] $600: The ASUS X99-E-10G WS Review (this review) $600: The ASRock X99 Extreme11 Review [link] $500: The ASUS Rampage V Extreme Review [link] $400: The ASUS X99-Deluxe Review [link] $340: The GIGABYTE X99-Gaming G1 WiFi Review [link] $330: The ASRock X99 OC Formula Review [link] $323: The ASRock X99 WS Review [link] $310: The GIGABYTE X99-UD7 WiFi Review [link] $310: The ASUS X99 Sabertooth Review [link] $300: The GIGABYTE X99-SOC Champion Review [link] $300: The ASRock X99E-ITX Review [link] $300: The MSI X99S MPower Review [link] $275: The ASUS X99-A Review [link] $241: The MSI X99S SLI PLUS Review [link] The State of the 10GBase-T Market Current integration of 10GBase-T onto a motherboard is an expensive process. In order to get full bandwidth, at the bare minimum, either a PCIe 2.0 x4 or PCIe 3.0 x2 connection per port is needed, and it depends on the controller used. This controller would traditionally interface with the CPU, reducing the PCIe lanes available for other large PCIe devices and co-processors, such as GPUs, storage cards or professional compute cards. In the last generation of consumer chipsets, the ability to run them direct from the large PCIe bandwidth on the 100-series chipsets is a future potential play, although technically the 100-series chipset connects to the CPU via a PCIe 3.0 x4 equivalent link which may be a future bottleneck. There are three main commercial controllers currently on offer that are used in both PCIe cards and motherboard integration. First, and what we’ve seen so far, is the Intel X540 family of controllers which require x8 lanes and runs at PCIe 2.0 speeds (i.e. in a PCIe 3.0 environment, it still needs x8 as the controller is only PCIe 2.0). The upgrade to this, the Intel X550 family, makes that leap to PCIe 3.0 and requires an x4 link which makes it easier to integrate into a modern platform but might be a touch more expensive by virtue of it being new. Third is an Aquantia / Tehuti Networks solution, which we’ve seen on 10GBase-T PCIe cards bundled with certain motherboard configurations or by third-parties for sale on their own. The Intel X540/X550 parts are families of controllers, offering single and dual port designs, and to our knowledge are better supported and use less motherboard area (but are more expensive) than the Tehuti solution. All these chips output up to 15W on their own, requiring a motherboard built to disperse the extra heat generated. As a result, any user looking at an integrated 10GBase-T solution has only a few options, and will have to find a way to justify the cost (which is easier in a business perspective). Aside from the 10GBase-T switch cost (cheapest is a 2-port unmanaged switch for $250 from ASUS, an 8-port previous generation Netgear X708 for $700, or a 16-port Netgear for ~$1400), the previous motherboard we reviewed with an integrated X540-T2 controller still runs at $700, over a year after its release. The controller cost is around $100-$200, depending on the motherboard manufacturers deal with Intel, which leads to a direct bill-of-materials (BOM) increase in the base cost. The PCIe cards with single or dual ports can be purchased for around $250-$400, depending on sales, support, and if they are new. (For those looking outside copper, there are also solutions available, but are less likely to be integrated into a home/current SMB setup without prior planning). For anyone looking to migrate a home network to 10GBase-T has to be aware of this outlay, and a number of users (myself included) are waiting diligently until the cost of such an ecosystem comes down. I do wonder exactly what the tipping point would be for a number of enthusiasts to make the jump, especially with a number of networking technologies in the works (such as 2.5G/5G, or 802.11ad wireless routers now coming into the market for consumers offering gigabit line-of-sight connectivity). I have had some companies ask me what that tipping point is, and to be honest I still think it’s the switch – a 4x10G + 4x1G port managed switch for $250 would sell like hot cakes, regardless of the cost of controllers. The ASUS X99-E-10G WS Overview The feature that’s hard to ignore is the 10G ports, and to be honest buying this motherboard relies on needing to use these ports (or trying to be ‘futureproof’ when building a 3-5 year system). Adding in the capability for a motherboard to also support x16/x16/x16/x16 with its main PCIe ports means that extra and expensive hardware is needed for full bandwidth support. This ability comes through PCIe switches, namely a pair of Avago PLX8747 switches. These ~$50ea final cost add-ons convert (mux/demux) sixteen lanes of PCIe 3.0 from the processor into thirty-two (32) lanes that are converted to x16/x16. As the main processors for this motherboard, such as the Intel Core i7-6950X, offer 40 lanes of PCIe, taking 32 away leaves eight lanes. This final eight lanes is split into four for the 10G controller and four for the U.2/M.2 PCIe 3.0 x4 slot at the bottom of the board. ASUS intends to make this motherboard the single port of call for all your PCIe needs.   One of the benefits of the PCIe configuration is that the board can support a full complement of GPUs for 4-way SLI or 4-way Crossfire (or even more for compute tasks, depending on GPU size or riser cables). One of the main criticisms of using PCIe switches is that there is a small amount of overhead which could reduce peak performance, but in gaming as we’ve tested before, it is sub 1%. In fact, this is the only way to support 4-way x16, and allows for faster GPU-to-GPU communication (for adjacent GPUs), which can be required for compute tasks. As this is a premium motherboard, ASUS didn’t skip on the ‘regular’ features either. Starting their OC socket for premium LGA2011-3 platforms, the power delivery is enforced using ASUS’ high-end chokes as well as an extended heatsink arrangement for the high powered ICs present. The X99-E-10G WS will support 128GB of DDR4-2133, including up to ECC registered memory with the appropriate Xeon E5 v4 processor, and will have profiles up to DDR4-3333 for non-ECC gaming memory. Aside from the 10 SATA ports, U.2 and M.2, ASUS’ WS line is designed to be verified with a longer list of workstation-like hardware, such as RAID cards and FPGAs, to ensure compatibility. Thus given seven 16-way RAID cards, the motherboard makes an interesting storage proposition. Or add in more 10G ports. Due to the 10G ports, ASUS does not include any 1G ports, however the 10G ports do work at 1G speeds. For the audio, ASUS has their upgraded Realtek ALC1150 solution with filter caps, PCB separation and additional audio software. On the rear panel, ASUS has removed any USB 2.0 ports and left a pair of USB 3.1 (one A, one C) and a set of four USB 3.0 ports. The PCIe slots also get an upgrade here, with the four main GPU slots featuring semi-transparent latches that the user can light up via a DIP switch to indicate which slots are needed to maximize 2-way, 3-way or 4-way GPU use. Each of the seven slots also has extra metallic reinforcement embedded into the slot itself, designed to maintain rigidity when heavy PCIe devices are used or PCIe devices are installed during bumpy transit. Performance wise it is sufficient to say that the idle power of this WS board is higher than that of standard X99 motherboards however for consumer CPUs Multi-Core Turbo is enabled by default, giving a little extra speed (at the expense of a bit of power). Metrics such as DPC Latency and Audio Quality are both in the better halves of the tables for the tests, but with most WS boards with extra features there is a little more POST time than normal. We tested the board up to 3-way SLI (I didn’t have a fourth GTX 980, sorry), seeing game-dependent enhancements at 4K.

Also switches from Mikrotik ( CRS226-24G-2S+RM ) and Ubiquiti ( EdgeSwitch ES‑16‑XG ). Reply dsumanik - Monday, November 07, 2016 - link Fair enough, but one thing this article is NOT missing is better multi GPU testing, thank you Ian. In this day and age It is important to test every aspect of the board, not take the mfg's word for it or you wind up being a part of thier beta test. Then when the bugs occur and sales slow, the bios team gets allocated to the more popular boards And you wait in limbo -sometimes permanently- for fixes Reply Gadgety - Monday, November 07, 2016 - link I agree. Reply prisonerX - Monday, November 07, 2016 - link The XeonD has 10G MACs, which are not the particularly power hungry part of 10G ethernet, it's the PHY block, and in particular 10GBase-T which is the power hog. XeonD doesn't implement those. Reply BillR - Tuesday, November 08, 2016 - link Correct, the PHY is where the bulk of the power is used. I would expect the performance between the XeonD and the X550 to be similar since they use the same basic Ethernet MAC block logic. I would be a bit leery of using another LAN solution though, the Intel solution has been pretty rock solid. A problem I rarely have to think about is the best problem of all. Reply ltcommanderdata - Monday, November 07, 2016 - link You mentioned PCIe switches add a little bit of overhead which isn't a problem for graphics cards, but is the small added latency likely to be a concern for more sensitive applications like audio cards? Or is it better to use PCIe slots that are not on the PCIe switch for those? Also is there any sense yet on a time-to-market schedule for 2.5G/5G ethernet controllers and when motherboards and routers will start showing up with them? Reply TheinsanegamerN - Monday, November 07, 2016 - link My guess is never. Outside of a very specific niche, nobody needs more then 1Gbps. Reply JoeyJoJo123 - Monday, November 07, 2016 - link >My guess is never, nobody needs HD. The human eye can't see past 640x480 interlaced.

Do these leaked shots show a Dell Windows 10 phone or Surface Phone? by Joe Roberts 07 November 2016 0 shares Read Comments Many smartphone fans have been hoping to see a phone that runs a full version of Windows 10 for some time now, and it seems we've just got a look at a new handset that does just that – though whether it will ever launch remains unclear. Evan Blass, aka @evleaks, shared the following images, which some have said could be Microsoft's long-rumoured Surface Phone, while other reports claim it's a Dell device that runs full Windows 10. Related: Surface Phone – Everything we know There's no way to know if the images shared by Blass are the Surface Phone, but Thurrott claims it is a Dell-made device that uses Intel processors to run a full version of Windows 10, citing 'sources familiar with the phone". However, the report also states that Intel scrapped development on the silicon that would have been used to power the handset, so it seems we're unlikely to see this phone in the flesh any time soon. That said, Blass has 'confirmed' to The Verge's Tom Warren that the phone in question is "much more than a concept", and shared some shots of the device being used in the real world. Just what we're looking at here, and whether it will be released remains unclear, for now then, but it whatever the case, we're sure it won't be long until a full Windows 10 phone arrives in some form. While the images from Blass might not show the Surface Phone, the device is yet to be officially identified, so watch this space for more in the near future. WATCH: Surface Studio first look Let us know what you think of the latest Surface Phone developments in the comments. 0 shares Read Comments Rob Bush November 7, 2016, 6:21 pm Can't be a Surface phone because it has hard buttons for back, home and search. The current line of Lumia 950 phones has soft buttons that hide when you watch a video clip or look at pictures and they rotate when you turn to landscape mode. There is no way Microsoft would back track on this because it provides valuable screen real estate when they are hidden. The future of phones is no more hard buttons on the face of the phone (whether you like this or not, it's a reality.)

This should come as no surprise to those who’ve long perceived the Mac platform as inward-looking, limited in compatibility, and generally worse value for money than comparable Windows alternatives. Pros are smart with their tools and their money, after all. But the change with Apple’s 2016 generation of MacBook Pros is that those downsides have been amped up — more expensive and less compatible than ever before — to an extreme that exposes the fallacy of the continued use of the Pro moniker. These are Apple’s premium laptops, its deluxe devices, but not in any meaningful way computers tailored for the pros. A MacBook Pro is now simply what you buy if you’re in the Apple ecosystem and have a higher budget and expectations than the MacBook can fulfill. Those complaining about Apple's current Mac lineup are not haters, they're lovers. They've spent 10+ years and 5+ figures on Macs. — Jeff J. (@lapcatsoftware) October 29, 2016 The backlash from among pro Mac users that’s arisen in the wake of this new product launch is unprecedented, drowning out even the widespread grumbling about the loss of the headphone jack from the iPhone 7 just a month prior. Just take a look at this studious blog post from Michael Tsai, which gathers together the broad negative consensus from among Apple's most passionate followers. The Mac community finds the specs underwhelming, even on the 15-inch model, which uses power-sipping AMD Radeon graphics instead of the world-conquering Nvidia Pascal chips. Emotions are running so low that people are even speculating about whether Apple should do with the Mac what IBM did when it sold off the ThinkPad line to Lenovo. This is partially because Apple hasn’t had a class-leading professional Mac computer for years — the Mac Pro is 1,054 days old now — and the new laptops have given an outlet and reason for expectant fans to vent. Many people were clinging on to their aging MacBook Pros in the vain hope of seeing a major spec and performance upgrade that simply didn’t materialize, and that's been frustrating. Here's how the 15" #MacBookPro 2016 component specs compare to the 2012 model: CPU: +8.9% to +13% MEM: +33% GPU: +53% to +184% /cc @mjtsai pic.twitter.com/uucjBzXe6C— Felix Schwarz (@felix_schwarz) October 28, 2016 The updated MacBooks from Apple have newer chips, but not that much newer, with Apple using yesteryear’s Intel Skylake CPUs and not this year’s Kaby Lake. They have faster storage, which is an indisputable benefit, but they also max out at 16GB of RAM. For consumer or casual use, that’s perfectly adequate, but "for a developer work machine, 16GB is the uncomfortable minimum requirement," as web developer Baldur Bjarnason points out. Apple seems surprised by the predictable backlash at betraying the trust of its most loyal customers Here’s the thing: if these new MacBooks simply didn’t carry the Pro label, we’d all have a lot less to complain about. It’s perfectly okay for a company to craft expensive, niche devices that will only match the particular needs of a select group of people. But over the course of the past decade or two, the entire tech industry has moved away from labeling things as exclusive or luxurious, opting for more inclusive language. If you can’t afford the premium model, that implies you’re not wealthy enough; but if you can’t afford the pro version, maybe you’re just not that into it. A subtle, but important distinction. And so it is, that we’re now living in a world populated by the PS4 Pro, DJI Mavic Pro, Surface Pro, iPad Pro, Beats Pro, Logitech Pro Gaming Mouse, and many others. Those of us old enough to remember ATI, the Canadian graphics card company that was taken over by AMD, will remember it pioneered many of these tags with such historic GPUs as the Radeon 9500 Pro, 9800 SE, X800 XT, and so on. They’re all meaningless as far as the company is concerned, but it just so happens that the "Pro" appendage is more meaningful to users than slapping on a "Plus" or "XL." With the obvious exception of leisure-time devices like the PlayStation console, a "pro" piece of consumer electronics is generally interpreted as a signal to actual professionals that this machine is for them. I'm out of apologia juice for defending Apple going with 4 USB-C ports on the new MacBook over a useful mix and keeping the MagSafe. — DHH (@dhh) October 28, 2016 Apple’s folly is in not recognizing just how passionate and committed its professional audience is. But the company should already know that all the iOS app developers that generate its unparalleled third-party software ecosystem are doing their work on Macs. It should be aware of their RAM requirements and the improvements they most want to see. "Pro" used to mean something when it came at the end of MacBook model names Beyond developers, there are the photographers and video producers that have made Mac computers the central hub of their home and work studios for many years, thanks to Apple’s early prioritization of high-quality displays and intuitive software. Leaving them without an SD card slot or an included adapter runs entirely counter to Apple’s fundamental principles of having a coherent ecosystem and a more user-friendly approach than the (previously) cold and aloof Windows PC manufacturers. Apple used to be a friend to creative professionals, and now that it’s acting against their wishes and interests, it seems surprised at their impassioned negative response. The backlash to the new MacBook Pro is so bad that Apple has slashed its accessory prices and LG's monitors to appease. Seems unprecedented — Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) November 7, 2016 MacBook Pros were once professional computers that could also appeal to an aspiring consumer audience. They were pricey for a general-purpose laptop, but justifiable as a luxury purchase or as a device that pays for itself by making its user more efficient and productive. But today MacBook Pros are very definitely consumer devices that only gesture toward a professional audience without truly endeavoring to appease it. The new Touch Bar is not a pro feature. It’s cool, it works really well, and it has tons of potential for the future, but it clashes with professional workflows, many of which involve external monitors and keyboards. Apple showed how DJs might use it, but those same people would probably prefer to have dongle-free USB ports for the rest of their gear and a MagSafe charging adapter in the event of some inebriated clubber tripping over their cables. None of Apple's additions improve professional workflows yet, and its subtractions will lead to plenty of headaches The ultra-flat keyboard with 0.55mm key travel is also not professionally minded. Its purpose is overall thinness, but I know of no app developers, globetrotting businesspeople, or digital artists that had "more thinness" anywhere near the top of their priority list of MacBook Pro improvements. Professional writers might have asked for more tactile response, not less, and Apple's keyboard alterations seem to primarily serve to optimize and harmonize its design rather than enhance any functionality. Apple’s 2016 MacBook Pros carry on the Pro moniker dishonestly. At least we should all hope that's the case — because if Apple actually believes that these new laptops are suitable and sufficient for intensive professional needs, then the company's long and happy relationship with creatives may be heading toward a calamitous breakup.

Microsoft to Launch Multi-Million Euro Windows 10 Ad Campaign in Europe GO Microsoft Germany to launch online and offline Windows ads Nov 7, 2016 12:52 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Microsoft is preparing a new Windows 10 advertising push in Europe, with the company investing millions of Euros in this new effort as it plans to target users in both the online and offline worlds. According to a report from German website WindowsUnited, the campaign was created together with Intel, and it is scheduled to go live on November 7 and run through December 17. It will include ads that will be aired on German TV channels, but also online and on social media websites. Microsoft is focusing all of its efforts in this new campaign on two different advertisements that are specifically aimed at businesses, as they present two entrepreneurs that use Windows 10 devices for a variety of tasks. The HP Specter x360 and the Surface Pro 4 are both highlighted in these ads, which you can watch in full at the end of the article. Windows 10 running on 1 in 3 PCs in Europe According to third-party data provided by StatCounter, Windows 10 is running on 29.91 percent of computers on the Old Continent, very close to Windows 7, which leads the charts with 35.09 percent. But while Windows 10 is doing pretty well in the consumer market, not the same thing can be said about enterprise, where the operating system is still in piloting stage, and some large companies are only now evaluating the upgrade. Microsoft is clearly trying to show Europeans the advantages of using Windows 10 for their businesses, putting the emphasis not only on the operating system but also on the hardware and devices that make it possible to use all the features. It remains to be seen if the new ad campaign will be successful or not, but readers who live in Europe should get ready for a new advertising push from Microsoft that should bring Windows 10 anywhere they look, both online and offline.

Zotac crams AMD's Radeon RX 480 into a tiny gaming mini-PC that's built for VR Zotac's new ERX480 is the first mini PC to come with the Polaris-based Radeon RX 480 GPU. Ian Paul (PC World (US online)) on 05 November, 2016 02:02 0 - - - - print email Zotac's newest VR-capable mini PC kit should fulfill the dreams of AMD fans everywhere. In what appears to be a first, the new Magnus ERX480 comes packing an AMD Radeon RX 480 Polaris-based GPU. Zotac's selling the new mini PC in three models: barebones, Plus, and Windows 10. The barebones version is what you’d expect in a kit like this. It comes with a 2.2GHz Intel “Skylake” Core i5-6400T CPU and the aforementioned Radeon RX 480, but lacks RAM, storage, and an operating system. The Magnus ERX480 packs two memory slots that can take up to 32GB of DDR4 RAM in 1866 or 2133MHz flavors. For storage, the ERX480 provides a 2.5-inch SATA 3.0 bay and an M.2 SATA SSD slot. The Plus version, meanwhile, might be a good choice for Linux fans who don’t want the hassle of inserting their own storage and RAM. It includes 8GB of DDR4 RAM, a 1TB 2.5-inch hard drive, and a 120GB M.2 SSD. The Windows 10 version is simply the Plus version with Windows 10 Home 64-bit preinstalled. The rear port lineup of the ERX480. All three versions of the ERX480 come packing a veritable smorgasbord of USB ports, with two USB 2.0 ports, two USB 3.0 ports, and singular USB 3.1 Type-A and USB 3.1 Type-C connections. The USB 3.1 ports are both gen. 2. The Magnus ERX480 can power four displays at once and comes with two HDMI 2.0 and two DisplayPort 1.3 ports. Zotac says the mini PC can do 4K at 60Hz. Beyond those highlights the ERX480 offers the usual niceties, including 802.11ac/b/g/n Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.2, and an SD/SDHC/SDXC card reader. The ERX480 measures 8.27 inches by 8 inches and has depth of 2.45 inches. Zotac did not announce pricing or a specific release date for the ERX480. Why this matters: Until now, mini-PC kits with built-in GPUs mostly stuck with Nvidia's GeForce parts, owing to poor power efficiency on the AMD side. That changed with AMD's new Polaris-based Radeon GPUs, which are far more power efficient than their predecessors. Power efficiency in a small rig like the Magnus ERX480 is paramount since more power equals more heat, and more heat makes cooling—which is already handicapped by the smaller space—that much harder to deal with.

Simon Harriott STYLISTIC Q702 My first impression after unboxing the Q702 is that it is a nice looking unit. Styling is somewhat minimalist but very effective. The tablet part, once detached, has a nice weight, and no buttons or switches are located in awkward or intrusive positions.

Cerber had conducted more than 160 campaigns when examined in July targeting 150,0000 users and raking in a cracking US$195,000 in profits in that month alone. Of that figure, Cerber's developer pocketed some US$78,000. It is estimated the malware earns authors and affiliates some US$1 million to US$2.5 million a year. Those figures surpass 2015 ransomware profits said to net authors a conservative US$84,000 a month for slinging ransomware at a cost of US$6000. That's a whopping 1425 per cent profit margin. Security strategist Matthew Rosenquist says chasing businesses is the "next evolution" of ransomware. "[Cerber] now attempts to stop database processes running on the target system so it can encrypt the data," Rosenquist says. "This is a significant shift in focus from consumers to businesses, which typically run databases containing important operational data. "When database files are open and in use by software, they cannot easily be encrypted." It may not be the first to target businesses. The Register has been told of private ransomware variants sent to a limited number of highly-target organisations that encrypt very valuable databases and documents, demanding ransoms topping tens of thousands of dollars for the supply of decryption keys. Rosenquist warns administrators to be on alert for databases abruptly stopping which could signal Cerber is starting its encryption run. It appears there is no method to decrypt Ceber-encrypted files since an update to the malware rendered CheckPoint's decoding tool ineffective. Security engineers are continually working to find a dwindling pool of implementation and side-channel vulnerabilities to help decrypt files encrypted with high quality ransomware. The problem has this year been formalised into the NoMoreRansom alliance which unifies a formerly scattered and silo-ed, but furious effort by malware researchers to lay ruin to scores of ransomware variants, leaving a scant few including the latest Ceber, Cryptxxx, and Cryptowall unbroken. Victims who cannot decrypt their ransomware infections should also try Trend Micro's continually updated decryption tool. ® Sponsored: The state of mobile security maturity Tips and corrections 9 Comments More from The Register Action Fraud warns of fraudulent anti-fraud warnings posing as Action Fraud Phishing emails promise free money 16 Comments WikiLeaks uploads 300+ pieces of malware among email dumps Freedom.

Are These Leaked Pics the New Surface Phone? Categories Microsoft Mobile PhonesAuthor by Chris Black November 5, 2016 2,035 0 Microsoft’s Surface Phone is already a myth, a legend in its own time, a Loch Ness Monster, something you can only whisper it, as it’s rumored for quite a while now but it fails to materialize. Well, at least until today. According to the famous leakster @evleaks, these renders/pictures or whatever you want to call them are showcasing the upcoming Surface Phone in all its splendor and then some. Truth be told, the leakster was ambiguous with regard to where he got the pics and what do they really represent, as they were first announced as concepts, as per the initial tweets. So, these leaked renders must be taken with a big grain of Himalayan salt, as @evleaks was vague and unclear. But in the same time, this guy chose to pour some extra gasoline over the napalm fire, saying that the Surface Phone will be powered by a laptop class Intel CPU, i.e. this smartphone will blow our collective minds. You know us, WP 10 aficionados. During the Twitter session, some geek replied that this was a nice concept, but nothing more than a pipe dream. And that comment made @evleaks to go berserk and to tweet some additional photos, saying it’s the same device but during a “real life”photo shoot and the whole palaver. So, judging from these pieces of intel, it sounds very plausible that the Surface Phone is really in the works, alive and kicking and waiting to hit the world in the teeth (just wait to see the price-tag). At least that’s my analysis, after considering @evleaks’s track record, which is pretty awesome to say the least. Not to mention that the man himself said at the end of the convo that this is more than a feeling, strike that, much more than a concept, stay tuned. So, there’s more than meets the eye and we’ll definitely find out what’s up with that in the days/weeks to come.

View Latest Posts >>> Russian combat experience in Syria is a major force multiplier By Jim W. Dean, Managing Editor on November 6, 2016 … from  South Front A technical edge in small ground-to-air missiles can make choppers a turkey shoot [ Editor’s Note: Although this South Front article is focused on improving their helicopter performance in terms of speed and pilot training, their whole command and control structure is getting a good vetting to expose the weaknesses that only real combat conditions can. Helicopter deployment itself is a complex decision-making process, as highly accurate Intel is needed for determining when NOT to send in the choppers, when the enemy is well-armed with ground to air missiles. Moscow has been quiet about what kind of electronic warfare capacity their current machines have, if any. And the expected loss rate of helicopters in combat makes putting one’s most advanced anti-missile countermeasures on them an almost guaranteed gift to one’s opponents when the first one is shot down. The US-NATO move on Russia when it was no military threat whatsoever, having let its military decline so as to build its peacetime infrastructure more quickly, caused Moscow to change priorities.  Moscow discovered major problems just from the brief Georgian conflict, which triggered a long overdue modernization program, but a slow one. Now the plan is not only being speeded up, but advanced even further based on the combat experience Russia would have never gained without the US jihad against Syria. One could make a case that someone actually wanted Russia to go in and become a stronger military to justify it being used as a bogeyman threat by the West. Color me suspicious… Jim W. Dean ] ___________ – First published  …  October 28th,  2016 – An experience of the usage of Russian military helicopters in Syria has allowed to find and work out to the last detail new tactical techniques to overcome air defense systems, Chief of combat training of the army aviation of the Russian Aerospace Forces, Major-General Oleg Chesnokov, said. “The specifics of army aviation operations in any local conflict, including the current conflict in Syria, are analyzed carefully to expose the weaknesses and strengths in the training of pilots and in the ways of operating technologies depending on the geography and details of the situation,” the TASS news agency quoted the words of Chesnokov. “New practical methods in overpowering of enemy air defenses and in delivering fire have been found.” He also noted that recommendations for pilots are developed on the basis on this analysis in a center for pilots training in Torzhok. Then these recommendations are sent to troops and “taken into account in a further scheduled combat training,” the RIA Novosti news agency reported. Chesnokov also added that the latest modification of the Mi-28NE Night Hunter combat helicopters would start to be supplied to Russian troops since 2017. “Currently, prototypes of the Mi-28UB combat helicopter with a dual control system have passed official tests with positive results,” Chesnokov said. He explained that initially, the Mi-28UBs will be sent to the 344th Army Aviation Centre of aircrews combat training and transition, and then combatant air units of the Russian Aerospace Forces will receive them. “An experience of usage of the Mi-28N helicopters showed the need of development of helicopters of this type with a dual control system, now pilots and instructors of the Torzhok’s center have already passed retraining for this modification,” the Major-General added. Chesnokov also announced that the Russian Helicopters company created a ‘flight-research tool’ – a prototype of a prospective high-speed helicopter. The central part in the construction of the flight-research tool of a high-speed helicopter is a main rotor blade. New design solutions for its creation allow to increase the maximum speed of the Mi-28 helicopter by 13%, the maximum speed of the Mi-35 – by 30%. Currently, flight tests are being conducted, and an intermediate result has already been achieved – “the speed of a horizontal flight reached 360 km/h in combination with a low level of vibration and structural loads on the flight-research tool,” Chesnokov pointed out. “The speed of a high-speed helicopter will be increased by 1.5 times compared with known models of attack helicopters, up to 400-500 km/h,” he added. Last week, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said that the operation in Syria has identified a number of design and production shortcomings of Russian military equipment. In the middle of July, Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, General Valery Gerasimov, ordered to eliminate the shortcomings of Russian military equipment and weapons that have been identified during the Syrian operation, until the end of the year. On April 14, during a question and answer session that was televised live, Russian President Vladimir Putin acknowledged that many shortcomings of Russian military hardware have been revealed during the operation of the Russian Aerospace Forces in Syria, however, in general, Russian military equipment has approved itself excellent, and for this reason, foreign demand on Russian weapons has sharply increased. On May 11, Press Secretary for the Russian President, Dmitry Peskov, said that the main problem, revealed in the Russian Armed Forces during the operation in Syria, was operation of military equipment. He also stressed that this experience was analyzed for further improvement of military hardware. On May 12, Deputy CEO on production and innovation of the Russian Helicopters company, Andrey Shibitov, announced that the holding negotiated with the Russian Defense Ministry on program to modernize combat helicopters, based on the experience of their operation in Syria. ____________ Related Posts: Russia Defense Report: Nukes, Bugs, and Gas in Hybrid Wars Russia (and VT) ‘prevented’ potential NATO launch of 624 cruise missiles in Syria Supporters of Militants in Syria Are at Odds New World Order Doctrine Continues to Crumble Morally and Intellectually Confidential NATO Report Praises Russia’s Superiority in Syria The views expressed herein are the views of the author exclusively and not necessarily the views of VT, VT authors, affiliates, advertisers, sponsors, partners, technicians, or the Veterans Today Network and its assigns.

Did the MI28 models use chainguns before the apache? Or was it the other way around? The placement of the sensor pods is also almost identical. I suppose that the best design is the best design no matter which army is using it. It is getting very hard to tell the fast movers apart anymore as their configurations are almost identical (except for the colors of the stars).

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 7 November 2016 Huawei MateBook: A New chapter by rouwen lin Easy on the eye: The Huawei MateBook boasts a slim and elegant design, with a faux leather case that can be folded into a two-angle stand. -- Huawei Huawei’s first 2-in-1 device looks and feels great, and comes with cool optional accessories. IF FIRST impressions count, then the Huawei MateBook is a winner. This is the company’s first foray into the 2-in-1 segment, an attempt to marry the convenience of a ­tablet with the performance of a laptop, and the result is a sleek and slim Windows 10 device powered by a sixth generation Intel Core chip. The impression I took away with me of the MateBook’s good looks at its launch in Spain earlier this year managed to hold up to closer ­scrutiny – and then some. With its fanless design, smooth metal body and rounded edges, this is one attractive device that will certainly turn heads if the world of tech is a runway show.   The MateBook's display resolution makes for sharp images. The MateBook is a slender 6.9mm thick and tips the scales at a mere 640g – it’s similar in thickness to most smartphones and the same as the iPad Pro. It’s even slightly lighter than the latter, although the MateBook’s screen is slightly ­smaller at 12in. The display is excellent and ideal for watching movies; the 2,160 x 1,440-pixel resolution makes for sharp images, and colours are bright and crisp. My review unit (Core m5 chip and 8GB RAM), has a gorgeous gold finish (most others would call it “champagne”, which is more apt) with a brown faux leather case that feels as nice to the touch as it is easy on the eyes. Laws of attraction Magnets are a recurring theme in the MateBook, keeping the design fuss-free and elegant. The keyboard attaches to the tablet via a magnetic port; the keyboard case wraps around the tablet and is secured in place with a magnet; the MatePen holder latches on to the case with a magnet; the MateDock sits snug in its wrap-around cover with yet another magnet. The case folds to form a stand that the tablet can rest on in either one of two angles, which is made possible, again, by magnets. The verdict? The kickstand works well when using the MateBook on a flat surface, like on a desk, but unfortunately it is a bit of a precarious undertaking to type with it on your lap or while ­lounging on the sofa. It falls flat more easily than I would like it to, and although it really doesn’t come unhinged that easily, with the right (or in this case, wrong) jostle, it ­certainly wobbles like it wishes to do so. The MateDock comes with two USB ports and an Ethernet jack on one side, and HDMI and VGA ports on the other.   Having said that, it is easy to switch back and forth between either desktop or tablet modes, and the spill-resistant keyboard is decently proportioned with ­adequate key travel to make typing a breeze. It has backlighting, with four ­levels of brightness and an ­ambient sensor, so it turns on when there is insufficient light. Sitting on the dock Huawei’s built-in fingerprint scanner, located between the ­volume controls on the tablet’s right edge, works like a charm for speedy unlocking and logging in. It is my first time using this feature and I am sold. Below the volume controls sits MateBook’s only data connection – a USB-C port that is used for both power or connecting to external devices. Unless you are a minimalist, this is where the MateDock (RM399) will come in handy with its multifunctional connections. It has two USB ports and an Ethernet jack on one side, and HDMI and VGA ports on the other. If the MateBook is being charged while in use, however, this means only one other USB port is free as the MateDock is plugged into the sole port on the ­tablet. The kickstand is good when using the MateBook on a flat surface. Plus, I would have liked a keyboard volume control, which it lacks. The MateBook is marketed as a 2-in-1 that can bring you through a whole day’s work with a single charge, but in practice this turns out being possible only if your work day ends shortly after lunch break. Or if you don’t actually do anything at work. With moderate usage, running it for five hours on battery is a safe bet. But I wouldn’t risk relying on the MateBook for any longer than that without a backup plan. This is quite a setback, as there are other options out there that beats the MateBook in this aspect. Mighty pen The MateBook comes with the option of a stylus called the MatePen (RM369) for drawing and making notes. Huawei is rather proud of this, and no wonder; it is responsive and precise. Don’t worry about accidentally touching the screen with your hand when using the MatePen – the MateBook’s palm rejection is spot on and I have never had my hand detected as an on-screen touch. At a touch of a button on the MatePen, you can flip through slides or scroll up and down pages, and the laser pointer for presentations or for playing with your cat is a nice touch. If you are on the go with your MateDock, there is a pen loop for the MatePen in the MateDock for storage, which does feel more secure than the holder on the case. A single charge of the MatePen can apparently provide you with 100 hours of usage time. Mine is still going strong on its first charge two weeks ago. But then again, I do not have a cat to torment. The MateBook (grey or gold, with either a brown or black case) starts at RM3,999, inclusive of ­keyboard. The MatePen and MateDock is available at vmall.my. Pros: Light, slim and looks good; has a fantastic display; handy optional accessories. Cons: Battery life could be better; kickstand works well only on flat surfaces.  MateBook (Huawei) OPERATING SYSTEM: Windows 10 Home PROCESSOR: 6th Generation Intel Core m MEMORY: 4GB/8GB RAM DISPLAY: 12in (2,160 x 1,440 pixels) STORAGE: 128GB/256GB/512GB SSD CONNECTIVITY: WiFi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac MIMO, Bluetooth 4.1 PORTS/SLOTS: USB 3.0 Type-C CAMERA: 5 megapixels OTHER FEATURES: Ambient light sensor, fingerprint reader, accelerometer, gyroscope DIMENSIONS: 278.8 x 194.1 x 6.9mm WEIGHT: 640g PRICE: RM3,999 (Core m3/4GB RAM/128GB); RM5,399 (Core m5/8GB RAM/256GB); RM6,699 (Core m7/8GB RAM/512GB) ACCESSORIES: MatePen (RM369), MateDock (RM399) RATING: Four stars Review unit courtesy of Huawei Technologies Malaysia, 1800-22-0086.   Tags / Keywords: huawei , matebook Related Stories Huawei Mate 9: To the nines Huawei launches the Mate 9 Honor 8: Top marks Huawei stays one step ahead with diverse product range How to use the P9 to get that Leica look You May Be Interested Closure of 106 bank branches due to rationalisation plans, says Deputy Finance Minister Weak ringgit to impact 5 sectors Best smartphones for the holidays Alibaba's founder to support 'mini Jack Ma' until university graduation Private-public partnerships in a connected world Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Hunting big game at sea Tourists now prefer lodgings with Airbnb flavour, hoteliers told MRT fare starts at RM1 advertisement Latest News Photo Kit: Taking better photos of your pets (and kids) Make perfect copies of old photos with PhotoScan US trade panel eyes Qualcomm patent complaint against Chinese firms Google commits to post-Brexit UK with major London investment GE acquires two artificial intelligence startups Most Viewed in Tech GE acquires two artificial intelligence startups Best smartphones for the holidays Singapore to launch blockchain project for interbank payments Photo Kit: Taking better photos of your pets (and kids) Make perfect copies of old photos with PhotoScan Google commits to post-Brexit UK with major London investment Warning!

The Tokyo region doubles its Asian presence to two regions and six zones, and Google’s ambitious expansion plans include new Asia-Pacific regions slated for Mumbai, Singapore, and Sydney in the next year, and additional new regions in the U.S., Finland, Germany, UK, and Brazil. Google now offers six regions and 18 availability zones, and is scheduled to reach 14 regions and around 40 zones by the end of next year. AWS and Azure are both offered from more regions, and are also planning to launch new points of presence, but the new regions will reduce the difference. READ MORE: Report: AWS Has Twice the Market Share of Microsoft, Google and IBM Combined “Low latency and high performance are key considerations when choosing a region to deploy resources,” wrote Google Cloud Platform product managers Varun Sakalkar and Dave Stiver in a blog post. “By opening a dedicated cloud region in Tokyo, we’re bringing Google’s compute, storage and networking services directly to Japanese businesses. Based on our testing, customers in cities like Tokyo, Osaka, Sapporo and Nagoya experience 50-85 percent lower latency on average when served from the Tokyo region compared to Taiwan.” Google Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, Cloud Persistent Disk, App Engine standard environment, and Container Engine are now available from the Tokyo region, as well as all core networking and security services and some database and analytics services. Google is running Intel Broadwell processors in the region, and has partnered with several companies in Japan to help onboard customers. Google upgraded GCP’s database services for enterprise customers in August. Google has also recently invested in a pair of submarine cables, FASTER and PLCN, as it attempts to scale its network to compete with Amazon and Microsoft.

Texas, Nov. 8, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Mouser Electronics Inc., a leading global distributor of electronic components, today announced the winner for the innovative International Space Station (I.S.S.) Design Challenge, a first-of-its-kind global contest that was open to the public, calling for engineers and makers of all levels to create a useful object for astronauts that could be printed aboard the I.S.S. The winner, Andy Filo, created a device that launches femto satellites, tiny satellites about the size of a postage stamp. This innovative design is discussed in the video released today, featuring celebrity engineer Grant Imahara as they visit Made In Space — pioneers in additive manufacturing technology for use in the space environment — who are 3D-printing the design. Mouser Electronics Announces Winner of International Space Station Design Challenge The I.S.S. Design Challenge is one of several innovative series in Mouser's award-winning Empowering Innovation Together™ program, which features the newly developed Innovation Lab for new projects ranging from bringing super hero technology to life to 3D-printing a semi-autonomous car with drone technology. "We received hundreds of really interesting and creative entries for this challenge. It was truly inspiring and fun, but it was a really tough competition to judge," said Imahara. "Mouser's dedication to the engineering and maker communities was at the heart of this challenge," said Glenn Smith, President and CEO of Mouser Electronics. "The contestants' imaginations really took flight, and it was no easy task for our judges to choose a winner. We're ecstatic with the level of innovation the contestants displayed." Mouser's valued suppliers Amphenol and Intel® are co-sponsors of the I.S.S. Design Challenge. Mouser also partnered with the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and Made In Space, along with Hackster and MacroFab. To learn more about the winning design in the I.S.S.

So what should the tech policy crowd look for in the days and weeks ahead, as a Clinton or Trump administration prepares to take office? Nancy developed this handy primer, based off how things played out in the immediate aftermath of President Barack Obama’s win in 2008: Story Continued Below — The day after the '08 election, the Obama-Biden transition launched Change.gov, pitching it as a source of news and announcements about the incoming Obama administration. The website struggled to stay up on its first day, but Change.gov became a focal point for anyone trying to understand the administration-in-waiting; every edit to its pages was scrutinized for meaning. If history holds, look for the new president-elect’s transition website to go live at some point Wednesday. We’re taking bets on what the domain name will be. StrongerTogether.gov? MakeAmericaGreatAgain.gov? — Seven days later, President-elect Obama began announcing his agency review teams — groups of experts charged with laying out the staffing, budgetary and policy groundwork necessitated by taking over more than 80 federal agencies and offices, including the FCC and FTC. Many of those named to the squads went on to key administration roles: The head of the Obama-Biden “Science, Tech, Space and Arts Team,” for example, was Tom Wheeler, who later became FCC chairman. If the president-elect keeps to a similar pace, we’ll see agency teams being made public around Nov. 18. — And a week after that, Obama named the policy working groups responsible for converting his campaign-trail promises into workable plans for his presidency. The co-chairmen of his Technology, Innovation & Government reform group — a.k.a. TIGR — included future FCC chairman Julius Genachowski, who was Wheeler’s predecessor in that role. Among the ranks of the group’s 30-plus members were future U.S. CTO Aneesh Chopra and future U.S. CIO Vivek Kundra. If the previous pattern holds, the existence of those teams and the names of the people serving on them would be released around Nov. 23. GOOD TUESDAY MORNING!

SENATE RACES WE’RE TRACKING — Along with the House races highlighted in MT on Monday, we’re monitoring a handful of Senate matchups that could have an outsized influence on tech policy in the next Congress: — Burr vs. Ross in North Carolina: Republican Sen. Richard Burr is facing off against Democratic challenger Deborah Ross in a down-to-the-wire race. Burr, chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence, is a staunch defender of government surveillance. He has drafted legislation with Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) that would force tech companies to decrypt customer data when served with a warrant. — Johnson vs. Feingold in Wisconsin: Former Sen. Russ Feingold, a Democrat, is vying to take back his old seat from GOP Sen. Ron Johnson, who heads the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. Feingold is known as a consumer privacy advocate; he was the sole lawmaker to vote against the USA Patriot Act back in 2001. — Harris vs. Sanchez in California: California Attorney General Kamala Harris and Rep. Loretta Sanchez, both Democrats, are fighting to represent a state that’s home to the nation’s biggest tech companies. Harris has the backing of executives from Facebook, Airbnb, Yahoo and other big-name firms. RNC: DON’T COUNT US OUT ON THE GROUND — Conventional political wisdom holds that Democrats have a killer field-organizing advantage over Republicans. But over at the RNC, they're offering a counter-argument, which boils down to: “It’s just not true this cycle.” They say that about a year ago, well before Donald Trump won the GOP nomination, they began a deliberate effort to swell their volunteer corps, partly by using data modeling of existing volunteers to find others like them. New potential recruits were then targeted via social media, digital video, and online ads under the banner of Where You Lead. — The RNC volunteers are being backstopped by some 3,100 paid field staff — or five times the number they had for Mitt Romney four years ago. “The field team decided to redo their operation this year to reflect much more of what we used to do back in ’04 with Bush-Cheney, and what, I think, Obama did a great job expanding,” RNC chief digital officer Gerrit Lansing tells Nancy. “Basically, community organizing: Having a massive amount of people who were trained and could go and recruit more volunteers to get a huge amount of doors knocked.” Today’s turnout will be a fascinating test of which side of the aisle is right. HOUSING ON THE BALLOT IN SILICON VALLEY — Some of the nation’s wealthiest communities in Silicon Valley are voting on ballot measures to develop more affordable housing. In Santa Clara County, home to Apple, HP and Intel, Measure A would authorize the local government to issue a $950 million bond, paid for by an increase in property taxes over the course of thirty years. Residents in Alameda County, home to Tesla and Pandora, will vote on a $580 million bond measure. And in San Mateo County, the home base for Facebook, voters will pass judgment on a 20-year extension of a half-cent sales tax increase approved four years ago. — On the state level, Proposition 54 may infuse a bit more tech into California’s legislative process. The rule would require that all bills be published on the internet for 72 hours before lawmakers are able to vote on them. It would also force the legislature to share all of its activity via downloadable audiovisual recordings on the internet. PODESTA FILES: APPLE CEO WAS EARLY CLINTON ADOPTER — Back in June of 2015, Apple boss Tim Cook was described by a Clinton campaign official as someone who is “not very political” but “loves HRC,” using the Democrat’s initials as shorthand. That’s according to an email, sent the week after Clinton had formally kicked-off her campaign, per a WikiLeaks disclosure of digital goodies said to be hacked from the account of campaign chairman John Podesta. Campaign finance chairman Dennis Cheng adds that former EPA administrator Lisa Jackson, then-and-now an Apple exec, was helping Cook to get more engaged in politics, including holding a few Senate fundraisers. The thread seems to reference a meeting between the campaign and Cook that they were cooking up for three days hence. MERGER MANEUVERING — Watch for industry rivals to try to work the $85 billion AT&T-Time Warner deal to their advantage, reports Bloomberg. “The merger offers competitors and partners a rare opportunity to cut more favorable deals with both companies in exchange for their public endorsement, which can be valuable in getting regulators to sign off,” according to the story. It quotes one analyst as saying Netflix will play a key role; the company’s CEO, Reed Hastings, has offered support for the deal if AT&T doesn’t favor Time Warner-held HBO. FCC PUSHED ON DAKOTA ACCESS PROTESTS — Digital activists want the FCC to investigate whether law enforcement used wireless jammers or surveillance equipment on cellphone signals at the Dakota Access Pipeline protests in Standing Rock, N.D. Demand Progress launched an FCC petition over the weekend, which by Monday afternoon had collected more than 20,000 signatures. The petition cites #NoDAPL protesters as saying their cell signals suddenly disappeared as police moved in on the assembly late last month, according to the petition. An FCC spokesman declined comment. A 2014 agency enforcement advisory notes that rules against cellphone jamming apply to local law enforcement, but Donnell Hushka, a spokeswoman with the Morton County Sheriff’s Department in North Dakota, told MT: “We aren’t using this technology, do not own this technology and have no plans to acquire or use it in future.” QUICK DOWNLOADS A second Samsung phone model could be exploding, too: A customer in France reported that her Galaxy J5 caught fire and exploded this past weekend.

However, 77 per cent of Canadians say they are satisfied with the level of technology at their jobs – a stark contrast to their global counterparts, the company said. Nor was it the only way that Dell found Canadians breaking rank with international trends: When it came to low-tech versus high-tech office perks, 45 per cent of Canadians preferred the former, versus 29 per cent globally; Half of us would willingly use virtual and augmented reality products at their office, compared to 66 per cent globally; Less than half of Canadians believe artificial intelligence will make jobs easier, versus 62 per cent of global respondents; 90 per cent of Canadians prefer face-to-face interaction over remote communication, compared to 57 per cent internationally. However, this comparative conservatism among Canadians when it comes to embracing new workplace technology doesn’t mean we’re averse to it, Dell noted: When asked if they had plans to participate in the so-called “sharing economy,” illustrated by Uber and Airbnb, 60 per cent of Canadian respondents said they planned to embrace it, a rate consistent with their global counterparts. Then there were the 42 per cent of Canadian employees who said their workplaces weren’t smart enough. Moreover, only 39 per cent expected to be working in a smart office over the next five years, whereas 57 per cent of global respondents did. The findings indicate that the more access Canadian employees have to technology, and the more experience they have using it, the more likely they were to say their workplace wasn’t going far enough: 35 per cent of respondents said their home was more cutting edge than work, for instance, a number that rose to 41 per cent among employees at large enterprises. Unsurprisingly, millennials were also found to embrace new technology more quickly than their global peers: 46 per cent reported believing they will work in an Internet of Things (IoT)-driven smart office within the next five years; and 75 per cent agreed that new office technology could make their jobs easier. In an Oct. 31 statement, Dell EMC Canada CMO Carolyn Rollins said that while Canadians might not presently be early adopters of workplace tech, that’s no excuse for employers to rest on their laurels: “Generational shifts and the increased participation of millennials and youngers in the workforce bring growing expectations that their employers integrate the latest technologies seamlessly and securely into their working lives,” she said. “While this may seem daunting for employers, it’s a business-critical opportunity for Canadian companies to be at the forefront of the future workplace.” To conduct the survey, Dell and Intel commissioned research firm Penn Schoen Berland (PSB) to survey 3,801 full-time employees at small, medium, and large organizations across seven industries (education, government, financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, media and entertainment, and retail) in 10 countries, including 300 from Canada. It’s worth noting that one reason so many Canadians might be satisfied with the level of technology at their jobs is that 83 per cent of Canadian respondents were happy, period, with their jobs, especially remote (90 per cent) and public sector (85 per cent) employees. Meanwhile, technology had nothing to do with why Canadians were satisfied or unsatisfied with their jobs: those who were cited work-life balance (33 per cent) and colleague relationships (26 per cent) as the two job aspects they were happiest with; while those who weren’t cited salary (38 per cent), opportunities for career growth (27 per cent), and flexibility in choosing where to work from (19 per cent) as the three leading reasons they wanted to leave.

When it comes to getting things done, they prefer a PC and browser over anything else. This is a far cry from the “PC is Dead” mantra we’ve been hearing for some time. You can read the survey results yourself. For right now, let’s talk about why Apple’s success with the iPod and iPhone didn’t lead to another digital revolution with the iPad, which was the device that caused all this false uproar. The iPod Success What made the iPod a success over all of the other MP3 players was that Apple was the only vendor that really didn’t care about DRM (digital rights management) and instead focused on ease of use. Sony, which had dominated with the Walkman, had acquired a lot of content and was so concerned about content theft that it locked up its MP3 player with DRM, making it impossible to rip music. Microsoft’s Play for Sure platform didn’t play for sure and was too difficult to use reliably. So by focusing like a laser on what people were going to do anyway, rip CDs, and making it easy, the iPod fueled what was Apple’s impressive turnaround. Microsoft had a strategy to displace the iPod by coming up with a product that was more robust and technology to easily migrate playlists and songs between the two devices. It didn’t execute and exited the market. It was soooo close. The iPhone Success Realizing that in a smartphone, music could be a feature that could cannibalize the iPod, Steve Jobs moved aggressively to cannibalize it himself. The first iPhone was basically an iPod with phone capability and it caused the demise of the iPod, eventually, once he got it to work as a viable phone. The formula was to take something that was successful, add one key feature that defined an adjacent market, and then move to dominate that market. And given that the cell phone market was vastly larger than the MP3 market, by combining the two, Jobs drove the firm to even greater heights. The iPad Mistake The iPad was basically a larger iPod Touch, so it looked like the same kind of thing that Apple had done to smartphones, which is add a feature and then go after an adjacent market: in this case, PCs. But the problems were three-fold with this move. First, the iPod had been weakened by the iPhone, making it a far weaker launch platform; Apple didn’t want to cannibalize its PCs so never allowed it to fully embrace what the MacOS did; and the product didn’t do telephony so Apple couldn’t cannibalize its smartphone position, which was far stronger. So rather than repeating the iPhone success, it effectively launched an additional product and once again showcased that people generally don’t like to carry three devices. The iPad did make a nice consumption product but, given that most mobile games were on smartphones and games drove performance, after consumers bought one tablet, most tended to stop buying. Then smartphones started to grow to phablet sizes and instead of the iPad taking over for the smartphone, we got a reverse revolution: The smartphone started to displace the tablet, and PCs were pretty much left alone. Microsoft Continuum Microsoft did have a better idea with Continuum, which was to do what Apple should have done: embrace the PC with the smartphone. Several smartphones sort of provide this function today. However, because Intel was never able to be successful with smartphones, or get into a Microsoft phone, and Microsoft never was competitive with mobile apps, the result hasn’t risen to its potential. The HP Elite X3  is the closest to this ideal in market but because it uses an ARM processor, its Windows capability is very limited and HP Inc. rightly targets this at a business market where it does have some potential. Rumors said a Dell product running an Intel processor was in the works but allegedly has been cancelled, but the issue would still be mobile apps and whether the phone could also embrace the Android marketplace (something that the Kindle does, but not perfectly, largely by forking Android). But emulators are possible, Android apps tend to be written to run on older phones, and Microsoft has allegedly been working on this since 2014. The best strategy might be to wait until Google is hit by an anti-trust action out of the UK before launching this feature, and then use that as a lever to help assure not only that apps will initially work but that Google won’t work to break compatibility once it is in place. Currently, Google, like Microsoft unsuccessfully did in the 1990s, is fighting the EU charges. Wrapping Up: Microsoft Is So Close The recipe for success that the iPhone showcased was to embrace and then cannibalize a market where Apple was both dominant and successful. The iPad needed to cannibalize the iPhone and the Mac, but it didn’t do either, even though that was the initial promise. That promise did hurt the PC market but because of consumers’ unwillingness to carry three devices, particularly when, as smartphones increased in size, they could actually better cannibalize tablets, a reverse trend emerged. Now the bigger risk is that smartphones eventually cannibalize PCs. Microsoft has the best elements of a plan in place but it still needs to execute. The elements of success are Windows phones that can run a full selection of Windows and Android apps, and this may hinge on what the EU eventually does to Google. For now, the PC isn’t going anyplace, largely because it appears that no one, including Apple, is yet willing to put all of the elements together to dislodge it. But Microsoft is again soooo close.

It sees problems with software-defined, hyper-converged systems and traditional array-based products because they can't meet the needs of customers that are getting "SaaSified," in that they want software provided as a service. To do that, Kaminario says the storage infrastructure has to have five guiding principles: Rackscale economics Disaggregated capacity and compute Dynamically composable systems Simplified stack Smart analytics CEO Dani Golan told a press party at Kaminario's Israeli headquarters that customers emphasize cost-efficiency, scalability and performance. Kaminario says larger SSD drives help on cost efficiency and its K2 arrays support 500GB, 1TB and 2TB drives. Now they say: "Very soon we will quadruple that," which implies 8TB drives and, allowing for marketing hype, possibly means Samsung's 7.4TB drives. Golan said: "We will make a very significant announcement about performance and density ... There will be major-major news on scalability, quadrupling our capability ... We'll introduce a new price-point that will be revolutionary for all-flash again. We'll announce breakthroughs in performance for mixed workloads – essentially doubling that." Kaminario CEO Dani Golan Kaminario sees a way to increase deduplication effectiveness by 30 per cent, with an announcement coming in 2017, and dedupe development progress continuing beyond that. Our understanding is that the announcement could come in the first half of next year, possibly the first quarter. Over the longer term, NVMe over Fabrics will help with disaggregating compute and capacity in the K2 array with NVMeF-connected shelves and an ability to dynamically create virtual K2 arrays with varying amounts of compute and capacity. The network shelves need a ROCE target device to connect them to an NVMe fabric, and that device could be Intel-based or ARM-based. The ARM route may take longer to arrive, but would be less expensive. This composability capability will use a virtualization layer and will enable fault domains to be isolated to virtual arrays and not a full physical K2 array. There will be global spares for compute (controllers) and storage. We also expect to see the Clarity cloud-based monitoring and predictive analytics tool to have automatic performance tuning through alert-triggered scripting routines – "global" – meaning across a data center or even beyond that. Kaminario could also move to selling its controller software on its own along with networked capacity shelves. Kaminario market position It's perceived that Kaminario is lagging the leaders in the all-flash array market but Golan says they – the big five – as well as a group of five wannabee players, have a problem: "My belief is that three and a half of them don't have a good answer for next-generation storage and nor do the wannabee big five." He mentions Cisco, Oracle, Huawei, and Lenovo, and also component suppliers that want to get into all-flash arrays. It takes five to seven years to mature a storage product and its stack, and they don't have the time because the market is developing too fast. They will have to partner to get the technology, and Kaminario will be ready and waiting. It's tectonic shift time for the leaders and the balance of power in storage. Reg Comment Kaminario has hundreds of customers – there are 50 listed in EMEA alone, with the largest customer having a 12PB (effective) system. Its quarterly revenues are growing at triple digits year-on-year. It will not reveal actual customer numbers or its revenues. Golan says: "Going public is our plan; we're not disclosing a specific timeline for a public offering but that is our goal." He's a man on a mission to build a successful stand-alone company. On Golan's heights he wants K2 to be the highest mountain in the all-flash array storage world. ® Sponsored: 10 Reasons LinuxONE is the best choice for Linux workloads Tips and corrections 7 Comments More from The Register A Clarity cloud gathers around K2.

Intel has smashed its own record-breaking spectacle from a year ago, setting 500 drones in flight simultaneously to show off the capabilities of its new firework-killing aircraft, the Shooting Star. Intel only announced its first commercial drone last month, the Falcon 8+ designed for surveying and mapping. But apparently it was busy behind the scenes prior to that, building obstacle-avoidance technologies and drone-development kits to try to inspire new applications in the field. One part of its push into the area has been exploring how drones can be used to create a new kind of light show. Earlier this year it revealed it had used 100 LED-equipped drones flying in a pre-programmed formation and synchronized to the sounds of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony to light up the night sky, claiming a Guinness World Record for the Most Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) airborne simultaneously in the process. Now it has outdone itself in a big way. It's latest Guinness World Record-winning spectacle involves the use of 500 drones flying simultaneously, piloted by one person using a single laptop. Intel says a few improvements and advances were necessary to achieve the feat. The weight of the drones has been cut from more than 2 lb (900 g) to 0.6 lb (280 g) thanks to a much lighter plastic and foam frame. A new flight controller, which is the same used to fly the 18-rotor Volocopter, means a light show can now be arranged in a few days rather than five months, and allows for a much higher level of precision. For the previous Drone 100 effort, Intel's programmers had to map a path for each drone manually, but the company says the new software can take just about any picture and use algorithms to determine the fastest flight path automatically. "We run through a simulation on a laptop, see how it works, and then load it onto the drones with a click of a button," says Natalie Cheung, drone light show boss at Intel. Intel appears to have no plans actually sell its Shooting Star drone. Rather, it intends to fly them to publicly demonstrate the advantages of using unmanned aircraft in place of conventional pyrotechnics, which include better safety and the potential for more choreographed sequences. But beyond that, the technology demonstrates the advances being made in having autonomous drones work together to pull off certain tasks, something that has real potential to reshape things like construction, city maintenance and military defense.

That's because the companies that teamed up to make Android a hit -- principally Google and Samsung Electronics Co. -- are increasingly working at cross purposes. Google has just started to sell its first smartphone that competes with its ostensible partner Samsung, and for now it has kept for itself crucial voice-assistant technology that makes the Google phones more appealing than those of other Android manufacturers.  Now Samsung plans to use its own digital assistant for smartphones in competition with Google. Other makers of Android smartphone handsets, principally Chinese firms such as Xiaomi Corp., have also extricated themselves from parts of the Android system.

Coalitions only hold together if all the partners are successful and share common interests. That's no longer a given with Android.  Market Share of Android Smartphones 87.6% Google started backing Android in the first place because it was worried Apple (and Microsoft, and the phone companies) could find ways to disadvantage or block Google's web search on smartphones. Android was Google's effort to build its own smartphone playground and ensure Google stayed relevant as more computing activities moved from PC web browsers to mobile gadgets. That strategy panned out. But controlling the operating system no longer gives Google a guarantee to siphon and harness all the world's digital information. The more time people spend using Facebook, Snapchat or Siri on their phones -- even on Android phones -- the more data is being generating out of Google's reach. Wresting back some of that power and consumer information is a significant motivation behind Google's efforts to create smartphones that it designs and controls from the chips to the apps. For their part, Samsung and other handset makers know they can no longer rely on Google for their mobile existence. Samsung agreed in October to buy Viv Labs, a startup working on a Siri-like voice technology. In China and India, local companies sell Android smartphones with local versions of app stores in place of Google Play. In some cases, it's possible to use Android smartphones without interacting much with Google. All these moves are signs of the fraying Android coalition. The coalition of the willing isn't willing anymore. It isn't unusual for cracks to emerge in tech alliances. Partners Microsoft, Intel and personal computer manufacturers haven't always been on the same page about the Windows operating system -- a business that mirrors Android in many ways. At times, PC hardware makers felt as if Microsoft was getting the better end of the deal. While Microsoft got rich on Windows software, PC hardware makers were left to fight over single-digit percentage profit margins at best from making and selling Windows computers. In the Android alliance, Google makes the lion's share of the profits, too.  King of Android Google's parent company generates far higher profits than Samsung, the most successful manufacturer of Android smartphones Source: Company disclosures In short, it's hard to stay friends for long in the technology industry, as Google is finding out.  The Windows coalition has held through the turmoil, though Windows never branched far beyond personal computers and computer servers to other devices. The PC is now a fringe of computing, and Windows isn't even the heart of Microsoft anymore. It's not clear how this all shakes out for Android and Google. In contrast to Windows, Android is moving far beyond the smartphone into powering thermostats, web streaming gadgets hooked up to televisions and virtual reality headsets. But if the coalition can't stay together, the big risk is Android turns out to be a crucial technology, but not an enduring one -- the laser disc player of computing.  This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners. Samsung has also developed its own smartphone operating system, Tizen, as an alternative to Android.

Android was Google’s effort to build its own smartphone playground and ensure Google stayed relevant as more computing activities moved from PC web browsers to mobile gadgets. That strategy panned out. But controlling the operating system no longer gives Google a guarantee to siphon and harness all the world’s digital information. The more time people spend using Facebook, Snapchat or Siri on their phones — even on Android phones — the more data is being generating out of Google’s reach. Wresting back some of that power and consumer information is a significant motivation behind Google’s efforts to create smartphones that it designs and controls from the chips to the apps. For their part, Samsung and other handset makers know they can no longer rely on Google for their mobile existence. Samsung agreed in October to buy Viv Labs, a start-up working on a Siri-like voice technology. In China and India, local companies sell Android smartphones with local versions of app stores in place of Google Play. In some cases, it’s possible to use Android smartphones without interacting much with Google. All these moves are signs of the fraying Android coalition. The coalition of the willing isn’t willing anymore. It isn’t unusual for cracks to emerge in tech alliances. Partners Microsoft, Intel and PC manufacturers haven’t always been on the same page about the Windows operating system — a business that mirrors Android in many ways. At times, PC hardware makers felt as if Microsoft was getting the better end of the deal. While Microsoft got rich on Windows software, PC hardware makers were left to fight over single-digit percentage profit margins at best from making and selling Windows computers. In the Android alliance, Google makes the lion’s share of the profits, too. In short, it’s hard to stay friends for long in the technology industry, as Google is finding out. The Windows coalition has held through the turmoil, though Windows never branched far beyond PCs and computer servers to other devices. The PC is now a fringe of computing, and Windows isn’t even the heart of Microsoft anymore. It’s not clear how this all shakes out for Android and Google. In contrast to Windows, Android is moving far beyond the smartphone into powering thermostats, Web streaming gadgets hooked up to televisions and virtual reality headsets. But if the coalition can’t stay together, the big risk is Android turns out to be a crucial technology, but not an enduring one — the laser disc player of computing.  — (c) Bloomberg LP Share this article Tweet André Schild Excellent analysis! Skerminkel Android is simply becoming too big. It is a fantastic success and the fact that it is open source is probably the single greatest benefit to consumers. Unfortunately progress requires competition and a monopoly not very conducive to that. Andrew Fraser While there is little wrong with the facts presented in the article (except for using Siri on an android phone), I’m not convinced about the conclusions. Yes, Android is big and somewhat fragmented, but Android as such is not Google’s main business. Google is a service business, selling advertising primarily, and all products are designed to supplement that. The Pixel is not the first Google phone, there have been multiple generations of Nexus phones made by manufacturers like Motorola, Huawei, Asus, LG and, yes, even Samsung. And Google doesn’t even make the Pixel, it is manufactured by HTC. Arguing that, because Samsung is considering introducing a voice assistant, that the Android coalition is foundering is specious. Samsung has considered releasing devices without Android in the past using an OS called Tizen, but stopped that project because it couldn’t replace the huge number of services and applications available in the android stable. That hasn’t changed. While every handset manufacturer will try to differentiate their offering, that doesn’t mean that the Android alliance is dying. On the contrary, having multiple companies developing services on the core of Android is healthy for innovation. As Mark Twain may have said – the news of Android’s imminent demise are greatly exaggerated. André Schild Except for the sheer fact that Android doesn’t have just one, single “core” and is as fragmented as dark matter over the entire universe. There are thousands of versions running on even more devices, hence “somewhat fragmented” is quite the understatement 🙂 Andrew Fraser That’s true, but also a bit of a bogeyman argument. Yes there are multiple versions of Android in the wild but what of it? André Schild “Multiple”? Another big understatement 🙂 Fragmentation =-> losing control =-> negative impact on general product quality (security, UX, performance, version management, optimization, versatility etc etc.) Can’t make it any simpler than that 🙂 But that’s just my opinion… Kabelo Mpyatona I agree.

He goes on to reveal that Apple had in fact built several touchscreen prototypes that however didn’t impress Apple executives enough to greenlight the project. The video runs five minutes and twenty seconds long. Federighi is clearly excited for the Touch Bar, the new MacBook Pro’s marquee feature. Other Apple executives went on a PR offensive following the unexpected backlash over some of the controversial MacBook Pro features, like the removal of all ports in favor of USB-C, yesteryear’s Intel Skylake chips that don’t support 32GB RAM and more. Phil Schiller, Apple’s marketing boss, recently explained the reasoning behind the removal of an SD card slot while Chief Design Officer Jony Ive defended Apple’s stance on not releasing a touchscreen Mac. I wouldn’t go as far as to call these interviews damage control on Apple’s part. That’s because Apple’s been saying for years that a touchscreen Mac wouldn’t make much sense from a productivity standpoint due to the Gorilla arm syndrome. According to Ive, Apple didn’t feel that the Mac was the right place for a multitouch touchscreen “for a bunch of practical reasons”.

Rolf Bause I have to say: I share Spanish guys view on that matter way more than Craigs 🙂 Jayy Can any spanish speakers tell me the context of that subbed video? I’m curious to know what’s so funny! Lol FFF84 Even so I still think that the touch bar is so gimmicky (and I might be wrong). Because your eyes normally concentrate on the the screen and due to the fact that the touch bar has a dynamic content and you can’t feel it like keys you need to look each time you want to used. I think every one how has a Nintendo 3DS knows what I means. you (or at least I) can never use both screens at the same time or use one while looking at the other. askep3 At the same time, look at the pages/word touch bar usage, it takes the entire tool bar at the top and puts it on the touch bar. Either way you would have looked away from your writing, and moved the mouse to click on something like bold or italics, but now instead you can just tap FFF84 But in my opinion (and personal experience with the 3DS) looking elsewhere on the screen is not as bad as looking on the keyboard. Anyway I might be wrong and testing the bar is the only way to find out. Unfortunately I’m not going to be able to as I decided not to upgrade my mid 2012 mac pro because of the pricing. In Europe base model 13″ with touch bar starts at 1999Euro. 1699 for the one without a bar.

Skip to content Military Technologies Military Press Releases eBay’s New Holiday Campaign Captures the Emotion and Excitement of Giving the Perfect Gift SAN JOSE, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–eBay (www.ebay.com) today unveils a new holiday campaign, “The Gift They’re Waiting For Is Waiting on eBay,” and debuts television spots on November 9 – marking the brand’s first holiday national television ads in nearly two years. The efforts are part of eBay’s broader holiday mission to help shoppers find perfect gifts for everyone on their list, by offering the best choice and amazing deals all season long. “Our new campaign illustrates why eBay is a top destination for holiday shopping – delivering incredible inventory and inspiration, along with a seamless shopping experience,” said Suzy Deering, Chief Marketing Officer for eBay North America. “As a global marketplace, eBay is the only place to find this year’s most in-demand items, from small and mid-size sellers to top brands like Mattel®, to one-of-a-kind personal or bespoke items. We empower shoppers to be the ultimate gift-givers with our unparalleled selection.” eBay collaborated with the San Francisco-based advertising agency Pereira & O’Dell to develop the new television creative. The marquee spot, titled “The Giver,” takes viewers on the emotional and gratifying journey of finding and giving perfect holiday presents. The marketing campaign also uses digital video, display ads and social media to inspire shoppers looking for unique gift ideas this season. “While the convenience of holiday shopping has increased, the thoughtfulness of gifting has simultaneously decreased,” said PJ Pereira, Chief Creative Officer and Co-founder of Pereira & O’Dell. “The holidays are about spending quality time with family and friends, and the gifts we exchange should reflect these special relationships. eBay is uniquely positioned to help people find perfect gifts for the ones they love, and the new campaign brings this idea to life.” The Gift They’re Waiting For Each year, it becomes increasingly difficult for shoppers to find gifts they truly can’t wait to give. Last year, two-thirds of Americans gave up on their holiday shopping due to a lack of time or inspiration. Even more challenging is that consumers are failing to find great gifts at great prices; 74 percent of Americans surveyed struggled to find deals for the gifts on their shopping lists.1 “In the lead up to this holiday, no single standout gift has emerged, which represents a significant departure from past seasons,” said Hal Lawton, Senior Vice President of eBay North America. “Since shoppers aren’t clamoring for a specific must have item there’s actually more pressure to find perfect gifts. With more than 1 billion listings, only eBay promises unique items and exclusive deals, combined with a cutting edge shopping experience, fast and free delivery, and great service.” Throughout the holidays, eBay will feature some of the most competitive deals on must haves from top brands across electronics, fashion, home and toys: eBay’s Holiday Hub (http://www.ebay.com/holiday) combines gift inspiration with amazing deals and inventory from brands like Mattel® and Sony PlayStation®. Browse and buy the season’s most coveted items – pieces from KENZO x H&M and FENTY x Puma, along with Adidas YEEZY Boosts, an iRobot Roomba, and the Nutri Ninja® – and visit eBay’s Daily Deals page (deals.ebay.com), where 100% of items ship for free. On the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, eBay will host a collection of deals exclusively created for mobile shoppers using the eBay app, making it even easier to shop on-the-go. eBay will also introduce a new feature on the Holiday homepage – a countdown clock – to enable shoppers to track when new deals will be released. All season long, eBay will reveal new gift inspiration and innovative ways to shop, as well as one-of-a-kind experiences through eBay for Charity benefitting a variety of causes. Visit ebay.com/holiday for more information. eBay By the Numbers eBay, Inc. has 165 million active buyers worldwide 81% of all merchandise sold on eBay is new, and our wide selection keeps growing ~87% of items sold on eBay are Buy It Now – no bidding necessary Approximately 1 billion listings at any given time 100% free shipping on all items in Daily Deals About eBay eBay Inc.

Methodological Notes1: The eBay Survey was conducted by Wakefield Research (www.wakefieldresearch.com) among 1,000 nationally representative U.S. adults ages 18+, between October 7th and October 13th, 2016, using an email invitation and an online survey. Quotas have been set to ensure reliable and accurate representation of the U.S. adult population ages 18+. Results of any sample are subject to sampling variation. The magnitude of the variation is measurable and is affected by the number of interviews and the level of the percentages expressing the results. For the interviews conducted in this particular study, the chances are 95 in 100 that a survey result does not vary, plus or minus, by more than 3.1 percentage points from the result that would be obtained if interviews had been conducted with all persons in the universe represented by the sample.

You can also make the case that Red Hat, the leader in Open Source software, saved the CFL because without the Tiger Cats it would have been very hard to sustain the league. Red Hat’s connection to the CFL team does not necessarily begin with its owner Bob Young, the Hamilton-born co-founder of Red Hat. It actually starts with Bob’s younger brother Michael, who was a die-hard Tiger Cats fan. Young bought the struggling team in 2003 out of bankruptcy. The main reason he did it was to honour his brother Michael who died a year earlier from melanoma. But Young had other reasons to acquire the Tiger Cats. He knew growing up in Hamilton what the team meant to the community. And, so he decided to give himself the title of Caretaker instead of President or Owner. And, he told the fans he was willing to incur losses to maintain stability for the franchise for the next generation of fans. Bob Young “The Ticats story is a cute story,” Young admits. But the team’s revival was fueled by Red Hat’s rise starting in 1994. But back in 1994 things were beyond tough for the company. They were in the midst of releasing a new version of the software and it was missing some key management tools needed to give the new version a chance at success. Also there was no sight of any sales. “We had no money,” Young jokes now. The company was in crisis mode and Young was searching for answers. At the same time, Red Hat was open to what Young calls “Love Money Financing”. This is where family members can invest in the company. One of those family members was his brother Michael. “Michael never graduated high school and he would only see the very good in people. My Dad would always worry about Michael and he managed his investments. He too gave me money,” he said. Then in 1998 the breakthrough came as venture capitalists got over their reluctance with Open Source and the company was also boosted by significant investments from Intel and NetScape. Red Hat investors were suddenly looking at an eight times return. But Bob’s brother Michael did not sell, which went against is father’s wishes. Young’s father did end up cashing in his shares at that time, but Michael for some reason held on telling his older brother that he could do more with the company. A year later the bet Michael made on his brother paid off big time. Red Hat went public and the stock rocketed up the charts. That’s when Michael sold his stake in Red Hat. Michael would not survive melanoma cancer. His estate was left to his two brothers. The youngest brother decided to honour Michael who loved comedy by opening a club in Toronto’s entertainment district. And, as luck would have it; when Bob found out about the comedy club the news broke that the Tiger Cats went bust. “Michael was a big Tiger Cats fan and when I got the cheque that same week I could not let my brother down and have his favourite football team pass away too. We are not in this for ourselves but for our community. That is why I bought the Tiger Cats.” Post to Twitter Post to Facebook Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Share with Google+ More Articles Future Adobe products could let you put words into someone’s mouth Big banks have nothing to fear, but need to learn, from fintech, Salesforce says Tech in Sports CFL, football, Hamilton Tiger Cats, open source, red hat PageBooks - A collection of articles chosen by our editors and compiled into a magazine format designed for our readers.

But what can you do if your PC keeps waking up on its own? Here’s how to figure out what’s waking it up, and how to prevent it. When you put your PC to sleep, it enters a power-saving state where it shuts down power to most of the PC’s components, keeping just enough power trickling to keep the memory refreshed. This lets you quickly wake the computer back up to the same state it was in when it went to sleep—including any documents and folders you had open. One of the differences between sleep and hibernation is that when a PC is alseep, activity from certain devices can wake it up. Scheduled tasks can also be configured to wake the PC up so that they can run. RELATED ARTICLES PSA: Don’t Shut Down Your Computer, Just Use Sleep (or Hibernation) What’s the Difference Between Sleep and Hibernate in Windows? How to Find Out What’s Waking Your PC Up Before you can fix the problem, you need to determine the problem. There are a few different steps you’ll probably need to take here, as no one solution fits everyone. See the Last Thing That Woke Your PC The first step in figuring out why your PC is waking up before you want it to is determining what’s doing the waking. You can usually figure out what event caused your computer to wake up most recently with a simple Command Prompt command. Start the Command Prompt by hitting Start, typing “command,” and then selecting the “Command Prompt” app. In the Command Prompt window, type the following command and press Enter: powercfg -lastwake I can tell from the output of the command above, for example, that I used the power button to wake my PC. You may also see listed devices—like your mouse, keyboard, or network adapter—or events like wake timers or automatic maintenance. This won’t always give you the information you need, but often it will. Explore Other Wake Up Events with Event Viewer RELATED ARTICLE Using Event Viewer to Troubleshoot Problems While the Command Prompt command we just talked about is great for showing you what last woke your PC, sometimes you need to go a bit further back in history to see what’s woken it up before. For that, we’ll turn to Event Viewer, a handy logging tool that will help us see when your computer turned off (be that because it was shut down, put to sleep, or hibernated) and when it woke up. To open Event Viewer, hit Start, type “event,” and then select “Event Viewer.” In the left-hand pane, drill down to Event Viewer (Local) > Windows Logs > System. You’ll see a lot of information here, but don’t worry. You don’t need to read through or attempt to understand everything going on in the log. We’re going to filter it to just the stuff we need to look at. Right-click the “System” log and choose “Filter Current Log.” In the Filter Current Log window, on the “Event sources” drop-down menu, select the “Power-Troubleshooter” option and then click “OK.” Back in the main Event Viewer window, you’ll see that we’ve filtered out the hundreds of messages that aren’t relevant to our problem and honed right in on the thing we care about: when the computer is waking up from a low-power state. In the new filtered view, you can scroll through every instance where your computer has woken over the duration of the log (which should be hundreds of entries). What you should focus on is the time the event was logged (did it wake at a time you were at the computer or was it a random middle-of-the-night wake up call) and what Wake Source is indicated. If the Wake Source says “Power Button,” that indicates that the power button on the PC was pressed to wake it up—an action you most likely took yourself. If the Wake Source says something like “Device–HID-Compliant Mouse (or Keyboard),” that indicates the PC is configured for key presses and mouse movements to wake it. If the Wake Source lists your network adapter, that indicates your PC is configured so that incoming network activity can wake it up—something that’s useful if you like having your PC go to sleep but still need it available to other network devices at times. If the Wake Source says “Timer,” it means that a scheduled task woke the computer. The source information usually includes some indication about the task that woke the PC. For example, in the previous screenshot, I can tell that my PC was woken up in order to do a scheduled restart after an update. You may also see something like “Wake Source: Unknown,” which is a bit more cryptic but at least it tells when the PC was awoken. Once you’ve established that there is in fact a pattern of odd computer wake up calls and you’ve identified the source, it’s time to do something about it. How to Stop Your PC From Waking Up Randomly Hopefully, one of the above tricks helped you figure out what’s waking your PC. Now, it’s time to solve the problem. Skip down to the section that applies to your situation. Limit Hardware Devices That Can Wake Your PC As you probably noticed from looking through Event Viewer logs, there are four primary hardware devices that can wake your PC: mice, keyboards, network adapters, and power buttons (or laptop lids if that’s what you’re using). You can easily view a complete list of the hardware devices allowed to wake your PC with a Command Prompt command. Open up a Command Prompt window and run the following command: powercfg -devicequery wake_armed In this example, I’ve got several devices that are allowed to wake my PC, including an Intel Ethernet adapter, two keyboards (I switch between regular and gaming keyboards), and a mouse. Whatever your setup, now that you know what devices can wake your PC, you can head over to Device Manager to tell them not to. We’ve covered in detail how to prevent your mouse from waking your PC and how to prevent network activity from waking your PC. So, in our example here, we’ll be preventing the keyboard from waking the PC. Why would you want to do this? One word: cats. (This should, however, work for other devices that may be waking your computer—not just keyboards.) RELATED ARTICLES How to Stop Your Mouse from Waking Up Your Windows PC How to Stop Network Activity from Waking Your Windows PC Open Device manager by pressing the Windows key, typing “Device Manager,” and then pressing Enter. In the Device Manager window, locate the device you want to prevent from waking your computer. It will have the same name as it does in the output of the powercfg command you just ran. Right-click the device and select “Properties” from the context menu. On the “Power Management” tab of the device’s properties window, disable the “Allow this device to wake the computer” option and then click “OK.” While you’ve got Device Manager open, go ahead and disallow any other devices you don’t want waking up your computer. When you’re done, you can exit Device Manager. Disable Wake Timers and Scheduled Tasks The other thing that can wake your PC is a scheduled task. Some scheduled tasks—for example, an antivirus app that schedules a scan—can set a wake timer to wake your PC at specific time to run an app or command. To see a list of wake timers set on your computer, you can use a Command Prompt command. You’ll have to run Command Prompt with administrative privileges for this one. To do so, hit Start, type “command,” and when you see the Command Prompt app, right-click it and choose “Run as administrator.” In the Command Prompt window, type the following command and then press Enter: powercfg -waketimers In this example, you can see I have one wake timer—a scheduled task set to check whether I have any large files queued for downloading so that I can have the downloading happen when I’m not using the PC. You have to choices for stopping this: you can disable that specific wake timer, or disable all wake timers. RELATED ARTICLE How to Automatically Run Programs and Set Reminders With the Windows Task Scheduler If you just want to stop one task from waking your computer, you can uninstall the app that created the task or adjust the scheduled task settings. You can read the full instructions for working with scheduled tasks in our article on automatically running programs with the Windows Task Scheduler, but here’s the short version. Find the task in Task Scheduler, right-click it, and then choose “Properties”. In the Properties window, on the “Conditions” tab, turn off the “Wake the computer to run this task” option. This leaves the scheduled task in place and, if your PC is awake, Windows will run the task. It just won’t wake the PC in order to do it. If you don’t want any programs waking your computer up automatically, you can disable wake timers entirely. To do so open the Power Options Control Panel app it by hitting Start, typing “power options,” and then pressing Enter. In the Power Options window, click the “Change plan settings” link next to the plan you use. In the next window, click the “Change advanced power settings” link. Expand the “Sleep” entry, expand the “Allow wake timers” entry below it, and then set the entries below it to “Disabled.” If you’re on a laptop, you’ll see two entries—“On battery” and “Plugged in”—and you can configure these for different settings if you want. If you’re using a desktop PC, you’ll only see one setting under the “Allow wake timers” entry, as in this example. Note that if you’re using Windows 10, you’ll also have a third option other than just enabling or disabling the wake timer. This option is called “Important Wake Timers Only” and wakes your PC only for major Windows system events like a scheduled restart of your PC outside active hours following a Windows update. You can try setting your wake timers to “Important Wake Timers Only” and see if it solves your problems. If your PC is still waking up more often than you’d like, you can always come back and set wake timers to “Disabled” instead. Prevent Automatic Maintenance From Waking Your PC By default, Windows runs automatic maintenance tasks at 2:00 am every night if you’re not using your computer. It’s also set to wake your PC from sleep to run those tasks. These tasks include things like checking to see if your hard drive needs defragmenting, running system diagnostics, checking for disk volume errors, and more. They are important tasks to have run periodically, but if  you’d prefer that Windows not wake your PC to do it, you can turn that setting off. We’re using Windows 10 as our example here, but you’ll find the settings in the same place in Windows 8 and 7. In Control Panel, switch to icon view and then open the Security and Maintenance app. On the Security and Maintenance page, expand the “Maintenance” section and then click “Change maintenance settings.” On the Automatic Maintenance page, turn off the “Allow scheduled maintenance to wake up my computer at the scheduled time” option. Of course, you can also set the schedule time to something you like better if you want. If you do turn off Windows’ ability to wake your PC to run maintenance tasks, you should still let it run those maintenance tasks occasionally. You can do that by setting the scheduled time to when you’re more likely to have your PC turned on or you can do it manually by clicking “Start maintenance” back on the main Security and Maintenance page. Sleep is a valuable tool for preserving energy while still keeping your PC immediately available when you need it. While you’ll likely want some devices (like your keyboard) and some scheduled tasks to be able to wake up your PC, it’s good to know that you have some tools for investigating why it’s waking up and options for stopping it from happening when you don’t want it to. JOIN THE DISCUSSION (11 REPLIES) November 7, 2016 Steve Kohn Long a lurker at HTG, I'm moved to register just to express admiration for such a well written article. Many thanks to HTG and the author. November 7, 2016 Yu0 Great summary! Just really, it is kind of sad, that this is even necessary. Laptops should really disable all wake-events other than opening the lid and pressing the power button when they are not connected to the power grid. When sleeping on battery, chances are that the battery time will be needed and that the laptop is inside a bag or other storage, where waking risks heat-damage to either the device or its environment. Hence wake-on-battery should be whitelist-based, rather than having to track down the origin of unwanted wake-events. If needed for centralized maintenance in a company, it could still be changed by group-policies. November 7, 2016 Christian M. off-topic, but that cover picture made me laugh a good time! November 8, 2016 Rocky Rodenbach My computer would wake up during the night sometimes, and I figured out through observation it was Windows update that was causing it to come on. It wouldn't initiate, but just wake the computer from sleep mode. Unchecking "Allow this device to wake up the computer" is also helpful especially things like network cards. November 9, 2016 Rob B Excellent article!My power settings should prevent wake timers while on battery, but it does not appear to be working. Using powercfg, it appears that svchost.exe woke the system to run 'Maintenance Activator' last night, waking my laptop (Dell XPS13 running Windows 10) about every 15 minutes and draining the battery in the process. I don't know if that relates to Windows update or McAfee. My guess is that it is related to Windows update, but most of the wake options are greyed out in Task Scheduler. Any suggestions for a fix? November 9, 2016 Walter Glenn @Rob_B: Thanks! I do have a suggestion for you. Windows does automatically run maintenance tasks daily when you're not using your PC. If you would prefer that these tasks not wake your computer, you can make that happen. In Control Panel (category view), go to Security and Maintenance. Expand the Maintenance section and click "Change maintenance settings." Here, you can choose the time maintenance tasks run and also turn off the option to wake your PC to run them. I should probably add that to the article UPDATE: I did add it toward the end of the article if you want better guidance with screenshots! November 10, 2016 Yu0 Had the issue today again. In the evening, I closed the laptop, sending it to standby. In the morning I put it into the bag. Halfway in the tram I had to open the bag, because it was smelling of burnt dust. Thankfully it didn't actually damage anything though. Really, I see no good reason to allow a laptop to wake from sleep by default when not connected to a power-supply. At best it wastes battery when needed otherwise, at worst it is a fire hazard. November 10, 2016 Yu0 By any chance, do you use Google Chrome? I noticed that something sleep is prevented entirely, until Chrome is closed. The device will go to sleep, but will wake up right away. November 11, 2016 Keith R. Starkey Great, great, article. Since of of those major updates for Win 10, I've had problems left and right trying to get my system to both sleep/hibernate and then stay that way. This article will help a lot. Thanks! November 13, 2016 Sean Ivo Regardless of how your computer wakes up, there are programs out there that can ensure it goes back to sleep. One example is MollieSoft WinSleep, which uses cpu/disk/network usages to put it to sleep when it is under-utilized, on a time schedule. Got Feedback?

Master Herald Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Menu Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Features, News And Update Rumors For Apple MacBook Air 2017, Will It Support Up To 32GB Of RAM? Let’s See Posted By: Arash FekriPosted date: November 08, 2016In: Technology Page 1 of 212» It is expected that a new MacBook Air will launch sometime next year in spite of rumors suggesting that Apple has discontinued the entire lineup. Several reports suggest that the device which was dubbed the MacBook Air 2017 will make a debut next year, hopefully in March. Currently, tech experts and fans are looking forward to the release of the new iPad Pro version. There have been a lot of rumors surrounding the iPad Pro along with its probable successors, and the idea of a new MacBook has been discarded. It is yet to be confirmed that Apple has discontinued the Air series of laptops. MacBook Air series received the last major update back in 2015, and even though it received an update this year, it’s not that significant. The new MacBook Pro 2016 was released last month, but news about the MacBook Air 2017 has not been revealed. According to MacWorld UK, the minor upgrade in 2016 could probably signal the release of a major one next year. Considering that, a 2017 release is still possible for the MacBook Air 2017. In the meantime, WCCFTech revealed that MacBook Air 2017 is happening, but the laptop is expected to be the last entry in the series. An impressive update was not received by the current model, and there isn’t a lot that the company can do to the device because of limitations with dimensions. Considering that, MacBook Air’s legacy of being the thinnest ever laptop could soon be over. However, other reports suggest that it will be lighter and thinner compared to its predecessor. The specifications will be improved, and new batteries should be included on board. It will also come with a cooling module and improved chassis. The device could feature a USB Type-C connection as well. Take all this information with a pinch of salt since the specs, and rumored features are all based on guesses and speculations. It is recommended that you wait for official updates from Apple. Meanwhile, Ming-Chi Kuo, the famous KGI Securities Analyst expects that there will be price cuts for both new and old MacBooks in 2017 along with a refresh which adds 32GB of RAM and more. He also believes that the plethora of USB Type-C devices and software which takes advantage of the Touch Bar will become more advanced, thereby exciting more users. Kuo also expects that refreshed MacBook Pros will be launched in the second half of 2017 and will include support for 32GB RAM. Kuo also mentions that this is dependent on whether the Cannonlake processors are launched by Intel. Many customers have reported that the new MacBook which runs on Skylake processors continues to max out with 16 gigabytes of RAM and also costs more than previous-generation models. Phil Schiller, the Apple marketing chief told in an email to David, a MacRumors reader that if Apple makes a notebook with more than 16GB of RAM, it will start consuming a lot of power. Schiller said during an interview that price is something they care about but the company focuses more on designs for experience instead of price. Kuo expects that the 12-inch MacBook and new MacBook Pros will undergo price-cuts, it is unclear whether Apple will introduce support for a maximum of 32GB RAM for the MacBook 12-inch variants, besides the MacBook Pro.

Excelsior JET Control Panel screenshot Excelsior JET Embedded is a complete implementation of the Java SE Embedded technology, enhanced with an Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) optimizing native code compiler. It helps vendors of Java-powered devices protect their intellectual property and improve the run time characteristics of their Java code. When run on traditional JVMs equipped with Just-In-Time (JIT) compilers, Java applications are known to start slowly and exhibit bad response times until the JIT compiler kicks in and compiles the performance-critical pieces down to native code. These may be non-issues for a server-side enterprise application that runs for many days on a cluster of multiprocessor servers. In the context of an embedded device, however, fast application startup and immediate demonstration of short, consistent response times are often among the top requirements. An AOT compiler enables embedded Java developers to circumvent the restrictions of their target hardware. "AOT compilation not only reduces the startup time of Java applications and eliminates the "JIT non-determinism", as one of our prospects has put it, but also makes reverse engineering of application code much more expensive, which is good for security and intellectual property protection," said Dmitry Leskov, Excelsior's Director of Marketing. The ARM architecture flavors initially targeted by Excelsior JET Embedded are ARMv7-A with VFPv3-D16 extension or better, and 32-bit ARMv8-A. Future versions will also support 64-bit ARMv8 CPUs; support for the lower-end processors will be driven by customer demand. Excelsior JET Embedded 11.3 for Linux/ARM and Intel-based platforms is available for evaluation and purchase immediately direct from Excelsior at https://www.excelsiorjet.com/embedded. Pricing depends on the customer's choice of a support plan and project parameters. Excelsior is an Oracle Java Licensee, so, on the one hand, its product has passed the official compatibility test suite and includes Oracle's implementation of the Java SE Platform API, but, on the other hand, the use of a licensed Java implementation in an embedded device requires paying per-unit royalties to Oracle. Also released today is Excelsior JET 11.3 for desktop and server platforms based on Intel CPUs: https://www.excelsiorjet.com/evaluate About Excelsior LLC Excelsior LLC provides advanced Java-compatible solutions and software development services with particular focus on optimizing compilers, high performance runtime environments, and the Java technology. Excelsior is a Java Authorized Licensee. The company's flagship product, Excelsior JET, is a complete solution for acceleration, protection, and deployment of Java applications.

Microsoft Corp on Tuesday unveiled a larger but lighter version of its Surface Pro tablet as it ramps up efforts to make an impact on the mobile computing market and counter the popularity of Apple Inc's iPad and MacBook Air laptop. Reuters/Brendan McDermid Microsoft is reportedly developing the next generation Surface Phone patiently and it is expected to be for the mass market. The phone could be launched in 2017. In fact, reports suggest that Microsoft could be launching three smartphones from the Microsoft Surface Phone line-up. It was reported back in January that Microsoft had registered SurfacePhone.com domain name and information about the launch of three new smartphones in 2017 is based out of this domain registration. The Microsoft Surface Phone 2017 would be Microsoft’s yet another attempt to make a mark in the smartphone segment especially after the failure of the Windows phones. However, this time Microsoft has been able to establish the Surface brand name and is reportedly bringing a host of specs and features in the Surface Phone. If rumours are to be believed, the basic version of the Microsoft Surface Phone 2017 will have a 4GB RAM while the premium variant will sport an 8GB RAM. There is also a possibility that the Surface Phone will have Intel’s Kaby Lake processor, liquid cooling tech, USB port and also 5.5 inch Active-Matrix Organic Light-emitting Diode display. There have been a lot of speculation regarding the top features the Microsoft Surface Phone 2017 will have such as the rumoured 20MP Carl Zeiss primary camera, compass, proximity sensor, barometer and fingerprint scanner. There have been reports stating that the Microsoft Surface Phone 2017 may also have a fingerprint scanner embedded on the display. This is a trend that is fast catching up. As per WCCF Tech, Microsoft is looking to consolidate the Windows 10 platform via the Surface Phone 2017. It is being designed strictly for business, some tech enthusiasts believe. There is no word on why the launch of the smartphone has been delayed. Many believe that it is due to the Kaby Lake chipset that Microsoft is waiting for. However, there has been no word from Microsoft. Some rumours suggested that the Microsoft Surface Phone 2017 will be able to run both iOS and Android apps on Windows 10 with minimal coding, known as “Bridge Solution.” Submit Correction 0 0 0 Related Microsoft Surface Pro 5 to get 4K/UHD display?

If youve dabbled with Linux distros in the past, then youve likely heard of KDE before. KDE stands for K Desktop Environment and its one of the main desktop environment options (next to GNOME) that can be used on Linux distros. KDE e.V. is a registered non-profit organization that represents the KDE community when in legal and financial matters. The team behind this organization has just announced a new, open source smartphone OS called Plasma Mobile. The team describes Plasma Mobile as a way to turn your smartphone into a fully open hacking device, just like a PC. Those of you who have used KDE in the past might be familiar with the Plasma workspace by the name KDE Plasma. KDE Plasma is available for desktops, netbooks, media centers for TVs, tablets and now mobile devices. If offers an adaptable user interface and in the future it will also offer a rapidly-maturing software system that is developed with an open life cycle. The software has built the Plasma workspace into it, and offers KWIN/Wayland and Voicecall/Ofono while also integrating Plasma Apps, Plasma Widgets, Ubuntu Touch Apps and the possibility of installing Sailfish and Nemo Apps. Plasma Mobiles development team will be aiming to run many Qt/GTK/X11-based applications on the OS, and hope to implement package installation via the apt-get install packagename command. The platform will utilize libhybris on ARM devices while opting for DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) on Intel devices. As of right now, Plasma Mobile only supports the Nexus 5 and the OnePlus One, along with some Intel-based devices. If you want to try this out on the Nexus 5, Plasma Mobile can be installed as a secondary ROM on your device thanks to MultiROM support. The team describes the state of MultiROM support for the Nexus 5 as Solid (so while it isnt perfect, its past the Experimental state). Be sure to check out their forums if you are interested in trying out the software.

The addition of software security services provider Cigital and the provider of complimentary security tools Codiscope will boost its software security offering so that security can be built into every software segment. Terms of the deal are not being disclosed. The acquisition will add complimentary products, services and a highly skilled workforce to Synopsys’ Software Signoff Platform, enabling it to offer a wide range of products and services, from security training and testing services to automated tools that can be integrated into the software development lifecycle. Cigital is an application security firm specializing in professional and managed services for identifying, remediating and preventing vulnerabilities in software applications, which spun-off Codiscope in 2015 which turned the Cigital tools and intellectual property into a suite of accessible and streamlined tools for a broad population of developers. "Synopsys, Cigital and Codiscope have a shared vision of building security into the software development lifecycle and across the cyber supply chain," said Andreas Kuehlmann, senior vice-president and general manager of the Synopsys Software Integrity Group. "Cigital's consultants are instrumental in guiding organizations from the earliest stages of security readiness and system maturity, which will provide an impactful addition to Synopsys' current product-based offering. Codiscope's developer-focused tools and training modules are important in empowering developers to prioritize security.” John Wyatt, Cigital CEO, added: “We are excited about joining an organization that shares Cigital's vision of securing the software that is at the heart of every organization by building security in. The shared vision of the two companies will provide Cigital the opportunity to accelerate our growth while continuing to deliver consistent, quality services to our clients." "Codiscope's mission of improving the quality of software by creating tools that help developers build and deploy secure code faster is a natural fit in the Synopsys vision of Software Integrity," said Gary Jackson, CEO of Codiscope. “As the velocity of development increases, security belongs in development, and Codiscope will provide Synopsys critical tools to lead the industry." In an email to Infosecurity, Quocirca analyst and director Bob Tarzey said that unlike the acquisition of McAfee by Intel which created the DeepSAFE technology, Cigital/Codiscope is about software security scanning and quality. “This is a big issue with IoT and the other stuff Synopsys develops and sells, so it would seem it sees a benefit in having the capability to test its software in-house,” he said. “Cigital has a service focus based on software security pen-testing and has hundreds of staff, these will be an asset for Synopsys as much as the technology it is acquiring.” Why Not Watch? 6 Nov 2014Shipping Secure Software: Strategy and Tactics for Infosec Managers 2 Jul 2015Protecting Data Across Cloud Applications: the Hidden Challenge 19 Feb 2015Secure Data in the Cloud – Learn to Combat Cyber Threats to Protect Your Assets 17 Dec 2015Ensuring Office 365 Security Related to This Story Interview: Matt Kingswood, ITS Video Interview: John Bruce, CEO & Co-Founder -Resilient, an IBM Company Symantec Name President and COO Would Like to Meet Ping Identity Set to be Acquired by Vista Private Equity What’s Hot on Infosecurity Magazine?

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News eBay’s New Holiday Campaign Captures the Emotion and Excitement of Giving the Perfect Gift National television ads feature the incredible gifts that can only be found on eBay, and inspire shoppers to give thoughtfully this holiday season SAN JOSE, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–eBay (www.ebay.com) today unveils a new holiday campaign, “The Gift They’re Waiting For Is Waiting on eBay,” and debuts television spots on November 9 – marking the brand’s first holiday national television ads in nearly two years. The efforts are part of eBay’s broader holiday mission to help shoppers find perfect gifts for everyone on their list, by offering the best choice and amazing deals all season long. “Our new campaign illustrates why eBay is a top destination for holiday shopping – delivering incredible inventory and inspiration, along with a seamless shopping experience,” said Suzy Deering, Chief Marketing Officer for eBay North America. “As a global marketplace, eBay is the only place to find this year’s most in-demand items, from small and mid-size sellers to top brands like Mattel®, to one-of-a-kind personal or bespoke items. We empower shoppers to be the ultimate gift-givers with our unparalleled selection.” eBay collaborated with the San Francisco-based advertising agency Pereira & O’Dell to develop the new television creative. The marquee spot, titled “The Giver,” takes viewers on the emotional and gratifying journey of finding and giving perfect holiday presents. The marketing campaign also uses digital video, display ads and social media to inspire shoppers looking for unique gift ideas this season. “While the convenience of holiday shopping has increased, the thoughtfulness of gifting has simultaneously decreased,” said PJ Pereira, Chief Creative Officer and Co-founder of Pereira & O’Dell. “The holidays are about spending quality time with family and friends, and the gifts we exchange should reflect these special relationships. eBay is uniquely positioned to help people find perfect gifts for the ones they love, and the new campaign brings this idea to life.” The Gift They’re Waiting For Each year, it becomes increasingly difficult for shoppers to find gifts they truly can’t wait to give. Last year, two-thirds of Americans gave up on their holiday shopping due to a lack of time or inspiration. Even more challenging is that consumers are failing to find great gifts at great prices; 74 percent of Americans surveyed struggled to find deals for the gifts on their shopping lists.1 “In the lead up to this holiday, no single standout gift has emerged, which represents a significant departure from past seasons,” said Hal Lawton, Senior Vice President of eBay North America. “Since shoppers aren’t clamoring for a specific must have item there’s actually more pressure to find perfect gifts. With more than 1 billion listings, only eBay promises unique items and exclusive deals, combined with a cutting edge shopping experience, fast and free delivery, and great service.” Throughout the holidays, eBay will feature some of the most competitive deals on must haves from top brands across electronics, fashion, home and toys: eBay’s Holiday Hub (http://www.ebay.com/holiday) combines gift inspiration with amazing deals and inventory from brands like Mattel® and Sony PlayStation®. Browse and buy the season’s most coveted items – pieces from KENZO x H&M and FENTY x Puma, along with Adidas YEEZY Boosts, an iRobot Roomba, and the Nutri Ninja® – and visit eBay’s Daily Deals page (deals.ebay.com), where 100% of items ship for free. On the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, eBay will host a collection of deals exclusively created for mobile shoppers using the eBay app, making it even easier to shop on-the-go. eBay will also introduce a new feature on the Holiday homepage – a countdown clock – to enable shoppers to track when new deals will be released. All season long, eBay will reveal new gift inspiration and innovative ways to shop, as well as one-of-a-kind experiences through eBay for Charity benefitting a variety of causes. Visit ebay.com/holiday for more information. eBay By the Numbers eBay, Inc. has 165 million active buyers worldwide 81% of all merchandise sold on eBay is new, and our wide selection keeps growing ~87% of items sold on eBay are Buy It Now – no bidding necessary Approximately 1 billion listings at any given time 100% free shipping on all items in Daily Deals About eBay eBay Inc.

China passes new cyber security laws China has brought in new laws that require providers of online messaging and other services to record personal data about users and censor content (TechCrunch). Service providers will be required to record the real names of users when they register, censor "prohibited" content transferred using their services and store data within China's borders. Sophie Richardson, director of Human Rights Watch China, says that the broadly stated law could apply to a surprisingly wide range of companies and that it "will effectively put China’s Internet companies, and hundreds of millions of Internet users, under greater state control."

Samsung's new digital assistant to feature in Galaxy S8 Samsung has confirmed that its forthcoming Galaxy S8 smartphone will feature a new AI-driven digital assistant service to rival Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa (Reuters). The news follows Samsung's October acquisition of Viv Labs, founded by members of the team that first developed Siri. While it's not immediately clear what services will be on offer through Viv, Samsung Executive Vice President Rhee Injong said that "developers can attach and upload services to our agent. Even if Samsung doesn't do anything on its own, the more services that get attached the smarter this agent will get, learn more new services and provide them to end-users with ease." 3. Turkey blocks social media as arrests continue Turkey has once again blocked social media nationwide, coinciding with the latest in a string of arrests of opposition politicians and journalists (Ars Technica). The social media blocks were first reported by the Turkey Blocks monitoring service on Friday. Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp and YouTube have all been affected. 4. Apple cuts the price of USB-C adaptors In response to the furore prompted by the new MacBook Pro's sparse selection of ports, Apple has reduced the price of its adaptors and dongles (BBC). The most broadly useful is a USB-C to USB adaptor, allowing you to connect standard USB devices to the new computers' ports. Previously priced at $19, it's been reduced to $9, as have other connection devices, including a Lightning to USB-C cable required to plug an iPhone into the new laptops. Apple said that "we recognize that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today and they face a transition. We want to help them move to the latest technology and peripherals, as well as accelerate the growth of this new ecosystem."

Samsung's washing machines are 'exploding' Just as the furore around Samsung's 'exploding' Galaxy Note 7s starts to die down, more than 2.8 million of the company's top-loading washing machines are being recalled in North America following injuries, including an alleged broken jaw caused by the tops of the machines coming loose (WIRED). The official recall, by the Consumer Product Safety Commission says: "Samsung has received 733 reports of washing machines experiencing excessive vibration or the top detaching from the washing machine chassis. There are nine related reports of injuries, including a broken jaw, injured shoulder, and other impact or fall-related injuries." It goes on to explain that the recall involves 34 models of Samsung top-load washing machines and lists the model numbers directly affected by the recall.

What makes a song an earworm? A new study published by the American Psychological Association has identified the factors that make a song into an aggressively memorable earworm (Motherboard). Using data from an ongoing survey being run by BBC 6 Music, the University of London and the British Academy, the study found that a successful earworm, such as Lady Gaga's Bad Romance, typically had a fast tempo, "unusual" pitch intervals between notes, used melodies widely found in Western pop music and got a great deal of radio and TV airplay. The most popular earworms in the survey were Bad Romance, Kylie Minogue's aptly named Can't Get You Out of My Head and Don't Stop Believin' by Journey. Kelly Jakubowski of Durham University said that "our findings show that you can, to some extent, predict which songs are going to get stuck in people’s heads based on the song’s melodic content. This could help aspiring song-writers or advertisers write a jingle everyone will remember for days or months afterwards." 8. DeepMind's AI's next challenge: Starcraft II DeepMind, Alphabet's artificial intelligence arm is looking into the possibility of working to train its AIs to play StarCraft because the game provides a comparison to the "messiness of the real-world" (WIRED). The 250-person AI research organisation has teamed-up with StarCraft's creator Blizzard to create an AI-based API that developers can use to improve gameplay. "We’ve worked closely with the StarCraft II team to develop an API that supports something similar to previous bots written with a 'scripted' interface, allowing programmatic control of individual units and access to the full game state," DeepMind said in a blog post. 9. Download a lost Left 4 Dead campaign for free Left 4 Dead developer Turtle Rock Studios has released Dam It, its final, unreleased campaign for the game, as a free download (PC Gamer). Set between Dead Air and Blood Harvest, the level is fully playable, but unfinished, with a few bugs and a missing set piece involving a collapsing bridge. Turtle Rock co-founder Chris Ashton writes that "it's gray box, and some code features are missing, but it's playable from beginning to end. It also includes two standalone survival maps that never shipped." ADVERTISEMENT 10. Video: Intel's latest drone lightshow fleet claims world record Intel has built a 500-strong fleet of drones that world together to fill the sky with dancing light, expanding on the last year's world-recording breaking display by 100 drones (Gizmodo). The new fleet of Shooting Star drones has set a new Guinness World Record for most the Most UAVs airborne simultaneously with a spectacular display that can be directed by a single pilot. The fleet is composed of heavily customised lightweight drones, weighing just 280 grams, "with a soft frame made of flexible plastics and foam and contains no screws."
