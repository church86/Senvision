Chief executive Brian Krzanich announced last year that Intel would spend $300 million to achieve “full representation (of women and minorities) at all levels in our company workforce by 2020.” It’s a lofty goal, and one Intel and other tech companies have struggled to achieve — effectively shutting large segments of the population out from some of the most lucrative careers. But Intel has won plaudits from civil rights activists for setting a goal publicly and providing regular updates on its progress. Before Intel launched its initiative, more than three-quarters of its workers were men and just 8 percent were African-American, Hispanic or Native American. Women now constitute 25.4 percent of Intel’s workforce, up nearly 2 percentage points since December 2014. The total share of underrepresented minorities has increased three-tenths of a percent. Intel indicated the broad restructuring it began last spring — laying off 12,000 workers — has disrupted its diversification effort. And Krzanich said last spring that some of his white, male employees feel “under siege” amid the cutbacks and diversity initiative.

Will this struggling chipmaker break out or spin out over the next 12 months? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Aug 11, 2016 at 2:30PM Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock has bounced between $28 and $35 this year, but its current price represents nearly flat growth from the beginning of the year. That range-bound trading can likely be attributed to the sluggish PC market, weak demand for its data center chips, and its humbling retreat from the mobile market. Image source: Intel. But if we look a year down the road, will these headwinds strengthen or dissipate? Let's discuss analysts' growth forecasts and see where Intel stock might end up in a year. Growth forecasts and price targets Investors should take analysts' price targets with a grain of salt, but it's easy to figure out how these targets are calculated with basic math. Analysts, on average, believe that Intel's earnings per share will rise 7% to $2.50 per share for fiscal 2016. They have an average price target of $37.61 on the stock, which would represent a 9% gain from its price at the time of this writing. If we divide Intel's target price by its estimated EPS, we get an implied P/E ratio of 15. That's lower than Intel's current P/E of 17 and the average P/E of 22 for the broader semiconductor industry. But it's also reasonable to assume that Intel's P/E should pull back, since it's currently at its highest levels of the year. Source: YCharts Therefore, it's safe to assume that Intel stock probably won't post big double-digit gains within the next year. However, we should also examine the key challenges that the company will likely face. Understanding the main challenges Intel could post stronger growth if PC sales start rising again. Unfortunately, IDC expects worldwide PC shipments to fall 7.3% in 2016 and 1.6% in 2017, due to longer-lasting devices, PC owners refusing to upgrade, and the rising use of the smartphone as a main computing device. Microsoft's decision to end free Windows 10 upgrades might persuade some consumers to buy new PCs, but that's a long shot since they weren't willing to install a free OS over the past year. Demand for Intel's data center chips might accelerate and hit the 15% annual sales growth target it set last November. But that growth relies heavily on the Chinese market, where demand is sluggish and cheaper ARM-based servers are gaining more attention. Nvidia and IBM have also been gaining ground in data centers by pairing Nvidia's GPUs with IBM's Power CPUs for machine learning purposes. Due to those challenges, revenue at Intel's Client Computing and Data Center groups, which account for over 80% of its top line, respectively fell 3% and rose just 5% annually last quarter. Intel's discontinuation of mobile chips, which were sold through its Client Computing business, is also a double-edged sword -- it can save billions of dollars by eliminating "contra revenue" subsidies, but it also leaves Intel without a meaningful presence (besides modems) in smartphones. Potential catalysts remain weak Intel constantly highlights new Internet of Things (IoT) markets like drones, wearables, and connected cars as ways to diversify away from PCs and data centers. Unfortunately, Intel's IoT business generated just 4% of its sales and 7% of its operating income last quarter. The unit's revenue rose just 2% annually last quarter, indicating that it won't offset its weak PC and data center growth anytime soon. Other potential areas of growth are programmable chips (acquired from Altera) and non-volatile memory. However, those two businesses generated just 7% of Intel's revenue last quarter, and both units suffered operating losses due to the ongoing decline in flash memory prices. Where will Intel be in a year? Intel's PC and data center businesses will likely keep posting soft numbers over the following year, and its newer businesses will probably struggle to gain momentum. With those challenges in mind, the consensus forecast for 7% earnings growth with a 12-month price target of $38 sounds fairly reasonable. That target isn't impressive, but Intel's valuations are still fairly low, and it pays a solid dividend yield of 3% -- making it a good defensive income play for choppy markets.

Credit: Intel More like this Intel's tablet adventure looking like its netbook disaster Intel's new Atom chips bring 4K video to VR headsets, robots At IDF, Intel is leaving PCs behind to highlight VR and IoT Video Mingis on Tech: From superfast SSDs to Bluetooth locks and solar shingles Intel's Atom chips are on their way out of mobile devices, and the next generation of the chip line will instead be targeted toward drones, self-driving cars, and IoT devices. The new Atom chips will retain the line's focus on low power consumption, with an emphasis on graphics and visual computing. The chip line, to be announced next week at Intel Developer Forum, will be used to maneuver cars, drones, and robots and to also help them recognize objects. Many Atom mobile and server chips have been on Intel's chopping block. The troubled chip's future now is in the growing markets of IoT and virtual reality.  The chips will integrate into devices with the company's 3D RealSense cameras, according to a technical session description at IDF. That points to the chips also being used in low-power virtual reality headsets. Intel will lay out its VR and augmented reality strategy at the developer show, and RealSense is expected to be at the center of many announcements. Intel will show off its own version of Microsoft's HoloLens called Remote EyeSight, a set of head-worn AR smart glasses for remote collaboration. Expect the bread-and-butter products for the new Atom chips to be smart home and industrial IoT devices. The chips, according to the technical session page, will also work in devices with "advanced displays," which could refer to information kiosks or digital advertising displays. Intel declined to comment on the next-generation Atom chips, the details, or the underlying architecture. The chips could be based on the Broxton architecture, conceived by Intel originally as a way to quickly design and release new Atom chips to catch up with market leader ARM in smartphones and tablets. The new chips ensure the survival of the Atom product line, which had an uncertain future. Atom chips for mobile devices were the first on the chopping block after Intel announced plans earlier this year to lay off 12,000 employees and restructure operations to focus on servers, connectivity, IoT, and other areas.  However, Intel is still using Atom chips like Sofia -- which it was supposed to cut -- for point-of-sale systems and industrial IoT devices. The Atom architecture called Goldmont will be used in upcoming Celeron and Pentium PC chips code-named Apollo Lake. Those chips were originally based on the same architecture used in high-end Core PC processors. The new Atom chips could go into AC power-connected devices for digital signs, cash registers, and casino gaming machines, said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research.  "It won't be for small, battery devices," McGregor said. Intel's done a good job of scaling down the size and power consumption for x86 architecture with Atom, but the chip isn't as power efficient as ARM or MIPS for low-power devices, McGregor said. Atom, in a way, is coming back to embedded devices -- which it was originally designed for -- but an ill-advised mobile route has given the chip a bad name, McGregor said. "They have to rebrand it. There's so much failure around it," McGregor said. The Atom chips were at the forefront of the netbook explosion from 2007 to 2010, then were tweaked for tablets and smartphones. Atom smartphones never really took off, and in a desperate move, Intel in 2014 said it would ship 40 million tablet chips, then hit 46 million chips. But by the time Intel found its groove in tablets, that market started declining.

I’m looking at you, Intel. Intel, which last year made a $300 million commitment to foster a diverse and inclusive workplace, released its mid-year diversity report yesterday, and the results are nothing to be proud about. Intel has until 2020 to hit its goal of employing a workforce that is representative of the talent available. But Intel, like most tech companies, is still predominantly white (53%) and male (~75%). Intel’s hiring of underrepresented minorities went up from 11.8% in 2015 to 13.1%, but the caveat is overall URM representation went down from 12.4% to 12.3%. It’s problematic that while the company has increased the rate of hiring underrepresented minorities (people of color), overall representation of POC has gone down at the company. intel diversity mid 2016 Screen Shot 2016-08-11 at 8.27.01 AM  View Slideshow Previous Next Exit This begs the question of why Intel is losing people of color. Intel says it’s related to the workforce restructuring that resulted in layoffs, but my theory is that it has something to do with the fact that not everyone at Intel is on board the diversity and inclusion train. Considering that employees have threatened Intel’s leadership team for its stance on diversity and inclusion, I would imagine that those people are less than welcoming to their diverse co-workers. Related Articles The other pipeline Facebook is slightly less white, but not any darker Rev. Jesse Jackson says Apple is 'setting the pace' around diversity and inclusion “One of the biggest learnings we’ve had this year was that, while there are positive trends in the hiring of underrepresented minorities and our representation of women, we have a ways to go on our journey to making Intel a truly inclusive place,” Intel’s leadership team wrote in the report. “Through data we’ve gathered, conversations we’ve had with employees around the world, and new initiatives we’ve launched, we know we have more work to do to make Intel a place where every employee can bring their full selves to work, and where everyone is heard, valued, and feels they belong.” On the bright side, Intel has added a second woman to its board of directors, electrical engineering professor Dr. Tsu-Jae King Liu. Intel also highlighted its analysis of pay data cross racial identities for the first time, showing a 99% pay equity for URMs. Intel says it hopes to close the pay discrepancy gap by the end of this year.

"One of the biggest learnings we've had this year was that, while there are positive trends in the hiring of underrepresented minorities and our representation of women, we have a ways to go on our journey to making Intel a truly inclusive place," the company said in a midyear report on its diversity initiative. Chief executive Brian Krzanich announced last year that Intel would spend $300 million to achieve "full representation (of women and minorities) at all levels in our company workforce by 2020."  It's a lofty goal, and one Intel and other tech companies have struggled to achieve – effectively shutting large segments of the population out from some of the most lucrative careers. But Intel has won plaudits from civil rights activists for setting a goal publicly and providing regular updates on its progress. Before Intel launched its initiative, more than three-quarters of its workers were men and just 8 percent were African-American, Hispanic or Native American. Women now constitute 25.4 percent of Intel's workforce, up nearly 2 percentage points since December 2014. The total share of underrepresented minorities is flat. Previously, Intel had indicated it was having trouble holding on to underrepresented workers. The company said it has created a "Retention WarmLine" to reach workers who feel they are not progressing in their careers, feel isolated in their jobs or have a bad relationship with their managers. Intel indicated the broad restructuring it began last spring – laying off 12,000 workers across the company – has disrupted its diversification effort. And Krzanich said last spring that some of his white, male employees feel "under siege" amid the cutbacks and diversity initiative. "We will continue our rigor and focus on progression and retention by making the culture and workplace one where everyone feels respected and safe, while also applying the same level of intent and energy engaging our male majority population," the company said in its report. Correction: This article has been corrected to note that Intel has not increased the total share of underrepresented minorities in the past 18 months. The article previously indicated there had been slight growth. -- Mike Rogoway mrogoway@oregonian.com 503-294-7699 @rogoway Inside Silicon Forest About Mike Rogoway Email Mike Rogoway Follow @rogoway Most Read Active Discussions About Us About OregonLive.com Advertise with us Contact the newsroom Frequently Asked Questions Join our team Our Journalists Contact Subscriber Services Subscribe Today The Oregonian Email Newsletters Already a Subscriber Manage your Subscription Delivery Feedback Place a vacation hold Make a payment OregonLive.com Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Living Travel Opinion Obituaries Jobs Autos Real Estate Rentals Classifieds Local Deals Local Businesses Your Regional News Pages Clackamas County Clark County Gresham Portland Washington County More Local News Mobile iPhone, Android apps | Tablet Apps More on OregonLive.com Forums Videos Photos Interact with us Weather Post a job Post a classified ad Sell your car Sell/rent your home Sitemap & search Sponsor Content Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | Google+ | Pinterest | Instagram | Tumblr Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2016 Oregon Live LLC.

Or just Ram and Gpu? - 08-11-2016, 04:00 | posts: 264 | Location: Savannah GA Hey! I have a 2010 Intel i7-860 3.6mhz and a Intel H57 with 5 series 3400 mobo/chipset with 1333mhz 8gb ddr3 Ram, Evga GTX 960 FTW ACX 2.0, PNY 240gb SSD, WD Black Cav 1tb 7200rpm HDD, and a Thermaltake 600w Psu. Should get rid of all of it and start fresh with a Skylake setup and ddr4 or just get some faster ddr3 Ram and a MSI GTX 1060? The reason I can't decide is I use Aida 64 and when run the list of benchmarks with my old i7-860 cpu is in the top 15 in almost every single test ahead of almost every AMD cpu and almost as fast as a i7-965 extreme so it's hard to let go of the old girl since there might be 20 cpu out there faster that's it! Anyway I just realized this Ram is only running at 1066mhz not the advertised 1333mhz so it's got to go but can't decide what else except I regret getting the Evga FTW GTX960 because it's the 2gb version and I only got it cause it was a deal and didn't have to order it so it went home with me the day I bought it. It runs great super cool 70c or under and sooooo quiet with the ACX 2.0 brushless motors but vram is too low and new platforms are blowing it away at less than $300. Help me decide what to do buy a whole new system other than storage and Psu or just Ram and Gpu? OR I am up for any other advice that you pros will share! Thanks! Here is one benchmark result for my old cpu but I removed about 20 results under mine to not use so much space and I get right at 8000 in 3D Mark Fire Strike Free Also faster than 47% of the systems.

Samsung will noch 2016 vor Intel liefern und zeigte diverse Benchmarks. Basierend auf der nicht flüchtigen Speichertechnik 3D Xpoint wollen Intel und Micron SSDs als Optane- und QuantX-Produkte verkaufen. Dieser sogenannte Storage Class Memory, der einerseits die Kapazität von Storage wie HDDs und SSDs liefern und andererseits (fast) die Geschwindigkeit von Arbeitsspeicher erreichen soll, wird von der Industrie als zukunftsweisender Schritt gesehen. Klar, dass da auch Samsung dabei sein will: Die Südkoreaner haben die Z-SSD entwickelt und auf dem Flash Memory Summit vorgestellt. Anzeige Samsungs Z-SSD soll schneller sein als eine mit PRAM. (Foto: Marc Sauter/Golem.de) Die Z-SSD soll noch in diesem Jahr als 1-TByte-Version erscheinen, womit Samsung Intel in die Parade fahren würde. Für 2017 sind Modelle mit 2 und 4 TByte angesetzt. Bei allen handelt es sich um Steckkarten mit schnellem PCIe-3.0-x8-Interface. Ob das NVMe-Protokoll verwendet wird, ist nicht ganz klar, erscheint aber wahrscheinlich. Neben einem neuen Controller nutzen die SSDs sogenannten Z-NAND, der wie der V-NAND v4 aus geschichteten Zellen bestehen soll. Welche Technik Samsung verwendet, bleibt offen - dem Messegeflüster zufolge könnten die Südkoreaner auf Flash mit 1-Bit-Zellen setzen. Auch die Balken sprechen dafür: Verglichen mit der eigenen PM963, einer 2-GB/s-NAND-Flash-SSD, und einem PRAM-Drive (was für Phase Change RAM, ähnlich 3D Xpoint, steht) soll der Z-NAND flotter Daten sequenziell lesen und eine geringere Latenz aufweisen. Zur Schreibrate und Haltbarkeit von Z-NAND äußerte sich Samsung nicht, bei der Energie-Effizienz wurde nur der (schlechter abschneidende) PRAM als Vergleich angegeben. Bei den Benchmarks handelt es sich übrigens um Schätzungen basierend auf Samsungs Emulator. Western Digital wollte erst auf Crosspoint-ReRAM setzen. (Foto: Marc Sauter/Golem.de) Western Digital sagte auf dem Flash Memory Summit, frühere Versuche mit einer Crosspoint-Struktur für Resistive RAM seien wenig erfolgreich gewesen. Der eigene Storage Class Memory werde daher auf geschichteten Speicherzellen basieren, also 3D-ReRAM. Bei resistivem RAM wird eine Dielektrikum-Schicht durch Spannung dazu gebracht, ihren Widerstand zu verändern. Einen Zeitplan für 3D-ReRAM hat Western Digital bisher nicht vorgelegt. 0 3 17 0 zur Startseite Kommentarübersicht So, und jetzt liefert alle mal schön cicero 11.

On Monday, the chipmaker said it had acquired the deep learning startup, making it one of several tech firms increasingly focused on artificial intelligence. By Max Lewontin, Staff August 10, 2016 Save for later Saved Showgoers visit the Intel booth on the first day of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas in January 2013. The chipmaker said Monday it had acquired the deep learning startup Nervana, joining several other tech firms that have increased their focus on artificial intelligence in recent years. Rick Wilking/Reuters/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of With Intel’s acquisition of the deep learning startup Nervana Systems on Monday, the chipmaker is moving further into artificial intelligence, a field that’s become a key focus for tech companies in recent years. Intel’s purchase of the company comes in the wake of Apple’s acquisition of Seattle-based Turi Inc.  last week, while Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Twitter, and Samsung have also made similar deals. Those purchases – large tech firms have bought 31 AI startups since 2011 – according to the research firm CB Insights, also underscore a shift. While AI was once thought of as a sci-fi concept, the technology behind it has come to propel a slew of innovations by hardware and software companies that both attract attention – like self-driving cars – and ones that often go unnoticed, like product recommendations on Amazon. Recommended: Despite sci-fi tropes, robots make better managers, study says “Intel’s acquisition of [Nervana] is an acknowledgment that this area of deep learning, machine learning, artificial intelligence, is really an important part of all companies going forward," says David Schubmehl, an analyst who focuses on the field at the research firm IDC. Despite sci-fi tropes, robots make better managers, study says Photos of the Day Photos of the day 11/23 Intel also purchased Saffron Technologies , which aims to solve complex problems using “cognitive computing,” last fall. But, Mr. Schubmehl tells The Christian Science Monitor, “I think this [recent purchase] is noteworthy because it provides [Intel] with both software and hardware technology.” Nervana’s focus, deep learning, builds on advances in machine learning, the idea of training a computer to “think” and recognize patterns. Deep learning expands so-called neural networks, which are modeled on the human brain, to a much larger scale, allowing a computer to perform tasks such as recognizing an image of a cat without necessarily having prior knowledge of what a cat looked like.  For Intel, which has focused on cloud-based computing systems, machine learning represents a necessary step to contend with the reams of data they generate.  “There is far more data being given off by these machines than people can possibly sift through,” Jason Waxman, an Intel vice president, told Recode. Working with Nervana also offers Intel an opportunity to expand machine learning capabilities in its own chips, rather than simply having software that works on top of them, Recode reports. For many users, these technologies often go unnoticed, Schubmehl notes.  “Do you really spend time thinking about when Amazon says ‘Hey, other people like this product, would you be interested in this product?’” he asks.  “That’s a product of machine learning, but you don’t think of it that way. You just look at as ‘Gee, Amazon actually knows me a little better than other people, and they’re recommending products that I’m actually interested in,’” he adds. In other cases, users have been quick to point to concerns about potential biases hidden in such algorithm-driven technologies. Last year, some complained when they noticed that the first result for a Google search for “female CEO” was a Barbie doll. In June, a video showing that a Google search for “three black teenagers” produced a series of mugshots , in sharp contrast to a search for “three white teenagers,” went viral. Civil libertarians and researchers have also expressed alarm about what happens when such technology is combined with personal data about users, as in tech firm Samsung’s acquisition of the “big data” company Joyent. “I think that a company that is involved in manufacturing devices that people hold so close to their hearts, it behooves them to tread very carefully,” Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, told the Monitor in June. But at this point, many companies' focus on machine learning shows little sign of slowing down, Schubmehl says. For businesses making hardware, whether Intel, the carmaker Tesla, or the power titan GE, the technology offers the ability to integrate their products with software in a variety of ways. Self-driving buses , or robotic manufacturing equipment, he notes, are two of the results. "At some point it will change enterprise software, and technology in general, so that everything is machine learning-enabled in one fashion or another, so it will slow down at that point," he says. "But, I think for the foreseeable future, there’s a lot of what I would call ‘dumb’ software out there that has to be made smart."

Bigelow August 11th, 2016 @bvbigelow @xconomy Like Us Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter LinkedIn Email Reprints On the day after Intel announced its acquisition of San Diego machine learning startup Nervana Systems, investor Steve Jurvetson told me he was feeling a sense of satisfaction about a call he made three years ago, and how it has been playing out. In a 2013 panel discussion at Silicon Valley’s Churchill Club, the DFJ partner said “machine learning” was his pick as the most important tech trend to watch for the next three to five years. “Just about anything you’ve heard [about] at Google that sounds interesting and new is based on machine learning,” Jurvetson said at the time. “Everywhere, technology is starting to percolate into an otherwise prosaic, non-tech industry—apply big data, apply machine learning—and revolutionize it.” Just over a year later, Jurvetson led the Series A round of venture funding for Nervana Systems. Now, more than two years after Nervana was founded, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) has endorsed Jurvetson’s top tech trend of 2013 by acquiring Nervana in a deal reportedly valued at more than $408 million (according to Recode). “It’s not that often in a VC career you get to work with teams you’re sure will be featured in documentaries about how major industries changed,” wrote Matt Ocko of Data Collective Venture Capital, which joined DFJ in Nervana’s initial venture funding. “We can’t wait to see their next set of breakthroughs, delivered at even greater speed, with Intel behind them.” (In the 2-1/2 years since it was founded, Nervana raised roughly $25 million. In addition to DFJ and Data Collective, other investors include Playground Global, CME Ventures, Lux Capital, Allen & Co, AME Cloud Ventures, Fuel Capital, Omidyar Technology Ventures, SV Angel, and unnamed seed investors.) Nervana Systems co-founders (and Qualcomm expats) Naveen Rao, Amir Khosrowshahi, and Arjun Bansal set out to develop new artificial intelligence technology that emulates the human brain, where thousands of synapses transmit information between each neuron. The co-founders integrated their specialized expertise in neuroscience, distributed computing, and networking . As CEO Rao wrote in a blog post Monday, “Nervana started with the idea that we can engineer better solutions for computation by bringing together computer engineering, neuroscience, and machine learning.” Rao added, “With this acquisition, Intel is formally committing to pushing the forefront of AI technologies.” Intel’s Diane Bryant with Nervana’s co-founders Naveen Rao, Arjun Bansal, Amir Khosrowshaki and Intel vice president Jason Waxman (photo courtesy Intel). As Jurvetson drove between meetings yesterday afternoon, he said machine learning continues to be a top tech trend. In a self-described “sweeping generalization,” he declared that the new generation of iterative algorithms in computational mathematics that are being applied in machine learning, directed evolution, and generative design “is the most important advance in engineering since the scientific method.” Nervana initially developed a software-based model of its technology, based on Nvidia graphics processors. Earlier this year, Nervana began offering its AI technology in the cloud to business customers, using a software-as-a-service model. For example, Nervana’s Web-based software has been used to help Paradigm software analyze prospective oil and gas fields, identify irregular trading patterns for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and enable Blue River Technology to refine its computer vision technology for use in agriculture. At the same time, Nervana has been advancing its machine learning technology on a different front by developing a new type of semiconductor architecture based on the company’s neural-based approach to AI. A Nervana “AI semiconductor” would appear to be ideally suited for Intel, as it enables the chipmaker to integrate machine learning into the silicon of Intel’s proprietary chip design—instead of running in the software atop graphics processors made by Nvidia and other chipmakers. In a blog post that recaps the Nervana story, Jurvetson writes that one of the pre-eminent engineers hired by Nervana figured out how to rework the undocumented firmware of Nvidia’s processors to run deep learning algorithms faster than off-the-shelf GPUs “or anything else Facebook could find.” Nervana says the souped-up capabilities of its Neon software framework enable it to run 10 times faster on Nvidia processors—faster even than Nvidia’s own software framework. While speed is always important in computer processing, it becomes especially important in machine learning, which rely on iterative algorithms that allow computers to learn patterns and data without explicit programming instructions. Jurvetson writes that similar innovations in Nervana’s chip design will enable the company’s forthcoming chip to perform 55 trillion operations per second, with multiple high-speed interconnects typically seen in the networking industry making it possible to tie “a matrix of chips together into unprecedented compute fabrics.” Nervana, which now has 48 employees, plans to remain in San Diego and operate under its own brand name. Combining Nervana’s expertise in artificial intelligence with Intel’s capabilities, technology resources, and huge market reach, Rao wrote, “will allow us to realize our vision and create something truly special.” Nervana Systems co-founders (from left) Arjun Bansal, Amir Khosrowshahi, and Naveen Rao.

Colin Johnson, EETimes 8/10/2016 08:47 PM EDT LAKE WALES, Fla.—Intel will announce its intention to acquire Nervana Systems at its Intel Developer Forum next week (IDF 2016, San Francisco, Calif., August 16-to-18)—a bid to obsolete the graphics processor unit (GPU) for deep learning artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Intel dominates the high-performance computing (HPC) market, but Nvidia has made significant inroads into deep learning verticals with its sophisticated GPUs. However, Nervana Systems (Palo Alto, Calif.) has already made a significant dent in Nvidia's Cuda software for its GPUs with Nervana's Neon cloud service that is Cuda-compatible. Intel, however, is acquiring Nervana for its promised deep-learning accelerator chip, which it promises by 2017. If the chip plays out as advertised, Intel will sell Deep Learning accelerator hardware boards that beat Nvidia's GPU boards, while its newly acquired Neon cloud service will outperform Nvidia's Cuda software.

On Monday, the chipmaker said it had acquired the deep learning startup, making it one of several tech firms increasingly focused on artificial intelligence. By Max Lewontin, Staff August 10, 2016 Save for later Saved Showgoers visit the Intel booth on the first day of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas in January 2013. The chipmaker said Monday it had acquired the deep learning startup Nervana, joining several other tech firms that have increased their focus on artificial intelligence in recent years. Rick Wilking/Reuters/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of With Intel’s acquisition of the deep learning startup Nervana Systems on Monday, the chipmaker is moving further into artificial intelligence, a field that’s become a key focus for tech companies in recent years. Intel’s purchase of the company comes in the wake of Apple’s acquisition of Seattle-based Turi Inc.  last week, while Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Twitter, and Samsung have also made similar deals. Those purchases – large tech firms have bought 31 AI startups since 2011 – according to the research firm CB Insights, also underscore a shift. While AI was once thought of as a sci-fi concept, the technology behind it has come to propel a slew of innovations by hardware and software companies that both attract attention – like self-driving cars – and ones that often go unnoticed, like product recommendations on Amazon. Recommended: Despite sci-fi tropes, robots make better managers, study says “Intel’s acquisition of [Nervana] is an acknowledgment that this area of deep learning, machine learning, artificial intelligence, is really an important part of all companies going forward," says David Schubmehl, an analyst who focuses on the field at the research firm IDC. Despite sci-fi tropes, robots make better managers, study says Photos of the Day Photos of the day 11/23 Intel also purchased Saffron Technologies , which aims to solve complex problems using “cognitive computing,” last fall. But, Mr. Schubmehl tells The Christian Science Monitor, “I think this [recent purchase] is noteworthy because it provides [Intel] with both software and hardware technology.” Nervana’s focus, deep learning, builds on advances in machine learning, the idea of training a computer to “think” and recognize patterns. Deep learning expands so-called neural networks, which are modeled on the human brain, to a much larger scale, allowing a computer to perform tasks such as recognizing an image of a cat without necessarily having prior knowledge of what a cat looked like.  For Intel, which has focused on cloud-based computing systems, machine learning represents a necessary step to contend with the reams of data they generate.  “There is far more data being given off by these machines than people can possibly sift through,” Jason Waxman, an Intel vice president, told Recode. Working with Nervana also offers Intel an opportunity to expand machine learning capabilities in its own chips, rather than simply having software that works on top of them, Recode reports. For many users, these technologies often go unnoticed, Schubmehl notes.  “Do you really spend time thinking about when Amazon says ‘Hey, other people like this product, would you be interested in this product?’” he asks.  “That’s a product of machine learning, but you don’t think of it that way. You just look at as ‘Gee, Amazon actually knows me a little better than other people, and they’re recommending products that I’m actually interested in,’” he adds. In other cases, users have been quick to point to concerns about potential biases hidden in such algorithm-driven technologies. Last year, some complained when they noticed that the first result for a Google search for “female CEO” was a Barbie doll. In June, a video showing that a Google search for “three black teenagers” produced a series of mugshots , in sharp contrast to a search for “three white teenagers,” went viral. Civil libertarians and researchers have also expressed alarm about what happens when such technology is combined with personal data about users, as in tech firm Samsung’s acquisition of the “big data” company Joyent. “I think that a company that is involved in manufacturing devices that people hold so close to their hearts, it behooves them to tread very carefully,” Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, told the Monitor in June. But at this point, many companies' focus on machine learning shows little sign of slowing down, Schubmehl says. For businesses making hardware, whether Intel, the carmaker Tesla, or the power titan GE, the technology offers the ability to integrate their products with software in a variety of ways. Self-driving buses , or robotic manufacturing equipment, he notes, are two of the results. "At some point it will change enterprise software, and technology in general, so that everything is machine learning-enabled in one fashion or another, so it will slow down at that point," he says. "But, I think for the foreseeable future, there’s a lot of what I would call ‘dumb’ software out there that has to be made smart."

Clear Linux Continues To Have Graphics Performance Advantage Over Ubuntu Written by Michael Larabel in Operating Systems on 11 August 2016. Page 1 of 3. 21 Comments Earlier this week I published some Windows 10 vs. Ubuntu Linux OpenGL benchmarks showing how the native gaming performance is different between the competing platforms. Ubuntu Linux lost nearly all of those results with the Intel Mesa driver to Windows 10. In this article are those previous benchmarks plus now having Intel Clear Linux benchmarks added in the mix. Months ago in previous tests we've found Clear Linux to have faster Linux graphics performance than other distributions. Clear Linux 9810 was used for benchmarking and was powered by the Linux 4.7 kernel and Mesa 12.0. Ubuntu 16.04 was tested out-of-the-box with Linux 4.4 and Mesa 11.2 while also testing Ubuntu 16.04 when upgraded to Linux 4.7 and Mesa 12.1-dev Git. Windows 10 was using the latest proprietary Intel graphics driver. The same Intel Core i5 6600K system was used accross testing. If you're new here, the reason why in the system table the CPU frequency is different just comes down to the different distributions using different CPU scaling drivers reporting base vs. turbo frequency, etc. Same goes for any other hardware reported differences: the same system was used during testing. In the earlier aforelinked Windows vs. Ubuntu testing, various Steam games were also tested in addition to the various tests exposed by the Phoronix Test Suite. However, Clear Linux doesn't yet support Steam: there's a mess of 32-bit libraries not packaged by the distribution. Hopefully Valve will migrate the Steam Linux client to being pure 64-bit soon enough, but for now at least there isn't the ability to run Steam games on Clear Linux. For those new to Clear Linux, it's also worth mentioning that only Intel graphics are supported with the Nouveau and Radeon DRM drivers being deactivated. Anyhow, for those curious how Clear Linux with its latest packages are comparing to Ubuntu 16.04 and Windows 10, the latest numbers are on the pages ahead.

Representational image. Reuters According to a report by India Today, the BBMP has come up with a very unique method to extract the dues. It has decided to teach the employees of the IT company to love a stinky office if the IT giant fails to pay its taxes. The Intel employees were greeted by a pile of garbage when they reached their office. The BBMP officials had blocked the gates of the firm’s premises in Belandur with trucks filled with garbage, the India Today report added. The Hindu quoted sources as saying that some officials even threatened to dump the garbage inside the office if the company did not pay up property tax dues to the civic body. The standing committee on taxation and finance found that Intel had defaulted tax payment between 2007 and 2008 of around Rs 34 crore. Intel challenged this in court. However, after valid documentation, the BBMP managed to convince the court how Intel defaulted, according to reports. Intel ignored several court warnings to pay half of the due amount by 25 July. India Today quoted the Joint Commissioner of the Mahadevapura zone, BBMP, Muniveerappa as saying that the company had been calculating its taxes on the basis that it was not an air conditioned office, but the reality was that it was centrally air conditioned. He also said that after Intel authorities gave a written undertaking that they would pay half of the dues by 28 August, the garbage trucks were removed from the office gate. Apart from BBMP, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) too has come up with innovative ways to make defaulters pay their dues. According to its recent notice, the BMC will now seize movable property such as computers, furniture, sofas, televisions, refrigerators, air-conditioners and other valuables if they don’t pay up by the due date, reported The Indian Express. It also plans on sealing the lifts, building material and entrance of the building to restrict its usage to recover the property tax due on land, according to the policy.

(Photo: Remy Gabalda, AFP Getty Images) SAN FRANCISCO — Intel has committed $300 million to ensure that by 2020 its staff mirrors what it calls the market availability of the U.S. tech workforce. But even that kind of cash doesn't buy overnight success. In the tech company's latest mid-year diversity report released Wednesday, most of Intel's key metrics remained flat or ticked up slightly despite concerted efforts in the past six months to target women and minorities in the hiring process. "One of the biggest learnings we’ve had this year was that, while there are positive trends in the hiring of underrepresented minorities and our representation of women, we have a ways to go on our journey to making Intel a truly inclusive place," read a note accompanying the report, which was signed by CEO Brian Krzanich, Diversity and Inclusion chief Aisha Evans and Human Resources leader Danielle Brown. Currently, Intel is 53% white and 32% Asian, a skew that is generally reflective of tech companies - from Google and Apple to small startups — as they continue to grapple with the challenge of creating a workforce that better reflects the U.S. population. USA TODAY EEOC to hold rare public hearing on tech diversity While tech firm leaders long resisted revealing the overwhelmingly white and male make-up of their work force, pressure from both media outlets and activist groups such as Rev. Jesse Jackson's Rainbow PUSH Coalition have since made reporting diversity efforts almost de rigueur as prospective employees look for companies that reflect their own values. Achieving workplace diversity also goes beyond social justice or mere optics, as many researchers have noted that a diverse workforce typically correlates to increased corporate performance as employees are better able to anticipate the needs of a broad consumer base. Many companies now have diversity on their front burner, dedicating resources to in-house diversity programs and nontraditional outreach programs in efforts that often are led by senior leaders focusing solely on diversity and inclusion. But despite this new-found emphasis, progress is slow. In a report last month, Facebook revealed that its employee makeup has changed little over the past years despite the social media giant's intent on looking less homogeneous. Apple was the latest tech company to update its diversity numbers. Last week, the Cupertino, Calif.-based iPhone-maker revealed that its non-white workforce grew by a percentage point, although white employees also increased by 2% to 56%. African-American employees went from 8% to 9%, Hispanics from 11% to 12% and Asians from 18% to 19%. USA TODAY Few minorities in non-tech jobs in Silicon Valley, USA TODAY finds Among the key findings in Intel's latest report: female employees inched up to 25.4% from 24.8% in December 2015, while underrepresented minorities (URMs) decreased slightly to 12.3% from 12.4%. Among URMs, African-American staffing increased to 3.7% from 3.5%, while Hispanics dropped to 8% from 8.4%. The U.S. workforce currently consists of 58% women, 16% Hispanics and 12% African-Americans, according to the Department of Labor. On the hiring front, Intel's efforts remained flat with women and minorities accounting for 43.4% of all hires, compared to 43.1% in December. Of that 43.4%, 13.1% were URMs, a notable jump from the 9% figure logged in December 2014. The company also said it was at 99% pay equity for URMs. Gender pay equity is at 100%. USA TODAY Intel diversity stats show slow pace of progress Women in senior company positions grew to 18.2% from 16.5% six months ago, while those in leadership positions also increased slightly to 18.7% from 17.6%. URM representation in senior positions inched up to 6.4% from 5.8%, while those in leadership roles hit 6.9% from 6.3%. Intel also announced it had added a second woman to its board of directors, University of California at Berkeley electrical engineering professor Tsu-Jae King Liu. The company also noted a need to improve its retention efforts, as adding new women and minorities to the payroll can easily be offset by departing employees who don't find the environment welcoming. Intel also is grappling with a challenging business market, as it looks to reinvent itself from a chip-maker to a provider of cloud-based services powering Internet of Things devices. In April, Intel announced it would be laying off 12,000 employees, or about 11% of its global workforce.

Photo: Bloomberg San Francisco: Tech-giant Intel on Wednesday acquired California-based deep learning start-up Nervana Systems run by an Indian-origin entrepreneur, allowing the chip maker to foray into the world of artificial intelligence. Co-founded by Naveen Rao in 2014 and headquartered in San Diego, California, Nervana has a fully-optimised software and hardware stack for deep learning. The US-based chip giant isn’t actually saying how much it is paying, but a source with knowledge of the deal said it is valued at around $408 million, Recode, a technology news website that focuses on the business of Silicon Valley reported. “Today, Iam excited to announce that Intel signed a definitive agreement to acquire Nervana Systems, a recognised leader in deep learning,” Diane Bryant, executive vice president of Data Center Group at Intel said. “We will share more about artificial intelligence (AI) and the amazing experiences it enables at our Intel Developer Forum next week,” Bryant said. “Their IP and expertise in accelerating deep learning algorithms will expand Intel’s capabilities in the field of Artificial Intelligence. We will apply Nervana’s software expertise to further optimise the Intel Math Kernel Library and its integration into industry standard frameworks,” she said. “Nervana’s Engine and silicon expertise will advance Intel’s AI portfolio and enhance the deep learning performance and TCO of our Intel Xeon and Intel Xeon Phi processors,” she added. “We believe that bringing together the Intel engineers who create the Intel Xeon and Intel Xeon Phi processors with the talented Nervana Systems’ team, we will be able to advance the industry faster than would have otherwise been possible. We will continue to invest in leading edge technologies that complement and enhance Intel’s AI portfolio,” Bryant said. “We’ve always been a mission driven company. Even though we won’t be a startup any longer, our mission hasn’t changed. we are here to make a dent in the world of computation, Rao said. “With this deal, we can now shatter the old paradigm and move into a new regime of computing. We’ll look back in 10 years and see this time as the inflection point of when compute architectures became neural,” he said. According to Rao, the semiconductor integrated circuit is one of humanity’s crowning achievements and Intel has the best semiconductor technology in the world. Nervana’s AI expertise combined with Intel’s capabilities and huge market reach will allow us to realise our vision and create something truly special, Rao said. He said that the deal didn’t reflect any hurdles in getting more capital to stay independent. “Raising money was not the problem. That was going to be relatively easy. But by selling to Intel, we have access to technology we’d never dream about,” Rao was quoted as saying Recode. Intel is one of the world’s largest and highest valued semiconductor chip makers, based on revenue.

The companies did not disclose terms of their deal, but online tech journal Recode pegged the transaction at more than $350 million. Founded by former Qualcomm researcher Naveen Rao, Nervana aims to apply “neural network learning” to computers. Machine learning gives computers a humanlike ability to improve their performance over time by observing results and adjusting their actions in response. Artificial intelligence can solve arcane computing problems or for practical applications like determining which kind of shampoo an online shopper is most likely to buy. It’s a hot sector in computing, with Nvidia, Google and others designing chips to serve the market. Intel’s PC business, which makes up most of its revenue, is fading rapidly. But the company’s data center group is thriving, and the computational power inside server farms meshes neatly with the demands of machine learning. “We believe that bringing together the Intel engineers who create the Intel Xeon and Intel Xeon Phi processors with the talented Nervana Systems’ team, we will be able to advance the industry faster than would have otherwise been possible,” wrote Diane Bryant, Intel’s data center chief, in an online posting announcing the deal.

(Photo: Remy Gabalda, AFP Getty Images) SAN FRANCISCO — Intel has committed $300 million to ensure that by 2020 its staff mirrors what it calls the market availability of the U.S. tech workforce. But even that kind of cash doesn't buy overnight success. In the tech company's latest mid-year diversity report released Wednesday, most of Intel's key metrics remained flat or ticked up slightly despite concerted efforts in the past six months to target women and minorities in the hiring process. "One of the biggest learnings we’ve had this year was that, while there are positive trends in the hiring of underrepresented minorities and our representation of women, we have a ways to go on our journey to making Intel a truly inclusive place," read a note accompanying the report, which was signed by CEO Brian Krzanich, Diversity and Inclusion chief Aisha Evans and Human Resources leader Danielle Brown. Currently, Intel is 53% white and 32% Asian, a skew that is generally reflective of tech companies - from Google and Apple to small startups — as they continue to grapple with the challenge of creating a workforce that better reflects the U.S. population. USA TODAY EEOC to hold rare public hearing on tech diversity While tech firm leaders long resisted revealing the overwhelmingly white and male make-up of their work force, pressure from both media outlets and activist groups such as Rev. Jesse Jackson's Rainbow PUSH Coalition have since made reporting diversity efforts almost de rigueur as prospective employees look for companies that reflect their own values. Achieving workplace diversity also goes beyond social justice or mere optics, as many researchers have noted that a diverse workforce typically correlates to increased corporate performance as employees are better able to anticipate the needs of a broad consumer base. Many companies now have diversity on their front burner, dedicating resources to in-house diversity programs and nontraditional outreach programs in efforts that often are led by senior leaders focusing solely on diversity and inclusion. But despite this new-found emphasis, progress is slow. In a report last month, Facebook revealed that its employee makeup has changed little over the past years despite the social media giant's intent on looking less homogeneous. Apple was the latest tech company to update its diversity numbers. Last week, the Cupertino, Calif.-based iPhone-maker revealed that its non-white workforce grew by a percentage point, although white employees also increased by 2% to 56%. African-American employees went from 8% to 9%, Hispanics from 11% to 12% and Asians from 18% to 19%. USA TODAY Few minorities in non-tech jobs in Silicon Valley, USA TODAY finds Among the key findings in Intel's latest report: female employees inched up to 25.4% from 24.8% in December 2015, while underrepresented minorities (URMs) decreased slightly to 12.3% from 12.4%. Among URMs, African-American staffing increased to 3.7% from 3.5%, while Hispanics dropped to 8% from 8.4%. The U.S. workforce currently consists of 58% women, 16% Hispanics and 12% African-Americans, according to the Department of Labor. On the hiring front, Intel's efforts remained flat with women and minorities accounting for 43.4% of all hires, compared to 43.1% in December. Of that 43.4%, 13.1% were URMs, a notable jump from the 9% figure logged in December 2014. The company also said it was at 99% pay equity for URMs. Gender pay equity is at 100%. USA TODAY Intel diversity stats show slow pace of progress Women in senior company positions grew to 18.2% from 16.5% six months ago, while those in leadership positions also increased slightly to 18.7% from 17.6%. URM representation in senior positions inched up to 6.4% from 5.8%, while those in leadership roles hit 6.9% from 6.3%. Intel also announced it had added a second woman to its board of directors, University of California at Berkeley electrical engineering professor Tsu-Jae King Liu. The company also noted a need to improve its retention efforts, as adding new women and minorities to the payroll can easily be offset by departing employees who don't find the environment welcoming. Intel also is grappling with a challenging business market, as it looks to reinvent itself from a chip-maker to a provider of cloud-based services powering Internet of Things devices. In April, Intel announced it would be laying off 12,000 employees, or about 11% of its global workforce.

Getty Images Advertisement Intel Corp. (IW 500/20),  which makes chips that run more than 90% of the world’s servers, said it’s buying startup Nervana Systems to add software, a cloud service and future hardware in an attempt to better tune its products for artificial intelligence work. While Intel’s Xeon processors dominate in data centers, they’re not built for the unique workloads of artificial intelligence calculations, according to Gartner Inc. analyst Martin Reynolds. Adding Nervana’s products and expertise will help it gain a foothold in a small but growing market and fend off would-be rivals such as Nvidia Inc., if it can rapidly turn its acquisition into products. “The market isn’t that big yet,” he said. “But it’s potentially a huge opportunity.” Intel’s data center unit, its most-profitable and fastest-growing business, needs to find products suited to running emerging services such as voice and picture recognition. Such artificial intelligence work is expected to become a bigger portion of the activity of the servers powered by Intel’s chips. “We believe that bringing together the Intel engineers who create the Intel Xeon and Intel Xeon Phi processors with the talented Nervana Systems’ team, we will be able to advance the industry faster than would have otherwise been possible,” Intel’s Diane Bryant, executive vice president of its data center business, said in a web posting. “We will continue to invest in leading edge technologies that complement and enhance Intel’s AI portfolio.” San Diego-based Nervana was founded in 2014. Terms of the acquisition weren’t disclosed.

Skip to content twitter facebook arisbox.com Latest digital, social media, business, tech, entertainment and mobile news Primary Menu Home News Apple Microsoft Google Facebook Twitter Software Apps iOS tvOS Cydia Android Windows Mobile Gadgets Gamers Playstation Xbox Arcade Movies About Search Search for: Gamers, Gaming, News, Products, Windows Review | Digital Storm Aura, the killer all-in-one PC All-in-one (AIO) desktop computers are a ubiquitous sighting in any computer superstore, actual or virtual. One of the most popular and iconic is Apple’s 5K-screened iMac $1,899.00 at Amazon, which always seems to occupy a spot at the top of our ratings charts. On the Windows-PC side, we’ve seen lots of models of late with slick designs, such as Lenovo’s Ideacentre AIO 700 $1,379.00 at Amazon. But those are mainstream models, with silicon guts that are meant for casual and multimedia use. For gamers, the AIO selection is a lot less robust. MSI’s Gaming 27 6QE $2,499.99 at Amazon is one of the few game-capable models that recently passed through our hands. One of the most potent AIOs we’ve ever tested, it packed a desktop-grade Intel Core i7-6700 quad-core processor and Nvidia GeForce GTX 980M graphics. We considered it mighty fast for an AIO, but its notebook-class graphics processor isn’t upgradable. And while a GeForce GTX 980M is no slouch, it is well short of the performance tier offered by desktop-class cards in traditional mid-ATX towers and some small form factor (SFF) systems. So what happens when you want an AIO with desktop graphics and upgradability? Your options have generally involved rocks and hard places, but Digital Storm is changing that with its new Aura AIO. The big differentiating point for this model isn’t its stunningly curved 34-inch WQHD (3,440×1,440-pixel) display, though it certainly is the most obvious attraction. (We’ve seen one like it in HP’s equally mesmerizing Envy 34 Curved All-in-One $1,899.99 at HP.) What’s game-changing about the Aura is the fact it uses standard desktop-PC components, not laptop-style mobile ones. Our $3,389 review unit included an Intel Core i7-6700K quad-core processor (overclocked to 4.4GHz), and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Founders Edition graphics card. Both were connected on the back side of the monitor via a Gigabyte Z170N Mini-ITX motherboard, along with 16GB of DDR4-3000 RAM, a 512GB Samsung SSD 950 Pro solid-state drive, and a 1TB hard drive. The Aura’s back view, with its access panel removed, is almost as impressive as its huge display. In essence, this is a giant-screened AIO with all the power of an SFF desktop built in. The Aura still has limitations next to a traditional desktop, namely in storage. But for AIO gaming, this is the height of luxury. Let’s take a deeper dive. Design To the casual eye, the Digital Storm Aura looks like a big 34-inch monitor. A passerby might easily mistake it for just that, without realizing there’s a high-powered desktop integrated in the back. The unit’s curvature and sheer size make it an impressive sight. It measures 33 inches wide, 18 inches tall, and 4 inches deep. It rests on a heavy-duty, all-metal forked display stand, which connects midway up the rear and offers a small range of tilt adjustment. The Aura also includes a VESA mount, should you decide to go aftermarket and put it on a wall. (Use a stud finder, for sure!) The whole setup is quite heavy, ranging between 45 and 55 pounds depending on the loadout. It’s quite unwieldy to move about. The exterior construction is predominantly plastic, though the display stand, its connection point, and some of the internals are metal. The plastics used on the back made a relatively hollow sound when we tapped it with a fingernail, but those around the display itself were solid. The Aura’s backside has ventilation holes over strategic areas, notably the graphics card and the motherboard. The top of the unit is perforated the entire way across, much like a TV. To turn the unit on, press the power button under the right side of the display. A display-menu option button is to its immediate left. A faint blue light shines directly under the power button when the unit is running. A stubby Webcam sticks out the top of the Aura, connected via the sole USB Type-A 3.0 port residing there… It has usable quality for casual video chats. It can be disconnected, should you wish to use the port for something else. Features The 34-inch display is the Aura’s key selling point. Needless to say, it’s gigantic. It positively dwarfs typical 24- and even 27-inch desktop monitors. Its 21:9 aspect ratio also makes it much more elongated than the 16:9 aspect ratios of most computer displays. Video content on YouTube, Netflix, and elsewhere is generally formatted for 16:9, instead of 21:9. As a result, videos may show with a black border around the edges, simply because they don’t go wide enough. It doesn’t compromise the media quality, but just realize that not everything will make use of a screen this wide. As if the size and aspect ratio weren’t crazy enough, the whole display is curved. If you haven’t used a curved screen this big before, it’s quite the experience. The curvature adds to the immersive feeling in games, since it literally wraps the picture around the edges of your vision. The same goes for movies and pictures. The picture quality is stunning. According to Digital Storm, it’s an IPS panel with nearly unlimited viewing angles. It appears as bright as most high-end TVs, with a brightness range of 280 to 350cd/m. The high contrast, coupled with the 99 percent sRGB gamut coverage, equates to a lively image in just about any situation. For productivity purposes, there are highly practical advantages to a display like this. The extra-wide WQHD (3,440×1,440-pixel) resolution means you can stack three, four, or even five windows side-by-side with minimal resizing. A standard FHD (1,920×1,080) display would generally allow for only two windows side-by-side. In essence, this single display is like having multiple displays, except it’s one seamless panel. Thanks to the size of the monitor, we were able to see text and icons in Windows just fine without having to use its scaling feature to magnify everything. As we’ll see in the benchmarking section, graphics horsepower is very important for driving today’s games at the Aura’s sky-high resolution. All we can complain about on this display is its lack ofNvidia G-Sync support, which could help smooth out the gaming experience even more. We were expecting the Aura to include a more usable set of speakers, though. They’re rearward-facing, located in the upper corners behind the display panel. The sound performance is on the underwhelming side, with little bass and a compressed sound stage. The volume is lacking, too, not much better than a notebook with decent-quality speakers. Port selection isn’t something the Aura lacks on paper, but does in practical fact. There are no front-mounted ports at all. Behind the back right side of the panel are two USB Type-A 3.0 ports, separate headphone and microphone jacks, and the full-size SD/MMC card reader… The remaining ports face out the underside of the Aura, where the back of the motherboard is aimed… As you can see, these ports are implemented through a standard PC I/O shield. Problem is, there seemed to be no safe or practical way to tilt the Aura forward or backward on its stand enough to ease the access to these ports. We moreover found it all but impossible to identify the ports by feel, and didn’t dare try to plug something in blind. The only way to connect something underneath here was to disconnect the Aura from its stand, then wrestle the nearly 50-pound unit onto its face. You’ll want to do that exactly once! Access to the ports is otherwise unobstructed. This situation has the potential to improve if you use a VESA mount, depending on where you mount the unit and the amount of adjustment allowed by the aftermarket hardware. But you’ll want to use these ports for more or less permanent connections, such as those for keyboards and mice. The Aura’s Gigabyte Z170N-Gaming 5 motherboard offered respectable connectivity through this panel. At its upper left is a legacy PS/2 port, with two USB Type-A 3.0 ports underneath. The wireless antenna connectors are to its right. The antenna unit was included (not shown in most of our pictures), and it was required to achieve wireless range beyond a few feet. (Just remember to connect them before you mount the Aura in its stand!) Under and to the right of the wireless antenna connectors were two inactive video-outs: legacy DVI-D, and HDMI. (They were inactive because a dedicated graphics card was installed.) To the right of the HDMI port was one USB Type-C 3.1 (no Thunderbolt 3 support on that). Further right was Gigabit Ethernet, the last USB Type-A 3.0, a USB Type-A 3.1, and a cluster of audio ports (S/PDIF, line-in, headphone, mic, and surround jacks). The GTX 1080 Founders Edition graphics card in our review unit had DVI, HDMI, and three DisplayPorts. All were blocked off by rubber stoppers, or otherwise made inaccessible by a right-angle HDMI connector hooked into the display unit itself, via a physical HDMI-in… It’s an uncanny situation. You probably could connect another, external monitor to the Aura if youwanted, but we didn’t try. The Aura’s power connector is horizontal, located to the left of the motherboard… Like with the other bottom-mounted ports, we found it quite difficult to connect a power cable without taking the Aura off its stand. Take our word for it: connect everything you want to connect to those bottom ports before you mount the Aura on its stand. Component Access Getting to the Aura’s internals means first dismounting it from its stand, and laying it face-down. The stand arm comes out with two screws. Ten more hold in the one-piece back plastic panel. It did take a bit of gentle fingernail prying to nudge the whole piece loose. You’ll want to disconnect the slim 120mm exhaust fan attached to the plastic panel prior to fully lifting it away. The Aura’s exposed backside is an impressive sight. All of the components are carefully placed, and no bit of space is wasted… The speakers reside at the upper corners… The CPU liquid cooling unit, radiator, and cylindrical fan unit all sit at the upper left… The server-style power supply takes care of powering the computer itself, while the power brick to its left (blissfully, integrated into the unit) powers the display… To the right of the motherboard is the graphics card, connected via a PCI Express x16 ribbon extender… Removing the graphics card entails taking off a thumbscrew holding it in via a bracket on its aft end. To the right of the graphics card is a 2.5-inch drive bay. Two drives can fit here, one atop the other. Our review unit had a single mechanical hard drive… Putting back the rear plastic panel required a bit of finesse. You’ll need to fit the panel by hand, ensuring it’s snug on all sides. The five bottom screws go in easily, but the five along the top require intense eyeballing to line up with their holes. Then, it’s a matter of wrestling the Aura back onto its display stand (or VESA mount). An M.2 slot is on the motherboard, holding the boot drive, the Samsung SSD 950 Pro we mentioned earlier on. But we weren’t able to tell that from looking at the top of the board. The slot is on the underside, meaning complete removal of the motherboard is required to access it. That’s far from a five-minute task. Fortunately, the Samsung SSD 950 Pro in our Aura was 512GB, which should be roomy enough for some time, and is one of the fastest consumer drives available, thanks to its support of the NVMe protocol. You’d be hard-pressed to improve on it. Components The almost-top-tier Aura we’re reviewing had a loadout summing up to $3,389 at the time of this review. The 34-inch display is the same across models, so the differences mostly lie in the internal components. The heart of our Aura is Intel’s flagship quad-core, the Core i7-6700K. It was overclocked to 4.4GHz (8-44x multiplier), and connected to Digital Storm’s Vortex liquid cooler. The overclocking was $49 extra. Considering the “K” series processors are unlocked, you could do the overclocking yourself. The BIOS of our unit’s Gigabyte Z170N-Gaming 5 Mini-ITX motherboard was fully unlocked. 4.4GHz is a respectable number, considering the base Core i7-6700K runs at 4GHz even. Digital Storm also offered the Aura with Intel X99-based motherboards for Broadwell-E support, in case you want a processor with more than four cores, such as the eight-core/16-thread Core i7-6900K, or even the wildly expensive 10-core/20-thread Core i7-6950X Extreme Edition$1,649.99 at Amazon. For gaming, though, the Core i7-6700K in our review unit is the best all-around choice. The processors with six cores or more may actually have worse performance for gaming, since their cores typically run at lesser frequencies next to the quad-core. The Aura accepts one double-wide, standard length PCI Express x16 graphics card. As mentioned, the slot was populated in our review unit by Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1080 Founders Edition, the fastest single card available as of early August 2016 beside, perhaps, the just-announced Nvidia Titan X… Digital Storm offered Nvidia cards starting with the relatively anemic GeForce GTX 950$144.99 at Amazon. Given the 34-inch display panel’s 3,440×1,440-pixel resolution, which has 60 percent of the pixels of a 4K (3,840×2,160) display, the very minimum card you’d want for gaming is an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060. Given that even the GTX 1080 in our review unit wasn’t hitting 60fps in some games at this resolution, we’d strongly recommend at least a GeForce GTX 1070 for a bit of future-proofing. (Digital Storm didn’t offer AMD cards in the Aura as of this writing, such as the new Radeon RX 480$299.99 at Amazon or older Fury-series cards.) Mini-ITX motherboards are all that fit in the Aura, though we’re not necessarily calling that a fault. The Gigabyte Z170N-Gaming 5 Mini-ITX model in our review unit had two DIMM slots for desktop DDR4 memory. They were occupied with two 8GB modules of wicked fast DDR4-3000. The maximum amount supported is 32GB, via a 2x 16GB-DIMM configuration. (A standard full-ATX motherboard in a typical desktop would have four or more slots.) For storage, the Aura has that single (and hidden) M.2 PCI Express slot and two 2.5-inch drive bays. As we noted, the M.2 slot is on the underside of the motherboard, making upgrades complicated and time-consuming.  In our review unit, one of the two bays in the 2.5-inch drive cage was populated with a Hitachi 1TB 7,200rpm drive. The 2.5-inch form factor currently limits you to 2TB hard drives. Even SFF desktops tend to have at least one 3.5-inch bay, so being restricted to 2.5-inch drives is a little disappointing. (That’s because 3.5-inch drives can be found in up to 10TB capacities.) Both electronic and physical space are at a premium in the Aura, so you may be looking at the external, network, or cloud route to get more. Digital Storm’s base Aura config was listed for $2,272, as of this writing, which included a fairly robust amount of power. That price netted a Core i7-6700 (non-K/non-overclockable) processor, Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 graphics, 16GB of DDR4-2666 RAM, and a 1TB hard drive. You could actually knock the price lower by selecting lesser components if you wanted. Bumping the graphics to a more capable GeForce GTX 1070 in the base configuration pushed it to $2,640. No matter how we configured it, the Aura always seemed to be right at or north of $2,500 for a setup capable of playing the latest AAA games at the 34-inch display’s native resolution. Airflow In traditional desktop design, air generally gets drawn in through the front, then pushed out the back or sides. The thermal playground is a bit different in the Aura, since its components are attached to the back of a huge 34-inch display. The graphics card, situated to the right of the motherboard, exhausts out the bottom of the display. It gets most of its fresh air through perforations above the entire length of the card… The processor’s liquid cooling unit exhausts out the top of the Aura, to the left of the motherboard. The remaining active exhaust is provided by a slim 120mm fan, located directly above the motherboard, mounted on the plastic rear cover. Passive airflow is courtesy of numerous perforations on the back cover. As noted previously, the entire top of the Aura is also vented. The Aura’s fans are audible at all times, though generally unnoticeable in general use. The graphics card was generally silent at idle. The CPU cooler’s cylindrical fan unit, as well as the slim 120mm fan above the motherboard, were both audible, but also hardly noticeable due to their low RPM. Playing games changed the situation a bit, with the GPU fan kicking into high gear, and the CPU cooler working much harder. The single fan in the GTX 1080 Founders Edition had no whine, but the air rushing through its long cooler was hard to ignore. The CPU cooler’s fan had a mechanical whir at its upper RPMs. All the fans combined created an audible hum, which we could hear across a living room. The mid-ATX gaming desktops we test tend to be quieter, though not always. Again, the Aura is a different design, so we’ll chalk up the extra noise as one of the acceptable (and perhaps inevitable) compromises of fitting a full-power gaming PC into the back of a huge display. We recorded component temperatures while playing Rise of the Tomb Raider for 60 minutes. With GPU-Z, we logged the GTX 1080 topping out at 87 degrees. The log showed its core boost clock fluctuating between 1,607MHz and 1,784MHz once it reached 86 degrees, usually remaining under 1,683MHz from that point forward. In other words, it wasn’t sustaining its maximum boost clock, likely due to thermal conditions. Nonetheless, we can’t necessarily fault the Aura for the GTX 1080’s minor thermal inconsistencies, as the temperatures we observed are normal for a GTX 1080 Founders Edition. The overclocked Core i7-6700K in our review unit also became quite warm. The maximum temperatures of its cores ranged from 73 to 77 degrees C by the end of our gaming sessions, measured with HWMonitor. We could hear the CPU cooling unit’s fan kick into high gear at that point. These temperatures are well below the thermal shutoff point for the Core i7-6700K, though on the high side, given that the CPU was liquid-cooled.  But they’re not a danger, by any means, nor did they negatively affect system performance.

Chrome, Firefox, and IE Browser Hijacker Distributed via Legitimate Software GO Intel McAfee warns users about Lavians software Aug 10, 2016 21:10 GMT  ·  By Catalin Cimpanu  ·  Share:  Intel McAfee security experts have discovered that the latest versions of the infamous Bing.vc browser-hijacking malware are delivered via applications distributed by Lavians Inc. Security companies have known of the existence of the Bing.vc malware for more than a year, and many of them have added support for removing this threat from the computers of infected users. Intel McAfee: Blame Lavians Inc.! According to a report from McAfee, recent versions of the Bing.vc malware have been found bundled with legitimate-looking products. The security vendor is pointing the finger at a software company called Lavians Inc. "We have come across several files from Lavians Inc. that look like legitimate applications but may pose a serious risk," writes Intel's Santosh Revankar. "We have observed that Lavians Inc. is repackaging clean applications with a browser hijacker to avoid suspicion and to increase its outreach." Intel says that most of the infected files hide as driver utilities, using names such as HP DESKJET F4580 Driver Utility Setup, DELL Inspiron 5100 Drivers Utility Setup, or Acer Aspire ONE ZG5 Drivers Utility Setup. Bing.vc affects Chrome, Firefox, IE When users install these files, they'll get the legitimate application, but also Bing.vc, hidden inside a file called IconOverlayEx.dll. Bing.vc will install into Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer, and it will take over the site's homepage and insert ads into visited websites. The page to which this browser hijacker will redirect all users is Bing.vc, hence the malware's name. Hijacked Google Chrome homepage This website has nothing to do with Microsoft's Bing service and is quite strange that Microsoft hasn't registered the domain beforehand or moved to take it down by now. Ironically, the Intel McAfee team has noticed that a link on this hijacked homepage leads users to a site that tries to sell them a very expensive utility to fix their browser hijacking problem. Uninstalling the infected app doesn't help Users who notice something strange and move to uninstall the original driver utility they installed will find that all files will be removed, except for IconOverlayEx.dll, which will remain on the infected system. During the uninstall routine, Bing.vc will alter the user's PC registry keys and add two new entries that will load the DLL on every boot-up. By doing so, even after uninstalling the original infected files, Bing.vc remains on the system. Users who want to get rid of this infection have to remove the registry keys by hand or use an automated PC clean-up utility that usually comes with antivirus software. Additionally, the shortcuts for each browser also need to be cleaned up by deleting the URL at the end of the application target parameter, as in the image below.

Intel Linux Video Driver Now on Par with the Windows One, Thanks to Collabora GO The graphics driver now features OpenGL 4.4 support Aug 10, 2016 21:03 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  Collabora's Mark Filion informs Softpedia about the latest progress made by past and present Collabora developers on bringing the Intel graphics driver on par with its Windows equivalent. In a recent blog post, Timothy Arceri reports for Collabora that it's a known fact that the open source Intel OpenGL video driver has always been behind times, always trying to catch up to the proprietary video drivers that are available for Microsoft Windows operating systems. That ends now, as the Collabora team, who has always had lots of contributions to the Linux kernel, has managed to reach a major milestone by implementing OpenGL 4.4 support to the open source Intel video driver supporting recent Intel Broadwell and Intel Skylake platforms. "At Collabora, I recently had the opportunity to implement the ARB_enhanced_layouts extension which was last extension required to enable 4.4," says Timothy Arceri. "As described in the extensions overview this extension brings six new enhancements to the GL shader language to improve the development experience for OpenGL developers." OpenGL 4.5 support coming soon to the open source Intel driver Shortly after the respective announcement, Collabora developer Timothy Arceri should start work and concentrate all of their efforts to upgrade the OpenGL support to version 4.5, thus making the open source Intel graphics driver the best and allowing users of GNU/Linux distributions to fully take advantage of their Intel hardware. In the upcoming months, Collabora's kernel developers and hackers will work hard on bringing more awesome features and performance improvements to the open source Intel OpenGL video driver, such as shader cache and loop unrolling for improving the optimization passes for the GL shader language compiler. All these goodies should be available in the next major kernel release, Linux 4.8, which has just received its first Release Candidate build. #Intel graphics driver#Intel video driver#OpenGL 4.4#OpenGL 4.5#Linux subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Fedora 24 Linux Gets Another Set of Updated Live ISO Images, Download Now Lumina Desktop Environment Hits 1.0 Milestone After Four Years of Development openSUSE Tumbleweed Linux Users Get LibreOffice 5.2 and Wireshark 2.0.5, More Canonical Makes It Easy to Port Native iOS and Android Apps to Ubuntu Mobile OS Donald Trump, Tim Cook Discuss Building iPhones in the United States iPhone 8 to Feature Traditional Wireless Charging like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Lenovo Builds a New Microsoft Surface Clone and It Looks Fabulous Anonymous Hackers Want McAfee to Be Trump’s Security Adviser, Call for March HTC Desire 650 Announced, a Low Mid-End Smartphone for the Masses Glossy Black Galaxy S7 edge Leaks in Live Pictures Download Windows 10 64-bit Drivers for Acer’s Aspire TC-710 Desktop Model Intel Rolls Out Several New BIOS Versions for Its NUC Kits and Compute Sticks    Collabora brings OpenGL 4.4 support to the open source Intel Linux driver New Linux Apps Vendetta Online: A MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game) that takes place in space Ruby: An object-oriented programming language for GNU/Linux and UNIX-like operating systems Opera: Surf the Internet in a safer, faster and easier way with the Opera browser for Linux Google Chrome: The powerful, lightweight and easy-to-use web browser developed by the well known Google company Doomsday Engine: An Open Source 3D-graphics enhanced game engine for Doom, Heretic, and Hexen games GNOME Software: A free project that provides a Software Center app of the GNOME desktop environment GNOME Music: Listen to music, upload music and share audio files across devices with this GNOME app Reader comments Vivaldi 1.5 Lands as the World's First Web Browser to Control Philips Hue Lights more on: Vivaldi 1.5 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

On Monday, the chipmaker said it had acquired the deep learning startup, making it one of several tech firms increasingly focused on artificial intelligence. By Max Lewontin, Staff August 10, 2016 Save for later Saved Showgoers visit the Intel booth on the first day of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas in January 2013. The chipmaker said Monday it had acquired the deep learning startup Nervana, joining several other tech firms that have increased their focus on artificial intelligence in recent years. Rick Wilking/Reuters/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of With Intel’s acquisition of the deep learning startup Nervana Systems on Monday, the chipmaker is moving further into artificial intelligence, a field that’s become a key focus for tech companies in recent years. Intel’s purchase of the company comes in the wake of Apple’s acquisition of Seattle-based Turi Inc.  last week, while Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Twitter, and Samsung have also made similar deals. Those purchases – large tech firms have bought 31 AI startups since 2011 – according to the research firm CB Insights, also underscore a shift. While AI was once thought of as a sci-fi concept, the technology behind it has come to propel a slew of innovations by hardware and software companies that both attract attention – like self-driving cars – and ones that often go unnoticed, like product recommendations on Amazon. Recommended: Despite sci-fi tropes, robots make better managers, study says “Intel’s acquisition of [Nervana] is an acknowledgment that this area of deep learning, machine learning, artificial intelligence, is really an important part of all companies going forward," says David Schubmehl, an analyst who focuses on the field at the research firm IDC. Despite sci-fi tropes, robots make better managers, study says Photos of the Day Photos of the day 11/23 Intel also purchased Saffron Technologies , which aims to solve complex problems using “cognitive computing,” last fall. But, Mr. Schubmehl tells The Christian Science Monitor, “I think this [recent purchase] is noteworthy because it provides [Intel] with both software and hardware technology.” Nervana’s focus, deep learning, builds on advances in machine learning, the idea of training a computer to “think” and recognize patterns. Deep learning expands so-called neural networks, which are modeled on the human brain, to a much larger scale, allowing a computer to perform tasks such as recognizing an image of a cat without necessarily having prior knowledge of what a cat looked like.  For Intel, which has focused on cloud-based computing systems, machine learning represents a necessary step to contend with the reams of data they generate.  “There is far more data being given off by these machines than people can possibly sift through,” Jason Waxman, an Intel vice president, told Recode. Working with Nervana also offers Intel an opportunity to expand machine learning capabilities in its own chips, rather than simply having software that works on top of them, Recode reports. For many users, these technologies often go unnoticed, Schubmehl notes.  “Do you really spend time thinking about when Amazon says ‘Hey, other people like this product, would you be interested in this product?’” he asks.  “That’s a product of machine learning, but you don’t think of it that way. You just look at as ‘Gee, Amazon actually knows me a little better than other people, and they’re recommending products that I’m actually interested in,’” he adds. In other cases, users have been quick to point to concerns about potential biases hidden in such algorithm-driven technologies. Last year, some complained when they noticed that the first result for a Google search for “female CEO” was a Barbie doll. In June, a video showing that a Google search for “three black teenagers” produced a series of mugshots , in sharp contrast to a search for “three white teenagers,” went viral. Civil libertarians and researchers have also expressed alarm about what happens when such technology is combined with personal data about users, as in tech firm Samsung’s acquisition of the “big data” company Joyent. “I think that a company that is involved in manufacturing devices that people hold so close to their hearts, it behooves them to tread very carefully,” Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, told the Monitor in June. But at this point, many companies' focus on machine learning shows little sign of slowing down, Schubmehl says. For businesses making hardware, whether Intel, the carmaker Tesla, or the power titan GE, the technology offers the ability to integrate their products with software in a variety of ways. Self-driving buses , or robotic manufacturing equipment, he notes, are two of the results. "At some point it will change enterprise software, and technology in general, so that everything is machine learning-enabled in one fashion or another, so it will slow down at that point," he says. "But, I think for the foreseeable future, there’s a lot of what I would call ‘dumb’ software out there that has to be made smart."

Gabrielle Lurie/AFP SAN FRANCISCO, USA – US-based Intel on Tuesday, August 9, announced a deal to buy an artificial intelligence startup as the computer chip colossus looks to broaden its role in data centers and the expanding "internet of things," a concept that envisions all everyday objects having data connectivity. Intel did not disclose how much it is paying for San Diego-based Nervana Systems but US media reports put the price at more than $350 million. "With this acquisition, Intel is formally committing to pushing the forefront of AI (artificial intelligence) technologies," Nervana co-founder and chief executive Naveen Rao said in a blog post. "We can now shatter the old paradigm and move into a new regime of computing." Founded two years ago in Southern California, Nervana has specialized in combining hardware and software to help machines think in ways similar to human brains, according to the companies. Intel plans to put Nervana expertise to work in non-consumer Xeon and Xeon Phi processors found in workstations and servers to better handle "deep learning" in the internet cloud, Intel data center group executive vice president Diane Bryant said in an online post. "While artificial intelligence is often equated with great science fiction, it isn't relegated to novels and movies," Bryant said. "AI is all around us." Apple acquires its own AI startup Just a day earlier, August 8, Apple confirmed that it has bought US machine learning startup Turi. The Seattle-based company specializes in enabling developers to imbue software applications with artificial intelligence, so the apps learn to think more the way people do. Apple declined to elaborate the deal, telling AFP that it "buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans." Technology news website GeekWire cited people close to the acquisition as pegging the purchase price at $200 million. Apple has been stepping up its artificial intelligence efforts to compete against rival services from Amazon, Google and Microsoft. Improving machine learning capabilities of its Siri virtual assistant could enable it to better understand intent behind commands or queries spoken by users. Siri is spreading from Apple mobile devices to its Mac computer system, allowing users of the PCs to search their machines or the Internet with voice commands, according to recent announcements from the Silicon Valley-based company. The move expands the footprint for Siri, which is facing increased competition from Microsoft's Cortana, Amazon's Alexa and Google Now, which also use artificial intelligence. These recent acquisitions by Silicon Valley giants are a glimpse into tech's future – a future rich with artificial intelligence not completely unlike the ones we see in popular fiction. It's happening now. When Google auto-completes your search entries or when your voice assistant makes suggestions based on your previous interactions with your smartphone – that's AI. How it develops from here, we're about to see. English musician Brian Eno, quoted at Rappler's #ThinkPH event, offers the ideal: “One day, humans will be living a life of leisure, our every one need met by machines and computers, leaving us free to pursue more intellectual and creative pastimes. And rather than engaging in tedious, repetitive work, this will herald a new arrival of the leisure economy.” – Rappler.com Filed under:AI•Apple•Nervana Systems•Turi•acquisitions•artificial intelligence•Intel HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?

File picture: John G. Mabanglo San Francisco - US-based Intel on Tuesday announced a deal to buy an artificial intelligence startup as the computer chip colossus looks to broaden its role in data centres and the expanding Internet of Things. Intel did not disclose how much it is paying for Nervana Systems, but US media reports put the price at more than $350 million. “With this acquisition, Intel is formally committing to pushing the forefront of AI (artificial intelligence) technologies,” Nervana co-founder and chief executive Naveen Rao said in a blog post. “We can now shatter the old paradigm and move into a new regime of computing.” Founded two years ago in Southern California, Nervana has specialised in combining hardware and software to help machines think in ways similar to human brains, according to the companies. Intel plans to put Nervana expertise to work in Xeon and Xeon Phi chips to better handle “deep learning” in the Internet cloud, Intel data centre group executive vice president Diane Bryant said in an online post. “While artificial intelligence is often equated with great science fiction, it isn't relegated to novels and movies,” Bryant said. “AI is all around us.” AFP Like us on Facebook Connect with us on LinkedIn Hungry for more business news?

Intel is getting serious about artificial intelligence, specifically as a driver of chip sales. On Tuesday, the company announced plans to acquire Nervana Systems, a deep learning company based in San Diego, Calif. Financial terms for the deal were not disclosed, but Recode reports the deal is valued at around $408 million, citing "a source with knowledge of the deal." "With this acquisition, Intel is formally committing to pushing the forefront of AI technologies," said Naveen Rao, CEO and cofounder of Nervana Systems, in a blog post. Artificial intelligence is not science fiction, said Diane Bryant, EVP and general manager of the data center group at Intel, in a blog post. Rather, she said, it is all around us, enabling speech recognition, image recognition, fraud detection, and self-driving cars. "Encompassing compute methods like advanced data analytics, computer vision, natural language processing and machine learning, artificial intelligence is transforming the way businesses operate and how people engage with the world," said Bryant. At the heart of the industry's enthusiasm for AI is the massive amount of data available through online interaction, mobile devices, sensors, and various other inputs to train AI models. With enough data, AI can make good decisions, and it may be necessary to make sense of large data sets. "The ability to analyze and derive value from that data is one of the most exciting opportunities for us all," said Bryant. "Central to that opportunity is artificial intelligence." Intel's Diane Bryant with Nervana's cofounder Naveen Rao. (Image: Intel) Intel says it intends to use Nervana's technology to optimize the Intel Math Kernel Library and to integrate it into industry-standard AI frameworks, and to improve the deep learning performance of Intel Xeon and Intel Xeon Phi processors. The chipmaker aims to supply the hardware that powers the intensive computation behind AI software. It also has to move fast, because other technology companies are already developing silicon optimized for AI number crunching. Bryant says that more than 97% of the servers handling machine learning computation rely on Intel processors, but Intel's dominance may not last as other companies develop processors optimized for AI workloads. [Curious about machine learning? Read Google Open Sources Machine Learning Library TensorFlow.] At Google I/O in May, CEO Sundar Pichai revealed that Google has created an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) solely to handle deep learning calculations made with the Tensor Flow framework that Google released as an open source project last year. In April, NVIDIA unveiled its Tesla P100 GPU chip for deep learning computation. In December last year, Facebook open sourced the design for its Big Sur AI server, made with components from Quanta and NVIDIA. In February, MIT researchers showed off "Eyeriss," a chip design they claim can handle AI processing about 10 times faster than current GPUs. Overall, fewer than 10% of servers worldwide handled machine learning tasks last year, according to Bryant, but industry enthusiasm for the AI appears bound to drive more usage. During Google's Q3 2015 earnings call, Pichai described AI and its related disciplines as central to the company's future. Baidu, Facebook, and Microsoft, and perhaps even Apple (which last week acquired AI startup Turi) have shown similar interest in the technology. Intel has finally recognized that AI isn't a passing fad.  Thomas Claburn has been writing about business and technology since 1996, for publications such as New Architect, PC Computing, InformationWeek, Salon, Wired, and Ziff Davis Smart Business.

ITProPortal Search RSS News Features Analysis Guides Reviews Categories Business Hardware Security Software Mobile Enterprise Cloud Networks Public Sector Startups Web Intel buys AI start-up Nervana for £312 million By Sead Fadilpašić Shares Intel is buying machine learning start-up Nervana, and it's paying some serious money for it. According to multiple media sources, the 48-person start-up was acquired for a stunning $408 million (£312m). Nervana is an artificial intelligence company which is looking to integrate AI beyond the usual software – it wants to squeeze it into the chips themselves. And who better to team up with to achieve that goal than Intel – one of the biggest chipmakers in the world. But the deal isn't around consumer electronics – it's about chips in data centres. According to Intel vice president Jason Waxman, data centres and internet of things devices will operate such huge amounts of data, it will be virtually impossible for humans to use them. Beyond all of this is an interesting idea – Intel believes artificial intelligence, especially in IoT and data centres, will eclipse the move to cloud computing. “There's always a next wave,” Waxman said. “I firmly believe this is not only the next wave but something that will dwarf the last wave.” On the other hand, it seems as Nervana doesn't mind being part of Intel, either. “By selling to Intel”, he said, “we have access to technology we'd never dream about.” Photo credit: StockStudio / Shutterstock Load Comments GET YOUR FREE MAGAZINE NET: The Money Issue worth £5.99 Join over 7000 ITProPortal subscribers!

Micron QuantX technology SSDs will use 3D XPoint non-volatile memory and are a completely separate set of products to Intel's Optane range. There will be fantastic performance advances on offer when these drives come to market, however the cost of 3D XPoint memory is about four to five times more expensive than NAND flash. In a blog post Micron crows about the performance of its upcoming QuantX technology drives, using 3D XPoint memory. It says that users can benefit from performance "over 10X better than the best NAND flash-based SSDs" when using a PCIe interface. The EE Times observed "prototype SSDs with Xpoint memory chips on a PCIe Gen 3 interface handling writes at less than 20 microseconds and reads and less than 10 ms" at the Flash Memory Summit, in Santa Clara, California. With access to four PCIe channels Micron QuantX drives could deliver up to 900,000 IOPS, or with eight lane PCIe connections up to 1.9 million IOPS. Turning to information about capacities, Micron plans to launch QuantX SSD products ranging from 200GB to 1.6TB. The first generation of drives will be aimed at data centre customers, arriving from approx Q2 2017 onwards. It isn't until 2019 that Micron forsees its 3D Xpoint based memory products providing 'break-out' revenue. Previously Intel has indicated that 3D Xpoint offers up to 10x the density of NAND so the tech will enable smaller, higher capacity storage devices. Micron revealed that 3D XPoint memory costs about half as much as DRAM but about four or five times as much as flash NAND. Due to this it is thought unlikely to replace NAND for prosumers, for now, but will replace DRAM for many enterprise applications. Meanwhile major storage and server vendors are clamouring to get 3D XPoint memory based products like Micron's QuantX technology range. Actual product pricing wasn't touched upon but it is thought that the expense of the new 3D Xpoint memory means that Micron will focus on enterprise, however Intel has plans for M.2 Optane drives for laptops and tablets. In other Micron news, the firm has introduced Mobile 3D NAND for next-generation smartphones. The first such products will be based upon the Universal Flash Storage (UFS) 2.1 standard and could offer up to 20 per cent better energy efficiency. All photos from The SSD Review.

Inability to factor costs correctly or taking the industry for a ride? Posted by badass - Wed 10 Aug 2016 12:15 shaithis That's a FAR cry from the “cheaper than NAND” line they were touting at the end of last year. Inability to factor costs correctly or taking the industry for a ride? Except they weren't. The line was “cheaper than DRAM” Posted by shaithis - Wed 10 Aug 2016 12:47 badass Except they weren't. The line was “cheaper than DRAM” How much faster is the 3D XPoint non-volatile memory? Intel and Micron claim it offers an astonishing speed of “up to 1,000 times faster than NAND”. Furthermore the new chips are ten times denser than conventional memory, thanks to the 3D structure and transistor-less design. The good news doesn't stop there as Intel and Micron scientists created the new chips to offer 1,000 times the endurance of NAND, lower power usage and to be more economical to produce. So, they did say that. Source Posted by 3dcandy - Wed 10 Aug 2016 12:54 I'm surprised at the cost to be honest…. but it should still be a good advance in tech Posted by sykobee - Wed 10 Aug 2016 14:04 The cost is the biggest downer here. Effectively DRAM pricing for Storage performance. You could get 200GB of this for the price of 100GB of DRAM - many would go for the DRAM. Sure, it's a factor of two cheaper than DRAM, and it's an order of magnitude lower latency than SSD (10x, not 1000x faster), but it's still 3 orders of magnitude higher latency than DRAM. Bandwidth wasn't mentioned, but over PCIe it's going to be far lower than DRAM too. But, every advance starts like this, and then costs come down, densities go up, and performance improves.

Co-founded by Naveen Rao in 2014 and headquartered in San Diego, California, Nervana has a fully-optimised software and hardware stack for deep learning. The US-based chip giant isn’t actually saying how much it is paying, but a source with knowledge of the deal said it is valued at around $408 million, according to Recode, a technology news website that focuses on the business of Silicon Valley. “Today, I am excited to announce that Intel signed a definitive agreement to acquire Nervana Systems, a recognised leader in deep learning,” Diane Bryant, Executive Vice President of Data Center Group at Intel said. “We will share more about Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the amazing experiences it enables at our Intel Developer Forum next week,” Bryant said. “Their IP and expertise in accelerating deep learning algorithms will expand Intel’s capabilities in the field of Artificial Intelligence. We will apply Nervana’s software expertise to further optimise the Intel Math Kernel Library and its integration into industry standard frameworks,” she said. “Nervana’s Engine and silicon expertise will advance Intel’s AI portfolio and enhance the deep learning performance and TCO of our Intel Xeon and Intel Xeon Phi processors,” she added. “We believe that bringing together the Intel engineers who create the Intel Xeon and Intel Xeon Phi processors with the talented Nervana Systems’ team, we will be able to advance the industry faster than would have otherwise been possible. We will continue to invest in leading edge technologies that complement and enhance Intel’s AI portfolio,” Bryant said. “We’ve always been a mission driven company. Even though we won’t be a startup any longer, our mission hasn’t changed. We are here to make a dent in the world of computation, Rao said. “With this deal, we can now shatter the old paradigm and move into a new regime of computing. We’ll look back in 10 years and see this time as the inflection point of when compute architectures became neural,” he said. According to Rao, the semiconductor integrated circuit is one of humanity’s crowning achievements and Intel has the best semiconductor technology in the world. Nervana’s AI expertise combined with Intel’s capabilities and huge market reach will allow us to realise our vision and create something truly special, Rao said. He said that the deal didn’t reflect any hurdles in getting more capital to stay independent. “Raising money was not the problem. That was going to be relatively easy. But by selling to Intel, we have access to technology we’d never dream about,” Rao was quoted as saying Recode.

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday     Intel Acquires AI Start-up Nervana Systems Posted: Aug 10 2016, 1:48am CDT | by IANS, in News | Latest Business News      Announcing a big foray into the world of artificial intelligence (AI), the chip giant Intel has acquired San Diego, California-based deep learning start-up Nervana Systems. Don't Miss: The Black Friday Deals to Buy now on Amazon Coming ahead of the Intel Developer Forum next week, the acquisition gives Intel a definitive head start towards advanced data analytics, computer vision, natural language processing and machine learning. Although the financial details were not disclosed, according to a Re/Code report, the software giant is paying more than $400 million to buy Nervana led by former Qualcomm researcher Naveen Rao. "We will apply Nervana's software expertise to further optimise the Intel Math Kernel Library and its integration into industry standard frameworks," Diane Bryant, Executive Vice President of Data Center Group at Intel, said in a statement on Wednesday. "Nervana's Engine and silicon expertise will advance Intel's AI portfolio and enhance the deep learning performance and TCO of our Intel Xeon and Intel Xeon Phi processors," she explained. Intel processors power nearly 97 percent of servers deployed to support machine learning workloads today. "Nervana's IP and expertise in accelerating deep learning algorithms will expand Intel's capabilities in the field of AI," Bryant added. The Intel Xeon processor E5 family is the most widely deployed processor for deep learning inference and the recently launched Intel Xeon Phi processor delivers the scalable performance needed for deep learning training. "While less than 10 percent of servers worldwide were deployed in support of machine learning last year, the capabilities and insights it enables makes machine learning the fastest growing form of AI," the Intel executive said. "We will continue to invest in leading edge technologies that complement and enhance Intel's AI portfolio," she added. Nervana recently raised $25 million in venture funding and also has a contract to work with In-Q-tel, the US intelligence community's venture arm. According to Rao, the deal did not reflect any hurdles in getting more capital to stay independent. "Raising money was not the problem. That was going to be relatively easy but by selling to Intel we have access to technology we'd never dream about," Rao was quoted as saying.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Aug 9, 2016 at 9:00PM Image credit: Intel.  A little while ago, respected technology website PC Watch revealed the existence of a future Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) processor family code-named Coffee Lake. This processor family, PC Watch reported, would essentially be a fourth generation of processors built on the company's 14-nanometer manufacturing technology aimed at certain segments of the personal-computer market. Intel hasn't publicly commented about the reports, but a company executive may have accidentally revealed the existence of Coffee Lake at a recent investor conference. Here's what was said Intel's Brice Hill recently presented at an investor conference hosted by Pacific Crest. At the conference, an analyst asked Hill about the potential impact of the elongation of Intel's development cycle, from about two years to about three, on Intel's manufacturing lead over the rest of the industry, as well as the desirability of Intel's products to end customers. Hill had quite a lot to say, but here's the bit that's relevant to Coffee Lake (emphasis mine): "On product competitiveness, what you see with Intel currently is we're able to push the performance of our current generations of products. So for a short period of time, if we elongate the design cycle, we can develop a third or fourth generation of product that gives you a performance boost in the market that continues the customer expectation from a performance advancement perspective." Intel may be employing a new strategy with respect to process The main show-stopper with respect to Intel's 14-nanometer ramp-up was that it couldn't get manufacturing yields under control. Not only did this lead to an elevated cost structure for 14-nanometer products relative to their 22-nanometer predecessors, but it also led to some supply shortages, particularly for high-performance parts. Intel's problem is that, historically, once it begins transitioning to a new manufacturing technology, it has to transition practically all of its products -- from high-performance desktop chips all the way to low-power 2-in-1 processors -- to this new manufacturing technology fairly quickly. In the past, when Intel's process development went more smoothly, this didn't present much of an issue. Today, however, the reality is that Intel doesn't seem to be able to develop new manufacturing technologies and get them to high yield levels as quickly as it could previously. Intel's new strategy could be this: Move to new manufacturing technologies as quickly as possible in segments that can really benefit from them, while building new products on more mature technologies for market segments that don't benefit as much from such technology transitions. What such a strategy allows Intel to do is to keep a large portion of its product mix in more mature manufacturing technologies, minimizing the potential negative gross margin impact that would come from transitioning other products to a newer, lower-yielding manufacturing process. Once yields on the company's newest manufacturing process matures, Intel can then begin releasing new products based on that process into segments of the market that hadn't yet undergone the process transition without fear of gross-margin erosion.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Nervana blijft actief en blijft ook gevestigd in San Diego.  Nervana Systems lanceerde onder meer een cloudsysteem waarmee klanten op afstand gebruik konden maken van kunstmatige intelligentie. Het bedrijf werkt echter ook aan een speciale chip die zich puur richt op kunstmatige intelligentie. Die chip zou in 2017 op de markt moeten verschijnen. Intel zal de technologie van Nervana gebruiken om zich verder te richten op kunstmatige intelligentie en de producten die zich daar mee bezig houden te verbeteren, zo laat het bedrijf weten.  "We will apply Nervana’s software expertise to further optimize the Intel Math Kernel Library and its integration into industry standard frameworks," Diane Bryant, executive vice president and general manager of the Data Center Group at Intel, said of the acquisition. "Nervana's Engine and silicon expertise will advance Intel’s AI portfolio and enhance the deep learning performance and TCO of our Intel Xeon and Intel Xeon Phi processors." As for Nervana itself, the company will continue to operate out of its San Diego location, and doesn't expect staffing changes. "Nervana intends to continue all existing development efforts including the Nervana Neon deep learning framework, Nervana deep learning platform, and the Nervana Engine deep learning hardware," Naveen Rao, CEO and co-founder of the company, wrote today. "The combination of Nervana’s technology and expertise incorporated into Intel’s portfolio will take deep learning/AI solutions to the next level."

Although the financial details were not disclosed, according to a Re/Code report, the software giant is paying more than $400 million to buy Nervana led by former Qualcomm researcher Naveen Rao. “We will apply Nervana’s software expertise to further optimise the Intel Math Kernel Library and its integration into industry standard frameworks,” Diane Bryant, Executive Vice President of Data Center Group at Intel, said in a statement on Wednesday. “Nervana’s Engine and silicon expertise will advance Intel’s AI portfolio and enhance the deep learning performance and TCO of our Intel Xeon and Intel Xeon Phi processors,” she explained. Intel processors power nearly 97 per cent of servers deployed to support machine learning workloads today. “Nervana’s IP and expertise in accelerating deep learning algorithms will expand Intel’s capabilities in the field of AI,” Bryant added. The Intel Xeon processor E5 family is the most widely deployed processor for deep learning inference and the recently launched Intel Xeon Phi processor delivers the scalable performance needed for deep learning training. “While less than 10 per cent of servers worldwide were deployed in support of machine learning last year, the capabilities and insights it enables makes machine learning the fastest growing form of AI,” the Intel executive said.

Nervana recently raised $25 million in venture funding and also has a contract to work with In-Q-tel, the US intelligence community’s venture arm. According to Rao, the deal did not reflect any hurdles in getting more capital to stay independent. “Raising money was not the problem. That was going to be relatively easy but by selling to Intel we have access to technology we’d never dream about,” Rao was quoted as saying.

View Latest Posts >>> Core Edicts of the Khazarian Mafia (Part III) By Preston James, Ph.D on August 9, 2016 A core edict of the Khazarian Mafia Top Command is to transform the American Masses into self-hating, self-defeating, mind-kontrolled dupes who can never understand what is being done to them by the KM. by  Preston James   The KM has an age-old inter-generational agenda, and it us necessary for the KM to maintain abject secrecy otherwise the masses will revolt with pitchforks: We now know for certain there is a method and an age-old inter-generational agenda behind the seeming madness and unimaginable evil of the KM’s Top Chieftains, the soulless criminal psychopaths that control the Khazarian Mafia and set USG policy. The KM agenda is specific: It is now known that the KM has a specific Agenda. That agenda is to establish the KM’s desired end state, a One-world Global NWO system governed by Lucifer. These Top KM Chieftains believe they will be regenerated to immortality upon the arrival of their descended master Lucifer. And the KM has a select set of methodologies deployed to attain this evil agenda: And it is now known that the KM has a set of select methodologies used over the last 1,000 years to attain their agenda which is now close to attainment. And these methodologies include sophisticated mind-kontrol, deployment of synthetic terror and manufactured wars, induced drug addiction slavery, Fiat debt slavery, and a general strategy of “divide and conquer” to create ongoing chaos. They would perhaps already have attained their unimaginably evil agenda but for recent blockages due to the alternative news of the Internet and a spontaneously emerging populism inside America and Europe because of it. In their quest to always improve their ability to spy on the masses, the Secret Shadow Government (SSG) which is a KM creation, set up the Internet, believing it would be the greatest spy tool yet devised. That turned out to be true, but there was a serious side-effect that the Top Chieftains of the KM never expected. That was the quick emergence of the alternative media on the Internet and the steady increase in its users who left their Controlled Major Mass Media (CMMM) to habitually use it to get the news and to start researching current events as well as historical events of the past. The KM countered this by setting up hundreds of misinformation websites. However, in order to gain any following at all they had to play the “limited hangout” game. They had to include a fair proportion of truth in their stories or no one would use their sites or be subject to any of their propaganda as “bad payloads”. A lot of these misinformation websites supported by KM Cutouts and proprietaries would put out about 70-80% good info with a periodic very bad misinforming payload. Glenn Beck has been fingered by some as a typical example, others identify Alex Jones too, but there are likely many others. It is known that both periodically do carry some good stories too. Top of the Pyramid kissing their god of the black sun Satan What ended up happening with many users was that they became so sophisticated in their processing and understanding of how the world really works that they were not fooled by this”limited hangout” strategy. Many of these alternative news website users have been able to ignore the bad payloads and select the truth nuggets and connect these dots from many different websites in their heads, and come up with composites of what is really happening that are fairly accurate. Plus, there are some alternative media websites like Veterans Today or Rense.com which are often the first to dump serious hidden facts and Intel out there for all to use as they wish. What is the specific end game for the Top Chieftains of the KM?:  These Select Few KM criminal psychopaths believe that as they seat Lucifer in their NWO temple in Jerusalem to be their ruling world master, they will personally be transformed into eternal gods, and will rule the universe forever with their master Lucifer. The sad fact is that this Khazarian Mafia is just the current expression of this secret sect of Luciferians, going back all the way to ancient Babylonia and beyond. It is the Order of the Snake, but has many other names and is ancient Baal worship driven by a set of root beliefs called Babylonian Talmudism, but it is also known as Luciferianism, Satanism, High Freemasonry, OTO, and many more. The big problem the KM’s top Chieftains now face is the fact that slowly but surely the masses are finding out about who they are specifically and what their evil agenda is. Should these KM Top Chieftains be surprised when Goyim find out about this and want them indicted, arrested, jailed and executed for a whole laundry list of unimaginably evil capital crimes including mass-murder, war crimes, terrorism and crimes against humanity, and before the KM can complete its notoriously anti-human, anti-Goyim Globalist NWO Agenda? _________ White Dragon Society There has been a startling recent development reported by Benjamin Fulford, former Editor of Forbes for Japan who is periodically approached by the White Dragon Society (WDS). The WDS is a secret, incredibly wealthy, powerful organization of Chinese businessmen likely associated with Chinese Freemasonry. Benjamin Fulford, former Forbes Editor for Japan, incredibly gifted intellectually, multilingual, with known deep Intel connections and important back-channel contacts inside Japan and China and highly respected in certain high political circles there Recently, according to Benjamin Fulford’s account, the official representative of the White Dragon Society set him straight and apparently advised him that the WDS was very concerned with the way the Khazarian Mafia was misusing their power to generate tyranny, oppression, poverty, disease, and mass death all over the world. This WDS official representative and spokesman advised Benjamin Fulford that the WDS was going to issuing a “deck of playing cards” for the KM Top Chieftains. A deck of playing cards like the deck that the Bush2 administration issued in the second Gulf War and that these cards were going to have massive rewards behind them, totaling about 40 million USD, paid in gold Bullion upon proof of capture. VT in no way would recommend such an action, nor would I. Nor has Fulford, who has simply reported what is happening. This is important news because it could turn out to be a major lane changing event for the KM; something they really had far too much hubris to ever anticipate. The KM Top Chieftains have been accustomed to always winning and having the skids greased by Lucifer using supernatural means. But what if their god Lucifer is a lesser god and plans to now throw them under the bus in order to attain his own private agenda that doesn’t include them? All the recent evidence now points to that and it looks like because of the Internet and the worldwide populism it is generating, the KM is being exposed more and more by the day. Yes, it looks like the KM will likely be sacrificed itself by Lucifer so he can fool the world by pretending he is the good guy, the Christ, the Messiah. Is such a transformation necessary to fool as many of the world’s masses as possible? If true and that’s the way it seems, soon the KM Top Chieftains and most of their cutouts are going to be thrown under the bus. If this WDS “deck of cards” action actually begins in earnest, it will signify two things have already occurred: First, it implies that the KM’s abject secrecy and near complete mind-kontrol systems so necessary for the maintaining world power and hegemony have been breached, and the truth about KM evil Globalist NWO Agenda is now beginning to be publicly proclaimed worldwide. In order to maintain maximum power and control the KM ‘s Top Chieftains must maintain abject secrecy. That is why most Intel, except for those exposed to wide ranging events (usually only the Intel Cowboys) have been kept so highly compartmented that most VT readers know far more than they do. Intel Cowboys (some are women too) have been leaking the highest, most closely guarded secrets for the last 25 years ever since the iron curtain fell and the cold war ended. And there have been major leaks of KM secret evil as a result of various highly connected individuals at the periphery of the KM have started leaking their dirty laundry and inner sanctum secrets. Second, it would mean that at least one powerful, wealthy major secret society with its home-base in mainland China resents all the destruction and death the KM is deploying on the world and is going to take serious steps to expose it and stop it. And it would suggest that this particular secret society the WDS in now putting their vast wealth behind their decision that the KM must be stopped soon before the KM destroys the world and mass-murders 90% of the Earth’s population. _________ More actual core belief patterns of the KM Top Chieftains The actual core belief patterns of the KM Top Chieftains are based on their deep Babylonian Talmudic (Luciferian/Satanic) values which they use to determine their Core Edicts by which they establish policies while sitting at the top of their pyramidal Establishment Hierarchy. The actual core belief patterns of the KM Top Chieftains is an age old secret of these inbred “bloodline” families that form the nexus of the Khazarians and old black nobility. It is allegedly all based on their common secret occult network which insiders call the “Order of the Snake”. Others have called it the Black Sun, the Reich of the Black Sun, the Great Dragon (the alien ET beast, Draco), the Serpent”, but they all represent the Order of the Snake and ancient Babylonian Talmudism, aka secret Baal worship. It has been reported that this occult network which covers most of the world, is nothing more than the deep secret of the worldwide Satanic Cult network that is centered in the USA, the UK and Europe that serves up little kids to pedophiles to abuse and more than rarely tortures and sacrifices them. Here is a secretly recorded, later leaked video clip from a High Freemason ritual in which the first part involved hired women to provide “special” entertainment. You can only guess what is not included in this video clip, former High Freemasons who have attended such special meetings have suggested that these events ended up getting pretty spicy with top floors of expensive hotels rented and prepaid high class hookers for all. _________ The UK is run by High Freemasonry top to bottom, the police, the courts, the government and this is a poorly kept secret. In America a lot of these institutions are run by smaller numbers of High Freemasons and OTO members, but this is a closely guarded secret. Some are openly members of the Satanic/Pedophile network that traffics in child sex victims over the whole western world and much of the rest of the world too. Hitler and his top Nazi command were deeply involved in the Reich of the Black Sun, believed by some researchers to be covert Satanism. Some researchers believe human sacrifice rituals were done in the basement pit of Wewelsberg Castle. And during a short time, it was reported that 17,000 political prisoners were sacrificed in a special building that had hydraulically operated guillotines. The only reference I could find was a UK story that documented 16,500 executions by guillotine, but no mention of the hydraulic guillotines. The Core Edicts of the KM Top Chieftains are oriented to managing American institutions and American culture in such a way to mind-kontrol and manipulate the American Masses and We The People become dirtied up with drugs and alcohol and self-defeating, shameful behaviors. But these destructive behaviors also appear to cause individuals to self-hate, self-abuse further, and can lead also individuals to become self-defeating enemies of themselves, their families and society. This of course makes the KM’s attainment of their evil Globalist NWO Agenda so much easier. _________ Conclusion In order for the KM to attain it Globalist NWO Agenda, the KM must attain its goals: – destruction of normal male female sex roles; – diversity, perversity and political correctness as the “new normal”; – loss of American borders, culture and language; – out of control medical costs and costs of living due to inflation built created and mandated by the private Federal Reserve System; – no more living wages for employment; – the destruction of the American family; – no more interest on saving and investments that will match the inflation caused by FRS FIAT “fake money”; – massive unemployment and no more job security; – the end of unions; – and massive taxation, massive debt slavery and usurious credit card loans; – corruption of the Judiciary and discarding of the US Constitution by the USG and the Judiciary at all levels; – proliferation of weird occult networks and sometimes secret promotion of strange blood practices to extend the life of the rich super-elites; – massive weapons and drug trafficking into American Urban centers by the CIA and the promotion of gangs and use of terror entrapment ops to gain more central power and taxpayer financing; – socially engineered massive addiction to legal and illegal drugs and alcohol to promote gangs, foment massive chaos, and to destroy the general morality and character of the American Masses; – a generally poor and completely irrelevant public education system secretly designed inside the beltway to dumb kids down and make them good KM mind-kontrolled debt-slaves; – to poison the food and water with GMOs and endocrine disruptors; – to over-vaccinate with toxic vaccines that often cause mini-strokes and autism spectrum disorders in alarmingly high rates in innocent children unable to give adequate consent for themselves with parents too dumbed-down to know better; and – to entrain the masses through super high tech psychotronic induction means, including orbital based Helium 3 powered scalar transmitters, use of cell phone systems and WI-FI, mass-mind-kontrol through TV “programming”, as well as certain secretly deployed ELF ground wave systems and the little understood Lilly waves which can be transmitted through the power grid. But all these KM curses being deployed against the American Masses have only been able to be deployed because they first got control of almost every single American institution, including those of the Federal and State governments, the Judiciary, the Congress, private business, the NGOs and private foundations and think-tanks, the Administration, the High Military Command, American Intel and a now largely militarized LE system absorbed by the new KM-created and -run Homeland Security (DHS). Unless Americans wake up soon and start standing against these KM monsters en masse at every level inside and outside the USG and even within the KM itself, America will be soon destroyed, depopulated by 90% and there will be no future for America’s young children at all. _______________ Related Posts: Core Edicts of the Khazarian Mafia (Part IV) Core Edicts of the Khazarian Mafia Top Command (Part II) Vladimir Putin: Who will protect young boys from pedophiles and rapists in Europe?

That doesn’t mean he didn’t say some things that could be construed as his intent to expose the bad guys – but pass the word. 🙂 Thanks. Log in to Reply Preston James, Ph.D  August 15, 2016 at 11:32 am I was told it was an excerpt from the script from his speech at Colombia University which was suppressed and never published in full. Also he gave several speeches on the abhorrence of secrecy and made references in at least one to this. And as you suggest if he didn’t really state this as is, Bobby often discussed this with his top staff at the Dept of Justice when he was US Attorney General. When I heard that I thought he was referring to the vast reach of the Sicilian Mafia (Cosa Nostra). Now looking back I think he was referring to a much bigger criminal syndicate with the Sicilian Mafia only a small part. The fact that JFK signed an order to print US Dollars once again suggests that he looked at the Banksters as the root problem of this large criminal conspiracy. jonnbrown  August 24, 2016 at 10:41 am 100% agreed Dr. James.

The vatican also worships baal (sun worship) and that’s why all the occult symbolism. The churches in the U.S. support them because they tell them they’re the chosen ones. They end up supporting baal worship. Lots of links here about it: nut@n.nu Log in to Reply jensingr  August 10, 2016 at 4:52 pm I would like to add a couple of things regarding the freemasons. Notice the black and white tiled floor in the video which can be seen in many movies, music videos, commercials, architecture and many of the castles where they live. When you start to notice their “symbols” you will see how much they have infiltrated all industries. The black and white symbolizes the good vs. bad, duality which Lucifer uses to pit one thing against another and hold us in the pattern. Another interesting point…… there is a HUGE “scottish rite freemasonry” temple in none other than San Bernadino where they made their sacrifice….. right off the 210 freeway, which btw emits one of the most negative frequencies I have ever felt.

By Sarmistha Acharya August 10, 2016 07:13 BST Intel announced it will acquire deep learning startup Nervana SystemsGetty Images Intel has said it is acquiring deep learning startup Nervana Systems as the world's largest chip maker turns its focus on expanding its artificial intelligence portfolio. The startup, founded in 2014, has a fully optimised software and hardware stack for deep learning. The company said it will continue to operate out of its San Diego headquarters. "With this deal, we can now shatter the old paradigm and move into a new regime of computing....... Nervana's AI expertise combined with Intel's capabilities and huge market reach will allow us to realise our vision and create something truly special," said Nervana chief executive officer and co-founder Naveen Rao. Intel said it will apply Nervana's software expertise to optimise its Math Kernel Library. Besides, Nervana's Engine and silicon expertise will help Intel advance its "AI portfolio and enhance the deep learning performance and TCO of its Intel Xeon and Intel Xeon Phi processors." While the term of the deal is yet to be disclosed, a source with knowledge of the matter told Recode the purchase price is around $408m (£312). Intel vice president Jason Waxman said the shift to AI could affect its move to cloud computing. He said machine learning is needed as the company moves from a world in which people control a couple of devices that connect to the internet to one in which billions of devices are connecting and talking to one another. Nervana has raised $25m in venture funding and also has a contract to work with In-Q-tel. "Raising money was not the problem. That was going to be relatively easy. But by selling to Intel we have access to technology we'd never dream about," Rao said. Intel said its processor powers more than 97% of the servers deployed to support machine learning workloads. Its Xeon processor belonging to the E5 family is the most widely deployed processor for the deep learning interface. The new Xeon Phi processor delivers performance that is required for deep learning training. "We believe that bringing together the Intel engineers who create the Intel Xeon and Intel Xeon Phi processors with the talented Nervana Systems' team, we will be able to advance the industry faster than would have otherwise been possible," said Diane Bryant, Intel's executive vice president and general manager of the Data Center Group. "We will continue to invest in leading edge technologies that complement and enhance Intel's AI portfolio," she added.

Nervana, founded in 2014, operates a hosted platform for deep learning that’s geared towards solving “machine-learning problems,” the company says. The platform is optimized “from algorithms down to silicon,” and has been used for a wide range of tasks, including analyzing seismic data, studying plant genomes to find new hybrids and even searching for places to drill for oil. The most common use case however, is businesses looking to use Nervana’s cloud service to build and deploy applications that make use of deep learning, which is a branch of AI that’s used to uncover patterns in large pools of data, and perform voice and image recognition. More importantly, perhaps, Nervana is also said to be building a specialized processor, called an ASIC, that’s customized for deep learning. Intel didn’t disclose terms of the deal, but Re/Code reported that the figure is likely north of $400 million. “We will apply Nervana’s software expertise to further optimize the Intel Math Kernel Library and its integration into industry standard frameworks,” said Diane Bryant, head of Intel’s Data Center Group, in a blog post. In addition, Bryant said Nervana’s expertise will help “advance Intel’s AI portfolio and enhance the deep-learning performance and TCO of our Intel Xeon and Intel Xeon Phi processors.” Intel adds AI “inside” its chips Computing has only just transitioned from mainframes and PCs to servers and cloud-based data center, but already it’s on the verge of a second transition, with the emergence of artificial intelligence technologies capable of injecting smarts into almost any object. Deep learning is at the core of this transition, responsible for new technological wonders such as self-driving cars and instant language translation on our phones. And now, chip makers like Intel are set to accelerate this transition by embedding deep learning software directly into the microprocessors that power everything from smartphones and connected cars to drones and much, much more. RELATED:  Microsoft says its speech recognition AI is a match for any human Intel, which has seen its PC market cash cow slowly but surely erode in the last few years, is desperate to be among the leaders of this brave new world. To date, most of its efforts in the AI space have focused on adapting its latest generation Xeon chips for use in AI and machine learning. Just last year it released a special version of that chip, called Xeon Phi, which came with more cores for parallel processing. With Nervana on board, Intel gains expertise on the software side that it can put to use right away. It also gains access to Nervana’s designs for specialized deep learning chips, so we can expect to see the development of these accelerate rapidly. Naveen Rao, who helped develop neural computer networks at Qualcomm Inc. before founding Nervana, said the company’s chip designs made it a natural fit for Intel. “Nervana’s AI expertise combined with Intel’s capabilities and huge market reach will allow us to realize our vision and create something truly special,” Rao said in a blog post announcing the acquisition. One of the chip’s key capabilities is said to be a much higher rate of data flow when compared with regular chips in use today. Rao told Fortune that the new chips are designed to mimic the parallel operation of neurons and synapses in the human brain in order to read and write data from storage, and share that data with other chips extremely rapidly. Nervana’s chips will be able to transfer data at speeds of 2.4 terabytes a second, with an ultra low latency of around five to ten times faster than current chips, Rao said.

With Nervana's suite of technology soon becoming part of Intel's portfolio, the chipmaker can now venture into creating even more stable and more powerful processors that run A.I. on board.  ( Intel ) Advertisement Deep learning startup Nervana has become Intel's latest acquisition target, in a deal that signals the microprocessor company's move deeper into the territory of artificial intelligence. While Intel has yet to release official figures, a source familiar with the acquisition says the agreement could be worth more than $400 million, Recode reports. The Next Revolution In Computing? Nervana is known for its advancement of A.I. through a combination of neuroscience, computer engineering and machine learning. The startup believes A.I. "will be the foundation of the next revolution in computing" as it rivals human performance — and Intel shares this belief. In fact, machine learning may prove to be even more revolutionary than cloud computing. Jason Waxman, VP for Intel, predicts people will soon be moving from devices that simply connect to the internet to devices that connect and talk with each other. Artificial Intelligence On A Chip One of Intel's challenges so far has been to bring A.I. on to its chips, in data centers and the mass market. With Nervana's suite of technology soon becoming part of Intel's portfolio, the chipmaker can now venture into creating more stable and more powerful processors that run A.I. on board. Some 97 percent of servers that currently support machine learning workloads, for example, is already powered by Intel processors. "The Intel Xeon processor E5 family is the most widely deployed processor for deep learning inference," notes Diane Bryant, EVP and general manager of Intel's Data Center Group. On the other hand, the Xeon Phi processor offers the "scalable performance needed for deep learning training." In purchasing Nervana, Intel will be able to leverage Nervana's Engine and silicon expertise as it sharpens the Intel Xeon and Intel Xeon Phi processors' deep learning abilities even further. "Nervana intends to continue all existing development efforts, including the Nervana Neon deep learning framework, Nervana deep learning platform, and the Nervana Engine deep learning hardware," says Naveen Rao, CEO and cofounder of Nervana. Nervana Is Pushing The Envelope Rao's team of 48 will be retained, becoming an integral part of Intel's Data Center Group, but it will continue to operate from its original headquarters in San Diego. Also worth noting is the fact that Nervana will hold on to its brand even after the acquisition. The startup is barely three years old, but investors have already been keen at lending support for the A.I. company. In 2015, the startup was able to pull up $25 million through venture funding. "We pushed the performance envelope in deep learning and will soon have a revolutionary new architecture to push it even further," Rao adds.

It is ideal for low power, dense computing applications thanks to the Intel® Xeon® D series processor and Intel® Ethernet multi-host controller (code name Red Rock Canyon) which provides dual 100G Ethernet interfaces and 100G switch. "The Artesyn SharpSwitch PCIE-9205 card uses Open vSwitch offload to ensure the maximum number of cores are available for payload processing in NFV applications," said Todd Wynia, platforms marketing vice president, Artesyn Embedded Technologies. "For example, in NFV applications, the SharpSwitch card can be used to provide high-speed ingress and egress while doing Open vSwitch offload, allowing a very high percentage of compute resources in the system to be used for application processing, such as baseband processing, IPSec termination or voice and video transcoding." Virtual Switch to Augment Hardware Solution In virtualized environments with dynamic workloads, virtual switches are required to forward packets internally and connect virtual machines to the outside world. In many cases, these virtual switches are implemented with Open vSwitch, emulating the function provided by physical switches. But virtualized switching comes at a cost. In certain configurations, Open vSwitch has been shown to require as much as half of the available processor cores for switching the traffic to and from the VMs running on a given server. By focusing on the minimal requirements for typical applications, and building on top of Intel® Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK), Artesyn has designed a massively accelerated virtual switch to address these weaknesses. By using the SharpSwitch PCIE-9205 as an Open vSwitch accelerator, the vast majority of the available processor cycles in the system can be used for payload VMs. MaxCore™ Platform The SharpSwitch™ is optimized to work in Artesyn's MaxCore™ PCIe platforms which leverage off-the-shelf PCIe cards to create very low latency and low OpEx systems for applications such as vRAN, mini-CRAN, video transcode, VoLTE and security gateways.  Image SharpSwitch™ PCIE-9205 http://release.media-outreach.com/i/Download/5292 Company Logo http://release.media-outreach.com/i/Download/1489 About Artesyn Embedded Technologies Artesyn Embedded Technologies is a global leader in the design and manufacture of highly reliable power conversion and embedded computing solutions for a wide range of industries including communications, computing, medical, military, aerospace and industrial.

 Intel buys artificial intelligence startup AFP Aug. 9, 2016, 10:10 PM 11 facebook linkedin twitter email print California-based computer chip colossus Intel looks to broaden its role in data centers and the expanding internet of things © Getty/AFP/File Justin Sullivan San Francisco (AFP) - US-based Intel announced a deal to buy an artificial intelligence startup as the computer chip colossus looks to broaden its role in data centers and the expanding internet of things. Intel did not disclose how much it is paying for Nervana Systems, but US media reports on Tuesday put the price at more than $350 million. "With this acquisition, Intel is formally committing to pushing the forefront of AI (artificial intelligence) technologies," Nervana co-founder and chief executive Naveen Rao said in a blog post. "We can now shatter the old paradigm and move into a new regime of computing." Founded two years ago in Southern California, Nervana has specialized in combining hardware and software to help machines think in ways similar to human brains, according to the companies. Intel plans to put Nervana expertise to work in Xeon and Xeon Phi chips to better handle "deep learning" in the internet cloud, Intel data center group executive vice president Diane Bryant said in an online post. "While artificial intelligence is often equated with great science fiction, it isn't relegated to novels and movies," Bryant said. "AI is all around us."

This was ostensibly a move to force more users to upgrade to Windows 10, or else face the possibility of losing access to security updates. The folks in Redmond, Washington justified the move at the time, citing the “advanced” age of the operating systems. Microsoft did, however, give some of its top OEM partners a reprieve, exempting select machines from its banhammer. Needless to say, reaction from enthusiasts came swiftly and viciously. Microsoft backpedaled a bit two months later, extending the cutoff date for full support to July 17th, 2018. Microsoft also at the time announced that Skylake users would receive critical updates through the end of the extended support period for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1, which ends on January 14th, 2020 and January 10th, 2023 respectively. Microsoft is now cutting through the confusion surrounding Skylake support, and is declaring that ALL Skylake machines running Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 will be FULLY supported until the extended support period ends for each operating system. Shad Larsen, Microsoft Director of Windows Business Planning, writes: We recognize that, in some instances, customers have a few systems that require longer deployment timeframes. We listened to this feedback and today are sharing an update to our 6th Gen Intel Core (Skylake) support policy. We have extended the support period from July 17, 2018 to the end of support dates for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1; and we will provide all applicable security updates. So not only will Skylake machines running Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 receive critical updates, but they will receive ALL applicable security updates going forward. According to Microsoft, this change was made possible due to “the strong partnership with our OEM partners and Intel who will be performing security update validation testing.” However, Microsoft customers will need to be aware that newer Intel and AMD processors (i.e. Kaby Lake and Bristol Ridge) will only be supported on Windows 10. Microsoft goes on to state that “all future silicon releases will require the latest release of Windows 10.” Tags:  Intel, Microsoft, Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Skylake, (nasdaq:msft) Via:  Microsoft Show comments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Follow Us: Twitter Facebook RSS Email YouTube AppStore Google+ 85K 9K 4K 27K CONVERSATIONS Ubuntu Based Zorin OS 12 Linux Could Be...32 Netflix 4K Streaming Comes To PC, But...11 Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella Mocks Apple...9 Apple Reportedly Throttling iPhone 7...8 NVIDIA Offers Free Gears Of War 4...5 Microsoft Rumored To Include x86 on...4 Stanford Study Shows That Students Are...4 FEATURED Hot Holiday Gift Guide 2016: Tablets,...

Shortly after CES wrapped up in January Terry Myerson revealed this new plan on the official Windows blog. At that time their policy towards the Skylake chipset was to provide driver and system support to a very specific set of Skylake based devices for Windows 7 and 8.1 users. The other aspect of this new plan was to only support Windows 7 and 8.1 on those devices until 17 July 2017 which at that time was just 18 months down the road. Of course, Windows 10 was built for that type of new chipset and beyond so support for it was not considered an issue. As you might imagine, the reaction was swift and loud to the idea that Windows 7 and 8.1 would only be supported on newer devices running Skylake for just 18 months. Then just two months later in March Microsoft announced their plans to modify this support policy and adjust the end of support for Windows 7 and 8.1 running on Skylake to expire on 17 July 2018 and give organizations an extra year to make their migration over to Windows 10. They also revealed that security related fixes for Windows 7 and 8.1, which were originally due to expire at the end of this new support policy, would be made available for those systems on Skylake until the operating system end of support dates of 14 January 2020 and 10 January 2023 respectively. This was considered a pretty significant backtrack on their original announcement in January. However, the changes to this policy were not done as we learned today from Microsoft. In a new blog post on the official Windows blog site, Shad Larsen the Director of Windows Business Planning, what is hopefully the final change to this silicon support policy. He details the following key items in that article: Today Windows 7 is in extended support and support will end for Windows 7 on January 14, 2020, and support for Windows 8.1 will end January 10, 2023. 6th Gen Intel Core devices on Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 will be supported with all applicable security updates until the end of support for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. This change is made possible through the strong partnership with our OEM partners and Intel who will be performing security update validation testing and upgrade testing for 6th Gen Intel Core systems running Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 through the end of support dates. As previously communicated earlier this year, future silicon platforms including Intel’s upcoming 7th Gen Intel Core (Kaby Lake) processor family and AMD’s 7th generation processors (e.g. Bristol Ridge) will only be supported on Windows 10, and all future silicon releases will require the latest release of Windows 10. Despite extending support on these chipsets until the OS's themselves are no longer actively supported Microsoft does not want customers waiting around to migrate to Windows 10: "We recommend that customers upgrade these 6th Gen Intel Core systems on Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 as soon as possible so that they can receive full support along with the great enhancements that come from running modern hardware with modern software. Our commitment to all of our customers remains strong and we’re grateful for your ongoing support."

Roston - Aug 11, 2016 6 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Want the style and durability of a ThinkPad with the budget-friendliness and speed of a Chromebook? Enter Lenovo’s ThinkPad 13 Chromebook, a version of its ThinkPad 13 laptop that runs Google’s Chrome OS. High-end Chromebooks have become more common over the past couple years; we’ve seen such offerings from Dell, for example, and now the latest is the Thinkpad 13 Chromebook. Particularly notable with the model is the inclusion of UBS-C ports, but that’s just a small sliver of what the laptop has to offer. Is Lenovo’s Thinkpad 13 Chromebook the Chrome OS business laptop you’ve been waiting for? Read our full review to find out! Hardware The Lenovo Thinkpad 13 Chromebook looks like the expansive array of other Thinkpad laptops available, with one notable exception: the small Chrome emblem on the lid that any Chromebook user will be familiar with. That aside, you’re getting a Thinkpad is every regard when it comes to design, and that includes durability. According to Lenovo, the Thinkpad 13 Chromebook is tested to military specifications across a dozen different durability tests. The laptop is, overall, thin and light, measuring 19.8mm thin and 3.2lbs/1.4kg in weight. This is a USB-C laptop, and like many others cropping up on the market, includes two USB-C ports instead of one. Displays are often one source of complaints when it comes to Chromebooks, which is perhaps why Lenovo is offering an optional Full HD 1080p IPS display with the Thinkpad 13 Chromebook. The model I reviewed features this panel, and it is very nice to behold with crisp colors and sharp lines. This particular screen option also boasts a 180-degree viewing angle. In the future (Lenovo describes it as “soon”), you’ll also have the option of getting a touch panel. Among the laptop’s more welcoming features is the inclusion of dual noise-cancelling microphones, an arguably necessary feature for a business laptop (as impromptu Skype sessions may happen when your headset isn’t available). The Thinkpad 13 Chromebook also features a 720p high-definition webcam with face tracking and wide viewing angles. The webcam appears atypically sensitive in low-light conditions; video quality in an averagely lit office is very nice. The display, as shown in the image above, can be laid completely flat. Typing, meanwhile, is aided by two large rubber feet on the rear of the laptop, elevating it slightly to put the keyboard at a more comfortable angle. The keyboard itself is distinctly that of a Thinkpad, very comfortable to type on with a nice level of resistance and relatively silent operation. One of the nicer aspects of the Thinkpad 13 Chromebook is its level of available customization options. As you can see in the specs below, you have three different processors to choose from, a trio of display options, and more. TECH SPECS Processor: — Intel® Core™ i5-6300U Processor — Intel® Core™ i3-6100U Processor — Intel® Celeron® 3855U Processor Operating System: Chrome OS Graphics: Intel® Integrated Graphics Webcam: 720p Camera Memory: Up to 8 GB LPDDR3, 1600 MHz Storage: 16GB / 32GB EMMC Audio: 3.5 mm Combo Audio Battery: Up to 10 Hours (42 WHr) Display: — 13.3″ HD (1366 x 768) TN, 200 nits — 13.3″ FHD (1920 x 1080) IPS, 220 nits — 13.3″ FHD (1920 x 1080) IPS, Touch (coming soon) Dimensions (W x D x H): — (inches) : 12.68″ x 8.78″ x 0.78″ — (mm) : 322 x 223 x 19.8 Weight: Starting at 3.2 lbs (1.4 kg) Keyboard: Standard Keyboard MIL-SPEC: Yes – 12 Methods I/O (Input/Output) Ports: — 2 x USB 3.0 — 2 x USB Type-C — 3.5 mm Headphone / Microphone WiFi: Intel Stone Peak 7265 AC/B/G/N Bluetooth: Bluetooth 4.0 Software & Performance Because this Thinkpad is a Chromebook, our regular Geekbench benchmarks don’t apply, and most usage scenarios for the laptop aren’t going to be very demanding at all — a Chromebook is something you use to watch video, put together presentations, edit photos, check and send emails, perform general word processing activities, and maybe play a game or two during your downtime. Most people with these modest needs get a Chromebook for two reasons: they’re a low-cost way to do these simple tasks, they’re fast, and they have a long battery life. After using the Thinkpad 13 Chromebook for all of the above tasks (except putting together a presentation, alas), I can say it hits both of those goals. The battery life does indeed fall around the 10-hour figure Lenovo specifies for it, depending, of course, on how you’re using the laptop. Even running YouTube videos doesn’t drain the battery noticeably faster than just browsing the web, though, so in terms of on-the-go usage, the Thinkpad 13 is great. And, as we’d expect from a Chromebook, the Thinkpad 13 fires up quickly and is very snappy during general usage. The speeds you experience will be affected by which hardware configuration you end up siding with, of course — the model I reviewed has the i5 processor option and 8GB of RAM. Conclusion A Chromebook is a Chromebook, I’ve heard some say. They’re so simple that it all boils down to Chrome OS, and that is the same no matter which model you pick up. After using many different types of Chromebooks over the years, I can say that’s not really true. Yes, Chrome OS is Chrome OS. The Chromebook itself, though, is obviously the sum total of all of its parts, and there truly are crappy models out there. Lenovo’s Thinkpad 13 Chromebook isn’t one of them.

The obligations are scheduled for a negotiated sale the week of August 22nd. Proceeds will be used to refund outstanding debt for savings. In addition, Fitch has affirmed the following ratings at 'AAA': -- Issuer Default Rating (IDR); --$309.5 million general obligation bonds; --$201.3 million ETROs. The Rating Outlook is Stable. SECURITY ETROs are payable from a first lien on the city's excise tax revenues. The GO bonds are payable from an unlimited ad valorem tax levied against all taxable property in the city. KEY RATING DRIVERS The 'AAA' IDR and general obligation (GO) ratings are based on Chandler's exceptionally strong financial flexibility, enabled by solid expenditure flexibility and strong budget management practices supplemented by reserves, as well as its low long-term liability burden. The 'AAA' ETRO rating reflects an ample coverage cushion, strong additional bonds test of 3.0x and expectations for solid growth in the pledged revenue stream. Economic Resource Base Chandler encompasses 70 square miles in southeastern Maricopa County, with a 2015 population of approximately 260,000. Anchored by Intel Corporation, top employers represent technology, manufacturing, local government, education, financial, healthcare, and telecommunication interests. Revenue Framework: 'aaa' factor assessment Strong revenue trends and ongoing population growth and economic development support the expectation for solid revenue growth. Chandler's independent legal ability to raise operating revenues is considered high based on its capacity to raise the local sales tax rate without external approvals. Expenditure Framework: 'aa' factor assessment Chandler's natural pace of spending is in line with revenue growth. The city benefits from a voluntary 'meet and confer' process with its employee groups, contributing to expenditure flexibility. Fitch expects the city's carrying costs to remain moderate based on rapid principal amortization and limited debt plans which offset planned increases in pension contributions to facilitate prepayment of a portion of its pension liability. Long-Term Liability Burden: 'aaa' factor assessment Long-term liabilities are a low 5.8% of personal income. Fitch expects the long-term liability burden to remain low based on regional growth to support new issuances, and the city's plans to accelerate pay-off of one of its pension liabilities. Operating Performance: 'aaa' factor assessment The city has taken advantage of nonrecurring revenues and the economic upturn to build a strong financial cushion. Fitch expects Chandler to demonstrate strong financial resilience through a moderate economic downturn based on its current high reserve level, revenue-raising capacity and solid expenditure flexibility. RATING SENSITIVITIES Financial Flexibility: The 'AAA' rating is sensitive to shifts in fundamental credit characteristics, most notably the city's ongoing strong financial flexibility and solid economic growth. CREDIT PROFILE Strong employment growth trends reflect Chandler's participation in the broad-based Phoenix area economy. Intel Corporation employs approximately 11,000 (about 8% of Chandler's employment base). However, the city's success in attracting and retaining top technology, manufacturing, advanced business and health services continues to widen and diversify the employment base. The city's low unemployment rate continues to trend below regional and U.S. averages. A highly educated and skilled workforce contributes to the city's low unemployment and attractive growth prospects; income and wealth trends are well above average. Chandler's local economy continues to expand as evidenced by the 15% compound annual growth of its ad valorem tax base since fiscal 2013 due to new industrial, commercial, and residential development, as well as property appreciation. Revenue Framework The city's local sales tax or transaction privilege tax (TPT) collections contributed 52% of fiscal 2015 general fund revenues, followed by state shared revenues (28%). Ad valorem property tax revenues contributed only 3% to revenues. Chandler's general fund revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the past 10 years of 2.6% exceeds inflation, but falls short of U.S. GDP, reflecting significant exposure to economically sensitive revenues during the Great Recession. Subsequent to the recession (fiscal 2011 through 2015), Chandler realized a healthy general fund revenue CAGR of 4.1%. Fitch's expectation for solid growth considers the city's current expansion as well as its exposure to economically sensitive revenues. By virtue of its status as a TPT non-program city, Chandler retains the independent legal capacity to change its own TPT rate, currently at 1.5%, without limit. The city's sales tax rate is competitive and its long-range plan does not include a TPT rate increase based on the expectation of moderate ongoing growth in the sales tax base, consistent with current trends. Expenditure Framework Public safety represents Chandler's largest governmental cost of service, accounting for just over 50% of operating costs. The city's natural pace of spending is expected to track closely with revenue growth. Chandler achieves expenditure flexibility through discretion over headcount, salaries and work rules within the framework of meet and confer agreements the city has in place with its employee groups. The city tapped this flexibility during the last recession by initiating a hiring freeze, voluntary separation and retirement incentives and vacant position eliminations. Additional flexibility is maintained through the city's moderate carrying costs, 16.9% of fiscal 2015 spending. Fitch expects the city's carrying costs to remain moderate based on a rapid 10-year 85% amortization rate and limited debt plans which offset a planned uptick in pension contributions for the scheduled paydown of the city's Public Safety Personnel Retirement System (PSPRS) net pension liabilities (NPLs). Long-Term Liability Burden Chandler's long-term liability burden of $448 million (including overall debt and direct pension liabilities) is low at 5.8% of personal income and is expected to remain low based on moderate area debt needs, an expanding economic base and the city's management of its unfunded pension liabilities. Chandler's fiscal 2017 budget includes $592 million in projected capital spending over the next five years, $313 million for municipal utilities, $164 million for transportation, and $115 million for general government, parks & recreation, and public safety. Funding sources include impact fees, current revenues, grants, tax-supported debt and enterprise user fee-supported debt. The city routinely conducts bi-annual GO and excise tax revenue debt sales. Under GASB 67 and 68, the city reports a fiscal 2015 Arizona State Retirement System (ASRS) NPL of $105.7 million, with fiduciary assets covering 69.5% of total pension liabilities at the plan's 8% investment return assumption (approximately 63% based on a lower 7% investment rate assumption). The NPL for the city's PSPRS police and fire plans are $73 million and $36 million, respectively, with fiduciary assets covering a low 58.7% of total police plan and 66% of fire plan pension liabilities at the plan's 7.85% investment return assumption (approximately 53.7% and 60.3% based on a lower 7% investment rate assumption). Notably, the city's fiscal 2015 budget included annual contributions in excess of the actuarially determined contribution to achieve pay-off of the unfunded liabilities within the 10-year planning horizon. Additionally, proposed legislation provides modest PSPRS reforms applicable to new hires and eliminates the automatic cost of living adjustments currently in place which Fitch anticipates could, if implemented, improve long-term plan sustainability. Operating Performance Fitch expects Chandler to maintain its exceptionally strong financial resilience during a moderate economic downturn, benefiting from its very high current level of reserves, strong independent legal ability to raise revenues without external approval, and solid expenditure flexibility. Chandler estimates completing fiscal 2016 with a strong financial cushion approximating that of fiscal 2015. The city's five-year budget incorporates reserve applications for capital projects and accelerated paydown of its PSPRS unfunded pension liability, but maintains reserves in excess of its four-month of revenue target, commensurate with a 'aaa' operating performance assessment. Chandler typically outperforms its conservative budget and replenishes reserves during times of economic expansion and with nonrecurring revenues to apply to capital and strategic applications. Excise Tax Revenue Bonds Excise tax revenues include local sales tax or transaction privilege tax (TPT), state shared revenues (reflecting a two-year lag in distributions), franchise fees, licenses and permits, and fines and forfeitures. ETROs fund the city's water and waste water system improvements and these system revenues support ETRO debt service. Excise tax revenue collections reflect strong 3.8% CAGR from 2004-2014 and growth prospects remain strong. Legal provisions provide solid bondholder protections. These include an additional bonds test (ABT) of 3.0x maximum annual debt service (MADs) using an historical test for bonds outstanding plus bonds to be issued. To evaluate the sensitivity of the dedicated revenue stream to cyclical decline, Fitch considers both revenue sensitivity results (using a 1% decline in national GDP scenario) and the largest decline in revenues over the period covered by the revenue sensitivity analysis. Based on the city's 15-year pledged revenue history, Fitch's analytical sensitivity tool (FAST) generates a 2.6% scenario decline in pledged revenues. The largest actual cumulative decline in historical revenues is a 16.5% decline from fiscal 2009-2011, reflecting sensitivity of sales and state shared revenues to the economic downturn. Assuming issuance up to the 3.0x ABT, well below actual current coverage, debt service would be covered with more than a 60% drop in revenues, 25x the scenario results and 4.0x the largest actual revenue decline in the review period. This level of resilience is consistent with a 'AAA' rating (noting additionally that the fiscal 2009-2011 performance reflected a housing bust that disproportionately affected the Arizona economy to an extent that Fitch believes is less likely to be repeated in the future). Fiscal 2015 pledged revenues of $170 million are up for the fourth consecutive year and cover MADS (2029) a high 8.65x. Projections which include the addition of a $100 million ETRO issuance in fiscal 2017 indicate that ETRO MADs coverage from pledged excise tax revenues will continue to provide a financial cushion commensurate with the current rating. Issuing Entity Exposure The special tax bond rating is limited by the city of Chandler's IDR ('AAA') as Fitch does not believe that the security insulates the bonds from the general credit of the issuer. Fitch does not view the pledged excise tax revenues as special revenues under section 902(2) (B) of the bankruptcy code, which defines 'special excise taxes imposed on particular activities or transactions' as special revenues.

GIGABYTE launched two new high-end motherboards at Computex, the Z170X-Ultra Gaming, and the Z170X-Designare. Both motherboards are targeted towards the two largest subsets of Z170 buyers; gamers and power users. The Z170X-Ultra Gaming differs from most of GIGABYTE's previous Z170 gaming products. It has a neutral color look, it has metal shielding instead of plastic, it features U.2, and it carries some of GIGABYTE's newer features such as 100W USB Type-C support.     The Z170X-Ultra Gaming is basically a refreshed Z170 motherboard with the latest features. Its color theme is worth noting because many users had asked for more color-neutral motherboards. If users decide to disable the red LEDs, then the motherboard will be all black with some hints of silver. If they decide to leave the LEDs on, then a very red color theme with diffused LEDs will appear, and it doesn't look half bad.   Let's take a closer look at the Z170X-Ultra Gaming.     Specifications     The GIGABYTE Z170X-Ultra Gaming has a lot of high-end features, including Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1, U.2, M.2 (32Gb/s), USB 3.0, and SATA 6Gb/s.     Pricing   The Z170X-Ultra Gaming is available from many large retailers for roughly $170.

Kyle Raines told Sputnik on Thursday. © AP Photo/ Susan Walsh CENTCOM Ties With Intel Chief Could Result in Obama Receiving Distorted DataWASHINGTON (Sputnik) — The report made public on Thursday revealed that CENTCOM manipulated intelligence reports and public statements on the fight against Daesh terrorist group to portray events on the ground as being more positive than they were. “US Central Command has seen the Congressional Joint Task Force initial report and we appreciate the independent oversight provided,” Raines said. “We are reviewing the findings of the initial report; since the Joint Task Force investigation is ongoing, as is the DOD IG's [Department of Defense Inspector General] investigation, we will refrain from further comment at this time.” House of Representatives committees convened the task force after a whistleblower claimed in May 2015 that CENTCOM leaders were engineering intelligence products to present an unjustly positive outlook on US efforts to train Iraqi Security Forces and fight Daesh. Additionally, CENTCOM press releases, statements and testimony in front of the US Congress were significantly more positive than the events on the ground, the Joint Task Force explained. Despite the whistleblower complaint, neither CENTCOM nor the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence took steps to improve the analytic problems, the report pointed out. The Joint Task Force along with the US Department of Defense is continuing to investigate the whistleblower allegations, and the findings are only preliminary, the report stated. ...

This is the newest release in NoviFlow’s industry leading high-performance OpenFlow 1.3/1.4/1.5 switching software for use in switches, WAN IP/MPLS routers, network appliances and other high-performance forwarding planes. The software is deployed around the world in NoviFlow’s NoviSwitch products and is also offered via software license to OEM and ODM switching platform suppliers. NoviWare 400 consists of all the software necessary for a pure-play OpenFlow switch, and currently supports Mellanox NP-4 and NP-5 network processors and Intel or PowerPC host CPUs. According to Dominique Jodoin, president and CEO of NoviFlow: “Whether deployed in NoviFlow’s NoviSwitch products, or integrated as part of our OEM customers’ own offering, NoviWare is providing a real high-performance software solution for OpenFlow enabled switches, routers and other network appliances. We are pleased that our network processor-based switches and software are becoming key elements in the deployment of scalable, robust, and high-demand SDN, cloud, and Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) solutions.” NoviWare 400 provides the industry’s broadest support of the OpenFlow 1.3 and 1.4 specifications, including all actions, instructions and match fields. It has also been extended to support key OpenFlow 1.5 features such as the highly anticipated Copy-Fields action, as well as other new features that significantly boost the performance of OpenFlow based applications, such as a hashing function on user-defined ordered lists, MPLS payload matching and broader encapsulation/decapsulation support for layer 2 tunneling protocols. In order to offer the Copy-Fields action to existing customers who do not have the option of using OpenFlow 1.5, NoviFlow has implemented the Copy-Field action on as an OpenFlow Experimenter action to offer SDN applications this functionality with OpenFlow 1.3, 1.4 AND 1.5 controllers. Key features of NoviWare 400 include: Implements all required and optional OpenFlow 1.3/1.4 match fields (41 of 41) and instructions (6 of 6) as well as 59 out of 60 actions and basic support of OF 1.5 (Copy-Fields action) Linux-based NoviWare host CPU software for PowerPC or Intel i7 Multiple OpenFlow Controllers and Controller role-changes Support for OpenFlow pipeline processing with up to 120 flow tables, with up to 1 million wildcard match flow table entries in TCAM and up to 15 million exact match flow entries in DRAM OpenFlow queues and meters for implementation of QoS mechanisms Extensive O&M features optimized for large scale deployment of OpenFlow switches in carrier, cloud and enterprise networks OpenFlow Experimenter-based extensions: - L2-L7 matching, packet processing and flow management - Experimenter action for Hash on user-defined ordered list of OpenFlow fields. Can be used to load balance in Select Group (all products) and in LAG (2000 Series only) or in the copy-field action - Copy-Field action based on OF1.5 also supported on OF1.3 to 1.5 through OpenFlow Experimenter action - Experimenter MPLS payload matching - L2 GRE/GTP/VxLAN/MPLS tunneling protocol encapsulation/decapsulation - BFD Link Monitoring Says Jodoin: “NoviWare 400 provides a smooth path to using OpenFlow 1.5 capabilities without requiring that existing solutions be upgraded to OpenFlow 1.5 Controllers. It continues NoviFlow’s proven track record of delivering the most advanced OpenFlow capabilities available in the market while protecting existing OpenFlow investments, and is being deployed with confidence in commercial networks around the world.” NoviWare 400 is shipping now. NoviFlow will demonstrate its advanced OpenFlow solutions at its booth at the SDN World Congress in the Hague, Netherlands, October 10 [th] to 14 [th] , 2016.

Now Google DeepMind, Blizzard train AIs with StarCraft battles AI boffins turn to StarCraft to train future neural networks Accessories to crime: Facial recog defeated by wacky paper glasses Intel’s latest Diversity and Inclusion mid-year report shows that numbers of African American and Hispanic people have hardly changed, despite the company’s $300m pledge to achieve full representation by 2020. Although the number of female workers have slowly been rising – especially for those in more senior roles – the same cannot be said for a group Intel calls "under-represented minorities". The percentage of African American workers went up from December 2015 to June 2016 only 0.2 per cent, from 3.5 to 3.7 per cent. For Native Americans - the most under-represented minority - the figure was bumped up a mere 0.1 per cent, from 0.5 to 0.6 per cent. But for Hispanics, the percentage dropped 0.4 per cent. In December 2014, the figure started at 8.3 per cent and rose a year later by 0.1 per cent, but in June it fell to 8 per cent. Broken down by career levels, the number of under-represented minorities in senior roles has grown. The biggest jump seen from December 2014 to June 2016 was for leadership roles, which rose from 4.8 to 6.9 per cent. During the same period, however, the overall percentage of under-represented minorities (12.3 per cent), remained unchanged. Intel’s CEO, Brian Krzanich, announced the company’s Diversity in Technology Initiative in 2015. It made Chipzilla the first major technology company to aim for full representation of women and under-represented minorities by 2020 by investing $300m to hire and retain more employees. “We’re calling on our industry to again make the seemingly impossible possible by making a commitment to real change and clarity in our goals,” said Krzanich. “Without a workforce that more closely mirrors the population, we are missing opportunities, including not understanding and designing for our own customers.” But Intel’s latest figures show the company is far from its goals. According to CIA Fact Book, the American population is 12.85 per cent black, 4.43 per cent Asian, and Amerindian and Alaska native 0.97 per cent, and native Hawaiian and other Pacific islander 0.18 per cent. The lack of diversity is an issue recognised by many major tech companies. In June, 30 companies, including Intel, GitHub and VMWare signed a Tech Inclusion Pledge, a commitment to the White House to publish diversity figures and implement goals to increase representation in their companies. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 24 Comments More from The Register Google gently leads Intel into its cloud: This is for your own good All is well, rejoice, rejoice, let's get into the white 'n' fluffy Intel mulls sale of Intel Security – reports Opinion The game done changed 6 Comments Intel is shipping an ARM-based FPGA.

Taking a page from Intel and Micron's strategy book, they also announced a new memory type and corresponding SSD product while saying essentially nothing about what the new memory actually is. Gallery: Samsung 4th Generation V-NAND The fourth generation 3D NAND bumps the layer count up to 64, compared to the 48-layer design used by the third generation V-NAND that was announced last fall and has been slowly rolling out to their SSD products over the course of this year. So far Samsung has talked about a 512Gb TLC part, and at least initially the MLC parts will probably be made from the same die and thus have two thirds the capacity. (Samsung's second generation 3D NAND was initially available as 128Gb TLC or 86Gb MLC, with 128Gb MLC parts introduced later.) The new NAND also supports an increased interface speed of 800Mbps, which is key to reducing the performance penalty that comes from consolidating more flash onto fewer independent chips. With a per-die capacity of 512Gb (64GB), Samsung can now put 1TB of TLC flash in a single package. This means most product lines will be seeing an increase in capacity at the high end of the range. Their BGA SSD products will be offering 1TB capacity even in the 11.5mm by 13mm form factor. The 16TB PM1633a SAS SSD will be eclipsed by the new 32TB PM1643. Likely to be further out, the PM1725 PCIe add-in card SSD will be succeeded by the PM1735 with a PCIe 4 x8 host interface. Complementing the NAND update will be a new non-standard oversized M.2 form factor 32mm wide and 114mm long, compared to the typical enterprise M.2 size of 22mm by 110mm. A little extra room can go a long way, and Samsung will be using it to produce 8TB drives. These will be enterprise SSDs and Samsung showed a diagram of these enabling 256TB of flash in a 1U server. Samsung will also be producing 4TB drives in standard M.2 sizing. Gallery: Samsung Z-NAND and Z-SSD In what is likely a bid to steal some thunder from 3D XPoint memory before it can ship, Samsung announced Z-NAND memory technology and a Z-SSD product based around Z-NAND and a new SSD controller. They said nothing about the operating principles of Z-NAND, but they did talk about their plans for the Z-SSD products. Samsung Z-SSD is being marketed as addressing the performance gap between DRAM and SSDs. Samsung's slides during their keynote showed some performance comparisons against the PM963 NVMe TLC SSD and against an unnamed "PRAM based" solution. The logical point of comparison would be against 3D XPoint NVMe drives, but Samsung can't have real performance and power numbers on those when they're still under development by Intel and Micron. Thus the PRAM based solution Samsung refers to is probably one of their own earlier R&D efforts that didn't make it to market. The Z-SSD ties or comes out ahead on every benchmark Samsung showed, but NVMe NAND flash SSDs were missing from the power consumption comparison. The slides stated that there will be a 1TB Z-SSD this year and 2TB and 4TB Z-SSDs next year, while the press release issued later states that more generally that the Z-SSD is expected to be released next year. The press release also states that Z-NAND "shares the fundamental structure of V-NAND and has a unique circuit design and controller that can maximize performance". Given that, the launch timeframe and capacities that are only a little lower than NAND flash SSDs, it seems that Z-NAND isn't drastically different from existing memory technologies and it may even be little more than SLC flash in disguise, trying for a comeback.

On the consumer end, that is. Reply ImSpartacus - Thursday, August 11, 2016 - link Yeah, I don't see much changing there except a steady march to the bottom. All these are pro/high end products. Reply name99 - Friday, August 12, 2016 - link Consumer is a big space. Are Apple products consumer? Because they're a possible target for this sort of thing. (Depending on how Intel prices XPoint, however, THAT may be enterprise only for two or three years.) Reply plopke - Thursday, August 11, 2016 - link The more I see from Optane , QuantX , Z-SSD,... the more I wonder what the benefit is for mainstream consumer products , to expensive, coming as a cache system for consumer enthusiastic people which can buy 16/32GB DDR4 quiet cheap + very quick SSDs instead of spending money on this. But on enterprise level will be fun to watch how this all evolves. Reply lefty2 - Thursday, August 11, 2016 - link I don't think anyone ever said that they have benefit for mainstream consumer products. It's mainly for enterprise and enthusiast markets. Also, Samsung only talks about performance. 3D X-point is 1000 times more longativity than normal NAND and that factor is just as important as the performance. So, what's the longativity of Z-Nand? Reply plopke - Thursday, August 11, 2016 - link You are right , guess Intel is the only one who might pitch this to consumers atm. Reply ddriver - Thursday, August 11, 2016 - link Well, if it is indeed SLC, then it could handle 100k+ p/e cycles. That's a LOT more than MLC flash. SLC's problem was low capacity, which samsung can solve by stacking dies into a single package. I am surprised they took so long, but then again, it is not as cost effective as MLC and TLC stacking, so it makes sense they didn't do it for consumer drives, but now that the enterprise market is gearing for a transition to flash and with xpoint on the horizon, the fat profit margins of the enterprise market have made stacking SLC very viable. Reply bcronce - Thursday, August 11, 2016 - link 3D VAND TLC has between 10k and 70k p/e cycles, depending on if they optimize the firmware for speed or durability. I haven't heard how many cycles SLC 3D VNAND has, I assume more. The main point is modern MLC can have about the same amount of cycles as last gen SLC. Reply ats - Thursday, August 11, 2016 - link This is completely false on so many levels. Modern NAND and 3D NAND has significantly LESS real endurance than NAND from 5-10 years ago. What you are actually seeing are advances in redundancy and error correction codes. Those old numbers for say 50/40nm flash were RAW P/E cycles. You could hook the flash up to any interface and it would give at least those numbers of P/E cycles. What is being quoted for modern flash is not RAW P/E values but calculated P/E values assuming a certain redundancy and a certain level of error correction (generally quite complex taking microseconds to compute). Reply frenchy_2001 - Thursday, August 11, 2016 - link Nope. What has happened is that 3D NAND took multiple steps back in XY lithography and then went 3D (up) and stacked layers. So, recent 3D NAND are back on the 40nm process (instead of 16nm process for planar NAND). This gives them *MUCH* bigger cells, thicker walls and as such, better endurance. Process improvements helped too. Basically, 3D NAND is back to RAW p/e cycles superior to what we had in the past, just due to cell size. On top of that, they now have better error correction and better wear leveling and controllers. This is why even TLC in 3D NAND has decent endurance.

We have worked to get Sandia National Laboratories to help get small businesses started with the labs’ technologies. We hoped Intel would be the basis of a cluster of local semiconductor companies. We watch the University of New Mexico license its technologies to local entrepreneurs, then hope those entrepreneurs will build a locally controlled company of some meaningful scale. We’ve done this for many reasons: We want an economy where our kids can find good jobs; tech companies pay better; tech companies are usually less polluting than traditional manufacturers; tech companies grow faster and employ more people over time; tech companies tend to spawn more tech companies. A new study from the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution says Albuquerque has a long way to go to create that new economy. In fact, the study shows we’re losing ground. Advertisement Continue reading Brookings identified 50 industries in manufacturing, energy and services that spend at least $450 per worker per year on research and development and employ at least 20 percent of their workforces in STEM-intensive occupations (STEM stands for science, technology, engineering and mathematics). Then for the nation’s 100 largest metropolitan areas, Brookings calculated how many workers are employed in those industries, how much they earn and how important those industries are to the local economy. Brookings found that employment in what it calls advanced industries in Albuquerque declined 1.4 percent from 2010 to 2013 and grew not at all from 2013 through 2015. The output of those industries declined 0.6 percent from 2010 to 2013 and declined 2.3 percent from 2013 to 2015. Nationally, output grew 2.7 percent from 2013 through 2015, and employment grew 2.46 percent. Albuquerque ranked 99th among the nation’s 100 largest metropolitan areas in the growth of its advanced industries’ output and 85th in employment growth. The industries employ 38,400 people in the Albuquerque area and generated $6.2 billion worth of output in 2015. They pay an average annual salary of $76,889, compared with an average of $45,221 for all industries in the Albuquerque area. Mark Muro, who directs Brookings’ Metropolitan Policy Program, really can’t explain it. “Albuquerque remains a puzzling case, in some ways, and sure has been having a difficult time across multiple measures of post-crisis recovery,” Muro said in a email exchange with the Journal. “It does seem to lack dynamism.” Albuquerque has experienced some growth in computer systems design, web search services and data processing. Precision instruments, miscellaneous manufacturing, medical equipment and pharmaceuticals are “growing a bit or gaining momentum,” Muro said. But these industries don’t employ that many people. Looking at larger employers, “the region is getting less engineering growth than most places, and semiconductors had a rough two years. Meanwhile, your largest industry – R&D services – added employment but not at a rapid pace. Perhaps this is reflective of slow federal budget increases, since the state is heavily tied to federal funding flows.” Advertisement Continue reading Another Brookings study, published two years ago, says there are several impediments to our long-held hope that the national laboratories in New Mexico would help our advanced industries grow. Brookings found that “despite their undeniable potential, most national labs appear to contribute only marginally to the build-out and dynamism of their regions’ local innovation clusters.” Sandia and Los Alamos national laboratories are primarily weapons labs that “remain at present too mission-focused and too little incentivized to plunge deeply into their respective regional economies.” The labs have “a heritage of defense activity” that has “created a culture within the labs that is occasionally still resistant to collaboration” with local business, according to Brookings. The labs’ bureaucracy and time-consuming contracting processes are difficult for small businesses to navigate and are too costly for most small businesses to endure, Brookings reported. To the difficulties Brookings identified, add the risk of starting a new business, the difficulty of finding the investment to start a tech company and the dearth of local business talent to take technology to market and you get an idea of why growth of advanced industries in Albuquerque is so slow.

More and more big companies are creating their own venture investment arms Thu, Aug 11, 2016, 06:15 Updated: Thu, Aug 11, 2016, 17:24 Karlin Lillington An exhibitor stand at the Web Summit in Dublin in 2015: the fundraising landcsape for start-ups is generally a hazardous strip of prickly land running between a rock and hard place . Photograph: Eric Luke         Investment into technology startups from corporate venture capital (CVCs) continues in a steady rise, as more established companies create venture arms.  CVC units are special divisions within companies such as Cisco, Google and Intel – but also, non-tech sector companies in varied sectors, such as General Mills and NBC Sports – that invest into young companies, providing an alternative funding source.   Why do they invest? Reasons are varied, but perhaps the most frequently cited is that they provide a fast way into understanding or expanding into a promising sector or application of technology, compared to setting up a dedicated in-house R&D project from scratch. And of course, they can provide investment returns – or losses – to the CVC parent company.  CVCs have been around for a while, and haven’t always had a great reputation, in particular during the dotcom era, when many rushed in to make hallucinatory mega-deals, then rushed away in panic after the dotcom crash, some never to return. (Though to be fair, some mainstream VCs and many individual investors were scorched and followed suit.)  CVC investment dropped from a high of 16 per cent of all deals in 2000 to about half that level, for the remainder of the decade. But it has been back on a gradual rise and just hit an all-time high in the first quarter of this year, at 21 per cent. A report out this week from New York-based venture analyst CB Insights also notes that while the overall number of deals in the first half of 2016 fell slightly – by 6 per cent, to 633 – compared to the same period last year, and is at a nine-quarter low, the dollar value of those deals rose 3 per cent to $12.7 billion.  Record levels CVCs were involved in about 20 per cent of all deals in the first half of this year, and participation has ranged at 19 per cent and above over the past eight quarters. ADVERTISEMENT  In addition, the number of companies with new, active CVC units is on track to reach record levels this year, with 53 making their first investment so far in 2016. Active CVC units have more than doubled in number in the past four years. In the first quarter of 2012, 85 were making deals. In the same quarter of 2016, 188 were on the scene investing.  Globally, CVC deals are also larger than the average VC deal, and this has held true now for 14 quarters in a row. To give an example, in Q1 of this year, CVCs made $27 million in global investments, compared to $16 million from regular VCs. In Q2, the numbers were $19 million v $13 million, respectively.  European deals made up 19 per cent of all CVC investments in Q2 of this year, a five-quarter high.  And CVCs put most of their money into early-stage investments. CVC seed-stage investments are set to hit a new high this year, and 46 per cent of all deals are in seed, angel or series A rounds – which would seem to be a good thing for startups.  Is it? Some think no, perhaps most famously Fred Wilson of the venture capital firm Union Square Ventures, who has been scathing about CVCs for years. He now avoids deals involving any CVCs, which he refers to as “the devil”. A few years ago, in one interview at a Pando Daily event, he said he believed corporates should be buying companies, not investing in them. He did single out a few exceptions such as the venture arms at Google and Intel, which he believes function to a higher standard. On the other hand, such a view is perhaps not astonishing given it comes from a-high profile VC in a major venture firm which competes against CVCs for deals. Expertise The attractions of of a CVC investment for a young company, on the other hand, are that investment terms are generally not as onerous as they can be from mainstream VCs. And depending on the CVC, a young company can get high-level business advice and broad business expertise that VCs may not have the time, interest or ability to provide.  In addition, VCs are often looking at a fast exit and shareholder return, not the longer term possibilities of a company. CVCs, by contrast, may be more interested in developing the company, typically with an eventual direct acquisition in mind.  But that creates issues, too. Young companies can be tainted by the association with a CVC, finding it hard to find other investors or buyers when the market assumption is that the CVC parent will acquire them. Young companies may find it awkward to even discuss funding or acquisition issues at board level, given that the CVC will often hold a board position.   Plenty to think about for start-ups, which learn all too quickly that the fundraising landcsape is generally a hazardous strip of prickly land running between a rock and hard place.       Topics: Fred Wilson Union Square Ventures General Mills Cisco Intel Cvc Google United States Read More Apple’s difficulty could be rival Samsung’s opportunity Raising start-up finance is full of risks and challenges Sincere venture capitalist wanted – honesty and GSOH essential Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Financial Services 1:10 First-time buyer deposits cut to 10% as Central Bank eases mortgage rules Technology Clever cube makes for easier shared viewing English Soccer Ex-England player David White reveals sexual abuse by coach Business Pharmacist taking skincare back to its natural source Sponsored A bank-beating foreign exchange proposition How ‘nudge theory’ can improve pension provision Black Friday: what is it and how to prepare for it Send an AdMailer Christmas card and help a homeless charity ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Commenting on The Irish Times has changed.

News & Analysis Samsung Debuts 3D XPoint Killer 3D NAND variant stakes out high-end SSDs Rick Merritt 8/11/2016 00:01 AM EDT 5 comments NO RATINGS 1 saves Login to Rate Tweet SANTA CLARA, Calif. – Samsung lobbed a new variant of its 3D NAND flash into the gap Intel and Micron hope to fill with their emerging 3D XPoint memory. The news came one day after Micron showed at the Flash Memory Summit performance figures for its version of the XPoint solid-state drives (SSDs) under a new Quantx brand. Samsung announced plans for what it called Z-NAND chips that will power SSDs with similar performance but lower costs and risk than the 3D XPoint drives. However, it was secretive about the details of the technology that will appear in products sometime next year. By contrast, a Micron engineer leading its XPoint SSD program was surprisingly candid in an interview with EE Times. She described current prototypes using early XPoint chips and an FPGA-based controller for the SSDs expected to ship in about a year. Samsung’s Z-NAND will deliver 10x faster reads than multi-level cell flash and writes that are twice as fast, the company said. At the drive level, they will support both reads and writes at about 20 microseconds, suggesting some of write performance comes from an enhanced controller. The Z-SSD throughput in I/O operations/second (IOPS) will be “comparable to the new Micron Quantx products,” peaking at a desirably low level of about eight queue levels, said Tien Shiah, a Samsung product marketer who said results were based on working hardware in the lab. The first drives will have a terabyte capacity. Like today’s high-end SSDs they will draw a full 25W from a PCIe Gen 3 slot to deliver maximum IOPS. Costs will be “a little bit more than standard triple-level cell flash shipping today, but it will be more cost effective than alternative memory technologies,” said Shiah, in a nod to 3D Xpoint. Engineers from Toshiba and SanDisk interviewed independently by EE Times said they believe Z-NAND is a clever implementation in a 3D NAND process of single-level flash cells.  Shiah said Z-NAND will have “SLC-like endurance.” Samsung does not appear to have a version of Z-NAND available for NVDIMM boards that plug into a memory bus. However Intel suggests it will not attack that opportunity with XPoint until sometime well after the first SSDs emerge next year. Z-SSDs claim latency (top) and performance levels that rival 3D XPoint drives. (Images: Samsung) Samsung’s move appears to be a somewhat hastily-prepared but savvy one. It positions an existing, relatively low cost technology against a newer riskier one still trying to yield. One analyst expects Intel and Micron may take a loss on initial XPoint products until volumes rise. Intel may try to recoup the loss by selling XPoint as part of a platform with more expensive processors. “It’s a gamble,” said Jim Handy of market watcher Objective Analysis (Los Gatos, Calif.). Samsung positioned Z-NAND as a sort of special case, a defensive move outside its main flash road map. Its next major product will be a 512-Gbit chip with 64-layers delivering 800 Mbits/second, said Jae Jeong, head of Samsung’s memory division. Samsung showed at its booth a wafer bearing the chips it said will ship later this year. It will use the chips to put a terabyte of storage into a novel fan-out package developed internally, he said. The chips will be used to double to 32 TBytes the density of Samsung’s high-end SAS-based SSDs. Next page: Micron gives peek at XPoint SSD Samsung showed a prototype Z-SSD at its booth.

IMFT has taken a big hit in their credibility to execute on schedule. The hole is large enough that it has allowed Samsung to roll out an entirely new product family through it - and almost thanking IMFT for doing such a great job at pioneering the market definition for them. Strategists on both sides of IMFT clearly did not reason the probabilities of this scenario occurring and greatly underestimated Samsung's R&D ability to respond in a timely fashion.  Samsung's new device has 20 uS balanced R/Ws which is music to the ears of those architecting high performance AFAs and NVDIMM-type Ps for the burgeoning In-Memory Computing market. Byte Addressability might be used by IMFT as a counter argument but the first law of semiconductor memory business; "Price will always be the deciding factor" will take the air out of that argument. The idea of using a "intelligent" prefetch mechanism to load the on-DIMM DRAM "cache" will further help remove a good deal of latency of the on-DIMM SSD.  This is a near perfect marriage of the new found need for "terabytes" on the memory channel to satisfy the demands of In-Memory Compute Configured servers realizing that a great deal of the initial market uptake consists of an installed base. Z-NAND is an equal opportunity market share thief operating in a tier where reliably high profit margins still exist.

Other than that it might even be considered by some to be a positive, increasing noise margin of the high resistance state. I think the real problem for the threshold switch matrix isolation device is the first switching voltage of the as deposited un-switched virgin amorphous material. Experience suggests the first switching voltage will be significantly higher than the normal operating voltage. Perhaps Intel/Micron have found a way of depositing the active material of the matrix isolation device is exactly the same state as it is after it has been threshold switched for the first time. As I am sure you are aware the reason the memory material is deposited in its crystalline state is to avoid the high first switching voltage.

It would be very interesting to know if these media instabilities relate to the matrix isolation device or the memory. Are the causes of these 3DXpoint instabilities related to the same old PCM problems of element separation or thermal effects, like dissipation, crosstalk and drift or new ones from the matrix isolation device or even the "new recipe memory material? A little more clarity from Intel/Micron on those points would make it a little easier to judge if January 2017 is a reasonable date for their "hopes" to be realised. The 70/30 read/ write ratio in their demonstration would suggest the threshold switch matrix isolation device is getting quite a pounding, that is if they actually threshold switch it on every read operation.

The refreshed version of the Surface Book is said to come with the new Intel Kaby Lake processor which would be able to support USB 3.1 connections. The new processor will also be accompanied by a new graphics card capable of 3D and 4K graphics, according to Windows Central. Although Windows Central did not specifically hear that the Intel Kaby Lake processor will be added, its sources did indicate updated internal components. In terms of design, this new iteration of the Surface Book will be directly addressing one of the major gripes that consumers had with the original Surface Book: the fulcrum hinge. When the original Surface Book was first revealed, it impressed a lot of people in terms of build quality since Microsoft used metal for its body. However, the fulcrum hinge that connects the tablet/display onto the keyboard bothered a lot of users. When users closed the Surface Book, the fulcrum hinge doesn’t close it all the way like in traditional laptops. A gap between the display and the keyboard is present when the laptop is closed which kind of ruined the look of the device. Windows Central’s source indicated that Microsoft is planning to completely remove that gap on the refreshed version of the Surface Book, so that when it is closed it looks more like a traditional laptop. There are no details yet on how Microsoft will be able to do that redesign without compromising the functionality of the fulcrum hinge. Related Stories Did Microsoft Delay Windows 10 Mobile Anniversary Update? Microsoft Slashes Xbox One Price Meanwhile, Microsoft is also expected to announce a Surface AIO PC which will be intended to be placed in the living room. Sources say that the Surface AIO will come in 21, 24 and 27-inch screen sizes. The 21-inch model is believed to come with a full HD 1080p screen resolution, while the 24 and 27-inch models are said to come with 4K resolution displays. There’s no confirmation yet if Microsoft is planning to sell all three models. It is quite possible that the company is simply testing out three versions of the new Surface AIO. When Microsoft announces the Surface AIO PC, the company could simply announce two models instead of three. Microsoft previously announced that it would be releasing a new Surface-branded device for this year and another three in 2017, as pointed out by The Verge. There’s no concrete evidence to confirm what Microsoft intends to release first, but a 2017 release date for the Surface Book 2 seems more likely. Intel is expected to release the Kaby Lake processors before the end of 2016, according to Tech Radar. Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Samsung’s unreleased Exynos 8895 chip is reportedly reaching speeds of 4GHz Refreshed Surface Book could revamp fulcrum hinge, Surface ‘All-in-One in the works Patrick O'Rourke August 10, 2016 9:00pm With the fall looking ever closer, it’s almost time for another Surface line refresh. According to a report stemming from Windows Central, the new version of the Surface Book will feature Intel’s Kaby Lake processor, though the new silicon won’t start shipping until late 2016. The laptop-tablet hybrid will also feature USB 3.1, some form of updated independent graphics architecture and a 4K screen. Most interestingly, however, the Book’s fulcrum hinge, which worked great on a practical level, but wasn’t exactly aesthetically pleasing, is in store for a redesign, moving the display flush with its keyboard, adopting a look and feel similar to that of a standard laptop. In terms of the Surface Pro 5, little is known so far, though All About Microsoft’s Mary Jo Foley says her sources indicate the device will be announced this fall with a ship date only a few weeks later. It’s predicted that the Surface Pro 4 refresh will feature Intel’s Kaby Lake architecture, similar to the Surface Book, and a 4K screen, though it’s possible Microsoft could be saving UHD for its higher-end Book. A third mystery Surface device, which we reported on last month, featuring either a 21-inch 1080p display, 24-inch 4K screen or 27-inch 4K glass, could also be revealed. This new desktop device, rumoured to be called the Surface All-in-One, is designed to work in your living room, though little is known about the often-rumoured device. Rumours indicate that is the All-in-One does get a commercial release, it likely won’t be in 2016. The same can be said about the often-rumoured Surface Phone. SourceWindows Central, All About Microsoft Jon Duke Apple, take notes. Refresh your products! Microsoft is the best. Raj Singh I will definitely get the Surface Book at some point in the not too distant future but I didn’t want the first iteration hardware given that a product of its kind has never been released before. I’m convinced they’ll make it even better next time around.

The technology, also known as Intel Optane, promises to be more than 1000 times faster than NAND. Micron also announced it will market 3D XPoint as QuantX. Due to the price level Micron will only target its QuantX based products to data centers and enterprises. Micron’s Vice President, Storage Emerging Memory, Jon Carter stated during the currently held Flash Memory Summit that he believes Micron will make its first XPoint based revenues in the second half of 2017. By 2018 the technology should become more mainstream and by 2019 3D XPoint should see its breakthrough. Demand isn’t an issue, according to Carter, he stated that many companies are already demanding 3D XPoint based products. Intel who markets 3D XPoint products as Optane does believe it can bring the technology to consumer products. A recent roadmap shows the chip giant hopes to release the first Optane based SSDs together with its Kaby Lake CPU generation, at the end of 2016. Carter expects that Intel won’t be able to release the first Optane SSDs this year but in the first quarter of 2017. 3D XPoint is developed by Intel and Micron and the technology should combine the speed of RAM memory with the storage capacity of NAND memory. It should be 1000 times faster than NAND and today we learned it will be 4-5 times more expensive.   Related Forum: Latest News Headlines Related Tags: 3d xpoint micron intel Micron 9100 MAX 2.4TB NVMe Enterprise SSD Review – The New Performance Champion Intel demonstrates Optane SSD achieving 2GB/s data transfer at IDF Shenzen Micron M510DC 480GB Enterprise SSD Review Micron M510DC SSD review coolcolors MyCE Resident Posted on: 10 Aug 16 23:28 Quote: promises to be more than 1000 times faster than NAND.

By 2018, I'll still be using an old-fashioned hard drive. I'm sure there will be plenty of other individuals using HDDs by then, too. IHMO, the best way to get people to adopt SSDs is to make them bigger (in terms of capacity), and cheaper. Also, making the SSDs last longer is another way to make them more desirable. Making them faster should be a much lower priority than it is, IMHO. 0 Agree vroom Administrator and Reviewer Posted on: 14 Aug 16 09:33 Prices have come down, i got my first Corsair 64GB back in 2011 (If i'm not mistaken) and back then it cost me +100 euros, now with that amount of I can get a 480-512GB SSD, and much faster, better firmware support, better warranty and also TRIM that works, plus the new OS can handle much better the new SSDs. I am afraid that it will take a long time before we see +4TB SSDs priced very close to mechanical drives, so if its 2018 that prices drop more I will be very happy, even more if could have an SSD that is 1TB and cost little mote than 100 euros. 0 Agree Register Login Register to Myce.com Register in 10 seconds, pick a username, enter your mail address and proof you're human, that's all!

The deal is, we're told, worth $350m. Chipzilla's server-grade processors, the Xeon and Xeon Phi, power a lot of the world's deep learning training, and it's the algorithms from Nervana it wants. Nervana has "fully-optimized software and hardware stack for deep learning" that will be used to make Intel's processors run more efficiently on its Math Kernel Library – a compilation of mathematical processing routines that are used to make calculations in science and engineering more efficient. The upstart is planning to produce, at a cost of $28m, a 28nm TSMC-fabbed chip in the first quarter of 2017 that has a tensor-based architecture, has no floating-point math unit, and performs machine-learning tasks in hardware. You can read loads more background on the technology over on our sister site, The Next Platform. "With this deal, we can now shatter the old paradigm and move into a new regime of computing. We'll look back in 10 years and see this time as the inflection point of when compute architectures became neural," said Naveen Rao, CEO and co-founder of Nervana. Rao says Nervana intends to continue all existing development efforts, including: Nervana Neon, a Python-based software that describes deep learning models. Nervana Engine, a hardware integrated circuit coming in 2017. Nervana Cloud, a full-stack platform. AI is the latest trend for tech companies. This week, Apple also announced it had bought Turi, an AI start up in machine learning. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 1 Comment More from The Register Google gently leads Intel into its cloud: This is for your own good All is well, rejoice, rejoice, let's get into the white 'n' fluffy Intel mulls sale of Intel Security – reports Opinion The game done changed 6 Comments Intel is shipping an ARM-based FPGA.

By Hiawatha Bray Globe Staff  August 10, 2016 You haven’t usually heard “same old, same old” applied to Apple — until recently. Get used to it. If the rumors are right, Apple will unveil a new iPhone next month that will differ little from the one in my shirt pocket. An improved camera and the elimination of the old-school headphone jack are about all we can look forward to. Advertisement Still, iPhone loyalists will have at least a little incentive to line up outside the Apple store. Not so the millions who use Apple’s venerable line of Mac personal computers. Shop for one of these, and your choices are mostly the same as they were a year or more ago. Certainly the popular Retina MacBook Pro is showing its age, having gone without an update for well over a year. But it’s much worse for other models. Apple’s low-cost Mac Mini hasn’t been updated since 2014. Then there’s the Mac Pro, Apple’s top-of-the-line machine for movie editors and graphic artists. The Mac Pro was state-of-the-art when it was released over 2½ years ago, and it had a price tag to match: $4,000. Yet today, Apple’s still selling the same machine, at the same price.

Sign up for more newsletters here That would be commercial suicide in the Windows PC world. Raza Haider, executive director of commercial computing at Dell Inc., said his company upgrades pretty much every model every year. “We always want to make sure that our users are getting the latest and greatest performance,” Haider told me. Dell has no choice. If it rested on its laurels the way Apple has done, a horde of rival Windows PC makers would happily take up the slack. After all, Windows machines are utterly interchangeable. Don’t like the features on the latest Dell? Buy an HP or a Lenovo instead. Your software won’t care which brand of computer it runs on, so get the hottest one you can afford. It’s different with Apple. Advertisement Faced with fierce competition from Android smartphones, the company obliges its fans with annual iPhone updates. But Mac users are far less likely to defect. They love the unique operating system and dread the expense and trouble of converting to a Windows machine, even one with a newer, faster processor. And after all, the speed boost would hardly matter. Intel, which makes about 95 percent of the world’s PC processors, keeps producing better and better chips. But lately the improvements have been marginal. Moore’s Law, the principle that computers would double in processing power every couple of years, is finally petering out. “If you look at what Intel has today versus three or four years ago, it’s maybe 10 percent better, 20 percent better,” said chip analyst Linley Gwennap of the Linley Group in Mountain View, Calif. “Computers have become like cars. You don’t buy a new car every year or two,” Gwennap said. Indeed, “the cars are actually getting better faster than the PCs.” It’s bad news for Intel, whose chief executive, Brian Krzanich, warned in June that most users now go for five or six years before thinking about a new PC. That’s why Intel is laying off 12,000 employees, 11 percent of its global workforce. Clearly, Apple is onto something. Why invest millions in annual Mac updates, when few customers will benefit? For that matter, why offer price cuts on aging Macs, when customers keep buying? For quarter after quarter, Mac sales continued upward, bucking the yearslong slump in Windows PC sales. But not lately. Mac sales have now declined for three quarters in a row, probably because many potential buyers are sick of being offered leftovers. Michael Oh, founder of TSP, a Boston company that creates Mac-based computer systems for businesses, said that Apple needs to make some moves with the Mac, and fast. “If we get into the fall and Apple hasn’t done what amounts to a complete refresh,” Oh said, “I don’t know what the message is.” Actually, the message is coming through loud and clear. On Wednesday, Bloomberg Technology reported that Apple will soon roll out a new batch of MacBook Pro laptops. They’ll feature a slightly faster processor, a bit more storage, and other marginal improvements, like a keyboard that replaces the traditional row of function keys with a long, thin touchscreen. Still, all these enhancements add up to nothing much. Expect the same from the next iPhone, from new Android smartphones and Windows computers, and for all kinds of tablet computers. There’s been a great leveling off of innovation in digital hardware, and apart from a busted touchscreen or a crashed hard drive, it’s hard to see much point in buying the latest gadget. So you might as well stick with same old, same old. After all, that’s what you’ll get — even if you get something new. Hiawatha Bray can be reached at hiawatha.bray@globe.com.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Thu, Aug 11, 2016 - Page 10　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Intel makes deal to buy AI start-up AFP, SAN FRANCISCO US-based Intel Corp on Tuesday announced a deal to buy an “artificial intelligence” (AI) start-up as the company looks to broaden its role in data centers and the expanding Internet of Things. Intel did not disclose how much it is paying for Nervana Systems, but US media reports put the price at more than US$350 million. “With this acquisition, Intel is formally committing to pushing the forefront of AI technologies,” Nervana cofounder and chief executive Naveen Rao said in a blog post. “We can now shatter the old paradigm and move into a new regime of computing.” Founded two years ago in Southern California, Nervana has specialized in combining hardware and software to help machines process data in ways similar to human brains, the companies said. Intel plans to put Nervana expertise to work in Xeon and Xeon Phi chips to better handle “deep learning” in the Internet cloud, Intel data center group executive vice president Diane Bryant said in an online post. “While artificial intelligence is often equated with great science fiction, it isn’t relegated to novels and movies,” Bryant said. “AI is all around us,” he added. Separately, Apple Inc on Monday confirmed that it has bought US machine learning start-up Turi as Silicon Valley giants focus on a future rich with AI. Turi specializes in enabling developers to imbue software applications with programs so the apps respond to data more like the way people do.

Advisor Insights Newsletters Site Log In Advisor Insights Log In Intel Acquires Artificial Intelligence Startup Nervana Systems (INTC) By Shiv Mehta, CFA | August 9, 2016 — 9:48 PM EDT Leading chip-maker, Intel Corp. (INTC), announced on Tuesday its acquisition of Nervana Systems. According to a source speaking to Recode, Intel may have paid around $408 million for the artificial intelligence startup. Nervana Systems is based in San Diego and was founded by Naveen Rao, a former neural networks developer at Qualcomm. The company has developed a cloud platform, which allows consumers to build computer models that can learn. It is currently developing chips for deep learning, and this could be the main reason behind Intel's interest in the startup. The company has already raised $25 million in venture funding and currently has a contract with the U.S. Intelligence’s venture arm – In-Q-tel. Motive of the deal Following the deal, Intel Corp. will be able to offer cloud service along with software and hardware and make its products compatible with artificial intelligence networks. Diane Bryant, executive vice president of Intel’s data center business, said in a blog, “We believe that bringing together the Intel engineers who create the Intel Xeon and Intel Xeon Phi processors with the talented Nervana Systems’ team, we will be able to advance the industry faster than would have otherwise been possible.” She added, “We will continue to invest in leading-edge technologies that complement and enhance Intel’s AI portfolio.” Jason Waxman, Intel vice president, speaking to Recode, said that the shift to artificial intelligence could dwarf the move to cloud computing. (See also: Could Intel Exit the Data Security Business?) Another Deal in the Artificial Intelligence Space The deal announcement by Intel comes after Apple Inc (AAPL) announced it will be acquiring Seattle-based Turi Inc, which specializes in artificial intelligence. According to the VC research firm CB Insights, there have been 33 transactions in the artificial intelligence space since 2011, which includes buyers such as Yahoo, Alphabet, IBM Corp., Salesforce, and Twitter. On the other hand, PWC reports that there have been around 29 transactions in 2016 in this space, after accounting for smaller deals. This comes after 37 deals in 2015. Todson Page, PWC’s industry deals leaders, said, “We are on a very swift and increasing pace.” (See also: Inside Intel: A Look At The Mega Chipmaker.)

Powerful Android Adware Makes Its Way Into the Google Play Store GO Apps are still available for download at the time of writing Aug 10, 2016 11:17 GMT  ·  By Catalin Cimpanu  ·  Share:  Six apps from a developer named ValerySoftware have found their way into the official Google Play Store and have infected at least 3,000 users, based on their current download counts. The apps, discovered and reported this week by Intel McAfee security experts, are nothing more but hollow shells providing no functionality at all, except for the malicious features. Apps specialized in showing ads, downloading & installing other apps Advertised as all sorts of Minecraft mods, the apps are capable of collecting sensitive information from the phone, downloading Android apps from external sources or the Google Play Store. The malicious apps can also install the previously downloaded apps, uninstall them, and open or close applications on demand, based on commands received from a central command server. Additionally, the malicious app will use advertising SDKs to load and show ads from various vendors, silently tapping the ads behind the scenes. All apps ask users for administrator rights All of this is possible because the apps require administrator rights at installation time. Since the apps are installed from the Google Play Store, users are generally willing to grant them such powers, even if the underlying app is only a silly game mod and doesn't have a reason to require admin privileges. The reason for requiring admin-level access is to make it much harder to remove the apps after they were installed, something that most users providing feedback on the apps' Google Play pages have complained about. "I tried for mabye a month and still won't delete," wrote user Denise Travis. "I hate it and it won't work or delete," said Xavier Martinez. Apps have ties to a well-known cyber-criminal group from Europe Intel McAfee experts noticed that all apps were encrypted and obfuscated at many levels, which might explain why Google didn't detect their malicious behavior during the automated security tests it performs before approving the apps on the Play Store. For its part, Intel McAfee has noticed that the app uses domain names previously associated with other cyber-criminal activity, meaning the apps are part of a well-oiled cyber-crime syndicate. "Based in the domain owner’s information in this malware, we can tie the authors to a group of known cybercriminals in Europe who host and distribute malware," experts wrote. At the time of writing, all malicious ValerySoftware apps reported by Intel McAfee are still available for download. Intel McAfee detects these threats as Android/Agent.FL.

Naveen Rao, CEO and co-founder of Nervana, said with the acquisition, Intel is formally committing to pushing the forefront of AI technologies.   “Nervana intends to continue all existing development efforts, including the Nervana Neon deep learning framework, Nervana deep learning platform and the Nervana Engine deep learning hardware,” he said. Although Nervana’s technology and expertise will be incorporated into Intel’s portfolio to take AI to the “next level”, Rao said Nervana will continue to operate out of its San Diego Headquarters and will retain its talent, brand and “startup mentality”. AI emerges as top trend for security and big firms News of the acquisition comes just a week after Apple announced it latest AI acquisition with the purchase of machine-leaning company Turi in a deal reportedly worth $200m. The shift to AI is emerging as a firm trend among companies such as Google, Twitter, Facebook, Toyota and many others seeking to tailor-make and optimise services automatically, according to financial markets news site Seeking Alpha. AI is also increasingly becoming a focus of cyber security suppliers seeking to automate responses to lighten the load on security teams and enable organisations to respond to attacks at internet speed. Bryant said AI is central to the opportunity to derive value from the millions of terabytes of data generated by billions of smart, connected computing devices. “AI is all around us, from the commonplace such as talk-to-text, photo tagging and fraud detection to the cutting edge of precision medicine, injury prediction and autonomous cars,” she said. “Encompassing compute methods such as advanced data analytics, computer vision, natural language processing and machine learning, artificial intelligence is transforming the way businesses operate and how people engage with the world.” Read more about artificial intelligence Socially aware general-purpose artificial intelligence in the form of a dog could be the ideal form factor to take over the world. The UK government has announced plans to allow driverless cars to be used on public roads from early next year. A computer program has made history by passing the artificial intelligence test set by computer science pioneer Alan Turing. Smart systems like IBM’s Watson, autonomous vehicles and a growing army of robots are quietly making more and more decisions every day. According to Bryant, Intel processors power more than 97% of servers deployed to support machine learning workloads, with the Intel Xeon processor E5 family being the most widely deployed processor for deep learning inference. “While less than 10% of servers worldwide were deployed in support of machine learning last year, the capabilities and insights it enables makes machine learning the fastest growing form of AI,” she said. Bryant said Intel believes that by bringing together its engineers and the Nervan team, they will be able to advance the industry faster than would have otherwise been possible. She said further announcements around AI will be made at the Intel Developer Forum 2016 in San Francisco in August. CW+ Features Enjoy the benefits of CW+ membership, learn more and join.

Intel is tsarting to see AI as the next big thing and it is buying in expertise. Nervana which has not been the same since its lead singer killed himself appears to have got itself involved with cutting edge AI reseach [are you sure that is the name Nervana? Ed]. Intel wrote in its bog that the buy out will help develop Intel’s artificial intelligence portfolio and enhance the deep learning performance of Intel Xeon and Intel Xeon Phi processors. The company is led by former Qualcomm researcher Naveen Rao and has raised $25 million in venture funding and also has a contract to work with In-Q-tel, the U.S. intelligence community’s venture arm. It has not said how much it paid for the company but investors in Nervana include Global Playground, CME Ventures, Lux Capital, Allen & Co and AME Cloud Ventures so it looks like a large amount of money must have changed hands.

Eurogamer.net Follow @eurogamer Home Reviews PC Nvidia Titan X Pascal review Absolute power? By Richard Leadbetter Published 10/08/2016 With AMD's focus elsewhere in the graphics market, Nvidia's GeForce GTX 1080 has held an iron grip on the GPU top-end, offering a phenomenal level of performance, in exchange for a hefty price-premium. The new Titan X Pascal ups the ante still further: even more power, and an even higher price of entry. The bottom line is clear - the new Titan offers often staggering levels of performance, but we are looking at a 2x increase in price over GTX 1080 for a maximum boost of around 30-33 per cent in frame-rates. We can argue about the Titan line's value proposition, but it's a moot point - as a brand, it's Nvidia's equivalent to Intel's Extreme Edition processors and obviously, they wouldn't make them if they couldn't sell them. And of course, the Titan serves as a preview of sorts, a precursor for the more mainstream products to come. There was a time when the Maxwell-powered Titan X was similarly unattainable owing to its $999 ticket price. Then GTX 980 Ti came along, offering nigh-on identical frame-rates with a third of the price lopped off. And now, that same level of performance is available at just $380 in the form of GTX 1070, with a 100W power efficiency saving on top for good measure. In there here and now, Titan X Pascal sees Nvidia iterate on its previous strategy in terms of the make-up of its big chip. In many ways, the new Titan is essentially an upsized version of its existing GTX 1080, adding 50 per cent to everything in the core processor architecture. For example, memory bandwidth rises from 320GB/s to 480GB/s, with the interface expanding from 256 to 384 bits. Memory allocation itself rises from 8GB of GDDR5X to 12GB. ROPs are increased from 64 to 96. However, the CUDA core and texture unit count doesn't see quite as much of a linear jump - we go from 2560 to 3584 shaders in Titan X and from 160 to 224 texture units. It's now been confirmed that the fully enabled GP102 actually has 3840 shaders on the 12bn transistor die - 256 CUDA cores are disabled in order to get more workable chips from the production line. Nvidia Titan X Pascal specs Just a few months have passed since Nvidia unveiled GTX 1080 - its monstrous debut 16nm FinFET GPU king. Seeking to leverage its position, Titan X Pascal sees our first look at the consumer version of its big chip Pascal processor.. CUDA Cores: 3584 Base Clock: 1417MHz Boost Clock: 1531MHz Texture Units: 224 Texel Fill-Rate: 317.4 Gigatexels/sec Memory Clock: 10GHz Memory Bandwidth: 480GB/s ROPs: 96 L2 Cache Size: 3072KB TDP: 250W Transistors: 12 billion Die Size: 471mm2 Process: 16nm FinFet The price of admission for the Titan X Pascal is a colossal $1200 - twice the price of GTX 1080 and a 20 per cent hike over the Titan X Maxwell. We would expect to see an upcoming GTX 1080 Ti with similar performance occupying a much lower price-point when AMD returns to the fray. So at the shading level, there's about 25 per cent more computational power here, a combination of a 40 per cent increase in CUDA cores along with a pared back boost clock - Titan X Pascal's boost clock of 1531MHz is considerably behind GTX 1080's 1733MHz. Going into our tests, our concern was that we wouldn't get all of the expected increase to performance we would want from a Titan product, and that there may have been a compromise too many. Rich presents a video review of the Titan X Pascal, highlighting its generational leap over the last-gen behemoths, overclocking potential, plus its curious relationship with Nvidia's previous GPU king - the GTX 1080. One area where there are few surprises concerns the physical make-up of the card. The new Titan X Pascal takes the GTX 1080 Founders Edition's polygonal aesthetic and thermal solution and melds it with the distinctive black finish of the Maxwell Titan X. IO is also identical - three DisplayPorts, one HDMI 2.0 and a dual-link DVI output. The new offering has a 250W TDP, requiring one eight-pin and one six-pin power input, and of course, there are two SLI fingers for multi-card connectivity. Nvidia's GTX 1080 could get pretty toasty even before overclocking, so our second major concern centred on Titan X's thermals - how hot would this 12bn transistor behemoth get, and would this impact its overclocking potential? And in performance terms, rounding off the areas we really wanted to test, we wanted to see whether Nvidia had once again managed to deliver scalability across all resolutions. Some might say that running GTX 1080 or indeed this new GPU offering at 1080p resolutions may well be a monumental waste of GPU resources, but to that we say that there are many high refresh rate monitor owners that still can't run their games at a locked 120Hz. So full HD is where we'll begin our performance testing. Our benchmark suite at 1080p is designed to put speed first. Yes, we are indeed running at ultra settings in almost all cases, but super-sampling and multi-sampling anti-aliasing are disabled in favour of the best post-process solutions available - for the most part, this is SMAA. The results are intriguing, suggesting that perhaps finally, Nvidia has produced hardware that can outstrip the capabilities of its highly impressive software layer. 1080p is Titan X Pascal's weakest area. Frame-rate uplifts vs GTX 1080 are weaker than expected, though the card performs well against Titan X Maxwell and especially R9 Fury X. 1920x1080 (1080p) Titan X Pascal GTX 1080 GTX 1070 Titan X Maxwell R9 Fury X Assassin's Creed Unity, Ultra High, FXAA 119.2 98.1 79.1 75.0 61.9 Ashes of the Singularity, Extreme, 0x MSAA, DX12 87.6 75.0 57.0 59.8 70.0 Crysis 3, Very High, SMAA T2x 153.9 128.3 107.0 105.9 99.9 The Division, Ultra, SMAA 117.9 92.8 78.3 73.9 67.7 Far Cry Primal, Ultra, SMAA 132.2 105.6 88.8 81.8 75.3 Hitman, Ultra, SMAA, DX12 136.8 115.8 92.5 84.4 93.7 Rise of the Tomb Raider, Very High, High Textures, SMAA, DX12 167.2 133.5 105.0 100.1 81.2 The Witcher 3, Ultra, Post AA, No HairWorks 137.6 114.0 94.2 86.6 78.2 The lowest increases vs GTX 1080 actually come from two DX12 titles - Ashes of the Singularity and Hitman post just a 16.8 per cent and 18.1 per cent increase. Crysis 3 manages just a 20 per cent uptick, but the big surprise is Assassin's Creed Unity at 21.5 per cent. Typically this game will take any GPU and absorb its shading and bandwidth potential - it's the reason it's still in our benchmark line-up, as borne out by the GTX 1080 vs Titan X Maxwell differential of 30.8 per cent. The Division scales best at 28.2 per cent vs GTX 1080, followed by Rise of the Tomb Raider at 25.2 per cent. The delta vs AMD's R9 Fury X ranges from 25 per cent with Ashes of the Singularity to a gargantuan 105.9 per cent in Tomb Raider. Perhaps this offers a preview of the challenges to come - AMD's weaker driver is holding back some excellent hardware at this relatively low resolution. Compared to the original Maxwell-powered Titan X, its successor is holding up well with anything from a 45.3 per cent uplift in Ashes of the Singularity through a hugely impressive 67 per cent boost in Tomb Raider. Across the selection of titles, we have an aggregate 55 per cent improvement. So where are the bottlenecks then? Well, take a look at Far Cry Primal and Crysis 3 and you'll see 'throttle points' - only evident if you can study performance in context. Crysis 3 might be 20 per cent slower as an average, but this is not a consistent delta. You'll see Titan X Pascal shoot away of GTX 1080, then occasionally come crashing down in detail-intensive scenes. Clearly the hardware is not at fault - it's simply that the GPU is stalling owing to the lack of instructions from the CPU. And that's quite a state of affairs, bearing in mind we're running the Titan X Pascal with the Core i7 6700K overclocked to 4.6GHz. Nvidia's new GPU king will deliver a boost at full HD resolution, but bottlenecking isn't conducive to a smooth, consistent gameplay experience. For this reason, we need to push harder on resolution to show this GPU at its best. Titan X practically demands running at a higher resolution. For our money, 2560x1440 or its ultrawide 3840x1440 equivalent, are the best entry points for utilising this card. 2560x1440 (1440p) Titan X Pascal GTX 1080 GTX 1070 Titan X Maxwell R9 Fury X Assassin's Creed Unity, Ultra High, FXAA 79.4 64.0 51.0 48.8 40.8 Ashes of the Singularity, Extreme, 0x MSAA, DX12 83.7 64.3 56.8 51.6 62.0 Crysis 3, Very High, SMAA T2x 102.8 83.0 65.8 65.4 65.6 The Division, Ultra, SMAA 84.8 67.1 55.4 54.2 52.8 Far Cry Primal, Ultra, SMAA 96.3 75.8 61.9 57.1 58.1 Hitman, Ultra, SMAA, DX12 102.4 86.1 67.4 61.5 73.6 Rise of the Tomb Raider, Very High, High Textures, SMAA, DX12 109.4 87.7 68.5 67.4 59.1 The Witcher 3, Ultra, Post AA, No HairWorks 108.3 83.7 67.0 62.1 60.1 Moving onto 2560x1440, or qHD resolution, the new Titan X shows far more consistency in its performance uplift compared to its predecessor. Only two titles - Crysis 3 and The Division - show increases less than 60 per cent (57.2 and 56.5 respectively). Elsewhere, we're well up, with The Witcher in particular showing a huge 74.4 per cent boost. The gap only widens with comparisons to Fury X, where The Witcher 3 and Rise of the Tomb Raider are 80.2 and 85.1 per cent faster and AC Unity sees a colossal 94.6 per cent boost. Titan X Pascal is much faster than AMD mainstays Ashes of the Singularity and Hitman, though the gap closes to 35 per cent and 39.1 per cent respectively. However, while the comparison with prior gen hardware are exceptional, the GTX 1080 is still putting up spirited resistance to Titan X Pascal's sheer brute force, with only Ashes of the Singularity and The Witcher 3 coming close to (or breaking) the 30 per cent increase in frame-rates we would expect from a big chip Nvidia product. The aggregate boost in performance from across all eight titles rises from 1080p's 22 per cent to 25.6 per cent. This is mostly in line with the specs boost we see on paper and highlights that while the last-gen Titan X was a beast, Nvidia really did an excellent job with the GTX 1080 in pushing what was possible from its debut 16nmFF Pascal processor. Bearing in mind the scalability in memory bandwidth offered by Titan X Pascal, we should see the performance differential push on with a much higher resolution. 4K offers a 2.25x boost to resolution over 1440p, so it should be the best test of Titan X's credentials on attainable, consumer-level display technology. Titan X Pascal shows the biggest boosts over all other 'uber cards' at 4K resolution. GTX 1080 works really well at this resolution - the new Titan can blow it out of the water on many titles. 3840x2160 (4K) Titan X Pascal GTX 1080 GTX 1070 Titan X Maxwell R9 Fury X Assassin's Creed Unity, Ultra High, FXAA 43.1 32.9 25.4 25.6 24.3 Ashes of the Singularity, Extreme, 0x MSAA, DX12 63.7 53.6 43.1 40.9 46.2 Crysis 3, Very High, SMAA T2x 50.0 39.6 31.5 31.3 31.5 The Division, Ultra, SMAA 49.6 38.5 31.0 30.7 31.1 Far Cry Primal, Ultra, SMAA 49.6 38.5 31.0 30.7 31.1 Hitman, Ultra, SMAA, DX12 54.7 42.4 33.5 33.5 34.3 Rise of the Tomb Raider, Very High, High Textures, SMAA, DX12 62.1 49.0 38.5 36.2 41.2 The Witcher 3, Ultra, Post AA, No HairWorks 63.2 47.5 37.3 34.0 36.4 Titan X Pascal continues its domination over the last-gen powerhouses at UHD, with a fantastic 65.6 per cent cumulative average in performance boost over its Maxwell predecessor, and a 61.2 per cent boost over the R9 Fury X. It's interesting to note that at 4K, the Fury X finally shows signs of truly succumbing in the challenging Hitman DX12 bench - it held its own fairly well at lower resolutions, but at 4K, the Titan X Pascal is 50.7 per cent faster. Also of interest is The Witcher 3, which really does like Nvidia's new offering - it's a mammoth 85.9 per cent faster than the last-gen Titan. The GTX 1080 continues to hold its own though: Titan X Pascal is faster, but across all eight titles, the uplift averages at 27.6 per cent. It's dragged down to a certain extent by a mystifyingly low resut in Ashes of the Singularity (in marked contrast to its 1440p showing). Generally speaking, it seems to be the case that Titan X Pascal offers a 27-30 per cent increase in 4K performance over GTX 1080, depending on the title. And we should expect some bigger boosts in select titles too - The Witcher 3 comes in 33 per cent faster. A couple of weeks ago, we put together a 4K 'let's play' video showing our attempts to run an overclocked GTX 1080 at UHD resolution, the aim being to lock at 60fps on challenging, modern games. By and large, with sensible compromises, we could hit 50-60fps in most titles, producing a superb experience overall. We're in the process of repeating this test with Titan X Pascal and the benchmark leap translates into palpable increases in the quality of the actual gameplay experience. The Witcher 3 proved troublesome to lock at 60fps on high settings with the overclocked GTX 1080. With Titan X Pascal, we're at ultra with only momentary drops below the desired frame-rate target. Put simply, it's beautiful. Curious to see how Titan X Pascal performance scales running the same gaming workloads across 1080p, 1440p and 4K? We were too, which is why we put together this analysis. One of our primary concerns with Titan X Pascal was the reduced boost clock compared to GTX 1080 - a straight 200MHz drop, based on Nvidia's spec. A 1.53GHz boost is still creditable, but the happy news is that in-game performance is typically higher. Where GTX 1080 tops out at 1866MHz, we noted Titan X at around 100-120MHz lower. And begs the question, to what extent can the big chip Pascal be overclocked? Typically we've found ourselves hitting a brick wall on the smaller processors at around 2050MHz. Well, GP102 can still be pushed well beyond its boost clock spec, and seems to hit similar limits at around 1950MHz. We achieved a rock-solid overclock by adding 140MHz to the core frequency, while the G5X memory scaled like a champ. Artefacting started to creep in at a mammoth +750MHz, so we dialled that down to +700MHz and didn't have to worry about it again. However, what's clear is that to get the most out of the overclock, you'll need to manually ramp up the fan - it seems that frequency throttling seems to kick in around 82-83 degrees Celsius. For our tests, I upped the fan to 65 per cent (beyond that it gets obtrusively loud), settled it on our Crysis 3 test scene (see below) for 30 minutes to ensure stability and topped out thermals, then ran the test suite. Generally speaking, you're looking at 11 to 16 per cent of additional performance here, but some titles are less impressed with the additional power, with Hitman DX12 posting a paltry 8.3 per cent increase in frame-rate. The peak 1950MHz clock drops back pretty quickly by 100-150MHz presumably owing to the temperature limit - so it is a shame that only Nvidia's cooler is available (a GP102-based GTX 1080 Ti with third party coolers should be very interesting). However, Nvidia's power efficiency continues to impress. Pushed to its limits, we noted a peak system power draw of just 434W from the wall while stock power consumption was effectively on par with the Radeon R9 Fury X. Even overclocked it's on par with a stock Radeon R9 390. This scene from Crysis 3 is easily repeatable and incurs a heavy, sustained load on the GPU - good for testing overclocks and heavy power draw. Titan X Pascal Titan X Pascal OC GTX 1080 GTX 1070 Titan X R9 Fury X R9 390 Peak System Power Draw 384W 434W 303W 263W 361W 385W 437W Nvidia Titan X Pascal - the Digital Foundry verdict Fast just got a whole lot faster. In terms of the generational leap, Nvidia has succeeded in providing a 60 per cent improvement in performance compared to its last-gen Titan, living up to the firm's claims. However, the differential with GTX 1080 isn't quite so clear-cut - Nvidia pushed the boat out with its GP104 flagship and it's punching a touch above its weight here. Mostly, it comes down to just a few percentage points though, and in the majority of use-case scenarios, Titan X Pascal delivers the palpably faster experience you would want, assuming you're not gaming at 1080p. Meet the creator of Jenga Do you really know the rules? 4K is where this product excels, and from a personal standpoint, I've been trying to find a good, desktop experience where those extra pixels really count. UHD displays in 23/27/28-inch range just don't cut the mustard - the pixel density is simply insane, and even trying out the 32-inch Asus PQ321Q produces a similar experience. However, a 40-inch Samsung KU6400 positioned as a desktop screen paired with the Titan X Pascal is handing in some epic results where 4K really shines. This is something we'll be returning to in more depth soon, but running the Witcher 3 on this set-up on ultra settings at 60Hz (HairWorks off though, naturally) offers the kind of generational leap over console that can't be ignored - 2x the frame-rate, 4x the resolution and massively improved quality settings. It's remarkable. Titan X Pascal is obviously expensive, and clearly aimed at the niche that can afford to double their cash outlay for 30 per cent more performance - but Nvidia carved out the market here and makes no secret that where there's a Titan, a Ti follows thereafter, sometimes just by a matter of months. So in this sense, this review almost acts as a preview of sorts for the inevitable GTX 1080 Ti that lurks around the corner. Based on GTX 980 Ti's emergence, we should expect it to launch in line with, or just prior, to AMD's new Vega 'uber card'. But right now, there is no Vega, and Nvidia has absolute domination of the GPU top-tier. If you want absolute power, be prepared to pay a hefty price for it.

Intel said that because of the pervasive reach of cloud computing, and the decreasing cost of computing thanks to Moore’s Law and billions of connected devices generating millions of terabytes of data every single day, AI will be critical to managing this data. Diane Bryant, executive vice president and general manager of Intel’s Data Centre Group said that AI is no longer science fiction in movies and novels. “AI is all around us, from the commonplace (talk-to-text, photo tagging, fraud detection) to the cutting edge (precision medicine, injury prediction, autonomous cars). Key methods of expansion “Encompassing compute methods like advanced data analytics, computer vision, natural language processing and machine learning, artificial intelligence is transforming the way businesses operate and how people engage with the world. “Machine learning, and its subset deep learning, are key methods for the expanding field of AI.” Bryant said that Intel processors power more than 97pc of servers deployed to support machine learning workloads today. “The Intel Xeon processor E5 family is the most widely-deployed processor for deep-learning inference and the recently launched Intel Xeon Phi processor delivers the scalable performance needed for deep-learning training. “While less than 10pc of servers worldwide were deployed in support of machine learning last year, the capabilities and insights it enables makes machine learning the fastest-growing form of AI.” Intel discovers the Shangri-La of AI? She said that Intel has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Nervana Systems. According to various reports, Intel is paying up to $408m for the 48-person company, which started up in 2014. “Nervana has a fully-optimised software and hardware stack for deep learning,” Bryant said. “Their IP and expertise in accelerating deep-learning algorithms will expand Intel’s capabilities in the field of AI. “We will apply Nervana’s software expertise to further optimise the Intel Math Kernel Library and its integration into industry-standard frameworks. Nervana’s engine and silicon expertise will advance Intel’s AI portfolio and enhance the deep-learning performance and TCO of our Intel Xeon and Intel Xeon Phi processors,” Bryant added.

Intel Corp said it would acquire startup Nervana Systems as the world's largest chipmaker bolsters its artificial intelligence capabilities. San Diego, California-based Nervana will help develop Intel's artificial intelligence portfolio and enhance the deep learning performance of Intel Xeon and Intel Xeon Phi processors, the company said in a blog post. Though chip giant didn't disclose the value of the acquisition, according to technology website Recode the deal is valued at around $408 million. Nervana Systems is led by former Qualcomm researcher Naveen Rao and has reportedly raised $25 million in venture funding. The company also reportedly has a contract to work with In-Q-tel, the US intelligence community's venture arm. Talking about the deal, Rao told Recode that by selling to Intel the company has "access to technology we'd never dream about." The cmpany has developed an optimized software library called Neon for Deep Neural Networks. Investors in Nervana include Global Playground, CME Ventures, Lux Capital, Allen & Co and AME Cloud Ventures. Allen & Co LLC is the exclusive financial adviser to Nervana in the deal. Last week, Apple too announced the acquisition of US machine learning startup Turi as Silicon Valley giants focus on artificial intelligence. Turi specializes in enabling developers to imbue software applications with artificial intelligence, so the apps learn to think more the way people do. Apple has been stepping up its artificial intelligence efforts to compete against rival services from Amazon, Google and Microsoft.

In the photograph, a man walks past a logo of Intel during the annual Computex computer exhibition in Taipei, June 1, 2016. Photo: REUTERS/Tyrone Siu Intel Corporation is expanding its focus on artificial intelligence. The Santa Clara, California, company announced Tuesday it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire Nervana Systems, a deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI) company. In a statement, Diane Bryant, general manager of Intel’s Data Center Group, said Nervana’s “IP [intellectual property] and expertise in accelerating deep learning algorithms will expand Intel’s capabilities in the field of AI. We will apply Nervana’s software expertise to further optimize the Intel Math Kernel Library and its integration into industry standard frameworks. Nervana’s Engine and silicon expertise will advance Intel’s AI portfolio and enhance the deep learning performance and TCO of our Intel Xeon and Intel Xeon Phi processors.” Nervana is a startup headquartered in San Diego and began operations in 2014. In the words of co-founder and CEO Naveen Rao, the company “started with the idea that we can engineer better solutions for computation by bringing together computer engineering, neuroscience, and machine learning.” Related Stories Samsung Buys US Cloud Computing Firm Joyent Apple Doubles Down On Privacy Speaking about the rationale behind the acquisition by Intel, Rao said in a statement: “The semiconductor integrated circuit is one of humanity’s crowning achievements and Intel has the best semiconductor technology in the world.  Nervana’s AI expertise combined with Intel’s capabilities and huge market reach will allow us to realize our vision and create something truly special.” With the growth in mobile phone usage, personal computer sales have slowed, and the world’s largest chip maker, facing an existential crisis, has long been diversifying its product portfolio. Having started work on car security systems in 2011, it recently partnered with BMW and Mobileye for a self-driving car collaboration. The company also makes wearables such as smart earbuds and smartwatches — it issued a worldwide recall for the Basis smartwatches last week after the devices were found overheating and causing burns. The companies did not disclose the value of the deal, which will need customary regulatory approvals. However, an unnamed source told Recode the deal was valued at about $400 million. Nervana said it “will continue to operate out of our San Diego Headquarters and will retain our talent, brand, and startup mentality.” Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

According to sources who have spoken to Recode, the deal is valued at around $408 million. Nervana Systems was founded in 2014 and is headquartered in San Diego, California. It is led by former Qualcomm researcher Naveen Rao and it has raised around $25 mn in venture funding. Nervana had open-sourced its Neon deep learning software last year. The company will join Intel’s Data Centre Group after the deal is closed. Intel vice president Jason Waxman claims that the shift to artificial intelligence will be far greater than the move to cloud computing. According to him, machine learning is of significance as we are moving from a world where people control a couple of devices connected to the internet, to one where billions of devices are connected online and are talking to each other. Unlike others who have been making intelligent software to run on top of a cluster of graphics chips, Nervana Systems has been working to bring machine learning at the chip level. It has a fully optimised software and hardware stack for deep-learning. Rao is excited to be part of Intel as it gives him access to cutting edge technology. Intel chips are used in most data centres and it is a clear leader in that space. In the artificial intelligence space Intel competes with the likes of Nvidia which provides high performance computing solutions when it comes to creating chips for deep learning which involves training artificial neural networks on lots of data and then getting them to make inferences on this data. Google has its tensor processing units (TPUs) which it uses for its deep learning projects. “We will apply Nervana’s software expertise to further optimize the Intel Math Kernel Library and its integration into industry standard frameworks. Nervana’s Engine and silicon expertise will advance Intel’s AI portfolio and enhance the deep learning performance and TCO of our Intel Xeon and Intel Xeon Phi processors,” said Diane Bryant, EVP and GM of the Data Centre Group at Intel on her blog.

WTF? Biz once valued at billions bought for $275m in three-letter mergasm Jurassic Park ... Wait, that's a UNIX, er, IRIX system – I know this 11 Aug 2016 at 23:49, Iain Thomson Iain Thomson Get email alert when this author posts Common Topics Nsa, Nasa, Apple, Microsoft, Google Recent Articles Living with the Pixel XL – Google's attempt at a high-end phone El Paso city bungs $3.2m to email crooks pretending to be bosses Look out, SpaceX et al – China's Long March-5 rocket blasts off Hewlett Packard Enterprise has bought venerable computing firm SGI – formerly Silicon Graphics – for $275m. Over the past few years, SGI has concentrated on the big-iron end of the server market and high-performance computing. It's this technology that HPE wants to bolster its hardware lineup. "At HPE, we are focused on empowering data-driven organizations," said Antonio Neri, general manager of HPE's enterprise group, on Thursday. "SGI's innovative technologies and services, including its best-in-class big data analytics and high-performance computing solutions, complement HPE's proven data center solutions designed to create business insight and accelerate time to value for customers." SGI, which made millions in the 1990s with its pioneering workstations, has been in decline for well over a decade. Its MIPS-based workstations were the darlings of the entertainment industry in particular, starring in a generation of films such as Jurassic Park – which featured SGI systems behind and in front of the camera – as well as Terminator 2, Men in Black, Forrest Gump, and so on. SGI sold gear into other industries, too, and to the military; it came up with the 3D graphics API OpenGL, which is still used just about everywhere today; it ported UNIX System V to MIPS, calling the resulting operating system IRIX; and it was responsible for the GPU in the Nintendo 64. After getting caught out by the rise of low-cost x86 clusters, SGI languished, and its own Intel workstations built in response were shunned by the industry. It got caught out moving to Chipzilla's ill-fated Itanium processors before shifting to Xeon parts, and went through two bankruptcy motions before being bought by Rackable Systems in 2009 for $42.5m. "Our HPC and high-performance data technologies and analytic capabilities, based on a 30+ year legacy of innovation, complement HPE's industry-leading enterprise solutions. This combination addresses today's complex business problems that require applying data analytics and tools to securely process vast amounts of data," said Jorge Titinger, CEO and president of SGI. "The computing power that our solutions deliver can interpret this data to give customers quicker and more actionable insights. Together, HPE and SGI will offer one of the most comprehensive suites of solutions in the industry, which can be brought to market more effectively through HPE's global reach." Or at least, that's what both sides are hoping. HPE paid $7.75 per SGI share to acquire the company, a 30 per cent premium on its stock price at the close of the market. SGI's total revenue for the 12 months to June 24 this year was $533m, up from $521m a year ago. It made a net loss of $11.1m, which is better than the $39m it lost the year before. Its operating costs nudged up to $168.7m from $145.6m due to overheads from rising sales, marketing and general admin. "SGI, the victim of a cash cow business selling to military and the biggest companies in the world, never made a transition to PC graphics. It could have been Nvidia. Instead, it’s now a footnote," El Reg columnist and VRML co-inventor Mark Pesce blogged earlier today. "This is a sad day, because without SGI, much of modern VR simply wouldn’t exist. They paid for a lot of pioneering research work — yes, in order to sell more systems, but nonetheless they paid for the infrastructure that people still use today – such as OpenGL – to create virtual worlds." ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 37 Comments More from The Register HPE CEO Meg Whitman endorses Hillary Clinton, dumps on Trump Avowed Republican says reality TV star 'would endanger our prosperity and national security' 25 Comments HPE dumps software biz into the bargain bin For sale: Slightly used Autonomy, price negotiable 10 Comments Now be honest – would you take divorce advice from Meg Whitman?

Later processors, like Intel's Kaby Lake and AMD's Bristol Ridge, will not be supported on 7 and 8.1 at all. To use those processors, their associated devices will need to be running Windows 10 (or, you know, Linux or something). This has just changed for Skylake, but not for Kaby Lake and Bristol Ridge. Skylake will now be supported through the entire life-cycle of Windows 7 (January 14, 2020) and Windows 8.1 (January 10, 2023). This is particularly good because Skylake was already released and in the hands of users when they first announced pulling the plug. Now users will know before they purchase their hardware (albeit not before many have purchased a retail copy of Windows 7 or Windows 8.x with transfer rights that intend to continually upgrade beyond Skylake or to AMD's Zen architecture) that Microsoft will not support it outside of Windows 10.

Let's hope the next Apple laptops that come after Apple's upcoming Intel and Polaris macbook pro update will be some macbooks with some Zen/Polaris APU SKUs, so I can get a laptop that runs the BSD Kernel, and will probably do fine for the Linux Kernel also as the drivers are not hard to port over. I'm tired of waiting for any Linux OS laptop OEMs to shed their Intel/Nvidia dependencies! If Apple would just dump Intel for its 2017/2018 line of macbooks and go all Zen/Polaris they would get my money! Then users could get AMD’s better graphics along with Zen’s x86 ISA running cores for better graphics on all macbook laptop SKUs! It’s not like Apple is using any top end Intel SKUs in their macbooks anyways. If Apple really wants to be relevant again in new laptop innovations they would be funding a custom Zen/Polaris APU with HBM on an interposer module and saving a lot of space for a bigger battery in its macbook line of laptops. Apple has billions to spaff away on other less important things and Apple should be really focusing on some Zen/Polaris laptops that will get the people’s business who will never switch to windows 10. Apple could be getting plenty of business from customers who would dual boot MacOS(formally OSX) with a Linux distro and run Linux/Vulkan games and graphics software. reply August 11, 2016 | 06:51 PM - Posted by Butthurt Beluga So, in laymans terms, what does this mean for the casual user? If I slap an AM4 Zen CPU into a Windows 7/8.1 machine, will it just not boot into Windows or something? Or it won't perform as well if it was supported? And the fact that Windows can do this and no governments or consumers bat an eye is just... baffling, really. reply August 11, 2016 | 08:06 PM - Posted by Scott Michaud Microsoft hasn't been too clear about that. Even if it does work, it allows them to release a security update that bricks it (we'll assume accidentally because they refuse to test 7 and 8.1 on Zen). Could just work forever, though, albeit under an ever-looming dagger. reply August 11, 2016 | 09:11 PM - Posted by Anonymous (not verified) If the CPU/APU/SOC hardware comes out before a windows OS's EOL windows 7/8.1 should at least have enough support to run under the new hardware as it's x86 based, maybe not all the new processor’s hardware features will be supported, but really M$ is just shooting itself in the foot with this nonsense. This is really where Linux can get some market share on the newer hardware if M$ does not back off even more. M$'s risks driving more 7/8.1 users over to Linux and Apple/MacOS with all this windows 10 only hardware nonsense! The “free” windows 10 upgrade install base relative to 7’s sill top install base after even a year of nefarious tactics from M$ to ram windows 10 down peoples’ throats should be an indicator of just how many potential customers M$ will loose to Apple’s MacOS, and the Linux based PC market come 2020 and 2023. There are a lot of windows 7 “Downgrade” installs from 8/8.1 Pro versions that will be able to go back to 8.1 after 2020 with the TIFKAM crap disabled! But now all that is up in the air and users will switch to Apple’s Hardware/MacOS and Linux and M$ will lose all the 7/8.1 install base very quickly if it continues to push its foolish windows 10 tactics. This is definitely an indicator that all along people never really liked M$, and they liked 7 mostly because it stayed out of the users’ personal business and gave users more control over their own hardware. People like 7 and hate M$ more than M$ realizes, and many will go to Apple’s closed ecosystem before they go to M$’s even more closed ecosystem, as that EULA from windows 10 is much too far reaching in its ability to allow for M$’s intrusion into the end users personal privacy and loss of control over their own hardware. All that tasteless ad pushing under windows 10 will also help to push more users away from windows 10, and M$ for good. reply August 11, 2016 | 11:00 PM - Posted by Anonymous (not verified) The more you tighten your grip, M$, the more PC systems will slip through your fingers! reply August 12, 2016 | 05:01 AM - Posted by Hakuren Does that mean that they backtrack on Skylake-E/X too?

HPE is not to be confused with HP Inc. HPQ, the computer and printing division of the original parent company, Hewlett-Packard.   Based in Fremont, CA, Silicon provides high-performance computing (HPC) services such as servers, storage, and data center solutions to clients in the cloud computing, oil & gas, e-commerce, social networking, and other industries. “At HPE, we are focused on empowering data-driven organizations,” said Antonio Neri, executive vice president and general manager of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. “SGI's innovative technologies and services, including its best-in-class big data analytics and high performance computing solutions, complement HPE's proven data center solutions designed to create business insight and accelerate time to value for customers.” The rise of cloud computing and data processing software has been notable. This deal continues a merger trend in the industry, with Intel Co. INTC recently announcing plans to purchase deep-learning startup Nervana Systems for $400 million. Although Intel currently dominates the HPC market, Hewlett Packard hopes to use its synergies with SGI to “strengthen the leading position and financial performance of the combined businesses,” as per the official announcement. Hewlett Packard expects the acquisition to have no effect on earnings in the first full year following its closing, and then an accretive effect from there onward. The company expects the deal to close in the first quarter of 2017. Hewlett Packard has seen just one earnings estimate revision in the last 60 days, a downward revision for next fiscal year from $2.03 to $2.02 in earnings per share. It has seen a year-to-date price change of 42.8%, and is in an industry that ranks in the top 39% of the Zacks Industry Rank. Hewlett Packard Enterprises currently sits at a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) due to the aforementioned earnings estimate revision. The Zacks Rank is a truly marvelous trading tool. Our ranking system has beaten the S&P 500, yielding an average return of 25% per year for the last 29 years! Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Over the past few years, SGI has concentrated on the big-iron end of the server market and high-performance computing. It's this technology that HPE wants to bolster its hardware lineup. "At HPE, we are focused on empowering data-driven organizations," said Antonio Neri, general manager of HPE's enterprise group, on Thursday. "SGI's innovative technologies and services, including its best-in-class big data analytics and high-performance computing solutions, complement HPE's proven data center solutions designed to create business insight and accelerate time to value for customers." SGI, which made millions in the 1990s with its pioneering workstations, has been in decline for well over a decade. Its MIPS-based workstations were the darlings of the entertainment industry in particular, starring in a generation of films such as Jurassic Park – which featured SGI systems behind and in front of the camera – as well as Terminator 2, Men in Black, Forrest Gump, and so on. SGI sold gear into other industries, too, and to the military; it came up with the 3D graphics API OpenGL, which is still used just about everywhere today; it ported UNIX System V to MIPS, calling the resulting operating system IRIX; and it was responsible for the GPU in the Nintendo 64. After getting caught out by the rise of low-cost x86 clusters, SGI languished, and its own Intel workstations built in response were shunned by the industry. It got caught out moving to Chipzilla's ill-fated Itanium processors before shifting to Xeon parts, and went through two bankruptcy motions before being bought by Rackable Systems in 2009 for $42.5m. "Our HPC and high-performance data technologies and analytic capabilities, based on a 30+ year legacy of innovation, complement HPE's industry-leading enterprise solutions. This combination addresses today's complex business problems that require applying data analytics and tools to securely process vast amounts of data," said Jorge Titinger, CEO and president of SGI. "The computing power that our solutions deliver can interpret this data to give customers quicker and more actionable insights. Together, HPE and SGI will offer one of the most comprehensive suites of solutions in the industry, which can be brought to market more effectively through HPE's global reach." Or at least, that's what both sides are hoping. HPE paid $7.75 per SGI share to acquire the company, a 30 per cent premium on its stock price at the close of the market. SGI's total revenue for the 12 months to June 24 this year was $533m, up from $521m a year ago. It made a net loss of $11.1m, which is better than the $39m it lost the year before. Its operating costs nudged up to $168.7m from $145.6m due to overheads from rising sales, marketing and general admin. "SGI, the victim of a cash cow business selling to military and the biggest companies in the world, never made a transition to PC graphics. It could have been Nvidia. Instead, it’s now a footnote," El Reg columnist and VRML co-inventor Mark Pesce blogged earlier today. "This is a sad day, because without SGI, much of modern VR simply wouldn’t exist. They paid for a lot of pioneering research work — yes, in order to sell more systems, but nonetheless they paid for the infrastructure that people still use today – such as OpenGL – to create virtual worlds." ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 37 Comments More from The Register HPE CEO Meg Whitman endorses Hillary Clinton, dumps on Trump Avowed Republican says reality TV star 'would endanger our prosperity and national security' 25 Comments Dude, you got a Dell lawyer: HPE sues high-flying ex-exec after defection to EMC Can anyone leave this company without a lawsuit being filed? 20 Comments HPE dumps software biz into the bargain bin For sale: Slightly used Autonomy, price negotiable 10 Comments Now be honest – would you take divorce advice from Meg Whitman?

The company's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is currently 'BB+', and the Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of current ratings follows at the end of this release. Western Digital amended the April 29, 2016 Existing Loan Agreement to establish New Senior Secured Term B-1 Loans, the proceeds from which will be used to refinance outstanding principal amounts under the Senior Secured U.S. Term B Loans, reducing annual interest expense. Western Digital expects amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured U.S. Term B Loans will be $3 billion, pro forma for a $750 million voluntary prepayment expected to be consummated contemporaneous with the Amendment's Effective Date. Terms of the Amended Loan Agreement are substantially the same as those of the Existing Loan Agreement. All obligations of Western Digital under the Amended Loan Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis by each of the company's wholly-owned domestic Restricted Subsidiaries. Borrowings under the Amended Loan Agreement are secured by a perfected first-priority security interest in substantially all the Borrowers' and Guarantors' tangible and intangible assets, including 65% of the voting stock of first tier foreign subsidiaries. KEY RATING DRIVERS --Diversified Storage Portfolio: Fitch believes the SanDisk acquisition, closed May 12, 2016, diversifies Western Digital's technology portfolio. The combination positions Western Digital for next generation storage platforms optimizing hard disk drives (HDDs), NAND flash-based solid state drives (SSD) and software, while mitigating nearer-term SSD cannibalization of HDDs. --Increased Scale: The SanDisk acquisition increases Western Digital's scale and supports higher investment intensity, driven by rapid industry evolution around cloud driven data growth and new storage architectures, including 3D NAND, and larger competitors. Should operating cash flows at Western Digital's joint venture (JV) with Toshiba Corporation (Toshiba) or equipment leases be insufficient to keep pace with 3D NAND development intensify, Western Digital and Toshiba Corporation may jointly decide to contribute capital to the JV. --Margin Expansion Roadmap: Fitch expects cost synergies from the SanDisk acquisition and integration of Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (Hitachi) will drive profit margin expansion. Fitch believes Western Digital is on track to achieve cost synergies, including $474 million of run-rate cost synergies exiting calendar 2016 and $800 million exiting calendar 2017 related to Hitachi. Given Western Digital's high fixed cost model, lower fixed costs should drive operating EBITDA margin expansion to the mid-20s from the low 20s on a pre-synergy basis. --Commitment to Debt Reduction: Fitch expects rapid debt reduction from free cash flow (FCF) and tax efficient use of offshore cash, made possible in connection with a restructuring that is expected to relocate SanDisk's domestic intellectual property (IP) offshore, will result in the Company achieving its 1.5x total leverage (total debt to operating EBITDA) target in the intermediate-term. Fitch expects annual FCF of $1.5 billion to $2 billion beyond the near term, during which Fitch believes the vast majority of cash restructuring costs will largely offset recurring FCF. Until Western Digital achieves the 1.5x total leverage target, Fitch expects the company will limit share repurchases to offsetting dilution. --Significant Technology Risk: Fitch believes Western Digital is subject to significant technology risk from the storage industry's rapid evolution and emergence of new storage architectures. Western Digital's strategy of layering optimized software onto hybrid HDDs/SSDs for next generation platform solutions shifts the company's focus to hyper-scale and traditional data center markets but also intensifies technology risk related to a wider array of competitors with alternative technologies. --3D NAND Roadmap: Fitch believes Western Digital could structurally trail competitors in 3D NAND-based products and solutions through the intermediate term, potentially adversely impacting operating results and reducing FCF for debt reduction. Western Digital plans to ship meaningful volumes of its next generation 3D NAND technology, BiCS3, in the first half of calendar 2017, while Samsung, Micron and Intel currently are shipping 3D NAND. Western Digital is accelerating fab conversion to 3D from 2D NAND to increase the mix of 3D NAND to approximately 40% of total wafer capacity by the end of 2017, in line with the industry. --Revenue Pressures and Volatility: Fitch expects Western Digital will face near- to intermediate-term revenue pressures and that increased exposure to datacenter spending should amplify volatility. Fitch expects the continuation of negative PC unit growth and increased SSD cannibalization of HDDs in PCs and performance enterprise. Fitch expects SanDisk's removable retail business will continue being pressured by the increased use of cloud based storage and the decreased use of single function electronic devices, such as cameras. Meanwhile, a sales mix shift to datacenters should improve visibility but also add top line volatility from capex cycles. Beyond the next two years, Fitch anticipates low- to mid-single digit organic revenue growth from market growth in datacenters and enterprise markets. --High Leverage Reduces Flexibility: Leverage was a Fitch estimated just over 4x for fiscal 2016, excluding expected cost synergies but pro forma for the repayment of the Bridge Loan and refinancing and $750 million Term Loan B repayment. Including cost synergies, Fitch estimates leverage closer to 3.5x. Fitch believes reducing leverage is imperative for Western Digital, as investments in innovation, including potential IP-driven acquisitions, are critical to long-term success given rapid technology evolution. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Low-single digit organic revenue growth in 2017 and mid-single revenue growth in 2018, driven by client SSD unit growth, moderating PC unit declines, and significant data growth driving enterprise SSD and nearline HDD unit growth; --Significant synergies related to Western Digital's integration of Hitachi and SanDisk driving meaningful profit margin expansion, despite pressures in the removable retail business and core NAND markets such as smartphones; --Repatriation of foreign cash for debt prepayment; --No increases to the dividend or share repurchases beyond anti-dilution until the company achieves its target leverage of 1.5x. RATING SENSITIVITIES The ratings may be downgraded if Fitch expects: --Sustained negative revenue growth, likely from i) slower than anticipated growth within enterprise that is insufficient to offset the secular decline in PCs and the removable storage market, or ii) market share losses to competing technologies, including 3D NAND; or --Slower than expected debt reduction resulting in total leverage sustained above 3x. Positive rating actions would require Fitch's expectations for: --Consistently positive mid-cycle organic revenue growth from successful implementation of the company's strategy, including increased penetration in enterprise growth markets by leveraging its technology stack; and --Western Digital to reach 1.5x total leverage from significant voluntary debt reduction. LIQUIDITY Fitch believes Western Digital's liquidity was adequate as of July 1, 2016 and consisted of: --$8.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, $1.3 billion of which located in the U.S. and $3 billion of which was used to repay the $3 billion Bridge Loan; --An undrawn and fully available $1 billion Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility expiring April 29, 2021. Fitch's expectations for $1.5 billion to $2 billion of annual FCF beyond the near term also support liquidity.

(AFP/Lars Hagberg) Newsroom Email the Newsroom Facebook Twitter Related Topics Canada IS Islamic State jihadists Related Stories French mayor bans burqinis on Cannes beaches Argentina identifies last victim of AMIA bombing, 22 years on Bombing in Thai seaside resort town kills 1, injures 20 Uproar over Egypt’s policy of state-dictated Friday sermons At least 7 civilians dead, dozens wounded in two attacks in Turkey Two planes land safely in Brussels after bomb threats UK Labour event drops Israeli-linked firm, loses security Duma survivor Ahmed Dawabsha rehospitalized with fever, infections Video appears to confirm use of attack drones by Hezbollah The Islamic State’s news agency claimed Thursday that a Canadian man killed by police a day earlier was a member of the jihadist group and acting on its general instructions. Aaron Driver, 24, was killed Wednesday during a police raid outside the home where he was staying with his sister in the town of Strathroy, Ontario, after he detonated a small explosive in the back seat of a cab. He was detained last year for pro-IS media posts, and an investigation has revealed his extensive ties to foreign jihadists. An unnamed source told the Amaq Agency that Driver “was a soldier of the Islamic State and carried out the operation in response to call to target coalition countries.” Referring to #AaronDriver, #ISIS 'Amaq Agency called him a "soldier of the Islamic State" #Canada pic.twitter.com/s7RIv5PYyx — SITE Intel Group (@siteintelgroup) August 11, 2016 Police said they acted to thwart an imminent “potential terrorist threat.” Driver first came to the attention of authorities in October 2014 with tweets in support of IS and justifying the killing of a soldier standing guard at the Canadian National War Memorial in Ottawa by a young Muslim convert. In June 2015, a court ordered him to undergo religious counseling, wear an electronic monitoring bracelet and stay off the internet. Those restrictions were gradually loosened and were scheduled to expire this month. A convert to Islam, Driver’s views had apparently become increasingly radical after he began following the war in Syria online. “If a country goes to war with another country or another people or another community, I think that they have to be prepared for things like” the October 22, 2014 attack in Ottawa, Driver told the CBC. “And when it does happen they shouldn’t, they shouldn’t act surprised. They had it coming to them; they deserved it.” Still, he publicly disavowed violence. “I don’t think there’s a reason for Canadians to think that I’m a threat,” he said. The RCMP, however, revealed that Driver had been in “fairly constant contact” with violent extremists around the world. They included two members of the Islamic State group, a British youth arrested for his involvement in a terror plot targeting Australia, and Elton Simpson — one of two Americans who launched an attack on a Texas exhibition of caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed last year. Investigators searching Driver’s home in 2015 found a recipe for homemade bombs on his computer. In a video released by the RCMP on Thursday, Driver warned Canadians: “You have Muslim blood on your hands and for this we will have your blood.” He called Canadians and their allies “mischief makers” who spread “oppression and corruption.” “You will pay for everything that you have done against us,” he said, dressed in black clothes and a balaclava. According to Canadian media, Driver converted to Islam in his teens after a difficult childhood and a split with his father. Public broadcaster CBC said his mother died when he was seven years old. Driver and his father — a Canadian soldier — recounted last year in interviews with the CBC how their relationship had become strained. The father, whose name was withheld, said his son had become increasingly withdrawn. “It was like he turned out the lights and put a ‘Do Not Disturb’ sign on the door,” the father told CBC. “When he was living at home, he was very secretive; a lone wolf. He didn’t bring friends over, never talked about where he was going and what he was doing,” Driver’s father said. Driver lived away from home during most of his teenage years. At age 17 he turned to religion. Baptized Christian in his birth province of Saskatchewan, he started reading the Bible, he said, but added “I just decided it couldn’t possibly be the word of God.” After exploring other religions, he converted to Islam.

The benches appeared on Ashes of the Singularity‘s benchmark database this week, and seem to originate from the engineering sample. While not indicative of AMD Zen’s final form, they give a good indication of where the company is headed prior to the platform’s reported 2017 launch. According to WCCFTech (who snagged a few screens of the benches before they were taken down), there are two engineering samples being tested here. One is a hyper-threaded octa-core, with 16 total threads and a base clock of 2.8GHz (which turbos up to 3.2GHz). There’s also an AMD RX 480 GPU to help the system through the Ashes of the Singularity benchmark. And the results? According to similar systems on the database running the RX 480 at 1080p, the AMD Zen does rather well. It manages an average system framerate of 58 fps, second to only the Intel Core i7 4790 (65 fps). The Zen is also faster than the Intel Core i5 4670K, which managed just 52 fps on a similar system. More impressive yet is AMD Zen’s performance compared to its older peers, notably the 4.2GHz FX-8300. The latter could only manage a steady 42 fps, with nearly a GHz difference in potential clock speed. That at least points to promising performance for the AMD Zen chip. Although we can’t draw any conclusions from these numbers, it is key to note that this could be the first AMD chip in a day and age that can perform alongside its Intel contemporaries. And if AMD can somehow undercut Intel in terms of price, AMD may just rise from its slow-burning ashes. But that’s for 2017’s silicon gods to answer. For now, have a look at WCCFTech’s full report.

The 480 is great for the price but it draws way to much power and isn’t even all that fast. Yea it outshines the 1060 for now in dx12 but lets see what happens when there are more dx12 games.

La Monica   @lamonicabuzz August 11, 2016: 12:14 PM ET America's top retailers in trouble These are tough times for people working at department stores and other big mall-based retailers. Macy's (M) announced on Thursday that it plans to close 100 stores. The company didn't give any details about how many people would lose their jobs. But more and more department stores that are mall stalwarts, companies like Macy's, JCPenney (JCP), Sears (SHLD) and Kohl's (KSS), are losing customers -- and laying off workers. According to figures from job placement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, more than 43,600 layoffs have been announced in the retail sector so far this year. The only two sectors to cut more jobs in 2016 are energy -- due to the massive drop in oil prices over the past two years -- and computers, largely a reflection of layoffs at Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30), IBM (IBM, Tech30), Intel (INTC, Tech30) and other old school tech giants. Retail's biggest problem is the shift in how -- and where -- people shop. More consumers are shopping online as opposed to at brick and mortar stores. Related: Macy's closing another 100 stores "The traditional retail industry in some respects is facing Armageddon. There were far too many stores built," said Mark Cohen, professor and director of retail studies at Columbia Business School. Macy's set to close 100 stores It's no secret that department stores have lost ground to online retail king Amazon. The success of Amazon is a big reason why Walmart just bought hot e-commerce startup Jet.com for more than $3 billion. Shopping online is an international phenomenon, too. China's Alibaba just reported strong results on Thursday. But Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) and Alibaba (BABA, Tech30) aren't the only reason that Macy's and other traditional retailers are closing up shop and letting employees go -- or going bankrupt, like Sports Authority, Aeropostale and Pacific Sunwear. Consumers are increasingly interested in bargain hunting. It makes sense given how sluggish the overall economy is. Discount retailers like TJX (TJX) -- which owns T.J. Maxx and Marshalls -- Ross Stores (ROST), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Dollar General (DG) are doing well. And Walmart (WMT) is rebounding after a miserable 2015. Related: More trouble at the mall. Gap sales sink again Cohen said that more and more retailers are racing to the bottom -- and are being forced to slash prices to attract customers. "Black Friday starts at Labor Day now," Cohen quipped. The rise of so-called fast fashion is also eating into sales at department stores, as well as once hot clothing retailers like Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) and Gap (GPS). Meanwhile, H&M, Zara and Forever 21 are all doing extremely well. So it may be a mistake to say that all malls are dying -- and that consumers have stopped spending. Yes, many malls are in trouble, especially in big cities. But malls in the more affluent suburbs are merely evolving. Think of all the malls that now have Apple (AAPL, Tech30) Stores as big tenants instead of Macy's. Other retailers outside of the bargain basement realm are still doing extremely well, too. Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW) are thriving as consumers invest more in sprucing up their home or apartment instead of buying new clothes, toys or handbags. That's why it's important to take a look at the bigger picture in retail. Even though the loss of nearly 44,000 traditional retail jobs is bad news for the U.S. economy, other retailers are still in hiring mode. According to the official jobs figures from the government, retailers have added nearly 200,000 jobs this year. This category includes the struggling department stores, but also auto dealers, home improvement chains, supermarkets and "non-store retailers" -- a sub sector that includes Amazon and other e-commerce players. The non-store retailers have added nearly 15,000 jobs this year. Furniture and home furnishing stores have added almost 17,000 jobs. Electronics stores have added more than 4,500 jobs. Related: Why Americans are no longer shopping til they drop The overall retail business isn't going the way of the dinosaur or dodo. But some retailers are. "The retail business is not dead, but some legacy retailers are dying," Columbia's Cohen said.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Microsoft extends support for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 on Intel Skylake devices 0 by Pradeep  @pradeepviswav Aug 11, 2016 at 17:04 GMT3 months ago Earlier this year, Microsoft announced that they will only support select Skylake PCs on Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. Also, they listed over 100 models of PCs with Intel’s 6th generation of processor(Skylake), that will be supported on Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. And support for these PCs will be provided until July 17, 2017. Later, they announced changes to the previous announcement by extending the support for 1 more year. Today, they are making changes to this support policy once again. This change is designed to help our customers purchase modern hardware with confidence, while continuing to manage their migrations to Windows 10. There are now over 350 million devices on Windows 10 and more than 135 billion hours of use since the launch, with enterprise customers deploying Windows 10 to devices every day. We recommend that customers upgrade these 6th Gen Intel Core systems on Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 as soon as possible so that they can receive full support along with the great enhancements that come from running modern hardware with modern software. This policy change primarily applies to commercial customers who are currently managing deployments with Windows 7 and Windows 8.1, and does not apply to customers running Windows 10. Today Windows 7 is in extended support and support will end for Windows 7 on January 14, 2020, and support for Windows 8.1 will end January 10, 2023. 6th Gen Intel Core devices on Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 will be supported with all applicable security updates until the end of support for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. This change is made possible through the strong partnership with our OEM partners and Intel who will be performing security update validation testing and upgrade testing for 6th Gen Intel Core systems running Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 through the end of support dates. As previously communicated earlier this year, future silicon platforms including Intel’s upcoming 7th Gen Intel Core (Kaby Lake) processor family and AMD’s 7th generation processors (e.g. Bristol Ridge) will only be supported on Windows 10, and all future silicon releases will require the latest release of Windows 10.

Retail earnings have also been encouraging. The domestic markets could attempt to break out of the recent lackluster trading phase, although overbought levels might put a lid on the gains.   U.S. stocks retreated on Wednesday, coming under pressure on valuation concerns, with oil's slide providing a reason for liquidating holdings. The major averages opened higher and held above the unchanged line in late morning trading. After slipping below the unchanged, the averages moved roughly sideways for the rest of the session.    The Dow Industrials ended down 37.39 points or 0.20 percent at 18,496, the S&P 500 Index closed 6.25 points or 0.29 percent lower at 2,176 and the Nasdaq Composite closed at 5,205, down 20.90 points or 0.40 percent.    Sixteen of the thirty Dow components declined, while the remaining fourteen stocks advanced. Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), Nike (NKE), Intel (INTC), American Express (AXP) and JP Morgan Chase (JPM) fell steeply, while Disney (DIS) and Wal-Mart (WMT) gained ground.    Among the sectors, biotechnology, oil service, banking and oil stocks came under selling pressure, while gold stocks advanced.    Currency, Commodity Markets    Crude oil is currently slipping $0.12 to $41.59 a barrel. The September futures ended the previous session down $1.06 at $41.71 a barrel. The drop seen in the previous session came following the release of the weekly petroleum status report for the week ended August 5th, which showed that crude oil stockpiles increased by 1.1 million barrels to 523.60 million barrels. Stockpiles were at historically high levels for this time of year.  Meanwhile, gasoline inventories fell by 2.8 million barrels but were well above the upper limit of the average range. Distillate inventories declined by 2 million barrels, dropping to levels near the upper limit of the average range for this time of the year  Refinery capacity utilization averaged 92.8 percent over the four weeks ended August 5th compared to 92.6 percent for the four weeks ended July 29th. Gold futures are currently trading at $1,351.40 an ounce, down $0.50 from the previous session's close of $1,351.90 an ounce. On Wednesday, gold gained $5.20. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 101.30 yen compared to the 101.29 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Wednesday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.1158 compared to yesterday's $1.1176. Asia    The major Asian closed mixed on a fairly quiet day, with the Japanese market closed for a public holiday. The Australian, Chinese and Taiwanese markets retreated, while most other major markets moved to the upside. Even as the negative lead from Wall Street and oil's weakness pressured stocks, traders derived some encouragement from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand trimming its official cash rate.    Australian stocks retreated, as oil's drop weighed on the market. The All Ordinaries Index opened lower and languished below the unchanged line throughout the session before ending down 28.80 points or 0.51 percent at 5,599, falling for the second straight session.    Utility, telecom, financial and energy stocks fell steeply, but IT and consumer discretionary stocks saw strength.    China's Shanghai Composite ended at 3,003, up 16.11 points or 0.53 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index closed at a 1-week high of 22,581, up 88.12 points or 0.39 percent.    On the economic front, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand lowered its Official Cash Rate by 25 basis points to a new record low of 2.00 percent, with the central bank attributing the decision partly to low inflation. The decision was in line with expectations and came after the central bank held fire for two straight months.    The Ministry of Trade and Industry of Singapore reported that GDP in Singapore rose 2.1 percent year-over-year in the second quarter following a 1.8 percent increase in the first quarter. On an annualized quarterly basis, GDP rose 0.3 percent, faster than the 0.1 percent increase in the first quarter.     Europe    European stocks saw volatility in early trading, as traders react to mixed earnings news and oil's weakness.  The French and German markets have since then seen solid gains, while the U.K. Market is lower.   In major corporate news, Thyssenkrupp reported a drop in third quarter profits, weighed down by weak steel prices, although the decline was not as steep as feared. Deutsche Telekom's second quarter profits also fell, but the company confirmed its guidance for the full year. K+S issued weak full year profit guidance, blaming it on lower potash prices.     Henkel reported strong second quarter results and raised its margin guidance for the full year. RWE reported a decline in first half profits, weighed by weakness at its trading business. The company confirmed its full year outlook.     TUI AG lowered its sales growth outlook for the year. Glencore reported declines in copper production for the second quarter. Among insurers, Aegon reported a wider than expected loss for its second quarter, while Zurich Insurance reported a higher operating profit.     On the economic front, the results of a survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors showed that housing activity in the U.K. slowed in July. The house price balance came in at +5 following a reading of +15 in June, while economists expected a reading of +6.    U.S. Economic Reports    First-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits edged slightly lower in the week ended August 6th, according to a report released by the Labor Department. The report said initial jobless claims slipped to 266,000, a decrease of 1,000 from the previous week's revised level of 267,000. Economists had expected jobless claims to dip to 265,000 from the 269,000 originally reported for the previous week. With an increase in non-fuel prices more than offsetting a downturn in fuel prices, the Labor Department released a separate report unexpectedly showing an uptick in U.S. import prices in the month of July.   The report said import prices inched up by 0.1 percent in July after climbing by an upwardly revised 0.6 percent in June. Import prices had been expected to drop by 0.4 percent compared to the 0.2 percent increase that had been reported for the previous month. The Labor Department also said export prices rose by 0.2 percent in July after advancing by 0.8 percent in June. The Treasury Department is set to announce the results of its auction of 30-year bonds at 1 pm ET.    Stocks in Focus  Alibaba (BABA) reported better than expected first quarter results. Kohl's (KSS) reported better than expected results but it trimmed its adjusted earnings per share guidance, which however is in line. Macy's (M) also reported better than expected second quarter results and announced plans to shut down 100 full-line stores. A. Schulman (SHLM) lowered its adjusted earnings per share for the full year, citing deteriorating market conditions facing the industry in its largest regions in the U.S. and Europe.   Dillard's (DDS), Nordstrom (JWN), NVIDIA (NVDA) and Ruby Tuesday (RT) are among the companies due to release their quarterly results after the close of trading. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com The Worst IPO flops of 2016 Preview: Thanksgiving Week Economic Data Top Ten Corporate Comeback Stories Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Offices Of Samsung, Pension Fund Raided Over Scandal Involving President Infineon Sees Higher FY17 Revenues, Raises Margin View, Despite Weak Q4 Profit Volkswagen Brand Focuses On Electric Cars, US In Transformation Plan Twitter Suspends CEO Jack Dorsey's Account Briefly HP Q4 Profit Meets View - Update What's In The Offing For These Biotech Stocks?

Download Drivers for Acer’s Aspire XC-603 and XC-603G Desktops The files are suitable for Windows 7, 8.1, and 10 platforms Aug 11, 2016 12:42 GMT  ·  By Iulian Pascal  ·  Share:  Since Acer has provided all drivers required by its Aspire XC-603 and XC-603G desktop models to run at their best and provide maximum performance, stability, and usability, we have gathered them all in a single list so that owners of these Acer products can easily set up their devices. In terms of compatibility, the desktops, as well as their drivers, are suitable only for the 64-bit variant of Microsoft’s Windows 7, 8.1, and 10 platforms. Trying to apply them on other operating systems isn’t recommended and might lead to various malfunctions. In terms of the producers providing these files, know that Intel has put on the line its Chipset, USB 3.0, TXE (Trusted Execution Engine), and AMT (Active Management) packages while Realtek will enable the full functionality of the Ethernet, card reader, and audio components. Moving forward, Realtek, along with Atheros, ensures the well-functioning of the device’s wireless capabilities (WLAN and Bluetooth). Moreover, Intel installs its HD Graphics build to improve the CPU’s gaming performance while AMD wakes up the dedicated video card so that owners can take details to a whole new level (however, it depends on what GPU model you have). That said, if you own one of these devices (or intend to buy them), download Acer Aspire XC-603 Drivers or download Acer Aspire XC-603G Drivers, apply them, perform a reboot upon completion, and check our website as often as possible to stay up to speed with the latest releases. #Aspire XC-603#Aspire XC-603G#Drivers#Acer#Desktop reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Download Drivers for Acer’s TravelMate X483 and X483G Notebooks Download All Drivers for Acer’s TravelMate P246-M Notebooks Download Drivers for Acer’s TravelMate P245 Notebook Models Download All Drivers for Acer’s TravelMate B117-M Notebooks Donald Trump, Tim Cook Discuss Building iPhones in the United States iPhone 8 to Feature Traditional Wireless Charging like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Lenovo Builds a New Microsoft Surface Clone and It Looks Fabulous Anonymous Hackers Want McAfee to Be Trump’s Security Adviser, Call for March Download Windows 10 64-bit Drivers for Acer’s Aspire TC-710 Desktop Model Intel Rolls Out Several New BIOS Versions for Its NUC Kits and Compute Sticks ASRock Rolls Out New BIOS Updates for IMB-791, IMB-380-L, and IMB-370-L Boards Leica S (Typ 007) Camera Receives New Firmware - Download Version 4.1.0.0    Acer Aspire XC-603 New Apps Seymour: Browse through, edit, convert and arrange your photo collection in categories based on the author with this user-friendly application Your Freedom: A all-in-one VPN tunneling, firewall and proxy bypassing, anonymization and anti-censorship solution that enables you to browse the Internet in a secure way Dopamine Portable: Seamlessly organize your music collection and find your favorite tracks based on title, artists, genres, albums or playlists with this software solution Farbar Recovery Scan Tool: Lightweight and efficient application that was designed to help you scan your computer for malware damage and resolve encountered issues Dopamine: Keep your music collection neatly organized based on albums, genre, playlists or tracks so you easily find tracks using this music player Vectorworks: Designed for professionals, this application enables you to create architectural designs, landscapes, theatrical productions and more Portable PhotoLine: A simple to use application bundled with photo editing functions that allows you to enhance, distort, as well as paint over an opened picture Reader comments NVIDIA Makes Available New GeForce Graphics Hotfix Driver - Version 375.95 more on: 375.95 Hotfix i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Sixa is a full computer that operates right from the cloud via a client app. It includes your choice of hardware and software and is capable of running the most demanding applications. The Company allows users to access a powerful computer in the cloud for complex tasks such as video-editing, design, 3-D modelling, development, gaming or VR. Sixa offers custom computers for developers, designers, and gamers, and each comes with preinstalled software for their specific use cases. Cloud computer can be accessed from any device with a wifi connection. Users can access the service through multiple platforms, including web, PC, Mac, iOS and Android. “Usually, when it comes to multimedia content, remote desktop protocols start to lag, drop the frames, and degrade the picture quality, the sound will be bad, or there will be no sound at all,” Mykola Minchenko, Sixa CEO, explained. “We wanted to change this because we thought of having the user experience from working on the cloud computer without traditional remote desktop protocol limitations.” Sixa computers have an Intel Xeon E5-2666 v3 (Haswell) processor, 30GB of RAM, 200GB SSD Disk, Windows 2012 R2, and pre-installed software including FileZilla, Ruby, Visual Studio 2015 Community, Microsoft OneDrive, Adobe Flash, Google Chrome, Firefox, Dropbox, Silverlight, .NET, and Atom. Unlike other cloud computing services SIXA has external devices support, Full HD screen and unlimited resolution. “We’ve seen how lower server and storage costs and increased accessibility to the Internet have empowered tech startups to build great, valuable businesses,” says Adora Cheung, Partner at Y Combinator, where Sixa was accepted in May 2016. “We’re excited to see Sixa further lower the barrier for entrepreneurs to build even more powerful applications and solve the difficulty of building across the ever-growing fragmentation of new game-changing technologies.” For more information, please contact Kateryna Kondrunina or visit Sixa online. Sixa Screenshot Screenshot Sixa, Inc. was founded in September 2015 and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. The company is a graduate of Startupbootcamp Istanbul acceleration program (September – December 2015) and has been backed by Y Combinator to join its Summer 2016 batch.

You get one drink if you’re lucky. Wi-Fi is available, but you’d be crazy to pay for it. recommends 2016 HP Chromebook 13 7/10 Learn How We Rate Wired Clean, business-casual design. Solid battery life. Good keyboard, good speakers, good performance. It can be your only computer, because Chrome OS is so much more than a browser. Tired The trackpad sometimes feels and works like something's gone horribly wrong. You might not want a touchscreen now, but you will soon. Buy It Now   |  HP How We Rate 1/10A complete failure in every way 2/10Sad, really 3/10Serious flaws; proceed with caution 4/10Downsides outweigh upsides 5/10Recommended with reservations 6/10Solid with some issues 7/10Very good, but not quite great 8/10Excellent, with room to kvetch 9/10Nearly flawless 10/10Metaphysical perfection A few seconds after takeoff, I didn’t know quite what to expect as I reached into my bag for HP’s new Chromebook 13. I had work to do, but couldn’t remember if I’d saved the right Google Docs to work offline. I had a movie, but the last time I tested a Chromebook on a plane it couldn’t even play back 1080p. The biggest knock on Google’s Chrome OS always has been that it’s useless offline—it’s just a browser, after all, and what good is a browser without an Internet connection? Luckily, I’d been upgraded to first class (Gold Medallion FTW), so worst-case I’d stash the computer and pound bad wine for an hour. When I opened the Chromebook 13 and entered my password, the computer sprang to life. All my docs and files were there. Interstellar played beautifully on the gorgeous high-res screen. When I selected a Google Doc, it opened in a tab, and the only sign that I was offline was a small lightning bolt alongside the document’s name. Forty-five minutes later, I closed the lid and returned my tray table to its upright and locked position. I’d barely tapped the battery. The $499 Chromebook 13 is, in many ways, the Chromebook you’ve been waiting for. It falls between Google’s glorious, preposterously expensive Chromebook Pixel, and everyone else’s craptastic Chromebooks. Google and HP desperately want to prove Chromebooks can be more than cheap, student-friendly laptops. This is a Business Laptop, a Primary Device, a laptop to use as your only machine. They kind of pulled it off. The machine looks high-end: Brushed metal, monochrome logos, just one or two stupid stickers that take entirely too much effort to peel off the palmrest. It’s a half-inch thick and a bit less than three pounds, which isn’t small but doesn’t feel any bigger than a MacBook Air. The Chromebook 13 is understated and polished. It looks like an upper-middle-class Windows PC, which I suspect is exactly what HP was going for. It uses low-power versions of Intel’s latest Skylake chips, which are more than adequate for keeping up with the three dozen or so browser tabs I usually have going. (My review unit sports a Core M5 processor, 8GB of RAM, and 32GB of storage. At $819, it’s the most expensive model, and overkill. Get the cheapest one with the great screen.) Most of the processor’s effort goes toward powering the 13.3-inch screen, a gorgeous 3200×1800 panel that looks just a bit oversaturated but is as good as any laptop screen out there. It’s not a touchscreen, which you’ll hardly notice now but will almost certainly miss later. The speakers are fine, and the webcam isn’t a total horror show. The battery lasts eight to nine hours. The $499 Chromebook 13 is, in many ways, the Chromebook you’ve been waiting for. Switching to the Chromebook 13 might be easier than getting used to, say, Apple’s new MacBook. For one thing, it has ports, plural: two USB-C and one USB 3, along with a microSD slot. You can charge your computer and connect a hard drive at the same time. What a world! The keyboard, too, is so much deeper and more tactile that you’ll figure it out long before your adapt to the MacBook’s membrane mashers. The keys do bottom out harshly when you whack ’em hard, but at least you’re hitting the right keys. The trackpad is the only truly bad thing about the Chromebook 13. It’s often so rough and jumpy that I end up clicking daintily, making a face I’d probably make if I ever had to defuse a bomb, hoping I don’t accidentally delete something while trying to click “Bold.” When I do click, the trackpad crunches, like there’s a Cheerio under there. Still, the Chromebook 13 is more than enough laptop for most people, at a price most people can stomach. Chrome OS is the same deal: If you don’t think you can do everything in a browser, well, you’re probably wrong. You probably do everything in a browser already, unless your life requires Photoshop or Premiere or some other $800 software. (In that case, you could buy an iPad and a Chromebook 13 and still save money, but I digress.) I absolutely could switch to a Chromebook. I spent more than a week using this one for work, for Netflix, for everything. It could do anything I needed. What I missed, coming from the Macs I’ve used for a decade, was the fiddly stuff—the keyboard shortcuts, the crazy file system, the superpowered multitasking and window management. I hated not being able to type “ship” and have it populate my shipping address. Most of all, I missed having 1Password, but then 1Password launched a web app! Big day. Yes, switching to a Chromebook takes work, and Chrome OS feels less powerful than macOS or Windows. But almost nobody cares. Yes, switching to a Chromebook takes work, and Chrome OS feels less powerful than macOS or Windows. But almost nobody cares. Most people don’t use Alfred or Atext, or go to great lengths to master Evernote’s global keyboard shortcuts. They just want a good computer at a good price. The HP Chromebook 13 is exactly that. There are cheaper Chromebooks (the Asus Chromebook Flip is a good one), but they’re ugly and compromised. There’s a cooler Chromebook with a better trackpad, but it’s much more expensive. HP threw this one right down the middle and nailed it. If you’re looking for a new computer and have $500 to spend, this is the one to buy. For now, anyway. This is where things get sort of weird. Right now, you don’t really need a touchscreen on a Chromebook. But this fall, when Chrome OS and Android begin their conscious coupling and the Google Play store comes to Chrome OS, you’ll have literally millions of reasons to want one. (HP says the next Chromebook 13 will have one.) Over the next few months, Android apps will force Chromebook makers to reconsider absolutely everything about their devices. We’ll see new form factors, new sensors, new ideas about what a laptop even is when a laptop can run smartphone apps. If you can wait to buy a Chromebook, sit tight. If you can’t, buy this one.

Inside, it can be configured with up to Intel's new Core i7 6820HK processor, and we should feature NVIDIA's next-gen GeForce GTX 10 series GPU.     MSI's upcoming GT72VR Dominator gaming laptop stood out for me, as it will reportedly feature a 120Hz display, which MSI says is "the fastest mobile display". This excites me beyond belief, as it'll be the first gaming laptop with a super-fast 120Hz refresh rate on a gaming notebook.   There will also be a 4K IPS panel offering, with MSI promising 100% Adobe RGB. Inside, MSI will include upgraded audio technologies with sound from Dynaudio, and the GT83VR and GT73VR Titan gaming laptops featuring Nahimic 2 and Audio Boost 2 technologies.   MSI is expected to unveil their new gaming laptops in the coming weeks.

Kyiv denies these allegations.  UPDATE: The brother of Yevhen Panov, who was detained and charged by Russian authorities with preparing terror attacks in Crimea, has asked Ukrainian officials for help in securing his release. Panov, a Ukrainian citizen, is being held on the Crimean peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014. Yevhen Panov is a Ukrainian truck driver who previously volunteered in the conflict zone in eastern Ukraine. Moscow claims Panov worked as a Ukrainian military intelligence officer, Kyiv denies the allegations. His brother Igor Kotelyanets spoke to RFE/RL's Current Time TV. Yevhen Panov is so far the only man that Russia has officially named among the several arrested alleged ‘terrorists'. Moscow claims that Panov, born in Zaporizhia, works for Ukraine's Intelligence service, the agency which trained the so-called sabotage group and, ultimately, organized the ‘terror acts' in Crimea. Learn how the events unfolded in the alleged terrorist attack in Crimea  Russia media released images of Panov, escorted by FSB. There are bruises on his face. According to the Kremlin, Panov has been interrogated and ‘is making a confession". Ukraine, in turn, categorically denies that Panov is a member of the Intel service. Igor Kotelianets says he is the brother of the arrested man. He has a different version of what has happened. Read also: An August Surprise from Russia? ‘I still cannot believe that this is real. My brother has been kidnapped. There is no other way for him to end up in Crimea' Kotelianets posted on Facebook. After Russian aggression started, Panov joined the ranks of the army. Upon his return from the conflict zone, he became a technician at the nuclear power plant in Zaporizhia while being a volunteer and helping the servicemen. "He would never go to Crimea. Yevhen always said that Crimea was gone and he was indifferent towards this fact", Kotelianets says in an interview with Ukrainian media outlet Censor.net.ua Read also: Putin raises stakes over alleged Ukrainian terror plot in Crimea - Guardian Kotelianets tells in an interview with Ukrainian media outlets, prior to the incident his brother was going to spend his time with friends and come back home Monday, but he never did.

Microsoft Surface Book 2 Could Launch with Redesigned Hinge, Kaby Lake CPUs GO New info emerges on 2nd-generation ultimate laptop Aug 11, 2016 05:16 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Microsoft is expected to launch the new Surface Book 2 laptop in the fall of this year, and since we’re getting closer to the rumored unveiling date, more information arrives to provide us with a glimpse into what the new device could bring to the market. First and foremost, it’s worth noting from the very beginning that the Surface Book 2 won’t be a massive redesign of the first generation, but will come with upgraded hardware and small refinements here and there, including the hinge. One of the most plausible rumors concerns the upcoming line of CPUs, with WindowsCentral claiming that Microsoft is pondering launching the Surface Book 2 with the Kaby Lake lineup of processors. Intel’s new chips are not yet available but are expected to see daylight later this year, so Microsoft might be trying to align the release of its second-generation laptop with the one of Kaby Lake. If this is true, the laptop could benefit from a wide range of improvements allowed by the CPU, including 3D and 4K graphics, as well as USB 3.1 support - this is very likely to be offered, especially given that Microsoft is building the Surface Book to offer as many connectivity options as possible. Redesigned hinge In terms of design, the Surface Book 2 will come with only small improvements over its predecessor, but it turns out that one of these improvements concerns the hinge. Although it was introduced with much fanfare by Microsoft at the October 2015 hardware event, the hinge has become a rather controversial feature, with many people criticizing this design choice and claiming not only that it’s ugly but also that it allows dust to easily slip in between the keyboard and the display. While these claims are more or less well founded, it appears that Microsoft wants to deal with the problem once and for all, so the Surface Book 2 will introduce a redesigned hinge that eliminates the gap between the screen and the keyboard when the laptop is closed. It remains to be seen how much of these rumors is true, but at first glance, all these upgrades really make sense, given the fact that Microsoft wants to improve its products based on customer feedback. #Microsoft#Surface#Surface Book#Surface Book 2#Microsoft Surface subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Microsoft Band 2 Now Super Cheap in the US As Third Generation Debut Nears Microsoft Launches Panorama Feature for Windows 10 Mobile Phones Microsoft Releases BSOD Fix for Windows 10 Anniversary Update Builds on Surface Microsoft Announces FY16 Q4 Results, Reveals Strong Windows Performance Donald Trump, Tim Cook Discuss Building iPhones in the United States iPhone 8 to Feature Traditional Wireless Charging like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Lenovo Builds a New Microsoft Surface Clone and It Looks Fabulous Anonymous Hackers Want McAfee to Be Trump’s Security Adviser, Call for March HTC Desire 650 Announced, a Low Mid-End Smartphone for the Masses Glossy Black Galaxy S7 edge Leaks in Live Pictures Download Windows 10 64-bit Drivers for Acer’s Aspire TC-710 Desktop Model Intel Rolls Out Several New BIOS Versions for Its NUC Kits and Compute Sticks    The Surface Book and its controversial hinge New Apps Seymour: Browse through, edit, convert and arrange your photo collection in categories based on the author with this user-friendly application Your Freedom: A all-in-one VPN tunneling, firewall and proxy bypassing, anonymization and anti-censorship solution that enables you to browse the Internet in a secure way Dopamine Portable: Seamlessly organize your music collection and find your favorite tracks based on title, artists, genres, albums or playlists with this software solution Farbar Recovery Scan Tool: Lightweight and efficient application that was designed to help you scan your computer for malware damage and resolve encountered issues Dopamine: Keep your music collection neatly organized based on albums, genre, playlists or tracks so you easily find tracks using this music player Vectorworks: Designed for professionals, this application enables you to create architectural designs, landscapes, theatrical productions and more Portable PhotoLine: A simple to use application bundled with photo editing functions that allows you to enhance, distort, as well as paint over an opened picture Reader comments Load old comments   US President-Elect Donald Trump Can’t End Russia’s War Against American Software more on: Microsoft i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Make programs 5x faster - the easy way Download OpenCL - 666.4 KB Download demo - 49.1 KB Introduction This project is going to show you that a modern Core I7 is probably the slowest piece of programmable hardware you have in your PC. Modern Quad Core CPUs have about 6 Gflops whereas modern GPUs have about 6Tflops of computational power. This project can dynamically execute simple programs written in a C dialect (OpenCL C) on your GPU, CPU or both. They are compiled and executed at run time. This is also going to show that GPU programming does not have to be hard. In fact, you only need a little bit of basic programming skills for this project. If you want to skip the introduction and dive into using this, feel free to download the source code. Do I Need This? Your computer is a very powerful machine. By using only the CPU to execute tasks, you might waste about 90% of its potential. If you have a piece of code which is concurrent and you want to speed it up, this is the right project for you. Ideally, all your data fits into some float or other numeric arrays. Examples for a potential speed up would be: Work on pictures or movies Any work that can be done parallel Do hard number crunching on your GPU Save energy and time by using GPU and CPU in parallel Use your GPU for any task and have your CPU free to do something else Keep in mind that this project uses OpenCL. Unlike Cuda, it runs on any GPU (Amd, Nvidia, Intel) and also on the CPU. So any program you write can be used on any device. (Even phones) These are the results for simple prime calculation: As you can see, you really can speed up your program a LOT. Native C# is 5x slower than the best speed you can get on your PC. This is not even the best case scenario. The speedup factor can approach 500x in pure multiply add workloads. (GPUs really shine in this domain). If there are many ifs, the CPU can be better sometimes. Most importantly, it is really easy to write a program for your GPU and CPU with this class. How Do I Use It? OpenCL programming can be a very time consuming task. This helper project will reduce your programming overhead so that you can concentrate on the core problem. It is written in C# but could be adapted to any .NET language and also C++. Imagine you wanted to know all prime numbers from 2 to 10^8. Here is a simple implementation in C# (yes, I know there are much better algorithms to calculate primes). static void IsPrimeNet(int[] message)
{
    Parallel.ForEach(message, (number, state, index) =>
    {
        int upperlimit = (int)Math.Sqrt(number);
        for(int i=2;i<=upperlimit;i++)
        {
            if (message[index]%i == 0)  //no lock needed. every index is independent
            {
                message[index] = 0;
                break;
            }
        }
    });
} Now we take this code and translate it to OpenCL-C. The following Kernel is declared as a string in a file, inline or in a resource file. kernel void GetIfPrime(global int* message)
{
    int index = get_global_id(0);

    int upperl=(int)sqrt((float)message[index]);
    for(int i=2;i<=upperl;i++)
    {
        if(message[index]%i==0)
        {
            //printf("" %d / %d\n"",index,i );
            message[index]=0;
            return;
        }
    }
    //printf("" % d"",index);
} OpenCL does wrap your kernel (piece of code to run) in a loop. For simple 1D Arrays, you can get the index by calling get_global_id(0); The upper index of your index is passed when you invoke the kernel. For more information, check out this link. Instead of int[], you write int* and so on. You can also pass every other primitive type (int, float...). You have to pass arguments in the same order in which you declared them. You can also call printf inside your kernel to debug later. You can define as many methods as you like inside the kernel. You pick the entry point later by calling Invoke("Name Here"). OpenCL C is the same as C but you cannot use pointers and you also have some special data types. For in depth information, check out this link. Here is how you would use this project: Add the Nuget Package Cloo Add reference to OpenCLlib.dll. Download OpenCLLib.zip. Add using OpenCL static void Main(string[] args)
{

    int[] Primes = Enumerable.Range(2, 1000000).ToArray();
    EasyCL cl = new EasyCL();
    cl.Accelerator = Accelerator.Gpu;        //You can also set the accelerator after loading the kernel
    cl.LoadKernel(IsPrime);                  //Load kernel string here, (Compiles in the background)
    cl.Invoke("GetIfPrime", Primes.Length, Primes); //Call Function By Name With Parameters
    //Primes now contains all Prime Numbers
}

static string IsPrime
{
    get
    {
        return @"
        kernel void GetIfPrime(global int* message)
        {
            int index = get_global_id(0);

            int upperl=(int)sqrt((float)message[index]);
            for(int i=2;i<=upperl;i++)
            {
                if(message[index]%i==0)
                {
                    //printf("" %d / %d\n"",index,i );
                    message[index]=0;
                    return;
                }
            }
            //printf("" % d"",index);
        }";
    }
} With this, you can dynamically compile and invoke OpenCL kernels. You can also change your accelerator (CPU, GPU) after you have loaded the kernel. If you want to use every bit of computational power of your PC, you can use the class MultiCL. This class works by splitting your work into N parts. Every part is pushed onto the GPU or CPU whenever possible. This way, you get the maximum performance from your PC. You also know how much work is already done which is not possible with EasyCL. static void Main(string[] args)
{
    int[] Primes = Enumerable.Range(2, 1000000).ToArray();
    int N = 200;
    MultiCL cl = new MultiCL();
    cl.ProgressChangedEvent += Cl_ProgressChangedEvent1;
    cl.SetKernel(IsPrime, "GetIfPrime");
    cl.SetParameter(Primes);
    cl.Invoke(0, Primes.Length, N);
}

private static void Cl_ProgressChangedEvent1(object sender, double e)
{
    Console.WriteLine(e.ToString("0.00%"));
} How Does It Work? This work references the Nuget package Cloo. With Cloo, calls to OpenCL are possible from .NET. It basically hides all the implementation details you need to know to use OpenCL and Cloo. To get more information about your kernel or device, use the class OpenCL. There are 3 classes in this project: EasyCL (Call Kernels very easily) MultiCL (Call Kernels on GPU and CPU at the same time) OpenCL (Call Kernels and get some information about your device) Internally, every call to Invoke calls the corresponding methods in the OpenCL API: void Setargument(ComputeKernel kernel, int index, object arg)
{
    if (arg == null) throw new ArgumentException("Argument " + index + " is null");
    Type argtype = arg.GetType();

    if (argtype.IsArray)
    {
        Type elementtype = argtype.GetElementType();

        //ComputeBuffer<int> messageBuffer = new ComputeBuffer<int>(context,
        //ComputeMemoryFlags.ReadOnly | ComputeMemoryFlags.UseHostPointer, (int[])arg);

        ComputeMemory messageBuffer = (ComputeMemory)Activator.CreateInstance
                                      (typeof(ComputeBuffer<int>), new object[]
        {
            context,
            ComputeMemoryFlags.ReadWrite | ComputeMemoryFlags.UseHostPointer,
            arg
        });
        kernel.SetMemoryArgument(index, messageBuffer); // set the array
    }
    else
    {
        //kernel.SetValueArgument(index, (int)arg); // set the array size
        typeof(ComputeKernel).GetMethod("SetValueArgument").MakeGenericMethod(argtype).Invoke
                      (kernel, new object[] { index, arg });
    }
} Every time you change the kernel or the accelerator, the program gets recompiled: For a faster prototyping phase, this class also tells you why you cannot compile your kernel. public void LoadKernel(string Kernel)
{
    this.kernel = Kernel;
    program = new ComputeProgram(context, Kernel);

    try
    {
        program.Build(null, null, null, IntPtr.Zero);   //compile
    }
    catch (BuildProgramFailureComputeException)
    {
        string message = program.GetBuildLog(platform.Devices[0]);
        throw new ArgumentException(message);
    }
} It is very important to know that if your GPU driver crashes or kernels use 100% of your GPU for more than 3 seconds (on pre Win10 machines), the kernel will get aborted. You should dispose the EasyCL object after that. //If windows Vista,7,8,8.1 you better be ready to catch:

EasyCL cl = new EasyCL();
cl.InvokeAborted += (sender,e)=> Cl_InvokeAborted(cl,e);

private void Cl_InvokeAborted(EasyCL sender, string e)
{
     //your logic here
} For some reason, I don't know it is faster to invoke an empty kernel first and then all subsequent calls are faster. (OpenCL initialization maybe). What is Missing? In the current form, this class cannot use multiple GPUs. (If requested, I will implement it.) You cannot choose if you want to use the host pointer or read write access to int[] passed to the kernel. I did not see any performance gain by setting an array to read only. This class is written for PCs. With Visual Studio/Xamarin, it should be easy to adapt it for phones. (Modern Smartphones with 8 Cores do rival most Laptops in performance.) How Can I Help?

Infuehr 13-Aug-16 7:30  It really is very interesting that C# with float does perform 7x worse that OpenCL. Combined with the GPU you can get 10x the performance and C# is not that slow to begin with. I think the wrong performance before has to do with the kernel. Maybe the Compiler does something strange on OpenCL since the result of MAD_1024 is not used anywhere in the original project. Thx for sharing.

You will need to update the CreateContext functions which cause these exceptions: void CreateContext()
{
    if (_device == Accelerator.Gpu)
    {
        platform = ComputePlatform.Platforms[0];
        context = new ComputeContext((ComputeDeviceTypes)(_device), new ComputeContextPropertyList(platform), null, IntPtr.Zero);
    }
    else if (_device == Accelerator.Cpu)
    {
        platform = ComputePlatform.Platforms[1];
        context = new ComputeContext((ComputeDeviceTypes)(_device), new ComputeContextPropertyList(platform), null, IntPtr.Zero);
    }
    queue = new ComputeCommandQueue(context, context.Devices[0], ComputeCommandQueueFlags.None);
}
 Make sure your platforms indexes match with my indexes with debugger (check if your GPU is at index 0 and your CPU is at index 1, if not adjust indexes appropriately).

I couldn't find any in your profile. I'm looking for a freelance programmer on project basis in Austria. Maybe you are interested. Re: Private message D. Infuehr13-Aug-16 6:08 D. Infuehr 13-Aug-16 6:08  You can contact me at: daniel.infuehr@live.de Good work Ken Domino11-Aug-16 12:51 Ken Domino 11-Aug-16 12:51  Good work. (1) Although I've done the same, watch those hardwired values in your code, e.g., "// pick first platform ComputePlatform platform = ComputePlatform.Platforms[0];", or "string message = program.GetBuildLog(platform.Devices[0]);". (2) The C# Parallel.ForEach can be simplified, from data parallel into task parallel, boosting the performance of the step significantly, something like this: static void IsPrimeNet(int[] message)
{
    int size = message.Length;
    Parallel.For(0, size, (index) =
    {
        int number = index + 2;
        int upperlimit = (int)Math.Sqrt(number);
        for(int i=2; <= upperlimit; i++)
        {
            if (message[index]%i == 0)  //no lock needed. every index is independent
            {
                message[index] = 0;
                break;
            }
        }
    });
}
 (3) Instead of Cloo, I would recommend something like Cudafy for C#, which dynamically translates C# code into CUDA/C++ source, compiles, and then runs. I wrote a similar tool called Campy.Net, which uses a different API altogether, more like C++ AMP and C# lambdas but it's still a toy and I have not worked on it for a long time. Re: Good work D. Infuehr11-Aug-16 13:14 D. Infuehr 11-Aug-16 13:14  Thank you for your feedback. I used AMP quite a lot too. Since I wanted to use it in a higher level language i went with OpenCL. I am not sure if Cuda works on AMD too. I really wanted to see this work everywhere. Since you seem to know this stuff can you tell me why some other people get these exceptions? use of type 'double'requires cl_khr_fp64 extension to be enabled even though they are? Re: Good work Ken Domino12-Aug-16 10:57 Ken Domino 12-Aug-16 10:57  You are probably right, CUDA won't work on AMD GPUs--although there is some talk that it might someday (e.g., Nvidia's CUDA Language Can Now Run On AMD, Intel GPUs - TechFrag). In OpenCL 1.2, double is optional, so the cl_khr_fp64 is required--when using double. However, I'm not sure why the compiler is thinking the sqrt() call is double as you cast to float. Feels like a bug. It might be worthwhile for others to try compiling the kernel using clcc. For me, the kernel compiles fine for the Intel GPU as well as the NVIDIA GPU. However, if I change the code to use doubles, then it doesn't compile for the Intel GPU, but it does compile for the NVIDIA GPU. kernel void GetIfPrime(global int* message) 
{
    int index = get_global_id(0);
    int m = message[index];
    double t = m;
    double u = sqrt(t);
    int ul = (int)floor(u);
    int upperl = ul;
    for(int i=2;i<=upperl;i++)
    {
        if(message[index]%i==0)
        {
            message[index]=0;
            return;
        }
    }
} Re: Good work D. Infuehr13-Aug-16 6:11 D. Infuehr 13-Aug-16 6:11  Turns out you need to have Intel Xeon (or whatever) OpenCL runtime installed to use OpenCL on Intel. Thank you for your feedback.

Huang August 10th, 2016 @gthuang @xconomy Like Us Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter LinkedIn Email Reprints They are the few, the proud, the tech companies that have gone public this year. Acacia Communications is one of them. The Maynard, MA-based networking company (NASDAQ: ACIA) raised $103.5 million in its IPO in May. That remains the Boston area’s only tech IPO of 2016. Meanwhile, San Francisco-based software firm Twilio went public in June, raising $150 million. And Redwood City, CA-based Talend, a data-integration software company, had a $95 million IPO last month, as did Seattle-based Impinj, a radio-frequency identification tech company, which raised $67 million. Acacia’s first quarterly report as a public company is expected Thursday. So it seems natural to ask whether the firm has much in common with other recent-IPO companies. “We are a different kind of animal,” says Murugesan Shanmugaraj, Acacia’s president and CEO. “We are more like Intel.” He’s talking about the fact that Acacia delivers hardware—specifically, optical networking modules that help wireless carriers and cloud infrastructure providers run data communications over long distances and between data centers. (The comparison also has to do with delivering silicon-based products, but we’ll get to that in a minute.) Acacia is also different from most newly public tech firms in that it has been profitable for the last two years (what a concept). The company reported profits of $13.5 million and $40.5 million in 2014 and 2015, respectively, on revenues of $146.2 million and $239 million. Acacia’s stock is currently trading at around $69 a share, which is triple its IPO price of $23. The company had 228 employees as of the end of the first quarter. Shanmugaraj In a recent interview, Shanmugaraj couldn’t comment on Acacia’s latest financial performance, citing the company’s SEC-mandated quiet period, but he shed light on some lessons learned from 30 years in the telecom industry, as well as his company’s strategy in optical communications—and why it’s important to the broader tech world. Acacia was founded in 2009 by Benny Mikkelsen, Christian Rasmussen, and Mehrdad Givehchi. The trio of engineers collectively had experience from Bell Labs (previously owned by Alcatel-Lucent), Mintera, and Sycamore Networks. Shanmugaraj joined Acacia in early 2010. He says he first met the founders over an espresso at the firm’s offices, in a building once occupied by Digital Equipment Corporation. Shanmugaraj, who goes by “Raj,” provided a business spark. He was coming from Alcatel-Lucent, where he had been vice president of business development in the optical networking division. Before that, he was CEO of Astral Point Communications, which was bought by Alcatel in 2002. Shanmugaraj bonded with the Acacia founders over their experiences in telecom—and their vision for the new company. Acacia saw an opportunity to “siliconize” optical communication systems—meaning bring the benefits of the silicon chips at the heart of computers and electronic devices to the field of photonics. The idea was to make optical interconnect equipment (such as line cards and circuit boards) faster, smaller, more energy-efficient, and easier to build. The applications could be in everything from big telecom providers’ networks—think Verizon and AT&T—to Web infrastructure companies like Amazon and Google and their ever-growing data centers. Silicon photonics has been a hot research area since the early 2000s. But it took many years for technical hurdles to be cleared and for the commercial market to develop. “Optical networking is a difficult space. It’s quite lumpy and there are lots of big players, but we did a lot of right things,” Shanmugaraj says. “We built credibility right away. That’s hard to build, and easy to destroy.” Still, he says, “we knew this was going to be a bit of a slog.” Shanmugaraj and his team had lived through the telecom crash of 2001-2002. “We saw the goods and the bads,” he says. “We learned … Next Page » Single PageCurrently on Page: 1 2 Gregory T.

Posted on August 10, 2016 By Drew Robb Tweet When it comes to enterprise SSD, there's nothing simple. Oh, for simpler times. When enterprise flash started to gain ground in the storage world around seven years ago, the available format was the solid state drive (SSD). It was neatly manufactured to fit into the disk slot of a storage array. But since those blissful bucolic beginnings, complexity has reigned. As well as SSDs, we now have so many labels for flash-based storage. This includes PCIe-based flash, custom flash modules (CFM), NVMe-based SSDs, server-based flash, storage-attached flash, network-attached flash, memory channel-attached flash, SAS SSDs¸ SATA SSDs, Fibre Channel (FC) SSDs, and even Data Center SSDs – and then there are all flash arrays (AFA) and hybrid flash arrays (HFA). And of course there are the many types of flash itself to further complicate matters. “Flash is permeating the enterprise through several different deployment architectures that include both server- and network-based approaches,” said IDC analyst Eric Burgener. “Flash deployments at scale will allow enterprises to reap not only performance benefits of flash but secondary economic benefits such as fewer devices to meet storage performance requirements, reduced energy and floor space consumption, fewer servers needed to drive storage performance and lower software licensing costs.” Each analyst and company, however, seems to define things slightly differently or favor one form factor over another. So what is the best enterprise SSD format? Greg Schulz, an analyst with StorageIO Group, explained that part of the confusion may be due to a subtle shift in the definition of SSD from solid state drive to solid state device, in some cases. Some people hold firmly to the drive definition, while others favor the looser device concept. Sticking with SSDs as solid state drives for now, the plus of that architecture is that it fits snuggly into time-honored storage array designs, and can take advantage of existing controller architectures. This simplifies the design and manufacturing process. However, this approach can bottleneck the performance potential of flash. The other main approach is to bring the flash closer to the compute as in CFMs, though there are several ways to do this as covered in the complex terminology outlined above. The CFM typically has its own controllers and is built on some kind of card to slot into a motherboard, for example. The goals are to maximum the performance and eliminate the bottlenecks that may exist in other enterprise SSD designs. “Location matters, so you want to get as many solid state resources as close to your applications as possible,” said Schulz. “But to keep it cost effective, you may need to leverage SATA, and SAS SSD drives to satisfy your need for capacity.” Market Leadership and Innovation The many labels in circulation can make it difficult to determine who is the market leader in SSD. Jim Handy, General Director at Objective Analysis, outlined which vendors he reckoned were the leaders in some of the major categories. He said Western Digital’s HGST leads SAS SSD unit shipments, and probably also PCIe SSD (courtesy of its acquisition of SanDisk, FusionIO and Virident). Intel, though, is out on front on Data Center SSDs, though there definition is a little vague. While these leadership positions relate to the mainstream enterprise SSD marketplace, even this breakdown is being upended by rapid change and technological innovation. “There are a few budget providers who supply the bulk of the SSDs used in hyperscale applications, since hyperscale companies tend to be fixated on cost,” said Handy. He added that the market used to be broken down into two camps: PCIe and SAS for high speed at a high price, and SATA for better economy at a slower speed. Today PCIe flash is still more expensive than SATA, but this will be changing soon with the ramp of PCIe m.2 SSDs.  When it does, the rationale to use SATA will weaken, and over time PCIe will become the dominant interface for flash in computing, Handy said. Keeping with Tradition That said, innovation is also enhancing the performance of traditional SSD-based architectures. “The computing community is coming to the realization that a Hard Disk Drive (HDD) interface and an HDD software I/O stack is not a good way to manage flash, since it slows down flash’s performance,” said Handy.  “NVMe has been devised to handle the interface, and various software products and standards help to move past the bottlenecks in the software stack.” EMC, for one, uses standard form factor 2.5" SAS SSDs for its XtremIO flash platform.  “We do not have plans to pursue custom form factors in the future as we do not see an inherent advantage in them and prefer to benefit from a wide supplier base (similar to why EMC did not vertically integrate and make its own HDDs),”said Tamir Segal, Senior Manager, Product Marketing Core Technology Division of EMC. “The SSD form factor also has advantages in hot-swap serviceability and the ability to leverage common drive shelf hardware with other EMC products.” But EMC isn’t putting all of its eggs in one SSD basket. Other EMC products such as VMAX All Flash and Unity utilize different forms of SSD’s, but all are based on commodity SSD technologies available from the big manufacturers in this market. So what about PCIe? “PCI-E based flash will probably remain a niche product for caching purposes only,” said Segal. “But it’s the software that truly adds value.” Most vendors, in fact, tout the advantages of their own particular software architecture as the best enterprise SSD approach. Chris Tsilipounidakis, Manager of Product Marketing at Tegile, said his company combines a hardware and software design that optimizes highly randomized workloads by isolating metadata and logs into their own containers. Its metadata acceleration technique isolates and aggregates metadata away from user and application data onto dedicated logical flash devices with optimized I/O paths. This boosts performance as I/O is no longer gated by interspersing data with metadata. This also provides inline deduplication without a performance impact as the dedupe table also resides on dedicated logical flash devices. No Flash in the Pan Just about every vendor makes a convincing pitch for its particular flash architecture. But whatever the SSD format, the best advice is to test any flash storage product in your own environment to see how it does with your own applications and workloads. As for the debate over where exactly to put flash, Handy sees SSDs as belonging in the server, inside the storage array and being used in various configurations and form factors for some time to come. “Users are getting more savvy and are looking to put inexpensive SSDs into most of their systems as a way to reduce the need to go with more costly options: sharing a database across a number of servers, increasing the DRAM memory to the most a server can handle, or buying a new SAN,” said Handy. That’s why he brings attention to the fact that the largest growth market for SSDs is applications that don’t yet use them. While it may appear that everyone has turned to flash, the reality is that it is far from the case. Certainly, the market is booming, but there is plenty of room for growth. IDC estimates enterprise all solid state spending will exceed $1.6 billion this year, up from $0.3 billion in 2012. With the price coming down by more than fivefold in the last four years, IDC expects SSD growth to continue to grow steeply in all its many configurations, form factors and architectures. Indeed, there are many new areas of potential deployment still to open up. “To date, flash has not been used in secondary storage environments like backup, archiving, DR and content repositories – outside of limited use to cache metadata and indexes,” said Burgener.
