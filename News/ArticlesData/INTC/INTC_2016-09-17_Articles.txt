AMD's Mark Papermaster has had an interesting past. Before becoming AMD's CTO and SVP, he spent 26 years at IBM, working his way into its Integration & Values Team and Technical Leadership Team – two exclusive and highly confidential workforces. Following his tenure at IBM, he went on to join Apple, Cisco Systems, before taking up position at AMD. Papermaster is a man armed with a wealth of knowledge and so, when he says that AMD is on its way back into the big leagues, ready to go toe-to-toe with Intel and Nvidia once again, you sit up and listen. Papermaster is also the first to admit that AMD fell behind. In server-grade architecture Intel owns practically 99% of the market; Intel dominates in the high-performance CPU space; and Nvidia is absolutely killing it in the high-end graphics department. But AMD hasn't been sitting on its laurels for the past few years, it's been actively working towards coming back bigger than ever, and it's within the next year that AMD will see the investment really begin to pay off. “As you know, semiconductors aren't like software, where you can say you're shifting focus and within the year have a new software product out,” Papermaster explains to me as we meet to discuss the future of AMD. “We shifted our focus years ago, and it takes that long [to make a change]. The products we're rolling out now are high-performance products – it's a return to our roots and we're very focused.” "It's a return to our roots and we're very focused." But what, exactly, is the company focused upon? Well, according to Papermaster, AMD used to be 90% dependent on the PC business – today, more than half of its revenue comes from the semi-custom business. Games consoles form a large part of this, and that's why the three key areas of AMD's comeback strategy focus around games, “immersive platforms” and, erm, data centres. Clearly, of the three areas that form AMD's focus, the data centre is the least sexy area, but it's the one with the largest potential for change. Intel – AMD's biggest rival – holds 99% of this market, having stolen back most of the 30% share AMD once enjoyed back in its heyday. Seeing as AMD predicts that the data centre space will be worth $18bn by 2019, grabbing back that 30% or more is sure to be lucrative for AMD's growth. In the games space, however, AMD is already absolutely crushing it. As an industry, games is worth more than $15 billion a year – and will only continue to grow. For now, AMD dominates the home-console market, supplying chips for the Xbox One, PS4 and Wii U – with the Xbox Project Scorpio and PS4 Pro also set to use AMD chips. In the PC space, however, it needs to fight back against the ever-growing force that is Nvidia and it's high-end graphics cards. It is in “immersive platforms” that AMD is ready to take its biggest leap, though. Papermaster sees the growth of VR, AR and Mixed Reality as a key space for AMD and its future. “We've gone from radio to TV; sound to audio-visual to interactive. But each one of these progressions engages you further… immersive computing is clearly the next way we'll interface with computing. It isn't just about seeing and hearing; it will involve all of your senses because you're truly surrounded by audio, visual and – eventually – haptics. “We've had the technology to create VR for years, but now it's affordable. The breakthrough this year is not only the development of head-mounted displays, but the development of CPUs and graphics that can drive them. Several years ago, we made a decision to invest in high-end graphics and high-end computing, and we've come out with a set of products ready to create a great VR experience.” It's these products that form the lynchpin of AMD's revival plan. Its upcoming Zen CPU is slated to be the first high-performance chip from AMD that can compete on a par with Intel's own architecture – benching the same, if not better than Intel's Broadwell E Core i7. Zen also offers 40% better performance than it's Excavator chipset using the same amount of energy. AMD's Radeon range also brings VR-ready graphics cards to the market, with the RX 480 – which sits between Nvidia's 1060 and 1070 cards – capable of pushing out power at a much more affordable price point. Suddenly, with these products, AMD is back in the running. Video of Breakthrough Performance of Next-Generation &ldquo;Zen&rdquo; “There's pent-up demand for competition.” Being a competitor is exactly what AMD wants to be within these spaces. “There's pent-up demand for competition,” explains Papermaster. “High-performance desktop and server [are areas that both] have a clear lack of competition. Both are dominated by our competitor and hungry for a competitive product – which is exactly what Zen will bring. “We've committed to a very strong roadmap, and my commitment is absolutely competitive, generational improvements. When our customers come back to us once we've released Zen and see we're back in the thick of the competition, making use of leapfrogging design teams, we'll absolutely maintain a competitive pace in the industry.”   Now, after years of slumber, it looks as if AMD is finally back in with the big industry players. Papermaster sums up how AMD made such huge progressions by stating that because “AMD is a fraction of the size of Intel, it causes us to be extremely innovative in how we create products.” But AMD isn't done here. We already know that it plans to maintain pace with the rest of the industry, but if it wants to hit the lofty heights of high-end immersive computing, it needs to do more. Thankfully, it sounds as if the company is up to the challenge: “if you want to go from what we have today to true presence, [there are] orders of magnitude more progression that we need to do. “That is, however, our passion; it's what AMD engineers live to do.” This article originally appeared at alphr.com Related Articles Both Nvidia and AMD release hot fix drivers New AMD Radeon Software Crimson drivers out now AMD unveils Radeon Solid State Graphics tech for workstation GPUs Gigabyte releases G1 Gaming RX 480 video card AMD's RX 480 claims the DirectX 12 crown in new Futuremark benchmark Source: Copyright © Alphr, Dennis Publishing See more about:  amd   Tweet Email this Print this Feedback   Readers of this article also read...   What does a Trump win mean for tech and science?     Gallery: The PCs of PAX Australia 2016     Samsung: When the giant trips     How WD is making storage sexy again     With Pixel, Google is barrelling headfirst into Apple’s backyard   More in Atomic (1 of 10 articles) NEWS Roccat releases Cross cross-platform gaming headphones << Prev Next >> View all Atomic articles >> More in Atomic (2 of 10 articles) NEWS Both Nvidia and AMD release hot fix drivers << Prev Next >> View all Atomic articles >> More in Atomic (3 of 10 articles) NEWS Group on trial for cyber-theft of $15M in FIFA Coins << Prev Next >> View all Atomic articles >> More in Atomic (4 of 10 articles) NEWS Might want to hold off on those 375.86 Nvidia drivers << Prev Next >> View all Atomic articles >> More in Atomic (5 of 10 articles) NEWS New GeForce 375.86 WHQL drivers out now << Prev Next >> View all Atomic articles >> More in Atomic (6 of 10 articles) REVIEW Review: G.Skill Ripjaws MX780 impresses first time << Prev Next >> View all Atomic articles >> More in Atomic (7 of 10 articles) FEATURE The SLI question: Is multi-GPU worth it? << Prev Next >> View all Atomic articles >> More in Atomic (8 of 10 articles) REVIEW Review: Fractal Design Define C is a great mix of silence and features << Prev Next >> View all Atomic articles >> More in Atomic (9 of 10 articles) GALLERY Gallery: The PCs of PAX Australia 2016 << Prev Next >> View all Atomic articles >> More in Atomic (10 of 10 articles) NEWS The beautiful PC mods of PAX Australia 2016! << Prev Next >> View all Atomic articles >> Most Read Most Discussed Powered by Disqus Latest Comments Powered by Disqus Latest in Atomic News Roccat releases Cross cross-platform gaming headphones Review Review: G.Skill Ripjaws MX780 impresses first time Feature The SLI question: Is multi-GPU worth it?

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Sep 18, 2016 at 2:00PM Image source: Intel.  Earlier this year, chip giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) disclosed to investors that it had axed its "tick-tock" product development methodology in favor of a new one known as "process-architecture-optimization". Until Intel formally unveiled its seventh-generation Core processor family -- the first "optimization" that Intel is bringing to market -- it wasn't clear what this development methodology really entailed. However, the details behind this strategy are now much more apparent. Although it's a reasonable change, I believe that Intel would be best-served with additional investments to make it even better. Allow me to explain. Understanding the current strategy Under Intel's process-architecture-optimization development methodology, here's what the company is expected to deliver with each step: Process: This is a direct replacement for the "tick" under Intel's previous methodology. What Intel delivers here is a slightly enhanced processor core, as well as a new graphics processor manufactured on a significantly denser manufacturing technology than the product that came before it. Architecture: And this is a replacement for the "tock". In this step, Intel launches a "new" processor core with substantial performance and feature enhancements over the prior-generation. Intel is also expected to deliver a new graphics processor architecture in this step, along with other significant platform feature enhancements. It is likely that, going forward, Intel will build this chip on a performance-enhanced version of the manufacturing technology that made its debut in the "process" step. Optimization: Based on what Intel delivered with its seventh-generation Core processor family, it would appear that here, Intel takes essentially the same architecture that came in the previous step and implements it on a performance-enhanced version of the manufacturing technology that was used in the "architecture" stage. With this methodology, Intel can deliver new and better products each year, so in that respect, it is a clear win. However, there is room for Intel to enjoy further improvements -- if it's willing to make the required investments. Optimization could enjoy architectural benefits During the optimization stage, Intel's products see performance benefits associated with the new manufacturing technologies. In effect, the company can run these chips at higher speeds while keeping power consumption the same. But it might make sense for Intel to try to be more aggressive on the architectural side of things here, too. Remember that under "tick-tock", Intel's architecture teams planned for all-new CPU architectures every two years and new graphics architectures every three years. Indeed, it's not as though the "tick-tock" methodology was derailed by execution problems on the part of the architecture teams. Indeed, the problems are clearly related to the inability of Intel's manufacturing group to make generational manufacturing technology leaps at the same speed they used to be able to. So, going forward, Intel would probably be better served by adopting the following methodology: Step 1: Move to an all-new manufacturing technology, tweak the CPU cores a bit, and introduce a new graphics processor. This would be analogous to a traditional "tick" under the prior methodology (in other words, think Intel's third generation Core processors and its fifth generation Core processors).  Step 2: Move to a performance-enhanced version of the manufacturing technology in step 1 but also deliver significant generational leaps in both CPU, graphics, and platform architecture more than is typically expected. This would basically be the same as a "tock" under Intel's previous methodology (think fourth generation Core and sixth generation Core processors) but with the added boost from a performance-enhanced version of the manufacturing technology. Step 3: Move to an even higher-performance variant of the manufacturing technologies in step 1 and step 2, tweak the processor cores a bit, and introduce a new graphics architecture. This would also be like a "tick" under Intel's previous development methodology, but the main difference would be that the manufacturing technology delivers better performance (which is all the end customer really cares about) but doesn't deliver the cost reduction that comes with a smaller manufacturing technology.  Under such a methodology, Intel's core intellectual property teams don't have to change the pace at which they introduce new technologies, but the performance enhancements that the chipmaker will be able to deliver with each generation, and cumulatively over a three-year/generation period, would be much better. This would ultimately mean better products and stronger competitive positioning for the chip giant in the years ahead. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool recommends Intel.

Apple’s iPhone 7 does not bring any significant improvement in terms of design but it packs the best possible hardware specifications. It is needless to say that both iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are the most powerful smartphones in their categories. At its special event in San Francisco, Apple executive Phil Schiller dived deep into the hardware prowess of latest iPhones but left specifics for iFixit and Chipworks to reveal. Apple iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus ditched the 3.5mm headphone jack but also made way for Intel chips. No, Apple iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus don’t have Intel processors, rather the chipmaker is helping with the phone part of the device. Apple iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus compromises of four Intel components — two RF transceivers, the baseband modem and power management IC. Apple iPhone 7 model used by Chipworks for teardown reveals Intel’s XMM7360 modem as the baseband processor. The baseband processor is responsible for LTE advanced smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices. Apple is also using two Intel PMB5750 as the default multimode RF transceiver. According to Techinsights, the RF transceivers are designed on TSMC’s 28nm process. This is Intel’s big big win with the iPhone 7. The company has also supplied its power management IC codenamed PMB6826. Earlier, iPhone 7 Plus teardown by iFixit revealed what has actually replaced the headphone jack. According to iFixit, a large portion of the area utilised by headphone is now being used to incorporate a bigger battery and the new taptic engine. Apple’s new taptic engine inside iPhone 7 Plus is considerably bigger and paves way for iPhone without home button.

Over a cheap bottle of chardonnay one dark night in Cupertino, Intel wooed Apple with flimsy promises. The pair felt a connection (around the 1.9GHz mark) after the iPhone maker opened up about its long-distance relationship with San Diego's Qualcomm. "I don't want to get too tied down," Apple sighed. "I'm not ready for the commitment." "Baby, I'm here for you," said Intel. "But you don't know anything about mobile." "I've changed, baby, I've changed." Apple's heart melted like a Galaxy Note 7 in a child's hand. Now, thought Intel, if only it could scheme its way further into the MacBook maker's life to wreck any plans to move from x86 to ARM. I just can't understand why my screenwriting career hasn't taken off. A peek inside the iPhone 7 has confirmed that Apple is using a mix of Intel and Qualcomm radio modems in the new handsets. Typically, Qualcomm provides these communications chips, which are used to connect the device wirelessly to the cellular network for calls, texts and mobile internet. Apple hates being tied down to a single component source, so it decided to give Intel a shot. There's also the interesting dynamic of Qualcomm providing Snapdragon system-on-chips and modems to Apple's arch-rival Samsung. Couple that with Intel's desire to get its radio modem business a slice of the massive mobile world – while Intel's traditional PC world diminishes – and that Apple relies on Intel x86 processors for its desktop and laptop products, you can see why Apple let Intel in through the backdoor to its iPhone production. We all knew it was coming. In a conference call with investment analysts in April, Qualcomm CEO Steven Mollenkopf said he was "assuming" that a major customer – cough, cough, Apple – would use a second supplier. And in July, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said he was "concerned about getting the leading-edge momentum going for us with the 7360" – that's the XMM 7360 modem that launched in 2015. And true enough, the XMM 7360 has turned up in some iPhone 7 and 7 Plus handsets. There's a catch: this chip doesn't support CDMA networks. So if you buy an Intel-modem phone, and you want to switch to a CDMA network, such as Sprint or Verizon in the US, you'll be out of luck. Qualcomm's X12 radio modems support CDMA so iPhones using those chips will work universally. Luckily, there's a handy guide on Apple's website listing the two variants of the iPhone 7/7 Plus. The A1660/A1661 works with GSM and CDMA networks, sports a Qualcomm MDM9645M X12 modem chipset, and works with Verizon and Sprint in the US. The A1778/A1784 supports GSM, sports an Intel modem chipset, and works with AT&T and T-Mobile US in America. What the Apple website doesn't mention is that if you carrier unlock an A1660/A1661, you'll be able to use it on AT&T and T-Mobile US because the Qualcomm modem inside will support those networks. But if you carrier unlock an A1778/A1784, you won't be able to use it on CDMA networks. Basically, if you want a phone that works everywhere, get the A1660/A1661. If in doubt, check the model number against the aforementioned webpage for carrier compatibility. For what it's worth, in the UK, Apple will sell you an A1778/A1784 that supports 3, EE, O2 and Vodafone. Intel isn't insane for leaving out CDMA support, by the way: the standard is dying, and Qualcomm owns a load of CDMA patents, so Chipzilla decided to skip it. To further complicate things, potentially, Apple can switch out Intel's XMM 7360 in its GSM-only A1778/A1784 for the tried-and-tested Qualcomm X12 but use firmware to limit the phone to non-CDMA networks. This could happen if something goes wrong with the Intel supply – such as if the XMM 7360 isn't up to the X12's performance. One final thought: the new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus won't support the expensive AWS-3 radio bands, aka LTE band 66, which were cleared to make way for greater mobile broadband coverage in the US.

Housing was raised and on this issue they spoke of "competitiveness and potential impact to employees". They also touched on issues such as Brexit, employment and tax. A spokeswoman for Intel said the company continually "engages on topics of competitive significance, including housing for employees". Intel employs around 4,500 people in Leixlip, Co Kildare. Sinnott also attended a meeting in the Department of Jobs where the deployment of broadband was raised. Last week, Susan Dargan of State Street, the international financial services company which employs 2,500 people here, said that accommodation could become an issue if firms in the sector decided to locate to Ireland following the Brexit vote. She suggested that Dublin city planners would have to consider raising height restrictions on buildings. Earlier this year Cathy Kearney, head of Apple's European operations, met with Cork city council and said that plans to expand its European headquarters could be hindered by the lack of housing available for staff. Apple is set to create 1,000 new jobs in Cork, bringing the workforce there to 6,000.

Toggle Navigation A-   A+ Sign in News   Stock Home «Back Need to promote natural gas-based fuel cell technology: Pradhan IANS | Bengaluru Sep 17, 2016 06:50 PM IST More than half the power requirement here of IT multinational Intel's Indian subsidiary is produced from fuel cells using natural gas, Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on Friday. "Out of Intel's power requirement of 4MW, 2.5MW is produced using fuel cell based technology using Natural Gas developed by Bloom Energy," Pradhan tweeted following a visit to the Intel R&D centre here. "Visited Intel R&D centre in Bengaluru. The $12 Billion facility is one of the three such facilities in the world," he said. Last month, state-run gas utility GAIL (India) and US-based Bloom Energy signed an agreement to deploy revolutionary natural gas-based fuel cell technology to generate electricity. Gas is already being supplied by GAIL for energising a multi-megawatt Bloom Energy project at the Technology Park here. The technology is currently being used by over 100 of the Fortune 500 companies that are diversified majors in IT, Telecom, retailing, e-commerce and consumer goods. Bloom Energy's solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) technology converts fuel into electricity using natural gas as the base fuel in a highly efficient non-combustible process that reduces emissions of greenhouse gas and harmful air pollutants, and with minimal use of water. "GAIL is supplying PNG for this to Bloom under an MoU. This Green Energy with no noise & minimal water intake can replace diesel based gensets," Pradhan said in a separate tweet. The minimal use of water is a major consideration here in India's major IT hub, which has witnessed violent street protests this week provoked by the court-mandated release of Cauvery water to neighbouring Tamil Nadu. "Fuel cells can use biogas generated from biomass in rural areas & from municipal wastes in the cities to generate cost-effective green energy," he said "There is a need for promoting this technology. With scale the cost of this will become affordable for common & domestic consumers as well," Pradhan added in another tweet. He also visited the LPG Equipment Research Centre (LERC) here that specialises in testing various liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) equipment. "Asked LERC to think out of box; put consumer convenience on top priority & adopt suggestions given by industry experts & innovators," he tweeted after the LERC visit. "Startups have a great role to play with innovations in making LPG more environment friendly by enhancing efficiency & reducing emissions," he said in another tweet. --IANS bc/ask/bg Advertisement << Previous Article   «Back Ad Ad Most Read Demonetisation: Get Rs 2,000 cash at petrol pumps from Nov 18 ATMs in small cities, villages will take weeks to be ready Modus Operandi: How black money hoarders are trying to escape I-T lens Tata Trusts get I-T notice for tax avoidance Ratan Tata should step down for crisis to abate: 6 suggestions from NYU's Damodaran More From Current Affairs Indians win most international scholarships for rice, wheat research Demonetisation main issue in Bengal by-polls India will move forward with implementation of Paris agreement: Indian Environment Minister Demonetisation a game changer: Ravi Shankar Prasad India, Cyprus ink new Double Tax Avoidance Agreement [ more ] Top Stories Supreme Court refuses to accept rejection of Collegium recommendations T N Ninan: Our post-truths Shekhar Gupta: The WhatsApp governance Demonetisation: FM says execution could not have been better Cash crunch chokes off India palm oil imports [ more ] Markets Cash crunch chokes off India palm oil imports MCX to levy concentration margin from December Gold quotes at huge discount, price hits 4-month low Sovereign gold bonds worth 14 tonnes in six tranches Diamond exporters eye 8-10% rise in exports in coming quarter [ more ] Companies Acting out innovation Koovs raises $16 million from Times Group, other investors Vikram Johri: Lessons from a scandal Bajaj commences production of 400-cc bike from Chakan plant Natco plans to double drug filings next year [ more ] Opinion Sunil Sethi: My little black diary T N Ninan: Our post-truths Shekhar Gupta: The WhatsApp governance Why Gruh Finance isn't a top pick among analysts anymore?

The chipmaker now expects third-quarter revenue to check in around $15.6 billion, give or take $300 million. That’s up from its earlier forecast of $14.9 billion (give or take $500 million) which was roughly what analysts were expecting. Share value in Intel is up 2.64 percent to $37.52 as of writing on the revised guidance. According to Reuters, the updated estimate – if it pans out – would be the highest-ever quarterly revenue for Intel which is a bit ironic considering the stale state of the PC industry as of late. It’s been a tumultuous time for traditional PC vendors and suppliers for the better part of the past decade as consumers shift their computing habits from desktops and notebooks to smartphones and tablets. Intel had an early opportunity to supply the processor in the first iPhone but executives declined because the two sides couldn’t agree to financial terms. In hindsight, that proved to be a major misstep, one that Intel has tried to rectify for years with little success. Intel has reportedly rekindled a relationship with Apple although not as a CPU supplier. PC sales are likely on the rise now that Microsoft is no longer offering its free Windows 10 upgrade. Rather than sticking with an outdated machine running an old operating system, some are no doubt opting to buy a new PC.

Reuters/Brendan McDermid The Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will reportedly cost $100 more than its predecessor Surface Pro 4. Microsoft has not revealed anything about its upcoming, widely-anticipated device. It may or may not reveal something in the upcoming October event. The tech giant will be hosting a Windows 10 Devices event in October. As per The Bitbag, the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will cost a $100 more as it will be including the Intel Kaby Lake processor. The device will also run on the upgraded Windows 10 OS. The company has a lot of features planned for the device. The Intel processors will boost battery life, a requirement that every Surface fan is craving for. The Intel Kaby Lake processor brings native USB support whereas the Skylake ones need third-party hardware for USB support. The new processors are expected to make the size of Surface Pro 5 handier. The processors will also enable 4K tech and support a 3,840×2,160 pixels UHD display. Nothing is official at this point though Microsoft launched the Surface Pro 4 device in October 2015. The company is holding the Windows 10 event in October this year too. This has made tech enthusiasts and fans excited because of the possibility of a Surface Pro 5 and Surface Phone 2016 announcement. However, it is unlikely that the device will be launched in October. There are several hints that Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will be launched only in 2017 and not this year. Even though Intel has released low power Y and U Kaby Lake processors, Microsoft wants to include the most powerful processor form Intel and for that it will have to wait till end of this year. Microsoft is also working on the Windows 10 update, Redstone 2, which is expected to be ready by spring of 2017. It is unlikely that Microsoft will release the Surface Pro 5 without the Redstone 2 update. This again points at a 2017 release. There are reports that Microsft, during the October event, will simply refresh the Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book, replacing the processors and implementing minor upgrades.

By Sean Portnoy | September 17, 2016 -- 00:58 GMT (17:58 PDT) | Topic: Mobility HP ProBook 400 business laptop HP's revamp of its ProBook line of business laptops isn't as sexy as some of its recent notebook announcements, but it's certainly trying its best to make us think so. The company's blog post announcing the new models mentions millennials twice in an effort to show it's listening to the youngest workers out there and what they think about business portables. What's Hot on ZDNet When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office? GE Digital builds up its global presence with acquisitions, partnerships ​Domino's claims world-first pizza drone delivery Microsoft delivers test builds of Visual Studio for Mac, Visual Studio 2017 for Windows And what do millennials want? Why a more stylish laptop, of course. (Because Gen Xers and Baby Boomers love heavy, boxy notebooks and wouldn't also prefer not having to schlepp extra heft around.) Luckily, young and old alike can enjoy the slimmer ProBook 400 models (as little as 3.3 pounds for the ProBook 430 G4) -- five new ones in total -- which include a new "Asteroid Silver" chassis color and reflective HP logo to give them a slightly more contemporary look. More important to the business buyers and IT staff is the durability HP bakes into the new ProBooks. The company says the laptops have passed MIL-STD 810G standard tests for resistance to drops and shocks, dust, and extreme temperature, and that it has tested their reliabilitiy for 120,000 hours. Virtual security is provided by Trusted Platform Module 2.0 hardware and HP's self-healing BIOSphere protection. The new ProBooks also enjoy the latest processors from both AMD and Intel. The ProBook 455 G4 features AMD's seventh-generation A series processors, while the other models use Intel's seventh-generation "Kaby Lake" Core CPUs. Each version can be configured in a number of ways, with a maximum of 16GB of RAM and choice of various hard drives or SSDs for storage. Select models can come with Nvidia's GeForce 930MX mobile graphics, and all feature USB-C ports and run Windows 10 Pro. With a 13.3-inch display, the ProBook 430 G4 is the smallest of the new models, with the 14-inch 440 close behind. The 450 joins the 455 as 15.6-inch editions, while the 17.3-inch 470 being the largest new ProBook, though still weighing in under 6 pounds. It's also the only new laptop with a standard screen resolution of 1,600x900, with the others sporting 1,366x768 screens. All models can be upgraded to full HD displays or touchscreens. Those options and the choice of beefier components will quickly increase the reasonable starting prices for the new ProBooks. Owing no doubt to the AMD processor inside, the 455 is the cheapest at $499, with the 440's starting price $30 more. The 430 and 450 base configurations begin at $599, while the desktop replacement-sized 470 is priciest with a $749 starting cost. HP says the new ProBooks are already on sale, but only the 440 G4 is available to purchase on the HP site at the time of this writing and in a much pricier configuration than the base model's price suggests.

Close share panel Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Many of the UK's most promising tech firms have been bought by bigger, overseas firms When it comes to tech, there is no lack of ideas or talent in the UK. But there is, nonetheless, an ever-growing list of promising companies that sell out or simply fail, rather than growing into British titans that could rival the likes of Microsoft, Apple, Google, IBM, Intel, Oracle and Facebook. Below are some notable examples: Sinclair Research Image caption Sinclair Research sold more than 5 million ZX Spectrums over eight years There was a time in the 1980s when video gamers and teenage coders across the UK were more likely to be hunched over one of Sir Clive Sinclair's computers than an American or Asian-made alternative. Sinclair Research may have only made its ZX Spectrums for domestic sale, but it licensed Timex to make clones that were sold elsewhere in Europe, the US and South America. Dozens of unofficial versions were a hit in the Soviet Union too, proving their appeal, if not a source of income. But the firm got unstuck when it tried to enter the business market. Its Sinclair QL was designed to outperform IBM's PCs, but its tape-based Microdrive storage was unreliable and the British company did not offer the kind of telephone support the corporate sector required. Media captionWATCH: Sir Clive Sinclair discusses his role in computing's past and future "Their computer designs were abominable by our standards," Sir Clive later told the BBC. "But because... IBM had such a powerful position, I don't think we could have challenged it." After the C5 electric vehicle also failed to catch on, a cash-strapped Sir Clive sold his firm's brand and assets in 1986 to Amstrad, another domestic computer-maker. Image copyright PA Image caption Sir Clive sold the rights to his computers to Alan Sugar's Amstrad Amstrad later faced troubles with computer storage of its own and eventually switched focus to TV set-top boxes before selling out to BSkyB. Friends Reunited Image copyright Friends Reunited Image caption Friends Reunited led to marriages - and divorces Years before Facebook was founded, let alone open to the public, a couple from Hertfordshire and one of their friends, created a social network that attracted millions of users in the UK, Australia, South Africa and beyond. Friends Reunited connected members with their former classmates by getting them to share the names of their old schools and the year they had left. Over time, the theme was expanded to cover places of work, sports teams and neighbourhoods where users had lived. Spin-off sites were also created to offer online dating, job searches, message boards and ways for users to trace their family trees. When ITV paid £175m to buy the operation in 2005, it expected to continue its red hot growth. Image copyright ITV Image caption By the time ITV made Friends Reunited free to use, many of its members had gone elsewhere But the broadcaster made the mistake of continuing to charge users to contact each other, rather than relying on ad revenue alone, for too long. That allowed Facebook, MySpace and Bebo to take the lead. ITV sold the business for just £25m in 2009. Although it limped on under other UK owners until earlier this year, it never regained its momentum. Lastfm.com (2002-2007) Image copyright Last.fm Image caption Last.fm offered users a free way to get a personalised online radio station Last.fm began its life as an internet radio station and an associated website where users listed the tracks they liked to meet others with similar tastes. But it only really took off after it merged with Audioscrobbler, a plug-in that automatically logged songs that its users had listened to on their computer and MP3 player. This made it possible to build up a deeper picture of its users' habits, which in turn helped the service make song recommendations, and then later suggest nearby concerts and music videos too. By 2007, the service had attracted 15 million users. However, rather than stay independent, its founders opted to sell out to the US media group CBS for $280m (£212m). Image copyright Last.fm Image caption The Last.fm Scrobbler tool automatically notified the service every time the user listened to a song They acknowledged that they had struggled to find a way to be profitable in light of the royalty and copyright fees the music industry was demanding, and said that teaming up with the US broadcaster gave them greater negotiating clout. However, the service continued to rack up losses. A subscription-based music streaming app was a flop, and these days Last.fm is a relatively minor player. It still recommends music but relies on YouTube, Spotify and other third-party services to provide it. Autonomy Image caption Mike Lynch and HP are still fighting a legal battle over the takeover of Autonomy Silicon Valley might have Google, but for a time Autonomy was the UK's most highly regarded search giant. The firm was founded in Cambridge in 1996 and developed software that allowed its clients to hunt through "unstructured data" - emails, videos, social network posts, phone calls, images and other information recorded in apps - that was not kept in neat databases. The service proved popular with a wide range of organisations, which used it to carry out legal checks, create archives and focus their marketing. In 2011, Autonomy proved its data-analysis techniques had further potential when it developed an augmented reality tool that allowed smartphones to superimpose graphics over real-world views. Image copyright Autonomy Image caption Autonomy's augmented reality app showed videos on an iPhone when it was held in front of a relevant poster Hollywood director JJ Abrams was among the first to use it within an app that promoted his film Super 8, and others followed. The same year, Autonomy's chief executive, Mike Lynch, agreed to sell the business to HP for just over £7bn. And that's where things got complicated. Thirteen months after the takeover was completed, HP claimed Mr Lynch had misrepresented his company's financial position and wrote down most of its value. The two sides are now suing each other in a case that is likely to drag on for years. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption HP's Meg Whitman: Her firm and Autonomy are suing each other In a final twist, HP has agreed to sell Autonomy and some of its other operations to Micro Focus, an English software developer, meaning what is left of the business will soon be controlled again from UK shores. ARM Holdings Image copyright Apple Image caption Apple took a stake in ARM Holdings to secure a chip for its Newton Until very recently, ARM Holdings was the flag-waver for the UK's tech scene. The computer chip designer was created in Cambridge in 1990 as a joint venture between Acorn Computers and Apple. The US firm wanted a processor to power its first hand-held device, the Newton MessagePad, but later sold its stake after Steve Jobs returned and ditched the product. That didn't end the relationship between the two companies though, as ARM's designs were used in processors that powered first the iPod, then the iPhone and iPad. Most other smartphones are also dependent on ARM's chip creations, in addition to a wide assortment of other technology including smart TVs, cars, fitness trackers, smartwatches and drones. Image copyright ARM Image caption ARM does not build chips itself but licenses its designs to others Many people thought ARM might remain independent as it suited device-makers not to have the firm owned by one of their competitors. But in July, Japan's Softbank agreed to pay £24bn for it. ARM's management suggested the move would help it "move faster in creating new technologies". But its co-founder Hermann Hauser has been critical, saying that ARM could have grown "even faster" if it had stayed solo. Swiftkey Image copyright Swiftkey Image caption Swiftkey anticipates words to prevent users having to enter letters individually The UK is famed for its expertise in artificial intelligence. But several of the sector's start-ups - including DeepMind, Magic Pony and VocalIQ - only became known to the wider public once they had fallen into Silicon Valley hands. Swiftkey was different because it actually brought popular products to market before being taken over. The London-based firm made a keyboard app for Android and iOS handsets. The software predicts what its users want to write - including emojis - after they have only entered a few keystrokes. Over time, its suggestions get more accurate as it studies their habits, and if allowed to review their social network posts, it gets better still. Swiftkey scored a publicity coup when its tech was adapted to help Prof Stephen Hawking type twice as fast as he could before. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Prof Hawking uses a version of Swiftkey's technology And in 2014, it decided to accelerate its growth further by making its app free to use, only charging consumers if they wanted to change the keyboard's design and colour. The tactic worked. By the end of 2015, Swiftkey had been installed on about 300 million devices. But it also caused its losses to grow. In February this year, the business was sold for a reported £250m to a deep-pocketed buyer. Image copyright PA Image caption Swiftkeys's founders, Jon Reynolds and Ben Medlock, are now multimillionaires "We believe joining Microsoft is the right next stage in our journey," its co-founders blogged. Maybe. But it also highlights how UK start-ups often feel pressured to sell once their early-stage funding starts to run out.

This holds true now more than ever, with farmers around the country using fertilisers or chemicals that are potentially harmful for the soil. To counter this, Grameen Intel Social Business Ltd (GISBL) introduced mrittikā, a soil test based fertiliser recommendation software three years back. In Khunla and Jessore they have been implementing the project with Solidaridad Network Asia. The project has been implemented so far in 40 locations in Bangladesh. GISBL has also been implementing this software in India and Cambodia to improve paddy production.  Right after its early stages, a pilot project was initiated to test mrittikā on a limited number of crops, including tomato, cauliflower and brinjal. Mrittikā works by identifying the current status of major soil nutrients and then accordingly suggesting the optimum amount of fertiliser and the type of fertiliser that should be used by the farmer. It does not end there; the software also identifies the amount by which fertiliser use can be reduced, thereby helping to optimise the whole process and contributing to healthier soils. To test the effectiveness of mrittikā, demo plots were used where fertilisers were used in three ways: as recommended by Grameen Intel's mrittikā app; as per the recommendations of the Bangladesh Agriculture Research Institute (BARI) handbook; and in accordance to traditional practice. One decimal of land was allotted for each of the methods. The three methods were used to measure the various outcomes and see where mrittikā stands in terms of efficiency. Once the crops were planted, it was time to monitor them; this was done by farmers, field organisers, technical officers and programme officers of the project. The outcome of the monitoring and evaluation exhibited the impact the mrittikā app can have: it showed higher yields than the BARI handbook and traditional methods, and showed that with mrittikā's fertiliser recommendations, fertiliser costs were also much lower. For instance, in the case of brinjal crops, the fertiliser cost in accordance to mrittikā recommendations were 29% lower than the BARI handbook method and an astonishing 468% lower than the traditional method. These are very significant differences, which is a clear indication of how much the whole process can be optimised while saving huge costs (almost over 400%) over traditional farming practices. With Bangladesh's growing population and high food demands needing to be met, it is essential to maximise all our outputs as well as protect our environment in order to keep growing more and more crops. Mrittikā is not only educating farmers on the ideal method of growing crops and the type and amount of fertiliser that ought to be used, it is helping us reduce a large amount of the costs to make farming processes more efficient and cheap at the same time. The mrittikā app is a very easy-to-implement system and a great initiative for Bangladesh and her farmers, helping them obtain a higher yield per taka spent on fertiliser. If implemented right all over Bangladesh, it is not only great for soil health around the country, but it will also allow farmers to achieve better standards of living and help fight the food shortage in Bangladesh.

In the fall of 2016, a new Macbook Pro is expected, and the latest rumors suggest that it will follow the iPhone 7 and come without a headphone jack. It looks like Apple is heading toward a wireless future, and a user took a screenshot of a survey where Apple asks whether MacBook Pro with Retina owners ever use the headphone jack. @MacRumors pic.twitter.com/ly1xz6Biu7 — Blake A. (@mmodelmusic) September 15, 2016 It makes sense that Apple will also release future products without the headphone port to support the Apple ecosystem among newer device editions. The new MacBook Pro is rumored to come with a touch panel with Touch ID functionality that will allow users quick access with fingerprint login. This may be featured on the MacBook Pro’s power button or Apple may decide to put the fingerprint access functionally on the touchpad. The fingerprint scan may also come with its own strip. The update will also feature a design overhaul with a thinner frame than the currently available models. According to a Bloomberg report, a source stated that the new graphics processor will be powerful enough to run powerful video games. “The updated notebooks will be thinner, include a touch screen strip for function keys, and will be offered with more powerful and efficient graphics processors for expert users such as video gamers, said the people, who asked not to be named.” Is the MacBook Pro next to get rid of the headphone jack? https://t.co/WFjOnkpg4t pic.twitter.com/0w0zNx2Xxk — TechRadar (@techradar) September 18, 2016 The late Steve Jobs believed that tablets will eventually replace laptops all together. However, Apple’s 13- and 15-inch Retina MacBook Pros are still in high demand and are trending to perform better than the iPad. Bloomberg also reported on Apple potential abandoning the Intel processor. “An option for a version featuring a higher-performance graphics chip from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. will be available, another person familiar with the matter said. It’s unclear which provider Apple will use for the main processor, but Intel Corp. has supplied this in the past.” Apple is most likely to use Intel’s latest-generation Skylake processors in the new MacBook. However, its sole competitor AMD may offer a better processor that suits the thinner model expected to be released in 2016. “Apple is using one of AMD’s ‘Polaris’ graphics chips because the design offers the power efficiency and thinness necessary to fit inside the slimmer Apple notebook, the person said. The new graphics card is more than 20 percent thinner than its predecessor, AMD said earlier this year. AMD declined to comment, referring inquiries to Apple.” There are also rumors that Apple may be using its own chip on the new MacBook Pro line. The A10 Fusion chip in the iPhone 7 could be upgraded or developed for the MacBook Pro. The A10 also technically has the power to handle the performance of a laptop. There is no expectation of any changes with the colors of the MacBook Pro, and a 13-inch and 15-inch model will probably make a comeback. The laptop is expected to feature USB-C ports and USB 3.1 Gen 2 10Gb/s support. This will support very high transfer speeds of up to 10GB per second, allowing you to transfer huge files almost instantly. OLED touch panel is expected to have screens that change, depending on what application you are using. This will feature a touch sensitive strip, which allows you to choose certain functions available on the given application. The new MacBook Pro event is expected in October 2016 and will feature very significant changes since it has been almost four years without an update. Are you looking forward to the MacBook Pro? Which features are you hoping Apple will include? Leave your comments below.

Capcom's Street Fighter V installs hidden rootkit on PCs ARM emits Cortex-R52 Popular Bash shell script LetsEncrypt.sh, which is used to manage free SSL/TLS certificates from the Let's Encrypt project, has renamed this week to avoid a trademark row. This comes in the wake of Let's Encrypt successfully fending off Comodo, which tried to cynically snatch "Let's Encrypt" for itself. LetsEncrypt.sh, written by Germany-based Lukas Schauer, is now known as Dehydrated. If you have scripts or apps that rely on pulling in his code and running it, they may stop working as a result of the name change. Dehydrated is developed independently by Schauer and is not officially affiliated with Let's Encrypt. "This project was renamed from letsencrypt.sh because the original name was violating Let's Encrypt's trademark policy. I know that this results in quite a lot of installations failing but I didn't have a choice," reads the new Dehydrated README. Schauer told El Reg this week that the Let's Encrypt project sent him "a very friendly email, asking me very kindly to change the name" of LetsEncrypt.sh, while referencing "their trademark policy and that they didn't want confusion on what really belongs to Let's Encrypt." "There was no direct threat, but it was very clear that I couldn't keep the name for much longer," Schauer added. Let's Encrypt issues free security certificates for HTTPS websites, is backed by various big names, and recommends people use the Python-based Certbot to deploy its SSL/TLS certs. Certbot, developed by the EFF, was previously called the Let's Encrypt Client. In June this year, the Let's Encrypt project was fighting off Comoodo, a paid-for SSL/TLS certificate issuer that was trying to trademark "Let's Encrypt" for itself, presumably so it could snuff out its free-for-all competition. This is despite the Let's Encrypt project first using the term way back in 2014, and that Comodo has never, er, used the words "let's encrypt" in its product branding. In July, the Let's Encrypt project prevailed and registered "Let's Encrypt" as a trademark with the US Patent and Trademark Office: it is now mark number 87096675 and belongs to San Francisco's Internet Security Research Group, which runs the organization. It even owns the pseudo mark "Let Us Encrypt" for anyone who hates apostrophe contractions. With that win comes extra responsibility: trademark holders must use and defend their marks or lose them. If you allow other businesses and groups to use your trademark willy-nilly, it may be considered abandoned by a court. Thus, the Let's Encrypt project is working on getting as many of the third-party Let's Encrypt tools – like LetsEncrypt.sh – renamed if they feature the words Let's Encrypt in order to actively protect its trademark. "I did ask [Lukas Schauer] to change the name," Let's Encrypt chief Josh Aas confirmed to The Register this week. "It's something we need to do in order to protect our trademarks and avoid creating confusion as to where the software comes from. Also, we use an open protocol that we're encouraging other certificate authorities to adopt, and when that happens we want it to be clear that ACME clients can be used with CAs besides Let's Encrypt. "These are all of the same reasons that we had the name of the official Let's Encrypt client changed to Certbot when it moved to the EFF, and we've been talking to other client projects with similar trademark issues." "All of that said, we're really grateful for Lukas's contribution to our client ecosystem," Aas added. ® Full disclosure: This article's author uses Let's Encrypt to provide HTTPS encryption for his personal websites.

The world’s largest maker of semiconductors has been suffering from a global slide in demand for PCs because people increasingly prefer their tablets or mobile phones. Now, Intel is seeing signs of “replenishment of PC supply chain inventory,” indicating that PC makers are stocking up on key components for computers after years of sliding sales that left hardware gathering dust on shelves. It is also “seeing some signs of improving PC demand,” the company said in a statement on Friday. Intel chief executive officer Brian Krzanich is looking for new ways to fuel growth in areas such as drones, robots and everyday items like connected air-conditioners, while still depending on its traditional businesses, including products that power PCs and mobile phones. In addition to the PC gains, the company’s forecast indicates Intel might be benefiting from chips that are now being placed in some of Apple Inc’s iPhones, according to Timothy Arcuri, an analyst with Cowen & Co. “They also had this iPhone stuff in their back pocket, which is now coming through,” Arcuri said. “I do think PCs are better — there’s enough data points to suggest that — but it’s not just PCs.” Intel shares rose 3 percent to US$37.67 at the close in New York, the biggest single-day jump in about nine months and the highest value since December 2014. The stock has gained 9.3 percent this year. Intel’s new forecast is for revenue of US$15.6 billion, plus or minus US$300 million. The previous projection from the Santa Clara, California-based company was US$14.9 billion, plus or minus US$500 million. Analysts on average had estimates in line with the company’s original outlook. Intel also boosted its forecast for adjusted gross margin by one point, now expecting the midpoint at 63 percent, plus or minus a couple of percentage points. Shipments of PCs, a market that provides Intel with more than half of its sales, fell to their lowest level in a decade in the first three months of this year. However, by the second quarter, the rate of decline in PC shipments had slowed, as demand in North America helped blunt weakness across the rest of the industry. Some analysts were hesitant to call this a turnaround yet. “PCs are doing better, no doubt about it,” said C.J. Muse, an analyst at Evercore ISI. “I wouldn’t call it rapid change. I think when you look at depleted inventory in the channel plus the pessimistic attitude coming in, we were set up for things to come in a little better than expectations.” This story has been viewed 1722 times.

Source: Chipworks Chipworks performed a teardown of the iPhone7 which did not stop at just taking the unit apart. The teardown goes even further into the specific chips used in the A1778 iPhone 7 model which they have gotten their hands on. This model is used on AT&T or T-Mobile and other GSM networks. Its not known (but likely) that the CDMA variants connecting to Sprint or Verizon stuck to Qualcomm for their modems. An entire mobile cellular platform was found in the iPhone 7 including a modem (with model number XMM7360), two RF transceivers, and a power management integrated circuit. If you wish to get into the nitty gritty of the chips and their descriptions, you can head over to the source link below. Chipworks says it will get a Verizon unit and confirm whether or not the CDMA variant also makes use of these Intel chips.

Image Source: Ars Technica Dell subsidiary Alienware claims that virtual reality (VR) laptops will soon compete with established video game consoles like the Nintendo Wii U. The computer hardware company launched its VR-ready Alienware 17, 15, and 13 laptops at the Tokyo Game Show 2016. Even though VR rigs like these are still relatively expensive, Alienware global marketing director Joe Olmsted thinks its mobility aspect will allow them to become the new home entertainment device. The new Alienware laptops have VR capability thanks to NVIDIA’s GTX 10-Series graphics, but they are only another step in a major scheme. Olmsted claims the next-generation VR-ready Alienware notebook coupled with the HTC Vive or Oculus Rift will be the future of gaming. Olmsted considers the GTX 10-Series as the biggest performance jump he’s ever seen on laptops. It easily surpasses Alienware’s previous effort, the Alpha R2 mini PC powered by the older GTX 960. Alienware’s gaming PCs and laptops aim to compete with consoles Founded in 1996 to develop and sell gaming PCs and laptops, Alienware was bought by Dell in March 2006. The new subsidiary became Dell’s premier gaming brand in 2008, and it released the M17x laptop, the first Alienware/Dell system, in 2009. In 2014, Alienware announced that it would release a series of Windows OS-based video game consoles to compete with Sony’s PlayStation, the Nintendo Wii U, and Microsoft’s Xbox One. The first version, the Alpha, runs Windows 8.1 and allows to play PC games. Alienware Unveiled A Host Of Updated Products At E3, Showoff VR Backpack. Image Source: Mike Shouts At E3 2016, Alienware unveiled the Alpha R2 with sixth generation Intel processors and NVIDIA GeForce 960 graphics card. It runs Windows 10 and supports Alienware’s proprietary Graphics Amplifier. Alienware 17, 15, and 13 laptops before the next-gen gaming notebook The next stage ahead of the next-gen gaming laptop, which apparently Olmsted is already using, are Alienware’s 17, 15, and 13 laptops. The thinner lineup comes equipped with VR and the latest NVIDIA laptop cards. Alienware’s big-screen 17 sports the top-end NVIDIA GTX 1080 chip, while the Alienware 15 and 13 champion the GTX 1070 and 1060, respectively. All three models support the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive VR headsets. The new laptops feature sixth-generation Intel Core i7 CPUs instead of the next-gen Kaby Lake. However, the flagship 17-inch version will get a K series Intel processor. The 15- and 17-inch models have 1080p IPS screens, 2667 MHz DDR4 RAM, TactX keyboards, and can support up to 10 keys at once. Although Dell hasn’t revealed pricing yet, release dates for the trio are already known. The 15- and 17-inch models will hit US stores on September 30th, while the 13-inch will be made available sometime in November.

Samsung Electronics saw its chip sales reach US$9.45 billion in the April-June period to account for 11.3 percent of the global chip market, while Intel's shipments stood at $12.27 billion with a 14.7 percent market share, according to the data compiled by industry tracker IHS. While the gap between the two stood at 5.3 percentage points in 2012, it gradually narrowed to 4.2 percentage points in 2013 and 3.2 percentage points in 2015. IHS said the narrowed gap in the second quarter resulted from a surge in Samsung's sales of NAND flash memory products that are widely used in smartphones and laptops. U.S.-based Qualcomm Inc. and Broadcom Ltd. followed with 4.6 percent and 4.3 percent market shares, respectively. Samsung's smaller local rival SK hynix Inc. took the 5th spot with a 4 percent market share. khj@yna.co.kr (END) Most Viewed Seoul to ban smoking at cultural asset sites (4th LD) Park apologizes over alleged sexual misconduct by ex-spokesman Ssangyong says resumption of overnight shift turning point of normalization (2nd LD) N.

Few things motivate Samsung employees like the opportunity to take advantage of weakness at Apple Inc. QuickTake Samsung Earlier this year, managers at the South Korean company began hearing the next iPhone wouldn’t have any eye-popping innovations. The device would look just like the previous two models too. It sounded like a potential opening for Samsung to leap ahead. Jay Y. Lee Photographer: SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg So the top brass at Samsung Electronics Co., including phone chief D.J. Koh, decided to accelerate the launch of a new phone they were confident would dazzle consumers and capitalize on the opportunity, according to people familiar with the matter. They pushed suppliers to meet tighter deadlines, despite loads of new features, another person with direct knowledge said. The Note 7 would have a high-resolution screen that wraps around the edges, iris-recognition security and a more powerful, faster-charging battery. Apple’s taunts that Samsung was a copycat would be silenced for good. Then it all backfired. Just days after Samsung introduced the Note 7 in August, reports surfaced online that the phone’s batteries were bursting into flame. By the end of the month, there were dozens of fires and Samsung was rushing to understand what went wrong. On Sept. 2, Koh held a grim press conference in Seoul where he announced Samsung would replace all 2.5 million phones shipped so far. What was supposed to be triumph had turned into a fiasco. For a QuickTake Q&A explainer on Samsung’s battery fiasco, click here Samsung drew criticism for the recall too. It announced the plans publicly before working out how millions of consumers in 10 countries would actually get replacements. Then it sent mixed signals about what customers should do. First, Samsung told people to shut off their phones and stop using them. A few days later, it offered a software patch to prevent batteries from overheating, signaling consumers could keep using the phones. "This is creating an enormous problem for the company -- for its reputation and ability to support its customers when there’s a problem," said David Yoffie, a management professor at Harvard Business School and board member at Intel Corp. and smartphone vendor HTC Corp. Samsung declined to comment specifically on whether it moved up the Note 7 launch because of its perception of the iPhone. “Timing of any new mobile product launch is determined by the Mobile business division based on the proper completion of the development process and the readiness of the product for the market,” the company said in a statement. The misstep has set off soul-searching at the Samsung conglomerate and in South Korea, where the company employs hundreds of thousands and is revered for leading the nation’s rise since the Korean War. Samsung’s flagship electronics unit built its reputation on high-quality products and cutting-edge technology, becoming the largest phone maker in the world and a powerful rival to Apple in innovation. One employee, in an online discussion group, called the episode "humiliating." The crisis is straining a management team that’s been without clear leadership for more than two years. Lee Kun-Hee, the Samsung patriarch who is chairman of both the electronics unit and the broader conglomerate, suffered a heart attack in 2014 and hasn’t been back to the business since. His son, Jay Y. Lee, is heir apparent, but hasn’t taken his father’s title because Korean culture precludes such a move while the elder Lee is alive. The result is that no one appears to have the kind of authority that, say, Tim Cook wields at Apple to take responsibility and hammer out solutions. “The battery issue arrived at the worst moment for Samsung and it seems like there was a delay in reacting to this communication crisis,” said Thomas Husson, an analyst at Forrester Research. “This may indeed be due to the change in top management.” Samsung said in the statement that its focus now is on doing the right thing for customers and that it is working to replace the Note 7s as quickly as possible. “For us at Samsung, to earn consumers’ trust back is very important.” For a Gadfly column on Samsung’s strategic challenges, click here. The roots of the battery crisis can be traced back more than a year, when Samsung was contemplating what features to include in new phones. The Korean company has two primary lines of premium devices, the Galaxy S and the larger Note. When the Note was first unveiled in 2011, it was panned by some critics, who mocked its massive screen. But it was a surprise hit with customers seeking the added real estate to watch videos, play games and browse the web. Samsung pretty much had the high end of the oversized smartphone market to itself until Apple followed with its larger iPhone 6 Plus in 2014. The Plus’s debut put pressure on Samsung to defend its turf and it moved up the 2015 introduction of the new Note from September to August, just weeks before Apple unveiled the iPhone 6s. Samsung’s engineers met the deadline, but Apple still grabbed a chunk of market share. In December, the chief of Samsung’s mobile division was replaced. The 55-year-old Koh, a company veteran who had managed development of several Galaxy phones, took his place on the hot seat. Koh faced not just intensifying competition with Apple but slower growth as the whole smartphone market became saturated. When Samsung became aware that Apple didn’t plan any major design changes, the Korean executives saw an opportunity. After a select group of top managers got their hands on early versions of the Note, they gushed over the upgrades and praised each other’s work, according to one of the people. If Apple wasn’t going to offer consumers anything exciting, Samsung certainly would. With Chairman Lee in the hospital, the younger Lee and co-vice chairman G.S. Choi huddled with Koh and executives of other Samsung affiliates, which make semiconductors, glass panels and batteries. They went ahead with a slew of new features that had been on the company’s product road map, including an improved screen and stylus -- and then approved a launch date 10 days earlier than last year, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. Samsung’s unveiling was Aug. 3 this year, compared with Aug. 13 last year. The battery is a critical component. Smartphone makers have been pushing the boundaries of the technology for years as they try to satisfy consumer demands for long-lasting devices that charge faster. That increases manufacturing challenges and raises the risks of defects. Samsung opted to give the Note 7 a 3500 milliampere hour battery compared with 3000 mAh for the previous model. For comparison, the iPhone 7 Plus has a 2900 mAh battery. The main battery supplier for the Note 7 was Samsung SDI Co., a person with knowledge of the matter has said. The company, founded in 1970 and 20 percent owned by Samsung Electronics, makes batteries for other phone-makers too, including Apple. The Galaxy Note 7 Photographer: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg As the launch date approached, employees at Samsung and suppliers stretched their work hours and made do with less sleep. Though it’s not unusual to have a scramble, suppliers were under more pressure than usual this time around and were pushed harder than by other customers, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. One supplier said it was particularly challenging to work with Samsung employees this time, as they repeatedly changed their minds about specs and work flow. Some Samsung workers began sleeping in the office to avoid time lost in commuting, the supplier said. Samsung declined to comment on whether deadlines were moved, reiterating that products are only introduced after proper testing. Still, by August, it looked like Samsung had made it. The company shipped early models of the Note 7 to wireless operators around the world, including AT&T Inc. in the U.S. and Telstra Corp. in Australia. An executive at one carrier said his team started testing the device in May and had the typical amount of time to check its capabilities. They focused on antenna performance and data speeds and didn’t uncover the battery problem, the executive said. But when customers started using the phones, the fires began. The first signs of trouble emerged online, as they’re wont to do in this age of social media. Photos and videos of charred phones were posted on the web. “Hey YouTube,” said one man, as he described how his phone had burst into flame and showed off the blackened remains. “Be careful out there. Everyone rockin’ the new Note 7, it might catch fire y’all.” Executives at Samsung headquarters in Suwon were in shock. Choi, the co-vice chairman, gathered senior managers, demanding to know what went wrong, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. The phone division pointed fingers at battery maker Samsung SDI, while managers there argued the problem could be elsewhere, including in the phone design or insulation. Samsung said there is no ongoing debate on the issue and that the phone unit has taken responsibility. Samsung’s top managers knew they needed to move fast. Internally, there was a debate about whether to do a full-blown recall or to take less dramatic steps, like a battery replacement program. Then on Sept. 1, an engineer wrote on the company’s internal online bulletin board. “Please recall all Note7s and exchange them with new ones. I don’t have to get my PS,” he said, referring to his profit sharing, or bonus. “It’s humiliating.” The post prompted many impassioned responses, mostly in support of the idea. Another worker said Samsung had trained everyone at the company to make no compromises with customers and the company needed a recall to live up to that standard. Then Koh himself weighed in. He apologized to employees and said he would consider their input in taking the appropriate steps. The next day, Koh went public with the full recall. For details of the U.S. recall, click here. Samsung engineers rushed to determine the cause of the problem, working through the Harvest Festival holiday last week. The company’s most complete explanations so far have come in reports to government agencies in Korea, China and the U.S. The initial conclusions indicated an error in production that put pressure on plates within the battery cells. That in turn brought negative and positive poles into contact, triggering excessive heat that caused the battery to explode. The chairman of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission was more explicit when his agency announced an official recall on Thursday. He said the phone’s battery was slightly too big for its compartment and the tight space pinched the battery, causing a short circuit. “Clearly, they missed something,” said Anthea Lai, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “They were rushing to beat Apple and they made a mistake.” As it investigates, Samsung has stopped buying batteries for the Note 7 from the SDI affiliate. It shifted purchases to Amperex Technology Ltd., a unit of Japan’s TDK Corp., according to local media reports. “After extensive testing and as reported to multiple regulatory agencies, this issue is isolated to the battery cell from one supplier only,” the company said in its statement. “All replacement Galaxy Note 7 devices will have batteries from other suppliers.” A spokesman for Samsung SDI said the company’s stance on the recall is in line with what’s been previously announced by Samsung’s mobile unit and declined to elaborate. The replacement program is prompting more reflection. The fast response was driven by good intentions. Samsung managers have studied past product recalls, including those at Toyota Motor Corp., and the conclusion seemed clear: Move quickly and dramatically. But Samsung moved so fast it got ahead of regulators who help organize such programs. In the U.S. for example, companies are supposed to notify the Consumer Product Safety Commission within 24 hours of uncovering problems. Instead, Samsung went public on its own and consumers didn’t have clear guidance on how to exchange their phones. “The official recall process provides a lot of clarity to consumers and there’s someone checking to make sure the fix is a good one that serves the consumers in terms of safety,” said Jerry Beilinson, a technology editor at Consumer Reports. Samsung, which may pay as much as $2 billion for the recall, said on Sunday it sold stakes in ASML Holding NV, Seagate Technology Plc, Rambus Inc. and Sharp Corp. for a total value of about 1 trillion won ($891 million). While Samsung says Galaxy Note 7 sales will resume in Korea around Sept. 28, it has yet to specify when global sales would resume.

In the wake of the recall, Samsung said it had nominated the younger Lee to join the company’s nine-member board, a move that will give him a more active, and legitimate, role across its businesses. However, the younger Lee, who has kept a low profile inside and outside the company, is still far from having the kind of direct authority his father had. In addition to the corporate strategy office that oversees about 60 Samsung companies, Samsung Electronics has three CEOs. “This is a crisis and a blow to Samsung’s image,” said Kim Sang Jo, economics professor at Hansung University in Seoul. “Clearly there were procedural missteps and the company will have to restore consumer and investor confidence.” Apple’s iPhone 7 also wasn’t as uninspiring as Samsung may have anticipated. Though it kept the same physical design with modest technology changes, loyalists still lined up at stores around the world on Friday to get the company’s latest gadget. Twenty years ago, in a chapter of Samsung Group history that employees can recite by heart, Chairman Lee grew so frustrated by faulty mobile phones that he piled up thousands of the devices and lit the whole heap ablaze. Never compromise on quality, he exhorted the workers watching, putting Samsung on course to become the top seller of mobile phones in the world. Today, Samsung phones are ablaze once again, only this time the flames threaten the company’s hard-won image. “The potential damage to reputation is far greater than short-term financial losses,” said Chang Sea Jin, a professor at National University of Singapore.

(A24) Share Written by Olivia Goldhill Obsession Machines with Brains September 18, 2016 When you talk to an AI chatbot, who do you think writes those professional, peppy responses? There’s certainly an algorithm behind the scenes, but humans put together those phrases. Tech companies are creating teams of writers, including playwrights, poets, and novelists, to help write lines that don’t sound like they came from a machine. The work can range from creating a consistent character for a chatbot, to inspiring an immersive virtual reality. Jonathan Foster, manager for Cortana’s editorial team at Microsoft, heads a team of 22 writers around the world who help give Cortana, Microsoft’s personal assistant, a consistent voice. Foster has worked as a film and TV screenwriter in Hollywood (and continues to write screenplays on the side), but he says he’s fascinated by the immersive challenge of writing for tech. He and his team have a detailed set of principles that define Cortana’s character and work to make sure the dialog reflects her voice. “She isn’t a chatty teenager, she’s a professional assistant,” he says. And so Cortana is positive without being naïve or chipper, and steers clear of dark humor. “The nuance of what a writer can do sometimes looks a lot easier than it actually is,” says Foster. “Conversation seems simple because we do it every day but when you have to write it in a logical way that doesn’t feel broken, it takes a new kind of expertise that’s just burgeoning.” Foster’s writers include poets, playwrights, novelists, and the author of children’s books. They don’t try to convince users that Cortana is human, and in fact make very clear that she’s artificial. When it comes to difficult and divisive questions, such as the election, Foster’s team avoids alienating users and has Cortana instead suggest that such topics are best left for human discussion. In other areas, Cortana has firm views. Foster says his team changed its position on Cortana’s favorite film, for example. “We used to do a more pervasive ‘I don’t have an opinion about that.’ But when we saw people were asking, we realized they really want to know what her favorite movie is,” he says. And so the team picked Star Trek, which aligns with her science fiction personality. Writing for tech companies can be more involved than composing a script for a chatbot. Nathan Phillips, playwright and co-founder of a creative agency in New York, has worked for Intel and as a collaborator on the Google Creative Lab, among other tech projects. His projects include a mixed reality experience for Intel, where fish (including turtle that measured time and a whale that lit up when it found the strongest wifi signal) would eat the 3G and wifi waves that surround us, making them visible as they consumed them. He’s also worked on an interactive billboard, and an interactive documentary that creates a film about the viewer based on responses to questions. Though Phillips understands tech fairly well, he refuses to talk about it when building the projects. “There has to be someone who adamantly refuses to talk about how it works but instead talks about what it is,’ he says. The biggest difference in writing for VR rather than a play, for example, is that the writer is making the user the protagonist rather than trying to show the actions of the protagonist. Otherwise, Phillips believes the central concept is the most important element, and it’s just a matter of how it’s expressed. “There’s no such thing as a VR idea or a book idea,” he says. “There’s an idea that requires you use VR to convey it, or idea that requires you have a book to convey it. Think about how many incredible stories have been lost because someone was like ‘I write books.’ When you stop focusing on how it works and start focusing on what it is, you can push into a realm of idea-focused innovation.” Both Phillips and Foster note that writing for tech can have a significant impact. Users have an emotional response when they talk to AI, says Foster. Writers are shaping the layer technological information that exists everywhere and is largely invisible. Philips says messaging applications such as WhatsApp will get smarter, will know more about you and how to respond. “As a writer, that’s something that is and will be very much part of my job,” he says. “Figuring out what those voices are, what type of personality they have, should they feel like machines.” Writers will also have to help users feel comfortable using this technology, and give them agency as they move “from VR to AR to MR to talking to a human or an enhanced human.” Storytelling have existed for millennia, says Phillips, but thanks partly to such phenomena as reality TV, the film equipment inside our phones, and the rise of virtual reality, the line between fiction and reality is blurring. “If you get rid of the writer, all you have is the technology,” he says. “You have no one taking advantage of the fact that reality is over.” Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

News Rumor: Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare Xbox One Beta Release Date Revealed Share Tweet by Damian Seeto on September 18, 2016 The release date for the Xbox One beta of Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare may have been leaked thanks to the Microsoft Store. It’s only a few days after the PS4 gets it. As reported by Charlie Intel, the Microsoft Store briefly showed the release date for the beta on Xbox One. They posted: “Beta starts October 21, 2016 on Xbox One. Availability and launch date(s) subject to change. See www.callofduty.com/beta for more details. Minimum Beta duration is 3 days.” The information about the Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare beta release date has now been removed from the Microsoft Store. Activision has yet to officially announce the beta dates for PC and Xbox One owners so this is why this is being posted as a rumor for now. For PS4 owners, the beta starts on October 14th. You have to pre-order the game either digitally or physically at a retail store in order to gain access to it. An October 21st date seems feasible since a beta will need to be done before the full game comes out on November 4th, 2016. We will let you know if the beta date changes when Activision gives out an official announcement for it. Infinite Warfare is the newest Call of Duty title to be developed by Infinity Ward.

HDCP 2.x is in many ways different from HDCP 1.x, and likely to cause as many interoperability issues as its older brother did – unless system designers understand a few key points. The formats are not compatible, but awareness of the differences and similarities, along with the relationship to HDMI 2 and 4K, will help you ensure seamless end-to-end support for old and new HDCP material in all your installations. 1 THE SOURCE MAKES ALL DECISIONS It is important to understand this first, and it makes good sense when you think about it. The source is the gatekeeper of the content, whether that content is delivered via the internet or a spinning plastic disc. The source knows the demands of the content itself, and implements those demands by enabling HDCP protection or not. 2 HDCP 1.X AND HDCP 2.X ARE NOT COMPATIBLE Not compatible? It’s okay. There’s no real problem with that. A year ago, the source’s decision was simple: to enable HDCP or not. But in the past year or so, a new version of HDCP has entered the world. (Note: the latest versions of the two major HDCP revisions are HDCP 1.4 and HDCP 2.2. The minor differences in the sub-version number – e.g. HDCP 1.2 vs 1.4, or HDCP 2.0 vs 2.2 – are not critical to understand. Therefore, I use the shorthand “HDCP 1.x” and “HDCP 2.x” to refer to the two major versions that now coexist in the market. In fact, practically all real products use versions 1.4 and 2.2 exclusively.) HDCP 2.x is a complete re-write of the HDCP specification, with no backward compatibility. That sounds terrible, but in fact it’s not a big problem. There are no HDMI transceiver chips that provide HDCP 2.x without support also for HDCP 1.x. Both systems are included on the same chip. This means the products you encounter that support HDCP 2.x will also support HDCP 1.x. 3 HDCP 2.X OFFERS MUCH STRONGER ENCRYPTION A major component of any content protection scheme is its encryption. HDCP 1.x used a custom-built scheme designed to be simple and cheap to implement. This may be why HDCP 1.x was “cracked” in 2010. In September of that year, Intel (the creator of HDCP) confirmed that a master key had been made public. This key makes it possible to generate valid decryption keys and totally defeat HDCP 1.x protection. A key upgrade to HDCP 2.x is the use of AES-128 encryption. This is the same encryption used for secure government and business communication all over the world. If AES- 128 is broken, we’ll have bigger problems than a few pirated movies! 4 THERE ARE NO TECHNICAL LINKS WITH HDMI 2.0 OR 4K This one is simple. There is nothing in the HDMI specification that says you have to use HDCP 2.x (or, for that matter, that you must use HDCP at all). And by extension, there is no technical rule or standard that says 4K content must be protected by HDCP 2.x. 5 THERE ARE DE FACTO LINKS Practically speaking, we will see all Hollywood 4K content demanding HDCP 2.x protection. HDCP 2.x was really invented by and for Hollywood, who felt that the protection offered by HDCP 1.x is not sufficient for their valuable 4K intellectual property. This is probably a reasonable position, considering the broken cryptography of HDCP 1.x. 6 EVERY SINGLE DEVICE IN THE CHAIN MUST COOPERATE Once a source has decided on the content protection required, the content goes out with the protection applied. Of course this means that the display device must support the same level of protection in order to decrypt the signal. But it also means that every piece of electronics in the chain – transmitters, receivers and switches – must support the content protection. If you have a source insisting on HDCP 2.x and a three year old HDMI switch that can only support HDCP 1.x, you get a dead end and a black screen. 7 SOME HDCP 2.X CONTENT CAN BE DOWNGRADED TO HDCP 1.X This again comes down to decision making by the source, driven by the content. The first 4K Blu-ray player to hit the market (by Samsung) will allow an image out with only HDCP 1.x protection. However, when it allows this, it forces the image to the scaled down to 1080p. Again, this is a demand of Hollywood – that their 4K content must be protected by HDCP 2.x. There is no guarantee that a source will behave this way, so it is certainly best to assume you will need HDCP 2.x gear everywhere. 8 HDCP 2.X IS ETHERNETFRIENDLY HDCP 2.x finally means that protected content (even HDCP 1.x) may be moved across an Ethernet network. Despite claims (and products!) from various manufacturers of video-over- IP gear, the HDCP 1.x specification is very clear about what can (and what cannot) be done with HDCP 1.x protected content. It cannot be transmitted across an Ethernet network without violating that specification. HDCP 2.x has introduced a new set of rules and techniques which finally do allow this. In fact, even HDCP 1.x content may be upgraded to HDCP 2.x, transmitted across the network according to HDCP 2.x rules, and then downgraded to HDCP 1.x content for output to a display at the far end. HDCP 2.x content may also be transmitted across Ethernet, but of course must still be protected by HDCP 2.x at the end.

Telecoms software outfit Brite:bill got a sum of around €70m from US competitor Amdocs. A few weeks before, Dublin chip designer Movidius agreed to an Intel bid estimated at over €300m. Both sales are (rightly) hailed as success stories for their founders and backers. But with both having shown such bright futures, selling up now leaves a question dangling about what might have been. Could Movidius have become a major multinational? Might Brite:bill have expanded into a software powerhouse? Or should we care that the desire to sell means we may never grow a Spotify, a Soundcloud or a Deliveroo? "It's a fair question," says Brian Caulfield, a partner in venture capital firm Draper Esprit, one of the successful investors in Movidius's recent exit. "But Ireland is a small country. And undercapitalisation is a problem." Caulfield says that tech firms funded from US sources have far more financial leeway to scale for longer because of bigger, more flexible funding rounds. He says that founders have mortgages to pay and families to feed. In a stricter funding environment than that available in other countries, a healthy takeover offer has significant appeal. "When you look at a company like Movidius, those guys have been on the road for 11 years, some of it quite hard. You can't really blame them." To be fair, Movidius is a strong case in favour of Caulfield's argument. In the semiconductor industry, there's no overnight hypergrowth as seen in the software industry. Sales channels are specialised without the flick-of-a-switch installation economics of other sectors. In this context, Intel offered Movidius a golden chance to develop its technology further while rewarding the company's founders and backers to the tune of €300m. Who would turn that down? (Not me). And yet there's still a nagging question that persists. Movidius had developed a ground-breaking chip that gives 'sight' and some intelligence to all sorts of machines and gadgets (including the latest drones). It was tipped to be Ireland's first 'unicorn' (a private company with a valuation of more than $1bn). Would it have become a flagbearer for Irish technology, renowned around the world? We'll never know. As strong and enabling as Intel's environment will undoubtedly be, the old giant will have its own rules and priorities for what Movidius may or may not develop in the future. To reiterate, the Movidius exit can not be characterised as anything but a success for all involved. And the company's founders are undoubtedly the right people to decide what was, and is, in the company's best interest going forward. The same is true for Brite:bill, which brilliantly targeted a billing niche in the telecoms industry. But if Movidius and Brite:bill were based in San Jose, Jerusalem or Berlin, would they have hung on to see how far they could take the company organically? Israel is a small country with a population only half as big as ours. It has 93 companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange. Some, such as the €9bn computer vision firm Mobileye, are world-beating players that remain headquartered in Israel with the majority of research happening there. Granted, the country's massive institutional spending on defence gives it a head start in engineering and tech spin-offs. But there is surely still as much risk for those start-ups on the issue of scaling and selling as there is for Irish ones. It should be added that Irish tech companies do sometimes break through. Fleetmatics raised around €100m when it floated in the US in 2012. This summer, the company was acquired for €2.15bn by Verizon. Maybe none of this really matters. Maybe what does matter is a higher number of companies coming through the ranks. This is unquestionably happening. But it would be exciting to have our very own Stripe sometime. Should we care that startups' desire to sell means we may never grow a Spotify, a Soundcloud or a Deliveroo?

Few states have more at stake than Oregon. By Patrick Reiten In this unorthodox political year, some of the most volatile issues point toward a single problem: Too many Americans who once earned enough to provide a stable living for their families by working in factories have lost those jobs and can't find comparable work in other occupations. This angst and the political movements it has helped launch have led both major-party presidential nominees to oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Each candidate has identified other scapegoats as well, from immigrants to Wall Street. Little, if any, of this conversation has been productive. In 2012, Oregon ranked second among states for the percentage of gross domestic product attributed to manufacturing, 27.7 percent. Only Indiana at 28.2 percent was higher. Manufacturers across Oregon are providing family-wage jobs: the average manufacturing wage in 2014 was $64,000, compared with $46,500 for all jobs, according to the Oregon Employment Department. Associated Oregon Industries is hosting the Oregon Manufacturers' Roundtable on Tuesday in Salem, at which businesses will discuss the everyday obstacles they must overcome to produce and sell goods – and provide family-wage jobs – in Oregon. Those who come will hear some good news: The solutions to these challenges are much simpler than building a wall or renegotiating trade treaties. Successful manufacturers have business models that work in a global, technologically advanced economy. They make high-quality products that meet the needs of their customers. These products require a skilled workforce, and companies have found those workers in Oregon. Intel ships semiconductors produced in Oregon around the world. Other global giants, including Boeing and Daimler, also make products in Oregon. Home-grown companies such as Nike and Tillamook have internationally recognized brands. Greenbrier Companies' Oregon-made products command respect in the rail and barge industries. And forest products manufacturers have long been a cornerstone for the state economy. These and other large manufacturers are an essential part of the state's economic foundation, but it requires businesses of all sizes to build a sustainable economy that can provide jobs and hope to future generations – the type of hope that younger voters have shown that they are longing for in this election season. To create that hope, Oregon must nurture its smaller, less-known manufacturers. Companies such as Oregon Aero of Scappoose that makes flight-related products ranging from headsets and helmets to seating systems. Or Miles Fiberglass Components in Oregon City that produces fiberglass and composite components for products as diverse as recreational vehicles and wind turbines. They succeed in competitive product categories by doing their job well and meeting customers' needs. And when they succeed, they spend more money with suppliers, helping other Oregon companies add jobs. Share your opinion Submit your essay of 700 words or less to commentary@oregonlive.com. Please include your email and phone number for verification. Each Oregon manufacturer faces a unique set of challenges. Many of their challenges are so industry-specific that government can't do much to help. That's why one-size-fits-all legislation rarely works, and why rules applying the same scheduling restrictions to all businesses could be crippling.   But manufacturers do need some basic things from government. They need a modern transportation system to get their products to markets near and far. They need workers, some with four-year college degrees and some with specialized vocational technical training. And they need to be able to expand when customers are demanding their products without waiting months or years to obtain necessary permits. Providing the type of business climate that allows manufacturers to succeed is an achievable goal – and it doesn't require building a wall or renegotiating international treaties. It just requires healthy collaboration among businesses and between business and government.   -- Patrick Reiten is chairman of the board of Associated Oregon Industries and president and chief executive officer of PacifiCorp Transmission.

Password Laptops & Notebooks Theyre completely portable, and they use less power and make less noise than desktop models. But what if you have questions ?   Thread Tools Display Modes Big 4K screen workstation  thin and light MSI WS72 revealed   (#1) windwithme Master Guru     Videocard: P55/DDR3-1600/8GB Processor: Intel Core i5-750 Mainboard: Memory: Soundcard: PSU: HX520W Big 4K screen workstation  thin and light MSI WS72 revealed - 09-17-2016, 07:24 | posts: 552 In the past, it was more common for workstations to position themselves among computers on the PC market. Their built-in graphics card could significantly enhance the level of work efficiency for 3D CAD or video editors. Combining these two working environments demands, nearly three years later companies started to produce their workstations as a brand product line. After all, all workstations position themselves as high-end products with the specifications required by the professional users who prepare a certain budget for this kind of product. Id like to share an overview of MSI WS72 6QJ. As you can see on the box, the logo is different from the Gaming Dragon logo as its light green and workstation highlights the product positioning. The large backpack also has the same logo. WS workstation series and the companys GS series share a high degree of similarity in appearance. They both belong to the slim design product series. Even though the screen size ranges from 15.6 to 17.3, small weight and thickness still deliver extraordinary performance. The dimensions are 418.5mm x 287mm x 19.9mm, the weight is found to be about 2,630 gram. Its lighter than GS72 (2.6 kg) and its thickness is below the one Intel 15-inch Ultrabooks specifications state (21 mm). WS72 is a great combination of both an Ultrabooks slim design and high-performance hardware. The backside of the backpack is made of very solid materials. The separator inside is also quite thick. In terms of overall creativity, some individuals may think that theres still space for improvement and that GS70 looks better. Improved texture and fashionable design would let people like it more. WS72 6QJ Included accessories: CD drivers, Quick Start Guide, Product Features Guide, Two years warranty, DELTA 150W power adapter, power cable, Mini DisplayPort adapter, MSI dedicated mouse. A-side is covered with black brushed metal with a car hood design. Probably due to the materials change, WS72s metal touch is obviously better than GS70s. The main design of GS72 from Gaming Series is the same as WS72; the new generation of materials and design are now being introduced. When the laptop is on and in use, the logo illuminates light green enhancing appearance of the texture. B-side is a 17.3-inch screen which is UHD 4K with a resolution of 3840x2160. It features a wide view IPS panel and supports 100% Adobe RGB color gamut which enhances the color accuracy. WebCam with fixed focus lens is FHD 1920X1080p and is capable of recording video at 30fps. The frame is made of matte plastic material. The thickness is within the common scope and seems to be thinner than WS60. As for the internal mechanism these high-end hardware designs are necessary, C and D parts need to have a certain volume to in order to achieve high performance. As a concept of big length and width in the machine, if the length X width dimensions let the frame area be narrowed then it will definitely improve the thickness. WS72 can be this thin and there are no other competitive models which have the same length x width dimensions but are larger in weight. Its therefore already considered to be a good level product. Most of the C-side is also covered with black brushed metal and is similar to A-side. The actual surface area and the body thickness are similar to Dell Alienware 17. The notebook is equipped with thin full-color Steelseries keyboard which is common for MSI high-end notebooks. The default color is blue. Using the software, users can choose the backlight color they want as well as display color mode. Individuals used to think that Steelseries had soft keys, however this time WS72 has improved the force feedback. In terms of high-end notebook market, WS72 has improved the feeling of typing on a keyboard quite a lot. The power button is in the top center and is illuminated with white during notebooks use. Its illuminated with orange or blue when dedicated or integrated graphics card is in use, respectively. The speakers are still by Dynaudio consisting of 2 channel- and 4 usual speakers. Four single speakers are located in the chassis area which is a more special location for the sound to come out. The following paragraph includes detailed comments regarding the sound. The grid above the keyboard is used for cooling, not for the audio. On the bottom left of the C-side there are 7 status indicators. The left are right buttons feel like scissors design. It will take some time to get used to the strength control. Line out \ Line in \ Headphone-out On the left side, from left to right: GPU cooling grid\ RJ45 Gigabit Ethernet \ HDMI \ Mini-DisplayPort X2 \ USB 3.1 X2 \ Line out \ Line in \ Headphone-out     windwithme View Public Profile Find all posts by windwithme     (#2) windwithme Master Guru     Videocard: P55/DDR3-1600/8GB Processor: Intel Core i5-750 Mainboard: Memory: Soundcard: PSU: HX520W 09-17-2016, 07:30 | posts: 552 On the right side, from left to right: USB3.0 X2 \ SD(XC/HC) \ DC power jack \ Kensington lock slot \ CPU cooling grid D-side also consists of metal-based materials. The number of pads supporting WS72s button is quite big. The three pads above boost and strengthen the cooling function. The dark purple pad nearby isolates the heat and avoids users contact with the hardware design. The hardware warranty is up to 3 years. The built-in battery cannot be dismantled. It holds 5000mAh and is capable of 55.5Wh. The screen can be opened up to about 140 degrees. In terms of its own applications, MSI has increased their number comparing to the past. Apart from some previously existed and revised software, there are now also new applications with other features. In the lower right corner you can find a quick settings app  SYSTEM CONTROL MANAGER. Similarly to a quick selection on a mobile device, you can do relatively rapid adjustments for some commonly used features. KLM is software designed for setting keyboard LED backlighting. There are 6 modes: Normal, Gaming, Breathing, Wave, Dual, Color, Audio. Nowadays many Gaming keyboards have such features which make the keyboards recognizable and change their exterior design. Below is the description of the listening experience. This part is quite subjective, other notebooks built-in speakers are taken as a benchmark. Adjusting the volume to the maximum is considered fairly loud, so there is no need to worry that the speakers will be too quiet. High frequency: The sound isnt too sharp. Good in deep details, the performance is above average. Middle frequency: Excellent overall clarity in details. The quality of human voice sound is one of the best among high-end models. Low frequency: the low frequency performance is good; bass doesnt sound too hoarse, even though medium frequency in a too large volume can easily overwhelm the low frequency. The sound quality of WS72 does not reprise of the original feed line, unlike other high-end gaming notebooks with a sense of surround sound or field-based sound Listening to music or songs brings a very good feeling, watching movies or playing games also carries very good performance. In the past, the sound performance of WS72 wasnt possible to see on a graph. Now the sound performance is even better than on most gaming models. True Color is also screen color calibration software. In the past, many laptops with non-IPS panels had unsatisfactory performance in color reproduction. But even in case of IPS-panels, there was still a room for improvement in color accuracy. MSI is among high-end laptops used by individuals and is brand with certain requirements for the screen colors. In the field of workstation or graphic design, color accuracy is the main condition. One of the modes is sRGB which provides the color correction with nearly 100% sRGB color gamut standard. In total, there are 6 modes: Gamer***65295;Anti-Blue***65295;sRGB***65295;100%AdobeRGB***65295;Off ice***65295;Movie. 100%AdobeRGB provides a function of a more detailed calibration which is even for helpful for professional graphics or image processing. Gamer and 100%AdobeRGB modes differ in details. MSI True Color has already adjusted the settings with adaptive colors. Of course, users can adjust the colors the way they want. Shortcut Manager is also exclusive keyboard software. It mainly allows to assign macro keys and to upload your own settings files. It supports setting shortcuts, text clips, 3 modes of quick start and also 4 features of key disabling function. The comparison of the right side of MSI WS72s screen during Designer mode and the left side of HP Zbook Studio G3s screen. When adjusting brightness, both screens look similar, but due to different tones brightness still looks a bit different. You can also see 4K vs 1080p difference in font details, especially if the difference is image size is big. The following are tests of the performance aspects. In this workstation, except for the common 6th Gen. Intel Core i7, there is also a Server-level version of CPU which uses Intel Xeon E3-1505M v5. The specs include: Intels latest Skylake architecture, with the base clock is 2.8 GHz, is quad-core and support HT technology, the latest 14 nm processor, TurboBoost automatic overclocking up to 3.7, CM236 chipset, SmartCache of up to 8MB and built-in GPU Intel HD Graphics P530. Hardware benchmark tests CINEBENCH R15 CPU => 664 cb CPU(Single Core) => 144 cb     windwithme View Public Profile Find all posts by windwithme   (#3) windwithme Master Guru     Videocard: P55/DDR3-1600/8GB Processor: Intel Core i5-750 Mainboard: Memory: Soundcard: PSU: HX520W 09-17-2016, 07:45 | posts: 552 FRYRENDER Running Time => 5m 06s x264 FHD Benchmark => 22.9 PCMARK8  3268 Intel Xeon E3-1505M v5 vs. Core i7 performance comparison The clock performance and SmartCache are higher than i7-6700HQ. Xeon CPU performance generally has a more stable high performance in consumers eyes. In addition, it can be equipped with ECC DRAM, which is a required option for workstations specifications. DRAM benchmark test DDR4 2132.2 CL15 15-15-36 2T AIDA64 Memory Read - 30154 MB/s Sandra Memory Bandwidth - 24576 MB/s Embedding DDR4 improves clock a lot. Moreover, the bandwidth also improves a lot, thanks to 6th Generation Skylake architecture. Xeon CPU can run with ECC DRAM, even though its bandwidth isnt much different from the usual DDR4-2133 has. However, stability performance is still the main characteristics of ECC, especially for drawing or work environment. I believe that stability is the first required item, because a system cannot be the reason for business losses due to its crash. As for GPU, WS72 is carrying nVidia Quadro M2000M professional-level graphics card. Its built-in with 4GB GDDR5. Even though not the highest-end graphics card, its thin shape already looks pretty good for WS72. If you a higher-end graphics card in the notebook, MSI has a thick-body WT72 which can be competent with GT72 version. Below are some testing software made specifically for 3D graphic design to refer to. SPECviewperf12 I saw in some discussions online that SPECviewpefr12 can support DX11. If comparing to 970M, the difference is relatively small. nVidia Quadro graphics card advertised that it has a double-precision floating point architecture. GeForce single precision has a better precision mechanism computing power. Therefore, nVidia Quadro is more suitable for professional more sophisticated computational design. TessMark => 24289 points Comparison with other two, workstation and gaming, notebooks HP HP Zbook Studio G3 with M1000M scores about 17655 points Dell Alienware 15 with GTX 970Mscores about 8834 points The information is misleading as its for the integrated GPU. Please, refer to GPU-Z M2000M for the actual information. FluidMark => 1598 points The software can correctly display the information about a dedicated M2000M graphics card. Since nVidia and AMD classify themselves into DirectX and OpenGL, they have their own area of expertise in 3D. Though above there arent many pages with benchmark tests, there could be 10-50 pages occupied with different examinations. Using M1000M and GTX 970M simultaneously for performance comparison it would be easier to analyze advantages. Remember how before we would compare a graphics card with a gaming card of the same-level chipset, the gaming card would only display single-digit fps in the testing software. In the regard, the gap was quite large. nVIDIA Quadro M2000M is also able to run such a 3D graphics software such as AutoCad. Certainly, some drawings are in 2D field. However, to use 3D graphics software, having 3D graphics card is a must. There might be quite many people interested in M2000Ms performance in general games. In fact, Im no exception. 3DMark11 => P5600 3DMARK => 3942 M2000Ms performance is similar to one gaming card of GTX 960M shows. To be able to run heave 3D-level games, its just necessary not to set the highest resolution. Then the main work should be carried out by workstation or selected gaming notebooks. So, the performance in gaming should also be on a good level.     windwithme View Public Profile Find all posts by windwithme   (#4) windwithme Master Guru     Videocard: P55/DDR3-1600/8GB Processor: Intel Core i5-750 Mainboard: Memory: Soundcard: PSU: HX520W 09-17-2016, 08:07 | posts: 552 WS72s drive C includes SAMSUNG MZVPV128HDGM 128GBX2 M.2 SSD The drive D is HGST HTS721010A9E630 which specs are 7200 RPM and 1 TB capacity for storing files Below is a benchmark test of 128GBX2 M.2 SSD Raid0 on the Drive C AS SSD Benchmark - 2448 Seq Read - 2752.91 MB/s Write - 1301.17 MB/s 4K - 64Thrd Read - 977.29 MB/s Write - 307.52MB/s CrystalDiskMark Seq Read - 3183MB/s Write - 1357MB/s ATTO DISK Benchmark, when exceeding 32k on the above test, can show the read speed equal to 3330Mb/s and the write speed equal to 1378MB/s WS72 includes MSI SUPER RAID4 technology which is when two M.2 SSD cards are run in Raid0 mode. With high-performance M.2 SSD you can boost the read/write performance speed while with SATA3 its hard to achieve such a bandwidth. Its said that the read speed can be as high as 3300MB/s. Its also certainly achievable according to ATTO. CrystalDiskMark also shows close number: 3200. MSI equipped with a conventional large-capacity HDD which is indeed good as it expands the storage space. If SSD price continues to decrease in the future, with the internal space of 512GB or higher it wont be really necessary to embed HDD. The notebook will then be even lighter. With room temperature about 32 degrees, proceeding to CPU cooling capacity test. The CPU being at a preset value of 2.8~3.7GHz, GPU running with Quadro M2000M, with power supply on the turbo mode. With Cooler Boost 3 used as a cooling technology, the systems idle temperature is about 39~42. AIDA64 System Stability Test - 81~89 WS72s outer shells temperature feels a bit higher than the notebooks made from other materials. This is because thermal conduction on metal body is more direct and more evident. With embedded 4C8T Architectures Xeon which is the same Core i7 CPUs, CPU temperature is only 42 degrees in standby mode thanks to outstanding cooling capacity. However, it doesnt exceed 90 degrees when CPU is running at its full speed, which is comparable with many thick-body notebooks thermal modules. In fact, WS72s cooling capacity is already at a high level. It involves up to 5 heat pipes to enhance heat dissipation. Also, the noise produced by the radiator can be considered to be partially muted. Moreover, at the low frequencies, the sound doesnt feel uncomfortable either. Battery life endurance, Windows 10 at a balanced power. After playing DVD video on WS72 for 90 minutes, the battery will be at about 50%. After 120 minutes, there will be about 33% power left. Maximum usage can be for around 3 hours. With such a high-end hardware, 4K resolution screen consumes more power then FHD. WS72s life endurance is therefore about average which is considered as a very good battery performance. Summary of WS72 6QJs advantages and disadvantages Pros of features and advantages: 1.Regarding the external ID design and the shell texture, the notebooks thickness and weight are truly outstanding. 2.Equipped Intel Xeon CPU and ECC DDR4 enhance stability which is workstations requirement. 3.4K high resolution IPS matte panel features 100% NTSC color gamut and 100% Adobe RGB color correction. 4.True color correction technology and a variety of adaptive modes provide more accurate colors. 5.After the evolution of SteelSeries keyboards, the keys force feedback feeling is of a high standard among notebooks. 6.Single speaker sound level brings clear audio experience to users. 7.High-speed 256GB M.2 SSD and 1TB HDD provide both performance and capacity. 8.3-year factory warranty is higher than usual gaming notebooks 2-year warranty. Cons for future improvements 1.Due to the thin metal body design, users in summer will feel that the laptops temperature is slightly higher. 2.Backpack looks like the one from Gaming series. 3.Although the front camera captures at a high level, theres still a room for quality improvement.

Its worth a credit since individuals used to use DELL or HP workstation. It terms of audio and keyboard, its still graded as a usual notebook, theres nothing particular to highlight. Of course, graphics card or Xeon CPU with ECC RAM are workstations all requirements. MSI also has an advantage in its panel calibration. The default colors are bright yet accurate. It provides a great help and comfort for working or designing which sounds very impressive to people at first glance. WS72 also has some lower-price versions with Core i7, common DDR4 and 1080P panel. If theres no demand for high-level hardware, then it also represents a good budget-based choice, even though 3D graphics machines are all in the high-end market. With every update MSI has been showing some progress or introducing new technology and of course there are some weaknesses or disadvantages. However, theres an obvious significant progress comparing to GS70 from the previous generation. This is a good and a positive cycle. In terms of visuals and audio, WS72 looks very competitive to windwithme. After all, a combination of gaming background and workstation make it an excellent notebook.

While the argument both for and against are equally valid, many of the top Wall Street strategists we cover feel that they want a few more months of data, and most importantly, regardless of who wins they want to get the presidential election behind us. The volatility in the markets has shaken some of the top dividend leaders and may be giving long-term investors a great buying opportunity. Many of the Wall Street firms we cover here at 24/7 Wall St. are becoming increasingly conservative and suggesting clients go to large cap names that pay solid dividends. We screened the Merrill Lynch research universe and found four that are rated Buy and pay a higher dividend than the 30-year U.S. Treasury, which currently yields a 2.4%. Helmerich & Payne This company primarily operates as a contract drilling company in South America, the Middle East and Africa. Helmerich & Payne Inc. (NYSE: HP) provides drilling rigs, equipment, personnel and camps on a contract basis to explore for and develop oil and gas from onshore areas and fixed platforms, tension-leg platforms and spars in offshore areas. Its contract drilling business operates through three reportable segments: U.S. Land, Offshore and International Land. The company posted second-quarter earnings that many felt came in much better than expected. At last report, the company’s U.S. Land rig segment, which is its largest business, had a utilization rate of 31%, compared to 68% this time last year. The International Land operations also saw utilization rates decline to 38%. What is slightly surprising, though, is that the average margin for a rig in use increased between this quarter and the same time last year. Many top Wall Street analysts feel that the company is one of the best positioned for the U.S. land recovery, and they also cite the strong balance sheet and the sector leading dividend. Helmerich & Payne investors receive a big 4.9% dividend. The Merrill Lynch price target for the stock is a whopping $72, and the consensus price objective is $59.68. Shares closed Tuesday at $57.18. Intel This leader in semiconductors is working hard to scale away from dependence on personal computers. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) designs, manufactures and sells integrated digital technology platforms worldwide. The company’s platforms are used in various computing applications comprising notebooks, two-in-one systems, desktops, servers, tablets, smartphones, wireless and wired connectivity products, wearables, retail devices and manufacturing devices, as well as for retail, transportation, industrial, buildings, home use and other market segments. The company also provides communication and connectivity offerings, such as baseband processors, radio frequency transceivers and power management integrated circuits, and tablet, phone and Internet of Things solutions, which include multimode 4G LTE modems, Bluetooth technology and GPS receivers, software solutions and interoperability tests, as well as home gateway and set-top box components. Intel reported an inline second quarter, but data center sales came in way below expectations. But a new partnership with Microsoft for a virtual reality, as well as a consistent shift away for reliance on chips for personal computers, keeps the stock a compelling buy. Intel investors receive a 2.92% dividend. Merrill Lynch has a $42 price target, while the consensus target is $37.90. The shares closed most recently at $35.61.

The ACLU, Human Rights Watch, and Amnesty International came together this week in a renewed initiative to get whistleblower Edward Snowden pardoned by the Obama administration before he leaves office in January. Conveniently, Snowden, the biopic directed Oliver Stone, opens this weekend and portrays Snowden in an extremely positive light. As you’ll see in our news roundup below, however, Congress is far from convinced. The New York Attorney General’s office announced that it’s cracking down on websites for kids that illegally track browsing. Meanwhile, the Justice Department is working to expand the scale and scope of law enforcement’s malware distribution and hacking. And it turns out that the FBI, despite its claims to the contrary, likely could have hacked one of the San Bernardino shooters’ iPhones without the cooperation it demanded from Apple. With an attack on the World Anti-Doping Agency, Russian hackers seemed to be getting even more more brazen than in their hack of the Democratic National Committee. In a long-awaited decision, a U.K. judge ruled that activist Lauri Love should be extradited to the U.S. to face hacking charges. And malicious third-party iOS app stores are distributing adware-laced Pokémon Go apps to millions of iPhones. (See more Pokémon Go-related malware below.) Oh, and it turns out that pixelating or blurring images to obscure the people and objects in them can be defeated by modern machine learning techniques. Not very comforting for all those unwilling guest stars on COPS. And there’s more: Each Saturday we round up the news stories that we didn’t break or cover in depth but still deserve your attention.

House Intel Committee Slams Snowden in Leak Investigation Report Three years after Edward Snowden walked out of the NSA with a trove of its secrets and flew to Hong Kong, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence has released the first glimpse of its investigation into the fallout. And how convenient that it arrived 24 hours before the opening weekend of Snowden, the Hollywood film directed by Oliver Stone that portrays the young whistleblower as a full-blown hero. “Edward Snowden is no hero – he’s a traitor who willfully betrayed his colleagues and his country,” committee chair Devin Nunes wrote in a statement accompanying the three-page report. It accuses Snowden of faking performance reviews, lying about breaking his legs in Army training, and copying 1.5 million documents, thus endangering national security. In his Twitter feed and via his lawyer, Snowden denied most of those points. He wrote that he hadn’t actually faked a performance review but instead reported a security vulnerability in the review system, and that he’d spent weeks convalescing for his leg injuries in an Army medical center before walking out on crutches. As for the 1.5 million documents, his ACLU lawyer, Ben Wizner, called the tally “nonsensical,” saying that the NSA had overestimated the number because it couldn’t determine how many files Snowden had copied. Justice Department OKs FBI’s Impersonation of AP Journalist In 2007, the FBI impersonated an Associated Press editor to communicate with a suspected source of a high school bomb threat, tricking him into opening an email attachment that planted malware on his computer and revealed the 15-year-old’s location. When the incident was disclosed by the Seattle Times seven years later, the AP and several newspapers protested the tactic, which could inhibit the press’ ability to do its work without suspicion. Now the Department of Justice’s Office of the Inspector General has released the results of its investigation into the incident and essentially declared the move kosher. “FBI policies did not prohibit the practice of agents impersonating journalists, nor was there any requirement that agents seek special approval to engage in such practice,” the report states. The AP responded that it’s “deeply disappointed” in the decision, which “compromises the ability of a free press to gather the news safely and effectively and raises serious constitutional concerns.” The FBI, for its part, has since changed its policy to prohibit impersonation of the news media. Swedish Court Preserves Arrest Warrant in Julian Assange Sexual Assault Case A Swedish appeals court upheld Julian Assange’s six-year-old arrest warrant, after he challenged it again. The WikiLeaks founder has spent more than three years living in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London because he claims that going to Sweden would put him at risk for being extradited to the U.S. on espionage charges related to classified information WikiLeaks has published. The arrest warrant is aimed at interrogating Assange; he hasn’t been formally indicted. The statute of limitations for the case is 10 years and will expire in 2020 if Swedish prosecutors don’t indict him by then, but they say that they are working to advance the case and Assange is scheduled to be interrogated by Ecuadorian officials on behalf of Swedish law enforcement in October. Hacker Breaches Science News Embargo Site EurekAlert! Last week a hacker compromised all the login credentials of the science news service EurekAlert!, which journalists and public information officers user to access new research papers in advance of their publication. A German journalist notified EurekAlert! of the breach after the hacker attempted to sell him login credentials for the site. The attacker also released two news releases ahead of their embargo dates. EurekAlert, which is a division of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, took its site off line, and it’s been down since Tuesday evening. The service says that it has “rebuilt the EurekAlert! system environment” and hopes to reinstate the site over the weekend. When it’s live again, the site says that all passwords will be reset. Criminals Snuck a Trojan Into the Google Play Store By Disguising it as a Pokémon Go Guide Kaspersky Lab recently notified Google that an app called “Guide For Pokémon Go” was actually a malicious Trojan lurking in its Play store. Users downloaded the app more than 500,000 times before the researchers caught it, and it infected at least 6,000 phones with malware. Once downloaded, the system appeared to offer real advice about Pokémon Go, but it also scanned its host device checking to see whether it was a private individual’s phone or a test unit used to detect malicious attacks. Only if the environment seemed safe did the Trojan begin downloading other malicious files. Kaspersky Lab found that, for now, the criminals running the attack use the Trojan to place adware on victims’ phones, but the researchers caution that the same system could easily be used to inject ransomware or other more damaging and intrusive malware. Google Offers $200,000 Bug Bounty for Best Android Attack Apple apparently raised the bar for bug bounties when in August it announced a $200,000 reward for any white-hat hacker who tells the company about a previously unknown full takeover technique for iOS devices. Now Google is matching that sum—for at least one lucky hacker. In a new contest it’s calling the Project Zero Prize, the company will pay out $200,000 to the hacker or team of hackers that submits the best sequence of vulnerabilities that can fully compromise an Android phone. (Modern hacking techniques typically require not a single bug, but many linked together to defeat all the protections of a device’s operating system.) The runner-up will receive $100,000, and other worthy entries will each receive $50,000. For now, only Nexus 6P and Nexus 5x phones are valid targets—after all, why bother digging up brilliant hackable vulnerabilities in the majority of other Android phones when their users don’t get patches for them?

The red team has made bold claims about its new card, saying that it’s the best 1440p and VR-ready card for around £200. The RX 480’s new architecture and lower price see it charge headlong into one of computing’s busiest battlefields - and, in particular, up against Nvidia’s older GTX 970. New hardware has caused that card to drop in price, which means it’s now a key challenger for AMD’s card. Is it worth shelling out for the new Radeon, or can Nvidia’s classic GTX 970 hold its own? If you want to read our individual reviews, you can click here for the RX 480 and the GTX 970. Related: Best graphics cards in 2016 Nvidia GeForce GTX 970 v AMD Radeon RX 480 – Specs and technology AMD has made the unusual decision to debut its Polaris architecture with this mid-range card. There’s a lot to like about the fourth iteration of the Graphics Core Next system, not least the move from a 28nm to a 14nm manufacturing process. That’s a bigger leap than Nvidia has taken with its new 16nm Pascal cards, and it means that AMD can cram even more transistors into the same area without increasing heat and power consumption. The RX 480 remains a mid-range card, so expectations should be managed. It has a reasonable 2,304 stream processors divided into 36 Compute Units for more granular task delegation, and its core sits at stock and boost speeds of 1,120MHz and 1,266MHz. Video: AMD Radeon RX 480 review AMD’s card has some software features that have also been introduced on Nvidia’s new hardware, like better asynchronous computing. That’ll help when managing CPU and GPU workloads in games with DirectX 12, but it’s not a feature that’ll be coming to the GTX 970. AMD is building the RX 480 in two versions – one with 4GB of GDDR5 memory, and one with 8GB. The 8GB card will have faster memory, too, with throughput of 8Gbps compared to 7Gbps from the lesser card. Prices fluctuate pretty rapidly, which is why the GTX 970 is such a close competitor to the RX 480. The Radeon’s specification compares well to Nvidia’s older card. The GTX 970 uses the older 28nm manufacturing process, which means it has half a billion fewer transistors than its rival, and it only has 1,664 stream processors. Its stock and boost clocks sit at 1,050MHz and 1,250MHz, and it has just one memory configuration: 4GB of GDDR5. Related: Best gaming PC specs to build yourself The GTX 970’s lesser specification means it provides a throughput rating of 3.4TFLOPS – far less than the 5.8TFLOPS of the AMD card. There’s little between their power consumption ratings, despite that: the RX 480’s 150W power demand is only five Watts higher than the GTX 970. It doesn’t sound like much of a contest on paper, but the benchmarks reveal a far closer fight than I expected. Nvidia GeForce GTX 970 v AMD Radeon RX 480 – Testing Methodology I benchmarked the GTX 970 and RX 480 on TrustedReviews’ test rig, which has been designed to match the specifications of a standard enthusiast gaming PC. It features the following components: Motherboard: Asus Z170-Deluxe Processor: Intel Core i5-6600K (not overclocked) RAM: Corsair Vengeance 2666MHz, 16GB DDR4 Cooler: Corsair H60 liquid cooler PSU: Corsair CX750M SSD: Samsung 850 EVO OS: Windows 10 Pro 64-bit Nvidia GeForce GTX 970 v AMD Radeon RX 480 – Performance I’ve tested these powerful cards with five games. Each title is run at its highest settings, and I’ve tested each game at 1,920 x 1,080, 2,560 x 1,440 and 3,840 x 2,160 – 4K. I’ve also used a selection of synthetic benchmarks, with 3D Mark’s demanding Fire Strike test alongside benchmarks to measure power consumption and peak temperature. DIRT Rally Ultra at 1,920 x 1,080 average  GTX 970: 97.3  RX 480: 88.9 Ultra at 2,560 x 1,440, average  GTX 970: 65.4  RX 480: 61.6 Ultra at 3,840 x 2,160, average  GTX 970: 34.4  RX 480: 34.7 This is the easiest game in this testing setup, with plenty of fast-paced textures but less intensive workloads in other departments. It’s no surprise that both cards blitzed this rally racer at 1080p: the RX 480 averaged 88.9fps, while the Nvidia card was about nine frames faster. That means the GTX 970 had an 8.63% lead, but the gap closed to 5.81% at 1440p – perhaps because the RX 480 is flexing its extra transistors and memory. Both cards beat the magical 60fps figure, with the Nvidia silicon almost four frames ahead. Both cards also managed to beat 30fps at 4K, which isn’t too surprising considering that this is a less intensive game. I was surprised when the AMD hardware took a slim lead: its 34.7fps average is 0.3fps ahead of the Nvidia card. That’s good, but don’t expect either of these GPUs to handle 4K gaming. Those 34fps averages will be undermined by sluggish minimum framerates, especially when the on-screen action becomes more frantic. Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor Ultra at 1,920 x 1,080 average  GTX 970: 85.4  RX 480: 83.6 Ultra at 2,560 x 1,440, average  GTX 970: 55.9 RX 480: 57.2 Ultra at 3,840 x 2,160, average  GTX 970: 37.7  RX 480: 39.3 This game is full of particle and fire effects, which can make it a little tricky for some GPUs, especially considering I run this test at Ultra settings. Nvidia’s card continued its 1080p lead with an average framerate of 85.4fps, but its advantage was a slim 2fps – and it was overturned when I turned the resolution up to 2,560 x 1,440. With the larger number of pixels deployed the RX 480 averaged 57.2fps, which was more than a frame faster than the Nvidia card. Both of these GPUs managed to run the benchmark at 4K, too. The RX 480 maintained its slim advantage with an average of 39.3fps. Hitman Max Settings at 1,920 x 1,080, average  GTX 970: 59  RX 480: 69.7 Max Settings at 2,560 x 1,440, average  GTX 970: 45.4  RX 480: 54.3 Max Settings at 3,840 x 2,160, average  GTX 970: 25.08  RX 480: 30.6 Hitman is a game designed with AMD in mind, so the results here aren't surprising. It’s a competitive set of results for a title that’s among the toughest benchmarks around thanks to its reliance on high-end lighting and particle effects. Its Full HD average of 69.7fps was ten frames better than the GTX 970 and on the right side of the crucial 60fps barrier, and it was nine frames quicker than its rival at 1440p. The Radeon’s average of 54.3fps will ensure smooth gameplay at this higher resolution. The RX 480 maintained a good lead at 4K, too. Its average of 30.6fps is five frames better than the GTX 970 and it does break the important 30fps barrier, but don’t assume that it’ll play Hitman smoothly at 4K without compromising on several of the graphics options. Rise of the Tomb Raider Max Settings at 1,920 x 1,080 average  GTX 970: 60  RX 480: 63.5 Max Settings at 2,560 x 1,440, average  GTX 970: 36.7  RX 480: 44.2 Max Settings at 3,840 x 2,160, average  GTX 970: 19.9 RX 480: 27.3 Tomb Raider strains graphics cards with trickier weather and lighting effects than most other titles on the market. This is also the only game where the RX 480 led the way at every resolution and opened up a wider lead over the GTX 970 as I increased the pixel count. Its 63.46fps average at 1080p was just over three frames quicker than the GTX 970, and the Radeon then scored 44.2fps at 1440p – far better than the 36.7fps over the Nvidia card. That’s a gap of 5.77% improving to a gap of 20.44%. The Radeon averaged 27.33fps at 4K. That means the game isn’t playable at its maximum settings at 3,840 x 2,160, but it was a whopping 37.61% faster than the GTX 970 in the same test. Synthetic Benchmarks, Power and Heat 3D Mark Fire Strike Ultra  GTX 970: 2767  RX 480: 2638 Peak power:  GTX 970: 260W  RX 480: 249W Peak temperature:  GTX 970: 73  RX 480: 70 There’s very little to choose between these two cards in the synthetic 3D Mark Fire Strike test. The GTX 970 leads the way with a score of 2,767 points, but the RX 480 is barely behind thanks to its result of 2,638 points. That supports my conclusions from real-world tests: the GTX 970 might be better in lower resolutions and easier games, but the RX 480 is a more efficient architecture and deploys its power with more aplomb – therefore it takes key victories in tougher tests. AMD’s shrunken architecture consumed less power than its rival, too. The test rig drew 249W from the mains with the Radeon installed, which is 11W less than the Nvidia-powered machine required. And, finally, it’s cooler – albeit only by three degrees. The Radeon’s top temperature of 70°C is an excellent result, and it means there’s no need to fret about overheating. Performance Conclusions There’s a clear trend to be seen across most of my test games: if a game is a tougher benchmark, the RX 480 tends to outperform its older rival. That’s clear evidence of the newer architecture, increased memory throughput and shrunken manufacturing process paying dividends. It’s a victory for the RX 480 in most of the important tests, then, but don’t go thinking that AMD’s cut-price card will handle 4K gaming smoothly. This is a GPU designed for Full HD and 1440p gaming, and in those department it’s stop on – but any higher resolutions will cause it to struggle. The RX 480 consistently beats its rival while consuming less power: its peak draw of 249W is eleven fewer than the same machine with the GTX 970 installed. Buy Now: GTX 970 at Amazon.com from $259 Best Deals for Nvidia GeForce GTX 970 Other Things to Consider My testing looked at an EVGA-overclocked GTX 970 and a reference RX 480. In other words, this is one of the best GTX 970s around versus an early RX 480 that’ll surely improve over time with third-party manufacturers pre-overclocking it and adding beefy cooling systems. This means that the narrow lead the GTX 970 shows in any of the above benchmarks will likely be diminished by more powerful RX 480s. Buy Now: AMD Radeon RX 480 at Amazon.com from $199.99 Best Deals for AMD Radeon RX 480 Verdict The RX 480 delivers excellent Full HD and 1440p performance for a surprisingly low price – and its consistent leads in tougher tests bode well for the future and indicate that AMD’s new hardware is doing its job. The GTX 970 is similarly quick at those resolutions and is a tad cheaper, but it doesn’t have the new architecture, the extra memory or the software improvements – as you'd expect for an older card, of course. If they drop in price even further, they’re still an excellent buy. In this comparison, the RX 480 takes a clear win in the 1440p stakes. But, of course, there are external factors to consider as well. The Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 has arrived on the scene in both 3GB and 6GB guises. We haven't tested the GTX 1060 in 3GB form, but we have full benchmarks of the 6GB version, which show it's a worthy 1440p card.

The TSMC finFET Pascal 1060 is the one to buy for low budget gamer, but you would be much better off saving for a 1070. luke September 19, 2016, 3:57 pm AMD RX480 is selling like hot cakes, as it should - Its a great GPU as is the lesser RX470 Tyrann September 19, 2016, 7:47 pm Weird comparison at this time when you should be comparing RX480 to GTX1060. GTX970's are being phased out so people shouldn't be looking to get those. Also either card won't be able to handle 1440p ultra 60fps. vlx September 19, 2016, 10:53 pm lolwut the gtx 970 beat the rx 480 in dirt rally even though its amd optimized Domaldel September 22, 2016, 9:37 pm Well, there's still the used market. People looking to upgrade to a 1070 or 1080 from a 970 might drive prices down quite a bit and the performance is comparable. The 1060 is more comparable with the 980 in performance and most of them is also more expensive then most of the 480s in most locations, although there are of course exceptions.

Hayley Platt reports ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript They were once dismissed by the makers of luxury Swiss watches as a gadget that won't last. Now some of the biggest names in the sector are getting into the smartwatch market. Last year Tag Heuer teamed up with Google and Intel to produce its own 'connected' device. The first 15,000 sold out fast. This year it's increased the numbers to 50,000. SOUNDBITE (English) TAG HEUER, CEO, JEAN-CLAUDE BIVER, SAYING: "The connected watch is an incredible asset for TAG Heurer. It has regenerated the brand, it has given the brand a new dynamic. It has linked the brand to the future. It has linked the brand to the new generation." Shipments of smartwatches reportedly overtook traditional ones in the last quarter of 2015. Almost all the main export markets for trademark luxury timepieces fell. The U.S by just a little And Japan by almost 2 percent But it was China that suffered the most Only exports to Italy were higher than the previous year (SOUNDBITE) (English): COMMERZBANK, GLOBAL FINANCIAL ECONOMIST, PETER DIXON, SAYING "Obviously sanctions on places like Russia haven't helped. The Chinese slowdown and the backlash against corruption which appears to be going on domestically have also taken the edge off the market and of course the Swiss have been hampered by a very sharp rise in the franc." It was still mainly traditional watches on display at an industry fair in Basel this week. But no-one wants to be late to the smartphone party - and who can blame them. One research group estimates the market will be worth $117 billion by 2020.

Investors continue to remain on edge regarding the possibility of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates at its meeting next week. Banks also fell, led by a plunge in Deutsche Bank after the giant German lender said it wouldn’t settle with the Department of Justice over its handling of mortgage securities in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 88.68 points, or 0.5 percent, to 18,123.80. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index fell 8.10 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,139.16 and the Nasdaq composite fell 5.12 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,244.57. The U.S.-listed shares of Deutsche Bank dropped $1.38, or 9 percent, to $13.38 after the bank said it did not intend to pay the $14 billion settlement that the U.S. government asked for. Federal regulators have been looking to settle with Deutsche Bank, as it has done with the other major Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase & Co., for its role in the mortgage bubble and financial crisis. Other European banks fell as well. Royal Bank of Scotland Group fell 30 cents, or 6 percent, to $4.86. The news out of Deutsche Bank dragged European stocks lower, with Germany’s DAX closing down 1.5 percent, France’s CAC-40 index down 0.9 percent and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 index down 0.3 percent. Stocks have been volatile this week, with the Dow moving more than 100 points four out of five days. Most of the volatility has come as investors prepare for next week’s Fed meeting. While most investors do not expect a rate increase, there is a small but noticeable likelihood there will be one. In other company news, pharmaceutical company Novavax plunged $7.05, or 85 percent, to $1.29 after the company said its experimental vaccine failed in late-stage clinical testing. Novavax has no active products on the market and this drug was their furthest in development. Intel rose $1.11, or 3 percent, to $37.67 after the company raised its revenue forecasts, citing stronger-than-expected demand for personal computers. The S&P 500 is adding a new industry to its traditional groups for the first time since the dotcom era. The benchmark stock index will now have a real estate sector, which will be split off from the financial services component. The new industry component will be effective at the end of trading Friday. After the split, the S&P 500 will have 11 industry sectors. The 10 current sectors of the S&P 500 are: financial services, information technology, energy, industrials, consumer discretionary companies, materials, telecommunications, consumer staples, health care and utilities. Benchmark U.S. crude lost 88 cents to $43.03 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, fell 82 cents to $45.77 per barrel. Heating oil fell 1 cent to $1.41 a gallon, wholesale gasoline rose 3 cents to $1.46 a gallon and natural gas rose 2 cents to $2.948 per 1,000 cubic feet. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was mostly unchanged at 1.69 percent. The euro fell to $1.1151 from $1.246 and the dollar rose to 102.42 yen from 102.16 yen. In metals, gold fell $7.80 to $1,310.20 an ounce, silver fell 18 cents to $18.86 an ounce and copper was unchanged at $2.16 a pound. & Filed under: Dow Jones, S&P, Stocks Print Email Gmail Related Stocks Slide, Led by Declines in the Energy Sector and Banks Another Gain for U.S. Stocks, Led By Banks and Tech Companies  Winning Streak for Stocks Ends As Banks and Miners Slump U.S. Stocks Take Biggest Loss In Six Weeks, Led By Banks  Stocks Rise to Wrap Up a Strong Week as Banks Move Higher Subscribe to the Hamodia print edition More in Business U.S. Stocks Slip as Health Care and Technology Take Losses Volkswagen to Shed 30,000 Jobs, Cutting Costs After Scandal Asian Shares Mixed, Nikkei Up as Yellen Remarks Lift Dollar Business Briefs – November 17, 2016 Bank Stocks Surge Again, Leading Broader Market Higher OP-ED On Seeking Counsel Hillary Clinton Wasn’t The Only Big Election Loser A Common Sense Regulation Where Do We Go From Here?

X Seen & Heard: Larry Goodman poised to increase Blackrock Clinic stake Donie Cassidy sells houses to Dalata hotels, while 500 homes could be built on RTÉ site Sun, Sep 18, 2016, 18:04 Surgeon Jimmy Sheehan is set to sell his stake in the Blackrock Clinic in Dublin to beef baron Larry Goodman for €16 million. Photograph: Cyril Byrne         SUNDAY BUSINESS POST Surgeon Jimmy Sheehan is set to sell his stake in the Blackrock Clinic in Dublin to beef baron Larry Goodman for €16 million, the Sunday Business Post reports. While the report doesn’t give Mr Sheehan’s stake, he was known to have an almost 14 per cent holding after UK health insurer Bupa sold its controlling stake in Blackrock Clinic in 2006. Mr Goodman, who bought a 28 per cent holding in the company in 2005, also agreed to buy out Mr Sheehan’s holding in the Galway Clinic last month for €31 million, which would increase his stake to 75 per cent, according to the report. SUNDAY TIMES Former Fianna Fail TD and senator Donie Cassidy is selling three Georgian buildings in Dublin’s city centre to Dalata, the country’s biggest hotel group, according to the Sunday Times. Dalata, headed by chief executive Pat McCann, plans to expand its existing Maldron hotel on Parnell Square into the adjoining three buildings at Granby Row, which Mr Cassidy owns with his wife, Anne. They are currently arranged in apartments. The Sunday Times also reports that Green Reit has cut €1.5 million off its annual interest costs by negotiating a 2 per cent interest rate on a €150 million loan from Bank of Ireland. Green Reit had previously paid an annual 3 per cent rate on the facility, which the group arranged this year to have extended to last until June 2021 from May 2018, according to the property company’s annual report. SUNDAY INDEPENDENT Intel, the US computer chipmaking giant, has highlighted the dearth of affordable housing in Ireland at Government level, according to the Sunday Independent. The company, which cut hundreds of jobs in Ireland in recent months as part of a global drive to cut 12,000 positions, touched on the issue when Intel Ireland general manager Eamonn Sinnott met Derek Moran, secretary general of the Department of Finance, in May, the newspaper said. Brexit and tax were also discussed at the meeting, it said. ADVERTISEMENT The Sunday Independent also reports that RTÉ estimates that as many as 500 homes could be developed on its Donnybrook site in Dublin 4. The scope of the potential seen by RTÉ was contained in a masterplan submitted to Dublin City Council for the 10-acre site on part of the Donnybrook campus, which has been earmarked for development by the broadcaster. The site could achieve €50 million for RTÉ if sold, the newspaper said.       Topics: Derek Moran Donie Cassidy Eamonn Sinnott Jimmy Sheehan Larry Goodman Pat Mccann Department of Finance Dublin City Council Fianna Fáil RTÉ Blackrock Clinic Intel Ireland Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Energy & Resources Draghi warns against allowing Central Bank to cap mortgage rates Economy John FitzGerald: Long way to go in fight against climate change Politics Pat Hickey to deposit €410,000 bond needed to regain passport International Rory Best: We need our best performance ever Sponsored Designing the F-Pace: the story of Jaguar's best-seller HR managers need a simplified approach to pensions World-first tech restores mains electricity to Aran Islands Newbridge Silverware builds ambitious plan for US market ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest Business Airbnb takes on tourism industry with move into excursions 17:10 Three UK hit by data breach but no risk to Irish customers 16:28 Abercrombie & Fitch shares slide as sales miss estimates 15:52 Draghi warns against allowing Central Bank to cap mortgage rates 15:50 Germany says Commission has no right to decide on its fiscal space 15:39 ADVERTISEMENT Most Read in Business 1 Ireland’s biggest landlord: ‘I feel bad for the Irish people’ 2 Public sector pay rises?

I upgraded power supply when I got two RX480s and put them in xfire thinking maybe that would help, but that is stupid, power supply should not affect ram speed, stability yes. well in theory. still did not fix the issue... I bought a new mobo, ASRock Z77 Extreme4 Since this is the only mobo to support my i7 3770 as they are hard to find on the market, and it upgraded me to a 8x8x 3.0 xfire which I had a 16x 3.0 and 4x 2.0 before. Still new mobo did not fix the issue.... Everyone and every forum said I HAD to use a i7 3770K edition, in order for my ram to run DDR3 2400. I tried loosening the timing to max, max voltage, changing the BCLK ratio and multiplier. NOTHING would work... New mobo, psu, money down the drain... ONLY other option i had was I had another i7 3770 pc just sitting in the corner from a DELL pc I was given for free a few years ago... So I took the CPU out of that DELL computer put it in mine.... Low and behold the PC booted up to BIOS with no issue, did not even clear cmos, even though I should have. Set ram to DDR3-2400 and rebooted, CAME RIGHT UP! windows 7 did BSOD on me when trying to log into windows. So I decided to reformat and put windows 10 enterprise on. installed drivers from ASRock site, installed AMD 16.9.1 drivers Installed 3DMark, Fire Strike, Sky Diver, Time Spy, Battlefield 4 all play with no BSOD or crashes since. Turns out it was just a bad IMC on the i7 3770, I put another i7 3770 non k same version, and the ram is running at proper speeds. i7 3770-4.1GHz @ 1.225v XFX RX480 XXX 8GB @ 1288/2000 ASUS RX480 Ref 8GB @ 1288/2000 Corsair DDR3 2400 11-13-13-31 1T @ 1.655v Corsair Force GT 120GB SSD-BOOT Samsung 850 Pro 2x128GB SSD RAID0-Gaming Intel DC3510 Enterprise 3x480GB SSD-DATA Creative X-Fi Fata1ity ExtremeGamer 5.1 surround 6x24" Dell P2412H Monitors Corsair AX860 PSU Corsair 760T Case All is well, just hope this might help others that may have issue trying to run 2400 ram speeds. YOU DO NOT NEED A ( K ) version of i7 3770 to get DDR3 2400 speeds, your IMC in that CPU just may not be as good, you could get same result and not 2400 speeds with a K version!

From an elevated command prompt, try typing: winsat mem and seeing the reading. It's very much not a true benchmark, just a guide only. Windows 10 still includes winsat, even the latest RS2 insider. I only suggest you try running it as your score should be similar to mine.

Clear CMOS(the best way by jumper.More better- short the jumper,take off the battery and push power button, without power cord in PC rig)Give it ~5 min for sure. Then will go to BIOS and try all settings default.Check it. If not - will try manual sets. Check all power save settings for CPU.(i got troubles on my AMD mobo "enhance halt state(C1E)" settings on bsod issue.Don't know Intel settings well. And of course, check for BIOS firmware first. My opinion is non compatable memory modules with your mobo.     elaganza View Public Profile Find all posts by elaganza     (#5) taDkooF Newbie     Videocard: 2xRX480 16GB Xfire Processor: i7 3770 @4.1GHz-1.225v Mainboard: ASRock Z77 Extreme4 Memory: CMY16GX3M2A2400C11 Soundcard: Creative X-Fi Fata1ity5.1 PSU: Corsair AX860 Platinum 09-18-2016, 11:41 | posts: 13 | Location: Arizona, United States You did not read the post did you? I fixed the issue, it was not memory compatibility with the mobo, I used two different z77 high end mother boards and the memory would not run at 2400. ASRock clearing cmos is easy they put a button in, no jumpers anymore that is old school It was a bad IMC on the cpu, I put in a backup CPU I had which was exact cpu i was replaced. Just turns out that CPU could not handle it.     taDkooF View Public Profile Find all posts by taDkooF   (#6) Undying Ancient Guru     Videocard: R9 280X @ 1170/1500 Processor: Intel i5 @ 4.8Ghz 1.38v Mainboard: GA-Z68XP-UD3P Memory: HyperX-16GB @ 2133Mhz Soundcard: Onboard PSU: Tt Toughpower 775W 09-18-2016, 12:07 | posts: 8,649 | Location: Serbia, NS That can happen.

I agree it seems it should be higher, but when I run sisoft sandra memory benchmarks it says I score 91% so I can live with that, since I am not being forced to use 2200 anymore and atleast getting what I paid for in theory I guess. main reason I do not want to upgrade is because my CoolIT Vantage ALC with LCD screen only fits lga775, 1155-56, 1366 sockets. I do not want to lose it and 3770 is able to keep up with rx480 xfire so no need to upgrade yet. Intel processors with 40 PCIe lanes are 600$... no thanks and mobo with 16x16x 3.0 is another 200-300$ not worth the upgrade. when my coolit vantage alc cooler dies, ill upgrade to a 16x16x 3.0 and cpu with 40 pcie lanes. Actually.... Does a 115x cooler fit all 115x sockets, i know you can use 1155 and 1156 but will my lga 1155-56 fit a 1150?

Plus I can only get to 4.1GHZ on my non K 3770 which is still nice and I do not get lag from the boost. if I s tart to notice any stuttering in Xfire I run the CPU at stock clocks with no boost or turbo or multiplier and run at 34 instead of 41 things like that stuff etc... that always fixes Xfire micro stutter issues if anyone is curious. Turn off CPU overclock if running xfire if you have any stutter usually fixes it. Thank you to all those that have commented I really appreciated your feedback and conversation.

The report style does show all the memory results, so I've cropped them out and attached them. That also shows why I think getting DDR4-2133 for Skylake is not a good idea, it's slower than what I get on DDR3. If that same system was running the 'optimal' low CAS and other latencies DDR4-3200 no doubt it would smash my score.

Setting this too high will result in instability, so don't go crazy with it .

Since HP tech.support cannot help me further, i thought to write here. Basically what happens, not all the times but most of them, its that the GPU gets stuck to lowest clocks possible and it doesnt go up to 3D clocks, no matter what i try. So what i did to try to "fix" the problem is: - Reinstall from zero Windows 10 - Roll back drivers from windows - Using Windows Update Drivers - Using drivers from HP Support Assistant - Using DDU, perform a clean in safe mode, reinstall drivers - Update to latest drivers using GeForce Experience - Use ThrottleStop to keep CPU up to exclude thermal throttling - Manually set "prefer maximum performance" and force every possible game to run manually on the Discrete Gpu - Set manually clocks of 2d and 3d states to stock clock speed - Disable the dGPU, reboot, reenable it in windows and try again Windows 10 is completely up to date, as well all other drivers in it (intel gpu as well). So to partially fix this (and it doesnt work all the times) i need to unistall the drivers, reinstall them and reboot. Sometimes, let's say 7 on 10, it works. GPU starts working again. But most of the times, it doesn't. So i'm at loss here; the laptop supports win10 officially as the drivers pack have been uploaded to the laptop page, so that shouldn't be an issue. This is a screenshot of both CPUZ and GPUZ: http://imgur.com/a/Sdr9Y I'm clueless, WHEN IT WORKS, i can get the most out of it, it still holds up pretty fairly and i can game for the whole day. Disabling or hybernating the laptop doesn't help, neither an hard reset or cold boot. Thank you all, i'm open to any suggestion. PS: yes i tried to google and fixes etc are for win7 or 8, most of them are pretty dated. Also most of them advise what i've already tried. If anyone had an experience like this, let me know. I heard that a particular driver works fine for this kind of chipset but i got no source for that.     KingpinZero View Public Profile Find all posts by KingpinZero     (#2) Minotaur Member Guru   Videocard: Gainward 780 GLH 3G Processor: 4770k i7 @4.4 Mainboard: Gigabyte Z87X OC Memory: 16G 2400 Soundcard: Asus Xonar PSU: Corsair 750 09-18-2016, 12:29 | posts: 47 | Location: Sydney How's driver 269.09 behave?

Perhaps you need to tweak your Optimus settings to use your Nvidia card in games. If you don't have them, then you'll need to install the mobile driver instead. Also make sure that your active power plan is set to High Performance and that no Nvidia power saving options are set in your active power plan.

While Nvidia has higher usage but stuck clocks. Optimus settings? What i did was to select nvidia gpu ad preferred for those games, max performance, and also disabled the batteryboost option in geforce experience.

What I'm recently working on is a feature to load data blocks from NVMe-SSD to GPU using peer-to-peer DMA. It allows to bypass the CPU/RAM under a series of data loading process, thus, also allows to reduce number of expensive data copy. Once data blocks are loaded onto the GPU's RAM, we can process individual records within the blocks, by thousands processor cores, according to the GPU binary which shall be generated based on SQL query. Here is my longstanding project; PG-Strom that is an extension of PostgreSQL to off-load multiple SQL workloads on GPU devices, transparently. It has been developed for four years, and now supports simple scan, tables join, aggregation and projection. Its prime focus is CPU intensive workloads, on the other hands, it didn't touch storage subsystem of PostgreSQL because the earlier version of PG-Strom assumes all the data set shall be pre-loaded onto physical memory. No need to say, we had a problem when we want to process a data-set larger than physical RAM. One my solution is a feature enhancement to support data loading using SSD-to-GPU Direct DMA. Please assume a use case of a large table scan when its WHERE clause filters out 90% of rows. Usually, DBMS once loads entire data blocks from the storage to RAM, then evaluate individual records according to the WHERE clause. However, this simple but massive calculation is a job GPU can process much more efficiently, and can eliminate 90% of the data prior to loading onto CPU/RAM. It also enables to keep much more valuable data rather than cache out by junk data. Once we could load data blocks to GPU prior to CPU, we already have a feature to run tables join and (partial) aggregation on GPU. From the standpoint of CPU, it looks like the storage system gets an intelligence to run a part of SQL workloads, because row-filtering, tables join and aggregation are already done when data stream is arrived at CPU in respond to its i/o requests. A few days before, the initial version of SSD-to-GPU Direct DMA driver gets working. So, I tried to measure its throughput to load data blocks from a test file to GPU RAM. The result was remarkable. The "NVMe-Strom" is a record of SSD-to-GPU Direct DMA. Its throughput to load data blocks onto GPU device exceeds about 2200MB/s; which is catalog spec of Intel SSD 750(400GB). It is also twice faster than a pair of usual read(2) and cuMemcpyHtoDAsync; that it a CUDA API to kick asynchronous RAM-to-GPU DMA. When i/o size is smaller, its system-call invocation cost drives down the throughput furthermore. CPU: Intel Xeon E5-2670 v3 (12C, 2.3GHz) GPU: NVIDIA Tesla K20c (2496C, 706MHz) RAM: 64GB OS: CentOS 7 (kernel: 3.10.0-327.18.2.el7.x86_64) FS: Ext4 (bs=4096) In addition, I tried to measure the performance of a few SQL queries: A large table scan with simple WHERE clause A large table scan with complicated WHERE clause A large table scan with LIKE clause The tables size is about 64GB, contains 700million rows. The result is quite interesting. *1 The result of "PG-Strom" (red) shows the performance of GPU acceleration based on the existing storage system of PostgreSQL. It implies the throughput is dominated by i/o, thus unavailable to complete tables scan less than 140sec. It is valuable when WHERE clause takes complicated expression, but less advantage in other cases. On the other hands, "PG-Strom + NVMe-Strom" (blue) broke this limitation. In case of simple query, it scans the 64GB table by 42.67sec, thus, its processing throughput is 1535MB/s. We can expect PG-Strom is more valuable for more CPU intensive workloads, like JOIN or GROUP BY, rather than simple tables scan. I expect the pair of PG-Strom and NVMe-Strom will accelerate this kind of workloads going beyond the existing i/o boundary.

Even though some of its chips are a bit long in the tooth, gamers in particular can leverage them for a powerful machine without breaking the bank. Unfortunately, its AM3+ platform is lacking in some modern technology, such as DDR4 and PCIe 3.0. While DDR3 RAM is arguably still good enough, PCIe 2.0 is a bottleneck for modern NVMe SSDs. Luckily, consumers won't have to wait long to get a desktop PC powered by AMD's latest 7th generation APU -- codenamed 'Bristol Ridge'. Windows 10 OEMs (Lenovo and HP only, for now) are finally shipping these AM4 machines, which feature DDR4 memory, PCIe 3.0, and more. Of course, as APUs, the systems will have solid graphic performance without the need for a dedicated graphics card. This paves the way for the even more-powerful Zen CPUs from AMD. "Systems powered by 7th Generation AMD A-Series processors are productive, immersive, and energy efficient, with up to four 'Excavator' CPU cores. 7th Generation AMD A-Series desktop processors consist of 65-watt and 35-watt versions1, offering superior power efficiency and enabling flexible solutions in a wide variety of form factors. The new 7th Generation 65-watt A-Series processors deliver performance only realized at 95-watts with the previous generation. In addition, when compared to the Intel Core i5 6500, the new 65-watt processors offer up to equivalent productivity performance and up to 99 percent higher graphics performance", says AMD. Kevin Lensing, Corporate VP and general manager of Client Computing at AMD explains, "the consumer release of these new HP and Lenovo designs is an important milestone for AMD on two fronts. First, it marks a major increase in productivity performance, streaming video and eSports gaming experiences sought after by today's consumers, delivered through our new 7th Generation AMD A-Series desktop processors. Second, because these new OEM designs also feature our new AM4 desktop platform, the motherboard ecosystem shows its readiness for our upcoming high-performance 'Summit Ridge' desktop CPUs featuring 'Zen' cores, which share the same platform". While pricing and design is unknown, these machines should start appearing at retailers soon. Keep in mind, even though the processor is an APU with integrated graphics, you do have an upgrade path with the likely PCIe 3.0 x16 slot. In other words, an APU is a great way to save money up front while keeping your options open. While some Intel core processors feature integrated graphics too, they are nowhere near the performance of a top AMD APU. Are you excited to see PCs with 7th gen AMD APUs and AM4?

While many people feel that there is no such thing as too much choice, I respectfully disagree. Quite frankly, the Linux developer community is spread too thin, leading to wasted resources and slow movement on projects. For end users, it can be hard to find the best operating system for them, as there are far too many from which to pick. With all of that said, there is plenty of room for some distributions -- when they make a substantial impact, that is. Elementary OS (stylized as elementary OS) isn't the most popular Linux distro, and it certainly isn't the best. However, this Ubuntu-based operating system is focusing on something that some competitors do not -- user interface, which ultimately contributes to the overall user experience. It is because of this that Elementary is so important to the Linux community -- it matters. Today, Elementary 0.4 (code-named 'Loki'), achieves stable status. While I am sure the Elementary team will cringe at my simplistic explanation, the operating system is essentially an Ubuntu base, with an interface that borrows elements from both GNOME and macOS. Of course, there is much more than just borrowed designs. The operating system makes some odd program choices by default, such as the Epiphany web browser. Is the browser functional and usable? Sure, but it is naive to think most users won't opt to install Firefox, Chromium, or Chrome instead. For email, however, it uses a forked version of the GNOME app 'Geary' (called 'Mail'), which is actually a very good program. ALSO READ: Linux Mint 18 KDE is here -- download the open source Windows 10 alternative now "Loki comes with Linux Kernel 4.4, which means improved hardware support across the board including 6th-gen Intel Skylake processors and graphics. And as previously mentioned, Loki now supports ambient light sensors. Loki also includes LibInput: a new input stack that delivers smoother scrolling, better multitouch and touch screen support, palm rejection, and more", says the Elementary OS team. As seen above, Elementary is adopting a smartphone-like app store design for its software center. Called 'AppCenter', it appears to use Microsoft-inspired tiles for navigation. While it looks clean and functional, it also appears a bit simplistic -- the team has a lot of work to do to improve the appearance. As of now, it looks a bit amateurish. Another big change is an improvement to the 'Files' app. The team explains, "we've made several stability and feature improvements to Files. It now better supports various network folders, SMB shares, etc. We've improved keyboard navigation, added transfer completion notifications, and improved properties dialogs for files and folders with more information and a better representation of disk usage". For a full list of changes (there are many), you can check out the official announcement here. To download, you can get the operating system here. While the Elementary Team asks for donations when downloading, it is actually not required. If you do not have any spare funds, you can select a 'custom' donation and enter zero as seen above. With that said, if you do have some extra money, I would suggest donating if you like it. 53 Comments Tweet Got News?

Credit: Facebook, Inc.   By Julia Rosen Prineville is a sleepy town nestled in the sagebrush desert between the snowy peaks of Cascade volcanoes and the rumpled hills of the Ochoco Mountains. Stunted juniper and shaggy shrubs dot the flat-topped hills that rise above the community of 9,000 people in central Oregon. A narrow ribbon of green — the Crooked River Valley — winds through the parched, buff-colored landscape. It’s striking, but not an obvious place to escape a drought. Yet California technology companies, like Facebook and Apple, have invested millions of dollars in data centers here over the last five years. A former timber town about two hours from Portland, Prineville is the self-proclaimed “cowboy capital” of Oregon — but it has fast become a high-tech hub too. That’s partly because of tax breaks and cheap energy, but it’s also because the cool, dry climate is ideal for data centers. The Facebook data center in Prineville, Ore., was built in an arid grassland and uses cool, dry desert air to help regulate the temperature of its servers. Credit: Facebook, Inc.. These low-slung buildings house the servers that process society’s digital demands. Emails, tweets, credit card transactions — petabytes of data stream through these “server farms” every day. And that requires energy; data centers currently account for about 2 percent of global electricity use. They also require a tremendous amount of water. Servers get hot, and cooling them off has traditionally involved water — hundreds of thousands of liters a day for a medium-sized 15-megawatt data center. And that’s just a fraction of the tech industry’s water footprint. The microchips buried inside every server — and nearly every other electronic device in existence — are also water hogs. Up to 30 liters of water are needed to make a single chip for a laptop or smartphone, and the average semiconductor factory guzzles as much water in a year as a town of 50,000 people. As our seemingly insatiable demand for technology continues to grow, the tech industry’s need for water could become a problem, says Cate Lamb, head of the water program at CDP, a London-based nonprofit that collects information on companies’ climate and water impacts. The world’s freshwater resources are already stressed, and factors like climate change and population growth will only make the situation worse, she says. The Energy Systems Integration Facility at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden, Colo., is working to reduce the lab’s water footprint. Credit: NREL/Dennis Schroeder. NREL designed a cooling system to harvest heat from the servers to warm office buildings on campus, reducing the amount of heat — and water — shed through evaporation. Credit: NREL/Dennis Schroeder. The assumption around water is that there will always be a stable supply of good quality freshwater readily available for us wherever and whenever we want it,” Lamb says, but growing water scarcity in many parts of the world means that assumption may no longer hold. By 2030, the United Nations estimates that — under a business-as-usual scenario — global water demand will exceed known sources by 40 percent. In 2012, Steve Hammond, director of the Computational Science Center at NREL, led a tour during construction of the Energy Systems Integration Facility. Credit: NREL/Dennis Schroeder. That’s why tech companies are working to reduce their water consumption. And they are doing it the way they know best: through innovation. And that’s one reason some ended up in Prineville.   How Data Centers Beat the Heat Facebook’s complex of data centers overlooks the town from a plateau to the west. The buildings are large and plain, except for the entrances. There, visitors must pass through a row of vertical cement towers that evoke the stacks of servers whirring inside. When the first facility opened in 2011, the company boasted that it was one of the most environmentally friendly data centers on the planet. It uses about 40 percent less energy than Facebook’s other data centers, and 70 percent less water, according to company statements. The Prineville data center was also the first to publicly report its water-use efficiency. Anyone with an internet connection can see how the center is performing at any moment. Currently, it averages 0.25 liters of water per kilowatt-hour of energy consumed, about a quarter of conventional facilities. One key to Facebook’s success has been to rethink its cooling strategy. Traditional methods, based on technology similar to air conditioners, use pipes filled with chilled water to draw heat away from servers. That heat is then transferred to cooling towers, where it is removed through evaporation, the same way that sweating cools skin. Much of the water returns to the cooling system, but some fraction is lost in each cycle, and that adds up to millions of liters per year. “We use a staggering amount of water,” says Jack Pouchet, vice president of market development for Emerson Network Power and a board member of the Green Grid, a nonprofit organization based in Beaverton, Ore., that strives to make data centers more sustainable. The National Security Administration’s sprawling data center in Bluffdale, Utah, for example, reportedly uses 6.4 million liters per day — the equivalent of two and a half Olympic swimming pools. Dry cooling technologies do exist, but they often demand more energy. In Prineville, Facebook has developed a more efficient evaporative cooling system, and tries to minimize the amount of time the system operates by using the cool outside air as much as possible. In a blog post for the Open Compute Project — an effort by Facebook to share efficient data center designs — the company likened the approach to putting a fan in the window rather than running the air conditioner. This technique, known as free cooling, has become increasingly common in new data centers. Google’s cooling plants in Hamina, Finland, use water from the Gulf of Finland to cool the data center.

Apple, which just announced plans to construct a third data center in Prineville, will also build a wastewater treatment plant so that it can cool its facility with recycled sewage. Google has established a data center in Hamina, Finland, that uses seawater. And Microsoft has been experimenting with placing pods of servers underwater, which would allow them to position servers close to major population centers and essentially eliminate the need for active cooling.

David Martinez, engineer project lead for infrastructure computing services at the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Sandia National Laboratories, has been working with DOE’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden, Colo., to reduce the water footprint of NREL’s data center. During the first phase of their partnership, they designed the cooling system to harvest heat from the servers to warm office buildings on campus, reducing the amount of heat — and water — shed through evaporation. They also have liquid-cooled servers that use specially treated water that cool them more efficiently than air.   30 liters of water are needed to make one chip for one computer. Credit: K. Cantner/AGI. This spring, Martinez’s team and the NREL team connected the data center’s chilled water system to a “hybrid” cooling tower that doesn’t use evaporation. Instead, heat is released by vaporizing and condensing a refrigerant inside a closed loop — a technique that also works well in places like Colorado, where cool outside air can be used to dissipate heat from the refrigerant coils during much of the year. A similar system had been used before in power plants, Martinez says. “It wasn’t thought of to use in data centers until we started talking about the extreme heats that we are going to be facing and looking for water conservation.” The team started testing the technique this past summer. Martinez says it should reduce water consumption by more than 40 percent, and could serve as a model for other centers.   Flexible Solutions for Inflexible Locations Not all data centers can relocate to places with ideal climates or plenty of nonpotable water resources like treated sewage. Some must be located near population centers, says Shaolei Ren, an electrical and computer engineer at the University of California, Riverside. Especially with the explosion of smart devices and a growing reliance on cloud computing, society now generates too much data to ship it all off to remote locations. “That would be a disaster for the internet because the internet has limited capacity,” Ren says. The solution, he says is “to build a lot of distributed data centers everywhere, even in those places that are not so water efficient.”   Data centers use 2% of global electricity. Credit: K. Cantner/AGI. In many spots — like downtown Los Angeles — outside air cooling isn’t an option, and server farms must compete for limited supplies of reclaimed water. Unlike tech giants that can build their own wastewater treatment plants, many smaller corporate data centers must rely on municipalities. In the San Francisco Bay Area, for instance, although there is plenty of recycled water to go around, problems with water quality and the high cost of connecting to the so-called “purple pipe” — which carries reused water — can be prohibitive for some companies, says Cindy Clark, chief development officer at the nonprofit Sustainable Silicon Valley in Santa Clara, Calif., and founder of its water-reuse project. Installation of massive fans to keep servers and other equipment from overheating, known as free cooling, has become increasingly common in new data centers. Credit: Facebook, Inc. While new waterless cooling systems are being developed, many companies are searching for other strategies to reduce water use at data centers. One way to do that is to cut down on energy use. This both lowers the amount of water indirectly consumed in producing electricity, which often accounts for a big fraction of a center’s total footprint, and results in less heat being generated inside the facility. “It’s a chain reaction,” Martinez says. Reducing energy use can involve steps as simple as installing partitions that prevent hot exhaust air from mingling with the cold air coming in to cool servers, says Pouchet of Emerson Network Power. Decommissioning useless “zombie servers” — those that consume electricity, but that don’t function properly or serve a purpose — and upgrading to more efficient modern equipment can also have a huge impact, Pouchet says. In Hamina, Finland, Google renovated an old paper mill into a data center, which draws water from the sea to cool servers. Credit: Google, Inc. However, changes like these require money, and may be out of reach for many data centers, Ren says. That’s why he’s been working on a cheap solution: using software to schedule workloads in ways that optimize water use. It works by splitting a data center’s tasks into two kinds of jobs. The first includes user requests like web searches and updates to smart devices, which must be dealt with right away. But the second category of processes — such as analyses of user activities that get reported back to tech companies — can easily be delayed by a few hours without disrupting operations. Ren’s software postpones this work until the evening, when the air temperature has cooled and evaporation sheds heat more efficiently. As a result, the data center can complete the same amount of work using less water. Similarly, if a company has many data centers spread across various locations, it could funnel jobs to the most efficient place. “The server system is really intelligent,” Ren says. “This gives us a control knob so that we can shift workloads to places that are more water efficient.” His calculations show that these measures could boost water efficiency by as much as 60 percent. However, despite the high-profile efforts of tech giants like Facebook, industrywide progress has been slow. A recent survey by the Uptime Institute, an independent advisory organization for the tech industry based in Seattle, found that most data center operators view water as a low priority and that fewer than 30 percent even track their water-use efficiency. Multi­tenant data centers pose a particular challenge, Pouchet says. The companies that use them don’t control the facilities, and for many of them, servers are a necessity but not a focus of their business, making data center water use a secondary issue. Extreme events like the drought in California could help change that sooner rather than later. The California Energy Commission recently began offering incentives to data centers that use waterless cooling systems. But even in the absence of such incentives, Pouchet says he’s optimistic. “It’s carrot-and-stick, but we are going to get there.” Leaders like Facebook, Apple and Microsoft have already shown that it’s possible to make huge gains in water efficiency, and expansions in the developing world, where reliable water sources are scarce, have led to even more creative solutions. “I think it’s a problem that is slowly solving itself,” he says.   Ultra Thirsty for Ultrapure Water The specter of water scarcity looms even larger over the semiconductor industry. Semiconductor chips act as the brains of computers, phones, cars and innumerable other devices, but producing them requires huge amounts of water. According to Ceres, a sustainability organization based in Boston, the average semiconductor factory uses up to 15 million liters of water per day — more than many data centers consume in an entire year. The semiconductor industry requires ultrapure water (and ultra-clean rooms). It used to take almost two liters of tap water to produce one liter of ultrapure water, but Intel has reduced the ratio to 1.1 to 1. Credit: Intel Corporation. Like data centers, semiconductor fabrication facilities — known as “fabs” — use water for cooling, as well as for common uses like irrigation and plumbing. But the majority of their water footprint stems from their demand for ultrapure water used in manufacturing. Making semiconductors involves depositing numerous layers of conducting and insulating materials, and etching patterns into them to create circuits. Of the hundreds of steps involved, many rely on chemical reactions that take place in water, or that require thorough rinsing before and after. Because of the complexity of microchips, this water must be exceptionally clean. As the semiconductor industry has kept pace with Moore’s Law — which predicts that the number of transistors crammed into a chip will double every two years — the architecture of modern chips has shrunk beyond microscopic. The holes and trenches that conduct electricity now span only a few nanometers. Even a few tiny contaminants in the water can completely destroy the circuits, says Manish Keswani, a chemical engineer at the University of Arizona. As the architecture of modern chips has shrunk beyond microscopic, even tiny contaminants in the water used to produce them could destroy the circuits.

To get water clean enough for manufacturing, most semiconductor companies buy tap water from the cities in which they operate, then purify it using filtration, reverse osmosis, ultraviolet light and other techniques. However, this process isn’t terribly efficient. It used to take almost two liters of tap water to produce one liter of ultrapure water, says Todd Brady, global sustainability director for Intel, the world’s largest chip manufacturer. Over the last few decades, the company has beaten this ratio down to 1.1 liters of tap water per liter of ultrapure water. In addition, many companies have tried to reduce the amount of water needed for processing, Keswani says. It’s hard to know exactly what individual companies are doing; they closely guard the details of their products and processes. But options include developing dry chemical reactions to replace steps that typically require water and using sensors to determine when rinsing has adequately cleaned the chip, instead of flushing for a set amount of time. For example, researchers at the Engineering Research Center for Environmentally Benign Semiconductor Manufacturing, based at the University of Arizona, developed a sensor to determine when rinsing had reduced contamination to below an acceptable threshold. It won the Editors’ Choice award from the industry magazine Semiconductor International in 2009 for its ability to slash water use in half. However, major suppliers were not interested in buying the technology, says Doug Goodman, co-founder of Environmental Metrology, the now-defunct company that tried to market it. Keswani hopes the university’s latest innovation will have better luck. It’s a way of using high-frequency sound waves to knock particles loose, allowing manufacturers to clean wafers without using chemicals that must be rinsed away. Many companies already use a version of this technique called megasonic cleaning. However, as the features of microchips have gotten smaller and smaller, subjecting them to these frequencies has started damaging them. Keswani has tweaked the approach by using a combination of frequencies, or a single frequency in conjunction with electrochemistry, which appear to limit the destructive effects of the tiny bubbles formed by sound waves that actually do the cleaning. He published the details of these techniques earlier this year, and says it’s too early to gauge their reception. However, he thinks manufacturers will be interested in any water-saving strategies they can use. The industry spends an estimated billion dollars a year on water management. “They would love to have a technology that can save some water,” he says.   Recapture, Recycle and Reuse Despite these gains, however, water use in the semiconductor industry is projected to increase as technology gets more sophisticated. In a recent Corporate Responsibility Report, Intel noted that the more complex its chips become — as it builds features that resemble tall, densely packed skyscrapers instead of sprawling suburban neighborhoods — the more water it will use. Experts also predict that a coming shift toward bigger wafers will also drive up water consumption. Water vapor vents from Google’s data center in The Dalles, Ore. Credit: Google, Inc..

Credit: K. Cantner/AGI. That’s one reason companies are also investing heavily in recycling wastewater. Recycling has long proved tricky because the waste stream from manufacturing includes a kitchen sink of contaminants — from metals to organic compounds — that must be removed before the water is pure enough to use again. However, many manufacturers are trying anyway and entire companies have sprung up to help. One is Ovivo, based in Montreal, Canada. It has developed a method involving bacterial strains that are capable of digesting hard-to-remove organics while withstanding the harsh oxidizing conditions of the wastewater. These bacteria will help companies to recycle up to 85 percent of their ultrapure water, says David Harris, Ovivo’s general manager of electronics and metals for the U.S. “We just finished a pilot system this last year where we’re taking the worst of [a company’s] wastewater and we’re cleaning it up to a very high level of purity cheaper than they can buy city water,” he says. Some semiconductor plants in the U.S. already recycle and reuse 50 to 70 percent of their manufacturing water, Harris says. Drought provided part of the motivation to push that number higher at Ovivo’s pilot project in Texas, and even more is possible, Harris says. It all depends on money. “As the water becomes more scarce, the cost of that water goes up, and that’s what opens the door for applying different technologies to get higher recovery,” he says. In other countries, where water prices and regulations differ, companies have already made greater progress. In Japan, for instance, many fabs produce virtually no wastewater at all. Recycling also has other benefits for manufacturers, like ensuring a reliable water supply. This can help companies weather interruptions in municipal water sources and make the quality of the water more consistent. In some parts of the U.S., like upstate New York, manufacturers have to cope with seasonal changes in city water that stem from changing weather patterns and agricultural activities. With recycling, factories always know what they’re getting. Ovivo is testing several ways to help companies reclaim wastewater at semiconductor production facilities.

Not all wastewater can be purified enough to reuse in chip manufacturing. But many companies are finding other uses for less pure water to offset their overall water withdrawals. For instance, the water can be used for cooling towers or landscaping. These techniques have also spread to corporate offices in Silicon Valley and beyond, says Clark of Sustainable Silicon Valley. “They have amazing water conservation and water efficiency efforts on their campuses.”   Facing the Future Taken together, are these measures enough to buffer the tech industry from increasing water scarcity? It’s hard to say, says Lamb of CDP. “Many companies still today are undertaking seriously inadequate water-related risk assessments,” she says. “Many of them still don’t know where their water comes from, let alone who else might be relying upon that water and how that demand may shift.” Although water availability is a global issue, it is also an intensely local one. Companies depend on the rivers and aquifers that supply water in the places they operate. And even though tech companies don’t use nearly as much water as agriculture, they are often the biggest consumers in their districts. So their fates are inextricably linked to the health of their watersheds, Lamb says. But in many places where tech companies have set up shop, the future of these watersheds is uncertain. Data centers are springing up in deserts, and semiconductor factories can be found throughout water-stressed regions. Eleven of the 14 largest fabs are located in the Asia Pacific region — where demand for electronic devices is high but where the industry must compete with booming populations for scarce water resources, says Quinn Underriner, an analyst focused on the tech and communications sector at the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) in San Francisco. Intel has fabs in water-scarce places such as Chandler, Ariz., where the company built a reverse osmosis plant to clean its manufacturing water. The recycled water then replenishes the city’s aquifer. Credit: Intel Corporation. Some, like Intel — which has plants in China, and in arid places like Arizona and Israel — have worked hard to collaborate with local authorities, Underriner says. Before Intel built its first fab in Chandler, Ariz., a suburb southeast of Phoenix, the company built a reverse osmosis plant to clean its manufacturing wastewater. “We knew we were operating in a desert,” Brady says. “We needed to partner with the local municipality and make sure we were managing water appropriately.” The recycled water is then used to replenish the city’s groundwater aquifer. In Israel, Intel treats wastewater so that it can then be used for agriculture. The Chimney Rock segment of the Lower Crooked Wild and Scenic River near Prineville, Ore.

Thinking ahead about how to manage water and where to source it when developing a new facility is just good business and eliminates the chance of having to close a plant due to a water shortage in the future, Brady says. “You can very much minimize the risk associated with water shortages in the future, but it requires that up-front planning.” For companies that haven’t planned ahead, however, the risks could be severe. Operating costs will rise, and communities could grow resentful of thirsty factories in their backyards. But the biggest danger is that a water shortage will interrupt business, Underriner says. According to a 2008 report by JPMorgan Chase & Co., a disruption could force a semiconductor fab to scrap an entire quarter’s worth of product, which would cost a company like Intel or Texas Instruments, another major chip manufacturer, somewhere between $100 million to $200 million per quarter. Experts say there is still plenty of room for companies to make improvements before it’s too late. Groups like SASB are trying to develop robust metrics to gauge companies’ progress, and others, like CDP, are encouraging them to disclose their practices. Because the implications are clear: “Those that have innovated and developed new business models and new products will win,” Lamb says. Those who are slow to address the issue, or who fail to grasp the scale of the problem, could very well lose.   Julia Rosen Rosen holds a doctorate in geology and is a freelance science writer based in Portland, Ore.

The 39 drivers operate commuter shuttles for Bauer’s big tech clients, including Cisco Systems, Zynga, Electronic Arts and Intuit. The drivers joined the union via a card-check agreement with Bauer’s and will see increases in wages and benefits comparable to those of the Teamster members working at other big tech companies—including drivers for Loop Transportation at Facebook, and for Compass Transportation at Apple, Yahoo and others. One hundred percent of the drivers who participated in the card-check process chose Teamsters representation. The announcement follows more than a yearlong organizing effort by the drivers. “This has been a long struggle for us, but we stuck together and we have always had faith that we would win,” said Art Ariza, a Bauer’s driver. “I’m hopeful and excited now that we have our union. We heard all the success the Teamsters have had representing Loop drivers at Facebook, and we’re looking forward to having what they have, including better pay and health care.” Bauer’s drivers joined with the Teamsters and community members to bring attention to the need for labor harmony in the commuter shuttle industry over the past year. This led to the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency’s (SFMTA) passage of a labor harmony provision under the city’s commuter shuttle program in April. Bauer’s was denied a new operating permit due in part to its poor labor harmony record and to operational issues. This summer SFMTA granted Bauer’s a continuance on the permit decision. The Teamsters are supporting Bauer’s in securing a new permit. “Today’s victory did not come easily, but these workers stayed united,” said Mark Gleason, Teamsters Local 665 Secretary-Treasurer. “We look forward to building a positive working relationship with the company, and bringing the drivers the same protections and benefits that other high-tech shuttle buses have.” “We cannot overstate the incredible role these workers played throughout their campaign, nor can we underestimate the crucial role labor harmony played to help make today’s win possible, and the important role it will continue to play in the Bay Area,” said Rome Aloise, Teamsters International Vice President and President of Teamsters Joint Council 7. “We are continuing and adding to our goal of bringing superior union wages and benefits to all drivers who are working for contractors in the tech shuttle business. This is the only way to protect these improvements going forward for all drivers.” Following this latest victory, Teamsters also encouraged cafeteria workers at Intel organizing with UNITE HERE to follow their lead in a closely watched union election on Wednesday. Yesterday, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors unanimously passed a resolution calling on the San Francisco Recreation and Parks Department to adopt a similar labor harmony policy to the SFMTA's. The Teamsters Union is part of a growing movement of labor, faith and community-based organizations and workers challenging income inequality in Silicon Valley through an innovative partnership called Silicon Valley Rising.

Let's take a close look. By: Chad Sebring | DDR-4 Memory in RAM | Posted: Sep 17, 2016 11:50 pm Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA TweakTown Rating: 93%Manufacturer: ADATA   ADATA had always impressed us with their outside of the box mentality when it comes to RAM heat spreader design. While we have never personally had the pleasure of using an ADATA kit before this, their unique styling and eye-catching designs have made it into many machines that we all see plastered over custom build threads or in modding competitions. ADATA has presented themselves well in near every image we saw of them in the past. However, while aesthetics are the leading reason to attract a customer to a particular set of RAM, the performance has to be there as well, as there is no point in a modern system for memory that is all show and no go.   This new kit sports a new LED light heat spreader, which we have not seen from them in the past, and comes with a funky name as well. ADATA has sent us the AX4U2800W8G17-DRD, or more commonly called XPG Dazzle DDR4. These kits are available in single 8GB sticks, or 16GB, 32GB, and even 64GB kit densities, and range in speeds from 2400MHz, 2800MHz, and 3000MHz kits. Along with the LED lighting of these kits, they also sport TCT, which is how ADATA presents the Thermal Conductive Technology of the metal heat spreaders and how it helps to stabilize the ICs, which are placed on a 10-layer PCB, improving signaling. The ICs used are SK Hynix branded and are said to go through a filtering process to ensure rigid reliability and compatibility standards.   With no previous personal testing of ADATA kits, we are unsure of what to expect, to be honest. This 2800MHz 16GB kit that they have sent us could easily mosey through our testing without much impressiveness to speak of, or they could completely surprise us and show very well against many other fierce competitors on our charts. We do know that so far they are very appealing to look at, as you will soon see for yourself, and with the price of DDR4 being so affordable right now, looks alone could seal the deal for some, but not for us. We need this kit to not only hold its own in XMP testing but also offer more wiggle room beyond that. So, let's put this XPG Dazzle DDR4 2800MHz CAS17 16GB kit through its paces and see what sort of results we get.     This XPG memory comes in a packaging which shows an image of the stick above a cutaway which shows the actual product inside. The black background with the bright yellow and orange plasma-like splashes of color will make your eyes jump right to this kit. In gold, near the top, we see that this set is DDR4 at 2800MHz, delivered in an 8GB per stick density with two sticks in the box. Along the bottom, before we get to the ADATA name, we see icons denoting TCT, Intel XMP 2.0, LEDs, and a lifetime warranty for this memory.     Inside of the box, you will find a pair of sticks, both of them sporting bright red metal heat spreaders, with the accents done in flat black and exposed metal for the XPG naming. The heat spreaders cover black PCBs, and at the top of each spreader is a clear plastic section to allow the lighting to extend past the PCB, and thin metal trim has been applied to it to match the design of the central section below them.     The opposite side of the sticks are identical, aside from on the reverse, we do find the product sticker. Here we confirm the AX4U2800W8G17-DRD model number. This is also where we can see that with the XMP 2.0 profile active, this set will run at 2800MHz with 17-17-17-36 2T timings, and require only 1.25V to do so.     The top edges of the sticks are also impressive to look at, especially once this kit is powered up and illuminated. The metal that is applied to the clear plastic also wraps around to the top of it, but here we find a line along the top which is left exposed. In the center, down in the notch, we see the XPG naming again, and all of the clear plastic you can see at this point will glow red.     After updating the BIOS due to compatibility issues we found with 1701, we are now running 1902 on our ASUS HERO, and the problems disappeared. Enabling the XMP profile in the BIOS, and booting the PC, we can see the XPG Dazzle is very close to the advertised 2800MHz and is indeed running at 17-17-17-36 2T, and we also confirmed the XMP profile voltage at 1.25V.     With the new BIOS in play, we were able to get the timings much lower this time. Where initially CAS14 was failing, and no way to get 1T stable with the 1702 version, the new BIOS delivered success. At this point, upping the DRAM voltage to 1.35V, and adding a touch to the VCCIO and SA voltages, this is what we ended up with before blue screens or instability. Still, at 2800MHz, we were able to get these timings down to 13-14-14-36 at 1T command rate without a hiccup.     Failing at trying the 2900MHz and 2933MHz memory dividers previously, the new BIOS helped out a bunch in this area too. Using the XMP timings and the same voltages used to lower the timings, as we went for their top speed, this is where it ended. Here, we are using the 3100MHz memory divider, and to get the last drop of speed out of them, we did increase the BCLK to 101MHz. This left us stable as can be with an overall speed of 3131MHz on our XPG Dazzle DDR4.   GO TO TOP OF THE NEXT COLUMN ^     AIDA64 delivered results we expected to see with the XMP 2.0 profile set. The XPG Dazzle competes head to head with the likes of the Mushkin, which is slower but has tighter timings, and outperforms the rest of the slower kits on this chart. Reducing the timings shows a distinct advantage, and delivers results similar to those found in some of the 3000MHz kits. However, with this set of memory, it is the speed that wins the day in this test, and while not the best on the chart, they do come close to some much more expensive solutions.     Using Mem TweakIt for an efficiency number, we see that with the XMP profile and the lowered timings, the XPG Dazzle DDR4 holds its own with its direct competition. Once we ran testing at the maximum speed achieved, our efficiency results jumped dramatically and put this kit into the top five results in out testing with this benchmark. It is random in which a kit can break the 70,000 mark here, but it seems the XPG Dazzle has what it takes when they are set in this manner.     When it comes to image editing, encoding, and multi-tasking, the XMP profile offers respectable results for the speed and timings that are provided in this DDR4. Comparing to other XMP runs, ADATA can do better than a few of the higher speed kits were able to produce. Where a lot of our testing shows instances where more speed can win the day in this benchmark, it is the lowered timings results which are the best for this kit using RealBench.   While this RAM from ADATA may not have set any records with us, the results we saw, allowing this slower kit to compete with some of the 3000MHz and 3200MHz kits head to head, is in and of itself impressive, to say the least. Using SK Hynix ICs, and moving to the new BIOS, we feel we took every drop of performance that the XPG Dazzle DDR4 had to offer, and are pleased with those results as well. Dropping the timings as we did is impressive, not as a whole, as many kits will get this low relatively quickly, but it is the fact that we did this with just 1.35V.   In most of our testing, it takes all of the 1.45V we run on kits with a higher initial voltage to get these sort of results. We do feel that there was more speed to give judging by the Q-Codes we were seeing when trying to go further, but sticking within our boundaries, we set for each kit. The 3131MHz we obtained is all free, and where some kits barely move, 300MHz over their rated speed is just whip cream and a cherry on top of this red and black sundae.     Once the kit is powered and working inside of your PC, you are dazzled by the pulsing of the red LEDs of this XPG DDR4 memory. The tops and sides of the sticks come to life with a mild red glow emanating from all of that clear plastic section we saw earlier. As for the way in which they pulse, they are lit for a few seconds, and fade out for a second, and come right back on. Initially, the sticks would pulse in sync, but as time goes on and the way in which the sticks are called on by the motherboard, the LED lighting does go out of phase with each other after just a few minutes. The lighting is pleasant to look at with just two sticks in play, but would look so much better with four sticks pulsing back and forth, or even eight sticks for those of you running X99 systems.   While we did recognize right away that something was amiss, our first thought was to look for a new BIOS, and we are glad we did. The XMP 2.0 profile worked fine in both versions, and the test results were very close in both batches of testing, so for the majority of users, you will likely not run into the limits we found overclocking them. However, once running the latest BIOS, this XPG Dazzle DDR4 16GB kit did everything we would expect from a kit with this density and timings and even offered us more than we expected with the limited voltages we used for these results.   For those of you looking to plug-and-play with this kit, you will be pleased with what you are offered in gaming and its feel day to day with whatever workload you put on them. For those of you looking to tweak this kit to its extreme ends, ADATA delivers enough in timings or speed to keep you adjusting things to their best performance levels. With our down and dirty methodology, we were still impressed, and had we had a week or more to tinker with this kit and finalize the best balance of the RAM, we feel it can be even more impressive than what we have shown, in the right hands of course.   At this time, availability on this side of the Atlantic is a big fat goose egg for this particular kit. We were able to find many other versions of this memory on Newegg, and there we spotted the 2400MHz XPG Dazzle in 16GB kits for just $80.99, and the 3000MHz kit listed at $119.99, again in 16GB densities. However, the option to buy the 2800MHz kit is shown but is currently grayed out on the Newegg pages. With basic math involved, we found a $39 difference in the kits and splitting that difference again results in the fact that this kit should be offered near the $100 price point. Considering speed, density, and capacity, this does leave the ADATA XPG Dazzle DDR4 2800MHz 16GB kit at the upper end of pricing. Out of all of the offerings we see listed, none have a look like these do, and while many kits come dressed in red and black, these 47.3mm tall sticks should easily find a home in any rig, and be a stunning addition to any system.     Chad's DDR4 Dual-Channel Test System Specifications   Motherboard: ASUS Maximus VIII Hero - Buy from Amazon / Read our review CPU: Intel Core i7 6700K - Buy from Amazon / Read our review Cooler: Corsair H110i GTX - Buy from Amazon / Read our review Video Card: MSI GeForce N760 2GD5/OC ITX - Buy from Amazon / Read our review Storage: SanDisk Extreme II 120GB - Buy from Amazon / Read our review Case: Cooler Master MasterCase Pro 5 - Buy from Amazon / Read our review Power Supply: Thermaltake TPSG 1050W - Buy from Amazon / Read our review OS: Microsoft Windows 10 Home 64-bit - Buy from Amazon Software: CPU-Z 1.74.0 x64, MemTweakIt, RealBench 2.41, AIDA64 Engineer 5.50.3600 Product Summary Breakdown Performance (including Overclocking) 93% Quality including Design and Build 95% General Features 96% Bundle and Packaging 94% Value for Money 89% Overall TweakTown Rating 93% The Bottom Line: ADATA's XPG Dazzle 2800MHz sticks offer pleasing aesthetics, a calm red glow, and are tuned to hang with faster kits we have previously tested.

That’s a bit of a head-scratcher, given that with the iPhone 6s, Apple had one model that worked across all U.S. carriers. Even though most consumers don’t change carriers during the life of the phone, why would Apple seemingly take a step backward in terms of flexibility and simplicity? The reason has everything to do with the way the company does business. Apple loves to have more than one supplier of any key component. And while it designs the iPhone’s A10 processor (and that chip’s predecessors), it has long relied on Qualcomm exclusively for the iPhone’s modem chip. Exclusivity gives a supplier more leverage, and Apple likes to bargain from a position of strength. So there has been talk for a while now that, with the iPhone 7, Apple was going to split the modem business between Qualcomm and Intel. But Intel’s latest modem chip doesn’t support the old CDMA standard still used by Sprint and Verizon. By creating a separate version for Sprint and Verizon, Apple is able to use Qualcomm exclusively on that model while using chips from both Intel and Qualcomm for the GSM model used by AT&T and T-Mobile as well as many carriers in other parts of the world. Sources familiar with the situation as well as outsiders agree that the modem diversification effort is the likely reason for the separate phone versions. Apple and Intel declined to comment on the matter, and a Qualcomm representative was not immediately available for comment. While having separate models is a win for both Intel and Apple’s effort to gain more power over its suppliers, it’s a modest loss for customers, who now have to make a technological commitment to a carrier even in a world where many are no longer signing long-term financial contracts. As noted above, though, it’s a flexibility that few consumers take advantage of. The vast majority of people who change carriers do so at the same time they get a new phone. There are often switcher deals that make it more financially attractive to do so, and it’s just the way most people think about their cellphone service. For those who really want maximum flexibility, Apple offers the Apple Upgrade Program through its stores. With that program, you finance your phone over two years, but have the option to upgrade phones and change carriers each year. recode_divider In this Storystream All about the iPhone 7 What the iPhone 7 reveals about Apple’s augmented-reality plans Apple created extra versions of the iPhone 7 in order to make room for an Intel chip Apple’s iPhone upgrade program: How to turn your 6s into a 7 View all 13 stories More From Recode DraftKings and FanDuel used to hate each other.

The IMC's IoT Readiness Calculator, to be introduced at this week's CTIA Super Mobility 2016 exhibition in Las Vegas, will survey users about their business requirements as well as technical issues like security, latency, integration, and scalability. Uniquely, the survey tool will then compare the results with others polled in the same vertical end-use markets to provide a scorecard about project readiness. Opt-in user data will be collected, and the software widget is also expected to be an excellent lead-generation tool for companies on the IMC's Board of Governors. "The IoT Readiness Calculator includes some fairly sophisticated algorithms to determine the individual score for a user's planned IoT project, and then shows how that project stacks up to others in the same field," says IMC executive director Keith Kreisher, "The users receive an email with their scores, as well as indication of where they need improvement, and advice on solutions providers to contact." The first IMC board companies to deploy the widget will be Aeris, Intel, Kore, and Orbcomm, who will embed their websites with links to the survey tool. The software is designed to provide a seamless user experience, including host-company branding. "Several of our IMC board companies have developed similar tools, but the consensus was that earlier surveys weren't technical enough to provide a real assessment about project readiness. This widget was developed to address those issues for hands-on managers, as well as to provide leads to our sustaining companies," says Kreisher. Only IMC Sustainer companies will be allowed to install the IoT Readiness Calculator, and first showing of the widget will be at the IMC's booth at the CTIA show in Las Vegas starting on 7 September 2016. The widget can be accessed at www.iotreadinesscalculator.org. About IoT M2M Council (IMC) The London-based IMC is the largest and fastest-growing trade group dedicated to the global IoT/M2M sector - with over 18,000 IoT buyers (enterprise users and OEMs) joining as members since 2014. IMC Board member-companies include Aeris, AT&T, Deutsche Telekom, Digi International, Ingenu, Inmarsat, Intel, KORE, Nighthawk Control, ORBCOMM, Semtech, SIGFOX, Telecom Italia, Telit, Verizon, Vodafone, and Wipro.

The total number of mobile (cellular) subscriptions for 5G is expected to increase from 35.0 million by 2021 to 89.0 million by 2022 The prominent factors that are driving the paradigm shift toward new broadband technology include the rising demand for high data speed and large network coverage, significant growth in the mobile data traffic, growing machine-to-machine communication in organizations, and need to support the increasing demand for broadband services over mobile networks. The countries that are expected to be the early adopters of 5G technology are the U.S., Japan, South Korea, and China. In North America, the U.S. is leading the race in the advancements in mobile technologies, ranging from analog to 4G and now in the 5G technology. The U.S. remains a strong player in the vision and R&D of 5G by ensuring it meets the requirements of the North America's marketplace. Government and private investments in R&D for 5G has been significantly increasing since 2010 to ensure the deployment of 5G technology by 2020. The U.S.-based carriers such as AT&T and Verizon have announced trials and early deployments of 5G technologies, thereby demonstrating a commitment to 5G leadership. 5G is seen as a revolutionary technology for all sectors, which would enable higher connectivity among devices and fast data transfer rate. A number of applications can be identified where current wireless network technologies struggle to meet the requirements such as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), industrial automation and utility applications, wireless health services, some smart city applications, and various other uses of mobile broadband. Though 5G would have high penetration across all sectors, the major verticals that would adopt 5G-based applications include automotive, energy & utilities, healthcare, industrial automation, intelligent buildings & infrastructures, public safety & surveillance, retail, consumer electronics, and home automation.

2016 to 2022 This "Agricultural Drones 2016 to 2022" report provides insight into the adoption trends, market dynamics, competitive landscape, pipeline products, current and emerging players as well as market outlooks.   Market Research Report (EMAILWIRE.COM, September 17, 2016 ) Agricultural Drones: Market Shares, strategy, and Forecasts, worldwide, 2016 to 2022 Size and Share Published in 2016-04-04 Available for US$ 4100 at Researchmoz.us Description The 2016 study has 288 pages, 127 tables and figures. Worldwide agricultural drone markets are poised to achieve significant growth with the use of cameras on stable flying platforms that are used to help implement precision farming. Crop visualization lets farmers better control and isolate areas for spraying and lets the drones do the spraying. Agricultural drones use automated process to make farming more productive. Drones provide better, more flexible visualization. Smart drone agricultural uses cameras and provide the prospect of trillions of dollars in farming economic growth. Smart commercial drones connect seamlessly and securely to the Internet and to each other. Agricultural drone technology has reached a level of maturity that has put these systems at the forefront of farming modernization. Farmers around the entire world are adapting to drone availability, using aerial cameras to visualize plants. Use cases are evolving rapidly. Video, specialized video, targeted video, and agricultural spraying systems are offered. Agricultural Drones Use Technology for Spraying, Mapping, Pest Control, Seeding, Remote Sensing, and Precision Agriculture Agricultural technology uses drones to leverage a data-driven future. Inexpensive sensors, cloud computing and intelligent software used in a drone system hold the potential to transform agriculture and help feed the worlds growing population. Venture investment in agricultural drones has been strong. Investment of venture capital in agricultural technology start-ups reached $2.06 billion in the first half of 2015, 4.25 billion in 2015 doubling the amount of capital invested in this area in 2014. Agricultural drones leverage the Internet of things (IoT). IoT brings sensors to supplement images of the land from above, making it possible to communicate and use analytics to understand changes in vegetation. Digital electronics brings significant change to the ancient manual processes of farming. Markets portend to reach multitrillion-dollar payoff from the emerging technology that increases the production and distribution of food. There are technical and policy issues to leverage the potential of the drone use of the Internet of Things (IoT). Challenges include security, privacy and standards. Hackers can enter apparently secure networks to remotely control engines, brakes and steering. This could create a problem on a farm if the network was hacked. Get a Free Sample Copy of the Report: http://www.researchmoz.us/enquiry.php?type=S&repid=686323 Agricultural industrialization has been brought in some measure by tractors and columbines. Drones bring far greater automated process. Preindustrial agriculture, dating from before Christ to about 1920, consisted of labor-intensive, essentially subsistence farming on small farms. This took two acres to feed one person. With industrial agriculture, from 1920 to 2010, tractors and combine harvesters, chemical fertilizers and seed science opened commercialization of farms. Gains in productivity achieved one acre feeding five people. Digital agriculture brought by drones is part of the next stage in industrialization of agriculture. It involves exploiting data from many sources  sensors on farm equipment and plants, satellite images and weather tracking. The use of water and fertilizer is measured and monitored. Growing can be monitored on a plant-by-plant basis. Plant factories are being implemented worldwide that use 97% less water than an outdoor growing environment. Drones are anticipated to be used in those environments indoors. The data-rich approach to decision making represented a sharp break with tradition. It is a totally different world than walking out on the farmland, kicking the dirt and making a decision based on intuition. Transparency is a significant aspect of sensor use in farming logistics. Consumers care that their food is cared for in the proper manner: end to end. According to Susan Eustis, lead author of the study, Transparency is one of the benefits of IoT that drones bring to digital farming. The benefits of digital farming are higher productivity and more efficient use of land, water and fertilizer. Transparency in farming is being asked for by consumers. Consumers want to know where their food came from, how much water and chemicals were used, and when and how the food was harvested. They want to know about consistent refrigeration during transport. Use of drones represents a key milestone in provision of value to every industry. Customized cameras are used to take photos and videos with stunning representations. Digital controls will further automate flying, making ease of use and flight stability a reality. New materials and new designs are bringing that transformation forward. By furthering innovation, continued growth is assured. Inquiry on this report: http://www.researchmoz.us/enquiry.php?type=E&repid=686323 The worldwide market for agricultural drones is $494 million anticipated to reach $3.69 billion by 2022. The complete report provides a comprehensive analysis of drones in different categories, illustrating the diversity of uses for remote flying devices in farming. Analytics makes the images more cogent to farmers, letting them anticipate problems that only become visible to human farmers days or weeks after the drone images detect issues.

MySQL Server Blog News from the MySQL Server Team Menu Skip to content About Resources Search for: MySQL 8.0: Faster batch record retrieval September 14, 2016MySQL, Optimizer, PerformanceKnut Anders Hatlen One of the things we have been working on for MySQL 8, is speeding up scans that read multiple records from a table or an index. Such scans benefit from reading the records in batches, so that they don’t get the overhead of latching data pages and navigating in the B-tree for every single record that is read. When the MySQL server asks the storage engine for a record, the storage engine may therefore choose to prefetch a batch of records into a buffer, so that it can quickly return a record from the buffer when the server asks for the next record. Background In previous versions of MySQL, the storage engine has no knowledge about how likely it is that the server asks for more rows in the scan, so it had to guess if it is worthwhile to prefetch a batch of records. In the case of InnoDB, scans started by reading and returning a single record at a time for the first three records. When the MySQL server requested the fourth record, InnoDB assumed that the scan would read even more records, and thus it would allocate and fill a small prefetch buffer to speed up subsequent requests. Our testing showed that while this prefetch buffer does indeed speed up scans, it could be improved: The size of the prefetch buffer was limited to 8 records. Large scans often benefit from a larger prefetch buffer. If the storage engine knew up front that multiple records would be fetched, it could have allocated the buffer at the beginning of the scan. This eliminates the need to read the first four records one by one. Improvements in MySQL 8.0 In MySQL 8, we have improved the prefetching by taking the query optimizer’s estimates into account when allocating the buffer (WL#7093 – Optimizer provides InnoDB with a bigger buffer). Before starting a multi-record scan, the query executor will ask the storage engine whether it can make use of a buffer for fetching batches of records. If the storage engine says it can, the query executor allocates a buffer and gives it to the storage engine. The query executor has access to the optimizer’s estimates, and it uses the estimates to determine what is a reasonable buffer size. If the optimizer has estimated that a large number of records will be retrieved in the scan, a larger buffer can be allocated, which could greatly reduce the number of times latches need to be acquired on the B-tree pages. At the moment, InnoDB is the only storage engine that takes advantage of this buffer, but it is a generic optimization that could be used by other storage engines. So, what kind of improvements can we expect to see in MySQL 8? To find out, I used SysBench to compare the performance of MySQL Server 5.7.14 and MySQL Server 8.0.0 DMR. I chose to run the OLTP simple ranges query, as it seemed like a good candidate to benefit from these changes. The query selects multiple records whose primary keys are in a certain range (SELECT c FROM t WHERE id BETWEEN <start> AND <end>). I built a test table with ten million records in it, and ran the test on a 16-core Intel Xeon 2.90GHz with 128GB RAM running Oracle Linux 6.5. The MySQL server instances were configured with innodb_buffer_pool_size=16G, so that the entire database resided in main memory. The charts below summarize the the results for various combinations of range sizes and number of concurrent threads that access the database. The first chart shows the single-threaded performance, and the second one shows the multi-threaded performance. For small ranges the performance is essentially the same on 5.7.14 and 8.0.0. When selecting larger ranges, however, there seems to be a good performance improvement with MySQL 8.0.0 DMR compared to MySQL 5.7.14. In this test, when selecting ranges of 1000 rows or 10 000 rows, MySQL 8.0.0 DMR performed between 7% and 10% better than MySQL 5.7.14. We also see good performance improvements with MySQL 8 in other benchmarks. For example, the chart below shows results from the DBT-3 benchmark. Many of the DBT-3 queries get a nice speedup. For some of them, the execution time is reduced by more than 15%. Conclusion This optimization applies on InnoDB tables by default starting from MySQL 8.0. You do not need to enable any settings or run any commands to turn it on, and it makes scans faster (index scan, range scan, table scan). It also applies to both single threaded, and multi-threaded query execution. Please try it out, and let me know your results! Post navigation ← MySQL 8.0: Now documented with Doxygen!

Investors continue to remain on edge regarding the possibility of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates at its meeting next week. Banks also fell, led by a plunge in Deutsche Bank after the giant German lender said it wouldn't settle with the Department of Justice over its handling of mortgage securities in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 88.68 points, or 0.5 percent, to 18,123.80. The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 8.10 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,139.16 and the Nasdaq composite fell 5.12 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,244.57. The U.S.-listed shares of Deutsche Bank dropped $1.38, or 9 percent, to $13.38 after the bank said it did not intend to pay the $14 billion settlement that the U.S. government asked for. Federal regulators have been looking to settle with Deutsche Bank, as it has done with the other major Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase & Co., for its role in the mortgage bubble and financial crisis. Other European banks fell as well. Royal Bank of Scotland Group fell 30 cents, or 6 percent, to $4.86. The news out of Deutsche Bank dragged European stocks lower, with Germany's DAX closing down 1.5 percent, France's CAC-40 index down 0.9 percent and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 index down 0.3 percent. Stocks have been volatile this week, with the Dow moving more than 100 points four out of five days. Most of the volatility has come as investors prepare for next week's Fed meeting. While most investors do not expect a rate increase, there is a small but noticeable likelihood there will be one. "By the Fed's own criteria, everything is in place for them to raise rates. But still, people don't think they are going to raise rates, so the market is in conflict," said David Kelly, chief global investment strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management. In other company news, pharmaceutical company Novavax plunged $7.05, or 85 percent, to $1.29 after the company said its experimental vaccine failed in late-stage clinical testing. Novavax has no active products on the market and this drug was their furthest in development. Intel rose $1.11, or 3 percent, to $37.67 after the company raised its revenue forecasts, citing stronger-than-expected demand for personal computers. The S&P 500 is adding a new industry to its traditional groups for the first time since the dotcom era. The benchmark stock index will now have a real estate sector, which will be split off from the financial services component. The new industry component will be effective at the end of trading Friday. After the split, the S&P 500 will have 11 industry sectors. The 10 current sectors of the S&P 500 are: financial services, information technology, energy, industrials, consumer discretionary companies, materials, telecommunications, consumer staples, health care and utilities. Benchmark U.S. crude lost 88 cents to $43.03 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, fell 82 cents to $45.77 per barrel. Heating oil fell 1 cent to $1.41 a gallon, wholesale gasoline rose 3 cents to $1.46 a gallon and natural gas rose 2 cents to $2.948 per 1,000 cubic feet. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was mostly unchanged at 1.69 percent. The euro fell to $1.1151 from $1.246 and the dollar rose to 102.42 yen from 102.16 yen. In metals, gold fell $7.80 to $1,310.20 an ounce, silver fell 18 cents to $18.86 an ounce and copper was unchanged at $2.16 a pound. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The Kangaroo Mobile Desktop, perhaps most famous for offering an entire PC for about the same price as a Windows 10 license, now has a more expensive notebook cousin. InFocus is touting its $300 Kangaroo Notebook as the world's first modular laptop. Shipping in mid-October, it includes a lightweight laptop dock, with two—count 'em—two interchangeable Kangaroo mini PCs running Windows 10. Why two? InFocus envisions that you'll use each one separately. You might configure one with strict parental controls for your kids. Or you might set one aside for work email and spreadsheets and the other for Web surfing and Netflix streaming. //Related Articles InFocus Releases New Kangaroo Mobile Desktop Pro Two entirely separate PCs might seem like a blunt way of accomplishing something that you could also do by setting up separate user accounts on the same computer. But with a $300 asking price, you don't have a lot to lose. Of course, that low price doesn't deliver a lot of computing power. The swappable modules have 2GB of RAM, 32GB of eMMC storage, and an Intel Atom x5 CPU, similar to those found in computers on a stick from Asus and Intel. The laptop body, into which you insert the mini Kangaroo PCs, has an 11.6-inch display, a full keyboard, clickpad, battery, webcam, microphone, and speakers. Details such as battery life and which ports are included weren't immediately available. Essentially, the Kangaroo Notebook is a Chromebook competitor for people who prefer Windows and need to keep their personal, work, and family computing lives completely separate.

NEW YORK — Stocks were moderately lower Friday, pushed down, in part, by the price of oil. Investors continue to remain on edge regarding the possibility of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates at its meeting next week. Banks also fell, led by a plunge in Deutsche Bank after the giant German lender said it wouldn't settle with the Department of Justice over its handling of mortgage securities in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 88.68 points, or 0.5 percent, to 18,123.80. The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 8.10 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,139.16 and the Nasdaq composite fell 5.12 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,244.57. The U.S.-listed shares of Deutsche Bank dropped $1.38, or 9 percent, to $13.38 after the bank said it did not intend to pay the $14 billion settlement that the U.S. government asked for. Federal regulators have been looking to settle with Deutsche Bank, as it has done with the other major Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase & Co., for its role in the mortgage bubble and financial crisis. Other European banks fell as well. Royal Bank of Scotland Group fell 30 cents, or 6 percent, to $4.86. The news out of Deutsche Bank dragged European stocks lower, with Germany's DAX closing down 1.5 percent, France's CAC-40 index down 0.9 percent and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 index down 0.3 percent. Stocks have been volatile this week, with the Dow moving more than 100 points four out of five days. Most of the volatility has come as investors prepare for next week's Fed meeting. While most investors do not expect a rate increase, there is a small but noticeable likelihood there will be one. “By the Fed's own criteria, everything is in place for them to raise rates. But still, people don't think they are going to raise rates, so the market is in conflict,” said David Kelly, chief global investment strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management. In other company news, pharmaceutical company Novavax plunged $7.05, or 85 percent, to $1.29 after the company said its experimental vaccine failed in late-stage clinical testing. Novavax has no active products on the market and this drug was their furthest in development. Intel rose $1.11, or 3 percent, to $37.67 after the company raised its revenue forecasts, citing stronger-than-expected demand for personal computers. The S&P 500 is adding a new industry to its traditional groups for the first time since the dotcom era. The benchmark stock index will now have a real estate sector, which will be split off from the financial services component. The new industry component will be effective at the end of trading Friday. After the split, the S&P 500 will have 11 industry sectors. The 10 current sectors of the S&P 500 are: financial services, information technology, energy, industrials, consumer discretionary companies, materials, telecommunications, consumer staples, health care and utilities. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was mostly unchanged at 1.69 percent. The euro fell to $1.1151 from $1.246 and the dollar rose to 102.42 yen from 102.16 yen. More Business Cozy retirement?

Is it possible for us to have one article on this site that doesn't get overrun with incessant whining about headphone jacks or the lack of Mac updates? You can't possibly NOT know that the headphone jack issue has been discussed extensively on this site. All worthwhile discussion on the topic has long since been exhausted. Please let it go. Any further discussion on this is simply an indication that you want to annoy others by rehashing the topic. [doublepost=1474138582][/doublepost] Wow Apple Watch OS3 sucks so bad. I hate it. The got rid of glances! I used that to quickly next music while at work. Are you kidding? watchOS 3 is a revelation - it makes the original Apple Watch so much better! Glances were essentially barely functional screenshots of apps. They've been replaced by the Dock, activated using the lower side button, which gives you immediate access to actual in-memory, running apps, and the rightmost entry in the Dock is "Now Playing", giving you access to those controls you wanted. If you want even quicker access, you can set a complication to "Music", and get to the controls with one tap - as a bonus, if you use one of the long complications, it'll show the track currently playing. And they've made it easier to quickly change between watch faces, by swiping across the screen, making it more reasonable to keep multiple watch faces around configured for specific situations, so you can have one for the office, with a music complication set up.

Scenes in Apple stores around the world yesterday were reminiscent of days before online ordering became a norm and people camped out for days to be first to get hands on the California company’s iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. Enthusiasm was peppered with disappointment due to shortages of the large-screen iPhone 7 Plus and a jet-black iPhone 7, but it was unclear if the shortages were the result of strong demand or limited supply. “These initial sales will be governed by supply, not demand,” Apple said in a released statement which noted that the company would not provide launch weekend sales figures. Investors evidently weren’t certain of what to make of the launch as well, with Apple shares down about a half-percent to USD 114.92 at the close of trading on the Nasdaq exchange.

At the Apple Store in the Georgetown district of the US capital Washington, dozens of consumers were still waiting in line hours after the store opening to get the new handsets. “I tried to order it online, but I would have had to wait five to six weeks, so standing in queue was the only option,” said Naval Chopra, who was visiting from India at the time of the launch and joined the waiting group at 5:30 am for an iPhone 7. “If you’re an Apple fan, there is something special about getting the new phone on the launch day.” Washington resident Isaac Combs said he had being hoping to get the large-screen iPhone 7 Plus but learned on arrival they were sold out. Still, he opted for the iPhone 7, despite the smaller display. The iPhone, Combs said, “is an essential part of life, it’s something I use every day.” Apple sold of the larger models quickly and had limited availability of the iPhone 7, with the new jet-black color especially scarce.

Pentium G3258? - 09-16-2016, 18:13 | posts: 83 | Location: Philadelphia, PA HIya, I'm looking to put together a system mainly going to be used for game hosting duty so I don't plan to run any games on it. One of the main concern is energy usage and I read the Pentium G3258 or so called Pentium K has a very low energy usage so that is good. The software running on it will probably not going to take advantage of a 2nd core so getting anything like a quad core chip will probably be an overkill. Do you think I can get away with the Pentium K or perhaps one of the AMD A8 series chip? I read that typical Intel chip has more capable single core performance than similar priced AMD chip? Thanks for any info.     f14dude View Public Profile Find all posts by f14dude   « Previous Thread | Next Thread » Thread Tools Show Printable Version Email this Page Display Modes Linear Mode Switch to Hybrid Mode Switch to Threaded Mode Posting Rules You may not post new threads You may not post replies You may not post attachments You may not edit your posts BB code is On Smilies are On [IMG] code is On HTML code is Off Forum Rules Forum Jump User Control Panel Private Messages Subscriptions Who's Online Search Forums Forums Home General Chat     The Guru's Pub     Folding@Home - Join Team Guru3D !     Frontpage news     Digital Photography, Home and Portable Electronics     Tablets and Smart Phones     The HTPC, HDTV & Ultra High Definition section Videocards     Videocards - NVIDIA GeForce     Videocards - NVIDIA GeForce Drivers Section     Videocards - AMD Radeon     Videocards - AMD Radeon Catalyst Drivers Section     Videocards - 3dfx     Videocards vs General Purpose - NVIDIA Ageia PhysX, GPGPU etc.     3D Stereo Gaming Section     Benchmark Mayhem Hardware     General Hardware     Die-hard Overclocking & Case Modifications      Computer Monitor Forum     Soundcards, Speakers HiFI & File formats     SSD and HDD storage     Processors and motherboards AMD     Processors and motherboards Intel     Network questions and troubleshooting     Laptops & Notebooks Affiliates     Rivatuner Generic Discussion forum         RivaTuner Advanced Discussion forum     MSI AfterBurner Overclock Application Discussion forum     MSI AfterBurner Private Beta access     ATI Tray Tools         ATI Tray Tools Generic Discussion             ATI Tray Tools Public Beta Section     Guru of 3D Clan General     Games, Gaming & Game-demos     Game Tweaks and Modifications     Consoles & console games     Operating Systems     General Software and Applications     Hardware Reviews and News     Programming/Html     Links Powered by vBulletin® Copyright ©2000 - 2016, Jelsoft Enterprises Ltd. vBulletin Skin developed by: vBStyles.com Copyright (c) 1995-2014, All Rights Reserved.

Butterfield & Son Ltd on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York on Friday. Photo: Bloomberg US stocks fell on Friday as the possibility of a US$14 billion fine against Deutsche Bank weighed on big banks and investors wrestled with lingering uncertainty about when the US Federal Reserve would hike interest rates. The settlement proposal, made during negotiations between the US Department of Justice and Deutsche Bank over claims that the German bank missold mortgage-backed securities, was larger than expected. Deutsche Bank’s US-listed shares slumped 9.35 percent. Dow components Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan fell by more than 1 percent each. The S&P 500 financial index dropped 0.91 percent, dragging down the benchmark index the most. The KBW Bank index fell 1.11 percent and logged its second straight week of declines. Traders have all but ruled out the possibility of the Fed raising interest rates at its meeting, which starts on Tuesday. However, residual doubts and questions about when the Fed might finally pull the trigger still hurt sentiment. “It’s the uncertainty of next week, the complacency of investors trying to re-evaluate their portfolios as we prepare for an interest-rate hike,” said Jeff Carbone, cofounder of Cornerstone Financial Partners in Charlotte, North Carolina. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.49 percent to finish at 18,123.80 points and the S&P 500 fell 0.38 percent to 2,139.16. The NASDAQ Composite fell 0.1 percent to 5,244.57. With futures and options contracts expiring, about 9.3 billion shares changed hands on US exchanges, above the 6.6 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data. For the week, the Dow edged up 0.2 percent, the S&P gained 0.5 percent and the NASDAQ jumped 2.3 percent. The technology index on Friday dropped 0.33 percent, pulled down by Apple’s 0.56 percent decline and Oracle’s 4.75 percent drop following weak quarterly profit. Helping limit losses was Intel’s 3.04 percent gain to a 15-year high after the chipmaker raised its third-quarter revenue forecast. The CBOE Market Volatility index, Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” declined 5.7 percent. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.79-to-1 ratio; on NASDAQ, a 1.18-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 5 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the NASDAQ Composite recorded 88 new highs and 50 new lows. This story has been viewed 1449 times. Comments will be moderated.

When: 7 p.m. Oct. 15 Where: Northpoint Church, 988 W. Ontario Ave., Corona Cost: $15 for adults, $13 for seniors and students Information: 951-808-3281 TO SIGN UP Who: Children of all ages and musical skill levels can sign up for the conservatory. What: A 15-week course for $150. Where: Corona Civic Center, 815 W. Sixth St., Corona Registration information: 951-833-1157 An expectant silence filled the dark, cavernous Northpoint Church during a recent Corona Symphony Orchestra rehearsal. The 1,000-plus seats were empty. The only light shone on 50 musicians on a large wooden stage, readying for the debut of “Circle City Suite” – a musical homage to the history of Corona and Norco composed by California Baptist University music professor Glenn Pickett. Pickett sat cross-legged by the harp, breathing heavily and clutching the sheet music he took two years to write, eyes fixed on conductor Marco Mejia. After a delicate flute interlude, the orchestra erupted in a thunderous movement that reverberated through the church. A beaming Pickett, now sitting bolt upright in his chair, flashed a toothy grin and a thumbs up. By the time the orchestra’s Oct. 15 show rolls around, 75 Southern California musicians – many of whom play professionally – will premiere Pickett’s suite along with several other well-known selections. The concert also aims to garner interest in orchestra-sponsored youth music programs, said Don Kindred, executive director of the nonprofits. This summer, 170 students participated in the Corona Youth Conservatory – a route to local orchestras hosted at the local Civic Center. Last year, the first Corona Youth Symphony Orchestra was launched. “Our end goal is to get our youth kids sitting up there with these guys,” Kindred said during the Northpoint rehearsal.“We’ve given our students a pathway to improve and have a place to perform.” CORONA’S ORCHESTRA In 2001, Kindred was approached by a church musician who asked off-handedly if he was still playing bass. At 52, Kindred hadn’t played much over the past two decades, but he took a set of the sheet music and began rehearsing for the upcoming show. “I realized very early on there was a ton of talent in the IE, with very few groups or venues to perform in,” Kindred, now 67, said. With the help of some business-minded musicians, Kindred formed the nonprofit Corona Symphony Orchestra in 2008. The first show, at the Corona Civic Center, was an overwhelming success. In need of more space, Kindred cut a rental agreement with Northpoint Church pastor and music afficionado David Hague. Hundreds of musicians have since auditioned for a part in the ensemble, many with musical degrees and experience playing around the globe. A glance across the stage during a recent practice revealed a wide range of players – from teens to septuagenarians, dressed in T-shirts or business suits. Noemy Wheeler was born in El Salvador, her father an orchestral conductor and missionary. Wheeler attended music schools in Morocco and Spain. During a 2005 performance in Spain, a 26-year-old Wheeler was recruited to pursue master’s degrees in violin performance and conducting at California Baptist University in Riverside. During her studies and subsequent teaching position at Cal Baptist, Wheeler honed her skills at the Corona Symphony Orchestra. She’s played in professional and community orchestras around the world and has backed out of community groups that didn’t meet her standards. “I’m picky about who I play with,” the Moreno Valley resident said. “In Corona, it’s dynamite. We like excellence. Our conductor pushes us a lot, and we have a good group of people that care about quality.” Jordan Horwich plays cello in the Corona orchestra. The 55-year-old Corona resident just retired from Intel after decades working there. In his formative years, Horwich said he was invited to attend the Juilliard School in New York, but decided to pursue a more profitable career. “I’ve played with nearly every community group in Orange County and many in Riverside County, Corona is the best I’ve ever played in,” Horwich said. “It’s great to be able to put on that variety of music to attract different people and friends to these performances,” Horwich said. UP-AND-COMERS The orchestra’s success helped realize another Kindred brainchild: a youth music conservatory where Inland youngsters could receive low-cost instruction in cello, violin and bass – instruments not typically encouraged at public schools, explained Lori Bonner, a music teacher at the conservatory and El Cerrito Middle School in the Corona-Norco Unified School District. The conservancy began four years ago in a school cafeteria. Only four students showed up to those first classes. Pianist Michaella Ottolini was one of the original four. A pianist first and principally, the 16-year-old Corona native joined the conservatory to try her hand at cello. She was named to the youth orchestra last year. 1 2 Next Page Digital & Driveway Delivery - 50% Off More from Corona Foothill Parkway extension set to debut in Corona New details revealed as Riverside man charged with killing Long Beach man in Temescal Valley 2 arrested in connection with Corona 7-Eleven robbery COMMENTS | PRINT | EMAIL |    Join the conversation Comments are encouraged, but you must follow our User Agreement We invite you to use our commenting platform to engage in insightful conversations about issues in our community.
