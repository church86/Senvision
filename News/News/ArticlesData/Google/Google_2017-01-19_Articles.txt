Budget 2017: Why a post-Budget fall won't mean achhe din are over for markets. Read about it in our Budget 2017 coverage SAN FRANCISCO: Google is acquiring Twitter's mobile application developer platform Fabric, a move which could give some breathing room for the social network after charting an independent path without a suitor. Terms of the deal were not announced. Twitter last year was in talks to sell itself with several firms including Google parent Alphabet, but without a deal decided to continue on an independent path, cutting jobs and refocusing on its core services. The sale of Fabric will shift to Google the platform used by developers for mobile apps. "When we launched Fabric in 2014, our goal was to provide the best tools to help developers create amazing apps," the Fabric team said in a blog post. "Today we enter the next chapter for Fabric and are pleased to announce that we've signed an agreement for Fabric to be acquired by Google and for our team to join Google's Developer Products Group, working with the Firebase team." Google Firebase product manager Francis Ma said buying Fabric will "continue the great work that Twitter put into the platform," adding that "our missions align closely: help developers build better apps and grow their business." Twitter has been in a reorganization phase as it seeks to hit profitability for the first time, and to boost user growth which has been stagnating in comparison with other social networks.

Attorney General Jim Hood sued the California-based computer giant Friday in Lowndes County Chancery Court. In a news conference Tuesday, Hood said Google is breaking Mississippi consumer protection law by selling ads using data from services it provides to schools. “They’re building a profile so they can advertise to them,” Hood said. “They expressly stated in writing that they would not do that.” Google did not immediately respond Tuesday to an email from The Associated Press inquiring about the lawsuit. Hood said a test involving a student account from the state-run Mississippi School of Math and Science in Columbus showed ads targeted to previous searches. The attorney general wants a judge to order Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc., to stop the practice. The suit says Google could be fined up to $10,000 for each of its student accounts in Mississippi. With half the state’s school districts using Google’s email, calendar and other online services, that amount could top $1 billion. Hood sent a letter to local school superintendents Friday asking them to preserve evidence to help with the lawsuit. He’s advising parents to consult their local school systems. “When you give a written contract and you don’t follow it and you mine the data, then it’s a violation of the Mississippi Consumer Protection Act. It’s an unfair and deceptive trade practice,” he said. Google sued Hood in 2014, saying his wide-ranging attempts to investigate whether Google was aiding music pirating and illegal drug sales were illegal. The U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in April that Hood’s inquiry is legal. Hood said Tuesday that the investigation continues but denied that he was motivated by personal animus against Google. “You make decisions based on the facts and the law and you set emotions aside,” Hood said. Some Mississippi Republicans continue to try to trim Hood’s ability to file civil lawsuits without outside permission, part of a long-running Republican perception that Hood pursues civil lawsuits in part to provide income to plaintiffs’ lawyers who politically support him. Hood said outside lawyers brought the student privacy issue to him after publicity about his earlier dispute with Google. A committee in the Republican-led House Tuesday passed House Bill 555, which would require a three-person panel of the governor, lieutenant governor and secretary of state to approve plans to file any civil lawsuit where the state could win more than $250,000. That panel is supposed to approve hiring outside lawyers for big lawsuits but has never met, because Hood has instead hired lawyers according to a pre-set fee schedule that an earlier law allows as an alternative. The bill to limit Hood’s powers now moves to the full House. Similar measures have failed in previous years. House Judiciary A Committee Chairman Mark Baker, a Brandon Republican, said Hood’s use of civil lawsuits is a “rampant abuse” of his role. “Every lawsuit that he files is a declaration of public policy” Baker said. “We’re the legislators, the setters of public policy. He’s the lawyer. He’s not also the client.” Hood, though, said efforts to limit his power violate the state’s Constitution. The attorney general’s victories have contributed tens of millions of dollars to patch state budget holes in recent years. For example, Mississippi will gain $25 million from a settlement with New York-based Moody’s Corp., over credit ratings the company assigned to various securities before the financial crisis. Last year, Hood collected about $55 million from lawsuits against large companies. Copyright 2017 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

This will form part of the Google Developer Products Group. “Fabric and Firebase operate mobile platforms with unique strengths in the market today, “ Fabric general manager and vice-president of engineering, Rich Paret, said in a blog post. "We're excited to combine these platforms together to make the best mobile developer platform in the world for app teams." “When we met the team at Google we quickly realised that our missions are the same - helping mobile teams build better apps, understand their users, and grow their businesses,” he added. Since inception, Fabric has grown to reach 2.5 billion active mobile devices, built by 580,000 developers. The platform was announced as part of Twitter in October 2014 and comprised multiple kits including Crashlytics and Answers, designed to help developers address issues affecting mobile app stability by providing real-time analytics to detect, assess and fix bugs. Crashlytics will become Firebase’s main crash reporting tool, according to a blog post by Google Firebase product manager, Francis Ma. The acquisition also allows Google to gain access to a Twitter Kit which, according to eweek, allows developers to use Twitter and distribute mobile applications through a native Tweet embedding capability. Additionally, Google will acquire MoPub, described by Twitter as a “monetisation platform”, for developers to integrate ad-serving features in their mobile applications, as reported by eweek.

Choosing between Google Photos or Google Drive for image backups Google Photos and Drive complement each other in some ways and offer stark differences in others. Derek Walter on 18 January, 2017 23:00 0 - - - - print email Google Photos is usually one of the services I rave about to friends and family members who ask for my advice about where to keep all their digital memories. It performs some rather magical search in recognizing people and objects from your photos. And you can’t beat the unlimited storage options: anyone who buys a Pixel gets full-resolution storage of their images for life. Other Android phones still have a solid choice in free storage if you’re willing to live with a little compression, or Google’s ultra-cheap backup pricing (100GB is $20 per year). But a lot of recent conversations and forum posts have indicated that many people still have a lot of photos in Drive or want to know how to use that service in tandem with Google Photos. You may have a large backup already saved there, and want to take advantage of all of the cool features in Google Photos. The services do work together, but there are a lot of peculiarities. And despite all the neat Photos tricks, there are a few advantages to Drive. Here’s how to sort through the Google photo storage cloud. Where Google Photos excels For most, Google Photos is going to be the better product, particularly if you have a “mobile first” lifestyle. The primary storage vault is the cloud, and Google makes it easy to clear the images off your smartphone for safekeeping. Greenbot Google Photos will keep free your phone’s internal storage by moving everything to the cloud. The other reason Google Photos is so good is that it leverages the company’s algorithmic smarts. No need for putting groups of images together in folders or albums (though you can make your own albums if you want to). The app also includes some great sharing features and from time to time you’ll be treated to videos and compilations that turn similar images into one moving GIF. Other landscapes may also be transformed into black and whites or more artistic images. And search is way better than endless scrolling. Greenbot Google Photos does the organizational work for you. But the big feature we’re talking about here is the storage. You get unlimited photo backup at “high quality” which involves some compression. Google says pictures taken at a quality of lower than 16MP will look the same with the compression compared to saving them with a full backup. Unless you have a Pixel, you’ll need to make a choice here. With this in mind, there may be some reasons why Drive might be the better choice. Google Drive has its perks, too If you keep a more traditional organizational scheme in regards to your photos, or if you’re a professional photographer, you may need Google to keep its hands off your images. You don’t want to be bothered by numerous enhancements. That's where Google Drive comes into play. Also, Google specifies that RAW images are only supported for specific types of cameras. Drive may be ideal if you do most of your photo editing on the desktop but want cloud storage as your backend to ensure everything is saved. This is best if the majority of your images are on your PC. All you have to do then is to put them in a folder that’s synced with Drive. You can see them in the mobile app as well. Drive, as you can see from the image below, gives you a much larger list of options for what you can do with each image. Greenbot Google Drive has a wider selection of options for what you can do with an image compared to Google Photos. Of course, the main hangup will be that Drive doesn’t function like a proper backup tool on your phone. That must be done through Google Photos. So what you can do is use Photos for phone backup, but then do most of your gallery viewing or editing work through Drive. The bottom line is this: Drive is kind of like the backend for Google Photos, so you can get to your images there. Navigating the two services is less about switching than using them together. Moving day One scenario might be that you have a massive glut of old images that you don’t want to delete, but aren’t wild about sucking up all your Drive cloud storage. If you don’t mind compression (Google says there’s very little difference if your images are 16MP or less) then take advantage of the free storage offer. Here’s the recommended workflow: First, download the Google Photos uploader for Mac or PC. Then, choose where the images are that you want to upload. The software will then get to work putting your pictures in Google Photos. Greenbot You can add images from your computer to your Google Photos account. Your images will of course remain on your computer’s hard drive, but now they’ll be featured inside of Google Photos on the web and in the Android app. On the desktop, one of the downsides to the cloud-only approach is that you’ll have to download the images from Google Photos if you want to do any deeper edits beyond what’s possible with the Photos editor. I enjoy that I don’t have my entire photo collection taking up space on my PC, but downloading images from time to time is a pain. Playing both sides There is another scenario you may want to consider: not choosing at all. With a little bit of work and ingenuity you can use both services, but you need to check on a few things to ensure that you don’t end up duplicating your data and chomping into your Drive allotment. Let’s say you have a large catalog of photos that are saved in Drive. You can trigger all the magic of Google Photos automatically, without much hassle. In the Settings of Google Photos, toggle this: Greenbot Get the best of both worlds by showing your Google Photos in your Drive library. If you don’t want to pay for more storage, you can upload them to Google Photos under the free and unlimited plan. Then all you really have to do is flip a switch. In Google Drive, toggle on the following option to see all your images in there. Greenbot Any pictures added to Photos can automatically show up in Drive. One thing to keep in mind is that in Drive, the organizational scheme is going to be different. All of the auto-created albums aren’t there. Instead it’s a long scroll of images in sequential order. However, if you use the Drive desktop application any images you add to Photos will be there under a separate folder called, you guessed it, Photos. Any edits or deletions you make will reflect inside the Google Photos app. The services can work in tandem as described. You’ll just have to play with them a bit and make sure things are aligned to your own workflow. Top 5 Windows 10 Products More from Microsoft Windows 10 Join the Good Gear Guide newsletter!

Anthony Grifoni STYLISTIC Q572 For work use, Microsoft Word and Excel programs pre-installed on the device are adequate for preparing short documents. Steph Mundell LIFEBOOK UH574 The Fujitsu LifeBook UH574 allowed for great mobility without being obnoxiously heavy or clunky. Its twelve hours of battery life did not disappoint. Andrew Mitsi STYLISTIC Q702 The screen was particularly good. It is bright and visible from most angles, however heat is an issue, particularly around the Windows button on the front, and on the back where the battery housing is located. Simon Harriott STYLISTIC Q702 My first impression after unboxing the Q702 is that it is a nice looking unit. Styling is somewhat minimalist but very effective. The tablet part, once detached, has a nice weight, and no buttons or switches are located in awkward or intrusive positions.

Terms of the deal were not announced. Twitter last year was in talks to sell itself with several firms including Google parent Alphabet, but without a deal decided to continue on an independent path, cutting jobs and refocusing on its core services. Twitter chief technology officer leaving The sale of Fabric will shift to Google the platform used by developers for mobile apps. “When we launched Fabric in 2014, our goal was to provide the best tools to help developers create amazing apps,” the Fabric team said in a blog post. “Today we enter the next chapter for Fabric and are pleased to announce that we’ve signed an agreement for Fabric to be acquired by Google and for our team to join Google’s Developer Products Group, working with the Firebase team.” Twitter unveils 360-degree live video Google Firebase product manager Francis Ma said buying Fabric will “continue the great work that Twitter put into the platform,” adding that “our missions align closely: help developers build better apps and grow their business.” Twitter has been in a reorganization phase as it seeks to hit profitability for the first time, and to boost user growth which has been stagnating in comparison with other social networks.

By India Ashok January 19, 2017 04:45 GMT Close Why hacking is a booming industry IBTimes US An organised cybercrime syndicate, which was believed to be responsible for pulling off one of the biggest cyberheists in 2015, is now reportedly using Google services for its malware monitoring purposes. Security researchers believe that the Carbanak gang, named after their customised malware, has taken to using Google services to issue its command and control (C&C) communication, in efforts to better track and control its current and potential victims. The Carbanak hacker group, also known as Anunak, is believed to have been operational since 2013. However, it was only in 2015 that the group's activities came to light, after the cybercriminals used their Trojan malware to launch targeted attacks against global banks, making away with an estimated $1bn. According to Forcepoint security researchers, the group has updated its VBScript malware, which now comes with the ability to use Google services. This allows the attackers to send and receive commands from and to Google Forms, Google Sheets and Google Apps Script services. The hacker group's most recent campaign, dubbed "Digital Plagarist" saw the hackers use "weaponised" office documents hosted on mirror domains, in efforts to distribute the malware. Forcepoint researchers said: "Using Google as an independent C&C channel is likely to be more successful than using newly created domains or domains with no reputation." Researchers noted that by using Google services, the hacker group can dynamically create Google Sheets spreadsheet, which in turn allows systems to fairly simply manage infected victims. Hackers can leverage the updated malware to check on victims' infected machine's status, remotely send commands and more. The Carbanak hacker group, also known as Anunak, is believed to have been operational since 2013Reuters "The use of a legitimate third party service like this one gives the attacker the ability to hide in plain sight. It is unlikely that these hosted Google services are blocked by default in an organisation, so it is more likely that the attacker will establish a C&C channel successfully," the researchers said. Forcepoint researchers said that they have notified Google about the abuse of services and are "working with them" to uncover more details. In December, TurstWave security researchers uncovered that the gang was back, this time targeting the hospitality sector with renewed vigour. TrustWave noted that the hacker group had added cyberespionage-like features to its original malware in efforts to evade detection. Researchers also speculated that the shift in target focus, as well as the geographical broadening of targets could indicate the group's intention to expand its activities. Several cybersecurity firms have previously indicated that the group may likely be Russia-based and possibly backed by an organised crime syndicate, given their sophistication and high-profile attacks. The group is also believed to be responsible for conducting a wave of cyberattacks on PoS systems, including the Oracle data breach.

Google is required to pay taxes from 2011, said Director General of Taxation Ken Dwijugiasteadi as reported by tempo.co on Thursday. The government says Google owes Rp 337.5 billion (US$25.28 million) in taxes, plus Rp 3 trillion in penalties as the tax office estimates that Google’s revenue reached Rp 6 trillion in 2015. (Read also: Tax office threatens to probe Google case) The move to investigate the tax case was initiated because Google failed to provide clarification over its advertisement transactions and server in Indonesia, Ken added. He said his office would summon Google representatives on Thursday. “Anyone [in Google management] is responsible for the case,” Ken said. Meanwhile, Directorate General of Taxation head M. Haniv said his office needed information regarding Google’s advertisement transactions to decide the amount of “special taxes” that should be paid by the over-the-top (OTT) company. “After the amount of taxes has been decided, the government will seek advice from the House of Representatives,” Haniv said, adding that during the investigation, his office would involve police and prosecutors.

We'll share further details in the coming weeks after we close the deal, as we work closely together with the Fabric team to determine the most efficient ways to further combine our strengths.

A teardown of the new beta version of the Google Assistant app for Android, done by XDA Developers, shows that you will soon be able to make payments through Assistant across supported devices. There is no clarity as to how the mechanism will work. XDA says that a string found in the app’s code indicates that it can let users of the Google Pixel smartphones make purchases through Assistant. At the same time, it can also control which other devices can authorise payments. One of those devices includes the voice-activated Google Home speaker. According to Business Insider, users will be able to make credit card payments for delivery services or online shopping, such as using Google’s Express Shopping marketplace. Considering Amazon’s Alexa and Apple’s Siri both support payment capabilities, it is just the next logical step for Assistant as well. Apple has also applied for a patent to enable peer-to-peer payments using iMessage via Siri. Alexa is expected to come built into LG smart refrigerators which will give you the ability to make purchases via the assistant as well. It is simplified with Amazon Echo and Echo Dot products, using Alexa, because these devices are already tied into your Amazon account where you have your payment details stored. It is just a matter of enabling 1-click payment and Amazon lets you buy physical products from its store as well as digital music. Google Assistant is expected to come to other platforms, such as Android Wear based smartwatches, Android TVs and even inside cars in the upcoming months. The possibilities of shopping via these multiple platforms are immense. Google has not yet confirmed the payments feature on Assistant officially.

In fact, even though Google switched its focus to its latest Pixel line, Nexus 6P is still generating huge amounts of profits for the company. While it has reached its one year milestone, the device’s sales percentages are still high. One of the greatest things about Nexus 6P isn’t just its hardware performance but the fact that it runs on Google’s latest Android 7.1.1 Nougat operating system. While this update has made the majority of Nexus 6P users happy, for some it proved to be quite problematic. The reason behind this is that Android 7.1.1 Nougat contains a bug that puts the device into a bootloop mode. What this means is that the device will keep on restarting over and over thus being rendered completely useless. What’s even more annoying than that is the fact that isn’t any solution available right now. Users who have been affected by this problem said that they have tried downgrading the operating system back to Android 6.0 Marshmallow and sadly the problem kept persisting. When Google was faced with this issue, it advised Nexus 6P users to return their device to the store from where they’d bought it from. If the phone is still in warranty, the store is forced to either fix the problem or provide customers with a brand new device. This solution helped the majority of Nexus 6P users but some didn’t have the same luck. What happens is that if the device presents cosmetic damage, the store backs out of repairing it.

What makes this device so special is the fact that it has been designed for outdoor activities and it comes with a rough exterior. In fact, the smartphones actually passed the US Military test, meaning that it won’t break if its dropped on the hard ground and that its water and dust proof. The reason why we’re talking about Samsung’s Galaxy S6 Active version is because the major US network carrier known as AT&T just started rolling out Google’s December security update to it. The update is being rolled out OTA (over the air) and it weighs in at 14MB. Additionally, the software update increases the device’s firmware build number up to G890AUCS5CPK4. AT&T released the patch notes and to everyone’s surprise December’s security patch is the only thing included in the update. Nonetheless, users should keep their eyes peeled at their notifications panel because the update should arrive every day now. In case it doesn’t automatically pop-up in the notifications panel users can always check for it themselves by accessing the Settings menu. Even though Google already launched January’s security patch and the update has yet to arrive, it’s always better late than never. Especially since these days the internet is filled with hackers and malicious software around each corner. Google takes Android user security very serious and this is why it launches a new security patch every month which fixes known security flaws. The reason why Google rushed to launch January’s security patch is because two of its own Nexus device were affected by a major exploit. As a refreshment, Samsung Galaxy S6 Active edition ships with a 5.1 inch Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen display that has a pixel resolution of 1440 x 2560 and 576 ppi and which is coated in Corning Gorilla Glass 4. In terms of hardware specs, the device is powered by an octa-core Exynos 7420 processor that’s paired with a Mali-T760MP8 and 3GB of RAM. With all of these impressive hardware pieces it’s easy to see why this device is considered as being one of the best Samsung has ever made.

The US tech giant is known for teaming up with other major tech manufacturers and launching great devices in the Nexus lineup. In fact, back in 2011 Google acquired Motorola and designed Nexus 6 which is one of the best Android powered devices ever made. Weirdly enough, even though Nexus 6 brought huge amounts of profits to Google and Android fans were happy with it, Google decided to sell the rights to Motorola over to Lenovo in 2014. As a result of that Google had to partner with another manufacturer and Huawei was the chosen one. During their partnership the two companies created Nexus 6P which ended up being Google’s flagship device until a couple of months ago when the Pixel lineup was launched. Looking at sales percentages, this was the right move but what Google didn’t have success with was creating a worthy successor to Nexus 5. The Android parent teamed up once again with LG and created Nexus 5X in hopes of recreating the success they had together with Nexus 5 but to Google’s surprise, Nexus 5X wasn’t so well received. In fact, according to a sales percentage report, Nexus 5X is on the lowest spot in Google’s sales numbers. Nexus 5X isn’t only doing bad sales wise, but in popularity as well. A recent Android survey pointed out that Android fans would rather choose the older Nexus 4 or Galaxy Nexus over the LG-made Nexus 5X. In order to make Nexus 5X more appealing towards customers, Google made a bunch of Nexus 5X deals through its Project Fi. Even though customers are able to benefit from discounts that go up to $150 they still won’t acquire Nexus 5X. Although it might sound like Android fans just don’t like Nexus 5X, there’s a good reason behind that. The LG-made phone is suffering from one major issue which puts it into a boot loop mode. This problem came along Google’s latest Android 7.0 Nougat and it renders the device unusable.

Terms of the deal were not announced. Twitter last year was in talks to sell itself with several firms including Google parent Alphabet, but without a deal decided to continue on an independent path, cutting jobs and refocusing on its core services.

Now of course, there is a catch here. Google, irrespective of its brilliant engineers, cannot defeat the laws of physics and return the search results from the web when there is no data connection in a smartphone. Just that now the Google app will now won't tell offline users that it can't complete the search. Instead, it will queue up the search query and complete the search when the phone connects to internet. "Mobile networks can sometimes be inconsistent or spotty, which means that even if you have a connection when you start your search, it might fail before you get your results back," Google's  Shekhar Sharad wrote on the company blog.

So the next time you lose service, feel free to queue up your searches, put your phone away and carry on with your day. The Google app will work behind-the-scenes to detect when a connection is available again and deliver your search results once completed," he said.Although this is not any solution to the internet connectivity issues that people face, particularly in countries in India, it just makes it slightly more convenient to use the Google Search on smartphones.   For now the feature is available only on Google Search app for Android. To get this feature, all that users have to do is update the app on their phone by going into the Play Store.

The company's CEO Sundar Pichai had said this offline YouTube feature was specifically created keeping Indian users in mind. But then proved so useful and popular that the company also rolled it out in other regions.   For more news from India Today, follow us on Twitter @IndiaTodayTech and on Facebook at facebook.com/indiatodaytech For news and videos in Hindi, go to AajTak.in.ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों और वीडियो के लिए आजतक.इन पर आएं.   Most Read Lenovo is launching a new Moto phone on Feb 26 Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 launching in India on Jan 19, but Ravindra Jadeja isn't impressed Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 may come on Jan 19, exclusively on Flipkart Moto G4, G4 Plus, G4 Play get massive discounts up to Rs 8,500 on Amazon Reviews AKG K72 headphones review: Large, comfortable and big booming bass Fossil Q Nate watch review: It's not very smart Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 review: Raising the bar Creative Muvo 2 review: Best for the bass-heavy music Coolpad Mega 3 Review: Buy it only if you use 3 SIM cards VIDEOS Vivo V5 Plus review Review: Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 Signs you are a gadget addict more Tech Tips Tech tip: Use this free method to watch region-locked YouTube videos in India OnePlus 3 and Android Nougat: If you can't wait, get it manually in easy steps Tips to take stunning photos using smartphone Here are 4 tips to use Paytm safely Yahoo hack: Lessons to learn from biggest data breach ever more Talking Points Javed AnwerRepublic Day Parade is magnificent but PIB wants us to believe it's a sad event Javed AnwerVodafone's new 4G plans: Bonanza for prepaid users, post-paid users forgotten Javed AnweriPhone at 10: It once changed the world, now time for Apple to change it Priya PathakDid you hear about Airtel's free data offer?

Android Anna Scantlin Contributing Editor | January 18, 2017 48 shares 26 8 0 7 0 0 1 3 3               Google shook things up last fall when the company decided to unveil its new Pixel brand rather than their usual Nexus phone (or phones). More than just a simple rebranding, Pixel took stock functionality and great performance, but nixed the “affordable” aspect Nexus had become known for in favor of more powerful hardware across the board; Nexus was only powerful in some aspects, but typically suffered from others such as weak battery or lackluster camera performance. Pixel is essentially Nexus without any sacrifices, and so far appears to be on the fast track to long-term success.  Another contributing factor into Pixel’s success: advertising. Google has been noticeably aggressive with its advertisements for Pixel; Nexus, on the other hand, was hardly advertised in its later generations – and when it was, it certainly wasn’t to this extent. Between lack of advertisement and exclusive availability to Google’s online store, it was easy to forget that the brand even existed. I do wonder how Nexus would have done with a fiercer marketing campaign, but that is neither here nor there; Nexus is dead now. But hope is not lost for those who may still want to experience “pure” Android without having to pay Pixel’s premium price tag, as a new report from The Information suggests that Android One, Google’s low-cost Android solution for developing markets, may be making its way to the U.S. Additional details of the leak reveal that the first Android One may arrive as early as the middle of the year with a price of $200-$300, and would receive updates for two years. Like the Nexus line, Android One uses hardware manufactured by a third-party company under the guidance of Google. Thus far, companies like QMobile, Cherry, and Micromax have created Android One phones for other regions. Although details haven’t been revealed on a U.S. model’s manufacturer, I suspect that a more familiar name would be used to help propel potential sales – perhaps LG or HTC. At $200-$300, Android One could be a good replacement for Nexus, even though it may have a different focus. Nexus specialized in providing a powerhouse experience with powerful processors and good cameras, but those specs often came with a sacrifice from battery life and sometimes a weak camera. I praised these features in Nexus for a long time because, at the time, I think that’s what the industry needed. At this point, however, there seems to be a big push for the opposite: less flagship status and more balance. I mention this often, but the line between “flagship” and “mid-range” is much thinner than it used to be. I typically use a flagship as my daily driver, but on occasion I’ll still pick up a more affordable smartphone just to use something different. Over the past year, I’ve used devices like the Honor 5X and Nexus 5X and while there are some notable differences between them and my Galaxy S7, they’re not going to be that noticeable for most people. We’ve grown so used to the idea that flagships are absolutely necessary in order to get the best experience possible out of our smartphones, but that’s just not true anymore. Most people could sacrifice top of the line specs for something more modest for a better price and still have an excellent smartphone experience. I do think that Android One may struggle in the sense that the U.S. market still puts most of its focus on flagships, but I think that it would still be a good option for people who may want something similar to the Pixel but don’t necessarily want or need the premium hardware that comes with it. At the very least, it helps to fill the void that Google left when it became official that Nexus wasn’t coming back. And who knows? Maybe Android One will end up having an even bigger following than Nexus. Readers, what are your thoughts on this rumor? Do you hope to see Android One come to the states? If so, who do you hope to see manufacture them?

This will form part of the Google Developer Products Group. “Fabric and Firebase operate mobile platforms with unique strengths in the market today, “ Fabric general manager and vice-president of engineering, Rich Paret, said in a blog post. "We're excited to combine these platforms together to make the best mobile developer platform in the world for app teams." “When we met the team at Google we quickly realised that our missions are the same - helping mobile teams build better apps, understand their users, and grow their businesses,” he added. Since inception, Fabric has grown to reach 2.5 billion active mobile devices, built by 580,000 developers. The platform was announced as part of Twitter in October 2014 and comprised multiple kits including Crashlytics and Answers, designed to help developers address issues affecting mobile app stability by providing real-time analytics to detect, assess and fix bugs. Crashlytics will become Firebase’s main crash reporting tool, according to a blog post by Google Firebase product manager, Francis Ma. The acquisition also allows Google to gain access to a Twitter Kit which, according to eweek, allows developers to use Twitter and distribute mobile applications through a native Tweet embedding capability. Additionally, Google will acquire MoPub, described by Twitter as a “monetisation platform”, for developers to integrate ad-serving features in their mobile applications, as reported by eweek.

Google News employs tags on news stories which have been covered by several outlets. These include: “Opinion,” “Trending,” “In Depth,” “Most Referenced,” “Highly Cited” and “Live Updating.” The Daily Caller has found multiple examples of straight news stories being marked “opinion.” One outlet this frequently happens to is The Daily Beast. Screenshot of Google News Screenshot of Google News While the stories are marked “opinion,” they contain none. It isn’t an opinion to cover a statement by Wilbur Ross, nor is it opinionated to write that a former president is hospitalized. This mischaracterization of articles as opinion can be found on almost any news story covered by several outlets on Google News. Screenshot of Google News Screenshot of Google News Mike Dyer, president and publisher of The Daily Beast, told TheDC in a statement Wednesday that “as a credible, well respected news organization, we find it concerning our content is being misrepresented to consumers.” Do You Think Google Is Trying To Discredit The Daily Caller?   Yes         No        Completing this poll entitles you to Daily Caller news updates free of charge.

A Google spokesperson, however, told TheDC that the site hasn’t received any complaints before about the incorrect tagging and that they don’t believe it’s a big issue. The spokesperson said that it is a likely a problem with Google News’ algorithm and not a human error. The site will continue employing the “opinion” tag, as Google engineers try and get to the bottom of the problem, according to the Google spokesperson. “We are looking into issues with how the ‘Opinion’ label is assigned to stories in Google News. Our engineering team is investigating the root cause, including how sections of publisher content are tagged as ‘Opinion’ by publishers and via the Google News Publisher Center,” a spokesperson said in a statement provided to TheDC. A poll released by Pew Wednesday revealed that nearly 20 percent of American voters got their election news from Google News.

Wednesday, January 18, 2017 [Tweets] [Favorites] The Problem With AMP Kyle Schreiber (via Hacker News): The largest complaint by far is that the URLs for AMP links differ from the canonical URLs for the same content, making sharing difficult. The current URLs are a mess. They all begin with some form of https://wwww.google.com/amp/ before showing a URL to the AMP version of the site. There is currently no way to find the canonical link to the page without guessing what the original URL is. […] AMP is about lock-in for Google. AMP is meant to keep publishers tied to Google. Clicking on an AMP link feels like you never even leave the search page, and links to AMP content are displayed prominently in Google’s news carousel. This is their response to similar formats from both Facebook and Apple, both of which are designed to keep users within their respective ecosystems. However, Google’s implementation of AMP is more broad and far reaching than the Apple and Facebook equivalents. Google’s implementation of AMP is on the open web and isn’t limited to just an app like Facebook or Apple. […] The AMP HTML Specification states that all AMP HTML pages must load a JavaScript file from https://cdn.ampproject.org/. If you already run Google Analytics on your pages you probably don’t care that you’re loading yet another black-box JS file from Google. But sites that load absolutely nothing from external sources (such as this one) should understand the privacy and security implications that come along with running JavaScript that you don’t control. greenspot: Google is abusing its powers. The search rank is our currency and Google has pushed AMP sites to the top for some while. So, everybody is now building weird AMP layers for their sites. We went from a free to a proprietary mobile web in just a few weeks. And we can’t do anything. It feels like the times when the Internet Explorer tried to rule except that more people were complaining. The open solution to a faster mobile web would have been so easy: Just penalize large and slow web pages without defining a dedicated mobile specification. That’s it. John Gruber: The lock-in aspect makes no sense to me. Why would I want to cede control over my pages to Google? AMP pages do load fast, but if publishers want their web pages to load fast, they can just engineer them to load fast. Best answers I got were that it wasn’t really strategic — publishers are going with AMP just because their SEO people are telling them to, because Google features AMP pages in search results. I suppose that is a strategy, but ceding control over your content to Google isn’t a good one in the long term. Previously: Google’s Accelerated Mobile Pages.

Despite RBC nabbing a big name, it’s hard to be optimistic that the stars of a hot, made-in-Canada tech field won’t decamp to the U.S. anyway Adrian Lee January 18, 2017 Follow @AdrianKLee Twitter Facebook Google+ Share LinkedIn Reddit Email   A Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) sign is seen outside of a branch in Ottawa. (Chris Wattie/Reuters) These days, deep learning is all the rage. Tech’s biggest players, from Intel to Amazon, are betting big on the artificial intelligence technique modelled after the instincts of the human brain, with its ability to read patterns, sense rules, and make the best decision accordingly. Not long ago, Google spent more than $400 million to buy industry-leading startup DeepMind, and scored a major tech and marketing coup when the computer AlphaGo defeated grandmaster Lee Sedol at the possibility-lush game of Go—an achievement hundreds of times more complex than when Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov at chess. Deep learning is being touted as a way forward for climate science, medicine and genomics; it’s already embedded in the way you search for something online, when you Google image search for, say, “cat,” and feline photos come up as a result of AI learning of what “cat” means. But it wasn’t always the popular kid in the block. In its early days in the 1980s, deep learning’s mostly Canadian pioneers—in particular, the trio of Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio, and Yann LeCun, who worked largely out of an institute in Toronto—were dismissed as foolish apostates. “At the time, it didn’t solve big practical AI problems, it didn’t replace the existing technology,” said Hinton, considered the godfather of deep learning, in a 2016 interview with Maclean’s. But when computing power started to advance at an incredible rate, deep learning’s potential for AI was unlocked, turning huge piles of data into artificial intelligence that could, effectively, learn like our brain. MORE: Geoffrey Hinton explains how deep learning works Canada, though, hasn’t enjoyed much benefit for being an early adopter on the forefront of this technology. American companies have mostly picked the cupboard clean: Hinton now works with Google, LeCun leads Facebook’s AI research lab, and Bengio is an adviser with IBM, whose work out of the University of Montreal has earned significant funding from Google and beyond. Even Hinton has acknowledged this is cause for concern, in a recent Globe and Mail commentary written with other leading deep-learning experts: “There is one solution that will help keep the best minds in Canada, solve the current and future talent gap for domestic businesses, lure investment from foreign data-rich companies, and ensure Canada leads future AI breakthroughs: We must build a world-leading AI Institute in Toronto.” So it’s not insignificant that the Royal Bank of Canada’s Research in Deep Learning division—still shiny from its launch just seven months ago—has acquired the services of a big name in the field, adding Richard Sutton to its roster. Sutton wrote the book on the field of reinforcement learning, a technique which allows AI to teach itself what the best actions are using a reward-punishment system of its own, an area of deep learning that played a role in the success of DeepMind’s AlphaGo project. He will advise the group, currently based out of the University of Toronto, and also collaborate with RBC’s second AI research lab, which will be in Edmonton. “A lot of the development in deep learning came out of Canadian universities, yet the industry wasn’t positioned well enough to capitalize on that innovation, so we’ve lost a lot of people to south of the border,” said Foteini Agrafioti, who leads RBC’s deep-learning division. “That’s something we feel, as the biggest company in the country, we have the responsibility to invest in.” While Sutton is certainly not a household name, he is a major figure in deep learning, and a significant addition for a Canadian company nonetheless. Without a central hub for academics to branch out on their work in Canada, deep learning’s southbound pioneers served as pied pipers, bringing their students with them, creating a brain drain. Banking, too, seems to have plenty to offer deep-learning experts—in particular, rich historical data sets from decades of business. “The backbone of machine learning is data sets, and without that you’re really handcuffed. The bank has really interesting data sets from decades of market data that can be used to solve open problems right now,” says Agrafioti. Banking also offers some tantalizing practical applications for deep-learning innovators, too; of the three possibilities listed by Agrafioti—personalized AI-driven customer service, real-time fraud prevention and risk management—it’s the last one that might appeal most to those interested in industry disruption. Deep learning’s use of patterns to predict future activity appears to have tremendous potential for stock brokers, investment bankers, and asset managers—to assist them, at least for now. (For the record, Agrafioti demurs about the potential automation of those positions, rightly noting that there is no industry consensus on whether AI can ever truly become as or more powerful than the human brain.) It is, however, unclear if Canada’s banks—collectively the country’s largest companies—could reverse the tide of expertise migrating southward on their own. While the price tag of RBC’s investment in this lab is unclear, beyond Agrafioti’s cited cost of “tens of millions of dollars over the coming years,” Canada’s banks are unlikely to be able to match the dollar figures splashed around by companies like Tesla, which invested US$1 billion into Open AI in 2015. Canada’s Big Six banks themselves are less likely to feel the need to innovate, insulated as they are against the competitive agitation of fintech companies by their market position and regulatory bulwarks, and cognizant that Canada’s venture capitalism industry—usually the fuel for fintech—is far less fulsome than America’s. For these comfortable behemoth banks, the innovation stakes aren’t as high, a fact that Agrafioti acknowledges: “Our rate of adoption is, of course, not as fast as some tech companies.” Still, RBC deserves credit for at least pushing to develop more homegrown research. Scotiabank, CIBC, TD Canada Trust and Bank of Montreal were not able to respond at press time to requests for details about their own research into deep learning. (Scotiabank did, however, start a “digital factory” in 2015, which professed to partner with fintech startups to develop new technologies, and gifted the University of Toronto with $1.75 million to study “disruptive technologies,” while several big-bank CEOs acknowledged that AI needed to be harnessed within the industry at a recent conference.) But will it be enough to reverse the AI brain drain on its own? Surely not. The lure of money, vast data sets, and powerful computing in Silicon Valley remains a powerful pull for those at the peak of their profession. But if Canadian companies can learn anything from deep learning, it’s to take lessons from the many patterns of the past—struggles to innovate, and an inability to keep our best talent here—and project the right way forward in the future. And where better to start, than with the large data sets at the fingertips of our powerful banks?

Obviously, we don’t own smart people or their ideas; they may go where they’re most wanted and/or where opportunity awaits them. One might ask, in the days of Harpernomics what signal was sent by directing much of the investment capital (in some years the majority) and much of government research funding into raw resource extraction? What message did researchers working under government support take away from the muzzle? With Canadians being notable homers, it takes more than a little pressure to push them away; however, the ‘brain drain’ is hardly a new notion. Reply ↓ GeraldR on January 18, 2017 at 9:17 pm Canada should rise to this challenge by making it easier for our young people to obtain the appropriate training. Instead, Trudeau repeatedly talks about bringing in the “best and brightest” from other countries to fill our Universities and hi-tech job openings. It has probably never been harder for young Canadians to obtain higher education. Besides the steep financial cost, gaining admission to many fields is extremely difficult and student housing is in short supply. At UBC, for example, the Dean of Engineering has complained that they can only take 1 in 5 qualified applicants. Meanwhile the University touts the fact that a third of their student body is made up of foreign students and this is increasing rapidly. This is directly related to the underfunding of the University by government – UBC’s financial plan states that admissions of Canadian students to most faculties has been frozen and all increases in enrollment will be made up from foreign students, who pay higher tuition fees and can help make up budget shortfalls. Something is terribly wrong. Reply ↓ Olde Grouch on January 21, 2017 at 9:43 pm Cancel reply Sign in to comment. You're logged in as . Logout. Loading profile... Unexpected error. Please try again.

(ANTARA News/Ida Nurcahyani) Jakarta (ANTARA News) - Director General of Tax Ken Dwijugiasteadi gave an assurance on Wednesday that he would summon Google representatives to confirm data that it submitted regarding the companys revenue in Indonesia. "I have the data, so I will ask for their confirmation on whether the figures that they submitted are accurate," said Dwijugiasteadi. He did not mention when the summons would be made, but the agenda for the meeting has been decided due to Googles history of tax avoidance. The authorities have requested for a copy of electronic data relating to revenues from advertisements. He also hoped that Google will respond to the summons so the process of paying income tax on their revenues, which had already been significantly delayed, can be completed quickly. Dwijugiasteadi said that every company that operate and collect revenues in Indonesia are obliged to meet their tax obligations and contribute appropriately by paying the correct taxes to the state. "Regulations must be met and my job is to enforce them accordingly. I do not threaten or use force," he added. The head of the Jakarta regional office of the Directorate General of Tax, Muhammad Haniv, said that Google has yet to submit additional financial reports that they requested regarding revenue collected in Indonesia. "We cannot fully trust their statements as we are still waiting for further supporting documents. Their income from sources such as pay per click and other applications are yet to be accounted for," he added. He further questioned Googles reluctance to be listed as a permanent company in Indonesia as the company is already operating many of its servers in the country. "They already have servers in Indonesia. That is the physical evidence. Being permanently established requires a physical presence," said Haniv. According to the Directorate General of Tax, Google was registered as a legal entity in Indonesia at Tanah Abang Tax Office III in Central Jakarta as a foreign investment company in September 15, 2011 as subsidiary of Google Asia Pacific Ptd. Ltd. in Singapore. Based on Indonesian income tax law, Google must be declared as a permanent company and all its revenue or income within Indonesia must be taxed. However, Google has rejected further tax inspections from the authorities and it will not take the status of a permanent company, despite its revenue being in the trillions with the majority coming from advertisements.(*) Latest News CPO exit tax set at US$18 per ton 28th January 2017 Indonesia`s inflation estimated at 0.69 percent in January 27th January 2017 Indonesia accounts for 58 percent of sustainable palm oil production 26th January 2017 Chinese investment to continue to increase: BKPM head 26th January 2017 Investment realization reached Rp612.8 trillion in 2016 26th January 2017 BI predicts global crude prices to increase to US$47/barrel 26th January 2017 President Jokowi inaugurates Executive Leadership Program 25th January 2017 Indonesia conducive for economic growth: President 25th January 2017 www.antaranews.com Copyright © 2017 Latest News Top News National International Business Sports Entertainment Science/Tech Environment Feature TV Otomotif Bola Forum Pembaca Press Release Term Of Use About Us Network Guidelines Twitter Facebook RSS

Version 4.5 includes more than a dozen new shortcodes and widgets, along with revamped support for VideoPress. One of the most intriguing new features announced in this release, however, is the integration with WordAds, WordPress.com’s advertising program. Jetpack users are required to be on the Premium plan ($9.00/month or $99/year) in order to sign on with WordAds. The feature is then available within the Engagement tab along with settings for adjusting ad placement. Eligibility for WordAds was previously limited to sites that had thousands of page views per month, but this requirement is lifted for those who have purchased a Premium or Professional Jetpack plan. Unlike Adsense, which pays for clicks, WordAds pays based on the number of impressions combined with many other factors. According to Derek Springer, an Automattic employee who has worked on WordAds for several years, the traffic requirement was given to set earnings expectations and to ensure support resources were adequately available. How Much Can Publishers Earn through WordAds? It’s difficult to to gauge how much a publisher can earn using WordAds, and Automattic doesn’t publish any sample earnings. The WordAds network has more than 60 partners bidding for advertising space in realtime, including Google’s AdSense, Google, AdX, Facebook Ads, AOL, Yahoo, and Amazon. WordPress.com’s Daily Post blog likened the network to a stock market with prices rising and falling as available space changes. When asked about the average return for every 1,000 impressions, Derek Springer said it’s challenging to estimate due to the complex set of factors influencing the revenue publishers can earn. These include location and number of ads, geography of viewer, percentage of viewers with ad blockers, and other factors. “Generally speaking, a site with majority US views with high-quality content can expect to earn the most, while non-English language, low-quality (copied content, nsfw, spam, purchased traffic) sites can expect to earn very little (if anything),” Springer said. “Our network over the past year or so has gotten pretty good at appropriately rewarding high-quality sites with high-quality traffic (and penalizing the inverse).” For years, bloggers have traded stats and earning records, speculating on what influences WordAds’ unpredictable payouts. In 2014, the Human Breed Blog published a collection of data from blogs that made their WordAds earnings publicly available. The data demonstrated inconsistency in earnings for many publishers, including the author’s own blog, where earnings varied wildly from 2014-2015: My earnings have dropped down to half (From $22.55 in October 2014 to $11.77 in May 2015) despite my page views being higher than 20,000 views per month. The return per 1,000 Ad Impression (CPM) has dropped from $2.25 in October 2014 to $1.17 in May 2015 and the return per 1,000 Page views (CPV) has dropped from $1.39 in October 2014 to $0.51 in May 2015. The Human Breed Blog 2014-2015 WordAds Earnings This example is representative of the experience of many WordAds publishers in 2014-2016. “On my blog SQLwithManoj.com, for the months May, June, and July, the ‘Ad Impressions’ were around ~10k and earnings were in the range of $25 to $48 respectively each month,” said Manoj Pandey, blogger at SQLwithManoj.com. “But in the month of August the ‘Ad Impressions’ were showing ~100k, i.e. ~10 times the previous months, but earnings are still in the same range.” For many publishers participating in WordAds, there seems to be little correlation between impressions and payouts from month to month. Numerous publishers have reported progressively lower earnings despite having higher traffic numbers than previous months. Clarissa’s Blog, included in the collection of public earnings above, published stats from June 2014 to December 2015 that show a dramatic decrease in the amount paid for impressions. “You have no way of knowing where the ‘ad impressions’ figure comes from and why it varies from one month to another,” Clarissa said. “You will have to trust WordPress on that. I experimented with placing the maximum amount of ads as opposed to a moderate amount of ads and that had absolutely no impact on the number of ad impressions.” Things started changing in 2016 for Clarissa who now reports that earnings are increasing. “I have no idea why but the payments seem to have returned to the higher rates,” Clarissa said. “Right now is a good time to do WordAds.” Others continue to report declines on the WordPress.com forums as recently as this week. “I used to get $800 for 800K impressions,” said the owner of rebirthonlineworld.com. “A few months ago I got $100 for more than 2 million impressions. Last month, only $90 for 500K impressions. This is a big problem for me.” WordAds Vastly Overpaid for Low-Quality Traffic During Its First Years In 2013 WordAds paid out $1 million to publishers on its network. According to Derek Springer, earnings since then have been “pretty flat the past year” due to industry-wide declining ad rates. “We’ve been slowly clawing our way back from the trough of early 2015, which was a historical low for us,” Springer said. “So more folks were paid out, but rates as a whole were at their lowest point in 2015. We’ve been steadily increasing our rates and paying out less to low-quality content/traffic, so if you’re a high quality site it’s likely your rates haven’t fallen too much.” Behind the scenes, WordAds was quietly evolving its network to better distinguish sites that would deliver more value to its advertising partners, which accounts for many of the dramatic declines in earnings. “Pre-WordAds 2.0 our network didn’t have the precision to distinguish between high-quality and low-quality (spam, nsfw, bot views, etc) traffic and we had to make some coarse estimations on how to chop the earnings value up,” Springer said. “The net effect was that we vastly overpaid low-quality traffic for the first handful of years.” Since WordAds 2.0 the program is gotten better at paying users for high-quality content and traffic. The team has more information on the traffic the network is getting and buyers have more information about the content they are bidding on. “The net effect is that advertisers refuse to bid on low-quality content and traffic and those sites that were previously earning lots are now getting pennies on the dollar,” Springer said. “I would estimate that after investigation 95% of the time the folks complaining about low payout have something kinda scammy going on, usually copied content or paid traffic (and frequently both).” “Paid traffic” in this instance refers to users who have paid a service to send bots to a page to refresh constantly in order to artificially inflate pageviews. One recent highly publicized incident of this kind of fraud is a case where Russian hackers stole more than $3 million per day from video advertisers using nonhuman bot traffic. Similar tactics have been used on WordAds, motivated by a misconception that pageviews are equal to ad views. The Decline of the Advertising Industry Another factor contributing to lower earnings over the past few years is the general decline of the advertising industry. A 2015 Reuters Institute Digital News survey indicates that nearly half of US internet users have some form of ad blocking software installed. Reuters Institute’s latest predictions forecast a 24% increase in US users with ad blocking in 2017. Advertisers have to fight harder to get the attention of the remaining half of consumers and many companies have decided to allocate those funds elsewhere. According to the Interactive Advertising Bureau’s latest Internet Advertising Revenue report, search advertising on desktop declined for the first time in 2016, falling 12% to $8.9 billion. However, mobile advertising grew 105% from $3.6 billion to $7.4 billion. Mobile search is having an increasingly strong impact in shaping a site’s traffic. These factors are outside of WordAds’ control but they weigh heavily on how many impressions publishers will receive. If the vast majority of a site’s visitors are using ad-blockers and the site isn’t easily found via mobile search, it is likely to suffer earning declines on any ad network. “Ad rates industry wide have fallen over the past few years,” Springer said. “Ad buyers just aren’t paying what they used to and more users are using ad blockers. They heyday of the late aughts/early twenty-teens may never return as ad buyers realized they just aren’t getting the return they were expecting.” WordAds Needs More Transparency Around Partners and Reporting It is difficult for publishers to improve their strategies for generating ad revenue when earnings fluctuate wildly without any explanation beyond changes in advertising rates. After reviewing the product’s forums, many are requesting more transparency around why their earnings have dropped despite higher numbers of impressions. They want to know if advertising rates have dropped for the month, if partners have dropped out of the network, or if their content failed to connect with visitors on certain days. WordAds users have experienced problems with incorrect reporting, record low payouts, and blank banner displays. In the past there have also been considerable delays in publishers receiving their monthly earnings. Springer said improving the reporting process is a top priority for the team this year. “The flip-side/challenge of working with dozens of networks is that none of them pay us very consistently,” Springer said. “In the past there was no unified collection process on our end, so we would have to wait to collect from each partner and then split it up and send folks earnings out in one batch. However, for the past year and a half or so we’ve been working with a company called IPONWEB to unify our earnings, reporting, and ad buying process (this is what powers WordAds 2.0). We’re at the point where we can begin to provide closer to real-time earnings reporting.” Automattic is Optimistic about Expanding the WordAds Program with Jetpack The number of WordAds sites are up 111% year over year. WordAds currently has a few thousand self-hosted sites running AdControl/Jetpack Ads and Springer said the team is expecting that number to grow considerably now that integration has been added to Jetpack. The AdControl plugin is still available for non-Premium Jetpack users but the standard application and traffic requirements apply. Springer said they plan to phase out the plugin at some point in the future but there are no definite plans yet. “Tens of thousands of WP.com sites are approved WordAds (meaning they applied and were approved) out of many tens of thousands more total applications,” Springer said. “Additionally, every freemium WordPress.com site is running our ad network, though we naturally keep all the revenue from those sites.” With a gaggle of new publishers joining WordAds through Jetpack, one might imagine that rates and payouts for existing users would decrease as more advertising space becomes available. However, this isn’t how advertising networks work. “Generally speaking, advertisers want to display more ads than most publishers are able to provide (known as inventory), so adding more publishers/inventory to a network is a net benefit to advertisers and is what attracts the bigger, higher paying ad buyers,” Springer said. “If we can tell our ad partners ‘We have 10,000,000,000 pageviews available this month across our network,” then that attracts much more lucrative buyers than if a user has to try to attract them on their own. Advertisers also like that they can cut one deal for a million sites as opposed to having to cut them piecemeal and are generally willing to give us better deals. The whole ‘powers 27% of the web’ is a pretty tasty morsel for ad networks.” Advice for Publishers New to WordAds: Keep Expectations Realistic Seamless advertising is a major incentive for Jetpack users to sign up for the Premium plan, which also includes backups, one-click restores, security scanning, and 13GB video storage. The prospect of being able to flip the switch to turn on ads and potentially start earning money is very compelling, especially for users who have struggled with other forms of advertising that were not WordPress-compatible. The general outlook for WordAds is improving, as the product has evolved to reward higher quality content. As advertisers receive a better return on their investments, their confidence in bidding should increase. However, most publishers should expect to see fluctuations on earnings. WordPress.com’s Daily Post Blog advises new publishers to temper their expectations with the knowledge that they would need “hundreds of thousands of pageviews to generate meaningful earnings.” For most average bloggers, the ad revenue may not buy more than a decent cup of coffee. Mortiz Linder, an owner of traveluxblog.com, published his earnings and described his experience as “rather average.” “It’s a nice idea to gain something without effort, to get at least something back for all the work we put into traveluxblog each day,” Moritz said.

OKI Data Americas today launched two new printer models aimed at the small and midsized businesses with growing mobile and cloud print needs, the C532dn and MC573dn. Available today through channel partners, both models follow the company's focus on delivering printers that stand up needs of today's small businesses, according to Mark Hansinger, senior vice president of U.S. Sales for OKI Data Americas. "This isn't just office printing or printing that you do at home," he said during a media presentation. "They really need their output for something important." That print output can include invoices, presentations, marketing materials and other documents that SMBs need to conduct their daily business. Both the new C532dn color desktop printer and MC573dn color multifunction printer (MFP) use the company's LED print head technology. Compared to laser-based systems that use a mirror that shifts its position to allowing the laser to scan across a page, OKI's LED print heads are solid-state units. They contain no moving parts and span the complete width of a page, reducing wear on the printer. Both units have print speeds of 31 pages per minute in color and black and white. With optional trays, customers can stretch the printers' paper capacity to 1,410 sheets. An optional, user-installable wireless module provides WiFi connectivity. The MC573dn color MFP is equipped with a 7-inch touch screen that provides quick access apps and settings. Users can customize the screen to display commonly used apps and print functions. For IT personnel, the screen display provides step-by-step instructions on maintenance tasks. In terms of security, print jobs are sent and received over the network using IPSec (Internet Protocol Security) standard for encrypted communications. For added security, the Private Print feature can be used to release a print job after a user enters a PIN on the physical printer. Mirroring today's work forces, the printers are cloud- and mobile-enabled. The company supplies optional connectors for a variety of cloud-based productivity and document storage platforms including Microsoft Office 365, Google Drive and DropBox. Mobile users can print from their iOS devices and Android devices, courtesy of AirPrint and Google Cloud Print compatibility, respectively. Users can also elect to print with the company's own app for Android and iOS. New to the C532dn and MC573dn is support for Google Cloud Print 2.0, which offers a bandwidth-sparing feature called Local Mode. Schools and larger environments where Chromebooks are popular have experienced a brush with Google Cloud Print's downside, said OKI Data Americas technology manager Keith Fenton. "The only way to print with those Chromebooks is with Google Cloud Print," adding that all the print traffic generated by an organization's fleet of Chromebooks "goes through the Google Cloud" causing a wide range of issues. Fenton said that in some environments the technology causes networking issues and stokes security concerns among IT professionals. Some have struggled with managing the cloud print solution. Google Cloud Print 2.0's Local Mode "keeps all of that print traffic in your local environment, it never actually hits the cloud," Fenton said. "It addresses the security concerns and it addresses the bandwidth concerns of working through the cloud."           LATEST PC HARDWARE ARTICLES   For Intel in 2016, It Was a Very Good Year HPI Has Samsung-like Problem: Overheating Notebook Batteries Microsoft Challenges Chromebooks With New Windows 10 School PCs Google Says New Chromebook Models to Include Android Education Apps Apple Latest to 'Pile On' Qualcomm in Antitrust Lawsuits                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows Google Open Sources Data Visualization Tool for Machine Learning Cisco Security Business Group Continues to Accelerate Growth Amazon Go Won't Kill Many Jobs, But It May Prove a Boon to Crooks Microsoft, Harman Kardon to Take on Amazon Echo, Google Home Yahoo Suffers New Hack; 1 Billion Users Impacted This Time 10 Things T-Mobile Has Done to Move O...

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Features Reviews Search Subscribe Mobile Technology HTC U Ultra vs. Google Pixel XL Will ShanklinJanuary 19th, 2017 22 pictures New Atlas compares the features and specs of the upcoming HTC U Ultra and Google Pixel XLView gallery - 22 images While Google took all the credit, the company's Pixel and Pixel XL were manufactured by HTC. How does HTC's silent-partner gig stack up next to the company's upcoming 2017 flagship, the U Ultra? Size The HTC U Ultra is 5-percent taller and wider, and 10-percent thicker than the Google Pixel XL. Weight Weights are very similar. Build HTC is taking a page from Samsung's design playbook, with a glass/aluminum design that looks almost exactly like the Galaxy S6 edge+ or Galaxy S7 edge. Colors You have three colors to choose from for each phone. Display size HTC's display comes out 7-percent bigger, in terms of area. Display resolution Both have sharp QHD resolution, but the smaller Pixel XL has a slightly-higher pixel density. Display type HTC is using a Super-LCD 5 panel (an IPS LCD that eliminates the air gap between display and glass), while Google uses OLED. Second screen While the Ultra's back looks like a Samsung copy, the second screen on its front, above the main display, makes its face look like an LG copy. Like the V20, this strip of screen is home to notifications and shortcuts. Headphone jack HTC is joining the trend of cutting the headphone jack from its latest flagship. Its 2016 flagship hung its hat on its hi-fi capabilities, but it's unlikely the jackless U Ultra will continue to please audiophiles – leaving LG and Sony as the top smartphone-maker picks in that category. Processor While the Snapdragon 821 isn't exactly outdated, it's a late-2016 processor showing up in HTC's early-2017 phone. We would bet its launch-window rivals, the (expected) Galaxy S8 and LG G6, will have the updated Snapdragon 835. RAM RAM is even, at 4 GB a pop. Storage Google offers two storage tiers, maxing out higher, but HTC's only tier offers a generous 64 GB. MicroSD The U Ultra also adds expandable storage. Battery Considering it has a power-hungry QHD display, the U Ultra has a relatively small battery compared to its peers. Camera megapixels We'll have to test the U Ultra's camera to know if it stacks up to the Pixel's, but that will be a tall order: The Pixel phones are our current picks for the best photography in mobile. Camera aperture (rear) Never mind Google's narrower aperture, as its algorithms still give it the best low-lit shots you'll take with a smartphone today. Again, though, we'll have to test the Ultra's camera before having anything to say about it. OIS Google also left out Optical Image Stabilization, another sign that its photo-processing software is voiding the need for key camera-hardware features. Fingerprint sensor The Ultra has a home-button fingerprint sensor, while the Pixel's is on its backside. Software The Pixel XL runs stock Android Nougat, while the U Ultra will launch with an HTC-skinned variant of Nougat. The Pixel, however, will receive future Android updates almost immediately; don't expect that for the Ultra. Release HTC made the odd move of announcing its 2017 flagship two months before it starts shipping. Consumers like near-instant gratification: It's hard to see this as a formula for success. The U Ultra is also going to be sold online-only (and GSM only, meaning no Verizon or Sprint support), illustrating how far HTC's smartphone-industry star has fallen. Its flagships were once carried – and marketed – on all the major carriers. Today the struggling company seems more invested in VR. Starting price (full retail) The Ultra rings up for $20 less than the Pixel, though that includes double the internal storage and a microSD slot. Still, based on the spec sheet, it's hard to recommend jumping on the U Ultra. By the time it ships, the Galaxy S8 and LG G6 will likely be already here or coming soon: With an obsolete processor at launch, no more hi-fi-audio focus and at least two copycat design features, does HTC's flagship have enough going for it to forge a strong identity of its own? For more, you can read New Atlas' initial coverage of the HTC U Ultra, along with our review of the Pixel XL.

Its head-mounted display (HMD) is wrapped in a comfy fabric texture, with squishy foam on the inside. The head strap is easy to adjust. It's ergonomically ideal and a little, invisible chip connects it to the Google Pixel phone with no effort. Tech outlets have sung the Daydream HMD's praises since the hardware's November release. But its best asset — its controller — has flown under the radar. I picked up one of these babies last night and spent some time testing out the remote. It is a very well-designed thing that I love and it deserves a closer look. The Daydream's controller is a wireless, ovular remote with four buttons: A circle and minus button on the flat top, a large trackpad button above it and, on the remote's side, a volume button. The trackpad is all-directions responsive, so you can swipe from left to right to scroll through options, or swipe diagonally to, say, throw a stick to a dog. The Samsung Gear VR, maybe the most comparable VR hardware since it's also for mobile, is controlled by a pad on the side of the controller. After significant time playing, your arm can tire of making adjustments by your head — it doesn't welcome extended periods in VR. Other controllers are compatible with it, like full two-handed gamepads and a one-handed remote with a D pad, but while they have a lot of options, none quite approach the Daydream remote's simple/effective ratio. The Oculus's remote control is most similar to the Daydream's, with two medium-sized buttons in the middle and a large one on top. It isn't a trackpad, but a D-pad with four directions. On either side of the middle buttons are plus and minus buttons. I appreciated that the Daydream relegated those to the side of the controller, since in VR, it can be hard to feel out which button your finger is on when they're all cluttered together on the front. The very fact of a one-handed remote instead of a two-handed game controller (or controllers) is significant. It has the same welcoming quality as a Wiimote, definitely unintimidating to non-gamers. A one-handed remote also invites more relaxed postures while you're playing, since your elbows aren't locked. It's very nice for using VR in bed. After a while, it feels like nothing, since it's so light. The controller also reports gyroscopic and accelerometric readings. So, for example, I played action RPG Twilight Pioneers on Daydream last night (yes, in bed). My remote was a sword, which I could slash by waving the controller around in any direction. It moved faster or slower depending on how quickly I waved the remote. More practical, these measurement tools mean that the controller can help make VR work better: When you point ahead and hold the circle button, the Daydream's viewpoint will readjust to reflect where you're facing, something I've found immensely frustrating with other VR hardware. It's easy and surprisingly accurate for a relatively inexpensive controller (the Gear VR HMD is $119). This is a sleek thing, friends. But versatile, considering it only has four buttons. As a noted VR sceptic, I was surprised at how the controller's simplicity made the hardware feel less gimmicky. The Daydream's remote (and by extension, the HMD) feels more like a tool than a commodity, since it's polished but also designed to be totally accessible to real people and not just tech geeks. It's definitely a step forward for a genre of hardware that, in my experience, a lot of game-players still consider very niche. Unfortunately, one thing I discovered with my new Google Daydream is that there's a regrettable dearth of software for it. None of the three titles I chose from the Google store blew me away as much as the hardware did. When something comes along that really utilises the remote, maybe I'll stop laughing every time I hear the word "immersive". Maybe. Comments scarnon @scarnon Jan 19, 2017, 4:40pm When I first got Gear VR I was disappointed that so many games required controllers and it didnt come with one. A bit of playing around I was able to sync my DS4 to my Note 5 and worked awesomely as a controller for all VR games. Not as sleek and versatile as this but for a PS gamer it had its benefits!!!

Terms of the deal were not announced. Twitter last year was in talks to sell itself with several firms including Google parent Alphabet, but without a deal decided to continue on an independent path, cutting jobs and refocusing on its core services. The sale of Fabric will shift to Google the platform used by developers for mobile apps. “When we launched Fabric in 2014, our goal was to provide the best tools to help developers create amazing apps,” the Fabric team said in a blog post. “Today we enter the next chapter for Fabric and are pleased to announce that we’ve signed an agreement for Fabric to be acquired by Google and for our team to join Google’s Developer Products Group, working with the Firebase team.” Google Firebase product manager Francis Ma said buying Fabric will “continue the great work that Twitter put into the platform,” adding that “our missions align closely: help developers build better apps and grow their business.” Twitter has been in a reorganisation phase as it seeks to hit profitability for the first time, and to boost user growth which has been stagnating in comparison with other social networks. — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week New wave of robots set to deliver the goods Google, Facebook reflect tech dismay on Trump immigration order Battle of the digital butlers: Alexa takes on Siri (VIDEO) In move to Facebook, Barra leaves unfinished expansion at Xiaomi Apple joins group devoted to keeping AI nice Samsung confirms battery defects caused Note 7 fires (VIDEO) Samsung Galaxy S8 rumours: Smaller case, more screen real estate Zuckerberg says Facebook hired ex-Xiaomi VP Barra as new VR head Panasonic launches washing machine for curry stains in India How fat do cameras make you look?

The Court did not issue a written decision explaining its reasoning or that the Company's arguments were not correct; however, we believe that their decision was predicated on the fact that as co-owners of the patents with Vedanti, we can simply refile together against Google. The Court also issued an order denying Google's motion arguing that the Company's appeal should be dismissed as moot. In November 2016, MAXD took the necessary steps to protect itself from such an outcome by entering into the agreement with Vedanti Licensing Limited ("VLL") and Vedanti Systems Limited ("Vedanti") under (the "VLL/Max Sound Agreement") granting the Company co-ownership of U.S. Patent No. 7,974,339 (the "`339 Patent") in the event the appeal was not successful. Thus, MAXD will now become a co-owner with VLL of the `339 Patent and, pursuant to the VLL/Max Sound Agreement, the Company and VLL intend to file a new lawsuit against Google for infringement as co-owners. The Court's decision does not have any affect on the merits of the infringement claims against Google and we intend to file a stronger claim vigorously enforcing the rights of our intellectual property.

Protests the day after inauguration, like the viral Women's March, seem to be getting a whole lot more attention than the official presidential inauguration, according to Google Trends. Image: mark makela/ Getty Images By Marissa Wenzke2017-01-19 01:23:05 UTC Donald Trump will soon be sworn in as the 45th president of the United States of America. But it looks like, once again, people seem to care more about the protests against Trump than the celebration of his coming presidency. In more than half the country, Google searches for "inauguration protests" outperformed searches for "attend inauguration," according to data from Google Trends. Searches for those phrases could mean any number of things, but it's just one more indicator of just how strong the collective opposition to Trump really is. SEE ALSO: Trump is using Facebook ads to unload Inauguration tickets A map of the compiled data shows that a healthy majority of the country is more interested in the protests — 31 states are googling the protests more than the actual inauguration in past seven days. Meanwhile, just 17 states had people searching "attend inauguration" more often. As the map shows, Americans' interest in the anti-Trump protests is not reserved to the liberal enclaves of the urban coastlines. Rather, a number of states in the Rust Belt and other Trump-won parts of the U.S. were more curious about the protests than the inauguration, according to the Google searches of those states' residents. Nearly half of the states that Trump won searched more often for the phrase "inauguration protests" than "attend inauguration," in the past seven days. The most searched questions on Google paint a similar picture — it seems most Americans care (or at least google) more about the opposition than the coming presidency. The most searched question related to the inauguration is "Who is boycotting the inauguration?", followed by some other basic questions and, of course, the fifth most searched question — which reveals just how confusing all this talk about an unfamiliar eight-letter word must be to quite a few people. On a broader scale, the political issues most concerning to Americans are not what they always were. The 2008 economic recession made jobs and the economy the biggest issue for Americans for quite a while. But recent Google searches show Russia has come to be the dominating topic, followed by immigration, Obamacare, jobs, and ISIS. U.S. relations with Russia and the broader issue of immigration once again topped off people's biggest questions, as shown by the top Trump-related searches. And given that intelligence dossier revealing a whole plethora of explosive but unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia, many Americans are dying to know more about the country. More specifically, their top questions ask what exactly the nature of Russia's relationship with our next president is, and of course, how they may have helped elect him.

Panoramics Photos Rec.humor.funny Joke Site Robocar Bog Twitter Best of Blog Brad's Home Robocars.com Home » Topic » Robocars Rodney Brooks on Pedestrian Interaction, Andrew Ng on Infrastructure, and both on human attitudes Submitted by brad on Mon, 2017-01-16 22:08. Robocars Recently we’ve seen two essays by people I highly respect in the field of AI and robotics. Their points are worthy of reading, but in spite of my respect, I have some differences of course. The first essay comes from Andrew Ng, head of AI (and thus the self-driving car project) at Baidu. You will find few who can compete with Andrew when it comes to expertise on AI. (Update: This essay is not recent, but I only came upon it recently.) In Wired he writes that Self-Driving Cars Won’t Work Until We Change Our Roads—And Attitudes. And the media have read this essay as being much more strong about changing the roads than he actually writes. I have declared it to be the “first law of robocars” that you don’t change the infrastructure. You improve your car to match the world you are given, you don’t ask the world to change to help your cars. There are several reasons I promote this rule: As soon as you depend on a change in the world in order to drive safely, you have vastly limited where you can deploy. You declare that your technology will be, for a very long time, a limited area technology. You have to depend on, and wait for others to change the world or their attitudes. It’s beyond your control. When it comes to cities and infrastructure, the pace of change is glacial. When it comes to human behaviour, it can be even worse. While it may seem that the change to infrastructure is clearer and easier to plan, the reality is almost assuredly the opposite. That’s because the clever teams of developers, armed with the constantly improving technologies driven by Moore’s law, have the ability to solve problems in a way that is much faster than our linear intuitions suggest. Consider measuring traffic by installing tons of sensors, vs. just getting everybody to download Waze. Before Waze, the sensor approach seemed clear, if expensive. But it was wrong. As noted, Andrew Ng does not actually suggest that much change to the infrastructure. He talks about: Having road construction crews log changes to the road before they do them Giving police and others who direct traffic a more reliable way to communicate their commands to cars Better painting of lane markers More reliable ways to learn the state of traffic lights Tools to help humans understand the actions and plans of robocars Logging construction The first proposal is one I have also made, because it’s very doable, thanks to computer technology. All it requires at first blush is a smartphone app in the hands of construction crews. Before starting a project, they would know that just as important as laying out cones and signs is opening the app and declaring the start of a project. The phone has a GPS and can offer a selection of precise road locations and log it. Of course, the projects should be logged even before they begin, but because that’s imperfect, smartphone logging is good enough. You could improve this by sticking old smartphones in all the road construction machines (old phones are cheap and there are only so many machines) so that any time a machine stops on a road for very long, it sends a message to a control center. Even emergency construction gets detected this way. Even with all that, cars still need to detect changes to the road (that’s easy with good maps) and cones and machines. Which they can do. Police redirection I think the redirection problem is more difficult. Many people redirect traffic, even civilians. However, I would be interested to see Ng’s prediction on how hard it is to get neural network based recognizers to understand all the common gestures. Considering that computers are now getting better at reading sign languages, which are much more complex, I am optimistic here. But in any event, there is another solution for the cases where the system can’t understand the advice, namely calling in an operator in a remote control center, which is what Nissan plans to do, and what we do at Starship. Unmanned cars, with no human to help, will just avoid data dead zones. If somehow they get to them, there can be other solutions, which are imperfect but fine when the problem is very rare, such as a way for the traffic manager to speak to the car (after all, spoken language understanding is now close to a solved problem for limited vocabulary problems.) Better lanes Here I disagree with Andrew. His statement may be a result of efforts to drive on roads without maps, even though Baidu has good map expertise. Google’s car has a map of the texture of the road. It knows where the cracks and jagged lane markers are. The car actually likes degrading lane markers. It’s perfectly painted straight and smooth roads which confuse it (though only slightly, and not enough to cause a problem.) So no, I think that better line painting is not on the must-do list. Seeing lights He’s right, seeing lights can be challenging, though the better cars are getting good at it. The simple algorithm is “you don’t go if you don’t confirm green.” That means you don’t run a red but you could block traffic. If that’s very rare it’s OK. We can consider infrastructure to solve that, though I’m wary. Fortunately, if the city is controlling its lights with a central computer, you don’t have to alter the traffic light itself (which is hard,) you can just query the city, in those rare cases, for when the light will be changing. I think that problem will be solved, but I also think it may well be solved just by better cameras. Good robocars know exactly where all the lights are, and they know where they are, and thus they know exactly what pixels in a video image are from the light, even if the sun is behind it. (Good robocars also know where the sun is and will avoid stopping in a place where there is no light they can see without the sun right behind it.) Working with people How cars interact with people is one of Andrew Ng’s points and the central point of Rodney Brooks’ essay Unexpected Consequences of Self Driving Cars. Already many of the car companies have had fun experimenting with that, putting displays on the outside of cars of various sorts. While cars don’t have the body language and eye contact of human drivers, I don’t predict a problem we can’t solve with good effort. Brooks’ credentials are also superb, as founder of iRobot (Roomba) and Rethink Robotics (Baxter) as well as many accomplishments as an MIT professor. His essay delves into one of the key questions I have wondered about for some time — how to deal with a world where things do not follow the rules, and where there are lots of implicit and changing rules and interactions. Google discovered the first instant of this when their car got stuck at a 4 way stop by being polite. They had to program the car to assert its right to go in order to handle the stop. Likewise, you need to speed to be a good citizen on many of our roads today. His key points are as follows: There is a well worked out dance between pedestrians and cars, that varies greatly among different road types, with give and take, and it’s not suitable for machines yet. People want to know a driver has seen them before stepping near or certainly in front of a vehicle. People jaywalk, and even expect cars to stop for them when they do on some streets. In snowy places, people walk on the street when the sidewalk is not shoveled. Foot traffic can be so much that timid cars can’t ever get out of sidestreets or driveways. Nice pedestrians often let them out. They will hand signal their willingness to yield or use body language. Sometimes people just stand at the corner or edge of the road, and you can’t tell if they are standing there or getting ready to cross. People setting cars to circle rather than park People might jump out of their car to do something, leaving it in the middle of the street blocking traffic, where today they would be unwilling to double park. People might abuse parking spots by having a car “hold” them for quick service when they want to leave an event. Cars will grab early spots to pick up children at schools. Brooks starts with one common mistake — he has bought into the “levels” defined by SAE, even claiming them to be well accepted. In fact, many people don’t accept them, especially the most advanced developers, and I outlined recently why there is only one level, namely unmanned operation, and so the levels are useless as a taxonomy. Instead the real taxonomy in the early days will be the difference between mobility on demand services (robotaxi) and self-drive enabled high end luxury cars. Many of his problems involve privately owned cars and selfish behaviour by their owners. Many of those behaviours don’t make sense in a world with robotaxis. I think it’s very likely that the robotaxis come first, and come in large numbers first, while some imagine it’s the other way around. Unintended consequences Brooks is right that there will be unintended consequences, and the technology will be put to uses nobody thought of. People will be greedy, and antisocial, that can be assured. Fortunately, however, people will work out solutions, in advance, to anything you can think of or notice just by walking down the street or thinking about issues for a few days. The experienced developers have been thinking about these problems for decades now, and cars like Google’s have driven for 300 human lifetimes of driving, and that number keeps increasing. They note every unusual situation they encounter on every road they can try to drive, and the put it into the simulator if it’s important. They’ve already seen more situations than any one human will encounter on those roads, though they certainly haven’t driven all the types of road in the world. But they will, before they certify as safe for deployment on such roads. As I noted, only the “level 4” situation is real. Level 5 is an aspirational science-fiction goal, and the others are unsafe. Key to the improved thinking on “levels” it is no longer the amount of human supervision needed that makes the difference, it is the types of roads and situations you can handle. All these vehicles will only handle a subset of roads, and that is what everybody plans. If there is a road that is too hard, they just won’t drive it. Fortunately, there are lots of road subsets out there that are very, very useful and make economic sense. For a while, many companies planned only to do highways, which are the simplest road subset of all, except for the speed. A small subset, but everybody agrees it’s valuable. So the short answer is, solutions will be found to these problems if the roads they occur on are commercially necessary. If they are not necessary, the solutions will be delayed until they can be found, though that’s probably not too long. As noted above, many people do expect systems to be developed to allow dialogue between robocars and pedestrians or other humans. One useful tool is gaze detection — just as a cheap flash camera causes “red eye” in photos, machines shining infrared light can easily tell if you are looking at them. Eye contact in that direction is detectable. There have been various experiments in sending information in the reverse direction. Some cars have lasers that can paint lines on the road. Others can display text. Some have an LED ribbon surrounding them that shows all the objects and people tracked by the car, so people can understand that they are being perceived. You can also flash a light back directly at people to return their eye contact — I see you and I see that you saw me. Over time, we’ll develop styles of communication, and they will get standarized. It’s not essential to do that on day one; you just stay on the simpler roads until you know you can handle the others. Private cars will pause and pop out a steering wheel. Services like Uber will send you a human driver in the early days if the car is going somewhere the systems can’t drive, or they might even let you drive part of it. Such incrementalism is the only way it can ever work. People taking advantage of timidity of robocars I believe there are solutions to some of the problems laid out. One I have considered is pedestrians and others who take advantage of the naturally conservative and timid nature of a robocar. If people feel they can safely cut off or jaywalk in front of robocars, they will. And the unmanned cars will mostly just accept that, though only about 10% of all cars should be unmanned at any given time. The cars with passengers are another story. Those passengers will be bothered if they are cut off, or forced to brake quickly. They will spill their coffee. And they will fight back. Citizen based strong traffic code enforcement Every time you jump in front of such a car, it will of course have saved the video and other sensor data. It’s always doing that. But the passenger might tell the car, “Please save that recent encounter. E-mail it to the police.” The police will do little with it at first, but in time, especially since there are rich people in these cars, they will throw a face recognizer and licence plate recognizer on the system that gets the videos. They will notice that one person keeps jaywalking right in front of the cars and annoying the passengers. Or the guy who keeps cutting off the cars as though they are not there because they always brake. They will have video of him doing it 40 times, or 100. And at that point, they will do something. The worst offender will get identified and get an E-mail from police. We have 50 videos of you doing this. Here are 50 tickets. Then the next, and the next until nobody wants to get to the top of the list. This might actually create pressure the other way — a street that belongs only to the cars and excludes the non-car user. A traffic code that is enforced to the letter because every person inconvenienced has an ability to file a complaint trivially. We don’t want that either, but we can control that balance. I actually look forward to fixing one of the dynamics of jaywalking that doesn’t work. Often, people like to jaywalk and a car is approaching. They want to have the car pass at full speed and then walk behind it — everybody is more comfortable behind a car than in front of one. But the driver gets paranoid and stops, and eventually you uncomfortably cross in front, annoyed at that and that you stopped somebody you didn’t intend to stop. I suspect robocars will be able to handle this dynamic better, predicting when people might actually be on a path to enter their lane, but not slowing down for stopped pedestrians (adults at least) and trust them to manage their crossing. Children are a different matter. People being selfish with robocars Brooks wonders about people doing selfish things with their robocars. Here, he mostly talks about privately owned robocars, since most of what he describes would not or could not happen with a robotaxi. There will be some private cars so we want to think about this. A very common supposition I see here and elsewhere is the idea of a car that circles rather than parking. Today, operating a car is about $20/hour so that’s already completely irrational, and even when robocar operation drops to $8/hour or less, parking is going to be ridiculously cheap and plentiful so that’s not too likely. There could be competition for spots in very busy areas (schools, arenas etc.) which don’t have much space for pick-up and drop-off, and that’s another area where a bit of traffic code could go a long way. Allow facilities to make a rule: “No car may enter unless its passenger is waiting at the pick-up spot” with authority to ticket and evict any car that does otherwise. Over time, such locations will adjust their pick-up spots to the robocar world and become more like Singapore’s airport, which provides amazing taxi throughput with no cab lines by making it all happen in parallel. Of course, cars would wait outside the zone but robocars can easily double and triple park without blocking the cars they sit in the path of. Robocars waiting for passengers at busy locations will be able to purchase waiting spaces for less than the cost of circling, and then serve their customers or owners. If necessary, market prices can be put on the prized close waiting spaces to solve any problems of scarcity. So when can it happen? Robocars will come to different places at different times. They will handle different classes of streets at different times. They will handle different types of interactions with pedestrians and other road users at different times. Where you live will dictate when you can use it and how you can use it. Vendors will push at the most lucrative routes to start, then work down. There will be many problems that are difficult at first, and the result will be the early cars just don’t go on those sorts of streets or into those sorts of situations. Human driving, either by the customer or something like an Uber driver, will fill in the gaps. Long before then, teams will have encountered or thought of just about any situation you’ve seen, and any situation you’ve likely thought of in a short amount of time. They will have programmed every variation of that situation they can imagine into their simulators to see what their car does. They will use this to grow the network of roads the cars handle every day. Even if at the start, it is not a network of use to you, it won’t be too long before it becomes that, at first for some of your rides, and eventually for most or all. » brad's blog Bicycle use Submitted by Russell de Silva (not verified) on Wed, 2017-01-18 12:15. I'm hopeful that if robocar interactions with pedestrians and cyclists prove to be safer than those driven by humans, then we will see a big surge in bicycle use for short trips. I have at various times commuted by bike to work, but by far the biggest turn off is the lack of safety. While the benefits to the environment of one less car will be greatly reduced if very small and low performance electric vehicles become the norm, the fitness benefits are obvious. One downside to this might be that bicycle use becomes so common that they impede robocar transport especially before and after school. Add in the advent of e-bikes and commuting by bike over larger distances becomes more attractive. It will be interesting to see if any of this comes to pass. » reply Bike is helped Submitted by brad on Wed, 2017-01-18 18:04. Well, it’s a long time before the human drivers are off the road, many decades at least, so you won’t feel perfectly safe for a while. But one big plus is the ability to easily mix bike and car, with or without robot delivered bikes: Take a car one way and return by bicycle. (Either one way rental bike or bike that came in the car to give you that option.) Ride car into town. Stop part way and finish trip on bike, either for exercise or because traffic is heavy and bike will be faster or pay fewer road tolls. Ditto in reverse. Ride from work until tired, then summon car on phone, which pulls up next to you (tracking as you bike) and then you (and the bike, possibly) get into the car, which is designed with a rack. Also possible to use e-bikes for super energy efficiency and pleasant rides on nice days » reply Classes of streets Submitted by cxed (not verified) on Fri, 2017-01-20 23:22. "They will handle different classes of streets at different times." I have always disagreed with your assertion that computer drivers must be able to drive like human drivers. I believe that is a false hope. It reminds me of orinthopters - seems like a "natural" idea but ultimately not a good one, to chase evolution. But perhaps our opinions will converge with the "classes of streets" idea. Eventually there must be an equilibrium where the last .001% of humanness AI designers are trying to impart to the cars is more expensive than just replacing those roads still classified as problematic. » reply Like human drivers Submitted by brad on Sat, 2017-01-21 04:50. Where do you think I said computer drivers must drive like human ones? I have never said that. I (and many others) have said they should be able to attain a safety record, in their operating domain, that is at least as good as human records, and probably better. » reply Perhaps I misunderstand Submitted by cxed (not verified) on Sat, 2017-01-21 08:50. This may be an incorrect interpretation, but when I see something like this... "I have declared it to be the “first law of robocars” that you don’t change the infrastructure." ...I can only conclude that cars need to get along as well with what we've got as humans. Maybe you can better clarify how cars will be able to deal with human infrastructure if we agree that strong AI to drive cars is not right around the corner. My belief is that very small enhancements to the infrastructure could save enormous AI R&D. Throughout history we've made massive changes to infrastructure if the payoff is good (and for autonomous cars it is). The amount and pace of change needed to allow cars at all (say, from 1925 to 1975) is far greater and faster than anything that would need to be done to completely solve autonomous driving. New topic: I'm curious about your opinion of Udacity's nanodegree in "autonomous car engineering". Thanks. » reply Small changes Submitted by brad on Sun, 2017-01-22 07:45. Even the most tiny of changes to infrastructure take many decades to become universal. The progress in AI is much faster. Nothing here involves strong AI. Certainly being able to handle missing lane lines or strange signal arrangements or odd signs even comes close to that. The answer is mapping. Cars drive the roads (driven by humans and later by software.) Weak AI turns the scans into maps. Live human beings review the maps and data to deal with situations that software can’t handle. If such situations are few, the cost is very reasonable, but even if humans have to review every inch it is still cheaper than changing the infrastructure. And much faster, with no waiting for municipalities to get it done. It’s cheaper to map any road than to physically alter it. It’s easy for the system to see if the real road differs from the map. There the car can rely on its driving ability without an accurate map, or call on help from passengers, or call on help from a remote operations center, or pull off the road if it’s unmanned, in a radio dead zone and the first such car to encounter the changed road. Such situations should be very rare. » reply Infrastructure changes Submitted by SEK (not verified) on Mon, 2017-01-23 07:29. Brad, I see at least two drivers to gradual infrastructure changes: - There will always be a push for even safer transportation. Every life lost in one too much. Infrastructure changes that demonstrates to increase safety will be gradually implemented. This will probably happen in the next decades in parallel to AVs adoption. - The expansion of ODDs can be accelerated by infrastructure changes. E.g. that street that is out of ODD in the sunset hours may adopt a connected traffic light if it will change the ODD status and better serve consumers in that area. Living in region with harsh winters, I'm always wondering about ODDs in snow storm days and the commercial viability of AVs if all snow days are out of ODDs. May be infrastructure changes could expand ODDs in this case. » reply Gradual implementation Submitted by brad on Mon, 2017-01-23 15:25. Sure, they might happen, but the problem is this. A car either meets the bar of “safe enough” on the roads or it doesn’t. Safe enough is still not perfect, so there is always room for improvement, and people should work on those improvements. But you create the risk that people will say, “The cars are not safe enough unless they infrastructure meets this standard.” If so, you get cars that can only drive where you have improved the infrastructure. Which are essentially useless cars, or 1% of the utility of cars that can go most places. And they save 1% of the lives. Now the first cars will not go everywhere because they won’t handle every type of road. But it will be the builders of the car making that decision, and doing the effort to improve it. You don’t want a situation where you say, “Cars can’t go on a road until we repaint the stripes” because now you must wait for every local government to repaint the stripes. If you say, “Cars can’t go on a road until the maker of the car builds a driving system able to handle the badly painted stripes” then it’s up to the competing companies to solve the problem. And they solve it 10 times faster than the governments, and they solve it everywhere they compete. If you want to talk about a situation where the cars can handle 99% of the roads, and there is a 1% section where infrastructure improvements might gradually appear, that’s a little more workable. That would not apply to roads, but an example might be traffic lights. A car might be able to read 99% of traffic lights, but some might be arranged so poorly that the car can’t be sure it is reading the light properly. There, you could tell the cities, “please fix this traffic light, or make its state available over the internet” and wait for the city to do that. (But you would still be trying to see if you can improve the car to see the bad traffic light anyway.) There are two kinds of changes cities might do, though. The hardest is physical changes that need bureaucracy and money. Those will always be slow. Other changes are to virtual infrastructure, and can be funded by the car companies, who have the motive to do it. For example, if the change desired is the one that Andrew Ng (and I) have both suggested, that construction crews log in a database before they open up a construction site, that’s not too bad because the work is virtual — provide the cities with a mobile phone app and database that the crews can use. Even give them phones if need be. All the city has to do is make a law, and get the construction crews to add “log the opening of the site” in the checklist they already have for the procedures on starting road construction. » reply Level 4 Autonomy? Submitted by Alan Little (not verified) on Tue, 2017-01-24 03:25. So ... humans with little or no experience or practice at driving only get to practice driving on a dirt road in a blizzard? That's going to work well. Actually, the most terrified I've ever been driving was on an autobahn in Austria in a thunderstorm. Visibility was so bad I wanted to pull over but I couldn't see where the side of the road was, and I was driving so slowly I was scared of somebody rear-ending me. An autonomous car with radar, not dependent on vision alone, would have been far better equipped to be safe in that severe weather situation. » reply Only practice in bad situations Submitted by brad on Tue, 2017-01-24 08:32. It is the expectation of many that the period where the cars can’t handle tough conditions is not a very long one, so we don’t have the time to breed a generation of drivers who have no experience and are called upon only when it is difficult. » reply Comment viewing options Flat list - collapsedFlat list - expandedThreaded list - collapsedThreaded list - expanded Date - newest firstDate - oldest first 10 comments per page30 comments per page50 comments per page70 comments per page90 comments per page150 comments per page200 comments per page250 comments per page300 comments per page Select your preferred way to display the comments and click "Save settings" to activate your changes.

Faces a New Threat to the iPhone 8 (AAPL) The Essential smartphone from Android co-founder Andy Rubin could rain on the iPhone 8 parade this year By Brad Moon, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Jan 17, 2017, 10:06 am EST     View All   Popular Posts: Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone Takes a Hit From … Netflix, Inc.? (NFLX) 10 Companies That Are Bringing Jobs Back to America Is Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Ending the Age of Intel (INTC)? Recent Posts: Samsung (SSNLF) Expected to Launch Galaxy S8 on March 29 Facebook Inc (FB) Hires Former Google Exec to Lead Oculus Is Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Ending the Age of Intel (INTC)? View All Posts Apple inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is all too familiar with Andy Rubin. The creator of Android led the effort to knock iOS off its perch and take a commanding lead in the smartphone platform wars. With a critical iPhone 8 release scheduled for 2017, Rubin is once again poised to be a thorn in AAPL’s side with news he is preparing to launch his own Essential smartphone. Source: Global Playground If the new AI-powered, flagship smartphone from Rubin’s company lives up to the hype, the Samsung (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) Galaxy S8 and the next Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Pixel Phone may be the least of Apple’s worries this year. Re-Introducing Andy Rubin A one-time Apple engineer, Andy Rubin quickly became a serious threat to the company’s mobile ambitions. In 2003, he co-founded Android. When Alphabet’s Google bought the mobile operating system in 2005, he became the Google senior vice president responsible for Android. Rubin continued in the position until 2013, when he took over Google’s robotics division before leaving the company altogether in 2014. Now, Rubin is back in the spotlight with his own company — Essential — which is focused on artificial intelligence. And it features a flagship smartphone as its product centerpiece. The Essential Smartphone Bloomberg was the first to report on Andy Rubin’s new company after CES 2017. According to Bloomberg, Rubin is in discussion with mobile carriers, including Sprint Corp (NYSE:S), about the Essential smartphone. The device is still in the prototype stage, but sources say Rubin is planning to launch it by the middle of the year, at a $649 price point. That would mean a new flagship smartphone hitting shelves just months before the iPhone 8. It would add to the tough competition of the Galaxy S8, which will be heavily promoted by Samsung, as well as the follow-up version of Google’s Pixel Phone. The Essential smartphone may pose an even bigger threat to the iPhone 8 than these two Android front-runners. Bloomberg’s sources describe a smartphone with a larger display than the iPhone 7 Plus, but a smaller form factor because the Essential smartphone has an edge-to-edge display that lacks bezels. A magnetic connector does double-duty for charging and as a port for hardware accessories, including a spherical 360-degree camera. The screen could be pressure-sensitive, like the iPhone’s. And Essential is reportedly working on a ceramic back, which would utilize the same premium material used in AAPL’s latest flagship Apple Watch Edition Series 2. Behind it all, the Essential smartphone would feature advanced AI technology, which would take on Siri. Is This a Real Threat to the iPhone 8? On one hand, it’s easy to dismiss the Essential smartphone. It’s still in the prototype phase, and if its design is finalized, it may ultimately lack some of the features like the ceramic back. There are big unanswered questions, too, including what operating system it will run.

More posts by this contributor: Apple lays the groundwork to kill online advertising How to join the network Mankind has a complex relationship with the notion of Artificial Intelligence. Tinged with both fear and fascination; the timeline for AI development is punctuated by cultural and historical events that have brought with them new speculation and theories. Mechanical men and artificial beings were a prevalent feature of Greek myth, including the golden robots of Hephaestus and Pygmalion’s Galatea; Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein introduced generations of readers to a terrifying idea of non-human intelligence; and, in more recent times, the dialogue has included the idea of computerized tech becoming a threat to the existence of our species. These recent concerns culminated in the 2015 “Open Letter on Artificial Intelligence”, signed by over 150 people including Professor Stephen Hawking, and have been perpetuated by Elon Musk’s occasional ominous remarks. In 2014, the entrepreneur billionaire wrote on Twitter that “We need to be super careful with AI”, and that it is “Potentially more dangerous than nukes”; less than a year later, Musk donated $10 million to the Future of Life Institute towards research into how mankind can keep a handle on AI; and in June of this year, he expressed a concern over tech giants, Facebook and Google, leaning closer towards intelligent robotics. However, the concerns of Hawking, Musk and other influential technocrats and academics are not as far-flung in the future as you might think. In fact, AI is already deeply ingrained in our society in a far more subtle and sinister way. The latest outburst in our ongoing relationship with AI occurred in the aftermath of Trump’s election. News outlets reported on the “Facebook bubble” – an echo chamber of personalized news feeds that shielded users from opposing views and exposed them to a stream of content that reinforced their existing beliefs.  The criticism was that Facebook failed to allow for a meaningful discourse between different political factions. And while the claim was denied by Mark Zuckerberg, there were similar complaints in the United Kingdom after the surprising Brexit referendum result. At its most benign, this bubble corrupted the pollsters’ predictions; at its worst, it impacted the results of two of the most important political decisions of the century in the Western world. Perhaps it’s time to take a closer look at the supposed bias of the technology we interface with on a daily basis, and ask some serious questions about what its implications are, and will potentially be, in the future. 3D render of a robot trying to solve a wooden cube puzzle Machine Learning and the “Sea of Dudes” The current problems faced by AI come down to the age-old, complex relationship between creator and creation. If we are creating a system of machine learning that plays a fundamental role in all aspects of society, then the danger is that we run the risk that the systems’ creators will pass on their own inherent and natural biases onto these machines. A tech-based society has often been heralded as the future’s solution to prejudice and inequality. H.G. Wells imagined machine-run utopias where the human inhabitants were free to explore their passions and politically liberal pursuits; likewise, Edward Bellamy’s novel, Looking Backward, envisioned a libertarian socialist system built on the foundations of technological advances. Even in more recent times, digital technologies have kept up a sheen of utopian promise and were seen as a real and tangible key to unlocking universal social justice. Professor B.C. Mahapatra claimed that “Computerized education will reduce prejudice as no other system can” due to the suggestion that computers lack “prejudice, bias, or bigotry.” However, the idea that technology might end prejudice is coming under increasing scrutiny and appearing more and more spurious. Instead, questions have been raised in the public sphere about the extent of tech’s bias, particularly in the algorithms that run through social media and search engine sites. Even before media and the public began questioning Facebook’s supposed “news bubble” in the aftermath of Brexit and the election, the US Senate demanded an official explanation from Zuckerberg about the platform’s perceived liberal bias concerning trending topics.  And again Facecbook denied the accusation that it was manipulating content and somehow tailoring the news that its users were sharing . Google has also come under fire for a seemingly biased gremlin in the machine. Recently, graphic designer Johana Burai’s research into pictures of “hands” showed that almost all the searches yielded by Google were white, and that searches for “black hands” or “African hands” tended to show images in questionable contexts i.e. a white hand reaching out to offer help to a black one, or hands working in the earth. In June, a tweet went viral where a gentleman compared the image search results from “three black teenagers” vs “three white teenagers.” YOOOOOO LOOK AT THIS pic.twitter.com/uY1JysFm8w — 💫deadbeat daddy💫 (@iBeKabir) June 7, 2016 Both highlight the fact that our algorithms amplify our worst tendencies. The systems are trained and learn from human behaviors at their rawest and most unfiltered. Although Google isn’t racist, the people it’s learning from surely have some biases. Of course, the fact that technology is biased shouldn’t come as too much of a shock to any of us. More often than not, technological advances have favored their creator, unconsciously at least. Any left-handed person will testify to the problems they’ve encountered using scissors, ledgers and can-openers. As Professor H. Vanderleest wrote in his essay “The Built-in Bias of Technology”, “Technology is obviously biased towards at least one use – the use intended by the designer.” The problem is that we’re not just talking about the bias of scissors, ledgers and can-openers, and a quick glance at the demographics of those working in the tech industry points to a hugely disproportionate lack of women, and Black and Latino people. The concern is that this homogeneity of white men – the “sea of dudes”, as Margaret Mitchell, researcher at Microsoft, calls it – will unconsciously program their machines with a narrow world-view. Beyond the design bias introduced by a homogenous group of people, early products and systems are biased by their first adopters. In many cases, those first adopters are socially connected to the team that creates the products. Networks, especially, are very biased by the first cohorts that use the platform. They decide on the culture and drive the decisions of the product creators. The early adopters, often, become the most successful users because they are scaffolded and promoted by the product to advertise success stories to the world. This is especially true for social networks where the cost and difficulty in gaining a following gets more difficult over time as the network saturates. The implications of these biases are potentially dire to certain groups of people. What if your ability to access the latest networks was essential to your position in society? That’s not so far from reality today. The more and more our online statuses and the algorithms that are incumbent on them reflect themselves in our offline lives, the more power we place in a system that is largely out of our control and beyond our understanding. Reimagining the Glass Ceiling Effect The bias of tech and its implications has the potential to go far deeper than the homogeneous “sea of dudes”. As society becomes more dependent on technology, we risk exacerbating existing biases, and even creating new areas of prejudice by not actively working towards diversification or considering the morality of our product decisions. The root of this problem lies in a user’s ability to interface with the newest technologies in the first place. This is a problem that certain minorities have been living with since computerized tech took such a prominent place in our everyday lives. The blind community, for instance, has often been unable to interface with the latest tech advances. Until Apple added VoiceOver to the iPhone 3GS in 2009, smartphones were just expensive paperweights for the blind; those with sight problems are often stopped in their tracks by websites with early versions of CAPTCHA. The ever-increasing use of images on sites such as Buzzfeed and general social media means that there are still areas of the Internet that are simply off-limits. Baby boomers and the elderly have fallen victim to the quickening and often myopic march of tech. Because they often lack the education or cultural know-how of younger generations, many of them are left on the periphery of certain industries, and there are plenty of reported cases of elderly workers not considered for positions or even forced from their jobs. As recently as 2007, Zuckerberg made the contentious statement that “Young people are just smarter”, and voiced his preference for hiring people below the age of 30. It seems that Silicon Valley hasn’t moved on much and ageism is still running rampant. These examples are foreboding warnings as to how easy it already is to fall behind in society as a result of one’s relationship with tech. The natural extension of this: we have created a system where those who are able to keep up with the latest technological advances are at an immediate advantage. A study into the five stages of technology adoption shows that the first, early adopters, don’t just influence the bias of networks, they also have a significant impact on the development of all tech advances. According to the study, the “innovators” and “early adopters” of tech make up just 16% of the consumer market, and “are typically younger in age, have a higher social status, have more financial liquidity, advanced education, and are more socially forward than late adopters.” This would have serious ramifications for the other 84% of tech customers who are neither “innovators” or “early adopters”. Money and time would be invaluable resources that would have a direct correlation to someone’s social position, ability to generate wealth and how easily they could climb the career ladder. Suddenly, the inherent bias of tech has taken a turn towards socio-economics and keeping us in an unjust social prison that many hoped it would help us to break out of. The increasing influence of tech has become crucial for the millennial generations. Audience has become a form of wealth and, for many, it’s core to how we live. It is reputation, and affects how we’re treated every day. More and more, our online statuses are having a direct bearing on our offline lives. In modern day contemporary networking, a good LinkedIn profile is essential; long gone are the days of inebriated profile pictures as they may bring us into disrepute with a boss, potential boss or future employer. We’re no longer simply judged on face-to-face meetings but instead on what a Google search spews out. So, who will this affect? It’s clear that those who go to less expensive schools and don’t have the means to keep up with the latest software and gadgets will be at a disadvantage. In tech-marketing terms, these groups are known as “Late majority” or “Laggards”. They share traits of being older in age, and lower in social status and, often, wealth. The issue is that these biases exist beyond our control. That’s not to say that the systems adopt a conscious bias. As I’ve already mentioned, much of the problem lies in the disproportionate demographics working in the tech industry, but it is also a result of how tech relates to marketing and metrics. Using machine learning and algorithms to sell to target audiences is about simplifying the problem without taking into consideration the wider problem of who might be left behind. Explicit marketing bias by its very nature includes and excludes certain groups. While none of these systems are necessarily malevolent or ill-intentioned,  the reality is that they are silencing huge swathes of society and, in the process, selling keys to the doors of the future that many people simply can’t afford. Fixing the Problem: A Question of What We Accept The major problems faced in our relationship with AI are three-fold: the tech is not created by a proportionate representation of society; the first adopters that are helped to succeed on the platforms are skewed due to their relationship with the creators; and the moral implications of tech advances aren’t taken into consideration. Of course, there’s no simple solution to any of these problems. Diversity of the creators will drive a diversity of the first users but that’s not enough. Tech giants are increasingly working towards assembling better, more diverse data sets to combat the second issue. Or, at least, they’re acknowledging that there’s a problem. Facebook and Google have consistently spoken about working towards a more diverse team of employees; and, after the Tay chatbot displayed racist, homophobic and sexist personality traits, Microsoft have insisted they’re making a determined effort “to do a better job of classifying gender and other diversity signals in training data sets.” However, how can society go about addressing the lack of foresight: ensuring that tech companies consider the moral implications of the products and AI they’re creating? Machine learning systems aren’t programmed to take morality into consideration. They’re functional. They are more concerned with marketing and metrics than creating a fairer world. AI is created in mankind’s image, always working towards an answer, and in order to get there often operates as efficiently as possible. To break down a problem you must simplify it; it doesn’t help by adding in variables to do with fairly representing all demographics and making sure that no one is left behind. Let’s not forget that humans simplify problems, as well, to get through the tens of thousands of decisions we make every day. The negative side is we end up stereotyping, generalizing, and create false connections between cause and effect. One solution could be to offset machine bias in the same way that we have done with humans. Input a mix of different known biases into the system. By creating AIs with different sets of bias, it’s possible that their prejudices would level the playing ground by building a middle ground consensus. Of course, the notion of applying theoretical restraints on the future of AI and machine learning is laced with difficulties. Not only would it be nigh-on-impossible to enforce such a regime on the myriad of tech companies that employ these algorithmic systems, but it would be an uneasy, dictatorial restriction on the freedom we have over technological advances. Perhaps the only viable solution lies in the hands of AI’s creators. It’s up to them to apply the moral standards onto what they create and to do their best to ensure that the latest products aren’t only available to the more affluent sections of society. And perhaps it’s also up to us to make sure that they do so. By being vigilant with tech giants we can ensure they use AI to close the gaps of diversity instead of widening them. Otherwise, we will carry the status quo of bias into the tech era, amplifying old prejudices and creating new ones along the way.

LG's new flagship models -- to be unveiled next month -- will carry the U.S. tech giant's artificial intelligence (AI) Google Assistant, the sources with knowledge of the matter said. Both LG and Google have not acknowledged whether the sources are correct. The sources said LG agreed with Google last year to feature the assistant, and is at the final stage of stabilizing the software before unveiling the model just ahead of the Mobile World Congress show in February. LG has been making efforts to expand its market share in the global smartphone world dominated by its local rival Samsung Electronics Co. and the U.S. giant Apple Inc. The two tech firms have been strengthening their AI-assisted voice butler services on their flagship models. This photo captured from the website of Google Assistant shows the AI-assisted voice butler service. (Yonhap) iPhone already has its AI voice recognition program, Siri, and Samsung is working on its own smart assistant for the next Galaxy S8, called Bixby. "Google Assistant will be very helpful for LG Electronics when all other tech firms are showcasing their voice assistant service," said a source not to be named. "The difficult task for LG is whether the service will recognize the Korean language."    The AI-assisted service will allow users to interact with the device by giving voice commands about music, weather information and other information. However, the companies have not substantiated the claims. "This is speculation that the company cannot confirm at the moment," an LG official said. Google also declined to comment on the matter at the moment. LG earlier said the G6 would be equipped with "heat pipes" for better cooling as part of its efforts to strengthen product safety. It lowers the temperature of the application processor inside a smartphone by some 6-10 percent by dispersing heat and helping prevent excessive heat from reaching the battery cell. LG said Thursday it will unveil the G6 in Barcelona, Spain, on Feb. 26, a day before the opening of the mobile show. LG's G6 (Photo courtesy of LG Electronic Inc.)

If you are willing to assume the risk, however, there's still a way to install third-party extensions you find in the wild. CNET Internet by Matt Elliott January 18, 2017 12:29 PM PST @themattelliott Up Next Meet Jon Hamm, the hologram (aka the holohamm) Google has, over the years, increased its restrictions for installing third-party Chrome extensions to help protect Chrome users from malicious code. A few years ago, you could simply install an extension from a developer's site without any hassle. Last year, you needed only to enable Developer mode before installing a CRX (Chrome extension) file. Now, according to Google, "to protect you while you browse, Chrome only lets you use extensions that have been published on the Chrome Web Store." If you are willing to assume the risk, there is a side door that Google left ajar for developers to test out their extensions, which you can use to install extensions that aren't listed in the Chrome Web Store. And here's the part where I say again that installing unverified extensions from unknown sources is risky and could expose your computer to malicious code. Proceed at your own risk. Still with me? OK, here are the steps needed to install an extension from somewhere other than the Chrome Web Store. 1. Download the CRX file to your computer for the Chrome extension you want to install. 2. Go to chrome://extensions/ and check the box for Developer mode in the top right. Matt Elliott/CNET 3. Use a CRX Extractor app -- I used CRX Extractor -- to unpack the CRX file and turn it into a ZIP file. 4. Locate the ZIP file on your computer and unzip it. 5. Go back to the chrome://extensions/ page and click the Load unpacked extension button and select the unzipped folder for your extension to install it.

The city announced earlier this month that it had paused Google’s ability to install its so-called “fiber huts” after complaints from some very vocal residents near Haskin Park on the Northeast Side. But Google likely had decided itself to slow installation of its 15 remaining planned huts because of changes in technology, Deputy City Manager Peter Zanoni told the council. Google officials declined a city invitation to the Wednesday meeting. The company’s local lobbyist, Frank Burney, also did not attend. “What they’re doing today is looking at the whole network and changes in technology,” Zanoni said about Google Fiber’s plan. “They would be doing this step-aside and reevaluating this network anyway.” City Manager Sheryl Sculley announced earlier this month that the municipality had paused the installation of prefabricated Fiber Huts, which house technology as part of the backbone of the fiber-optic network. The company’s plan called for 17 huts — about 12 feet wide, 30 feet long and 9 feet tall — to be installed on city properties across the city. Two huts have been installed — in the city’s Haskin and West End parks — and the other 15 are on hold. The city’s decision to pause Google’s ability to continue hut installation was driven, at leat in part, by complaints from residents near Haskin Park. Meanwhile, city officials have killed eight planned locations — four parks, three vacant residential lots and one library, which had a deed restriction preventing the hut from being installed. Zanoni and others say they determined that parks and vacant residential lots owned by the city weren’t appropriate locations for the huts. There are no plans, however, to remove the two that have already been installed.

But as a final act of spite the group released 61 files from a cache of hundreds of programs allegedly belonging to an exploitation framework used by the U.S. National Security Agency. The files reportedly include programs for compromising systems and circumventing defensive software, including antivirus programs. The group released the files because many—44, according to security experts—could be detected by at least one antivirus program, the group said in a statement posted online. Google is updating some features on its Google Play Store so enterprises can more easily use the app to distribute in-house and custom developed Android applications to their employees. Google Play offers a so-called Private Channel feature that lets Google apps administrators host internal Android applications and control access to specific users or groups of users. Organizations that set up a Private Channel on Google Play get additional benefits such as user authentication along with malware and virus detection. The updates announced this week will become available Jan. 31 and are designed to make enterprise applications distributed through Play Store more easily discoverable and accessible to end users. Microsoft officially launched a new Office 365 app this week called StaffHub that helps businesses with so-called deskless workers manage schedules on the fly and without having to scramble to update an Excel worksheet or whiteboard when an employee requests a shift change. Not everyone who punches a clock at the start of the workday settles into an office or cubicle. Microsoft estimates that there are more than 500 million workers toiling away at hotels, retailers, restaurants and other service-oriented businesses around the globe. By and large, they rarely log into a PC at work to access, update and share company information, meaning they often rely on paper-based processes to fill out and revise work schedules. StaffHub is designed for these workers. It is available to customers with Office 365 K1, E1, E3 or E5 plans. It allows managers to publish and manage shift schedules on the web. Microsoft today announced it had acquired Maluuba, a Canadian artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing technology firm. Financial terms were not disclosed. Citing the company's progress in speech and image recognition, Microsoft is now setting its sights on "literate machines," according to Harry Shum, executive vice president of Microsoft's Artificial Intelligence and Research Group. "Maluuba's expertise in deep learning and reinforcement learning for question-answering and decision-making systems will help us advance our strategy to democratize AI and to make it accessible and valuable to everyone—consumers, businesses and developers," said Shum in a Jan. 13 announcement. Microsoft envisions creating AI-enabled systems that can absorb information and communicate their findings in ways people share information with one another.       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows Google Open Sources Data Visualization Tool for Machine Learning Cisco Security Business Group Continues to Accelerate Growth Amazon Go Won't Kill Many Jobs, But It May Prove a Boon to Crooks Microsoft, Harman Kardon to Take on Amazon Echo, Google Home Yahoo Suffers New Hack; 1 Billion Users Impacted This Time 10 Things T-Mobile Has Done to Move O...

Google has agreed to acquire Fabric, Twitter’s application development platform for an undisclosed amount of cash. Once the deal is approved, Fabric's team will join Google’s Developer Products Group and work with the company's Firebase application development platform team. "Fabric and Firebase operate mobile platforms with unique strengths in the market today," Fabric’s vice president of engineering Rich Paret said in a blog announcing the planned acquisition. "We're excited to combine these platforms together to make the best mobile developer platform in the world for app teams." Twitter announced Fabric in October 2014 as a modular platform for building mobile applications. The platform consists of multiple kits that are designed to help developers address mobile app stability issues as well as those pertaining to application distribution and revenue generation. One of Fabric's most popular and downloaded products is Crashlytics, a kit, which according to Fabric, can help developers detect, access and fix bugs in their code much faster than other available tools. Developers can use Crashlytics to isolate the root cause of a problem down to the exact line of code, according to Fabric. As part of the Crashlytics kit, Fabric includes a real-time app analytics component called Answers by Crashlytics and a separate user feedback component that allows developers to assess the overall health of an application. By acquiring Fabric, Google will also gain access to a so-called Twitter Kit that developers can use to leverage Twitter for distributing mobile applications. The kit includes a native Tweet embedding capability that gives developers a way to place Tweets in their applications with a few lines of code. Also part of the Twitter kit is a sign-in feature that developers can use to enable users of their applications to login via Twitter. Another kit that likely stoked Google's interest in Fabric is MoPub, which Twitter has described as a monetization platform for mobile application developers. The kit gives developers a way to more easily integrate ad-serving features in their mobile applications and to ensure that applications work smoothly with ads and advertisers across multiple mobile ad networks. Fabric's Twitter Kit also includes Digits, a SMS authentication tool that makes it easier for developers to enable application sign-in via mobile phone numbers instead of usernames and passwords. More than 580,000 application developers have downloaded Fabric and applications developed on the platform are currently installed on some 2.5 billion mobile devices worldwide, according to Twitter. In a blog, Google Firebase product manager Francis Ma noted that after the acquisition is complete, Crashlytics would become Firebase's main crash reporting product. Google will release more details about how Fabric's products will be integrated with those from Firebase in coming weeks and months, he added. "The integration of Fabric is part of our larger, long-term effort of delivering a comprehensive suite of features for iOS, Android and mobile Web app development," Ma said. Google acquired Firebase in 2014 and since then has focused on making it a unified app development platform for Android and IOS applications as well as for mobile Web development purposes. Last May Google added several new tools to Firebase including an analytics component, a cloud message feature and a remote configuration capability. As part of the Firebase expansion last year, Google introduced the crash reporting capability that will soon be replaced by Crashlytics and a test lab feature for finding vulnerabilities in Android apps. For Twitter, the Fabric sale continues the company's efforts to improve its bottom line by divesting itself of non-essential businesses. Last October, the company announced that it would be killing off its Vine video-sharing network and reincarnating it as a mobile app for Android and iOS.           LATEST MOBILE ARTICLES   Science Foundation, Carmakers Collaborate on Autonomous Vehicles Samsung Reveals Cause of Galaxy Note7 Battery Fires, Explosions Google Voice Telephony Service Gets First Update in 5 Years More Than 250,000 Android Apps Updated Through Google's ASI Program New Apple iPad Pro, Microsoft Surface Pro Likely to Appear in March                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows Google Open Sources Data Visualization Tool for Machine Learning Cisco Security Business Group Continues to Accelerate Growth Amazon Go Won't Kill Many Jobs, But It May Prove a Boon to Crooks Microsoft, Harman Kardon to Take on Amazon Echo, Google Home Yahoo Suffers New Hack; 1 Billion Users Impacted This Time 10 Things T-Mobile Has Done to Move O...

By Paul Flahive • Jan 18, 2017 TweetShareGoogle+Email Credit City of San Antonio TCI San Antonio City Council members got a few more details Wednesday about delays in building a Google Fiber network.  The city paused construction after residents complained about the size of the 12-by-30 feet Google “huts,” that house the infrastructure for the project.  City staff members told the council they will need to find new locations on city property for 8 of the remaining 15 Google huts to be built.  Credit City of San Antonio TCI District 3 Councilman Alan Warrick says his constituents are open to keeping the hut slated for 325 Gray Street as is. It is currently a vacant lot. Deputy City Manager Peter Zanoni says it will still be two to three weeks before the length of the construction delay is clear.   "The component pieces may look different. They may use more wireless. The hut sites, the hut size, the number of of locations, all that is under review and it could change when they come back to us in a couple of weeks," says Zanoni. City staff members say Google estimates the project will be done in within 4-5 years of the start date, which was April of 2016. Transportation and Capital Improvement staff say the first of three rings is substantially complete.

 Mark Zuckerberg explains Facebook's secrets for acquiring companies Alex Heath Jan. 18, 2017, 7:13 PM 53,220 facebook linkedin twitter email print Scott Olson / Getty Images In the weeks leading up to Mark Zuckerberg's decision to buy Oculus for $2 billion, he received a concerning message from Brendan Iribe, who was then the Oculus CEO. Google was also interested in buying the virtual reality startup. A similar situation occurred during Facebook's two-week negotiation process to acquire WhatsApp for $19 billion in 2014. A rival tech giant, believed to have also been Google, offered WhatsApp more money in an attempt to steal the messaging app away from Zuckerberg. Facebook ended up successfully closing deals on Oculus and WhatsApp within a few weeks, beating out Google twice. Zuckerberg gave a rare insight into how he approaches acquiring other companies during a public testimony in a Dallas courtroom on Tuesday. He was there to testify in a lawsuit against Oculus by the video game publisher ZeniMax. Here are Zuckerberg's four main acquisition strategies, which Business Insider obtained through a court transcript of his testimony. 1. Build relationships first Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom with Mark Zuckerberg. Facebook While Facebook conducted its legal due diligence on Oculus over one weekend, Zuckerberg explained that he usually approaches big acquisitions by first establishing friendships with the founders of the companies he's looking to scoop up. "In reality what is happening with all of these, in Instagram and WhatsApp and Oculus, they are kind of things that we've been thinking about for a long time," he said. "And I've been building relationships, at least in Instagram and the WhatsApp cases, for years with the founders and the people that are involved in these companies," he said, "which made it so that when it became time or when we thought it was the right time to move, we felt like we had a good amount of context and had good relationships so that we could move quickly, which was competitively important and why a lot of these acquisitions, I think, came to us instead of our competitors and ended up being very good acquisitions over time that a lot of competitors wished they had gotten instead." 2. Have a shared vision Mark Zuckerberg, left, tries the Oculus-powered Gear VR headset with Brendan Iribe. Facebook Zuckerberg said that the main reason he was able to acquire Oculus for less than the $4 billion its team originally wanted was because he pitched a vision of collaboration between the two companies that everyone bought into. "The most important thing was aligning and getting excited about a shared vision and about how we're going to work together," he said. "Or if they built the hardware and we built the experiences, how that could be better than either of us working separately. "If this [the deal] is going to happen, it's not going to be because we offer a lot of money, although we're going to have to offer a fair price for the company that is more than what they felt like they could do on their own. But they also need to feel like this was actually going to help their mission, right?" The shared vision has to go both ways, Zuckerberg explained. "There's a lot of anxiety in these deals, right?" he said. "I mean, if you're going to pay $19 billion for a company or $2 billion for a company, you clearly have to really believe in it." 3. Sometimes use scare tactics Snap CEO Evan Spiegel, whose company is preparing for an initial public offering that could value its business at $25 billion. Getty/Michael Kovac While he prefers to sell a founder on a shared vision, Zuckerberg admitted to sometimes scaring small startups by making them imagine how difficult it would be to run their businesses alone. "That's less my thing, but I think if you are trying to help convince people that they want to join you, helping them understand all the pain that they would have to go through to build it out independently is a valuable tactic," he said. It's unclear whether he used that tactic on Evan Spiegel, who famously turned down on Zuckerberg's $3 billion offer to buy Snapchat a few years ago. 4. Move fast and buy things WhatsApp cofounder Jan Koum. David Ramos / Getty Images When Zuckerberg's top dealmaker, Amin Zoufonoun, warned him that doing legal due diligence on Oculus over one weekend carried "some risk," Zuckerberg told him to keep "pushing forward until we have something we can sign on a moment's notice." "When you're making deals and it is a competitive situation, you often don't have a lot of time," he said. That line of thinking is consistent with Facebook's old company motto, "move fast and break things." It's also a key strategy to keep competitors from beating Facebook to sign on the dotted line. "Some of the bigger acquisitions that we have done, like Instagram and WhatsApp, which were each more than a billion dollars, we had to move quickly because other companies — whether it was Google or, you know, Twitter or Apple, or whatever the companies were — were also trying to talk to these companies and buy them," Zuckerberg said. "And often, if a company knows we're offering something, they will offer more," he continued. "So being able to move quickly not only increases our chance of being able to get a deal done if we want to, but it makes it so we don't have end up having to pay a lot more because the process drags out. "I think some companies might just take many weeks or months to review some stuff, and I think one of the things we've always prided ourselves on and one of the things that has always worked well for Facebook is that we've just been able to be flexible and move quickly on important things. And that's served us very well."

But his offer came with a hefty price — $200,000. The ongoing litigation involving suburban Chicago man Triano Williams and the Indianapolis-based American College of Education highlights a situation that cybersecurity experts warn could occur more frequently. As companies and individuals outsource the development and operations of their websites and tech programs to others, they're also giving up control and putting themselves at risk, said Gene Spafford, founder and executive director emeritus of Purdue University's Center for Education and Research in Information Assurance and Security. It's similar to any business or school entrusting just one employee with the responsibility of maintaining an account or knowing how something internal works, Spafford added. "Think of it this way: Would you have only one person writing checks or one person holding the key to the factory?" he asked.

After he was fired from the school last February and returned his computer equipment, officials in June learned they could not access the Google account, which had about 2,000 student emails and course work accounts. At that point, Williams, who sought legal aid, refused to help unless the school wanted to rehire him as a consultant and pay him accordingly. "In order to amicably settle this dispute, Mr. Williams requires a clean letter of reference, and payment of $200,000," his attorney, Calvita Frederick, wrote to ACE's attorney. The school filed a lawsuit against Williams for intentional interference with a contractual relationship, among other accusations, and sought court action to compel him to provide the user name and password for the Google account. Related: Simple Cyber Security Tips to Protect Your Online Accounts Against Hackers Frederick told NBC News on Wednesday that her client never even knew the password because it was autosaved in the school's laptop computer. While Williams did have the ability to help figure out how to access the Google account, she advised him that he was under no obligation to be "fixing it for free." Frederick blamed the school for creating its own "monstrous situation" when other employees with IT expertise were let go before Williams. She also filed a discrimination lawsuit against the school, claiming that Williams, who is black and had been with ACE since 2007, was being retaliated against for complaining to supervisors that the "racial climate was uncomfortable." Before he was terminated, Williams was told that he would have to move from the Chicago area to Indiana to maintain employment. But Frederick said he refused because he was under a joint custody agreement with his daughter's mother and was unable to relocate. Frederick said the requested $200,000 compensation was meant to settle the discrimination case and was not a form of a financial shakedown. "Mr. Williams didn't do anything intentional to them," Frederick added. The school has since been able to have Google unlock the account for them, although that took time because the tech giant generally only provides account information to the designated administrator. In ACE's case, that had been Williams. Yesterday, press reports were published regarding a case that involves ACE information technology.

This comes almost two years since the speakers first became available, and after lots of feedback was provided by various users of said forum (and more people on the Google Product Forum, too)… Multi-room casting has been around since the launch of the Chromecast Audio all the way back in 2015, and recently third-party manufacturers have had the opportunity of adding to their own lines of speakers. At this point, B&O, Sony, Vizio have all added the functionality to some of their speakers, so it would make sense that LG would follow in line — and the company said it decided to throw in support for Google Home for good measure. We have prepared Google Multiroom functionality. During preparing for that, we also discuss with Google team about Link with Google Home device function. And, we decide to update two major functionalities, “Google Multiroom” and “Link with Google Home device” at same time. If you own any of these Music Flow speakers, you’ll be glad to know that these new features should be rolling out before the end of February. We’ll keep an eye on the Music Flow community and let you know when the new functionality is hitting Music Flow systems.

Rather, they have to be sideloaded as APKs, and that’s where holes open up. In trying to close some of those holes, Google added a feature to its package of Android services a while back. When sideloading an APK, “Verify Apps” runs a check to see if it’s malicious. However, this measure isn’t perfect. In some cases, an unsafe app would make its way around the feature and disable it. When that occurs, there are two possible scenarios as Google details in a blog post. Either that phone has stopped working for a normal reason, like the user upgrading their device and powering down the old one, or because a malicious app has deactivated the service. A device that has stopped checking in with Verify Apps is considering DOI (dead or insecure). By checking to see how many users have downloaded a specific app and then had their device go DOI, Google can — along with other methods — determine if that app is the causing the issue. If so, the company can mark that app as a “PHA” or potentially harmful application. That, in turn, can help protect other Android users downloading the same application. On the other hand, Google determines if an app is safe by measuring “retention.” In this case, that means the Verify Apps feature continued working after the app was installed. By using the formula below to find the app’s “Z-score”, Google can determine whether the app is safe or a PHA. If the app has an extremely poor Z-score, Google can immediately classify it as a PHA and use Verify App to kill existing installs and prevent future installations. Apps with more reasonable scores undergo further investigation. Among others, the DOI score flagged many apps in three well known malware families— Hummingbad, Ghost Push, and Gooligan. Although they behave differently, the DOI scorer flagged over 25,000 apps in these three families of malware because they can degrade the Android experience to such an extent that a non-negligible amount of users factory reset or abandon their devices. This approach provides us with another perspective to discover PHAs and block them before they gain popularity. Without the DOI scorer, many of these apps would have escaped the extra scrutiny of a manual review. Guides Android Breaking news for Android. Get the latest on apps, carriers, devices, and more!

The bug hinders user’s ability to connect their devices to a car’s speakers. What’s even more annoying is that Google has yet to acknowledge and fix this problem. Google’s Product Forum is filled with threads from different Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P users that are complaining about this issue, but the Android parent has yet to provide users with a fix. In fact, the first time this issues came to light was back in late October and users of the affected devices were expecting Google to include a fix for this problem in the January security patch. Well as everybody knows, this wasn’t the case. What’s more interesting is the fact that there isn’t any known solution, not even on the Android XDA forums. Right now all that Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P users can do is to hope that Android 7.1.2 Nougat is coming out soon and that’s where the fix will be included. Or maybe if the problem is widespread enough Google will be forced to acknowledge it and develop an OTA (over-the-air) software fix. Nonetheless, for the time being we advise users of the affected devices to acquire a 3.5mm auxiliary cord that can be used to connect their smartphones to the car’s speakers. Worth mentioning is that older cars don’t feature a 3.5mm audio jack and users should check for the port before buying an auxiliary cord.

Luckily this security breach was quickly fixed by the Android parent, so fast that the Android community didn’t even know about it until X-Force’s report was released. The reason why this security flaw was considered to be a major threat is because it allowed hackers to get access to Nexus 6 and 6P’s messages, contacts, GPS location and even gave them the ability to place or intercept phone calls. This exploit could have been used through Google’s Android Debug Bridge and this means that hackers needed physical access to the targeted device to connect to a PC via USB. Gladly there aren’t any reports to point out that someone has been affected by this exploit, the main reason behind this is that the exploit wasn’t in the media and it was kept under wraps for just enough time so that Google could release a fix. According to the security team, hackers could hijack the targeted Nexus 6 or 6P phone by using Android Debug Bridge’s user interface. This feature is being used by developers to side-load different applications on their Android powered device. The feature’s user interface allowed hackers to listen to incoming phone calls while users had no idea this was happening. Nonetheless, Google proved once again how high of a price it puts on Android security and quickly launched January’s security patch which included a fix that was especially designed for this security flaw. Nexus 6 was the first one to have this problem fixed through an OTA (over-the-air) update and Nexus 6P received it in January. Google’s promptness in regards to system security upates is truly outstanding. While there aren’t any reports to show that someone has been affected by this issue, this is still a major concern for Android users. We can expect that Google’s going to put their upcoming software updates through a bunch of additional security test next time in order to avoid this type of issues. Especially since a major security threat like this one managed to somehow slip through the cracks.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google’s Android One reportedly headed to the US By Rei Padla - January 18, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Android One is Google’s effort to bring super low cost and regularly updated Android phones to consumers. The brand is available in several developing markets like India, Africa, Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines, and Myanmar. It may have originally started in emerging markets but Android One is also now available in the UK, Turkey, Spain, Portugal, and even Japan. You may ask why such affordable phones are needed in Japan but looks like Google is definitely expanding as it has reached the United States. Google is said to be releasing Android One phones later this 2017 in the US as a way to strengthen the brand. Not that there are no budget-friendly smartphones in the American market but the Android One is different. It’s different in the sense that it is always up-to-date-. That means the updates are always on time. No need to wait long for software updates and wonder if and when they are arriving. There’s no information yet what Android One phone will be first released in the US but sources are saying it could be LG. We’re interested to know when Android One will include the Daydream VR platform. It may be tough for some OEMs because of the minimum specs required for the platform. We’ll see.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Google’s high-end Pixels scarce for buyers, but firm plans lower-end phones for U.S.: reports By Ethan Baron / January 18, 2017 at 5:40 PM Google’s new high-end Pixel smartphones are mostly out of stock, and meanwhile the firm plans to bring lower-cost Android phones to the U.S. market, two new reports said. In October, Google splashily announced the new Pixel and Pixel XL, and they received generally positive reviews.  But would-be buyers have been stymied, a report said Wednesday. “It has become incredibly difficult for consumers to actually acquire either of them in a reasonable amount of time,” said an article on tech website The Verge. “Google has done a poor job of shipping adequate supply of both Pixels, as it’s now January and there’s still no easy way of obtaining the model you want without resorting to eBay or Swappa.” Google fell down on the shipping job with the Pixel XL in particular, according to the website. The XL with 128GB capacity hasn’t been in stock in Google’s online store since the end of November, The Verge reported. The website noted that Google and Verizon Wireless made “a fairly big deal” about the Pixels being “exclusive” to Verizon, but that hasn’t made purchasing one easier for Verizon’s customers, the site said. “Orders placed today for the 128GB Pixel XL aren’t scheduled to ship until the second week of March. March!” The Verge sniffed. “It’s fairly difficult (though not impossible) to find the regular, 5-inch Pixel with 128GB of storage in stock at Verizon retail locations. “But online orders for the smaller size are beginning to slide back weeks, too. The black 128GB Pixel is backordered into February. If you want the white color, you might wait until March.” March! Meanwhile, Google intends to expand to the U.S. its “Android One” program for phones using the Android operating system, “promising phone makers major new promotional dollars if they play by its rules,” according to a report Tuesday on subscription tech site The Information. The first phone to enter the U.S. market under the Android One program should arrive before midyear, at a price of $200 to $300, according to (paywall) The Information, which based its report on unnamed sources said to have been briefed on the plan. “It will be made by a phone manufacturer whose identity couldn’t be learned,” the site said. “It will be different from other Android phones because it will guarantee timely software updates, including security updates, for two years from sale date, one of the people said. That’s something Android often fails to do, unlike Apple.” Google launched Android One in 2014 in India, and expanded it to Europe and Japan last year, The Information said. “Part of the Android One push is aimed at strengthening Google’s brand name,” the site reported. “Google has spent years running ads for Android in the U.S., including with TV spots, but phone makers believe Android’s brand name still isn’t widely understood. Consumers know the brands of individual phone makers such as Samsung.”   Photo: Rick Osterloh, Google senior vice president of hardware, introduces the new Google Pixel phone during a product event, Tuesday, Oct. 4, 2016, in San Francisco.

Maybe you've forgotten all about candida after high school biology, or maybe you've never even heard of it. But one quick Google search could give you the idea that it's responsible for your fatigue, headaches, bloating, and even memory problems. So how much of this "candida syndrome" is total internet pseudoscience? Kind of a lot, actually. Many of these ideas can be traced back to the early '90s, after the publication of a book called The Yeast Connection, which claimed that all of those non-specific symptoms (and more!) could be signs of an overgrowth of candida throughout your entire body. Since then, however, those claims still have yet to be proven and have, therefore, been rejected by mainstream science and medicine. But that doesn't mean candida isn't an important factor when it comes to your health. Here's what you really need to know about it — and how it actually affects you. What is candida? It's yeast! That means it's a fungus, not a bacteria or a virus. In fact, there are a few different types of candida that live on and inside of you normally. But when we're talking about yeast causing problems, we're usually talking about Candida albicans. What problems can it cause? Under normal conditions, candida is an important part of your fragile inner ecosystem. But if your immune system is otherwise compromised, that balance may be thrown off. In those circumstances, an overgrowth of candida can lead to candidiasis, a.k.a. a yeast infection or "thrush." Yeast infections are most common in the vagina (causing itching, redness, burning, and a cottage cheese-like discharge) and mouth (leaving you with a thick, white coating on your tongue and cheeks as well as pain and redness). But you can also have localized yeast infections on your nails or patches of your skin, and they commonly develop on your nipples during breastfeeding. People who have diabetes, are pregnant, or douche are also more likely to develop yeast infections because all of those things can throw your yeast population out of whack. And it's not totally uncommon for people to develop yeast infections after taking a round of antibiotics because, in addition to the strain that being sick places on your immune system, those drugs upset the delicate bacteria-fungi balance. Plus, if your immune system is already compromised (e.g. you're getting chemo or you have HIV), your body has a harder time keeping that balance set. How do I get rid of it? Well, first off, remember that you don't want to totally get rid of your candida — it's important! But, if you're dealing with an actual infection, the easiest way to handle it is to talk to your doctor and get a prescription for anti-fungal medications. There are also over-the-counter medications, which are generally safe. But it's still a good idea to at least check in with your doctor before using one. And definitely make an appointment if those products aren't helping. Other conditions (such as bacterial vaginosis) often mimic the symptoms of yeast infections, and your doctor can help you figure out what's really going on. Some alternative health sections of the web may recommend a restrictive diet to counter your "candida syndrome." But as the Mayo Clinic notes, there's really no evidence that any of us should be following a specific "candida diet." If your yeast infections keep coming back, that may be a sign of a larger issue, such as diabetes, and it's definitely worth talking to your doc about. She may suggest a yeast culture to figure out which strain is infecting you (some don't respond so well to usual treatments), and she may suggest probiotics or simply switching to more breathable undies.

Jon Fingas, @jonfingas 01.18.17 in Business 515 Shares Share Tweet Share Save Bloomberg via Getty Images Google isn't the only Silicon Valley staple facing a lawsuit over the fairness of its hiring practices. The US Department of Labor has sued Oracle for allegedly conducting discriminatory employment practices. The enterprise tech giant is accused of paying white male workers more than minorities and women in similar positions, and of favoring Asian people for "technical roles." The lawsuit isn't coming out of the blue, though -- it's really the culmination of a battle that started when an investigation began in 2014. The Labor Department says that Oracle has refused to obey requests for employment data, such as discrimination complaints, hiring data and prior-year compensation levels. Compliance officials say they spent "almost a year" trying to solve discrimination issues before the lawsuit came about. It won't shock you at all to hear that Oracle disputes the claims. In a statement to USA Today, the company insists that the lawsuit is "politically motivated, based on false allegations, and wholly without merit." True or not, the stakes are high. Oracle is a government contractor, and that means it risks losing all its government contracts if it's found to be violating anti-discrimination rules. It may not have much choice but to turn over data and change its ways if it wants to avoid both losing a major customer and hurting its reputation.

By Douglas Rushkoff Updated 7:28 PM ET, Wed January 18, 2017 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. JUST WATCHED Should Trump be credited with new auto jobs? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Should Trump be credited with new auto jobs? 04:24 Story highlights Rushkoff: Trump's slamming companies over jobs prompts them to credit him for hiring Trump will need these staged wins to get a nation to borrow billions for infrastructure Douglas Rushkoff writes a regular column for CNN.com. He is a media theorist, the author of the book "Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus" and professor of media studies at CUNY/Queens. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. (CNN)The power of the tweet is in full force. Corporations give the appearance of buckling under pressure from Donald Trump to create more jobs in America. GM just announced it will be investing $1 billion more in US factories, and hiring as many as 7,000 workers over the next two years. Walmart claims it will add 10,000. But is this really what it seems? The GM deal "had been in the works for some time," a company spokeswoman explained, but "the timing was good for us to share what we are doing." Walmart had previously announced its plan, as well. In other words, these companies are throwing Donald Trump a bone by highlighting their plans to the American public so that they may be viewed as a sign that his campaign is working. JUST WATCHED Carrier employee: We feel lied to Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Carrier employee: We feel lied to 02:21 Welcome to the reality show that is fast replacing American business. The plot is repetitive. Trump tweets an angry, only half-accurate accusation against a company -- say, that GM makes the Chevy Cruze in Mexico, and if they don't move production to America, he'll slap a 35% tariff on their cars. Read More The stock goes down a percent or more. Then the company makes a symbolic display of allegiance, and Trump tweets his approval: "Thank you to General Motors and Walmart for starting the big jobs push back into the US." None of this matters, on a business level. These hirings represent shifts of labor as inconsequential as last month's announcement that Carrier -- thanks to "hard negotiations" by the President-elect -- would stop 800 whole jobs from going to Mexico. That's a drop in the bucket compared with the 5,000 private sector jobs Obama created daily -- if the total were averaged over his years in office -- 47% of which were in the "high wage" category, and none of which involved threatening tweets. JUST WATCHED Trump on bringing jobs back to America Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump on bringing jobs back to America 00:17 But there's a simple sense to Trump's approach to business. It's all about the sales job. It's not a question of real profitability, revenue, or trade imbalances so much as how we feel about them. For Trump, business is about instilling others with the faith they need to carry on. And this may just be the underlying fuel of capitalism. Trump is not as experienced in doing great, profitable business as he is in making people feel good about doing business with him. He has the heart and soul of a borrower. He knows how to sit around a table where he's the only one in debt, and somehow get the other guys to lend him even more money. He knows how to read a room, figure out what story those people need to hear, and then close the deal. JUST WATCHED Trump rips GM for making cars in Mexico Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump rips GM for making cars in Mexico 03:23 This is why Trump's business policies can only be understood through the lens of public relations. Mood over Moody's. Market sentiment, not market fundamentals. In his schema, it matters less how much money people are making or how secure their jobs really are than how much money they feel like they're making and how secure they believe their jobs to be. There may be no real defense against job-killing automation, outsourcing, and efficiencies. But a few big media-friendly, highly demonstrative job-saving gestures show these uneasy workers that someone in power is going to take care of them. Trump wants businesses to help him make America feel great again, and now those businesses are forced to decide whether and how far to play along. Companies may rightly fear a world in which their bottom lines can shift wildly on the basis of a single, untrue tweet. Some companies are already investing in emergency response plans in case Trump decides to tweet at them late one night. And the prospect of having to feign labor or other concessions in order to create the illusion of enduring domestic prosperity isn't pretty. Though, to be honest, if it works it could actually increase consumer confidence and get people spending again. This would then boost the economy, and create the very conditions we're pretending to celebrate. That's how salesmen like Trump bootstrap profit into existence. JUST WATCHED 'Hillbilly Elegy' author on Trump's job promises Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH 'Hillbilly Elegy' author on Trump's job promises 04:31 Trump is depending on those same sales tactics to win over a nation and Congress that have come to resist fiscal policy, instinctually. Trump will need these staged wins to convince a nation to borrow billions of dollars to spend on infrastructure jobs. It will require a real showman to instill such courage in the current environment of self-defeating austerity. It may take a little borrowing and investment to kickstart an economy while also building the infrastructure that will be necessary once it takes off. If so, then the people are going to need to take a leap of faith. Just like any professional salesman, Trump's biggest job is to get America to take that leap with him. And he's hoping to convince us the only way a professional debtor and television pitchman knows how -- by staging a reality show in which America's biggest businesses are the unwilling supporting cast.

New Delhi: India’s mobile app market grew sharply last year, outpacing the US, and ranked number one in terms of Google Play downloads, highlighting the vibrancy of the country’s mobile ecosystem. Indians downloaded over 6 billion apps in 2016, up from 3.5 billion in 2015. That 71% growth was significantly higher than the overall 15% growth in app downloads around the world. The findings are part of research firm App Annie’s fourth annual Retrospective Report released on Tuesday. “India’s phenomenal progress over the past two years is even more impressive when considering its potential for further gains. In 2016, India surpassed the US as the second largest smartphone market due in large part to a rise in domestically produced smartphones. This is only the beginning, however, as India’s smartphone penetration is still below 30% and its overall economy is poised for massive growth,” the report said. In 2016, according to the report, China became the largest market in terms of iOS App Store revenue. And while mature markets experienced strong growth in 2016, emerging markets, including India, Indonesia, Mexico and Brazil, saw even more impressive gains. The total time spent on apps rose significantly, especially in emerging markets, which accounted for four of the top five countries by total time spent in 2016. “In particular, India and Brazil stood out for their staggering growth in engagement. These increases stemmed from a combination of exploding user bases and increases in time spent per user (the latter of which also occurred in developed markets).” In India, in terms of number of downloads, social networking app Facebook, instant messaging app Whatsapp (also owned by Facebook) and mobile web browser UC Browser were the three most popular. Even, in terms of usage, calculated in terms of monthly active users both Facebook and Whatsapp maintained their top two positions respectively, while Google Maps was ranked number three. Based on revenue, video streaming app Netflix, which entered India a year ago, topped the list followed by online dating app Tinder and professional networking app Linkedin. App Annie’s revenue rankings are based on paid downloads and in-app purchases and exclude advertising. Globally, the typical smartphone user uses 30 apps every month. Gaming continued to be the biggest driver of downloads and revenue and one of the biggest headlines of 2016 was the phenomenal success of Pokémon GO, the latest mobile game offering from Niantic Inc., a company owned by Alphabet Inc.(formerly Google). “Despite launching in July, it remained in the top five apps for worldwide revenue in the last week of the year. And the year ended with the release of the much anticipated Super Mario Run, which became the #1 app in 148 countries,”the report said. Video streaming apps too saw a sharp growth in revenue. India has witnessed a dramatic shift in this segment over the past 6 months. Total time spent on the top 10 video streaming apps including Hotstar and Netflix on Android phones in India increased 600% between July and December 2016 compared to the same period a year ago, the report said. Overall, app publisher revenue grew 40% year-over-year–an acceleration over 2015’s growth rate–resulting in $35 billion across iOS and Google Play app stores. Including in-app advertising, app store revenue and third-party Android stores , publishers made over $89 billion in revenue, the report said. “App adoption is growing rapidly in emerging markets including India and Indonesia– while mature markets are seeing apps challenge and change traditional industries including retail, entertainment and banking,” said Danielle Levitas, senior vice-president of research at App Annie in an emailed statement.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars Follow us on social: AI A research scientist made an Alexa skill for keeping up with machine learning papers on arXiv Jordan Novet@jordannovet January 18, 2017 9:49 PM Tags: Alexa Skills, Amazon Alexa, ArXiv Every month, several thousand academic papers are uploaded to the website arXiv.org, which is maintained by the Cornell University Library. Among those documents are the latest developments in machine learning, and other areas of research. In December, 9,599 papers appeared on arXiv (pronounced “archive”), which works out to 309 papers per day on average. Among December’s postings: ProjectQ: An Open Source Software Framework for Quantum Computing, Brain-Swarm Interface (BSI): Controlling a Swarm of Robots with Brain and Eye Signals from an EEG Headset, and Unsupervised Video Segmentation via Spatio-Temporally Nonlocal Appearance Learning. These papers show up before getting peer-reviewed or published in prestigious journals. It is a veritable dumping ground for new, and recycled, ideas. Researchers at big companies like Facebook and Google post their latest on arXiv all the time, right alongside people working at universities around the world. It’s not easy to keep up with arXiv, because of the sheer volume and because the interface isn’t well suited for finding what’s relevant to you. There are no arXiv mobile apps — well, no official ones, anyway. So Amine Ben Khalifa, a research scientist at enterprise software company Workday, did the trendy thing and built an Alexa skill that lets you hear the titles, and even abstracts, of the 50 newest arXiv papers in the handful of research areas that are pertinent to him. So now he doesn’t have to set aside time every day to scan arXiv — he can just ask his Amazon Echo to tell him about stuff verbally. And if any papers sound interesting, he can review them in the Alexa app. This is not the first attempt to simplify arXiv monitoring. Andrej Karpathy, a prominent figure in artificial intelligence (AI) who works at OpenAI, in 2015 introduced Arxiv Sanity Preserver, which not only shows a nice and neat presentation of machine learning papers on arXiv but also offers recommendations based on the papers that you “save.” In fact, Arxiv Sanity Preserver served as inspiration for the Alexa skill, which goes by the name arxivML, Khalifa wrote in a Medium post. There is also SciRate, which was once described as “Digg for the arXiv.” ArxivML is among the more than 7,000 skills that are now available for Alexa. Meanwhile, Google, which fields the Google Home smart speaker that competes with the Echo, has been slowly rolling out “actions” for the Google Assistant that challenges Alexa.

A "yeasayer," on the other hand, is a person who is prone to expressing optimism. According to my assessment of the astrological omens, you can and should be a creative yeasayer in the coming days—both for the sake of your own well-being and that of everyone whose life you touch. For inspiration, study Upton Sinclair's passage about Beethoven: He was "the defier of fate, the great yea-sayer." His music is "like the wind running over a meadow of flowers, superlative happiness infinitely multiplied." THIS WEEK’s BIRTHDAYS: Jeff Brown, Siloën Daley, Benny Fong, Ryan Patey, Stephanie Clattenburg, Laura Walton Send your birthday wishes to bday@thecoast.ca. PISCES (February 19 - March 20) If I'm feeling prosaic, I might refer to a group of flamingos as a flock. But one of the more colourful and equally correct terms is a "flamboyance" of flamingos. Similarly, a bunch of pretty insects with clubbed antennae and big fluttery wings may be called a kaleidoscope of butterflies. The collective noun for zebras can be a dazzle, for pheasants a bouquet, for larks an exaltation and for finches a charm. In accordance with current astrological omens, I'm borrowing these nouns to describe members of your tribe. A flamboyance or kaleidoscope of Pisceans? Yes! A dazzle or bouquet or exaltation or charm of Pisceans? Yes! All of the above. ARIES (March 21-April 19) Are you more attracted to honing group dynamics or liberating group dynamics? Do you have more aptitude as a director who organizes people or as a sparkplug who inspires people? Would you rather be a chief executive officer or a chief imagination officer? Questions like these will be fertile for you to meditate on in the coming weeks. The astrological omens suggest it's time to explore and activate more of your potential as a leader or catalyst. TAURUS (April 20-May 20) An eccentric Frenchman named Laurent Aigon grew up near an airport, and always daydreamed of becoming a commercial pilot. Sadly, he didn't do well enough in school to fulfill his wish. Yet he was smart and ambitious enough to accomplish the next best thing: Assembling a realistic version of a Boeing 737 cockpit in his home. With the help of Google, he gathered the information he needed, and ordered most of the necessary parts over the internet. The resulting masterpiece has enabled him to replicate the experiences of being a pilot. It's such a convincing copy that he has been sought as a consultant by organizations that specialize in aircraft maintenance. I suggest you attempt a comparable feat, Taurus: Creating a simulated version of what you want. I bet it will eventually lead you to the real thing. GEMINI (May 21-June 20) The weather may be inclement where you live, so you may be resistant to my counsel. But I must tell you the meanings of the planetary omens as I understand them, and not fret about whether you'll act on them. Here's my prescription, lifted from Henry David Thoreau's Walden: "We need the tonic of wildness, to wade sometimes in marshes where the bittern and the meadow-hen lurk, and hear the booming of the snipe; to smell the whispering sedge where only some wilder and more solitary fowl builds her nest, and the mink crawls with its belly close to the ground." And why does Thoreau say we need such experiences? "We must be refreshed by the sight of inexhaustible vigour, to witness our own limits transgressed." CANCER (Jun 21-Jul 22) Welcome to the most deliciously enigmatic, sensually mysterious phase of your astrological cycle. To provide you with the proper non-rational guidance, I have stolen scraps of dusky advice from the poet Dansk Javlarna. Please read between the lines: 1. Navigate the ocean that roars within the seashell. 2. Carry the key, even if the lock has been temporarily lost. 3. Search through the deepest shadows for the bright light that cast them. 4. Delve into the unfathomable in wordless awe of the inexplicable. LEO (Jul 23-Aug 22) What exactly would a bolt of lightning taste like? I mean, if you could somehow manage to roll it around in your mouth without having to endure the white-hot shock. There's a booze manufacturer that claims to provide this sensation. The company known as Oddka has created Electricity Vodka, hard liquor with an extra fizzy jolt. But if any sign of the zodiac could safely approximate eating a streak of lightning without the help of Electricity Vodka, it would be you Leos. These days you have a special talent for absorbing and enjoying and integrating fiery inspiration. VIRGO (August 23-September 22) Eighteenth-century painter Joshua Reynolds said that a "disposition to abstractions, to generalizing and classification, is the great glory of the human mind." To that lofty sentiment, his fellow artist William Blake responded, "To generalize is to be an idiot; to particularize is the alone distinction of merit." So I may be an idiot when I make the following generalization, but I think I'm right: In the coming weeks, it will be in your best interests to rely on crafty generalizations to guide your decisions. Getting bogged down in details at the expense of the big picture—missing the forest for the trees—is a potential pitfall that you can and should avoid. LIBRA (September 23-October 22) Czech writer Bohumil Hrabal penned the novel Dancing Lessons for the Advanced in Age. It consists of one sentence. But it's a long, rambling sentence—117 pages' worth. It streams from the mouth of the narrator, who is an older man bent on telling all the big stories of his life. If there were ever to come a time when you, too, would have cosmic permission and a poetic license to deliver a one-sentence, 117-page soliloquy, Libra, it would be in the coming weeks. Reveal your truths! Break through your inhibitions! Celebrate your epic tales! (PS: Show this horoscope to the people you'd like as your listeners.) SCORPIO (October 23-November 21) When Pluto was discovered in 1930, astronomers called it the ninth planet. But 76 years later, they changed their mind. In accordance with shifting definitions, they demoted Pluto to the status of a mere "dwarf planet." But in recent years, two renowned astronomers at Caltech have found convincing evidence for a new ninth planet. Konstantin Batygin and Michael E. Brown are tracking an object that is much larger than Earth. Its orbit is so far beyond Neptune's that it takes 15,000 years to circle the sun. As yet it doesn't have an official name, but Batygin and Brown informally refer to it as Phattie. I bring this to your attention, Scorpio, because I suspect that you, too, are on the verge of locating a monumental new addition to your universe. SAGITTARIUS (November 22-December 21) The tomato and potato are both nightshades, a family of flowering plants. Taking advantage of this commonality, botanists have used the technique of grafting to produce a pomato plant. Its roots yield potatoes, while its vines grow cherry tomatoes. Now would be a good time for you to experiment with a metaphorically similar creation, Sagittarius. Can you think of how you might generate two useful influences from a single source? CAPRICORN (December 22-January 19) Some guy I don't know keeps sending me emails about great job opportunities he thinks I'd like to apply for: A technical writer for a solar energy company, for example, and a social media intern for a business that offers travel programs. His messages are not spam. The gigs are legitimate. And yet I'm not in the least interested. I already have several jobs I enjoy, like writing these horoscopes. I suspect that you, too, may receive worthy but ultimately irrelevant invitations in the coming days, Capricorn. My advice: If you remain faithful to your true needs and desires, more apropos offers will eventually flow your way. more articles in News + Opinion » Tags: Free Will Astrology Tweet Comments Subscribe to this thread: By Email Subscribing… With RSS Comment Add a comment Subscribe to this thread Latest in Free Will Astrology FREE WILL ASTROLOGY » Free Will Astrology posted by ROB BREZSNY, Jan 26/17 Risk your enthusiasm, Aries comments      0 FREE WILL ASTROLOGY » Free Will Astrology posted by ROB BREZSNY, Jan 12/17 Drop grudges, Leo comments      0 FREE WILL ASTROLOGY » Free Willl Astrology posted by ROB BREZSNY, Jan 5/17 Open your Book of Love, Gemini comments      0 FREE WILL ASTROLOGY » Free Will Astrology posted by ROB BREZSNY, Dec 22/16 Be an innovator, Gemini comments      0 FREE WILL ASTROLOGY » Free Will Astrology posted by ROB BREZSNY, Dec 15/16 Tap into your potential, Gemini comments      0 FREE WILL ASTROLOGY » Free Will Astrology posted by ROB BREZSNY, Dec 8/16 Purify, Taurus comments      0 More » Coast Top Ten Most Read Most Shared Most Discussed Editing the way journalists write about social justice   (City) CBC, please fire Randy Bachman   (Voice of the City) Living wage ordinance floated by Halifax council   (City) Union negotiations adding “significant” budget pressure   (City) The Halifax student behind @Trump_Regrets   (Reality Bites) Don’t encourage the edgy, white liberals running for council   (Voice of the City) Trumpism can take root in Canada, but not if we fight back   (Voice of the City) City councillor wants new flyer delivery regulations in HRM   (Reality Bites) Why the convention centre sucks, part 4   (Reality Bites) Halifax Pride stands at a crossroads   (Voice of the City) Why I choose not to celebrate Canada Day   (Voice of the City) Dead Wrong: Halifax's unsolved murders   (Justice) Encounters with The Sleep Watcher   (Justice) Canada Post wants to eliminate my job as a letter carrier.

Families of Orlando victims sue Facebook, Google, Twitter Noor Salman, 30, aided and abetted husband Omar Mateen in his attempt to provide material support to a terrorist organisation, federal prosecutors said. They also accuse her of obstructing justice by lying to authorities investigating the June 2016 massacre. Salman appeared in federal court in Oakland, California, in an orange jail uniform and remained silent. An attorney entered the not guilty pleas on her behalf. Salman, the first person charged by US authorities in connection with the attack, faces up to life in prison if convicted. Her husband was killed in a shootout with police after taking hostages during a three-hour standoff at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. Salman was not present during the shooting, which also left dozens wounded and intensified fears about attacks by Americans inspired by Islamic State, the militant organisation. Wife of Orlando nightclub gunman arrested A grand jury indictment unsealed on Tuesday accused her of criminal activity beginning as early as April, several months before the massacre, but did not give details on how she helped Mateen. Prosecutors did not disclose more information on Wednesday. Hearings will be held later regarding her legal representation, detention and expected transfer to Florida. Salman was arrested on Monday in California, where she was living with her mother in the San Francisco area. Mateen, 29, pledged allegiance to the leader of Islamic State during the shooting. He had been investigated twice by the FBI for possible connections with militant groups. Mateen, who lived in Fort Pierce, Florida, with Salman and their young son, was self-radicalized and acted alone without assistance or orders from abroad, according to US authorities. Salman, a US citizen and the daughter of parents who emigrated from the West Bank in 1985, was physically abused by Mateen, her uncle, Al Salman, told reporters on Tuesday. The uncle said she was innocent and had no idea of her husband’s plans.

Neill Elementary School and Neill Street as the first step towards reconciliation. We must know and understand our history or else we are doomed to repeat the mistakes. A quick Google search of A.W. Neill MP reveals several of his racist comments in the House of Commons debates. In 1936 when he opposed the right to vote for Japanese Canadians, he stated, “This is a white man’s country, and we want it left a white man’s country.” He also introduced a motion in 1938 to stop immigration from Japan. Also, Neill was an Indian agent who viewed indigenous children as convicts. Targeting and unjust uprooting is something that Indigenous peoples have also experienced and continue to experience. The NAJC has worked for 70 years, on human rights, redress, and sharing the story of the 22,000 innocent Canadians, children, women, and men, of Japanese ancestry who were unfairly stripped of their rights, their freedom, and their property. My mother’s side of the family settled in Cumberland in the 1800s. Their hard work and contributions to Canada were ignored when they were uprooted, dispossessed, and incarcerated in 1942. What the Canadian government did to their own citizens was wrong. There wasn’t any evidence of wrongdoing. The heads of the Canadian Army and RCMP told the government there wasn’t any need to target Canadians of Japanese ancestry. A.W. Neill was one of the fear-mongering MPs who encouraged the hate and supported the uprooting. With a change of name, Port Alberni has an opportunity to promote a welcoming, safe, inclusive community. It’s 2017 and we wouldn’t accept racial slurs on our schools and streets so why would we accept the name of someone who is known for his racism? Lorene Oikawa, vice-president, National Association of Japanese Canadians chair of NAJC Human Rights Committee ••• Understanding  needed from non-aboriginals To the Editor, My grandfather “so utterly despised the Indian Agent, I thought I might murder him!” he told my grandmother on the occasion of his resignation from the Royal Northwest Mounted Police in 1905, just five years after accepting his commission. Now, as a non-aboriginal living in Port Alberni’s deeply First Nations community and blessed with grandpa’s enormous respect and affection for First Nations, perhaps I harbour a unique sense of justice at the prospect of a name-change for A.W Neill Elementary School. For all I know, A.W Neill might’ve been the Indian Agent whose life was spared by grandpa’s better-self. Recent high school grads may pride themselves having learned what happened to aboriginal children at residential schools, but such knowledge is uselessly superficial if not accompanied by a deeper understanding of how it truly affected First Nations Peoples for generations. For that, students need to learn who First Nations Peoples really are and how their world-view differs from the Judeo-Christian superstitious traditions foisted on them by colonialists. Learning about First Nations is still a work in progress as aboriginal content in school curriculae is only a fairly recent addition. Meanwhile, how ironically outrageous is it to ignorantly expect First Nations parents (decendants of elders who suffered at Port Alberni’s residential school) to accept sending their children to a school named after an inveterate racist? To quote school trustee, Rosemarie Buchanan (AV News, Jan. 5): “We are an enlightened and better educated society now.” Let’s prove Port Alberni is part of this equation. Liz Stonard, Port Alberni ••• Roadside assistance was appreciated To the Editor, I want to express my gratitude to the kind gentleman who assisted me and my friend when we experienced car problems in Port Alberni over the Christmas period. We had just arrived in Port Alberni after a white-knuckle drive along slushy, pot-holed roads from Bamfield. We stopped to get a coffee but when we got back in the car, it wouldn’t start. A passerby who identified himself as David offered to help and spent almost 20 minutes to try to identify the problem. He discovered that the cables to the battery had become loose—- likely as a result of the jarring ride over the logging road—and he promptly used his tools to fix it. It is so nice that there are still people like him in the world who will offer to help out when they see someone in need.

Google and Facebook have crept up on the Pentagon and the Central Intelligence Agency – or Britain’s M16 and Germany’s BND – using their vast wealth to develop sophisticated technology that goes far beyond social media and is beginning to impinge on core issues of national defence. Prof Mary Cummings from Duke University said the two digital empires have acquired drone technologies that exceed anything available to the world’s most powerful intelligence agencies. “Sorry to drop that bombshell on you all", she told a panel on the Future of War at the World Economic Forum in Davos. These  “corporate states” – as she calls them – are the shadowy forces of globalisation, operating at levels that few understand, and they have until recently escaped serious scrutiny....

Send me a copy:   http://mybs.in/2USfHrj The Election Commission of India (ECI) on December 15 launched an app suite to integrate, organise, and streamline all of its web and mobile apps and utilities under one mobile application. Searchable as ‘ECI apps’ on Google’s Play store for download, this app suite provides all relevant information around the elections, national or state, in an intuitive and concise manner. The home screen consists of six self-explanatory icons -- electors, candidates, political party, media, election office and citizen. Apart from that, there are two sub-tabs on the bottom for information on Systematic Voters' Education and Electoral Participation (SVEEP) and for a video tutorial. One issue that we noticed in the app was that not all features were functioning so far and there were tabs that would open blank screen or show nothing at all. Also, there were a few features that might require to download and install some additional files directly from ECI, so they require special permissions from users to install. Another important thing that the app suite lacks is a search bar. There is no way you can search what you are looking for. Exploring each option to get what you need means it takes some time to find the information. Keeping in view that the app suite was launched just a few days ago, it is safe to say that the features, overall, look polished and migth become better with time.  "The ECI Apps suite has three broad key functions -- provide all the commonly used functionalities within the app, act as a store for various other apps which can be installed and uninstalled through the suite, and Act as a channel of communication proactively pushing relevant information to the various stakeholders," says the official app page on Play store. Till now, the app has been downloaded by 100-500 users and, based on their feedback, the app carries an average rating of 4.4 on Google Play Store. Also, the app can be downloaded only on devices running the Android platform and there is no news if the app will find its spot on other platforms like iOS, Windows, etc, anytime soon.

Keeping in view that the app suite was launched just a few days ago, it is safe to say that the features, overall, look polished and migth become better with time.  "The ECI Apps suite has three broad key functions -- provide all the commonly used functionalities within the app, act as a store for various other apps which can be installed and uninstalled through the suite, and Act as a channel of communication proactively pushing relevant information to the various stakeholders," says the official app page on Play store. Till now, the app has been downloaded by 100-500 users and, based on their feedback, the app carries an average rating of 4.4 on Google Play Store. Also, the app can be downloaded only on devices running the Android platform and there is no news if the app will find its spot on other platforms like iOS, Windows, etc, anytime soon.

Harris created a fake story about an electrical worker who stumbled upon stacked boxes of ballots marked for Hillary Clinton. It was eventually shared with 6 million people. GABRIELLA DEMCZUK NYT i By SCOTT SHANE New York Times LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story ANNAPOLIS, Md. It was early fall, and Donald Trump, behind in the polls, seemed to be preparing a rationale in case a winner like him somehow managed to lose. “I’m afraid the election is going to be rigged, I have to be honest,” the Republican nominee told a riled-up crowd in Columbus, Ohio. He was hearing “more and more” about evidence of rigging, he added, leaving the details to his supporters’ imagination. A few weeks later, Cameron Harris, a new college graduate with a fervent interest in Maryland Republican politics and a need for cash, sat down at the kitchen table in his apartment to fill in the details Trump had left out. In a dubious cyberart just coming into its prime, this bogus story would be his masterpiece. Harris started by crafting the headline: “BREAKING: ‘Tens of thousands’ of fraudulent Clinton votes found in Ohio warehouse.” It made sense, he figured, to locate this shocking discovery in the very city and state where Trump had highlighted his “rigged” meme. “I had a theory when I sat down to write it,” recalled Harris, a 23-year-old former college quarterback and fraternity leader, who graduated from Davidson College in May. “Given the severe distrust of the media among Trump supporters, anything that parroted Trump’s talking points people would click. Trump was saying ‘rigged election, rigged election.’ People were predisposed to believe Hillary Clinton could not win except by cheating.” A Facebook page for Harris shows he’s from Kings Mountain and went to Kings Mountain High School, in Cleveland County. A Davidson Wildcats football roster corroborates that. In a statement, a Davidson college spokesman said the school “works hard to create a culture of trust in which honesty and personal integrity are foundational.” “We hope that these values are instilled for life and we are disappointed when any alumnus falls short,” said Mark Johnson. facebook twitter email Share More Videos 5:49 Fayetteville police rescue woman and child from car trapped in flood waters live on Facebook Pause 1:16 Remembering Josue Javier Diaz 0:59 A Plus Garage Doors Puppy Bowl 0:56 Rea Road Hotel site controversy 1:15 Charlotte School of Law reopened Monday 0:35 Catholics gather in support against abortion 1:04 File video: Accused Rock Hill killer fires lawyer 1:34 Rock Hill parents of murder victim talk about how he tried to save his killer 3:36 Son Rae Carruth once wanted dead is making progress in physical therapy 1:20 File video: Rock Hill man pleads guilty in 2015 crime spree; prosecutors say he shot wrong man Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email Clinton: Fake news 'epidemic' is 'putting lives at risk' In her remarks at event the honoring outgoing Senate minority leader Harry Reid (D-NV) on Thursday, Hillary Clinton called fake news an “epidemic.” She went on to say “It is now clear that so-called fake news can have real world consequences." C-SPAN In a raucous election year defined by made-up stories, Harris was a home-grown, self-taught practitioner, a boutique operator with no ties to Russian spy agencies or Macedonian fabrication factories. As Trump takes office this week, the beneficiary of at least a modest electoral boost from a flood of fakery, Harris and his ersatz-news website, ChristianTimesNewspaper.com, make for an illuminating tale. Contacted by a reporter who had discovered an electronic clue that revealed his secret authorship of ChristianTimesNewspaper.com, he was wary at first, chagrined to be unmasked. “This topic is rather sensitive,” Harris said, noting that he was trying to build a political consulting business and needed to protect his reputation. But eventually he agreed to tell the story of his foray into fake news, a very part-time gig that he calculated paid him about $1,000 an hour in web advertising revenue. He seemed to regard his experience with a combination of guilt about having spread falsehoods and pride at doing it so skillfully. facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:16 Remembering Josue Javier Diaz Pause 5:49 Fayetteville police rescue woman and child from car trapped in flood waters live on Facebook 0:59 A Plus Garage Doors Puppy Bowl 3:36 Son Rae Carruth once wanted dead is making progress in physical therapy 0:35 Catholics gather in support against abortion 2:07 Dale Earnhardt Jr. can't wait to go racing 0:56 Rea Road Hotel site controversy 2:56 Hornets to offer scholarships 1:21 UNC's Meeks on starting strong but falling behind to Miami 2:26 UNC's Berry talks about learning from loss to Miami Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email Man opens fire at DC pizzeria over fake news story A man from Salisbury, North Carolina who said he was investigating a conspiracy theory about Hillary Clinton running a child sex ring out of a pizza restaurant in Washington, D.C fired a gun inside Comet Ping Pong but did not injure anyone, according to p footage by WJLA via AP; edited by Meta Viers/McClatchy At his kitchen table that night in September, Harris wondered: Who might have found these fraudulent Clinton ballots? So he invented “Randall Prince, a Columbus-area electrical worker.” This Everyman, a “Trump supporter” whose name hinted at a sort of nobility, had entered a little-used back room at the warehouse and stumbled upon stacked boxes of ballots pre-marked for Clinton, Harris decided. “No one really goes in this building. It’s mainly used for short-term storage by a commercial plumber,” Prince said. In case anyone missed the significance of the find, Harris made it plain: “What he found could allegedly be evidence of a massive operation designed to deliver Clinton the crucial swing state.” A photograph, he thought, would help erase doubts about his yarn. With a quick Google image search for “ballot boxes,” he landed on a shot of a balding fellow standing behind black plastic boxes that helpfully had “Ballot Box” labels. It was a photo from The Birmingham Mail, showing a British election 3,700 miles from Columbus – but no matter. In the caption, the balding Briton got a new name: “Mr. Prince, shown here, poses with his find, as election officials investigate.” The article explained that “the Clinton campaign’s likely goal was to slip the fake ballot boxes in with the real ballot boxes when they went to official election judges on November 8th.” Then Harris added a touch of breathlessness. “This story is still developing,”he wrote, “and CTN will bring you more when we have it.” Shared with 6 million He pushed the button and the story was launched on Sept. 30, blazing across the web like some kind of counterfeit comet. “Even before I posted it, I knew it would take off,” Harris recalled. He was correct. The ballot box story, promoted by a half-dozen Facebook pages Harris had created for the purpose, flew around the web, fueled by indignant comments from people who were certain that Clinton was going to cheat Trump of victory and who welcomed the proof. It was eventually shared with 6 million people, according to CrowdTangle, which tracks web audiences. The next day, the Franklin County, Ohio, board of elections announced that it was investigating and that the fraud claims appeared to be untrue. Within days, Ohio’s secretary of state, Jon Husted, issued a statement to deny the story. “A Christian myself, I take offense to reading such unbelievable lies from a publication alleging Christian ties,” Husted said. There was nothing especially Christian about his efforts, Harris admits; he had simply bought the abandoned web address for $5 at ExpiredDomains.net. Within a few days, the story, which had taken him 15 minutes to concoct, had earned him about $5,000. That was a sizable share of the $22,000 an accounting statement shows he made during the presidential campaign from ads for shoes, hair gel and web design that Google had placed on his site. He had put in perhaps half an hour a week on the fake news site, he said, for a total of about 20 hours. He would come close to a far bigger payday, one that might have turned the $5 he had spent on the Christian Times domain into more than $100,000. Money, not politics The money, not the politics, was the point, he insisted. He needed to pay his living expenses. “I spent the money on student loans, car payments and rent,” he said. By the time he launched his fraudulent story on ballot fraud, he had found minimal success with “Hillary Clinton Blames Racism for Cincinnati Gorilla’s Death,” a reference to the sad tale of Harambe, the gorilla shot after he grabbed a little boy visiting the zoo. He had done better with “Early Morning Explosion in DC Allegedly Leaves Yet Another DNC Staffer Dead,” spinning off conspiracy theories around the earlier shooting death of a Democratic National Committee staff member. Later, he would tell gullible readers “NYPD Looking to Press Charges Against Bill Clinton for Underage Sex Ring,” “Protesters Beat Homeless Veteran to Death in Philadelphia” and “Hillary Clinton Files for Divorce in New York Courts.” Eight of his stories would merit explicit debunking by Snopes.com, the myth-busting site, but none would top the performance of the ballot box fantasy. President Barack Obama thought the fake news phenomenon significant enough to mention it as a threat to democracy in his farewell speech in Chicago last week. “Increasingly,” he said, “we become so secure in our bubbles that we start accepting only information, whether it’s true or not, that fits our opinions, instead of basing our opinions on the evidence that is out there.” That was exactly the insight on which Harris said he built his transient business: that people wanted to be fed evidence, however implausible, to support their beliefs. “At first it kind of shocked me – the response I was getting,” he said. “How easily people would believe it. It was almost like a sociological experiment,” added Harris, who majored in political science and economics. By his account, though he voted for Trump, his early preference had been for Sen. Marco Rubio. Harris said he would have been willing to promote Clinton and smear Trump had those tactics been lucrative. But as other seekers of clicks discovered, Trump’s supporters were far more fervent than Clinton’s. A costly mistake In late October, with the inevitable end of his venture approaching, Harris sought an appraisal for the web domain that by then had vaulted into the web’s top 20,000 sites. An appraiser said that given the traffic, he could probably sell it for between $115,000 and $125,000. But Harris made a costly mistake: He decided to wait. Days after the election, denounced for making the peddling of fake news remunerative, Google announced that it would no longer place ads on sites promoting clearly fabricated stories. A few days later, when Harris checked his site, the ads were gone. He checked with the appraiser and was told that the domain was now essentially worthless. All was not lost, however. He had put a pop-up on the site inviting visitors to “join the ‘Stop the Steal’ team to find out HOW Hillary plans to steal the election and what YOU can do to stop her!” and collected 24,000 email addresses. He has not yet decided what to do with them, he said. Asked whether he felt any guilt at having spread lies about a presidential candidate, Harris grew thoughtful. But he took refuge in the notion that politics is by its nature replete with exaggerations, half-truths and outright whoppers, so he was hardly adding much to the sum total. “Hardly anything a campaign or a candidate says is completely true,” he said. Lately he has picked up Trump’s refrain that mainstream news organizations are themselves regular purveyors of fake news. Last week, when BuzzFeed released what it called an “explosive but unverified” dossier suggesting that Russia had planned to bribe and blackmail Trump, Harris wrote on Twitter: “Explosive but unverified” – “That could describe every fake news headline ever.” He did not mention his own expertise in the field. Observer staff writer Ely Portillo contributed. Cameron Harris, a recent Davidson College graduate, created a fake story that was eventually shared with 6 million people.

The company provides reputation management through close review monitoring, directory listing management and social media marketing. High Level, Canada - January 18, 2017 /PressCable/ -- Strategic Local Marketing, a digital marketing agency based in High Level, Alberta, launched a variety of local online marketing solutions including reputation management, directory listings management, and social media marketing. More information is available at http://strategiclocalmarketing.ca. Online marketing has grown considerably over the past decade, as more and more businesses look for solutions to promote their services through the extremely potent medium of the internet. Recent reports show that up to 90% of all clients have used online reviews or Google searches to find both online and offline businesses and services. The business implications of this statistic are enormous. Businesses without online visibility could see significant growth by investing in digital marketing, especially since social media and search engine use are expected to grow in the near future. Online reputation is essential for business success, as review sites and social media platforms provide means through which clients can gather information about different businesses and services. Traditional, aggressive ad-based campaigns are no longer as effective as in the past, as almost 90% of internet users claim they do not trust online ads. By contrast, reputation-based sources such as reviews or forums are trusted by more than 70% of internet consumers. Strategic Local Marketing launched a variety of local marketing solutions for businesses looking to improve their reputation, increase their visibility across social platforms, and grow organically in local searches. The Canadian digital marketing company offers comprehensive reputation management services for both local and global businesses. The company gives its clients the possibility to monitor business reviews across all review platforms, generate reviews through professional forms, and efficiently monitor the competition.

According to new reports, the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P owners are now claiming that their devices have some problems after updating their handsets to the new operating system. Users claim that they have issues when trying to connect the car with the in-car Bluetooth systems. Many of them have already reported these problems on Google’s forums, but until now, the big search engine company has not indicated that it is working on a fix. According to GSMArena this problem dates since October 2016, when Android Nougat was still in BETA. In other words, the developers have failed to solve this issue before releasing the new OS to the public and now, 3 months after the release of the new OS, this problem still exists. The Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P have just received the Android 7.1.1 Nougat, which means that the Android team might actually fix this Bluetooth bug. We remind you that the Nexus 6 also has some issues with the speakerphone when users are trying to make a phone call, as they keep hearing echoes and other noises that that it impossible to conduct a conversation. Now, everyone is asking if their Nexus 6 will receive a fix for this issue, because the handset is already at the end of its software support cycle, meaning that there are high chances that the device will remain with this problem forever. On the other hand, the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P have been released in September 2015, which means that these two devices still have about 8 months left of software support. Do you own a Nexus 5X or Nexus 6P handset? Have you found a way to fix this problem on your device?

Nexus 6P vs LG V20 vs Zenfone AR – Which One Is Worth It? By Christopher McCandles / January 17, 2017 / Phones No Comments on Nexus 6P vs LG V20 vs Zenfone AR – Which One Is Worth It? 147 ASUS just attended CES 2017 and that’s where the company decided to unveil its new Zenfone AR. The device will ship with a 5.7 inch display, meaning that it’s going to go against a tough crowd. Today we’ll take Zenfone AR and compare it against Nexus 6P and LG V2 which are the top dogs of the 5.7 inch smartphone department. Design Nexus 6P ships with a premium looking aluminum chassis, while the other two are equipped with an all-metal body. Even though Zenfone AR has a metal chassis, it’s still the lightest among them but that pales in comparison with LG V20’s innovative design. LG managed to create a sleek design that’s also very rough, resisting drops from up to 4 feet. As previously mentioned, all of them feature a 5.7 inch display but the Zenfone AR comes with the best one because it uses Super AMOLED technology. Hardware Specs In terms of hardware performances ASUS Zenfore AR is the best one by far. The reason behind this is that ASUS equipped the device with a powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor that’s paired with the staggering amount of 8GB of RAM. In comparison LG V20’s 4GB of RAM and Nexus 6P’s 3GB, Zenfone AR blows them out of the water. Features The main key selling point Nexus 6P brings to the table is that Google is the company directly in charge of its, thus meaning that it receives Android updates ahead of everyone else. This comes in quite useful since Google keeps launching great Android features every month and being able to get your hands on them is rather important. One of LG V20’s strongest points is the fact that it comes with dual-lens 16MP rear camera that features OIS and LED flash but that pales in comparison with Zenfone AR’s 23MP camera which features 4-axis OIS and 3X Zoom. Alongside, the very impressive camera specs, another key selling point of Zenfone AR is that it’s the first smartphone to ship with Tango-Daydream compatibility. Having access to virtual reality content and augmented reality features is what makes Zenfone AR so highly desirable. Although the device has just been unveiled, ASUS has yet to announce the device’s official price.

Even before Donald Trump was elected, the US was already in a “golden age of surveillance“. As Edward Snowden revealed in 2013, the US government’s surveillance powers had expanded dramatically under the Obama administration. Trump has repeatedly signalled that he intends to make much greater use of these capabilities – perhaps inspired by British legislation that has given the UK government unprecedented power to snoop on its citizens. In both cases, such powers were ostensibly introduced to combat terrorism. But there’s very little evidence that greater spying powers actually catch terrorists, many of whom already know how to evade spooks. On the other hand, there is mounting concern among privacy advocates and human rights campaigners that such powers will stifle domestic dissent and enable political witch-hunts. “It’s not the government you have now that’s the issue,” says Harry Halpin of the World Wide Web Consortium. “It’s the government you might have in the future. In the US, everyone said, well the NSA isn’t so bad, Obama is such a rational guy. Now we have Trump wanting to create a database of Muslims.” So how will the state’s creeping expansion of its eavesdropping capabilities affect the right to protest? The UK’s Investigatory Powers Act – known as the “snoopers’ charter” – goes far beyond what even the US has made legal, granting government authority to force internet service providers (ISPs) to collect information on their users, and the ability to hack into devices on very broad warrants. Most people are not against the idea of targeted surveillance to bring down terror plots, for example, says Adrian Kennard who runs Andrews & Arnold, a small, privacy-oriented ISP in the UK. The problem is, the UK’s targets are not “targeted” at all – the focus could be “everyone in Manchester”, Kennard says. “Or they might decide to target everyone connected to a BT broadband line.” Trump is certain to take inspiration from the UK, says Danny O’Brien of the Electronic Frontier Foundation in San Francisco. The US and UK are already planning to weaken the protections on cross-border access to data, he says, allowing UK law enforcement to seize communications from Google and Facebook without a US warrant – and vice versa. Whether or not he pushes for new rules, Trump is very unlikely to roll back any existing measures. No one else will, either. Overreach in other spheres could plausibly be reversed in future, but powers of surveillance are in political terms nearly impossible to roll back: not only are they seductive, but no government wants to be accused of being soft on security. At risk Legal challenges to such powers are being mounted on both sides of the Atlantic. But the bottom line is that online privacy looks set to be fatally eroded. So what’s really so bad about Donald Trump and UK prime minister Theresa May riffling through your computer and your communications? After all, if you’re not a terrorist, you have nothing to fear, right? This view is desperately naive, says Halpin. “If you think you have nothing to hide, you probably do,” he says. “And if you think you haven’t broken any laws, I promise that you have.” One concern is that poorly framed or antiquated laws can be used as a pretext to prosecute or harass anyone who falls foul of powerful interests – much as they have previously been used to prosecute hackers. In the US, one such law could be the arcane Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, created in 1986, which makes it a federal crime to access a computer in a manner that “exceeds authorized access”. Companies have occasionally used the CFAA to bring civil suits against competitors, but the real threat goes far beyond that, because it can criminalise violations of websites’ terms of service – even something as trivial as lying on a dating website, says Esha Bandari, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which is challenging the law. Whether violations are pursued is “at the mercy of prosecutors’ discretion,” she says. Just because they haven’t exercised that discretion until now doesn’t mean they won’t: “That makes the law open to discriminatory enforcement,” she says. In this light, what is dangerous about bulk data collection is that it makes fishing expeditions possible, says Jim Killock from the UK’s Open Rights Group. All this data is kept somewhere, forever. “They can search and process that data to get new and interesting material, and decide whether you’re a suspect for something. It’s quite chilling,” he says. Is this possible to avoid? “The answer is not to have the data in the first place, so there’s nothing to store,” says Ben Laurie, head of security at Google DeepMind, who is also a director at the Open Rights Group. Security experts point to the Tor network, which anonymises and encrypts your trail through the internet. But it might not be so simple. “Under the IP act, using Tor will put a target on your back,” says Killock. Trump’s proposed CIA boss has called the use of encryption a “red flag”. Once flagged, bulk hacking powers include a provision to break into your device and slurp up its contents. A “virtual private network” might seem a better idea, but only if you are choosy about which one you use: not all will keep your data away from governments. Switzerland, for example, might be a good place to stash money, but has a data-sharing agreement with the US. VPN providers based in the Netherlands or Germany offer stronger protection under their national privacy laws. And even the most secure VPN is going to do little good if the computer you are using is open to attacks. The Apple ecosystem is generally more likely to protect privacy; while Google’s security is excellent, its implementations vary by hardware. That makes an iPhone a better bet for security than an Android device. The software you use matters, too. Secure chat services may not be that secure. Whether or not Telegram was really hacked by Russian authorities, Halpin says his group has also broken the protocol. WhatsApp also appears vulnerable. “I recommend people use Signal,” he says. “It’s the most reliable and secure peer-reviewed text messaging app.” “Trying to evade snooping by using Tor or encryption might put a target on your back” As for email, Halpin suggests using RiseUp.Net, if you are concerned about snoopers. “They have no history of complying with requests for email. Lots of high-risk people go there,” he says. The rest of us could do worse than Gmail. “Google has been resistant to court orders it finds overreaching,” claims Laurie. Even if civil society has trouble mobilising against a surveillance state, all is not lost. Even now, Halpin says the W3C and other groups that run the infrastructure of the internet are teaming up with companies like Apple and Google to bake these security enhancing protocols in by default. “Making encrypted software easier for the average person to use is a civic responsibility,” he says. The real resistance may just be getting started.

T-Mobile has announced a new update for its LG V20 that bumps the phone to software version H91810j. According to T-Mo, the update includes Android security patches from Google, a fix for an Android Pay bug, and an audio quality patch. TmoNews reader Stephen received this update on his V20 this morning. The update weighs in at 583.3MB and brings the phone’s Android security patch level to December 1, 2016. This update may not be a bump up to Android 7.1.1 like some owners were hoping for, but at least it does improve the security of T-Mobile’s LG V20. The update should be rolling out over the coming days, so you can either wait for it to hit your device or check for it manually by going into Settings > General > About phone > Update Center > System update > Check for update. Thanks, Stephen! Source: T-Mobile Tags: Android, LG, LG V20 About Alex Wagner Editorial Director of News and Content for PhoneDog Media. Fluent in whisk(e)y, video games, and phones.

Very big update but still downloading it. Hopefully it improves on the last update and makes things a bit much quicker. Although I must say, I am highly awaiting the successor to this great phone. The LG V20 is a workhorse and it gets things done as far productivity goes. If the upcoming LG G6 is any indication of what we could expect with the LG V30, I’m all in. Great phone. One of my top favorites from the last quarter releases. Daniel Tiberius It mentioned an audio quality patch too. Anyone know what that is specifically? Daniel Armstrong There is an issue with the main speaker or its amp overloading and causing popping noises during volume peaks. Happens on my US-996 often and a power cycle fixes it. Daniel Tiberius I never noticed it on mine luckily. Thanks for the heads up Daniel! Bella This sure lower my audio on my phone ..smh wilfredo sandoval I just downloaded mine haven’t noticed any changes yet let’s see tomorrow Sushimane Anyone have the problem with headphone? I plug in my head phones all the way in but and when i play music or watch youtube the sound still come out of the speaker. Is there a special headphone i need to get to get the hifi to work out something? I have the b&o headphone. Corey Jalette Try cleaning out the headphone jack. Used to happen to me all the time with a lot of phones. Just get a q tip and gently swirl around to get dust. Hope this helps! Sushimane Ok thanks Miguel Gatchalian Insert the 3.5mm jack until you hear the click sound. Sushimane88 I did that too the hifi symbol would come on but some times it doesnt. Skinny Foley Where’s the Nougat update for the Galaxy S7? Probably come out after the S8 is released. Trevnerdio Praise the Lord, finally! Of course though, check for updates and it says none available…LG Bridge, here I come… jdrch Stuck on 7.0 while my S5 is running 7.1.1. Yikes. Doug Baker Ever since I updated the T-Mobile app has been draining the crap out of my battery.

The site brings together content that previously existed in scattered locations, while also continuing to add new content from the archives. “We did such a good job bragging internally about all these wonderful resources of content, and how more people were finding the museum’s website via Google searches because they’d find the content than were just going to our homepage,” said Jim Mathieu, the director of Digital Media at the Penn Museum. “And that was the moment that just spurred our director to say, ‘Well, let’s put it all under one portal.’” The launch of Digital Penn Museum also honors what Application Developer Michael Condiff describes as “part of the mission of the museum to educate and inform.” Condiff said he is not concerned that the free access to museum collections will result in a loss of revenue for the museum. If anything, Condiff said, “this is the best free advertising.” “We think more is better,” Condiff said. “Having pictures of the sphinx on our website isn’t going to discourage people from coming and viewing it. You could make the case that people have discovered a whole lot of things that they might want to come here and research, or they might want to see what’s going on in our Egyptian gallery, and then something might really strike you, and you might want to come here and view it.” The collections database showcases 877,556 of the estimated 1 million objects the museum stores. The site has 2,000 articles from Expedition Magazine, 45 legacy websites that have been migrated, and over 1,124 archival videos. RELATED:  How a Penn Museum expert ties ancient writing to desserts Penn Museum celebrates life and myth of King Midas Only half of 1 percent of the approximately 1 million objects — 5,000 objects — can be displayed at the museum at a given time. Had researchers previously wanted to access objects the Penn Museum had in storage, they would have needed to submit a special request for a staff member to supervise the visit because the vast majority of the museum’s objects were not on display. Now, researchers can use the database to view the various objects online, sorted by collection. “It’s so much more efficient for everyone involved because it doesn’t mean that our staff has to babysit people when they’re discovering things,” Mathieu said. “They can actually cater to them when they found what they wanted, which is provided.” One of the most rewarding aspects of this project, Condiff said, comes from the response to many of the archival films, which include time logs that date back decades. “When people are just thankful that they can see the place that they live in from 1950 and they don’t have a big frame of reference, I think that’s when I was like, ‘Oh, wow. At that point it is global,” Condiff said. “Somebody from the place that we put up a video on is saying, ‘Hey, this is awesome. Thank you for doing this.’’” All comments eligible for publication in The Daily Pennsylvanian.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Sunday January 29, 2017 News Larger / SmallerNight Mode ON THE BEAT: Take a trip down Road Rules Lane Anthony Jory 19 Jan 2017, 1:51 p.m. On the Beat with senior constable Anthony Jory. It’s time for another “On the Beat” I know you want this episode to be jam packed full of exciting and innovative idea’s in relation to crime and crime prevention. You crave for an episode that will delve into the psyche of the criminal. An episode that explains in an easy to understand plain English way everything that you will need to know on the subject that will make you a crime prevention guru, however this is not the episode that will do all those things, today I will delve into the magical world of traffic. Traffic is defined in one of the dictionaries found on the Google net as: The vehicles, persons,etc moving in an area, along a street, etc. If you look outside into your street you will see traffic. If we think about traffic we usually think about the gridlock on the Princes Hwy or other major thoroughfares, however you need to think about the back roads as well. By back roads I mean your street where you live. You may have a stop sign at the end of your street that you have driven past 10,000 times on your way to work. "Today I will delve into the magical world of traffic. - Senior constable Anthony Jory You used to stop every single time at the intersection in the early days but it has been your experience that there is no traffic early in the morning so you just slow down now when you get to the intersection to save time. If I have just described something that you do, then I must warn you that you may at some time make a mistake by not stopping at that intersection which could have fatal consequences either. You know how to drive and what a stop sign or a give way sign means. But there a many people that do not obey road signs. At a stop sign you must not only stop your vehicle, but when it is safe to do so you are to proceed with safety across the intersection. At a give way sign you are to give way. Not try and beat the oncoming car. This may be basic knowledge but I see many drivers breaking the rules and tempting fate in my travels. It’s not only on our highways. Bad driving occurs near our homes, schools and daycare centres. There is one very simple way getting rid of the problem. Obey the road rules. As always, in case of emergency, call (000) Non emergencies contact Police Link on 131444 or your local police.

up next: now reading: Why Tax Reform Is Going to Be a Slog CSM Why Tax Reform Is Going to Be a Slog By Robert Samuelson January 19, 2017 CSM X Story Stream recent articles Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Tax "reform," starting with taxes on business, seems to be on everyone's agenda, and it may be a place where the incoming Trump administration and its Democratic critics find common ground. But it's still going to be a slog, and one reason is so-called "pass-through" businesses whose taxes are levied at personal income tax rates. When we think of business, the image that usually pops to mind is of the giant corporation: Google, General Motors, Procter & Gamble and their ilk. To be sure, these massive enterprises (known as "C" corporations) seem to dominate the business landscape and have their own tax rules, with a top federal rate of 35%. But behind the gigantic companies lie millions of smaller firms that aren't C corporations. Their profits are "passed through" to the owners' personal tax forms, where their business income is taxed at personal tax rates. The top federal rate is 43.4%, but the inclusion of state taxes can push that above 50%. Given the popularity of pass-through firms, they will likely play a big role in the tax debate. It also seems likely that they'll push for lower taxes. This could be a major stumbling block, because (of course) tax cuts for pass-through firms will require spending cuts, tax increases on big C corporations, or larger budget deficits. How many pass-through firms are there and what's their economic effect? You can be excused if you underestimate their impact. I certainly did. But a new report from the Tax Foundation, a think tank, dispels any notion that pass-through firms play a minor role in the economy. Here are some findings from the report: *     More than 90% of businesses in America are pass-through enterprises. In 2014, that was 28.3 million out of 30.8 million business establishments. *     Pass-through firms account for more than half of U.S. private-sector employment. In 2014, the number of workers at these firms totaled 73 million compared with 54 million at C corporations. *     The total profits of pass-through firms have surpassed the profits of C corporations. In 2012, the net income was $1.6 trillion for pass-through firms and $1.1 trillion for C corporations. Pass-through businesses come in three varieties: sole proprietorships (firms with one owner); partnerships; and "S" corporations, which are corporations receiving pass-through tax treatment. Their number has grown rapidly. In 1980, the Tax Foundation reports, there were more C corporation tax returns filed than the combined total of sole proprietorships, partnerships and S  corporations. By 2012, the number of pass-through returns was more than four times greater than the returns from C corporations. It's not entirely clear what explains this surge. One cause was the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which lowered the top personal rate to 28% from 50%; that created a powerful incentive for firms to adopt pass-through status, especially with a higher top tax rate for C corporations. But as personal tax rates have been raised, this incentive weakened. The top personal and business rates are now near or above 50%, including state taxes. (The top federal corporate rate is 35%; but there are also taxes on dividends and capital gains, with a top tax rate of 23.8%.) Another explanation for the popularity of pass-through status is the spread of limited-liability company laws in states, which allow firms to curtail damages in case they're sued, says the Tax Foundation's Scott Greenberg. Rather than facing two types of taxation — corporate and personal — business owners may simplify by choosing personal tax rates. Whatever the explanation, the many pass-through taxpayers loom over the impending tax reform debate. Interestingly, the Tax Foundation suggests that the pass-through treatment should remain because it doesn't discriminate against labor income. It is "difficult to justify why income from pass-through businesses should be subject to lower tax rates than income from wages and salaries," the report says. No way will this be easy — and it's not clear that overhauling business and personal taxes separately will make it any easier.

Nintendo has neither forgotten nor abandoned you. While it may seem that way as it has been more than a month since Super Mario Run landed on iOS, the feisty Italian plumber will be searching for his princess on Google’s platform really soon now. And by “soon”, we mean “in two months. Nintendo has teased on Twitter that Super Mario Run will be coming to Android some time in March. This year, of course. Provided there aren’t any more delays. While Miitomo is technically Nintendo’s first mobile “game”, many consider Super Mario Run as the first real game coming from the gaming giant. And quite appropriately too, given how Mario is one of Nintendo’s most iconic properties. The others being Zelda and Link, which still have to make their way to mobile in any official capacity. Pokemon, dear friends, is not a Nintendo property, strictly speaking. Super Mario Run, however, turned out to be rather controversial. One won’t be able to deny how the game has really been designed from the ground up for mobile use. It isn’t simply a port of an existing title. To that extent, Nintendo does deserve some applause for a job well done. The $10 price, however, has been universally derided. To be clear, the game is “free to start”, in Nintendo’s own marketing words. We have other terms for that, like “trialware” or “free to play with IAPs”. Call it what you wish, the fact is that if you want to finish the game, or even just get past the beginning levels, you’ll have to pay $9.99. Whether the game, in spite of its agreeable design, is really worth that much, is the topic of much debates and hurt feelings. Nintendo hasn’t backed down from that position, sadly, so Android users will get their turn in the pulling of hair and gnashing of teeth. Chances are, however, some will still end up paying that tax anyway. No exact date for the launch, but if you pre-register, you will get an e-mail telling you about it.

Trump Backers Favored Fox; Clinton Supporters Favored CNN And MSNBC By Marcy Kreiter @marcykreiter On 01/18/17 AT 9:04 PM Close Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton supporters got their news from very different sources during the election campaign, a Pew Research Center poll indicated Wednesday. Fox News Channel dominated the coverage, with 19 percent of voters saying they relied on the cable network for information, followed by CNN at 13 percent, Facebook at 8 percent and local television stations at 7 percent. Only 6 percent of voters said they relied on the New York Times or local newspapers. A majority of voters (54 percent) said they got most of their news from television. Eighteen percent said they got their political fix from Google News, followed by the Huffington Post (17 percent), Yahoo (12 percent), BuzzFeed (7 percent), Breitbart (6 percent) or the Drudge Report (6 percent). Forty percent of Trump-backers said they got their election news from Fox News Channel compared to 3 percent of Clinton voters. Eight percent of Trump supporters got their news from CNN and 7 percent from Facebook. Clinton supporters were more inclined to get their information from CNN (19 percent), MSNBC (9 percent), Facebook (8 Percent), local TV (8 percent) and NPR (7 percent). Related Stories If Facebook and Google Can’t Stop Fake News, Maybe This 19-Year-Old Can Pakistan Threatens Nuclear Attack On Israel Newspapers didn’t show up as an information source at all among Trump supporters while 5 percent of Clinton voters said they relied on the New York Times and 4 percent looked to local newspapers. Pew noted that though digital media, though they played a major role in the campaign, did not show up as a main source of news for either group. Breitbart, an early supporter of Trump, was cited by just 1 percent of those surveyed as a main news source while BuzzFeed, which broke a number of stories during the campaign, was not cited by any of the respondents. The Huffington Post, which initially said it would cover the Trump campaign on its entertainment pages and attached notes to stories about his labeling him a “liar,” was cited by only 1 percent of those queried. The survey queried 4,183 adults Nov. 29-Dec. 12 and had an error rate of 2.7 percentage points. Join the Discussion Most Read Everything You Need To Know, Right Now.

Pandey NEW DELHI: January 19, 2017 00:00 IST Updated: January 19, 2017 04:19 IST Share Article PRINT A A A The Central Bureau of Investigation has initiated a preliminary enquiry against Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia.   Devesh K. Pandey NEW DELHI: January 19, 2017 00:00 IST Updated: January 19, 2017 04:19 IST Kejriwal targets Prime Minister, alleges that the agency is being used as BJP is losing in Goa and Punjab The Central Bureau of Investigation has initiated a preliminary enquiry against Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia and unknown public servants for alleged violation of rules and regulations in awarding a contract for “Talk-to-AK” social media campaign. The agency launched another enquiry into the appointment of Delhi Health Minister Satyendra Jain’s daughter as the adviser in the Health Department. “The probe has been started in both matters on the basis of complaints lodged by the Delhi government’s Deputy Secretary (Vigilance),” said a CBI official. Internal mechanism A preliminary enquiry is an institutionalised internal mechanism of the CBI whereby the agency verifies whether a proper regular case into the allegations can be made out. The first preliminary enquiry pertains to the campaign launched in July last year and a dedicated website was also created for the purpose. “We have instituted a preliminary enquiry against Mr. Sisodia and unknown government officials to probe the allegations that there were improprieties and violation of existing rules and regulations in the award of a work contract for ‘Talk-to-AK’ social media campaign on Google, Facebook and YouTube to reach out to people across the country. The campaign was to be implemented in two phases,” said the official. The official said the Delhi government’s Principal Secretary had raised objections. However, the matter was put up before the Council of Ministers for an “ex post facto” approval for the execution of work and release of funds to the consultant hired for the purpose. “One Perfect Relations Pvt. Limited was hired as a consultant for the work. The Delhi Cabinet gave approval to the proposal involving expenditures to the tune of Rs. 1.5 crore,” said the official. According to the CBI, the consultant had released the payments for the execution of work, “creating a liability” on the Delhi government. The CBI move triggered a sharp reaction from Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who, through his Twitter handle, targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi alleging that the agency was being used because the BJP was losing in Goa and Punjab. “It seems Modiji has gone haywire. The country’s Prime Minister has got no other job left…,” he tweeted in Hindi. He also expressed apprehension of CBI searches at the Delhi Secretariat and Mr. Sisodia’s office on Thursday. Mr. Sisodia tweeted: “Welcome to the battleground Modiji. I will wait for your CBI at my home and office tomorrow morning.” Second enquiry According to the CBI, the second preliminary enquiry, which has been instituted on the recommendation of Lieutenant-Governor, is related to the alleged irregularities in the appointment of Delhi Health Minister Satyendra Jain’s daughter Soumya as an adviser for the Mohalla Clinic project under the Health Department. “The enquiry is against Ms. Jain and Health Department Mission Director Tarun Seem,” said the official. Before he demitted office last December, then Lieutenant-Governor Najeeb Jung had forwarded seven complaints of alleged irregularities in the Kejriwal government to the CBI for further investigations. The agency has so far registered two cases, one against AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan for alleged irregularities in the appointments in Delhi Waqf Board. The second case pertains to the appointment of Nikunj Aggarwal as a senior resident doctor with Chacha Nehru Bal Chikitsalaya, and then as the Officer on Special Duty with the Health Minister Satyendra Jain.

﻿ Tours shaken up by trips sharing economy - TTG Asia - Leader in Hotel, Airlines, Tourism and Travel Trade News   Sunday . January 29 . 2017 | HOME | ABOUT US | TTG TRAVEL AWARDS | MEDIA KITS | SUBSCRIBE           Daily News Archives Adam Tan Trade Calendar Blogs TTG Publications TTG ASIA this week TTG Asia ASEAN 50th Anniversary Special Supplement TTG Asia Luxury   Home > Daily News Archives Share | Tours shaken up by trips sharing economy Raini Hamdi, reporting from ATF 2017, Singapore, January 19, 2017   Asian tour operators are reinventing tours and strengthening capabilities as bigger players like Airbnb foray into their territory.   Airbnb claimed 500 experiences in 12 cities worldwide at launch last mid-November and, although only Japan is among the dozen, tour operators recognise it’s just a matter of time before more Asian experiences will be offered and big players like Google enter the travel business.   Masson: take a lot for new players to disrupt tour operations   Currently, the trip-sharing economy, which has birthed local players such as Vietnam’s Triip.me, Singapore’s KKday and Thailand’s Local Alike, has yet to disrupt tour operators’ business. But Niels Steeman, Asian Trails e-commerce and marketing manager, expects it to “create a rumble”, just as vacation rentals has disrupted the hotel sector.   “Looking at the roll-out plans of Airbnb Trips, the focus is more on Europe, the US and South America, but Asia will soon be on their radar,” he said.   And just as in home sharing, there will be such issues as licensing and safety standards. Added Steeman: “What worries us is, as soon as you operate tours, hosts become tour operators and in many countries (where Asian Trails Group operates), you need to have an appropriate licence to be a guide or a tour operator.   “Another big issue is the insurance coverage of the organisers, should anything happen. At Asian Trails, we offer immersive local trips that are off-the-beaten track, but with the security of operating fully licensed and fully insured operations.”   Matt Masson, managing director of Buffalo Tours Singapore, believes it would take a lot for new players to disrupt tour operations. “There’s a lot of attention in the tours and activities space. That’s the strong ground of tour operators and DMCs.   “But I think, specifically with Airbnb, it’s a big challenge from letting out a spare room to actually committing to giving a half- or full-day, some even two or three days. A lot of training needs to go into that to deliver the kind of experience DMCs deliver. I know the amount of effort we put in – guide training, driver training and audits to make sure all our experiences are safe. There’s a lot of intelligence behind and it will take other players time to build up that knowledge,” said Masson.   In the last three to four years, Buffalo Tours has reinvented the meaning of a tour guide – from just someone who stands on the bus and gives historical facts to “real-life” people, be it a restaurant owner or a curator of an art gallery who takes clients behind the scenes.   It launched the Local Life range of tours in 2014, featuring tours that connect clients with local communities and a low environmental footprint. A lot of these tours are done on foot, bicycle or other forms of public transport. It also launched the Essence range, which offers more private touring in 2015, and Masterclass last year, designed to give customers even more experiential moments.   Being on the ground, knowing the hidden places, and having local contacts, “is where DMCs can control that experience better than an OTA,” said Masson.   Steeman foresees that in the near future, Airbnb too will recognise this, become more “lenient” and add DMCs to their platform.   Asian Trails has also reinvented tours by developing the Explore Asia programmes to deliver out-of-the-ordinary tours for couples, families and those seeking new roads in existing destinations. “The market demand (not Airbnb) constantly pushes us to deliver something new,” he said.   As to why a customer would still want to book a tour through a retail agency who gets the tour from the tour operator, when he can now book direct on the trip-sharing economy, Steeman said: “The online B2C/C2C travel segment remains a very fragmented segment. Customers need to go to various sites to get a total package, spending a lot of time and effort searching for the right deal.”   Masson also pointed out other reasons: “Security is one. You are buying from a trusted party who has met local regulations. That sounds old-fashioned but there will be cases in the next few years of online companies delivering a sub-standard service and not meeting expectations. That security of going to a trusted player still remains regardless of the generation.   “And most tour operators will evolve. They have been in the business for years and kept up with the trends,” Masson concluded. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.   Most Popular >   Most Commented > 1.

Do you have more aptitude as a director who organizes people or as a spark plug who inspires people? Would you rather be a chief executive officer or a chief imagination officer? Questions like these will be fertile for you to meditate on in the coming weeks. The astrological omens suggest it's time to explore and activate more of your potential as a leader or catalyst. TAURUS (April 20–May 20): An eccentric Frenchman named Laurent Aigon grew up near an airport and always daydreamed of becoming a commercial pilot. Sadly, he didn't do well enough in school to fulfill his wish. Yet he was smart and ambitious enough to accomplish the next best thing: assembling a realistic version of a Boeing 737 cockpit in his home. With the help of Google, he gathered the information he needed, and he ordered most of the necessary parts over the internet. The resulting masterpiece has enabled him to replicate the experience of being a pilot. It's such a convincing copy that he has been sought as a consultant by organizations that specialize in aircraft maintenance. I suggest you attempt a comparable feat, Taurus: creating a simulated version of what you want. I bet it will eventually lead you to the real thing. GEMINI (May 21–June 20): The weather may be inclement where you live, so you may be resistant to my counsel. But I must tell you the meanings of the planetary omens as I understand them and not fret about whether you'll act on them. Here's my prescription, lifted from Henry David Thoreau's Walden: "We need the tonic of wildness, to wade sometimes in marshes where the bittern and the meadow-hen lurk, and hear the booming of the snipe; to smell the whispering sedge where only some wilder and more solitary fowl builds her nest, and the mink crawls with its belly close to the ground." And why does Thoreau say we need such experiences? "We must be refreshed by the sight of inexhaustible vigor, to witness our own limits transgressed." CANCER (June 21–July 22): Welcome to the most deliciously enigmatic, sensually mysterious phase of your astrological cycle. To provide you with the proper non-rational guidance, I have stolen scraps of dusky advice from the poet Dansk Javlarna (danskjavlarna.tumblr.com). Please read between the lines: (1) Navigate the ocean that roars within the seashell. (2) Carry the key, even if the lock has been temporarily lost. (3) Search through the deepest shadows for the bright light that cast them. (4) Delve into the unfathomable in wordless awe of the inexplicable. LEO (July 23–Aug 22): What exactly would a bolt of lightning taste like? I mean, if you could somehow manage to roll it around in your mouth without having to endure the white-hot shock. There's a booze manufacturer that claims to provide this sensation. The company known as Oddka has created Electricity Vodka, a hard liquor with an extra fizzy jolt. But if any sign of the zodiac could safely approximate eating a streak of lightning without the help of Electricity Vodka, it would be you Leos. These days, you have a special talent for absorbing and enjoying and integrating fiery inspiration. VIRGO (Aug 23–Sept 22): Eighteenth-century painter Joshua Reynolds said that a "disposition to abstractions, to generalizing and classification, is the great glory of the human mind." To that lofty sentiment, his fellow artist William Blake responded, "To generalize is to be an idiot; to particularize is the alone distinction of merit." So I may be an idiot when I make the following generalization, but I think I'm right: In the coming weeks, it will be in your best interests to rely on crafty generalizations to guide your decisions. Getting bogged down in details at the expense of the big picture—missing the forest for the trees—is a potential pitfall that you can and should avoid. LIBRA (Sept 23–Oct 22): Czech writer Bohumil Hrabal penned the novel Dancing Lessons for the Advanced in Age. It consists of one sentence. But it's a long, rambling sentence—117 pages' worth. It streams from the mouth of the narrator, who is an older man bent on telling all the big stories of his life. If there were ever to come a time when you, too, would have cosmic permission and a poetic license to deliver a one-sentence, 117-page soliloquy, Libra, it would be in the coming weeks. Reveal your truths! Break through your inhibitions! Celebrate your epic tales! (P.S.: Show this horoscope to the people you'd like as your listeners.) SCORPIO (Oct 23–Nov 21): When Pluto was discovered in 1930, astronomers called it the ninth planet. But 76 years later, they changed their mind. In accordance with shifting definitions, they demoted Pluto to the status of a mere "dwarf planet." But in recent years, two renowned astronomers at Caltech have found convincing evidence for a new ninth planet. Konstantin Batygin and Michael E. Brown are tracking an object that is much larger than Earth. Its orbit is so far beyond Neptune's that it takes 15,000 years to circle the sun. As yet it doesn't have an official name, but Batygin and Brown informally refer to it as "Phattie." I bring this to your attention, Scorpio, because I suspect that you, too, are on the verge of locating a monumental new addition to your universe. SAGITTARIUS (Nov 22–Dec 21): The tomato and potato are both nightshades, a family of flowering plants. Taking advantage of this commonality, botanists have used the technique of grafting to produce a pomato plant. Its roots yield potatoes, while its vines grow cherry tomatoes. Now would be a good time for you to experiment with a metaphorically similar creation, Sagittarius. Can you think of how you might generate two useful influences from a single source? CAPRICORN (Dec 22–Jan 19): Some guy I don't know keeps sending me e-mails about great job opportunities he thinks I'd like to apply for: a technical writer for a solar energy company, for example, and a social media intern for a business that offers travel programs. His messages are not spam. The gigs are legitimate. And yet I'm not in the least interested. I already have several jobs I enjoy, like writing these horoscopes. I suspect that you, too, may receive worthy but ultimately irrelevant invitations in the coming days, Capricorn. My advice: If you remain faithful to your true needs and desires, more apropos offers will eventually flow your way. AQUARIUS (Jan 20–Feb 18): The word "naysayer" describes a person who's addicted to expressing negativity. A "yeasayer," on the other hand, is a person who is prone to expressing optimism. According to my assessment of the astrological omens, you can and should be a creative yeasayer in the coming days—both for the sake of your own well-being and that of everyone whose life you touch. For inspiration, study Upton Sinclair's passage about Beethoven: He was "the defier of fate, the great yea-sayer." His music is "like the wind running over a meadow of flowers, superlative happiness infinitely multiplied." PISCES (Feb 19–March 20): If I'm feeling prosaic, I might refer to a group of flamingos as a flock. But one of the more colorful and equally correct terms is a "flamboyance" of flamingos. Similarly, a bunch of pretty insects with clubbed antennae and big fluttery wings may be called a kaleidoscope of butterflies. The collective noun for zebras can be a dazzle, for pheasants a bouquet, for larks an exaltation, and for finches a charm. In accordance with current astrological omens, I'm borrowing these nouns to describe members of your tribe. A flamboyance or kaleidoscope of Pisceans? Yes! A dazzle or bouquet or exaltation or charm of Pisceans? Yes! All of the above. Homework: What part of yourself are you scared of? Is it time to give that part a peace offering?

A Trump stock refers to the probability that a company could benefit or be punished dramatically from the President-elect's agenda. Typically the assessment is done under the microscope of Trump's business tripod of lower corporate taxes, repatriation of foreign capital and deregulation. One stock that has rallied immensely since Nov. 8 is Whirlpool, the maker of big appliances such as washing machines, dryers, dishwashers and ovens. The stock was on a real roller coaster in 2016, and took off since Election Day, up 20 percent. "The pros outweigh the cons here, meaning, Whirlpool is more of a Trump stock than a non-Trump stock," the "Mad Money" host said. If Trump can pass his pro-growth agenda and the U.S. economy accelerates, than interest rates will keep rising and the dollar will go even higher. This was a worry for Cramer, as Whirlpool could take an even bigger currency hit on international sales. Ethan Miller | Getty Images Whirlpool's Scan-to-Cook technology One formerly-despised group didn't need Trump to rebound, as it started to rally even before his surprise victory. And it has only become stronger since then. The agriculture business has come roaring back, including FMC, which has rallied more than 75 percent since lows last February. FMC is mostly a chemical company that caters to the agriculture market, and also produces lithium, with a health and fitness aspect. However, 70 percent of sales are from agriculture chemicals. "FMC is still cheap here and it is worth buying into any weakness as we head into their next earnings report in less than three weeks," Cramer said. One of the most powerful read-throughs for Cramer was in technology after Netflix reported a strong quarter on Wednesday night, adding a record 94 million customers. The news sent the stock up 8 percent in after-hours trading. And when Netflix goes higher, Cramer expects FANG to get a lift, too. FANG is his acronym that stands for Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google, now Alphabet. "It is a fact of life in earnings season—Trump or not," Cramer said.

Software analytics play Splunk has an operational intelligence platform designed to make machine data more accessible and useful for clients. Cramer referred to it as the "Google of data mining." Unfortunately, the stock hasn't moved much lately because even though it reported a robust quarter, Splunk is the kind of growth technology stock that investors gravitate to when the economy is anemic. So, when investors think the economy is accelerating, money managers turn their attention to cyclical stocks instead. Cramer spoke with Splunk's CEO Doug Merritt, who explained why the product is uniquely differentiated in the industry. "You've got this massive data coming in that is not structured in any way. Trying to ask it questions and have it format itself so that you can answer random questions is a very difficult piece, and that's why our customers … are all fanatical," Merritt said. The question of whether an investor is nimble enough to get back in quickly after selling a stock is one that has plagued Cramer his entire life. Even selling Bank of America at $23 a share with the intention of getting back in at $20 or $21 is risky. And for a hedge fund manager, they better be good. That is what investors pay them for. Good trading means knowing when a stock has gone up too much and to leave it alone. And when it goes back down, buy the stock back at lower prices on the bet that estimates will need to come up if the Federal Reserve plans to raise rates, Cramer said. "Bank of America's shareholder base is not monolithic," Cramer said. "You will always have investors, people who believe in fundamentals and listening to the conference call and figuring out what to pay for the stock based on how much the company could earn." In the Lightning Round, Cramer gave his take on a few stocks from callers: Harley-Davidson: "I don't know how the quarter is going. I think the brand is terrific, it has great brand equity. I do feel that you can own it for the long term, but the short term it has been a rocky performer." BB&T: "I think that this one is going to come down a little bit because the group is for sale. And when the group is for sale it tends to trade all together. Wait a point or two, and then you can pull the trigger because I really like BB&T."

Big new Seattle office lease signals major expansion for Snapchat engineering center by Nat Levy on January 18, 2017 at 10:00 amJanuary 18, 2017 at 10:09 am Comments  3 Share  428 Tweet Share  479 Reddit Email Read GeekWire's weekly sports newsletter! (GeekWire Photo Illustration / Jacob Demmitt) Snap Inc., the company behind the hit Snapchat app, is poised to significantly grow the footprint of its Seattle engineering office, GeekWire has learned. Multiple sources with knowledge of the building and the deal told GeekWire that Snap will move into three floors of Market Place Tower later this year, space Redfin is vacating as it moves to the new Hill7 office building in Seattle. Snap could move in as soon as late spring, sources said. The deal amounts to nearly 50,000 square feet, a big increase from the company’s existing Seattle space. A year ago we reported that Snap had leased about 8,000 square feet at 101 Stewart St., the First & Stewart Building, across the street from the Pike Place Market. Snap didn’t stray far in its latest deal, as the Market Place Tower at 2025 First Ave. is just a couple blocks away from First & Stewart and less than a block from Pike Place Market. Snap declined to comment, as did Dan Dahl and David Gurry of Colliers International’s Seattle office, the landlord representatives for Market Place Tower. Snap has a history of going somewhat against the grain in terms of its office choices, picking iconic locations not necessarily known for being tech hubs. Its headquarters is not Silicon Valley, but rather in the beachfront neighborhood of Venice in Los Angeles. In Seattle, out-of-town tech giants like Google and Facebook have opted for big offices in the tech-heavy South Lake Union neighborhood, while Snap has stayed close to Pike Place Market, one of the city’s top tourist attractions. Snap is one of more than 80 companies from around the world that have set up shop in Seattle to gain access to the region’s deep pool of tech talent. Many of the biggest companies in the world have opened engineering centers here and then grown to become important parts of the local tech ecosystem. RELATED CONTENTCheck out GeekWire's list of Seattle-Area Engineering Centers established by out-of-town companies. First & Stewart is the same building where Facebook got its start in the city in 2010, and Snap appears to be following the social media giant’s playbook. Facebook eventually grew out of that space and took several floors at the Metropolitan Park towers before making its big statement and leasing the Frank Gehry-designed Dexter Station project in Seattle’s South Lake Union neighborhood with room for more than 2,000 people. It has since planted an even bigger flag here, leasing a pair of planned office buildings and another that was recently completed. Snap has been coy about its presence in Seattle, going back to 2015 when it dropped the first hints of plans here by putting up a billboard on state Route 99 in Seattle. GeekWire was previously able to confirm the temporary location using a picture posted to Snapchat by an employee. After dropping the “chat” from its corporate name, expanding into camera hardware with Snap Spectacles, and repositioning itself as a next-generation camera company, Snap is set for a big year with a possible IPO as soon as March. Snap has not said what type of work is taking place in the Seattle engineering office, but job listings indicate that the office is focused on software development. A current job listing for a software engineering role at Snap’s Seattle office says, “Working from our Seattle, WA office, you will be tasked with solving interesting technical challenges, such as architecting and deploying infrastructure to handle our scale, designing a slick and secure mobile client, and maintaining software used by millions every day.” Some believe that going public could be a big test for the notoriously-secretive company, as it will be forced to reveal more about itself to get investors to buy stock. But secrecy has proved successful for Snap in the past. When it released the $130 video-recording Spectacles with no warning, and didn’t give any out for reviews, the company started a frenzy, with people lining up to buy them from “Snapbot” vending machines and battling to get a pair on the resale market.

Sayan Chakraborty Photo: Bloomberg Bengaluru: For Indian Internet start-ups, last year turned 2015 on its head. Valuation markdowns, executive departures, job cuts, market share losses (to American rivals) and a lack of big-ticket fund raises dominated headlines last year. Flipkart Internet Pvt. Ltd bounced back in its market share battle with Amazon India with good sales in the festive season of October-November, even as the company grappled with management issues and successive markdowns in its valuation. ALSO READ | Has Amazon overestimated the size of India’s e-commerce market? Finally, Flipkart’s largest investor, Tiger Global Management, took control of operations at the company this month. Kalyan Krishnamurthy, who re-joined Flipkart in June, was named CEO of Flipkart, replacing Binny Bansal, who became group CEO. The change came after the board reportedly lost confidence in the Bansals’ ability to run the company. In 2016, Flipkart was locked in a survival struggle with Amazon, which upped the ante by announcing an infusion of an additional $3 billion in India, a market it cannot afford to lose especially after bowing to Alibaba in China. Snapdeal, backed by SoftBank and Alibaba, is now considered to be out of the race after failing to secure the large amounts of fresh capital it needed to stay in contention. Flipkart started 2016 on a shaky note, as the company anointed co-founder and erstwhile chief operating officer Binny Bansal as CEO. Sachin Bansal was made the executive chairman; industry executives say it was a consequence of Flipkart ceding ground to Amazon and its failure to scale up the advertisement business and the app-only debacle, believed to be Sachin Bansal’s brainchild. Among others, Flipkart’s much vaunted customer service level also took a hit, denting its customer base to Amazon’s advantage. Click here for enlarge Not only this, senior executive Mukesh Bansal, who took up key roles in Flipkart after selling off Myntra to Flipkart, Ankit Nagori and Punit Soni, Flipkart’s celebrated hire from Google, also quit the company. All along, Amazon was nipping at the heels of Flipkart, outspending the latter in marketing, offers and discounts. Flipkart was also hit by a series of markdown in valuations by mutual fund investors such as Morgan Stanley, Valic, Fidelity and T Rowe Price. The lowest valuation assigned to it was $5.54 billion by Morgan Stanley in November. Though Flipkart brushed aside the impact of markdowns, industry experts believe it could adversely impact Flipkart’s fundraising efforts. While Amazon was pushing the pedal hard, the entire e-commerce ecosystem was dealt a body blow by a government regulation on foreign direct investment. In March last year, the government allowed 100% FDI in online retail of goods and services under the so-called marketplace model through the automatic route. ALSO READ | Flipkart, Tiger Global’s unlikely burden At least three conditions attached to the government’s approval, however, could either hurt e-commerce companies or force them to find new ways to get around them: first, no group company or seller on a marketplace can contribute more than 25% of the sales generated; second, marketplaces cannot influence product prices and third, small sellers will now have to take responsibility of the quality of goods and after sales support. As the e-tailers had to put sale events on hold and go back to the drawing board to restructure their business structures, sales slowed. Mint reported on 14 April that Flipkart’s sales hadn’t grown month-on-month since November 2015, and Snapdeal’s monthly revenue declined, though the companies denied the development. All said, Flipkart seemed to have got its act together during the festive sales in the October-November period, traditionally considered the best in terms of sales for e-tailers. Flipkart outsold Amazon India during the first sale event of the all-important festive season, recording unit sales of 15.5 million compared with 15 million units for the US-based online retailing giant. Flipkart generated gross sales of at least Rs3,000 crore from its five-day flagship sale Big Billion Days, Mint reported on 8 October. Amazon said it received orders for 15 million units during Great Indian Festival, its Big Billion Day rival sale event. Amazon said then that its single highest-selling product was the Prime subscription, and groceries were among its other big sellers. Snapdeal, on the other hand, claimed to have sold more than 10 million units during its Unbox Diwali sales. ALSO READ | Flipkart remains most popular e-commerce brand in India: RedSeer report According to RedSeer Management Consulting, cumulative gross sales by e-tailers in October stood at $2.2 billion, the highest ever in the history of e-commerce in India. But the revival hit another roadblock: demonetization of high value currency notes on 8 November. According to RedSeer, number of transactions fell about 15-20% in the three weeks after demonetization, as against the first week of November, in a market where cash on delivery is the preferred payment option. On the whole, the e-commerce market saw little or no growth—a most worrying development that shocked online retailers, investors and analysts alike. They can only hope for an improvement in 2017.

Look at the futuristic EPCOT Disney theme park in Florida and US navy’s new Perdix swarm drones to see what the future holds PUBLISHED : Thursday, 19 January, 2017, 1:08pm UPDATED : Thursday, 19 January, 2017, 10:43pm Comments:   Richard Harris Share PrintEmail Related topics The View Related Articles Business HK needs to join the world of the truly modern entrepreneur 19 Jan 2017 Business Spotlight shining ever brighter on executive pay 18 Jan 2017 Global Economy Tech jobs to become key battleground for Trump and Xi 13 Jan 2017 “Power is not a means; it is an end.” This guiding principle drove the superstate in George Orwell’s iconic novel, 1984. Power was held exclusively by an inner elite who persecuted individualism as a thought crime. Never in history have we lived in a world where personal freedom is so prevalent. Yes, benevolent and malevolent governments still restrict individual behaviour, but much of humankind lives today in an historically liberal time that takes pride in equality of opportunity, fairness, and justice. But for how long? The futuristic EPCOT Disney theme park in Florida is educational with technology as its theme. When it opened 34 years ago, the interconnectivity of today’s world, where packages are delivered by drone (some lethal), could never have been imagined. Before you arrive at EPCOT, you receive a wristband, called a MagicBand, which embeds a chip that “effortlessly” unlocks your hotel room, allows you to enter the right park, ride the attractions, and to pays for food and souvenirs. The chip traces back to your mobile number and fingerprints. Disney knows when you enter the park, where you are, what you bought – and how to get hold of you once they have inferred your habits. Combine this with the video release of the US Navy’s new tiny Perdix swarm drones, which is really worth watching. Each shares a distributed brain that collaborates with every other Perdix. They have no central leader but flock, swarm, and attack autonomously like a flock of birds, making it almost impossible for an enemy to defend against them. A social credit rating could be used to reward good citizenship by providing opportunities in education and employment. If the algorithms rate you badly, borrowing and renting might become ‘difficult’ This artificial intelligence can be combined with Big Data that can identify... just you. There has been a growing clamour from “academics” in China to develop a reliable creditworthiness system. As well as credit card and mortgage information, traffic violations, academic qualifications, convictions, taxes, family status, even computer time can be combined into a single “social credit” rating. Many private financial companies in China are already combining Big Data and artificial intelligence to judge creditworthiness. One dating website encourages users to boast about their rating as a hook to catch prospects. A social credit rating could be used to reward good citizenship by providing opportunities in education and employment. If the algorithms rate you badly, borrowing and renting might become “difficult”. China’s State Council believes that social credit will “forge public opinion that trust-keeping is glorious”. The “system will reward those who report acts of breach of trust”. Could the algorithms also be programmed to identify you as a dissident, a whistleblower, or the rather stupid second son of a princeling? Of course, trivial reasons to sacrifice your privacy are no different to Google’s request to know your location in order to find a great restaurant – and if half a billion customers of an unaware Yahoo can have their emails hacked, no data is safe. In technological terms, we are well along the path to the 1984 dystopia. The rise of euphemistic fake news (epitomised by Donald Trump’s tweets), precisely echoes Orwell’s warning that “he who controls the past controls the future, he who controls the present controls the past”. Orwell’s superstate was controlled by the Ministry of Peace, which waged perpetual war; the Ministry of Plenty, which created poverty to keep the people in place; the Ministry of Truth who controlled propaganda and “rectified” history to reinforce the Party’s truths; and the Ministry of Love that organised torture. Your mobile number is already a global ID card. It is the chip in the MagicBand; the mark of the beast. You can be traced to it from your travel records, your tax identification number, or your car registration. In the 1984 superstate, Big Brother could watch you through television screens in each room, and even today you can’t have a private conversation. Your phone can be hacked and the microphone switched on. Wait for the day when it becomes illegal to change your SIM card, in the interests of national security. It is impossible to turn the clock back. Inevitably, those collecting Big Data find it too tempting not to exploit it for their own interests. Businesses and governments have pledged to offer better protection of personal information and to allow correction of mistaken records – but privacy is meaningless without enforcement.

Whether in Germany, Korea, India, China, the US or Japan, a lack of trust was the number-one answer when consumers were asked about whether they’d consider a self-driving car. In South Korea, 81% of respondents said that they had safety concerns, followed by Japanese (79%) and German consumers (72%). Even in the US where real-world testing of autonomous cars is a reality in a number of states, 74% feel that self-driving cars won’t be safe. However, 68% of Americans said they’d change their opinion once such cars have proven they’re safe, and 54% said they’d travel in an autonomous car if it had been built by a brand they trust. “Automakers and technology companies first have to earn consumers’ trust, then turn that trust into a willingness to pay for a must-have feature,” said Craig Giffi, vice chairman and US automotive industry leader, Deloitte LLP, and co-author of the report. “Today trust is lacking. Ironically, fully autonomous vehicles are being engineered to be much safer than today’s vehicles.” And it could prove especially challenging for the US automotive industry to gain this trust. Deloitte found just 47% of US consumers trust carmakers to deliver an autonomous car (compared with 51% in Germany and 76% of Japanese respondents) but it’s worse still for tech companies. Google may have taken an early lead in the race to develop a truly self-driving car, or at least the technology underpinning them, but only 20% of Americans said that they would trust a car from an established Silicon Valley company. The report comes as a number of carmakers, from Honda and Toyota to Volvo, have reiterated that despite the rapid pace of technological development, they haven’t lost sight of the fact cars are first and foremost built for people. “The important question isn’t whether future vehicles will be equipped with automated or connected technologies,” said Bob Carter, senior vice president of automotive operations for Toyota during his CES presentation. “It is the experience of the people who engage with those vehicles.” AFP Tags: Confusion, consumers, Craig Giffi, Deloitte, Ford, Google, self-driving, self-driving technology, study, Tesla Also read Automakers team up with automotive parts suppliers to make self-driving cars, share costs Google showcases new self-driving Chrysler Pacifica X Recommended For You Tesla is suing ex-Autopilot head Sterling Anderson for trying to poach Tesla engineers Amit Singhal, former Google search chief joins Uber as Senior Vice President of engineering Panasonic plans to extend Tesla partnership beyond batteries Automakers team up with automotive parts suppliers to make self-driving cars, share costs Subscribe to our newsletter GO You are Now Subscribed to our Newsletter - Stay Tuned !

By Gene Quinn January 18, 2017 19 Print Article ALERT: The article below is from Wednesday, January 18, 2017. As of 5:20pm ET on Wednesday, January 25, 2017, no official announcement on the future of Michelle Lee has been made by the USPTO. For the latest CLICK HERE. USPTO Director Michelle Lee. Those who believe Friday, January 20, 2017 will be the last day for USPTO Director Michelle Lee may need to rethink things and start to consider the possibility that she will be the Director for the foreseeable future. Earlier today Professor Dennis Crouch wrote on PatentlyO that the political appointees at the USPTO would all resign sometime before noon on Inauguration Day, January 20, 2017. In any other transition year that would be exactly what would happen, but this is not your average transition and there may be quite a bit of drama unfolding behind closed doors at the Patent Office. Chief Communications Officer Patrick Ross has already resigned, sending out an e-mail to colleagues and associates, letting them know that Thursday, January 19, 2017 will be his last day. So too has Chief of Staff Vikrum Aiyer. This is what typically happens at the end of a President’s term. Political appointees are asked for their resignation, and the resignations are generally accepted. In some situations, the incoming, newly elected President will keep certain officials on for a period of time until replacements are put in place. But the Trump Transition Team has notified politically appointed U.S. Ambassadors (in contrast to career foreign service officials serving in global hot spots) that they will not be allowed to stay at their posts. If President Trump will not allow U.S. Ambassadors to stay on, which is a courtesy frequently extended, the thinking goes that it does not bode well for any other Obama appointee. Or so we thought. Early today I learned from a credible source that Lee was either refusing to resign or perhaps attempting to revoke her letter of resignation. Shortly thereafter I was told that senior Obama officials were upset with what was happening at the Patent Office and that Lee had “gone rogue.” I reached out to the Patent Office for comment, suggesting I was happy to accept even a denial of this rather bizarre and difficult to believe story. The Patent Office has not made anyone available to confirm, deny, rebut or refute this version of events. Throughout the day I attempted to find additional information that would confirm, deny, rebut or refute that Lee was affirmatively refusing to resign as Director. Then late today, after the close of business, a group that is allegedly made up of USPTO employees sent an anonymous e-mail from a Gmail address to me and a group of other Washington insiders. The e-mail explains grievances with Director Lee and why this particular group of anonymous USPTO employees does not believe she should be allowed to stay on as Director. What caught my attention, however, was the preface to the list of grievances, which stated: “According to internal documents circulating at the USPTO, Michelle Lee is being asked and vetted to stay on during the Trump Administration.” What are these internal documents? Efforts transitioned to seek additional confirmation of the initial information and to attempt to identify what those “internal documents” may have said, if in fact they do exist. A second credible source confirmed for me that Michelle Lee was attempting to stay on as Director. This confirmation came from an independent channel of information separate from the initial lead given to me earlier in the day. I was told that PTO Officials were refusing to confirm or deny any rumors relative to Lee, both on and off the record. Meanwhile, I’ve learned that the examining corps has been sent a memo from Lee indicating that she is planning on leaving, but that she would stay if asked to stay. This is consistent with what she told Politico in November, and what she has been known to tell others in Washington, DC. But if that is all that is happening it is hard to understand why the Patent Office was unavailable for a comment of any kind, and even harder to understand why USPTO career officials have been refusing to confirm or deny any rumors relative to Lee one way or another. Complicating matters, earlier today Commerce Secretary Nominee Wilbur Ross explained during his Senate confirmation hearing that he met Lee yesterday to discuss her handling of issues relating to her former employer Google. Ross explained that he intends to continue using Lee’s ethics policy with regard to Trump, who has pending trademark matters before the Office. In light of the day’s events some are starting to speculate that this meeting between Ross and Lee was more than just an exit interview, and may in fact be a job interview. The situation is fluid. What we know is that Michelle Lee does not want to step down as Director of the Patent and Trademark Office. She has repeatedly let it be known that she is interested in staying. Whether she refused to resign or revoked her resignation remains unproven at this hour, but the unusually tight-lipped nature of Patent Office and senior Officials raises suspicions. If she has refused to resign or has revoked her letter of resignation and she is not being vetted by the Trump Administration it would seem we are headed for an awkward and potentially embarrassing showdown. As one source put it, “we will know on Friday. She will either be there or she won’t.” But for those who have written Michelle Lee off altogether, the news of her demise may be greatly exaggerated.

They just have too much power, via controlling search. We may just be witnessing the transformation of the United States into a country completely controlled by Google. I’m moving to China. angry dude January 18, 2017 10:40 pm If she refuses to resign someone must tell her: “you are fired !!!” (TM D.Trump) Charles Barton January 19, 2017 12:32 am IPdude@1 January 18, 2017 10:03 pm I’m baffled by Google’s apparent domination. Google’s search algorithms are not so impressive. To tell the truth, I preferred DEC’s Altavista search engine, and Google’s patents like the tauted Panda patent are almost certainly invalid under 35 U.S.C. § 101. I wish DEC top management had understood what it had, but DEC never succeeded in making money on Unix even though it had some of the best platforms. We are probably fortunate that the incompetence and stupidity of hi-tech management teams seems eventually to correct excessive market (and hence political) dominance of any hi-tech corporation. Inventor January 19, 2017 2:27 am I like Donald J. Trump Jr. for director. If the due process issues involving (mis) use of prior art by the PTAB are not corrected, in less than 20 years they can change the name to Trademark Office….there won’t be any valid US patents left. Inventor January 19, 2017 7:34 am Charles Barton, Good point. I too am baffled. Google started out with an anti-patent slant. No pun intended. At the time they were working on Backrub, Robin (Yanhong) Li had developed an algorithm for IDD a Dow Jones subsidiary that likely “influenced” the Google Boys at Stanford. http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2009/1005/technology-baidu-robin-li-man-whos-beating-google.html “…. In 1996 he [Li] created a site-scoring algorithm for Dow Jones called RankDex and an associated patent. Around that time two Stanford students named Larry Page and Sergey Brin were experimenting with a similar algorithm they called BackRub and, later, Google. …” Backrub later became PageRank. Li patented his ideas in the US but moved back to China to start Bidu. Beside PageRank, Google’s other claim to fame is the use of text found in the hyperlinks connecting to a site. Li was there first as well with a patent: Hypertext document retrieval system and method US 5920859 A http://www.google.com/patents/US5920859?dq=yanhong+li#v=onepage&q=yanhong%20li&f=false No wonder the Google Boys were from the get go loose with IP ownership. No wonder then that their head of IP is anti-patent and no wonder that we have the mess we now have with Michele Lee’s setup of the PTAB. The Google Boys also never seem to have given due credit to Albert-László Barabási’s (see his book titled “Linked”), who preceded their work, sometimes presenting at the same conferences. Go figure. IP theft or just very “efficient infringement”? Night Writer January 19, 2017 8:11 am @3 Charles Barton: I think part of it is market power from having such a large share of the keyword market. It makes it hard for start-ups. Also, I think part of it is the massive infrastructure they have to support the search. If you try to use Bing, you see the results are usually inferior. But, —and this is something the Google founders said in an interview in 2008 in a documentary–that they are terrified that a start-up will come along with a better way to do search and they will almost instantly loose all their revenue. Google makes something like 80-90 of their revenue from the search and clearly have market power. Anyway, anyone can see why they would not want patents. They want to be able to take anything that is created and incorporate it into their platform, which is a lot like Microsoft was or maybe is with Windows. Paul Cole January 19, 2017 8:12 am As I understand it under the “spoils system” which prevails in the US she should routinely offer her resignation. I think it dates back to the Jackson Democrats victory in 1828. Valuationguy January 19, 2017 8:22 am To understand Google’s power you also need to understand the power it has over information in today’s age. A small tweak of its search engine….and whole swathes of the Internet effectively ‘disappear’ from public perusal since they are much harder to find. (The recent election is exhibit #1 of how Google can….and DOES…exercise its will on the public…though it is usually less obvious about it.) Additionally…the categorizing of internet content for ‘search’ means that Google’s spiders are picking up on and can correlate information on ANYONE they run across in the Web. It is a mini private-NSA all by itself. Mark Syman January 19, 2017 8:27 am What a depressing thought that Google will maintain it’s strangehold on the patent system through Michelle Lee. Curious January 19, 2017 8:57 am This is truly concerning. Is Trump’s plan to “Make America Great Again”? or is it “Make the Wealthy more Wealthier?” Leaving Michelle Lee as the Director of the USPTO is a signal that the failed Patent policies of the past are going to be continued. We may just be witnessing the transformation of the United States into a country completely controlled by Google. I’m moving to China. Zuckerberg is learning Mandarin. Maybe he knows something that we don’t. Fat Bastard January 19, 2017 9:34 am Don’t be evil. Night Writer January 19, 2017 9:53 am To my mind, the person should be able to read a file wrapper and determine the quality of the examination. Consider that I will bet that Lee cannot even evaluate the quality of a patent. That she cannot read a file wrapper. So, she is running an organization where she cannot even tell if the work product is any good. Get someone in there that did prosecution for 10+ years. Patent observer January 19, 2017 10:35 am @Night Writer – leading the PTO has absolutely nothing to do with examination. A director needs to manage 10,000 moving parts, keep them working in sync. You need a big picture focus and political savvy to deal with other government agencies. A patent attorney focused on nuts and bolts would be the absolute worst kind of director. For your issues, you want a patent attorney as commissioner of patents or a deputy commissioner. Not a senate-confirmed head of the agency. Curious January 19, 2017 11:52 am Consider that I will bet that Lee cannot even evaluate the quality of a patent. That she cannot read a file wrapper. Sure she can … “hmmm, could this patent read on anything that Google or Facebook does?” Followed by … “it does … it must not be a quality patent then.” Eric Berend January 19, 2017 11:54 am “I hope we shall take warning from the example and crush in its birth the aristocracy of our moneyed corporations which dare already to challenge our government to a trial of strength, and bid defiance to the laws of our country” – Thomas Jefferson, written in a letter to George Logan, November 12, 1816 and quoted in Volume 12 of the works of Jefferson*[1]. This is the denouement of Founding Father Thomas Jefferson’s now increasingly famous quote. Even Kublai Khan knew it was better to incent collection of money through gambling than to impose taxes on the Chinese, when the Mongols conquered the Song dynasty. By contrast, these clumsy “efficient infringer” rubes smash as much china in the shop as possible, bulling and bullying around. If they knew what was wise for them, they would leave at least a sliver of apparent opportunity to continue the attraction to inventors of the existing process. Then, only the strategically valuable, necessary or useful (to their own industrial lines) patents would be “invalidated” by their captive sycophants in the relevant bureaucratic positions of power. But, they are too crude and inept, for that. Instead, in their raging fear, they have burned up the whole ‘patent-scape’ in a relentless scorched-earth campaign. Only here, the great problem is: this isn’t war; it’s intellectual property contention. There isn’t a natural ecosystem to recover over time; in such an artificial milieu, its arbitrary limitations are absolute. Faced with such an absolute abnegation of our natural interests, in a so-called capitalistic limited-representation democratic republic as the United States of America is purported to be, the vast majority of inventors will refuse to disclose our inventions or emigrate in an attempt to find at least some respect, let alone the entirely justified renumeration we deserve for our applied genius, stubborn persistence, risk-taking courage and perpicacity that few others have, in the human species; and the products of which, enormously benefit the rest of humanity. [1] See the now famous quote in former President Jefferson’s own handwriting, here: http://memory.loc.gov/master/mss/mtj/mtj1/049/0600/0642.jpg Night Writer January 19, 2017 2:14 pm @13 Patent Observer; You know there are people that learned patent prosecution and then went on to other things. Someone like that would be best. And, seriously? Lee probably can’t even read a file wrapper. You think someone can run the agency when they can’t even read a file wrapper? What you describe is a person that will continue to mismanage an agency. Moreover, do you think someone is qualified to run the DOJ who hasn’t been a prosecutor? (And, being a prosecutor is a nuts and bolts job.) Do you think that someone is qualified to run the dep. of treasury if they haven’t worked at bank doing all the nuts and bolt stuff? Sorry, but you are way off. Listen to Lee. She has no clue what the PTO is doing and how to improve it. She can figure out how to weaken patents (her primary job as nominated by Google) as that is relatively easy. LLDC January 19, 2017 3:12 pm “What a depressing thought that Google will maintain it’s strangehold on the patent system through Michelle Lee.” +++++++1 Well, we certainly cannot trust Rep. Goodlatte to help with the selection of a new PTO Director. He is the head of the Judiciary C’mtee and in bed with Google and Facebook. PTO is screwed. Obama’s slimy administration will live forever. Anon January 20, 2017 7:32 am Great post Eric. Eric Berend January 21, 2017 7:15 pm @ 21.. Anon – Thank you very much. I try not to presume too much; but at some point, principle has to matter; or, eventually, the Republic will fall. Founding Father John Adams’ maxim of the U.S.A. being a “…nation of laws not men…” is at peril, when such arbitrary degradation of essential components of the nation’s economic structure as the patent system and the USPTO, are treated with such casual disregard by those entrusted with the Constitutional public interest. I believe you would agree with me in saying that as inventors, we are willing to participate in the bargain offered by the U.S. Constitution: that guarantees only eventual disclosure to the public domain, in exchange for our enjoying the opportunity of a limited-term right of exclusion; which can sometimes foster an industrial ‘head start’ advantage and thereby be considered valuable. Now, it is up to the powers that be to recognize the same, and effect a restoral of at least some reliable establishment supporting the Constitutional bargain. The U.S. Congress could go a long way in this direction by re-recognizing the superiority of the former 200+ years of U.S. patent law jurisprudence, admitting the AIA is a captive-interest failed experiment and repealing it as soon as possible. “We must make our choice. We may have democracy, or we may have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can’t have both.” – Justice Louis Brandeis Post a Comment Respectfully add to the discussion.

It is, after all, the “basic fabric” of life, the “natural choice” of every human being. And yet, it is only an “occasional visitor” in most of our lives. This is because, says world-renowned spiritual master Sadhguru, our bodies and minds are not taking instructions from us. But there’s a way out — and the way out is in. “Essentially, happiness or joy is just a certain state of pleasantness which every human being is seeking within himself or herself. Do not look at joy as some kind of an attainment or an achievement. It is the basic, fundamental fabric of life,” Sadhguru said in an interview. “Joy is the natural choice for every human being. If there was a choice between being pleasant and unpleasant within yourself, I’m sure everyone will choose pleasantness. You don’t need any guru or teaching or scripture to tell you — please choose joy; don’t choose misery. “But still, for most people, joy is only an occasional visitor in their lives. This is simply because their interiority is not happening the way they want it — their bodies and minds are not taking instructions from them. Inner Engineering is about taking charge of this. If your mind is doing what you want it to do, you will definitely make sure you are joyful,” he explained. A yogi and mystic, Sadhguru has been a lead speaker at the UN General Assembly, a regular at the World Economic Forum and a special invitee at the Australian Leadership Retreat, Indian Economic Summit and TED. “Your joy, your misery, your love, your agony, your bliss, lies in your hands. There is a way out. And the way out is in. It is only by turning inward that we can truly create a world of love, light, and laughter,” he contended. His latest book “Inner Engineering” is dubbed a yogi’s guide to joy. “The inner dimension is uncharted terrain; it’s sensible to take directions. A guru is a live roadmap. GPS: Guru Pathfinding System! That’s what a guru is. Is he a must? Not necessarily. If you have to find your own way, you can do it, but it may take forever. What is so simple and within yourself, may take forever because you may go around the world trying to find it,” he said. In the new book, Sadhguru distills his own experiences with spirituality and yoga and introduces the “transformational” concept of Inner Engineering. Developed by him over several years, this powerful practice claims to “align the mind and the body with energies around and within”, creating a world of limitless power and possibilities. So what is the role of a guru in one’s life? “A guru is concerned with life — the mechanism of your life. He does not propound philosophies, but offers methods or technologies. A technology is about learning how to make something work. If it works, it’s contemporary. So a guru is always relevant,” he said. In recent times, however, spirituality and yoga have also become some sort of a fashion as well as an entrepreneurial venture for many. When asked to comment on this aspect, he said: “Something that starts as a fashion can be transformed into life’s passion. It does not matter through which door you enter as long as you find your way to your inner temple. “What may start as a fad can be turned into a dimension-profound; it all depends upon from what source it is being transmitted. If there is purity and power at the source, there is no fear of consequences as what is transmitted is beyond distortion,” he argued. Sadhguru’s grasp of world affairs, as well as his unerringly scientific approach to human well-being have had a transformative influence at establishments such as the World Bank, the House of Lords, the World Presidents’ Organisation, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the London Business School, Google and Microsoft, to name just a few. Elaborating, he said that “there will always be enterprises around whatever becomes reasonably popular. We shouldn’t be distracted or disturbed by these. Are they teaching it properly? There are question marks about it. Some of them are teaching it properly, some are not. These manifestations are a result of the commercial process. But it is only on the surface that these distortions are happening here and there. The core of yoga is not disturbed in any way.” With a celebratory engagement with life on all levels, Sadhguru’s areas of active involvement encompasses fields as diverse as architecture and visual design, poetry and painting, ecology and horticulture, sports and music. On his expectations from the readers of the book, he said that his life has been dedicated to empowering human beings to take charge of their own destinies and bringing them to a state of joyful inclusiveness so that the possibility that we are in does not pass us by as a generation. “This book could be a doorway to that world. Let us make it happen,” he said. — IANS About the author View all articles by Oman Observer ← Holidays can help in improving health The vanishing villages → ← Previous Next → Search Recent Posts Recent Miss Universe beauty pageant kicks off in Manila Actor John Hurt, star of ‘The Elephant Man’, dies Confusion at US airports after Trump’s immigration ban HM condolences to Dubai Ruler Read More ...

Cyanogen was very productive until the company has decided to shutdown CyanogenMod (CM), but even if this place doesn’t exist anymore, the developers will need to find another one that hosts CM builds for the most popular Android devices. After killing CyanogenMod, the team behind it transitioned CM into Lineage OS, which is currently in its early stages, but many smartphones owners already received unofficial Lineage OS 14.1 builds on XDA, as well as in other communities. At the end of December, Nexus 5 Lineage OS 14.1 ROM arrived unofficially and users who wanted to install it were prompted to androidfilehost to download it, but since it was an AOSP based ROM, it was necessary to flash/install a Nougat supported Gapps package in order to get Google’s services. The reason why you should install Lineage OS is that it comes with unique features and the official Lineage OS builds will be reliable. It isn’t known if the Lineage OS 14.1 for will be updated nightly or weekly, but it’s good to know that it will be available for the Nexus 5X and 6P as well. Unfortunately, for now, the Nexus 4 and Nexus 6 can’t be found on the list of supported devices. The Nexus 5 costs now $199 (16GB) and it can be purchased from Amazon. The device was created by LG and released in November 2013, with Android 5.0 Lollipop out of the box, but Google will never release Nougat for it. The Nexus 5 has a 4.95-inch True HD IPS+ Full HD screen, it’s powered by a Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800 quad-core 2.3 GHz Krait 400 processor that’s backed by 2GB of RAM and its internal memory is fixed. The primary camera supports 8MP and it offers features such as autofocus, OIS and LED flash, while the primary camera is very weak, of only 1.3MP. The biggest downside of this phone is the battery, which is non-removable and has a capacity of only 2300 mAh.

US sues Oracle, says it pays white men more than others by: BARBARA ORTUTAY, AP Technology Writer Updated: Jan 18, 2017 - 4:46 PM Twtter NEW YORK (AP) - The U.S. Department of Labor has filed a lawsuit against Oracle, claiming that the technology giant has a "systemic practice" of paying white male workers more than their non-white and female counterparts with the same job titles. The suit also says that the company favors Asian workers in its recruiting and hiring practices for product development and other technical roles, which resulted in hiring discrimination against non-Asian applicants. In a statement, Oracle Corp. on Wednesday called the lawsuit "politically motivated, based on false allegations and wholly without merit." The Labor Department said the lawsuit is the result of a review of Oracle's equal employment opportunity practices at its headquarters in Redwood Shores, California. According the suit, Oracle has refused to comply with the agency's "routine requests" for employment data and records. "As a federal contractor, Oracle is prohibited from engaging in employment discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, sexual orientation or gender identity or national origin and is required to take affirmative action to ensure that equal employment opportunity is provided to applicants and employees in all aspects of employment," the Labor Department said. Earlier this month, the Labor Department also sued Google , saying the company has refused to provide the department with employee compensation records and other information as part of an audit designed to ensure it isn't discriminating against workers based on gender or race. Oracle, Google and other technology companies have made public commitments to improving gender and racial diversity in recent years. But change has been slow to come, and the companies continue to be dominated by white (and sometimes Asian) men, especially in technical and leadership positions. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Okay, sure, this fireworks-filled invite actually spells out next month's date and even the time, but it doesn't exactly say it's for the LG G6. It doesn't have to. Here's what gives it all away: the invite's dimensions are 18:9 tall. That's clever.  The confirmed LG G6 aspect ratio just happens to be 18:9, breaking rank with the normal 16:9 standard. LG G6 specs for February 26 The LG G6 is a shaping up to be a big change for the South Korean company. It's been teasing a wide 5.7-inch display that still maintains a compact body. The phone is also supposed to be waterproof and with dual-lens camera and have a reliable battery – a deserved jab at the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 recall. This Android Nougat phone may also be the first to use the more advanced and VR-capable Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset with Quick Charge 4.0. Hopefully that means out with the inferior LG 360 VR and in with the Google Daydream View headset for mobile VR gaming and entertainment. February 26 is going to be pivotal for LG's mobile division. It needs to rebound from the hardly modular LG G5. Now is the right time if the Galaxy S8 doesn't show up for Samsung's comeback story until April. We'll be on the ground in Barcelona for MWC 2017, so stay tuned for further LG G6 news and subscribe to our YouTube channel for hands on videos.

Now we've gleaned from Nintendo Japan's press site that a completely depleted Switch handheld will take 3 hours to completely recharge via the dock or separately with the included Type-C AC adapter.     Nintendo has affirmed that the Switch's battery can last up to 6.5 hours in Mobile Mode, but this long life is likely prolonged via the system's Sleep Mode, which is enabled to extend the system's battery life while on-the-go.   Actual gameplay in Mobile Mode will likely be around the 3 or 4 hour mark, and while gamers can recharge the system as they play, the Switch's depleted recharging time will be as long as the actual system's play time.   What's more is that the Switch's 4310mAh, 3.7 V Li-ion battery may take longer to recharge on the dock, which transfers 5V DC across a 2.6A current, which equals 39W, than hooking the Switch directly up to a AC wall socket which will provide between 100W - 240W of converted AC power.   That's not to say that the Switch will leverage the full brunt of that power, however, as the device has a 3.7 V battery.   But in all actuality, taking 3 hours to recharge a 4310mAh battery isn't abnormal.   While Qualcomm-powered devices tout blazing-fast speeds with its new QuickCharge 3.0 technology, today's modern phones typically take multiple hours to charge.   For example, Google's new Pixel XL, which rocks a 3450mAh battery, takes 2 hours and 3 minutes to fully charge a depleted battery, whereas the iPhone 7 Plus (2900mAh) takes 3 hours and 27 minutes. Samsung's S7 Edge, which uses Qualcomm's Quick Charge 2.0 technology, takes just 1 hour 29 minutes to recharge its 3600mAh battery.   Read Also: Nintendo Switch hardware specs revealed     Nintendo Switch and USB Power Delivery 2.0   While the 3 hour recharge time indicates Nintendo Switch won't support quick charging, it could support USB-PD 2.0 (aka USB Power Delivery 2.0) which is a new spec that's wholly dedicated to recharging batteries via USB 3.1 (Type-C).     USB PD 2.0 offers power transfers up to 100W, allowing for quick-charging in certain devices--and batteries--capable of handling such an influx of power. 100W is usually reserved for larger devices such as monitors and laptops--not tablets.   "Almost at the same time as the USB 3.1 release, the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF) released the USB Power Delivery Specification. This new USB power delivery specification allows power transfers of up to 100 W, along with other features and benefits," reads a report on Electronic Design.   When docked, however, the Switch will only use 39W of the possible 100W of power that can be transferred via USB Type-C. We learned this in the Switch's official FCC filings:   AC Adapter output (from dock to handheld) DC 5 V - DC 15 V, 2.6 A - Switch has max power draw of 39W while charging on cradle*   AC Adapter input (from wall to dock) AC 100 - 240 V 50 / 60 Hz, 1 A - standardized power   *Basic formula to convert volts to watts is Watts = Volts x Amps, so we plug in the Switch's 15V times the 2.6A to get 39W, meaning the Switch will draw a max of 39W while docked.     But if the Switch supports this new battery-charging spec, why does it take 3 hours to recharge the 4310mAh battery?   How fast a device recharges depends on two major factors: the battery itself, and the cord that transmits said power. We don't everything about the Nintendo Switch's battery outside of it's capacity, that it's a lithium ion battery with a 3.7 V/cell rating, and that it doesn't support boosted turbo-charging, but we do know that rated power transfers of the AC adapter (see above).   In any case, this certainly gives players expectations about the Nintendo Switch and what to expect from its battery life.   The Nintendo Switch will release March 3, 2017 for $299.

A Qualcomm chip is smaller than a penny. Image: Qualcomm By Pete Pachal2017-01-19 01:27:33 UTC Analysis Qualcomm is in trouble. For most, those words probably mean next to nothing, but if you know much about the technology within your smartphone, it means a great deal. Qualcomm builds many of the key components of the world's smartphones — specifically, the modems and often the processors, too. It's also the dominant vendor in both categories. To smartphone users, the difference between a phone that uses a chip or modem from Qualcomm and some other brand is often measured in seconds — how long it takes to launch an app or call up a webpage, for instance. To the industry, it's measured in billions of dollars — the reward for making deals to get your technology into the hands of millions of people. And in the future, the difference could play a role in the 5G race.  SEE ALSO: The iPhone's remarkable 10-year history, in pictures Shady deals? For the last several years, Qualcomm has been particularly adept at making those deals, growing its market share even in the wake of public stumbles like the Snapdragon 810, a flagship chip that ended up prone to overheating. In particular, it's been the exclusive provider for modems on the iPhone since 2011 (at least until last year, when Apple began using Intel modems in some iPhone 7 models). An iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. Image: Mashable Now it looks like some of Qualcomm's deals may have been out of bounds. The Federal Trade Commission took the rather extreme step of suing Qualcomm over how it does business, and it's been very specific about it. In a nutshell, the FTC says Qualcomm is being a supreme dick about its patents, which allows the company to squeeze licensing fees from anyone it does business with. For a patent holder that's not entirely unexpected (or necessarily bad) except that Qualcomm's patents here are so fundamental to smartphone technology that they're considered standard-essentials patents — a special type that basically forces the patent holder to license them at a "reasonable rate." The FTC accuses Qualcomm of not doing that, but also that it went even further, basically forcing any smartphone maker to pay Qualcomm for phones that don't contain its modem tech, if they wanted to do business with Qualcomm at all. Not the first complaint Qualcomm's been accused of noncompetitive practices before, but they were from the South Korean and Chinese governments in Asia, whose interests happen to align with chip companies (like MediaTek and Samsung) based there. Not so this time. Qualcomm is a U.S. company, negating any claims of regional protectionism. "This is the third time they've had an antitrust suit," explains Tim Bajarin of Creative Strategies, a Silicon Valley market research firm. "There's no question that when you have these kind of suits, there has to be some kind of significant evidence or material that would force these antitrust lobbies to [act]." Naturally, any discussion of smartphone technology eventually drifts to Apple (call it Jobs' Law), and the company is pretty heavily involved in this. Allegedly, Qualcomm pressured Apple into using its modems in the iPhone from 2011 to 2016, effectively shutting out its competitors from working with the most influential smartphone maker in the world and hampering their development. (In that time Qualcomm's market share in mobile modems grew from 45% to 65%.) "Apple is the premium brand in smartphones," says Jan Dawson, a mobile industry analyst. "Every other brand is either not premium or a mixed bag of offerings. It's certainly more valuable as a relationship." Interesting tidbit: Those new Intel modems in the iPhone are apparently so much slower than Qualcomm's that Apple is throttling them so users have a consistent experience. Whether that's evidence in the FTC's favor or just bad engineering probably depends on whose side you're on. The Trump factor The bigger question is, will any of this matter under a Trump administration? Conventional wisdom says that a theoretically business-friendly Republican leadership won't be as excited to push the case forward, and the current FTC chair will step down on Feb. 10. However, Trump is said to be considering Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes as the replacement. Reyes hasn't been too kind to big tech companies in the past, so there's little reason to believe he would give Qualcomm a break here. (That is, if he ends up being Trump's pick.) "This is one of the very last actions of the outgoing FTC," Dawson says. "It's possible the case may not be pursued as aggressively as it would have. But remember, [Reyes] suggested going after Google. He probably won't give anybody a free pass." For its part, Qualcomm issued a defensive statement, essentially a non-denial denial that was very light on detail, apparently saving its point-by-point rebuttal for court. Considering the FTC filed its lawsuit in Apple's backyard of Northern California (as opposed to Qualcomm's home of SoCal), the witness testimony could get interesting. The 5G race If you've read this far, you may still be wondering how this affects you. Simple: 5G. Right now it's a future-tech buzzword, but in a year or two we'll start to hear about the first smartphones with 5G speeds. 5G promises smartphone connections faster than even today's wired internet, able to transfer gigabits per second (real-world LTE usually maxes out in the tens of megabits). 5G represents a new frontier for mobile internet players like Intel, MediaTek and others — especially since there are still billions (with a "b") of people who don't yet own a smartphone. It could be that Qualcomm, with its impressive patent collection and world-class team simply outplayed everybody in the age of LTE, and when 5G comes along it'll be more of the same. But if it's found to have stacked the deck in its favor and has to make changes, the 5G era could end up being a lot more competitive. That could get messy — modem performance could vary wildly between manufacturers and even individual models — but it could also give some innovative outliers the chance to shine. It all depends if the incoming FTC chair still thinks that's a future worth fighting for. We'll find out soon enough.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us New Gmail phishing technique making the rounds By Ida Torres - January 18, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter If you’ve received an email on your Gmail account that has led to a prompt to sign in with your account again, you better double check everything first before clicking on that. That’s because a new phishing technique has been making the rounds, mostly targeting unsuspecting Gmail users to steal their login credentials and effectively gain access to private information. While it may be more difficult to detect as even the more technical users have been hit, there are still ways to avoid this kind of fraud. It is harder to detect that it is a phishing technique since the email sometimes come from a contact who themselves may have been hacked in the same manner. It sometimes has an attachment of an image that you recognize from the sender. When you click it to see a preview, you will instead be led to a new tab where you will be asked to sign in and since you see an accounts.google.com thing somewhere in the location bar, you don’t think twice. But once you actually sign in, your account has already been compromised. The attackers would then almost immediately sign in to your account and have access to all your digital correspondence and may also use it to phish other accounts in your network. It is difficult to detect this as it has almost the same URL as a regular Gmail account and even the sign-in page looks almost the same. Google says they are “aware of the issue” and is working on strengthening their security, so you probably have to work on it yourself. So what you have to do is to be vigilant about looking at the URL. If it contains a long string of data, then that should raise your suspicion. Make sure there is nothing before the hostname, except for ‘https://’. Make sure to verify the protocol and also the hostname, and also enable two-factor authentication or verification so they won’t easily get access in case your main log-in has already been compromised.

A source at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland — where attendees this year include George and Amal Clooney, Joe Biden and Matt Damon — told Page Six: “One of the best and most exclusive parties in Davos every year is Anthony Scaramucci’s wine party,” called The Wine Forum. Said our spy, “The wine selection is off the charts, with the most expensive and best wines.” The invite this year said: “We are looking forward to hosting a fabulous evening of Bordeaux wines from some of the best recent vintages during the upcoming Davos week.” But this time around, we hear that in Davos, “people were walking around saying the most anticipated party is without its host.” Scaramucci’s name was not on the wine-party invitation, and he did not attend the event thanks to his new responsibilities. The bash is annually held at the Hotel Europe’s Piano Bar, where the elite meet after hours. Last year, Page Six reported that at the bash, Kevin Spacey was schmoozing with Third Point’s Daniel Loeb, Goldman Sachs’ Gary Cohn, Google’s Eric Schmidt, Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat and Andrew Ross Sorkin when the “House of Cards” star jumped up on the piano and started serenading the room. Reports said this year Scaramucci was in Davos for a day before heading back for the inauguration. But even without the party, Bloomberg.com dubbed him “this year’s surprise Davos star” as the “lone attendee from [the] incoming administration,” and, “Scaramucci found himself ‘jammed up’ with requests for his time.” He joked of his new role this year, “I brought a food taster.” Scaramucci knows his vino as an owner of power dining spot Hunt & Fish Club in Manhattan. He reportedly sold his SkyBridge Capital this week. Reps did not get back to us.

It’s a dangerously easy stereotype to peddle, but Pakistan were major architects in their own demise here. At 2/45 in the 10th over and slipping behind the required run-rate, the men in dark green will look back on Peter Handscomb’s no-ball dismissal and the ensuing dropped catch at point early in his innings as pivotal points in outcome of the match. All too often this fun yet frustrating side contrives to dismantle its advantage, and in international cricket you simply cannot be offering players second and third chances. Nevertheless it is well worth pointing out the performance of Mohammad Amir, who yet again showed himself to be a class above most peers on both sides. He treated us to another display of sublime control of both pace and arc, and he can be satisfied with his efforts today. The day belonged to opposition captain Steve Smith though, who rode the storm of the early Pakistan onslaught to guide Australia home. He was gifted some fairly innocuous spin through those middle overs, but still managed to control the chase with free-scoring through all parts of the ground. His prime compadre, Peter Handscomb, would have relished the opportunity to spend time in the middle with the Australian captain, as both look to solidify Australia’s middle order in all forms now and into the future. Smith was named player of the match, and praised his bowlers for their ability to “restrict them to 260 odd when it was a 320 wicket.” While the result was ultimately a comfortable one for Australia, at 2-1 the series still hangs in the balance. We move to the SCG on Sunday for its first international ODI of the summer, where we’ll bring you coverage of the match, as ever, on the good ship OBO.

He was cautiously handled in his ultimate over with five dots from it, though Head managed to jump-tuck one off his hip for four through fine leg. Another excellent exhibition of quick bowling from Amir, with little support from those around him it has to be said.

Another single keeps the score ticking over, but this was comfortably the best over for Pakistan in a long while.

He offers a loosener that Smith doesn’t waste - belting a pull shot for four through mid wicket. We’re now looking forward to the breaking of more records. There’s a partnership record up for grabs and Handscomb nears a hundred on debut. Balls are run fine to third man and the strike is ticked over. Amir reminds Smith at the over’s death that he does retain wheels, forcing an ungainly evasion from one aimed at the helmet. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.22am EST 05:22 38th over: Australia 220-2 (Smith 89, Handscomb 80) Imad’s off and Hasan’s back, hooray! It is reasonably difficult to understand the rationale behind maintaining Imad for eight overs of ease, but if there’s a master plan about to unfold then consider me mistaken. Hasan creates trouble almost immediately - he has Handscomb in two minds and french cutting for a fortunate boundary, then it happens again! To compound the frustration, Handscomb then finely steers Hasan past second slip for four from the back foot - this one was far more deliberate. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.17am EST 05:17 37th over: Australia 207-2 (Smith 88, Handscomb 68) There’s another boundary through the backstop/fine-leg region in an almost carbon copy of Handscomb’s shot two overs ago - though this time it’s Smith. It’s evident that the Australian’s are scoring runs at will. Whereas Handscomb was fairly rooted to his crease early, here he is walking around his crease in an effort to manipulate the ball wherever he pleases. He succeeds. A smart flick wide of mid on sees the over finish with another three, taking the tally to ten this time.

Nine this time. Why not Hafeez, Hasan, or Amir? Three guys who can genuinely be happy with their figures so far. Handscomb fancies square leg this time, taking his runs through there, usually after coming down the wicket. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.09am EST 05:09 35th over: Australia 188-2 (Smith 78, Handscomb 59) So it’s the left-handed Junaid who’s brought back by Hafeez, but are the Australian’s too far gone? Smith’s likes the third ball of each over for a boundary, and he’s the same here. He leans on Junaid’s only-slightly overpitched ball and pierces the gap between mid-off and cover. Handscomb then gets some luck, top edging an attempted pull that lands somewhere between backstop and fine leg for four. Eleven off the over. The horse has bolted here.

He goes for another seven; the boundary coming again through a Smith sweep.

The over’s exclamation mark comes through a half sweep, half hoick over the square leg umpire’s head. Hafeez surely has to roll the dice with Amir, Junaid and Hasan now. Seam worked for them early, and spin has hurt them here. ICC (@ICC) Leading from the front!

It hasn’t taken long for the St Kilda clubman to ingratiate himself into the Australian batting group, has it? He rode his luck here, finding his fifty after a no-ball dismissal and being dropped along the way. Once again, there’s runs from the final ball of the over - Smith cuts hard behind point for three. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.51am EST 04:51 31st over: Australia 155-2 (Smith 57, Handscomb 47) New bowler for Pakistan as Shoaib Malik enters the fray. I heard earlier today that he made his ODI debut at the WACA as an 18-year-old in 2000, which is fairly extraordinary. His introduction is probably a big moment in the match, and if the innings has been any indication, Australia will look to take runs from the spinner. He is, after all, the sixth bowler. Handscomb back-cuts him for three early on, and shows his wares by making room for himself later on to go over cover. Malik follows him though, forcing the Victorian to hit through leg. He continues in that vein though, and sweeps Malik four four behind square from his final ball. Eleven from the over. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.45am EST 04:45 30th over: Australia 145-2 (Smith 55, Handscomb 39) Another over with six from it. The prevailing thought is that wickets in hand will allow Australia the freedom to accelerate late. Hafeez must see things slightly differently, as he continues his policy of defence through Imad’s spell. Australia are picking up singles readily, though the required run rate still hovers at a run-a-ball. The wicket indicates that it may not be so easy, though perhaps I’m thinking too wishfully. That’s the hundred partnership for Smith and Handscomb. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.41am EST 04:41 29th over: Australia 139-2 (Smith 52, Handscomb 37) Handscomb glides one down to third man and picks up more runs through a couple of scoring shots late in the over: first a pull from one that kept a little low for two, second a hook that garners him three - it would have been four if not for some solid fielding from Malik in the deep. Dan Liebke (@LiebCricket) Great tactics from Pakistan to refuse to dismiss the obviously nervous and slow-scoring Handscomb. Outwitting the Australians. #AUSvPAK January 19, 2017 Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.37am EST 04:37 28th over: Australia 132-2 (Smith 51, Handscomb 31) Imad appears to be a fairly favourable proposition for these two, as he leaks more singles down to longs off and on. Along the way Smith brings up his fifty. He survived a fairly tough examination early, though never relented on his scoring pace (58 balls). It’s unwise to say this, but he looks fairly impregnable here. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.33am EST 04:33 27th over: Australia 127-2 (Smith 49, Handscomb 28) Aside from Amir, Hasan has stemmed the flow of runs better than the rest - it’s probably this logic that sees him back on. He continues where he left off, and even emits the first false stroke for a while - Handscomb playing and missing at one that leaves him off the wicket. More respect shown to the medium-fast operator, there’s only two from this over. Updated at 4.34am EST Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.30am EST 04:30 26th over: Australia 125-2 (Smith 48, Handscomb 27) More ease for Australia, though the over is punctuated somewhat by an LBW appeal to an advancing Handscomb. It was reminiscent of Smith’s dismissal here against South Africa earlier in the summer. It’s a different result this time. So often these successful chases are defined by boundaries well-timed in both senses. Here Handscomb advances again and lifts Imad over forward square for a soul-destroying boundary of the last ball of the over. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.27am EST 04:27 25th over: Australia 118-2 (Smith 47, Handscomb 22) Singles every ball with a boundary in the middle to Smith, caressed through cover. At the halfway mark, it’s now fair to say Australia has the ascendancy. Have Pakistan retreated to defence too quickly? For all the mayhem and swagger and danger produced in the early exchanges, it’s all a little tame now. Without doubt, Smith and Handscomb have weathered the storm. The onus is on Pakistan to create something now. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.23am EST 04:23 24th over: Australia 110-2 (Smith 41, Handscomb 20) So the partnership builds a little here and it’s spin from both ends now for Pakistan. It’s another festival of singles as both sides enter conservative, arm-wrestle mode. Smith finally grabs two via a cut to the point boundary. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.21am EST 04:21 23rd over: Australia 105-2 (Smith 37, Handscomb 19) While Smith accelerates into his innings, Handscomb’s feels a little more laboured. He drives Hafeez down to long on, but not before the ball spends an alarming amount of time in the air. Hafeez may have got a fingertip to a potential return-catch, but the ball evades him. We’re on the long-off, long-on carousel of singles here - though an interesting little moment when Hafeez pauses just before delivering, and looks directly at the non-striker Handscomb, as though to tell him he’s way too far beyond his crease. He combines it with a retiring apology. I call that good diplomacy. Handscomb can consider himself warned. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.17am EST 04:17 22nd over: Australia 102-2 (Smith 39, Handscomb 18) Hasan has been economical - he runs in very straight and close to the stumps, he makes a duck-face upon delivery, he bowls in-swingers that do enough, and he’s clearly earned the respect of his opposition. A few singles are followed by a swivel-pull shot from Smith that almost beats deep square leg but a diving hand prevents a boundary; he gets two. Updated at 4.24am EST Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.12am EST 04:12 21st over: Australia 95-2 (Smith 32, Handscomb 16) Handscomb misses out on a Hafeez full toss that probably surprised him, though it’s fortuitous as the ensuing single precedes a six over mid-off from Smith’s bat. He shows the full face and arc of the bat all the way through - does anyone extend their arms and contort their body in such an exaggerated motion as does Smith? Singles round out another good over from Australia, who have fought their way back to something approaching parity here. A pretty good contest, all-told.

The captain finds two more via a whip from outside off (where else?) where they make the most of a a pick up that is anything but clean. Handscomb ensures he makes his ground with an extravagant dive, and the over ends with seven from it. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.04am EST 04:04 19th over: Australia 79-2 (Smith 18, Handscomb 14) A bit of rotation from Hafeez, who reintroduces himself into the attack. The breeze seems to be picking up, which lends a flightiness to his off-spinners and a daring invitation to the Australian batsmen. It’s an invitation knocked back - probably wise, if Smith’s leading edge to complete the over is anything to go by. A maiden!

Hasan’s into his second over and conceded a couple of singles to third man before he garners is misstroke from Smith that rolls through to Rizwan behind the stumps. The Australian captain then finds three runs through the offside, standing tall and punching between cover and point. Five off the over, honours even. Smith warming up now. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.57am EST 03:57 17th over: Australia 73-2 (Smith 13, Handscomb 13) Change of bowler for Pakistan, that will likely be well received by their opposition. It’s Imad’s left arm orthodox and he’s coming around the wicket to the Australian right handers. Whereas Handscomb favours his back foot to pace, he’s almost compulsively dancing to spinners. He gets one which brings his captain on strike, who breaks the shackles with consecutive boundaries - one cut behind point, the other worked through mid wicket after skipping down the wicket. Australia needed that. It forces a fielding change, one that allows Smith to milk one to long on. Imad follows up with a wide to Handscomb, and there’s a single to finish. A much-needed big over for Australia, twelve off it. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.52am EST 03:52 16th over: Australia 61-2 (Smith 4, Handscomb 11) It’s been a wild ride so far - appeals, no balls, and dropped catches all threatening to shape this game. Meanwhile Australia has dropped below four an over in this period of extended consolidation. You have to hand it to the Pakistan bowlers, who - for the last three or four overs - have been exceptional. Conversation builds in the nine comm box about the growing number of no-balls that are being missed. Rather than that signalling a little luck from an Australian point of view, Moody in particular is lamenting the number of free hits they’re missing. Only two from the over, full of leaves and back foot defence.

He then edges one that falls just short of slip, though the hands felt soft and there was a modicum of control. The Victorian then absolutely middles a cut shot that’s dropped at backward point by Nawaz! Handscomb riding his luck majorly. It turns out that would have been a no-ball too. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.41am EST 03:41 14th over: Australia 57-2 (Smith 3, Handscomb 8) Back to two slips for Amir now as the spice diminishes fractionally from the mayhem of the last few overs. Smith and Handscomb consolidate here with a couple of runs behind square; both are content to let the ball come to them and to leave if offered. Amir has 1/18 from seven overs here, which shows how dominant he’s been. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.38am EST 03:38 13th over: Australia 54-2 (Smith 3, Handscomb 5) Handscomb’s back and across movement is only slightly less pronounced than Smith’s, but clearly there’s a line of thinking about it that we’re not full privy too yet. It would be great to try and understand, as conventional thinking would have it that balls aimed at the stumps would necessitate an across-the-line stroke. It doesn’t seem to hamper either batsmen, though it does seem to confound Tom Moody and Michael Slater in the commentary box. There’s a loud appeal from Rizwan for caught behind towards the end of the over, that again no one else seems to hear. Nothing comes of it. Here’s Paul Wilson stopping Pete Handscomb from leaving the field following Amir’s no ball. cricket.com.au (@CricketAus) BLOCKER!

Handscomb’s debut nerves are palpable as his feet don’t seem to dance as swiftly as his reputation (on and off the field) dictates. Only one from the over. Complete aside, I just saw an advertisement for The Book of Mormon. Not the musical, the genuine article. It was soft and earnest and it jarred me, primarily because I’m used to seeing loud commericals about beers and paint and TVs. A new campaign coinciding with the arrival of the musical in Melbourne, possibly? Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.29am EST 03:29 11th over: Australia 51-2 (Smith 1, Handscomb 4) It’s really difficult to ignore Smith’s back and across trigger movement. He’s in Katich territory now, surely? At the moment of contact for his first single, you can genuinely see all three stumps. I’m not judging it negatively though - a bit of difference is more interesting than not. Handscomb then tries to lash Junaid through the offside and is caught! Pakistan are cock-a-hoop until we see that it’s a huge no ball! A huge let-off for Australia, who would have been in major trouble had that been legitimate. Handscomb whacks the ensuing ball (a free hit) over mid wicket for what looks like a six before the ball plugs dramatically, one metre short of the boundary. It’s four all-run. Only four balls gone, what a frantic over! Pakistan has three slips in now and are ‘up and about’, as the AFL types would say. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.21am EST 03:21 10th over: Australia 45-2 (Smith 0, Handscomb 0) After some innocuous stuff Khawaja plays and misses to another Amir gem and Amir goes up vociferously! No one else seems to, however, and captain Hafeez decides against a review. He’s called for a wide again before taking Khawaja’s wicket, described below. Enter Pete Handscomb, notionally on debut though it doesn’t feel quite as dramatic as those scenes in Adelaide. There is some familiarity in that back-foot commitment though, which we see displayed immediately. He gets some lip from Amir too! Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.19am EST 03:19 WICKET! Khawaja c Rizwan b Amir 9 (20) Another one! Amir deserved this. Khawaja tries to blaze him through cover but the ball just nips in off the seam, taking the under edge of Khawaja’s blade and is taken comfortably by Rizwan. Khawaja hangs around for Smith’s view, which is strange given you’d imagine he would have felt the edge himself. He’s sent on his way and Pakistan are on top. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.14am EST 03:14 WICKET! Warner c Rizwan b Junaid 35 (38) Junaid has the last laugh! Warner, attempting to hit Junaid yet again through the offside, only succeeds in edging him. It was wide enough but probably too full for that flurry - and the ball didn’t seem to swing too much. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.13am EST 03:13 9th over: Australia 44-1 (Smith 0, Khawaja 9) And so Warner retains strike, again, this over. Junaid is his target, and he bottom edges a lusty pull shot for four to start things off. Hard not to consider how advantageous bats are these days (sorry for the cliche), but he barely got any piece of that ball. Perhaps attempting to cash in on that momentum, he plays what appears to be a back-footed tennis forehand that initially appears to go straight in the air. it in fact sailed a fair distance over mid-off before plugging - Warner picked up two for that. A 50 metre top-edge, that. Crazy stuff. Warner then tries to hammer him through the off-side again but edges behind and he’s gone! Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.08am EST 03:08 8th over: Australia 38-0 (Warner 29, Khawaja 9) Warner is treating Amir with respect here. He’s extremely watchful of anything aimed at his pads, such is the Pakistan opener’s ability to swing the ball. He hares off strike again with soft hands on the off side but is quickly back on. Amir beats him with a ripper, this time on the inside of his bat - an in-swinger. This is proving a pretty decent spell from Amir. Warner runs one down to third man for one to finish the over. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.05am EST 03:05 7th over: Australia 35-0 (Warner 27, Khawaja 8) Perhaps buoyed by his left armed pace brethren, Junaid commences with a far tighter line this over. He can’t elicit the same swing as Amir, though there’s little shame in that. He works his way into his spell and produces another half-shout for lbw in vain. That pressure creates a run out chance the following back. Warner, at the non strikers end, thinks there’s one before being sent back by his partner. Shoiab Malik fires in from mid-on and replays show a direct hit would have sent Warner packing. There wasn’t one in it. As is often the way, Khawaja then gracefully drives Junaid past mid-off for four to finish the over. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.58am EST 02:58 6th over: Australia 30-0 (Warner 26, Khawaja 4) Ah, the symmetry, the parabola’s, of Mohammad Amir. He positively winds two balls past Warner’s immense blade - twice enticing him into a defensive prod before curling away at the last moment. Warner finally gets bat on one and hares off strike; a wise ploy. It’s some effort to force Warner into that level of submission when he’s in this mood - whatever of Australia’s ascendancy right now, it’s further proof of Amir’s incredible ability. Khawaja is treated something a little less threatening and leaves his way to the end of the over: a good one for Pakistan. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.55am EST 02:55 5th over: Australia 29-0 (Warner 25, Khawaja 4) Junaid’s now introduced into the attack, coming left-arm over to Warner who continues to retain the strike. The man from Matraville tries to pull a fullish ball immediately and misses - the bounce renders Pakistan’s muted appeal moot. Warner tries precisely the same thing next ball and gets the result he’s after. This one was a little shorter; Warner picked it up nonchalantly. The next one’s wide and Warner deals with it too - another boundary. He’s doing it easy here Warner, playing square from the crease on both sides. He toes another pull shot and gets three.

Eleven from the over Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.49am EST 02:49 4th over: Australia 18-0 (Warner 18, Khawaja 4) Amir errs with one short and wide and is duly punished by Warner, who almost gives himself some room as he slashes him through point for a boundary from the first ball. That sets up the over well for Australia; Warner then finds two behind square that for most would have been one. Continuing with that opportunism, he tries to stand and deliver from a good length Amir delivery, succeeding only in inside edging it behind square leg. He steals one from that too. Australia are away. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.46am EST 02:46 3rd over: Australia 11-0 (Warner 7, Khawaja 4) A circumspect Khawaja takes a look at Hafeez’s first couple of balls - surviving one half shout for a ball that pops off his pad to short-leg - before he dances down the deck and employs his elegant wrists in flicking one over mid-wicket for four. Hafeez nearly sneaks one through Khawaja on the back foot later on but his bat just jams down quickly enough. Four off the over.

His two catchers are at first and second slip, and with his full length they appear well positioned. Warner works one off his hip for two, but remains scoreless from the over otherwise. Khawaja’s yet to face a ball, but he’s on strike next over. You feel that if Amir’s full he’ll be a chance.

The Australian is immediately cutting hard, and finds the boundary after running one fine to the left of 1st slip. Hafeez has a man under the lid too - something you don’t normally see to Warner in an ODI. He runs one down to long on to make it five from the over. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.35am EST 02:35 Hello Sam Perry Morning, afternoon and evening all. From the top a huge thanks to Geoff for his first innings efforts. It’s always an entertaining wander into high end verbiage, metaphor and reference - he didn’t disappoint today. I’d also like to echo his sign off and hat tip to Rachael Heyhoe Flint, a legend of the game. To the match: we’re in the murky depths of a five match ODI series here, aren’t we? The second innings of the third fixture with the home side chasing a steady total. Everything looked set for Pakistan to set something close to 300 before Hazlewood and his merry men tightened things markedly enough to render this chase eminently achievable, you’d imagine. Whatever the case, the prospect of Warner and Maxwell on fast wickets is always enough to justify closer inspection - but as ever, Australia do have a collapse in them, as the last fixture between these two show. Can Pakistan carry on their recent bowling ascendancy over Australia or will Smith’s men prove too powerful? It’s Warner and Khawaja to open the batting.

Business Microsoft Real Estate Technology Salesforce shows off new office tower in Bellevue Originally published January 18, 2017 at 6:45 pm Updated January 19, 2017 at 9:37 am A Salesforce executive says the new Bellevue office space would be among the company’s largest engineering hubs. (Studio216) The San Francisco business software giant joins other Silicon Valley tech companies establishing a firm presence in the Seattle area. Share story By Matt Day Seattle Times technology reporter Salesforce.com has joined the ranks of Bay Area tech companies boasting gleaming new Seattle-area office space, showcasing new Bellevue digs to elected officials and journalists on Wednesday. The company in the past couple of weeks moved the bulk of its Seattle-area employees into the top three stories of the 19-floor 929 Office Tower, a new building on 108th Avenue Northeast. The company didn’t disclose its current employee head count, but spokespersons said they expected to reach the 500-person threshold “in the coming months.” Previously, Salesforce occupied office space in downtown Seattle, as well as an office inherited from marketing firm ExactTarget in Bellevue.

Elizabeth Pinkham, Salesforce’s executive vice president of real estate, said the new office space would be among the company’s largest engineering hubs. Salesforce, based in San Francisco, is a fast-growing software company best known for building customer-relationship management tools for tracking sales and customer-service interactions. The company has long been a colorful insurgent in the staid world of business software, occasionally picking fights with the likes of Microsoft. Chief Executive Marc Benioff, a former Oracle executive, took a sabbatical on Hawaii’s Big Island before founding Salesforce in 1999. Subsequently, his new company adopted the term ohana, Hawaiian for family. The newest addition to that family was inaugurated Wednesday in front of a few-dozen lei-clad employees. “We’re very pleased to have you as part of the business community,” Bellevue Mayor John Stokes said. “You’re coming at a great time.” Salesforce’s move to Bellevue comes amid a hiring boom as companies try to tap in to the software-engineering talent seeded in the area by anchor tenants Microsoft and Amazon.com. Amazon continues to expand its massive urban campus in Seattle, and Facebook and Google both recently announced plans for new offices in the city. Expedia, headquartered in Bellevue, is working on a move to Seattle. Salesforce’s new home, about 70,000 square feet, comes with standard-issue industry perks, including snack bars, a coffee shop peddling high-end brews, and ample meeting spaces and work rooms. Views from the east side of the building include the Cascades, while the perspective from the other sides of the building give the full picture of Bellevue’s rising skyline. Salesforce is also reshaping the look of its hometown. The Salesforce Tower, in San Francisco’s SoMa neighborhood, is a 1,070-foot skyscraper scheduled to be the second biggest tower west of the Mississippi behind the Wilshire Grand Center of Los Angeles.

New research suggests "virus" patterns can be spotted and possibly help predict and even prevent shootings. But questions remain of whether this can be done ethically, and, most crucially, who can be trusted with this predictive technology. Visualisation: Jim Cooke/Gizmodo A recent study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association uses contagion models to track and predict the next victims of gun violence. The authors, Yale sociology professor and Chicago native Andrew Papachristos, and Harvard students Ben Green and Thibault Morel, studied nine years of gun violence data from Chicago, totaling over 13,000 shootings. The arrest records, along with the info on gun violence, were sourced from the Chicago Police Department (the dataset excluded suicide, accidental discharges and police shootings). The researchers concluded that bullets follow a path of familiarity, spreading in a pattern resembling a virus. "[Gang violence] looks more like a blood-borne pathogen than it does a flu, per say," Papachristos told Gizmodo. "You don't catch a bullet like you catch a cold, [but] the power of this analogy is really thinking about the precision with which it moves through a population." Image: Green B, Horel T, Papachristos AV. Modelling Contagion Through Social Networks to Explain and Predict Gunshot Violence in Chicago, 2006 to 2014 Papachristos suggests that riding in a gang means taking on all the grudges and affiliations of people in the same crew. So, per his example, a trip to the 7-Eleven turns deadly for Individual A because he arrives with Individual B, who has beef with rival gang members already present when they arrive. Individual A has no beef with them, and may not have been targeted if he'd arrived alone. Thus, in this analogy, Individual B has "infected" Individual A with gun violence, meaning Individual B's influence has made Individual A a target. Papachristos and his colleagues found that gun violence "moved" in Chicago like HIV — appearing predictably within a concentrated network in social interactions that involve "risky" behaviour. "Any good preacher, teacher, cop, football coach, they know these networks," he said. "They live in these networks. But they only see a small part of it. We've just provided a whole map." To create the map, the researchers looked at pairs of Chicago residents who co-offended (meaning they were arrested together), creating a complex social network of 138, 163 individuals. Within this network, gun violence emanated outwards from one victim, "infecting" the people around him. The closer you were to someone who was just shot, the more likely you were to soon be shot yourself. Seventy per cent of nonfatal gun violence could be tracked to networks containing less than 5 per cent of the city's population — the victims and perpetrators were usually in overlapping social circles. Green B, Horel T, Papachristos AV. Modelling Contagion Through Social Networks to Explain and Predict Gunshot Violence in Chicago, 2006 to 2014 In theory, knowing who is most likely to be shot offers a chance to intervene and save lives. Papachristos says he imagines a localised rapid response system where nonprofits will offer their services to someone the system flags. But others have voiced serious ethical concerns with the use of predicative models, specifically, in law enforcement. Jessica Saunders, a senior criminologist with nonprofit RAND Corporation who studies the efficacy of predictive technologies, says researchers who rely on data from law enforcement may be working on incomplete data, skewing the results. "My real big problem," Saunders said, "is that we are taking these predictions and pretending they're accurately predicting the real truth." Saunders pointed out that any law enforcement biases that went into compiling a criminal dataset will likely become embedded into statistical models and their resultant extrapolations. (These biases, which include racial profiling and the overpolicing of black and Latino neighbourhoods, can be observed in the analysis of NYPD and CPD arrest and stop-and-frisk data. Bias is also evident in the likelihood of police violence towards people of colour — the kind of violence not factored into this specific study.) Incomplete data becomes a serious problem as predictive technology becomes more and more commonplace. "At least 40 per cent of crimes aren't reported," she said. "So if you build these complicated, sophisticated models on incomplete data, all you're doing is replicating whatever bias there was in inputting the data." Without safeguards to prevent bias from creeping into statistical models, or prevent misuse of the information those models deliver, what "could" happen is terrifying. The ACLU's Jay Stanley imagines a Black Mirror-esque dystopian future where all citizens are given predictive criminality/at-risk scores, which cops are able to see via augmented reality Google glasses. It sounds like a nightmarish invasion of privacy, but the technology to make it happen exists: augmented reality is common place, body camera manufactures are already exploring face recognition technologies (Google bans them on Glass), and here, we have the calculative potential to Minority Report someone's chance of committing a future crime. ACLU: Chicago Police "Heat List" Renews Old Fears About Government Flagging and Tagging Papachristos acknowledges the possibility for overreach, but says he envisions his models being used by non-profits to create a holistic approach to gun violence prevention that includes offering potential victims resources like health care, employment, education with a much higher degree of specificity. "We're trying to move the dialogue about saving the lives of these young men, most of whom have a criminal record, as the focus as opposed to saying, you know, let's just throw more policing resources at them," Papachristos said. Although predictive technologies present a certain vision of the future, the specifics 0f how they will be used going forward are not clear. Looking at the many barriers to fairness and transparency we see in the present evinces there's still much work to be done to prevent abuse. It's pointless to predict gun violence if those predictions only serve as statistical justification for biased police overreach. Saunders and Papachristos are both against police using statistical data to target anyone, but neither can predict that they won't. As Papachristos put it, "I can't control what people are gonna do with the work that we've done."

Another interesting device that was launched by the company last year was the Redmi Pro, which was Xiaomi's first smartphone with a dual lens camera and a deca-core processor. It was also the most expensive offering in the Redmi series at a starting price of $225. I managed to spend some time with the smartphone and was quite impressed by it. The Redmi Pro has three variants based on the CPU, RAM, and storage, which are as follows: 3GB RAM, 32GB storage, and Helio X20 chipset - RMB 1,499 (~$225) 4GB RAM, 64GB storage, and Helio X25 chipset - RMB 1,699 (~$255) 4GB RAM, 128GB storage, and Helio X25 chipset - RMB 1,999 (~$300) For someone familiar with other Redmi series devices such as the Redmi 3 or the Redmi Note 3, these may seem a bit too pricey. However, the device's pricing is similar to the Moto G4 Plus ($249), which is widely considered as a good value for money smartphone, while aiming to offer an affordable flagship level product. I received the base variant of the Redmi Pro with 3GB RAM, 32GB storage, and the deca-core Helio X20 chipset clocked up to 2.11GHz. Read on to know more about the device. Specifications 5.5-inch Full HD (1920x1080) AMOLED capacitive screen protected with 2.5D curved Gorilla Glass 3 CPU: Helio X20 MT6797 deca-core chipset with clock speed up to 2.11GHz 3GB RAM / 32GB ROM, microSD card support up to 128GB Dual 13MP + 5MP rear cameras with dual-tone LED flash, PDAF, f/2.0 aperture, supports 1080p video recording at 30 frames per second 5MP front-facing camera Lithium polymer 4,050mAh battery MIUI 8.0.1 based on Android 6.0 Marshmallow Hybrid dual-SIM support Home button with fingerprint sensor Network bands supported: 2G: GSM 850/900/1800/1900MHz, 3G: WCDMA 850/900/1800/1900MHz 4G: LTE 850/900/1800/2100/2600MHz TD-LTE 1900/2300/2500/2600MHz Bluetooth 4.2 NFC Support: No USB Type-C connector Dimensions: 151.5 x 76.2 x 8.2mm Weight: 174 grams What's in the box? Like most of its smartphone packaging, Xiaomi has gone with an iPhone-like box with minimal content inside for the Redmi Pro. The company isn't providing any extra accessories such as adapter cables, screen protectors or back covers with the device. Inside the box, there is the phone itself, a charging adapter, and a USB Type-C cable. Since the Redmi Pro is priced in the mid-range bracket, I was once again expecting Xiaomi to ship a pair of earphones with it. However, those were once again missing from the box. Hardware & Design The Redmi Pro looks great and feels even better in the hand. The metal unibody feels very sturdy and the brushed chrome finish helps the device look brand new all the time. On the front of the smartphone, it has a physical home button which is also the fingerprint sensor. This is a bit different from the Redmi 3S Prime, Redmi Note 3, and the Mi Max, which have rear-mounted fingerprint sensors. However, in the case of the Redmi Pro, the rear side houses the dual-camera module and having the fingerprint sensor on the back would have made it look busy. The device looks a lot like the Galaxy Note 4 or the OnePlus 3 from the front, but the rear side looks rather unique due to the vertically positioned dual cameras. The Redmi Pro is very slippery and slides off the palms often. Putting a cover on it is necessary, even more so if you have small hands like me. Other than this particular issue, the device is of top notch quality and I was very pleased with its build. Display Unlike its other mid-range offerings such as the Redmi Note 3 and the Mi Max, Xiaomi has fitted the Redmi Pro with an AMOLED screen. The 5.5-inch display has a resolution of 1920x1080 (Full HD) which translates to a pixel density of 401 pixels per inch. Xiaomi has done a decent job with the color calibration, but for certain colors such as orange and pink I felt that it was slightly off. The screen managed to brighten up significantly in direct sunlight and was quite visible until as low as 35% brightness. In normal conditions, the viewing experience with the Redmi Pro was very good. It is probably the best screen you would get in a mid-range smartphone and is an ideal one for watching photos and videos. Cosmetically, the 2.5D curved screen doesn't look as rounded as the UMi Max or the Nubia Z11 Max smartphones. This is mostly due to the plastic lining around the Redmi Pro's edges. Overall, the display was pretty good and it's nice to see a decent AMOLED unit in a mid-range device. Samsung has already begun shipping AMOLEDs in its entry-level J series smartphones and other manufacturers might also increase adoption of OLED in the near future. Audio & Call Quality The call quality on the Redmi Pro was average and I had to move around to get clear sound on many occasions. It was at its best in outdoor conditions but deteriorated significantly inside buildings. I used the smartphone on Vodafone India's 4G network and Jio 4G throughout my time with it. Since both carriers are still in early stages of 4G LTE rollout here, it's rather difficult to say who is at fault for the call quality issues indoors. The data connectivity was quite good on both the networks, even in places where it fell back on 3G. Anyone looking to order the smartphone for use in the US or Europe should look for the supported bands. The audio quality for music and other media was quite good from both the loudspeaker and the headphone jack. The loudspeaker is very loud and even at the highest volume level there was no tearing or crackling. I used a pair of Sennheiser earphones for testing the audio output from the 3.5mm port which I found to be quite good. Xiaomi offers custom presets for its own earphones and headsets, but since none of those are bundled with the device, I cannot comment upon how they sound. Camera The most hyped feature of the Redmi Pro is its dual-camera and rightly so, as it is quite a promising module for a mid-range smartphone. I enjoyed using the camera and features such as Stereo mode for selective focus, 3D mode, and manual focus are very well implemented by Xiaomi. Specifications-wise, the dual-camera is a combination of a 13-megapixel camera and a 5-megapixel camera, which captures images simultaneously and processes them to give a sharper image with sufficient lighting and depth of field. It isn't an obvious difference from usual high-quality images, but zooming into some of the pictures reveals slightly more detail. The rear camera is capable of shooting very good photos in most lighting conditions except very low light such as street lights. There is sufficient clarity in each of the images shot in daylight and the colors also look great. The Stereo mode allows the user to focus on certain objects and create a bokeh-like effect as well. Such images can also be seen in 3D mode, as in tilting the phone gives you an idea of the surroundings up to a very limited angle. In case of video, the camera is capable of shooting at 1080p resolution at 30 frames per second, with higher framerates available at lower resolutions. The video quality is quite good in both day and night conditions. However, for distant shooting in low light, the camera loses focus and is not that useful. You can check out some of the camera samples below: Images taken with the 5-megapixel front camera were also quite good. However, the color retention left a lot to be desired. I was happy with the images produced by the Redmi Pro in most cases, even more so with those captured by the rear camera and I'd certainly call it a good camera phone for its price. Software Like the Redmi 3S Prime, the Redmi Pro also comes pre-loaded with Xiaomi's heavily customized MIUI 8 skin on top of Android 6.0 Marshmallow. However, this device is yet to hit global markets and comes with the Chinese MIUI build with basic English language support in Xiaomi's own apps and no Play Store. Google apps can be installed using a third-party installer. Once Xiaomi releases a global ROM, it should contain Google apps and services. The OS itself was very smooth on the Redmi Pro and there were barely any issues in regular smartphone usage, despite the lack of full English support. Apps and games functioned smoothly without any force close prompts. Microsoft Exchange sync was a bit problematic for me as it never managed to update contacts that I edited on the phone. Other than this particular issue, I didn't have much to complain about the software. It should be noted that the user experience is different from stock Android, and users who aren't familiar with MIUI will need some time to get used to it. You can read a bit more about MIUI in our Mi Max review from last year. Performance The Redmi Pro is one of the few devices that use MediaTek's flagship deca-core chipsets, the Helio X20 and X25. Our review device features the Helio X20 clocked at 2.11GHz and 3GB of RAM. Even though these are the lowest specs for this device, my experience with the device was very good. App load times and frame rates in games such as Clash Royale and Dead Trigger. Benchmark results for the Helio X20 are also quite impressive as it managed to come close to some of the flagship chipsets such as the Snapdragon 801 and Snapdragon 810. This is not a bad metric at all, given the Redmi Pro's $225 pricing. The smartphone is capable of handling heavy multi-tasking with ease and I never managed to fully utilize its RAM as Xiaomi has implemented some optimization under the hood. In Geekbench, I was quite surprised to see that the Redmi Pro scored higher than Snapdragon 820-powered Galaxy S7 and Galaxy Note7 in single-core and multi-core tests. However, benchmark scores don't often give you the complete picture and the device might be slow in certain tasks. In the case of the Redmi Pro, that wasn't an issue either and its ability to perform regular tasks without slowing down is quite impressive. Battery The 4,050mAh Battery on the Redmi Pro lasts at least a day of heavy usage on a single charge, while moderate usage can keep the phone ticking for another half day. The same capacity battery on the Redmi 3S Prime lasts for two days, however, that smartphone is powered by the power-efficient Snapdragon 430 chipset and also features a smaller 5-inch 720p screen. Xiaomi has added battery optimization features in MIUI, but these are often problematic since they stop push notifications from certain apps from going through. With the optimizations disabled, the battery life reduces by about a couple of hours. However, it is something the user might consider disabling if they are constantly missing notifications or experiencing delayed sync. Like most smartphones available, the Redmi Pro too has a battery saver feature that can extend the standby time by up to three hours. It disables sync, background tasks and data connectivity, but can be configured as per priority and it works perfectly fine. Charging the smartphone with the bundled charger takes about 2.5 hours, and there is no mention of support for any quick charging technology. Conclusion The Redmi Pro is a very good smartphone and once again Xiaomi has struck the perfect balance between features and pricing. Its top variants may be perceived as expensive by some, but they do have additional storage, RAM, and a better chipset in them. While the Moto G4 and G4 Plus are highly recommended smartphones due to their availability in a majority of markets with guaranteed software updates, someone looking for a slightly premium smartphone with a dual camera, without spending a lot can consider the Redmi Pro. Another dual camera smartphone worth considering is the Huawei Honor 8, which is now available for $120 more than the Redmi Pro, but supports US LTE bands and is available in many markets. The biggest problem with the Redmi Pro for now, is that it can only be imported through Chinese retailers, since it is not launched outside of the country yet. That also means there won't be any official support available for the device. If it launches in whichever country you live in, there shouldn't be any doubt in opting for the smartphone, but that is largely uncertain for now. The review unit was supplied by Gearbest. If you would like to purchase the device, you can head here to purchase the smartphone which currently is priced at around $215 USD.

Image Credit: REUTERS/Gene Blevins Elon Musk is not one to let setbacks slow him down, even when setbacks involve the explosion of a rocket containing cargo precious to fellow tech billionaire Mark Zuckerberg. As of this week, SpaceX, where Musk is CEO, is back in the business of launching rockets. And Musk is pushing ahead on his outsize ambitions for the company. After 17 successful launches between 2012 and 2015, SpaceX initially planned to launch 20 rockets in 2016. Largely because of the aforementioned explosion — the company’s second rocket loss in two years — it managed only eight. On Twitter, Musk called the Sept. 1 incident “the most difficult and complex failure we have ever had.” But if last year ended on a sour note for SpaceX, 2017 is starting off with more promise. After spending months investigating and resolving the issues that caused the September explosion, the company launched a Falcon 9 on Jan. 14, deployed 10 satellites, and successfully re-docked the rocket booster at sea. The satellites are a portion of the 70 such units that SpaceX is putting into orbit for Iridium, which is upgrading its satellite network offering phone and Internet broadband service. The launch was doubly important for SpaceX, which has been quietly harboring its own Internet satellite plans. Musk wants to bring space broadband to the world — not just to the legions of Americans who are unhappy with their Internet providers, but to the 3 billion people around the world who have poor or no Internet access. The catch? That goal has long been a costly, not to mention risky, venture. Internet broadband by satellite has been a longtime dream for telecom companies, but early efforts faltered. About 20 years ago, Teledesic planned to launch 824 satellites backed by an investment from Bill Gates, but suspended the project in 2003. Early efforts by Iridium and Globalstar led to bankruptcies. More recent Internet satellite ventures like HughesNet and Exede have fared better, while others are trying to deliver on Teledesic’s early promise. OneWeb has raised money from Virgin Group, Qualcomm, Softbank and others to deploy 648 satellites aimed at bringing fast, cheap access to hard-to-reach places. Musk’s goal, however, aims to dwarf them all. In November, SpaceX filed an application with the Federal Communications Commission to launch 4,425 satellites into orbits between 690 and 825 miles above the Earth. “Once fully deployed, the SpaceX System will pass over virtually all parts of the Earth’s surface and therefore, in principle, have the ability to provide ubiquitous global service,” SpaceX said in its application. “Every point on the Earth’s surface will see, at all times, a SpaceX satellite.” To put this project’s ambitions into context, there are currently 4,256 satellites orbiting the planet. Only 1,419 of them are working. The rest are effectively space junk. So Musk wants to put three times as many satellites into the sky as there are in operation right now. SpaceX will first deploy 1,600 satellites to offer Internet access in the U.S., and the rest to expand coverage around the world. It’s not clear whether SpaceX will offer access directly or through other companies like Google, which in 2015 participated in a $1 billion investment in SpaceX to help it build satellites. Musk has said the Internet project will take more than five years and $10 billion to complete. Some calculate it could cost twice as much. Analysts once forecast that Google’s plans to build out fiber optics to U.S. cities could also cost $10 billion. Google (GOOG, +0.18%) wants to offer cheap access to support its ad-centric business, but has been scaling back its Fiber plans. Satellite Internet could offer a more cost-effective alternative. For SpaceX, satellite Internet could be highly profitable. A recent report in the Wall Street Journal cited company figures that projected revenue from the initiative would top $30 billion by 2025 — six times that of its rocket business — while the company’s operating profits could rise above $20 billion. That could offer Musk the capital he needs to push for SpaceX’s ultimate goal: a colony on Mars, complete with satellite-powered Internet access. In other words, setbacks aside, Musk is pushing as hard as ever to attain his big dreams. In the meantime, SpaceX is pushing to increase its rocket launches to 27 this year and 44 next year. So far, it has one of those launches completed. For now, building a wired colony on a planet 34 million miles away still seems more like science fiction than a practical goal. But to paraphrase an old saying, a journey of 34 million miles begins with a single rocket launch. This story originally appeared on Fortune.com.

Americans crowded polling stations Tuesday to vote in their historic election, with front-running Democrat Barack Obama seeking to become the first black US president and Republican rival John McCain battling for a comeback.

RICHARDS Copyright Getty Images Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next Concocting fake news can be a profitable venture. According to Cameron Harris, a story that took him 15 minutes to make up earned him $5,000 in profit, he told the New York Times.  Harris said his only expense was spending $5 on the domain name "Christian Times."  The fake story Harris wrote about came late in September when Republican Donald Trump began hinting that the upcoming election could be rigged. Harris' article claimed that Hillary Clinton ballots were found in a warehouse in Columbus, Ohio.  The New York Times reported that the story was read more than 6 million times. The website helped earn Harris a cool $22,000.  Harris' story was enough to prompt the Franklin County Board of Elections to investigate. The elections board found that the photo Harris used was actually from a news story used in England in 2015.  "The Franklin County Board of Elections immediately began a preliminary investigation to get to the bottom of this and push back on the validity of this article that appears to be absolutely fake," the elections board said in a statement.  Columbus TV station WCMH-TV said that its station was inundated by viewers demanding coverage on the fake story.  Although Harris said he voted for Trump, his intentions were financial instead of political. He told the New York Times that he would have smeared Trump had it been as lucrative.  But Harris said it will be tough to make money off fake news in the future. Google has stopped funding advertisements for fake news sites. Also, Facebook is putting in place measures to prevent the spread of fake news.  “I had a theory when I sat down to write it,” Harris, told the New York Times. “Given the severe distrust of the media among Trump supporters, anything that parroted Trump’s talking points people would click.

Commodity jobs in the so-called on-demand economy — such as driving for ridesharing companies like Uber and Lyft — are likely to be automated away in the near future and workers are right to be concerned, said Thumbtack CEO Marco Zappacosta. Thumbtack, which matches small-business professionals with customers who need jobs done, has a good vantage point when it comes to the current debate over jobs and automation. "Anxiety has been correlated with the fear of their job being automated away — humans are smart — if they sense that their livelihood might slip away, it is extremely anxiety-inducting" he told CNBC. In particular, he pointed to Uber drivers as one job that might not exist in a few years. Ridesharing companies and big auto manufacturers are working hard to figure out how to provide autonomous vehicles, something that could happen over the next three to ten years, he said. "It's going to happen, and that will have a much more dramatic impact on the industry than any law ever could," he said. Source: Thumbtack Thumbtack pro Coco Minot, a personal trainer for Massachusetts. The future of work in the U.S. will be non-routine jobs that cannot be automated in the near-term and those that cannot be shipped overseas, he said. These are the sorts of jobs listed on Thumbtack's marketplace, as well as jobs in things like healthcare and education, he said. "When it comes to fixing your plumbing or tutoring your kid in math or catering your wedding, there's no way around the fact that the pro needs to be there," he said. In terms of priorities for the next administration, Zappacosta would like so-called portable benefits, so that every American worker gets access to benefits such as healthcare regardless of how they're employed. The government should provide those benefits, not the platform companies, he said. He would also like to see the federal government streamline regulations to make it easier for small contractors to navigate the system. "Our pros tell us they are more burdened by regulation than by taxes," he said. Thumbtack faces competition from Amazon, Alphabet's Google and Angie's List, but its marketplace is far bigger than its competitors, he said. It's also more broad, offering everything from yoga instructors to plumbers for hire. "We think that's the only way to truly build a great brand and awareness among customers because the reality is you don't need a plumber or caterer that often, but in aggregate you need many of these folks every year," he said. Thumbtack claims more than 10 million users who use the platform to find workers, and says it sends the more than 250,000 professionals listed on its platform over $1 billion per year in earned income. It has raised $270 million in venture capital funding at a reported $1.3 billion valuation. show chapters Robots will take jobs, but not soon    Friday, 13 Jan 2017 | 1:55 PM ET | 00:39 Harriet TaylorCNBC Tech Reporter Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change AMZN --- Binge 'Walking Dead' a megahit, thanks in part to white-knuckled binge-watchers By: Marc Gilbert, senior producer, CNBC Walking Dead producer: The phenomenon is no accident    Walking Dead producer: The show isn’t about zombies    Terminator writer sounds alarm on AI    Walking Dead producer: VR makes me nauseous    To view this site, you need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser, and either the Flash Plugin or an HTML5-Video enabled browser.

A Qualcomm chip is smaller than a penny. Image: Qualcomm By Pete Pachal2017-01-19 01:27:33 UTC Analysis Qualcomm is in trouble. For most, those words probably mean next to nothing, but if you know much about the technology within your smartphone, it means a great deal. Qualcomm builds many of the key components of the world's smartphones — specifically, the modems and often the processors, too. It's also the dominant vendor in both categories. To smartphone users, the difference between a phone that uses a chip or modem from Qualcomm and some other brand is often measured in seconds — how long it takes to launch an app or call up a webpage, for instance. To the industry, it's measured in billions of dollars — the reward for making deals to get your technology into the hands of millions of people. And in the future, the difference could play a role in the 5G race.  SEE ALSO: The iPhone's remarkable 10-year history, in pictures Shady deals? For the last several years, Qualcomm has been particularly adept at making those deals, growing its market share even in the wake of public stumbles like the Snapdragon 810, a flagship chip that ended up prone to overheating. In particular, it's been the exclusive provider for modems on the iPhone since 2011 (at least until last year, when Apple began using Intel modems in some iPhone 7 models). An iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. Image: Mashable Now it looks like some of Qualcomm's deals may have been out of bounds. The Federal Trade Commission took the rather extreme step of suing Qualcomm over how it does business, and it's been very specific about it. In a nutshell, the FTC says Qualcomm is being a supreme dick about its patents, which allows the company to squeeze licensing fees from anyone it does business with. For a patent holder that's not entirely unexpected (or necessarily bad) except that Qualcomm's patents here are so fundamental to smartphone technology that they're considered standard-essentials patents — a special type that basically forces the patent holder to license them at a "reasonable rate." The FTC accuses Qualcomm of not doing that, but also that it went even further, basically forcing any smartphone maker to pay Qualcomm for phones that don't contain its modem tech, if they wanted to do business with Qualcomm at all. Not the first complaint Qualcomm's been accused of noncompetitive practices before, but they were from the South Korean and Chinese governments in Asia, whose interests happen to align with chip companies (like MediaTek and Samsung) based there. Not so this time. Qualcomm is a U.S. company, negating any claims of regional protectionism. "This is the third time they've had an antitrust suit," explains Tim Bajarin of Creative Strategies, a Silicon Valley market research firm. "There's no question that when you have these kind of suits, there has to be some kind of significant evidence or material that would force these antitrust lobbies to [act]." Naturally, any discussion of smartphone technology eventually drifts to Apple (call it Jobs' Law), and the company is pretty heavily involved in this. Allegedly, Qualcomm pressured Apple into using its modems in the iPhone from 2011 to 2016, effectively shutting out its competitors from working with the most influential smartphone maker in the world and hampering their development. (In that time Qualcomm's market share in mobile modems grew from 45% to 65%.) "Apple is the premium brand in smartphones," says Jan Dawson, a mobile industry analyst. "Every other brand is either not premium or a mixed bag of offerings. It's certainly more valuable as a relationship." Interesting tidbit: Those new Intel modems in the iPhone are apparently so much slower than Qualcomm's that Apple is throttling them so users have a consistent experience. Whether that's evidence in the FTC's favor or just bad engineering probably depends on whose side you're on. The Trump factor The bigger question is, will any of this matter under a Trump administration? Conventional wisdom says that a theoretically business-friendly Republican leadership won't be as excited to push the case forward, and the current FTC chair will step down on Feb. 10. However, Trump is said to be considering Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes as the replacement. Reyes hasn't been too kind to big tech companies in the past, so there's little reason to believe he would give Qualcomm a break here. (That is, if he ends up being Trump's pick.) "This is one of the very last actions of the outgoing FTC," Dawson says. "It's possible the case may not be pursued as aggressively as it would have. But remember, [Reyes] suggested going after Google. He probably won't give anybody a free pass." For its part, Qualcomm issued a defensive statement, essentially a non-denial denial that was very light on detail, apparently saving its point-by-point rebuttal for court. Considering the FTC filed its lawsuit in Apple's backyard of Northern California (as opposed to Qualcomm's home of SoCal), the witness testimony could get interesting. The 5G race If you've read this far, you may still be wondering how this affects you. Simple: 5G. Right now it's a future-tech buzzword, but in a year or two we'll start to hear about the first smartphones with 5G speeds. 5G promises smartphone connections faster than even today's wired internet, able to transfer gigabits per second (real-world LTE usually maxes out in the tens of megabits). 5G represents a new frontier for mobile internet players like Intel, MediaTek and others — especially since there are still billions (with a "b") of people who don't yet own a smartphone. It could be that Qualcomm, with its impressive patent collection and world-class team simply outplayed everybody in the age of LTE, and when 5G comes along it'll be more of the same. But if it's found to have stacked the deck in its favor and has to make changes, the 5G era could end up being a lot more competitive. That could get messy — modem performance could vary wildly between manufacturers and even individual models — but it could also give some innovative outliers the chance to shine. It all depends if the incoming FTC chair still thinks that's a future worth fighting for. We'll find out soon enough.

The suit says that the company favors Asian workers in its recruiting and hiring practices for product development and other technical roles, which resulted in hiring discrimination against non-Asian applicants. In a statement, Oracle Corp. on Wednesday called the suit “politically motivated, based on false allegations and wholly without merit.” The Labor Department said the lawsuit is the result of a review of Oracle’s equal employment opportunity practices at its headquarters in Redwood Shores, Calif.. According the suit, Oracle has refused to comply with the agency’s “routine requests” for employment data and records. “As a federal contractor, Oracle is prohibited from engaging in employment discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or national origin and is required to take affirmative action to ensure that equal employment opportunity is provided to applicants and employees in all aspects of employment,” the Labor Department said. Earlier this month, the Labor Department also sued Google, saying the company has refused to provide the department with employee compensation records and other information as part of an audit designed to ensure it isn’t discriminating against workers based on gender or race. Oracle, Google and other technology companies have made public commitments to improving gender and racial diversity in recent years. But change has been slow to come, and the companies continue to be dominated by white (and sometimes Asian) men, especially in technical and leadership positions.

 Snapchat hired a high-level State Department official to lead its global public policy Biz Carson Jan. 18, 2017, 8:06 PM 4,068 facebook linkedin twitter email print Jennifer Park Stout is Snap's new head of global public policy. LinkedIn Snap Inc. has hired Jennifer Park Stout, who is currently deputy chief of staff to the Secretary of State, to be its new head of global public policy. Stout's job change was noted on her LinkedIn. Snap confirmed to Business Insider that she will be joining the company.  The move comes as Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, looks to deepen its ties to Washington ahead of a hotly-anticipated initial public offering that could value its business at around $20 billion. Last week, the company said it had also recruited senior state department official, Rick Stengel, to be a senior adviser to the Venice, Calif.-based company.  Stout has spent most of her career in government, having started her career working as legislative aide for then-Senator Joseph Biden in 1998. She spent one year working for insurance company MetLife as its VP for International Government Affairs, before returning to work at the U.S. Department of State, most recently as its deputy chief of staff.  Now, Stout is going back to the private sector to lead Snap's global public policy initiatives. Ex-Googler Micah Shaffer will remain in his role as Snap's director of public policy, reporting to Stout. Stout's hire makes her the latest government official to join the startup world, and one of the few female executives at the company. Airbnb's head of global public policy, Chris Lehane, previously served as a close aide to Bill Clinton. Obama's campaign mastermind, David Plouffe, also recently joined the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative after a short stint leading policy at Uber.

You’ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You’re all set! Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it Chinese President Xi Jinping speaks during the World Economic Forum meeting. (Ruben Sprich/Reuters) By Editorial Board By Editorial Board January 18 Follow postopinions XI JINPING took a stab at seizing the mantle of global economic leadership on Tuesday, delivering a lengthy defense of free trade and globalization at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. To some extent, it worked: Many in the elite crowd of business leaders, government ministers and journalists seemed thrilled to hear the Chinese president, in his first appearance at the swishy forum, proclaim that there was “no point in blaming economic globalization for the world’s problems” — particularly as he spoke on a day when British Prime Minister Theresa May was outlining a “hard exit” from the European Union and European newspapers were quoting President-elect Donald Trump on his plans for punitive tariffs. Mr. Xi certainly was shrewd to position himself as the alternative to Mr. Trump, and the eager response to him was a demonstration of the vacuum of U.S. leadership the incoming president may soon create. But before China’s ruler is crowned the new champion “Davos man,” it ought to be pointed out that his regime is, in most respects, far less liberal or embracing of globalization than the Trump administration will be even if the worst fears of its critics come true. For example, Mr. Xi declared that “we must remain committed to developing global free trade and investment, promote trade and investment liberalization . . . and say no to protectionism.” Yet his own regime has sharply tightened the flows of capital and investment across China’s borders. Imagine a Trump administration placing controls on the transfer of more than $5 million out of the United States, as the Xi regime just did in China. Foreign companies that wish to invest in the country often still are forced to partner with local companies and hand over their technology. Major U.S. Internet companies, including Facebook and Twitter, remain locked out of the market. Inconveniently for Mr. Xi, the American Chamber of Commerce in China released a report on Wednesday showing that 81 percent of 462 surveyed companies said they felt less welcomed in the country than before, and a quarter were reducing their operations or planning to do so. “It is becoming apparent that the benefits of globalization are being taken for granted or even forgotten” by Beijing, said a statement by AmCham China Chairman William Zarit. That’s not to speak of the side of globalization conspicuously omitted by Mr. Xi, who carefully used the modifier “economic.” Since he took power in 2012, flows of information inside China as well as across its borders have been radically curtailed. Independent civil society has been virtually shut down, and critical journalists and academics silenced; even lawyers who defend them have been persecuted and imprisoned. While China barrages U.S. satellite viewers and newspaper readers with state-produced propaganda, the New York Times is banned in China, Google is censored, and critical journalists and academics are not allowed into the country. None of this justifies a mercantilist response from Mr. Trump; Mr. Xi was right in saying that “no one will emerge as a winner in a trade war.” But if the Chinese regime really wishes to assume global economic leadership — or, for that matter, avoid endless conflict with the new U.S. administration — it would do well to follow up its speeches with genuine liberalization.

To CNNMoney business culture gadgets future startups To CNNMoney Oracle latest tech firm sued by Department of Labor by Seth Fiegerman   @sfiegerman January 18, 2017: 4:03 PM ET Microsoft's Nadella: How Trump can work with Silicon Valley Oracle is the latest technology company to face scrutiny from the U.S. government over its hiring practices. The Department of Labor is suing Oracle (ORCL, Tech30) for allegedly paying white men more than other employees and discriminating against non-Asian job applicants when hiring for technical roles. The lawsuit stems from Oracle's role providing cloud computing software to federal agencies, totaling "hundreds of millions" in contracts, according to the Department of Labor. As a federal contractor, Oracle is obligated to show the government that its hiring doesn't discriminate based on race, religion, sexual orientation, gender and more. The legal complaint asks the court to order the cancellation of all of Oracle's federal contracts unless it prohibits discriminatory hiring practices and makes up for lost compensation and employment benefits to those affected. "The complaint is politically motivated, based on false allegations, and wholly without merit," Deborah Hellinger, a spokeswoman for Oracle, said in a statement provided to CNNMoney. "Oracle values diversity and inclusion, and is a responsible equal opportunity and affirmative action employer." Related: Trump sits down with top Silicon Valley execs Earlier this month, the Department of Labor filed a lawsuit against Google (GOOGL, Tech30), pressuring it to turn over compensation data on its employees. The agency also sued Palantir, a data software startup, in September for allegedly discriminating against Asian applicants. All three tech companies are federal contractors. Two of the three are overseen by executives close to the incoming Trump administration. Palantir cofounder Peter Thiel and Oracle co-CEO Safra Catz are both on Donald Trump's transition team. The series of government lawsuits comes as Silicon Valley is very publicly trying -- and often failing -- to improve its diversity. Annual transparency reports from many of the big companies reveal the tech industry remains largely white and male. The increased media attention may be influencing the Department of Labor as well. "They read the same stories that everyone else reads. It's something I'm sure they take note of," says D. Michael Hancock, a former Department of Labor official who now works as a lawyer at Cohen Milstein. "They probably said, 'Now that we're getting [employee] complaints, we should take a closer look.'

Elizabeth, Mrs. James Monroe, disliked making that customary first social call to officials’ womenfolk. So she didn’t. So these sweet ladies stuck it to her. They boycotted her events. Hell hath no fury like a Cabinet wife scorned. In 1776, Abigail Adams, the first feminist, urged hubby to “remember the ladies.” Understand, John was a little busy. With no Google, no spell check, no nothing, the guy was writing our Declaration of Independence. Sarah, Mrs. James Polk, forbade dancing and card playing. Mrs. Rutherford Hayes banned booze. Abraham Lincoln’s Mary held séances. Eliza taught husband Andrew Johnson how to spell (which doesn’t say much for a president, right?). In the 1900s, Mrs. William Howard Taft smoked cigarettes. Warren Harding’s missus was the first first lady to vote, first first lady to fly in an airplane, operate a movie camera, own a radio and — Meryl Streep, pay attention — first to invite movie stars to the White House. Also she had a little bad habit. She poisoned her husband. To Friday’s new president of the United States of America, commander in chief of the armed forces, leader of the free world, head man of the greatest country on God’s earth — may the force be with you.

Minority women are the fastest growing segment of entrepreneurs, yet recent studies have shown that businesses owned by women of color are less likely to be selected for funding from angel investors and other financial institutions. In addition to access to prize funding, PROSPECTUS will provide support in access to business education and professional networks. "The PROSPECTUS Accelerated Business Development Program, is another effort designed by Walker's Legacy that meets our central goal of providing the greatest number of opportunities and resources for women-of-color entrepreneurs to succeed." stated Natalie M. Cofield, Founder & CEO of Walker's Legacy. The PROSPECTUS program will utilize structured online learning, in-person cohort models and regional and national pitch competitions to aid aspiring and existing small businesses owned by women of color grow and expand. The program is in partnership with Wells Fargo and will include a final grand prize award of $5,000, as well as other in-kind prizes. Additional program partners include Google and Kiva Zip, among others. For more information on the PROSPECTUS Accelerated Business Development Program, please visit http://www.walkerslegacy.com or e-mail at info@walkerslegacy.com ### About Walker's Legacy: Founded in 2009, Walker's Legacy is a professional collective committed to the empowerment and support of women of color in business. Its dynamic programming promotes the career advancement, skill sets, and network of women in business and women entrepreneurs.

When supply is large and demand is low, prices are low. When supply is small and demand is high, prices are high. Your labor is a form of price. Tech management jobs are in small supply, which makes them hard to get. High wages mean high prices to the employer. There are fewer positions that have high costs to the employer simply because they do not like high expenses. If you want to be competitive in the job market for management in the tech industry, ask yourself the following three questions: 1. What Am I Actually Good at Doing? Are you really qualified for being a technology manager? Some people think that padding a resume is all that needs to be done. This is not true. Good technology managers are detail oriented, careful, and well informed. If you are not good at these things, reconsider becoming a technology manager. If you feel like you could practice these things, then get to work on it. You can check your mental qualifications against the Myers-Briggs type indicator. Dr. Dario Nardi of UCLA has compiled one of the best free brain tests online. Figure out what you are really good at doing by comparing with the career lists at this site. You will avoid disappointment for both you and your employer by doing so. 2. Who is My Target Market? What employers are greedily demanding people like you? Job seekers often overstate their own abilities to their interviewers. Make an honest appraisal of your own strengths and weaknesses. What kinds of businesses are hungrily looking for people like you? An entry level software engineer will do better working in Africa than in Silicon Valley. Why? Far less competition and a much lower cost of living. In order to find your ideal market, you have to be flexible. 3. What Are My Competitors Afraid to Do? This comes from the wisdom of Warren Buffett. If you do what all the other tech management job seekers are doing, you are all going to be grabbing for a small shrinking pie. What differentiates Average Joe from Steve Jobs is the level of innovation and courage that the two have. You have to be willing to strike out on your own to find a fresh pie that your competitors are missing. You can compile a list based on what your friends at school are pursuing, but you will find the most opportunities by doing the opposite. Tech management job seekers are usually pursuing high pay, indoors, easy living, fancy school, Silicon Valley, New York, Google, Apple, Microsoft, short commute, big city, USA, Europe, independent, remote work, no boss, civilian, great work environment, and kind peers. All of these traits have a ton of competition. If you want to find lots of easy tech management jobs, do the opposite virtues in your search. Things like low pay, outdoors, hard living, community college, Cairo, Delhi, Mom & Pop store, long commute, small city, international, Asia, Africa, dependent, corporate work, lots of bosses, military, terrible work environment, and evil peers. These unpopular traits when combined can give you a pick of great tech management jobs. The secret is to be the crazy person who is willing to try a few. No one succeeded by refusing to fail. We succeed by learning from our failures. Some of the best search engines for finding jobs quickly are Craigslist, Government Jobs, and LinkedIn. Use networking to improve your opportunities. You do not have to do all of the unpopular traits to find your dream career. But adding a few of the undesirable virtues to your job search will increase the probability that you get a tech management position. Things like VSAT technology have made more people interested in the tech management field. Applying the laws of economics to your job search will put you on the high road to success.  Edited by Alicia Young Author Info Lindsey Patterson Contributing Writer Click here to read full bio SHARE THIS ARTICLE Tweet Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Related Articles New FCC Head Approves $170M for Broadband, Job Creation By: Paula Bernier    1/27/2017 The FCC's first move under the new chairman was to approve $170 million in new federal funding to expand broadband connectivity to unserved rural area… Read More Rethinking Collaboration in the Next Generation Workplace By: Special Guest    1/26/2017 While today's applications truly are exciting, it's easy to overlook how important the workplace environment is for their success.

I look after the Entrepreneurs page, Alternative Finance and our Office Politics section. I also help out with the Forum, running our daily debate. I have a special interest in distributed ledger technology. Prior to working at City A.M., I ran a social enterprise.  Follow Harriet Related City Talk Invest Edinburgh Talk Global giant Shell helping innovators to harness air turbulence Quantum computers can solve some problems 100m faster than those we use today (Source: Getty) Harriet Green A new campaign appeared on crowdfunding platform Crowdfunder this week. Scottish energy firm Our Energy is raising £450,000 to set up an alternative gas and electricity provider. Fed up with Big Six high tariffs and just “lining shareholders’ pockets”, founders David Pike and Karen Snode decided to start a competitor, with plans to be operational by the end of the year. In addition to furnishing consumers with a new provider, Our Energy is also using the crowdfunding mechanism to create a new sort of business model. Customers will have voting rights and will be given an annual rebate worth 75 per cent of profits. As the company grows, shares will be transferred back to customers, rather than sold to, say, private equity firms or pension funds. Our Energy will offer a Green Tariff, and provide complete transparency of within-business pay. Of course, “democratising” business ownership (which is what this ostensibly is, albeit very similar to what Coop Energy offers) is what crowdfunding as a sector prides itself on – you get a good service and an investment. But innovating firms still have to operate within the current legal structures for companies. The question for anyone interested in brand new forms of ownership and organisational structures has to be around decentralisation and, ultimately, distributed models – where data and power are spread across networks. If crowdfunding is an early iteration of how digital technology helps distribute the potential to make money, what comes next? Distributed ledger technology (including blockchain) can be used to log ownership, transactions (very nearly in real-time) and execute smart contracts. Indeed, many claim the technology could replace the marketplace lending favoured by leading alternative lenders, where money is lent off the platform’s balance sheet, in order to keep supply and demand in equilibrium. A smart contract could, without a middleman – be that a bank or platform – guarantee a payment to a borrower, provided certain criteria are met. Or guarantee lending for the investor, based on exposure parameters. Having a go Meanwhile, there has already been a shambolic attempt to enable the evolution of a new form of company on the Ethereum blockchain – the Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO). It ended in tears last year (with $50m being nicked in a hack), yet despite unresolved security issues, those behind it were attempting something never before tried: to offer complete transparency, shareholder control and autonomous governance via a set of (smart) contracts between members. Crucially, the DAO was an attempt to create an organisation and enforce the ownership and governance of it without the backing of the state. It might have gone Pete Tong, but this is an important suggestion of a paradigm shift. Incorporation is a creature of statute. Setting up a company (and it’s pretty similar the developed world over) requires registration with Companies House, an executive agent of the government. Of course, our august system of company creation and legal enforcement is something to be proud of. After all, it underpins the capitalism that makes us increasingly prosperous. But what might new systems look like? Litmus test To take a guess, consider just one technology about to take off – one that will make everything we do much, much faster. Quantum computers have meant that those working with distributed ledger technology have already had to start thinking ahead of themselves. A quantum computer could break blockchains (by calculating private keys from public keys) in minutes, giving it access to information and money. A solution may be found in more sophisticated cryptography, but nevertheless, a new report out late last year from the Global Risk Institute estimates that 50 per cent of public key cryptography will be broken by 2031. This is relevant because it tells us how fast things can change in the digital era. Imagine setting up an organisation by logging it on a distributed database, tapping into a borderless legal system, and attracting investors, management and shareholders (or the equivalent of) from all over the world. While we will need new legal forms and structures, there could well be familiar models too: global friendly societies, for example. Jeremy Hilton, a senior vice president at D-Wave, the first firm in the world to sell quantum computers, says we have only just started learning about what quantum computing can do for business. “There is no question that this technology will continue to change how businesses run – be that more effective automation processes, software that adapts more quickly, or applications we haven’t even dreamed of yet.” A Google study found that these computers will be 100m times faster for certain problems than those we use today. “Thousands of new companies will form as this industry develops,” says Hilton. But for the time being, firms like Our Energy, and digital-only bank Tandem, which has an invite-only shareholder scheme (anyone able to help build the bank automatically gets shares and becomes a co-founder), should be applauded and supported. They might seem zany at the moment, just as crowdfunding is still the preserve of the relative few, but it is only through trial and error that we are given a glimpse of the future.

The one with all of your baking sheets? It turns out that this particular drawer isn't meant for storage, but for keeping hot food hot while you wrap up cooking dinner. Photo by Grant C. Maybe you knew this already, but it's new information to me, and it's blowing my mind. Keep in mind that the drawer is only meant to keep already cooked food warm, not cook cold food. According to Real Simple, you may see a little sticker with a safety message: The warming drawer is designed to keep hot foods at serving temperature. Always start with hot food. Cold or room-temperature foods cannot be heated, warmed, or cooked in the warming drawer. Bacteria will grow very rapidly in food that is between 40 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit [4C and 60C]. Of course, no one is saying you can't keep storing pans in there, but it's nice to know you have a warming drawer at your disposal. Keep in mind that this doesn't apply to all ovens, so be sure to check your manual to be sure, or Google the model number to find the manual online and check.

Trump will be inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States of the America, and a dispiriting and dangerous new era will begin. Two and a half months on from his shock election victory there is still little agreement on what the age of Trump means and how it came about. In keeping with the divisiveness and disinformation that defines the Trump team's modus operandi, there is still no received wisdom or mainstream view on how Trump will govern. Related articles Donald Trump: The (bad for) business president Trump goes to Paris? Climate scepticism on the ticket, as 'Dangerous Donald' picks Mike Pence for Vice President Will President Trump cancel the Paris Agreement celebrations? To his many critics he remains a racist, sexist, vulgarian; a conflicted and corruptible figure pursuing a dangerous economic, military, and environmental agenda - an agenda defined by thin-skinned narcissism, grift, and ideological extremism, and masked by a shameless propensity to lie and mislead. To his supporters and post-election apologists he is a refreshingly direct, politically incorrect counter-punch to the failed economic and identity politics of the Obama era; a patriot who is willing to prioritise US economic interests, tackle the worst excesses of globalisation, and push back against the liberal elite's obsession with esoteric concepts such as environmentalism and equality. These two tribes have little common ground, but there appears to be one lens for viewing the Trump Presidency that both supporters and opponents are prepared to share: namely, the idea that he will be the 'Business President'. Across the political spectrum Trump is being described as the 'President CEO', the 'dealmaker in chief', a 'pragmatic businessman', and a leader who, in the words of Michael Gove's obsequious profile, 'intends to govern by spreadsheet'. Inevitably, there is still huge disagreement as to what this characterisation means. Fans of Trumpism believe having a businessman in the Oval Office will deliver the efficiency and hard-edged negotiating acumen the US needs, while critics are happy to see Trump associated with the worst excesses of the CEO class: the opaque finances, the hostility towards our shared environment, the conspicuous consumption, and the hypocritical willingness to engage in a form of patriotism-wash, lamenting trade imbalances and low wages, while importing Chinese-made goods and paying low wages. Trump himself is, of course, delighted with the image of president as corporate titan, knowing full well that it plays into the Master of the Universe persona and jobs promises that delivered him the White House, while also allowing him to trash critics of his commercial skills as jealous haterz. However, as with so much of Trump's agenda, it is vitally important this narrative is challenged, not only because running a global superpower is very different from running a mid-sized real estate firm and reality TV show, but also because the new President embodies a particular and narrow type of business mentality - and it is a mentality that is increasingly alien to the world's most successful businesses and our understanding of how a prosperous and resilient modern 21st century economy operates. Trump's decades of musings on the nature of business would not have been out of place in the 19th century, let alone the 20th. His is a corporate world where tax transparency is for the stupid, where deals typically result in one side winning and the other getting 'killed', where marketing and spin dominates all, where regulations kill jobs, and, as he revealed to Michael Gove this week, where standards designed to protect our shared habitat are 'environmental tricks' intended to stop his 'beautiful' project getting built. His background in real estate makes him a literal embodiment of rentier capitalism. His cabinet of billionaires is of a similar ilk with much of their trumpeted business experience having been built up in the fields of Wall Street financial engineering, extractive industries, and the murky corridors of energy lobbyists. Theirs is a milieu where regulation is invariably red tape, success is measured in quarterly results and not much else, and government is almost always an intrusion, even when it is on hand to mop up the oil spill or clean up the financial crash. It is also a world where climate risks are open to debate, clean energy is often unproven, and environmental safeguards are a socialist plot.    Donald Trump can position himself as the 'Business President' if he wants, but if he is not to do untold damage to the entrepreneurial constituency he professes to represent it needs to be understood that 'business' is not a homogenous entity. For decades (and arguably for much longer than that) there has been a tension between the idea of business as a mechanism for generating wealth for a narrow group of beneficiaries and as an engine for delivering progress for the society in which it operates. Trump appears to be firmly entrenched in the first tradition, unless you are willing to give unreasonable weight to a controversial charitable trust with a penchant for portraits of its perma-tanned founder. The tension between these two schools of thought is particularly pronounced when businesses engage with environmental issues. Businesses and investors that regard their mission as the extraction of the maximum returns in the shortest possible time inevitably have scant regard for issues such as sustainability and long-term risk, hence the willingness to countenance all kinds of misinformation and evidence-lite conspiracy theories to justify the high risks that come with sub-prime assets or 'drill baby drill' energy projects. Those firms with a wider, purpose-driven approach and a recognition of their position as engines of global development are far more likely to respond to existential environmental risks and understand the importance of co-operation with governments and commercial rivals alike in pursuing shared interests. Trump's victory is a victory for the dog-eat-dog, externality-offloading, polluting world of corporate short termism. But as with so much of the rest of his agenda it flies in the face of long-term trends. The last decade or so has seen the idea of sustainable development and green business models secure an ascendancy its cheerleaders never dreamed would come so soon. This dominance has come as the evidence has stacked up to show that sustainable business models, clean technologies, and ambitious environmental goals help drive commercial success. Consequently, the support for the Paris Agreement and the UN's Sustainable Development Goals from many of the world's largest businesses has been overwhelming. The biggest story in the energy sector in recent years has been the viability of clean energy technologies and the headwinds faced by a coal industry Trump will simply not be able to save. The world's most successful and popular business leaders are increasingly to be found not in the Trump clique, but amongst the innovative entrepreneurs working to deliver a sustainable, zero carbon economy. The Davos Summit has attracted plenty of snark this week - much of it justified - as commentators have lined up to observe the disconnect between this global corporate elite and the populist dominance of Trump and Putin. But many of the CEOs present continue to represent companies that are hugely popular, if not populist. Theirs are often the businesses that are delivering many of the jobs Trump seeks to take credit for and investing in the technologies that will determine whether or not our economy will cope with the climate risks that come with a century defined to date by 16 of the 17 hottest years on record. They are far from perfect, and some of them are still too keen to regard marketing greenwash as transformational programmes. But they have a vision for the 21st century that is diametrically opposed to that promised by President Trump - a vision based on clean tech innovation, climate resilience, and rising prosperity for all. One of the most informative charts shared at Davos shows the top 10 companies by market capitalisation last year compared to the top 10 in 2006. A decade ago this list was dominated by energy companies and banks, now it is technology firms that are to the fore, each of them replete with ambitious and long term environmental strategies. Apple tops the list, followed by Google parent Alphabet, Microsoft, and Berkshire Hathaway. Exxon Mobil comes next, but then it is back to companies with a serious interest in the low carbon transition, including Amazon, Facebook, Johnson & Johnson, and General Electric. These are the world's 10 biggest corporate giants https://t.co/JYdYZVeh5d #wef17 pic.twitter.com/m9iE4VvIaZ — World Economic Forum (@wef) January 17, 2017 As an essential recent article from US environmental commentator Alex Steffen argues this low carbon transition and the carbon bubble it is likely to result in as clean technologies mature and fossil fuels are sidelined is the critical factor in understanding a Trump cabinet "custom built to protect carbon industry investors". Trump's administration of high carbon interests and his cosying up to Putin represents a desperate (and hopefully last-ditch) attempt to keep the carbon bubble inflated. The primary goal of the many progressive businesses and investors who have so little in common with Trump is the safe deflation of that bubble and the successful transition to a sustainable, prosperous, and resilient global economy. Trump could yet wreak untold damage to the global climate change and environmental agenda, but he will not do so as the uncontested emissary of business, no matter how hard he tries to occupy that role. Green and progressive firms need to fight the idea that he is their representative every step of the way, just as they need to now redouble their efforts to compensate for the damage his pollutocrat administration is planning. They will be wary of doing so, knowing full well a single petulant tweet can knock billions off their valuations. But when Trump says he is torching environmental regulations or axing climate funds to aid US businesses, many of those firms will need to find the nerve to say the President is not acting for them. He may be the first 'Business President', but he is likely to be very bad for the business community.
