What was our most favorite joke this year? Honestly, we almost forgot about April 1st until Google started rolling out crazy announcements over at The Keyword, it’s official company blog. We’re still reeling from the laughter because it seemed the search giant really prepared for the weekend. Google wasn’t content with one announcement. It did unveil a number of new products and services we were supposed to enjoy. If you’re one of those fooled by at least one joke, you’re not alone. We almost believed the Google Gnome because well, it is believable and it is something that we need. Smart speaker for the yard? Why not. We’re listing below some of the jokes Google pulled on the public last April 1. Just in case some of you really believed or still have have no idea about the pranks, read on. Google Gnome The Google Home now has a brother. It’s one smart aleck perhaps even smarter that its sibling. The Gnome is the outdoor counterpart that helps the whole family to do many things outside the home. It’s exclusive to what you can do in the yard so don’t dare make other requests because it will remind you how forgetful you are. Say “Ok Gnome” and ask about the weather, turn on-off your water hose, or search for just about anything related to your garden. You can ask Gnome to play music but make sure you specify the song, genre, or artist. If you let Gnome decide, it will only play hard rock music as it’s favorite. More about the Gnome HERE. Chromebook Accessories Chromebooks are a dime a dozen since the product line was introduced by Google back in year 2012. Its been almost five years and we know it won’t go anytime soon unlike what happened to the Nexus brand. This Chromebook still has many potentials althrough there is a slight threat from the Pixel. More OEMs are encouraged to release Chromebooks especially now that Chrome OS can run Android apps already. Google showed off three new accessories for the Chromebook. We need at least one. There’s the Chromebook Groupie Stick, Chromebook Cardboard, and the Chromebook Workout Armband. Each one is a genius piece of art. Rest assured that Google spent time doing market analysis and research to determine what mobile accessories people are really looking for. Need to fit the whole gang into a selfie? Get the Groupie Stick. To make that Chromebook of yours more useful and immersive than ever is the Cardboaord while the Workout Armband is for the fitness enthusiast. Word Lens: Heptapod B Google Translate works best with the Word Lens feature. It’s made even better with the additional language that not can decipher circular logograms. The Heptapod B is the 32nd languge that can be interpreted by Google Translate to several other languages like Arabic, French, Spanish, Urdu, Russian, Japanese, Chinese, Danish, and English. Google for Pets Google for Pets is something the animal lovers have been waiting for since time immemorial. Our furry-friends need not just TLC from the pet owners but also the right information courtesy of Google. Now, Google caters to them in many ways most of us have probably thought of already. We bet you’ve imagined seeing that “I’m Feeling Meow” or “I’m Feeling Woof”. You see, Google hasn’t been always pet-friendly but it is now with a single press of your pet’s paw. Watch Video Google Bubble Wrap Keyboard Who doesn’t want this Bubble Wrap Keyboard from Japan? April Fool’s Joke or not, we know a few who will love this special keyboard. Watch Video Ms. Pac-Maps Check out Google Maps for Android and desktop (also in iOs) until April 4 and see Ms. Pac-Maps explore the world. This is based on the Pac-Man in Google Maps released back in 2015. Haptic Helpers Virtual is taken to a whole different level with Haptic Helpers. This feature lets you experience more unique experiences with simple tools you use everyday. You will never get bored at home with such techie helpers. Google Wind The Dutch know that the weather can be controlled because climate change isn’t real. Google Wind allows you to control a network of windmills in the Netherlands only. When you think it’s about to rain, summon the clouds to be dispersed. Waze to Mars Google-owned Waze definitely knows how to be of service of the earthlings. Last April 1, you could check out maps to Mars. Help the US, Italy, and Russian to map out Mars. It’s about time we get into this research and help. After all, we’re not alone in the universe and Mars is where we’ll live next. Google Cloud Platform in Mars Ah yes, Google is expanding to Mars. We’re with them in advancing the cloud platform game. Head on to Ziggy Stardust and explore the first interplanetary data center. We’ll be there when it opens next year. The Google Planets team has been busy working on the new headquarters because the world is simply not enough.

Schedule a demo today.  You have an application to slide into production on some release cadence. You’ve split it up into a number of services, perhaps. Are all the services get deployed together? Tricky. You could have them in one repo (directory separation, directed graph or recursive build system) and take advantage of atomic commits, but you’ll also ordinarily have a larger checkout and a larger amount of data exchanged with each pull versus the single service you’re working on. Google has a single repo for 25K developers. In that, there are many hundreds of separately buildable/deployable things. Each of those has its own release cadence. Some go into prod with every commit (Continuous Deployment style). Others have daily, weekly, or monthly cadences. It is all made sane by their expanding and contracting mono repo configuration and their Blaze (Bazel to you and me) build system which evolved with it. What seems wasteful is an app/service with certain release cadence being the product of two or more repositories — at least, it does where the product of those two repos had no other dependant apps. Git Loves Microservices (or) the Push/Pull Bottleneck In the microservices era, it makes sense to have one repo per microservice — at least, it does if they are separately deployable (the point of microservices). Being in a separate repo, they are by default separately buildable, of course. Being in a separate repo, they manage to avoid a push/pull bottleneck that comes with default Git usage. Perforce’s GitFusion side-install didn’t have that bottleneck, but the vast majority of Git teams are not using that. When Git gets past the push/pull bottleneck, then we maybe are able to step back from the one repo per microsoervice world that we are in now and see team VCS use evolve in ways closer to Google’s. Incidentally, if Google is not competing with your business idea (they won’t balkanize their ad revenue), count your lucky stars as their developer throughput is better than yours and they’d change your business and rules of engagement from afar. They will learn your domain/vertical faster than you can learn their developer efficiency. Oh, Buzz and GooglePlus notwithstanding. Twitter Conversation With Sam Newman Sam Newman paraphrased a Twitter conversation earlier this week in a Storify thingamy called “in which I discuss mono repos.” A correction from me — you can do a mono repo for even large teams without Buck/Bazel (Blaze) — Maven, Gradle and other recursive build systems are fine choices, too (in theory). We also discussed lockstep upgrades (which I like in a mono repo), and lockstep releases, which is at least entangled in this blog entry. Why Focus on Buildable/Deployables? Ok, so a modular build is a good thing if it allows you to choose to build one module only (or a subset of modules). At least if that allows elapsed time to be saved on the build. It is also good if the build technology itself can determine a elapsed time saving on the build (versus the full build). Maven (and similar) allows a modular build structure. You can cd into one of the sub modules, and build from there (and do naughty things like -DskipTests). That is an effective way of shortening elapsed build times. Jason van Zyl (Mr. Maven) made a Smart Builder that does some deterministic quickening of build, but I believe the competing Gradle wins for speed. Buck and Bazel (both in the image of Blaze) are directed graph build systems. There’s still intermediate buildable things, that it can build or skip the building of (on each build invocation). Those are modules too, even if you’re less aware of them. You always build from root with directed graph build technologies, and the cd to sub-module thing of Maven/Gradle doesn’t apply. Anyway, each module is a buildable thing, but the dev team has no intention of ever deploying a module on its own. Each module could be a Jar, and only a collection of those jars (say a WAR file) makes sense to deploy. Thus, the number of repositories determination is for things that are buildable and deployable.

Toshiba has reportedly completed the first round of bidding for its prized memory chip business, seen as key for the cash-strapped company to turn itself around. Some 10 foreign companies and funds, including Google and Amazon, tendered bids, the mass-circulation Yomiuri Shimbun said, quoting unnamed sources. The two US tech giants are expected to use Toshiba's memory chips for their cloud services, the daily said. Taiwan's Hon Hai, which acquired Japanese electronics maker Sharp last year, has apparently bid more than 2 trillion yen ($18 billion), the daily said. Immediate confirmation of the report was not available. Toshiba shares jumped more than five percent on Friday after local media reported that bidders included Apple, US private-equity firm Silver Lake Partners and American chipmaker Broadcom. Toshiba is expected to negotiate with individual candidates this month. Local media said any foreign buyer would need to pass a Japanese government review, given concerns about security around systems already using Toshiba's memory chips. Toshiba is the world's number two supplier of memory chips for smartphones and computers, behind South Korea's Samsung, and the business accounted for about a quarter of its 5.67 trillion yen in revenue last fiscal year. The news report came after angry investors lambasted Toshiba executives at a shareholders meeting over its warning that annual losses could balloon to more than $9.0 billion. The red ink is largely tied to huge cost overruns and construction delays at its US nuclear power unit Westinghouse Electric, which filed for bankruptcy protection late March.   0 0 Google, Amazon eye Toshiba's chip unit: report was posted in business of Geo TV - https://www.geo.tv on April 03, 2017 and was last updated on April 03, 2017.

Home Politics Entertainment Sports News Business Health Forum Post Free Ads Google’s U.K. Unit Reveals Tax Charge And Jump In Profits Filed in IT and Science by Cooljoe on April 3, 2017 • 0 Comments U.K. subsidiary of Alphabet Inc.’s Google turned a profit, before taxes, of 148.2 million pounds for the year ending June 30 2016, an increase of 15 percent compared with the previous 18-month period. Google’s U.K. business is to pay 25 million pounds ($31.4 million) in U.K. corporation tax, according to its latest results, a year after the company was ordered to hand over 130 million pounds in back taxes to the government. The U.K. subsidiary of Alphabet Inc.’s Google turned a profit, before taxes, of 148.2 million pounds for the year ending June 30 2016, an increase of 15 percent compared with the previous 18-month period. Revenue fell 12 percent to 1 billion pounds, according to Google U.K. Limited’s the annual report made public Friday. In January last year, Google’s tax settlement with U.K. authorities set off a backlash as opposition politicians questioned the government’s handling of the case and whether the search giant was paying enough. A U.K. parliamentary committee the following month accused Google of being “disingenuous” in regards to its reposes in how it handles international tax rules. “As an international business, we pay the majority of our taxes in our home country, as well as all the taxes due in the U.K.” said a Google spokesperson Friday in an emailed statement. “We have recently announced significant new investment in the U.K., including new offices in Kings Cross for 7,000 staff.” Google’s U.K. tax charge equates to 17.9 percent of Google U.K. Limited’s profit, less than U.K.’s corporate tax rate is currently 20 percent. Google shifted more than 10.7 billion euros ($11.8 billion) in international revenue to a Bermuda mailbox in 2014 through a series of tax structures known as a “Double Irish” and a “Dutch sandwich,” the most recent year for which figures are available. Doing so saved Alphabet some $2.4 billion in worldwide taxes that year, regulatory filings show. At Google U.K. Limited, total staff costs dropped to 541.2 million pounds, down 12 percent from 616.8 million pounds the previous 18-month period. While pay decreased, the amount of staff grew by 26 percent to 2,943. On average, each Google U.K. Limited employee received an annual salary of 183,897 pounds.

But not everyone in the industry agrees about what they’ll find inside. Probes in Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Ireland, and Austria continue to investigate rate parity, or contract clauses that stop operators from offering discounts on their brand.com websites. Here are a few updates: Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority (formerly the Office of Fair Trading) is due to announce its decision on hotel rate parity practices. Its earlier ruling had been partly overruled by a tribunal. On 2 April, the German Federal Cartel Office (the “FCO” or “Bundeskartellamt”) sent a cease-and-desist letter to Booking.com over its rate parity clauses. UPDATE: 7amET Booking.com makes changes to rate parity clauses in Europe The move followed its parallel proceedings against its smaller competitor HRS that were upheld by a higher court in January. HRS deleted rate parity clauses from its contracts last year. Proceedings against Expedia continue. In France, Accor and other hotel owners are participating in discussions among Booking.com (owned by Priceline Group), hotel unions, and the French Competition authority to establish more balance between the OTAs and hoteliers. In December, Booking.com partly removed some of its rate parity clauses, enabling hotels to offer different rates for their rooms to other OTAs. In January, France’s competition authority tested this solution to see if consumers were still, in its view, being harmed. Its verdict is expected soon. The European Commission said that a settlement with key countries like France will be made valid for all of the Continent. Finally, authorities in Sweden, France and Italy have this week also united to push Booking.com into making some changes. Après la parité, le déluge With or without rate parity, hotels are under tremendous pressure in Europe because OTAs and metasearch websites drive 70% of bookings, on average — significantly higher than the 35% to 50% range said to be typical in the United States. Guilain Denisselle, an expert who has written about the rate parity debate for Tendance Hotellerie, told Tnooz that even if regulators curtail or stop rate parity, hotels still face a tough market: “Many hotels will die. The estimation in France is that 3,000 to 4000 hotels will die out of the 18,000 actual hotels: too small, too old, not enough revenue, etc… The hotels that can win are the ones that already understand the concept of rate integrity, that do not discount too much, that invest a lot in their product every year, and that talk to their customers and get their engagement.” Some small OTAs also doubt that rate parity will level the playing field. Uwe Frers, owner of Berlin-based OTA Escapio, explained it this way: “Sometimes Escapio gets a rate for a hotel that is lower than what is available on Booking.com. When that happens, within about six hours, Booking.com calls the hotel demanding parity. Given that Booking.com has 50% market share in Germany, hotels listen and match the rate. That makes it harder for us to compete on price.” Frers said that he hopes that the European Commission ends rate parity because the practice is wrong. But he is skeptical that things will change for small OTAs as long as Booking.com has such enormous market power. Expedia and Booking.com in trouble? A counter-argument to the gloom-and-doom comes from Dorian Harris, the owner of small travel website Skoosh and a prime instigator of the British investigation of rate parity. In Harris’s view, Expedia and Booking.com — two of the largest players in Europe, along with HRS — have huge distribution costs. Paid search is expensive: Expedia’s and Booking’s parent companies buy 5% of all of Google’s AdWords. Last year, Expedia Inc. alone spent $2.4 billion on marketing across its portfolio. The key message of these Google ads is the “best rate guarantee,” the consumer-facing equivalent of hotel rate parity. Without rate parity, these sites won’t be able to make the best rate guarantees a plausible part of their pitch to consumers. That will presumably weaken click-through. Harris said: “Post-parity one of them could cut down on their Google advertising but, if it did, it will immediately lose market share to the other one and to upcoming competitors in this fickle market. Their shareholders wouldn’t be impressed. Worse still, they have big affiliate costs, such as partnerships with airlines. These partnerships will break down if Booking.com, for example, started discounting to its direct partners, thereby going into competition with its commercial partners.” Metasearch may be hampered, too Harris is also skeptical that metasearch will be able to thrive at the expense of hotels and smaller OTAs. He said: “Trivago also has huge distribution costs in the form of TV advertising. It would only take a new metasearch site to come into the market with lower distribution costs than Trivago, and to offer OTA partners and hotels lower commissions in return for lower advertising prices. Trivago would also have to cut back on its advertising spend to compete.” 2 things that may happen after rate parity How will hotels and OTAs of all sizes respond to a world where rate parity is restricted in Europe? We interviewed several experts, and a consensus formed around the following likely trends: 1. OTAs would push for more “Most Favored Nation” (MFN) status with more regional hotel chains Robert Cole, founder of Milwaukee-based hospitality and destination consultancy RockCheetah, said: “You get rid of rate parity and the intermediaries will have greater leverage to start talking about MFN clauses with major hotel brands. An OTA may say that, it wants to make sure its, say, 20% discount isn’t exceeded by anybody else.” MFN is a distribution agreement that is separate from rate parity. To explain how it works, here’s a made-up example. Say that Accor is better at negotiating with Booking.com than Starwood. Say that Accor haggles so that it only has to pay 15% in commissions to the OTA, while Starwood agrees to pay 19% — all other things being equal. Booking.com may then go to Accor and require MFN status, meaning that the hotel chain cannot distribute its inventory at a lower percentage discount to its OTA rival Expedia. Flo Lugli, of the New York-based hotel consultancy Navesink Advisory Group, explained: “OTAs could insist on specific agreement around MFN on any rates that are distributed to other third parties, in return for perhaps lower margins, a marketing fund concession, or other value that would be exchanged.” Accor, assuming again that it is a sharp negotiator, could insist on better marketing terms in exchange for MFN status. For example, it might — we could imagine — require higher placement for its hotels in search. To use our example again, say that Accor gives three percentage points greater discounts to Expedia, then Expedia could afford to sacrifice a point or two by undercutting Booking.com’s price while still making the same margin as its competitor. MFN status might prevent that. 2. TripAdvisor could enjoy a stronger poker hand Frers believes that the collapse of rate parity in Europe could give TripAdvisor the lure it needs to enlist hotels in its alternative distribution channel, TripConnect. Harris explained the underlying context this way: “The essential characteristic of the hotel industry, and one which separates it from most others, in that the majority of people who stay in hotels only ever stay there once. The obvious advantage goes to the OTA which can split the cost of marketing across hundreds or thousands of hotels.” Even if rate parity falls — and hotels can start to charge less on their own sites than they offer via OTAs, they still face a competitive disadvantage. Consumers prefer to shop in an aggregator model, because they’re not brand loyal to the typical hotel, on average. Enter, TripAdvisor. Its platform offers direct bookings, where hotels get the information on the customer, plus lower commissions than what OTAs charge. TripAdvisor also offers a presence on the most visited travel website in the world and, via Instant Booking, a mobile optimized booking experience superior to most hotels’ own websites. The upshot: TripAdvisor might eat Booking.com’s lunch. Other large hotel brands might feel empowered by the end of rate parity. Said Lugli: “Many hotels and brands that know how to manage their rates and inventory may like to see rate parity go away, given some of the restrictions they operate under, especially for niche channels and short term promos.” FYI: In the US, courts have repeatedly deemed hotel rate parity agreements to be legal, such as in a prominent case last year involving Marriott, Expedia, and Priceline. 3. Greater complexity of offers Priceline Group’s acquisition of Rocketmiles offered a hint of how OTAs might fight in the future. Rocketmiles incentivizes hotel bookings through mileage bonuses with more than two dozen airlines. By competing on a new-style of package price that includes mileage rewards, an OTA avoids rate parity issues. Moe Ibrahim, CEO of the OTA Journeyful, said: “OTAS could switch to tours and activities and other lead-generation package products. This way the hotel rooms, like air tickets, can just be lumped into a package price where naked pricing is never exposed. The OTAs can make money from exclusive deals or other high margin products.” Cole said he could envision other types of creative loyalty schemes, like 5% cash back.

In reality, the OTAs are approaching a global duopoly, and despite regulatory setbacks they will continue to exert their oligopolistic power. However, I do not believe that a promo code system can effectively substitute for a rewards platform. Here are several factors that should be considered: * OTA Acceptance: 5% Rewards = Accepted industry practice due to chain hotel loyalty program operations; 5% promo code = subject to OTA retaliation eventually * Costs incurred: 5% Rewards = Only guests who enroll into your hotel marketing & redeem; 5% promo code = most direct booking guests * Win business traveler market share: 5% Rewards = Yes; 5% promo code = No (many OTAs have rewards programs that allow guests to earn on business trips) * Guest Psyche: 5% Rewards = Recognized & appreciated; 5% promo code = ‘Part of the deal’ * Market Share: 5% Rewards = no impact; 5% promo code = Lowers market share * Hotel Prestige: 5% Rewards = Enhances brand value; 5% promo code = Cheapens brand A hotel doesn’t need expensive systems or technology to accomplish a guest financial rewards platform. Instead, partner with someone that has a turnkey platform with has a sizable hotel network, does not require system integration, does not have upfront or fixed costs, and that has a no-risk agreement. Reply 2 years ago   Patrick Landman A lot is being said, but in reality nothing changes. From a hotel perspective it all comes down to doing your job well in terms of marketing and distribution. An independent hotel if it delivers a uníque experience and great guest service can easily shine. And in combination with the correct strategy and segmentation it can still drive 40% or even much more direct sales and keep its distribution costs under control. The big channels keep competing which keeps the pressure on them. New OTAs and travel websites are being launched to continue the status quo. The main challenge for hoteliers is to be educated in the technical side of the business to achieve healthy results. We have been at this for quite some years and manage a portfolio of 35 hotels. It’s hard work yes. But it is certainly doable. The hotels also have to start doing the same as the OTA. I. e.a 5% cashback program Cann be easily set-up with a promo code system. No expenaive technology or systems are required for this. Work with your online marketing agency and read up on best practices to find out how to battle for the best results … Reply 2 years ago   James Gancos If non-chain hotels would like to offer 5% cash back as a reward for their direct booking/loyal guests, they can today through the Universal Points program. They don’t need to break rate parity and can also compete better with the chains for the business traveler. Join our network of 185+ hotels in 35 countries today.

Home News Companies Mobile Gadgets Opinion Cyber Security Multimedia Fin24 TechNews Google changes ad policies to end YouTube crisis 2017-04-03 06:47 - Bloomberg: Mark Bergen Post a comment 0 share: YouTube. (Duncan Alfreds, Fin24) RELATED ARTICLES YouTube hate videos haunt advertisers on Google Youtube TV service to compete with US cable YouTube's Wojcicki needs to make her business a TV star San Francisco - Two weeks into a YouTube advertising boycott over hateful videos, Google is taking more steps to curb a crisis that escalated further than the company anticipated. Alphabet Inc.'s main division is introducing a new system that lets outside firms verify ad quality standards on its video service, while expanding its definitions of offensive content.  A slew of major marketers halted spending on YouTube and Google's digital ad network after ads were highlighted running alongside videos promoting hate, violence and racism. READ: YouTube hate videos haunt advertisers on Google Google's initial response, a promise of new controls for marketers, failed to stymie the boycott. The crisis ignited a simmering debate in digital advertising over quality assurance, or "brand safety," standards online.  Google has since improved its ability to flag offending videos and immediately disable ads, Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler told Bloomberg News in a recent interview. Johnson & Johnson, one of largest advertisers to pull spending, said it is reversing its position in most major markets. Since the boycott began, Google has allocated more of its artificial intelligence tools to deciphering YouTube's enormous video library. The company is a pioneer in the field and has used machine learning, a powerful type of AI, to improve many of its products and services, including video recommendation on YouTube and ad-serving. Automatically classifying entire videos, then flagging and filtering content is a more difficult, expensive research endeavor - one that Google hasn't focused on much, until now. "We switched to a completely new generation of our latest and greatest machine-learning models," said Schindler. "We had not deployed it to this problem, because it was a tiny, tiny problem. We have limited resources."  In talks with big advertising clients, Google discovered the toxic YouTube videos flagged in recent media reports represented about one one-thousandth of a percent of total ads shown, Schindler said.  Still, with YouTube's size, that can add up quickly. And the attention on the issue coincided with mounting industry pressure on Google, the world's largest digital ad-seller, for more rigid measurement standards. A frequent demand has been for Google to let other companies verify standards on YouTube. Google is allowing this now, creating a "brand safety" reporting channel that lets YouTube ads be monitored by external partners like comScore Inc. and Integral Ad Science Inc., according to a company spokeswoman.  READ: Youtube TV service to compete with US cable Google has made quick progress on its own, he said. Using the new machine-learning tools,  and "a lot more people," the company in the last two weeks flagged five times as many videos as "non-safe," or disabled from ads, than before.  "But it's five [times] on the smallest denominator you can imagine," Schindler said. "Although it has historically it has been a very small, small problem. We can make it an even smaller, smaller, smaller problem." Vocal critics suggest Google has ignored this problem. Some publishers and ad agencies have called on Google and rival Facebook Inc. to more actively police the content they host online. In a speech last week, Robert Thomson, Chief Executive Officer of News Corp., a frequent Google critic, said the two digital companies "have prospered mightily by peddling a flat earth philosophy that doesn't wish to distinguish between the fake and real because they make copious amounts of money from both." The YouTube ad boycott has pushed Google to beef up its policing. In its initial response, Google expanded its definition of hate speech to include marginalized groups. Now it's adding a new filter to disable ads on "dangerous and derogatory content," the company said. That includes language that promotes negative stereotypes about targeted groups or denies "sensitive historical events" such as the Holocaust.  Some researchers argue digital platforms should rely on humans to make these editorial decisions. Schindler said he has devoted more manpower to oversee brand safety issues, but stressed that only machine intelligence could contend with YouTube's size. "The problem cannot be solved by humans and it shouldn't be solved by humans," he said. Nor is the company willing to alter YouTube's fundamental formula. Google lets any user upload videos and sets thresholds for which ones can run ads. Tight restrictions on ads could cut funding for independent video creators and step between advertisers and consumers, Schindler said. Google has long pitched YouTube as a digital alternative to television for marketers, making the video service one of its fastest growing sources of ad revenue. "Cutting away the ability for brands to truly interact with consumers by asking for one hundred percent safety is very, very, very unrealistic," Schindler said. The executive likened Google's ad business to an airline: Each faces long-tail risk beyond its control. "Can I guarantee you if I sell an airline ticket that the plane won't come down in the first million miles?" he asked. " You can't guarantee it. You can just depress the error rate to the lowest level."  Read Fin24's top stories trending on Twitter: Fin24’s top stories Read more about: youtube  |  ads share: More In This Category Twitter eases 140-character limit in replies How the Internet of Things will change everyday life Internet of Things: "A connected home in 5 years" Cyber security conference kicks off in Cape Town Most Popular Read Google changes ad policies to end YouTube crisis Samsung redeems itself with the Galaxy S8 Internet of Things: "A connected home in 5 years" MTN paid Nhleko R72.2m for 2016 leadership role How the Internet of Things will change everyday life Contact us   |   About Us   |   Terms & Conditions NEWS24  |   OLX  |   PROPERTY24  |   CAREERS24  |   SPREE  |

Speaking to GadgetsNow, Gulzar Azad, Country Head (Connectivity) at Google India spoke about the company’s plans to spread the “data revolution” to all parts of the country. Google, in fact, hopes to get the average Indian to consume 10 GB of data per month in the next 4-5 years. To achieve this goal, Azad tells GadgetsNow that there needs to be a significant push from government organisations, telcos and Internet Service Provides (ISP). Only then can a goal of 1 billion users using 10 GB of data a month be achieved within this timespan. In the course of the interview, Azad mentioned the Google Station platform, an initiative to bring Wi-Fi kiosks to various parts of the country. Unlike Google’s other Wi-Fi initiative, RailTel, Google Station isn’t a free service. However, it aims to provide Indians with fast, accessible Wi-Fi at very low cost. “Consumption and demand for public Wi-Fi is emerging, which establishes that it is complimentary to 3G and 4G networks,” Azad tells GadgetsNow. Azad had a great deal more to say on Google’s plans in India. Do check out the full interview here for more information.

By Daisuke Wakabayashi New York Times  April 03, 2017 MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. — Over the years, Google trained computer systems to keep copyrighted content and pornography off its YouTube service. But after seeing ads from Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, and Walmart appear next to racist, anti-Semitic, or terrorist videos, its engineers realized their computer models had a blind spot: They did not understand context. Now teaching computers to understand what humans can readily grasp may be the key to calming fears among big-spending advertisers that their ads have been appearing alongside videos from extremist groups and other offensive messages. Advertisement Google engineers, product managers, and policy wonks are trying to train computers to grasp the nuances of what makes certain videos objectionable. Advertisers may tolerate use of a racial epithet in a hip-hop video, for example, but may be horrified to see it used in a video from a racist skinhead group. That ads bought by well-known companies can occasionally appear next to offensive videos has long been considered a nuisance to YouTube’s business. But the issue has gained urgency in recent weeks, as The Times of London and other outlets have written about brands that inadvertently fund extremists through automated advertising — a byproduct of a system in which YouTube shares a portion of ad sales with the creators of the content those ads appear against.

Sign up for more newsletters here This glitch in the company’s giant, automated process turned into a public-relations nightmare. Companies like AT&T and Johnson & Johnson said they would pull their ads from YouTube, as well as Google’s display advertising business, until they could get assurances that such placement would not happen again. Consumers watch more than a billion hours on YouTube every day, making it the dominant video platform on the Internet and an obvious beneficiary as advertising money moves online from television. But the recent problems opened Google to criticism that it was not doing enough to look out for advertisers. It is a significant problem for a multibillion-dollar company that still gets most of its revenue through advertising. “We take this as seriously as we’ve ever taken a problem,” Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer, said in an interview last week. “We’ve been in emergency mode.” Advertisement During the last two weeks, Google has changed what types of videos can carry advertising, barring ads from appearing with hate speech or discriminatory content. In addition, Google is simplifying how advertisers can exclude specific sites, channels, and videos across YouTube and Google’s display network. It is allowing brands to fine-tune the types of content they want to avoid, such as “sexually suggestive” or “sensational/bizarre” videos. It is also putting in more stringent safety standards by default, so an advertiser must choose to place ads next to more provocative content. Google created an expedited way to alert it when ads appear next to offensive content. The Silicon Valley giant is trying to reassure companies like Unilever, the world’s second-largest advertiser, with a portfolio of consumer brands like Dove and Ben & Jerry’s. As other brands started fleeing YouTube, Unilever discovered three instances in which its brands appeared on objectionable YouTube channels. But Keith Weed, chief marketing officer of Unilever, decided not to withdraw its ads because the number of ads appearing with objectionable content was proportionally small. The average $100,000 YouTube campaign runs across more than 7,000 channels, according to the video analytics firm OpenSlate, and Unilever spends hundreds of millions of dollars on YouTube. Also, Google discovered that the ads in question appeared because of a human error in setting safety levels. Weed said it was in Unilever’s best interest to win concessions from Google instead of cutting ties. As part of its new measures, Google agreed to work with outside companies to provide third-party verification about where ads appeared on YouTube. When he broached the idea of independent verification in the past, Weed said, Google executives acted as though he had suggested the company was not trustworthy. He said the issue was not about trust, but about companies being able to “mark their own homework.” ‘No system can be 100 percent perfect. We’re working as hard as we can to make it as safe as possible.’ He said he thought that Google would have agreed eventually, but that “the current situation accelerated their plans.” Google’s efforts are being noticed. Johnson & Johnson, for example, said it had resumed YouTube advertising in a number of countries. Google said other companies were starting to return. For the most part, Google failed to address the issue adequately before because it did not have to; the instances in which ads appeared next to objectionable content happened infrequently and out of view from the broader public. Google said that for many of its top advertisers, the objectionable videos accounted for fewer than one one-thousandth of a percent of their total ad impressions. To train the computers, Google is applying machine-learning techniques — the underlying technology for many of its biggest breakthroughs, like the self-driving car. It has also brought in large human teams (it declined to say how big) to review the appropriateness of videos that computers flagged as questionable. Essentially, they are training computers to recognize footage of a woman in a sports bra and leggings doing yoga poses in an exercise video as safe for advertising and not sexually suggestive content. Similarly, they will mark video of a Hollywood action star waving a gun as acceptable to some advertisers, while flagging a similar image involving an Islamic State gunman as inappropriate. Google used a similar approach in the past to create an automated rating system for videos, similar to movie ratings, based on appropriateness of content for specific audiences. But Google is now trying to solve a different problem. “Computers have a much harder time understanding context, and that’s why we’re actually using all of our latest and greatest machine learning abilities now to get a better feel for this,” Schindler said. Armed with human-verified examples of what is safe and what is not, Google’s computer systems break down the images of a YouTube video frame by frame, analyzing every image. They also digest what is being said, the video’s description from the creator, and other signals to detect patterns and identify subtle cues for what makes a video inappropriate. The idea is for machines to eventually make the tough calls. In the instances when brands feel that Google failed to flag an inappropriate video, that example is fed back into the system so it improves over time. Google said it had already flagged five times as many videos as inappropriate for advertising, although it declined to provide absolute numbers on how many videos that entailed. With more than a billion videos on YouTube, 400 hours of new content being uploaded every minute, and 3 million ad-supported channels on the platform, Schindler said it was impossible to guarantee that Google could eradicate the problem completely. He made a comparison to how a car company could not promise that even a new tire would never fail in the first 10,000 miles. “No system can be 100 percent perfect,” he said. “But we’re working as hard as we can to make it as safe as possible.” Loading comments...

As an assistant professor at the School of Library and Information Sciences, she knows that relieving that angst is her job. “We find students search on Google, decide the first hit is the right one, and then go on with their day,” says Moorefield-Lang. “We also have students who come in and believe if something is on the Internet it must be true. We would like them to know the difference between information that’s research-based [or not] and [between] a scholarly and popular resource.” Preparing students for college is the endeavor of most high school educators. Librarians, in particular, understand the research and critical thinking abilities a college education requires. But often many find themselves hamstrung. If the school has a librarian at all, their scarce resources of time, money, and space may be taken up with test prep requirements at the expense of things such as subscriptions to databases, which nearly every college student will need to know how to navigate. Public libraries, of course, must juggle supporting students with the rest of their constituents—and can only reach those who choose to ask for research help. College librarians, and others who work closely with college freshmen, understand that their high school colleagues are already pressed to do much with little. Yet that doesn’t mean they don’t have a wish list of what first-year students should come armed with in terms of scholarly skills. Pulling the plug on Google As the director of undergraduate programs at Yale University, New Haven, CT, Emily Horning says many incoming students are familiar with databases, but Google dependency is still fairly ­common. So Horning and her colleagues often work with students to refine keyword searches and locate details they need. Her goal is to help them find source materials they wouldn’t discover with a search engine—and have them understand that they’re expected to do this kind of in-depth work at this point in their education. “They realize that the kind of sources their professors will want to see are things they can find in the library,” she says. “Not necessarily poking around on Google.” Nonetheless, students sometimes push back at instruction on how to use databases, or how to work around a gap in the scholarly record. Eliot ­Finkelstein of the College Library at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-M) says students will say they’re switching topics because they can’t find any information on their initial idea. Finkelstein, public services librarian and instruction coordinator for the university’s undergraduate library, knows this attitude reflects today’s culture, in which Google results come up in a nanosecond. But, he says, that’s the antithesis of what college, or scholarly, work is about. Instead, he wants students to understand they’re contributing to a conversation—and are expected to put forward a new, original thought. To do that? Students must invest their time and ideally their excitement. “Research is messy,” says Finkelstein. “If there’s nothing on your topic, or you’re not finding anything, maybe that’s a good thing. Then you can add a point of view that hasn’t been explored and find other sources that can help you bring that out. It’s a discovery process.” Plagiarism school Working with students who don’t know how to quote or cite other people’s materials properly is another hurdle college librarians face. Yale’s Horning sends students to reference books or online sites such as Zotero and EndNote, which can help them format their materials quickly and accurately. Still, there are students who just don’t understand that they must credit others and that failing to do so is plagiarism and not allowed in college. Kent State University, OH, actually runs a so-called plagiarism school, managed by librarians for students who have been caught plagiarizing. The librarians walk the offenders through their papers, explaining the proper method of attribution. If the students get help with the citations, they can sometimes still get a grade for that work, albeit lower than what they would have gotten had they cited appropriately in the first place. “We also have sessions to explain what plagiarism is,” says Jasmine Jefferson, a first-year experience librarian at Kent State. “But students can only come to plagiarism school once.” Freshman wish list Even as college librarians understand, and voice their recognition, that high school librarians are working with limitations, they still wish freshmen had, at least, some familiarity with writing a research paper. “Something beyond a report,” says Sherri Saines, a reference librarian at Ohio University’s Vernon Alden Library in Athens. “A writing exercise in which the student gathers information, digests it, learns something from it, and then writes about it. Our students come without that experience, which is surprising. I have talked with high school librarians, and they say, ‘I lost all that time because of testing.’ It makes me want to scream.” Allison Mackley gets that concern. That’s why the teacher-librarian and library department chair at Hershey High School, PA, runs a semesterlong class called “Ethical Research from Passion to Purpose,” with the end result an original research paper. “The class is becoming more popular because kids realize they need these skills when they start college,” she says. “One student also got an internship in Washington, DC, based on her project, the use of social media in political campaigns.” Cathy Jo Nelson wants to help her 2,400 students at Paul M. Dorman High School in Roebuck, SC, so she invests heavily in databases so the high schoolers are familiar with these online resources before they start college. Nelson estimates the school has about 30 databases available, some paid for by the state and about seven paid for by the school. “Every year the purchase order crosses [the principal’s] desk and he asks if these are necessary,” she says. “We have to justify it every year. But we have a heavy emphasis on making our students college career ready. And one way we do that is by beefing up on subscription databases to make sure [our students are] exposed to what their college environment will be as well.” IdaMae Craddock starts even younger. As the librarian at Burley Middle School (BMS) in Charlottesville, VA, Craddock gets her sixth to eighth graders started by building annotated bibliographies. The middle schoolers learn how to use citations and are taught to recognize a reliable source—and what is not. Craddock knows how important research skills are during the college years. Before working at BMS, she spent three years as the school librarian at Monticello High School, also in Charlottesville, working with AP English students on their research projects, helping them to locate and spot reliable and primary sources. “That’s especially important now at the middle school as we have a Maker Lab in the library,” says Craddock. “So whatever the students want to make, the instructions need to be from a reliable source.” Building partnerships When she was at the high school, Craddock says she partnered with a librarian at the University of Virginia who would come to the school to talk with students about college-level research. She also arranged a field trip so students could find primary sources on their own. Other colleges, among them Kent State and UW-M, say they support that back-and-forth with the high schools in their area. Yet whenever the students show up—as high schoolers or college freshmen—librarians want that first experience of exploring a college library to remain fun. If students feel criticized for not knowing how to research a paper, properly source material, or locate information they need for a project, they’re not only less likely to do well—they’re less likely to ask for help again. Getting hung up on where they are and putting added stress on their experience will only alienate students further. And that doesn’t help them—nor the college hoping to provide their education. “We take them where they are,” says Virginia Tech instruction librarian Carolyn Meier. “We move them forward and show them all the cool stuff we have and what we can do to help them. The more positive you are, the more excited you are, the happier they will be. If you approach them with, ‘This is how you can do this, and it’s easy’ rather than, ‘Why didn’t you learn this in high school?’ it [opens] a better frame of mind for them and a better frame of mind for us.” This article was published in Library Journal's May 15, 2016 issue.

News outlets report that companies have replaced workers with IBM Watson and algorithms are beating doctors at diagnoses. New AI startups pop up every day and claim to solve all your personal and business problems with machine learning. Ordinary objects like juicers and Wi-Fi routers suddenly advertise themselves as “powered by AI”. Not only can smart standing desks remember your height settings, they can also order you lunch. Much of the AI hubbub is generated by reporters who’ve never trained a neural network and startups or those hoping to be acquihired for engineering talent despite not solving any real business problems. No wonder there are so many misconceptions about what AI can and cannot do. Deep learning is undeniably mind-blowing Neural networks were invented in the 60s, but recent boosts in big data and computational power made them actually useful. A new discipline called “deep learning” arose and applied complex neural network architectures to model patterns in data more accurately than ever before. The results are undeniably incredible. Computers can now recognize objects in images and video and transcribe speech to text better than humans can. Google replaced Google Translate’s architecture with neural networks and now machine translation is also closing in on human performance. The practical applications are mind-blowing as well. Computers can predict crop yield better than the USDA and indeed diagnose cancer more accurately than elite physicians. John Launchbury, a Director at DARPA, describes three waves of artificial intelligence: 1) Handcrafted knowledge, or expert systems like IBM’s Deep Blue or Watson, 2) Statistical learning, which includes machine learning and deep learning, and 3) Contextual adaption, which involves constructing reliable, explanatory models for real world phenomena using sparse data, like humans do. As part of the current second wave of AI, deep learning algorithms work well because of what Launchbury calls the “manifold hypothesis” (see below). In simplified terms, this refers to how different types of high-dimensional natural data tend to clump and be shaped differently when visualized in lower dimensions. Above: Image Credit: John Launchbury / DARPA By mathematically manipulating and separating data clumps, deep neural networks can distinguish different data types. While neural nets can achieve nuanced classification and predication capabilities they are essentially what Launchbury calls “spreadsheets on steroids.” Above: Image Credit: John Launchbury / DARPA Deep learning also has deep problems At the recent AI By The Bay conference, Francois Chollet emphasized that deep learning is simply more powerful pattern recognition vs. previous statistical and machine learning methods. “The most important problem for A.I today is abstraction and reasoning,” explains Chollet, an AI Researcher at Google and famed inventor of widely used deep learning library Keras. “Current supervised perception and reinforcement learning algorithms require lots of data, are terrible at planning, and are only doing straightforward pattern recognition.” By contrast, humans “learn from very few examples, can do very long-term planning, and are capable of forming abstract models of a situation and manipulate these models to achieve extreme generalization.” Even simple human behaviors are laborious to teach to a deep learning algorithm. Let’s examine the task of not being hit by a car as you walk down the road. If you go the supervised learning route, you’d need huge data sets of car situations with clearly labeled actions to take, such as “stop” or “move”. Then you’d need to train a neural network to learn the mapping between the situation and the appropriate action. If you go the reinforcement learning route, where you give an algorithm a goal and let it independently determine the ideal actions to take, the computer would need to die thousands of times before learning to avoid cars in different situations. “You cannot achieve general intelligence simply by scaling up today’s deep learning techniques,” warns Chollet. Humans only need to be told once to avoid cars. We’re equipped with the ability to generalize from just a few examples and are capable of imagining (i.e. modeling) the dire consequences of being run over. Without losing life or limb, most of us quickly learn to avoid being overrun by motor vehicles. While neural networks achieve statistically impressive results across large sample sizes, they are “individually unreliable” and often make mistakes humans would never make, such as classify a toothbrush as a baseball bat. Above: Image Credit: John Launchbury / DARPA Your results are only as good as your data. Neural networks fed inaccurate or incomplete data will simply produce the wrong results. The outcomes can be both embarrassing and damaging. In two major PR debacles, Google Images incorrectly classified African Americans as gorillas, while Microsoft’s Tay learned to spew racist, misogynistic hate speech after only hours training on Twitter. Undesirable biases may even be implicit in our input data. Google’s massive Word2Vec embeddings are built off of 3 million words from Google News.  The data set makes associations such as “father is to doctor as mother is to nurse” which reflect gender bias in our language. Researchers such as Tolga Bolukbasi of Boston University have taken to human ratings on Mechanical Turk to perform “hard de-biasing” to undo the associations. Such tactics are essential since, according to Bolukbasi, “word embeddings not only reflect stereotypes but can also amplify them.” If the term “doctor” is more associated with men than women, then an algorithm might prioritize male job applicants over female job applicants for open physician positions. Finally, Ian Goodfellow, inventor of generative adversarial networks (GANs), showed that neural networks can be deliberately tricked with adversarial examples. By mathematically manipulating an image in a way that is undetectable to the human eye, sophisticated attackers can trick neural networks into grossly misclassifying objects. Above: Image Credit: Ian Goodfellow What’s beyond deep learning?  How can we overcome the limitations of deep learning and proceed towards general artificial intelligence? Chollet’s initial plan of attack involves using “super-human pattern recognition like deep learning to augment explicit search and formal systems”, starting with the field of mathematical proofs. Automated Theorem Provers (ATPs) typically use brute force search and quickly hit combinatorial explosions in practical use. In the DeepMath project, Chollet and his colleagues used deep learning to assist the proof search process, simulating a mathematician’s intuitions about what lemmas might be relevant. Another approach is to develop more explainable models. In handwriting recognition, neural nets currently need to be trained on tens to hundreds of thousands of examples to perform decent classification. Instead of looking at just pixels, however, Launchbury of DARPA explains that generative models can be taught the strokes behind any given character and use this physical construction information to disambiguate between similar numbers, such as a 9 or a 4. Yann LeCun, inventor of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and director of AI research at Facebook, proposes “energy-based models” as a method of overcoming limits in deep learning. Typically, a neural network is trained to produce a single output, such as an image label or sentence translation. LeCun’s energy-based models instead give an entire set of possible outputs, such as the many ways a sentence could be translated, along with scores for each configuration. Geoffrey Hinton, widely called the “father of deep learning” wants to replace neurons in neural networks with “capsules” which he believes more accurately reflect the cortical structure in the human mind. “Evolution must have found an efficient way to adapt features that are early in a sensory pathway so that they are more helpful to features that are several stages later in the pathway,” Hinton explains. He hopes that capsule-based neural network architectures will be more resistant to the adversarial attacks that Goodfellow illuminated above. Perhaps all of these approaches to overcoming the limits of deep learning have truth value. Perhaps none of them do. Only time and continued investment in AI research will tell.

However, Google started phasing out Code for most users in 2013, and Google's projects are the only active repositories left. Now the company has started to shift to a new issue tracker, hosted at issuetracker.google.com. The feedback page for Android O states that the new issue tracker has been used internally at Google for a while now, but now the site is publicly-accessible to help collect feedback and bug reports from Android O Dev Preview users. The tracker appears to be split into categories called 'components,' with Android O being one. In addition to Android O, there are components for many other Google services, from the Chromecast SDK to Google's public DNS server.

Google Map Maker is officially dead Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/02 8:46am PDTApr 2, 2017 25 Plus 1 on G+ 55 Share on Facebook 49 Share on Twitter Total Shares129 Google News Google Map Maker was introduced back in 2008, as a way for users to make contributions to Google Maps. Features like roads, highways, rivers, and so on could be added to Maps, and users could fill in details about businesses and other specific locations. After some vandalism occurred thanks to Google's poor moderation, the feature was removed entirely, and re-appeared later with less functionality. Google has been working to integrate Map Maker features into Google Maps itself, and announced in November that the independent Map Maker service would shut down. Now Map Maker is officially dead. Google's support page says that most of Map Maker's functionality is already in Maps, and the company will continue to add new features as time goes on.

But... But... Oh wait, I got nothing. Leo Herzog If I have an edit to contribute to a park or college campus boundary, how am I supposed to do that? 😆😄 "Suggest an edit" on the location. Leonardo Baez Sadly in my country is blocked. There are several errors in street names, and some streets have changed circulation direction. aRvInD I was proud Regional lead in that program but after whole Android pissing on Apple fiasco, functionality got heavily restricted. i knew they soon will kill this program... iMarbot "Google's support page says that most of Map Maker's functionality is already in Maps"... biggest lie I have heard ALL YEAR Sruly J You must not get out much. ;) Travis Halfman Alternative Facts. caruso81 What does this do to making custom points of interest and uploading to your GPS? (I'm aware GPS units are dead and the mobile phone is the way to go. I'm also aware that US carrier data in Europe is obscenely priced and that I already own a GPS with hundreds of custom POIs loaded onto it.) IVBela What if I want to mark duplicate places? Oh nevermind... Leonardo Baez this is buls*** There are many countries were the only source for trusted information is the comunity. With this change now we cannot change street names, street directions, allowed and prohibited turns, add returns or new road crosses. This is buls*** google. When in hell will you designate a team to do maps of bolivia, or agola or suriname? We the users are the contributors because no one else gives tools or trusted maps as google. And now all the maps will be frozen in time circa 2015 (because for many countries google stopped edits in 2015). I'm mad as hell TannoV If you'd actually read the article, you'd have read that the functionality has been integrated into Google maps. Tomáš Petrík And if you'd actually tried that, you'd have found out that you can only add/edit places like businesses and other POIs. However, it is not possible to rename a street, edit directions and/or turns, etc. modeless And if *you'd* actually tried that, you would have seen that as a Local Guide it is possible to rename a street, edit segment attributes and also report missing roads. roberto.elena Re editing directions and/or turns: There is a workaround for this. I've used it several times, because Map Maker was never available in Spain (one of the 20 or so countries out of 200 that wasn't lucky enough). What you do is set a route between 2 points that pass through that street or a make that turn you want to edit, and then use the feedback tool to report where the problem is. As I said, I've used it several times to correct illegal turns. Upvotes4Bird Thanks to Google's poor moderation? Thanks to shitty users. poop. It was both. Grey Map Maker had a piece of shit moderation community with bullshit, "what we want" rules. Trying to correct an issue is a nightmare. Trying to add something is a nightmare. No way to add building corrections after the vandalism. Trying to add a path that goes by a road is not allowed sometimes - despite tons of these paths existing. And they use Google Street View - despite Google Street View being quite a bit off the ground and giving a warped perspective. I love the idea behind Map Maker, I hate the moderation community and their stupid idea of rules. poop. It's still like this even with the "new" system jdrch Google killed another product users were relying on? No way! Stop the presses! Unheard of! Adrianus AJ Nadeak Map Maker was not working in one country used to live in. I did manage to name a street using Map Maker years ago but then it stopped working. With the country's frantic construction rate, many new roads have been built or redirected and as a result, Google Maps isn't as accurate as my current location. Many roundabouts have been converted to traffic signal intersections and a section of a new ring road is non existent. POI and places can be edited and added within the Maps app so that's not much of an issue.

Daydream VR support is absent on the Galaxy S8 and S8+ Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/02 1:56pm PDTApr 2, 2017 42 Plus 1 on G+ 88 Share on Facebook 57 Share on Twitter Total Shares187 Galaxy S8 News Samsung Google initially spearheaded virtual reality on Android with Google Cardboard, which evolved into the more complete Daydream VR platform. Unlike Cardboard, which could start on any somewhat-recent Android or iOS device, Daydream support requires the phone manufacturer and Google to make sure everything works. Unfortunately, it looks like the Samsung isn't supporting Daydream VR on the new Galaxy S8 and S8+. According to VRHeads, trying to install the Daydream app will result in an error message. This could be due to a previous agreement with Oculus (which helped develop the Gear VR), but there's also a strong possibility that Samsung just doesn't care to support it. Admittedly, Daydream VR doesn't have very much content, and Samsung's own Gear VR platform has plenty of apps and games. Still, it's annoying to see that the already-minuscule mobile VR market is fragmented.

Kappa saf1927 What is VR again? Ah, some shit that everyone likes to experience once and then realises it's shit. Morten Ulv I must have missed the part where it's shit. Kevin It was actually cool. It really tricks your brain, but I had the opportunity to play a game in an open space. Only thing bad was the actual gameplay. Nothing like COD George Byers Seems that the only way to get Samsung to support anything Google is to make it compulsory in order to get access to the play store 😒 Willie Chalmers III You knew just what I was thinking. If Google included another no-compete clause in the GMS partner agreement for VR-related platforms, Daydream could finally solidify itself as the Android platform for VR. (Although, Samsung and Oculus could easily sue that Google is abusing their market share and all the other crap we have seen before for requiring partners to preload Google apps.)

YaKillaCJ Not surprising and to be expected. The general public see Samsung TouchWiz/GraceUx as Android itself. Google lost control a long time ago. Kwetsima Maluleke Not a lose. Oculus just has so much more to offer here. Morten Ulv And name one service that Samsung provice that's better than what Google offer. That's right there are none. Daydream may not be much now, but it has much more promise than Gear VR. Dominick White so people should wait until Google gets better, or go with Samsung that is know to work very well? Morten Ulv It would obviously have both. This would be like Nvidia only supporting Oculus and not Vive. They only chose to not support it, because, fuck consumers. I'm not saying it's unexpected, or that it won't work. Because Samsung obviously has a lot of power here, and VR is not a main selling point for these phones. MicroNix When Samsung is giving away a GearVR with every S8 purchase, there's not a lot of incentive to support a smaller, questionable as to how long it will be around because its Google, VR platform. Morten Ulv Samsung will not give away a GearVR with every S8, you must be dreaming. Perhaps as a time limited and location limited promotional offer. EcE It is at launch but they also do it every high season (black Friday, back to school, etc) and there are promotions quite often. As much as I would like to use some cardboard apps/videos on my s7 (and obviously daydream) there's zero incentive for Samsung to support it. And like a lot of people here, I wouldn't be surprised if Google would just ditch it in a couple of years JohnyNoLegs Gear VR was before Daydream, google decided to add another one to the group. MicroNix Until Google gets tired of it and stops active support of it. Are you new to Google products or something? Dubs816 Name one service that Samsung provides that's better than what Google offers? Let's see... ever heard of Samsung Pay? The service that works in tens of thousands of places Android Pay doesn't? JohnyNoLegs Man it's too late, typical google. Copy Samsung years down the road then expect everyone to pick it up. Gear VR is already established and has a user base. DragoCubed Samsung pay. Kwetsima Maluleke Android TV? Android Pay? The Samsung counterparts are better. Kwetsima Maluleke And you delusional if you think the Daydream VR will catch up to the Gear VR. Whether its sales or content. Nathan J You can root for Oculus if you want, but you have to accept and be transparent about the fact that it's owned and controlled by Facebook. Oculus founder Palmer Luckey has left. What you mean is that Facebook has so much more to offer. The major players in the VR space are Valve (HTC Vive), Facebook (Oculus Rift), and Google (Daydream). I won't deny that Facebook is in the lead here, but I have no intention of supporting them against the other two. I personally like Daydream, since it uses phones. I hope Apple doesn't develop their own thing, and just works with Google (as they have on search, and Google apps working so well on iOS). Daydream being multi-platform would be huge. Jordon De La Cruz Does the s8 fit into the previous gear VR? Kwetsima Maluleke Nope. Only the new one. fredric If Samsung had to choose between Oculos or Google's Daydream, it a no brainier to choose Oculos since they're mostly the acknowledged pioneers in this field. The really​ important question is, are they truly forced into choosing only one of them?? My first thought when I saw their new GearVR set with a controller was Daydream support. They're either working towards supporting it, or just a good feature they can't ignore. In either case (and my opinion, at least), almost nothing is still worth getting a VR headset for (including Vive and the Rift) but would still be interested into trying it for its reasonable price. Leif Sikorski That's not a big suprise I think. GearVR feels much more responsive than Daydream so it makes sense to focus on the new GearVR instead of Daydream which was very late in the game. Samsung and Oculus stand behind their VR solution since years while Google hasn't done much yet and is known for quickly quitting such things. Christopher Bailey (Xcom923) Is anyone surprised by this news? AbbyZFresh Does it really matter? Developers seem to be supporting and releasing apps for GearVR more than they've been doing for DayDream. shonangreg Can I use Gear VR on my non-Samsung phones? No? Then it is doomed. When one or two competitors are good enough and available across devices (and platforms), then VR app makers will go to them (and Samsung might open Gear VR to prevent this also). There is no reason to play this stupid vendor lock-in game with VR headsets. AbbyZFresh I would agree with you except for the following factors. 1. Samsung alone sells more phones(especially VR-compatible high end phones) than all the other following Andorid brands combined. Which means Samsung has the most exposure. 2. Gear VR is supported by Oculus, which means it will always have relevance since the two platforms are increasingly linked. 3. Samsung is actively pushing VR with their phones pushing demos for people to try. Couldn't find any places to demo Daydream. shonangreg I don't think you're right on point #1. Samsung has about 20% of the worldwide smartphone market, and android is about 85% of that: http://www.idc.com/promo/smartphone-market-share/vendor So just off the top of my head, Samsung has maybe 30% of the android market. Point #2: I didn't know that. If they're making Gear VR cross platform like that, then it would be way more worthwhile. X-47B You need context in everything. #1: Samsung alone sells more phones(especially VR-compatible high end phones). S/He's right in that saying Samsung leads VR-compatible phone sales. Gear VR had shipped around 5 million in 2016, more than every other brands combined. Joshua Hill Can I use daydream on the G6 or any other non pixel flagship??? No then it's doomed lol Dominick White well to be honest it's kinda supported on axon 7 Joshua Hill My bad, now that i've actually checked some moto z phones have daydream support too. Allegedly if you root your phone and insert a single line of code any device is daydream compatible including the S8. JohnyNoLegs Could I use VR on any Nexus phone prior to Daydream? No FAIL. Also Gear VR is still better than Daydream, and has more games and support. Samsung actually support VR...unlike google... Joshua Hill dude you replied to the wrong person or your comprehension sucks!!! lol I was pointing out how ridiculous shonangreg's comment was and how his arguments against gear vr could also be applied to daydream. Oops!!!!!! hahaha JohnyNoLegs Fair enough but it wasn't immediately obvious, considering that Samsung don't support daydream is actually kinda stupid. But yes ignore me then. ShahinTr Utterly convenient.. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/60efae9a00168334a9c265167f8a740795662842c4f1394c015eb51fd1b99d36.jpg MicroNix Which was first, Gear VR or Daydream? Which do you think will be around the longest, something from Samsung or something from Google? There, that should put things into perspective for you. ShahinTr Dude. Jeez. It's a meme. Just go with it. Please. MicroNix Its just an overused term in Android. TannoV It's also a true term. Mert Oculus Store has many options. But anyway, my Gear VR is waiting me with a lots of dusts on it. That technology is going to die if someone won't come with a solid idea. Good_Ole_Pinocchio I mean there are solid ideas. That doesn't mean people actually want it though. Good ideas don't always sell. Mert I can't say whole store is garbage but still VR tech looking desperately for it's own Angry Birds. Good_Ole_Pinocchio I think everyday people would want more Triple A titles that aren't games. Less games and more pushing life like experiences will help bring folks onboard. Then the next step should be having these experiences at the same time with Friends and family. Not a "My turn ,your turn" set up that we have now. Jose Romero Good, this will only make Google work harder to make Daydream a success and to improve it. Vivek Rameses Good. Jon Fridman VR is a little pointless on smartphones. I'd understand buying a HTC Vive or Oculus VR for your PC not for a phone. I've tried the Google Daydream for the Pixel XL and Samsung Gear VR, neither are what I'd call good. I'd rather use my desktop for VR or nothing. Phones aren't up to par with what VR needs yet. I think using a phone hurts the public image of what VR is truly capable of. senor_heisenberg Eh, neither platform is particularly worthwhile. That said, I'll always prefer to have​ the one that's not tied to a single OEM's hardware. Joshua Hill At the moment they both are lol Grey "It's annoying to see that the already-minuscule mobile VR market is fragmented." I agree on that, but you have to agree that Google can't own everything, and that companies shouldn't allow Google to own everything, or go along with Google on all of its ideas. It's like Steam. Would it be easier if all PC games were on Steam and I didn't need anything more? Sure. Would it be better for the market? No. Me Not really surprising Kenny One the one hand, it's nice to have options. On the other hand, if Google tries to require Daydream support as a prerequisit for certification, then it might end up being another Microsoft case of using the platform to force dorminance. Then again, it's also nice to not have fragmentation. Life is so difficult ... :/ Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Be together, not the same. Differentiation means competition, which is a good thing. Joshua Hill Competition is bad when it means a potential lack of content. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's only bad for the loser of the competition. But that's why competition is good. The best thing wins out. Joshua Hill Ah no. It's bad for the consumer who cannot acquire the content they desire on their platform as well. How did you not get the point??? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You don't understand competition, then. Remember Betamax? It lost. So people stopped caring about content on Betamax. Same thing here. May the best VR win, and then all the content will go there. Joshua Hill Are we talking about today or some unspecified future date you have in your head??? The future is irrelevant as neither of these formats will survive in their current iterations. Consumers will have to buy a new VR I do remember betamax and I bet those users who owned VHS's but couldn't buy the content they wanted because it was exclusive to Betamax would comprehend my point. You do understand that this sort of competition breeds exclusive content. Going back to my initial comment which you seem not to comprehend, this leads to a 'potential lack of content' for the consumer. This means the consumer loses too. Joshua Hill I'm not saying competition is all bad. You claimed it was good and I provided an example of how it can also be bad for the consumer. If you can't comprehend this and discuss the issue I've raised there's really no point continuing the conversation. pfmiller There's a big difference between this and a format war between two physically incompatible storage mediums like VHS and Betamax. There's no reason why a modern phone can't support both Daydream and Gear VR. Joshua Hill Be together implies that competing formats should be supported on all phones that have the hardware capabilities to do so. This is more a case of 'Go it alone, we're all different anyways' ;) Wilton Daniel Pinto VR has no future. Duh😪 dhamp2g This is some bull. I bought a dream while it was on sale bc I thought this phone support dream, ROB Since when has Samsung ever stood for support... can you imagine how long it would take to get an update for the program... hell I am still waiting for 7.0 ast00 VR on phones is pointless. But still... Why? Because Samsung . Kevin Davis Is anyone actually surprised? kalehv Is it just me that owns a pixel, has a free daydream viewer but doesn't even care to dust it off? Margaritas Ante Porcos lol Samsung is digging its grave. Everyday something bad comes up about on s8. tim242 Haha you have been smoking some bad shit. Joshua Hill Can i have some of what you're on??? I'm not a samsung fan, I'm prolly getting an S8 but my last sammy was an S2. I'd like to hear the drug induced reasoning to your claim lol Margaritas Ante Porcos You comment is rude. At your age you should know how to communicate without rudeness, shouldn't you? Joshua Hill If you are going to spread malicious misinformation and not substantiate it you should be used to rude replies! Margaritas Ante Porcos And yet you are continuing being impolite. Obviously, you've got personal reasons to disrespect absolute strangers on the web. After all the world is spinning around your corrosive little ego, isn't it? I don't find it entertaining to feed your unhealthy appetite for ridiculing others. So, bite me. Joshua Hill My 2nd response was not impolite at all it was a simple opinion or statement of the facts as I see it. Would you care to discuss the crux of the issue. I'm still awaiting for you to substantiate the original claim you made which i consider malicious and factually incorrect! 'Everyday something bad', you must have an awfully long list of bad things about the S8 that have been revealed and yet so far you have provided none! Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Just like Android Wear vs. Samsung Gear watches... very very annoying! "But they said in the store my watch is 100% Android compatible" As an Android Wear developer I get this question on a daily basis (even though I try to make it clear in the app description and inside the app too). It is extremely confusing to regular people. Now the same all over again with VR.

Could be (much) worse: it sleeted on April 23, 1972 at Met Stadium in Bloomington. The Twins Opener in 1962 brought wind chills in the 20s, but the first home game in 1980 featured a sweaty high of 90F. Considering we could be ankle-deep in slush I'll keep my big mouth shut. It's dry out there; much of the area running a 1-2 inch rainfall deficit, so let's not complain about showers on a Monday. The sun peeks out tomorrow; Wednesday's storm tracks well south of Minnesota. Temperatures may push 70F next weekend close to home with T-storms Sunday. There's still some lingering confusion over semantics: is it 'global warming' or 'climate change'? Some federal and state agencies have now banned the use of the word, climate change. Not to worry. "Late Late Show" host James Corden may have the right idea. He refers to climate change as "endless summer". Tornadoes are now "fun-time twisty winds". And earthquakes can be referred to as "dirt twerking". Give it a try. March: 19th Month in a Row of Warmer Than Average at MSP. Here's an excerpt from Dr. Mark Seeley at Minnesota WeatherTalk: "Most climate observers reported mean monthly temperature values near normal, or 1 to 2 degrees F warmer than normal for the month. For MSP Airport it was the 19 consecutive month with above normal temperature. For most climate stations over half the days of the month were warmer than normal. Minnesota reported the coldest temperature in the nation on four dates during the month..." Severe Threat Shifts East. The same atmospheric cocktail responsible for a series of violent tornadoes over Louisiana Sunday will push into southern Alabama today; tornadic storms possible early tonight into southwest Georgia. Map: NOAA SPC. Tornado Bull-seye. The greatest chance of supercell thunderstorms capable of tornadoes will be over southern Alabama, especially Montgomery, Greenville, Troy and Auburn into Mobile and the far western Panhandle of Florida, near Pensacola. More violent, long-track tornadoes are expected to spin up later today. A Tortured Pattern. Not much of a break in between weather systems right now. Today's storm drags a severe squall line across the Deep South with hail, violent straight-line winds and a few tornadoes. The parent storm pushes rain across the Ohio Valley, Great Lakes and Mid Atlantic, mixing with wet snow and sleet across northern New Hampshire. A second storm on its heels pushes heavy wet snow into Chicago and Grand Rapids by Wednesday and early Thursday. No rest for the weather-weary with this pattern. 84-hour NAM Future Radar: NOAA and Tropicaltidbits.com. Tornado Sirens are "Cold War Technology". Remember that sirens were only meant to be heard outdoors,  not inside homes and businesses. Sirens are part of the warning process, but if you only rely on sirens you're going to get caught with your Doppler down. Here's a clip from News-Gazette: "...While people in the country might not be able to hear the sirens, just about every emergency official interviewed for this story pointed out without prompting that tornado sirens are outdoor warning sirens. "You won't hear them inside your house," Mahomet's Crowley said. "If your windows are closed, you're not going to hear it unless you're right under it." The NWS' Miller said sirens aren't necessarily the best way to learn about a potential tornado. "There's so many ways to get information," he said. "Don't just say, 'I'm not going to go to the basement until the siren goes off.'" He encouraged people to use a weather radio and to monitor social media. Smartphones also now automatically send alerts for tornado and flash flood warnings. "To be honest, it's Cold War technology," Miller said about tornado sirens. "It's an important part of the process, but what people have to understand is, it's not the only part of the process." Cyclone, Flood Cost "Beyond Comprehension". Cyclone (same thing as a hurricane) "Debbie" did quite a number on Queensland, Australia. Here's an excerpt of an update at news.com.au: "The full cost of cleaning up cyclone and flood-affected parts of Queensland won't be known for weeks, but local authorities fear "the sky is the limit" for the damage bill. One man is confirmed dead, three others are still missing and Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk described the devastation across the state as "huge" after meeting with emergency services in Daisy Hill on Sunday. "It's going to take months to repair," Ms Palaszczuk said. About 650 residences throughout northern parts of the state have been ruled uninhabitable since Cyclone Debbie hit the coast on Tuesday. Flooding has inundated 38 homes in the southeast and continues to threaten about 250 properties..." Stumbling Into Spring. Weather never moves in a straight line. Oh, how I wish it did. Expect mostly 50s this week, but both ECMWF (above) and NOAA models show a warm spike next weekend; a growing chance of 70 degrees by next Sunday, depending on convection (T-storms would keep things a few degrees cooler). Twin Cities meteograph: WeatherBell. Mid-April: Cool & Stormy East, Mild West. The 2 week GFS forecast at 500 mb (18,000 feet) shows a lingering trough of low pressure over the eastern USA, with ridging from the Rockies to the Plains, where temperatures may run above average. Towns Where April Is Snowiest Month of the Year. Who knew? From the Black Hills of South Dakota into parts of Colorado and Wyoming, according to research compiled by prolific climate guru Brian Brettschneider. Vast, Untapped Potential for Solar Rooftops in the U.S., Says Google. Here's an excerpt of a post at Greentech Media that made me do a double-take: "...Now that Project Sunroof's availability is countrywide, Google’s amassed data has started to reveal some interesting trends and information. For one thing, Google says that 79 percent of the rooftops it’s analyzed are viable for solar, which is good news for rooftop solar providers. That doesn’t mean that 79 percent of rooftops should or will adopt solar, though. Rather, it means that 79 percent technically get enough sun to be able to accommodate solar panels.  That finding is likely a generous interpretation of the data..." A "Solar Saudi Arabia". No coal, gas or oil? Not to worry in Chile, which is blasted by free solar energy yearround. There may be no country on Earth in a better position to take full advantage of clean, renewable power, argues The Washington Post: "...It is also the world’s best place to produce solar energy, with the most potent sun power on the planet. So powerful, in fact, that something extraordinary happened last year when the Chilean government invited utility companies to bid on public contracts. Solar producers dominated the auction, offering to supply electricity at about half the cost of coal-fired plants. It wasn’t because of a government subsidy for alternative energy. In Chile and a growing list of nations, the price of solar energy has fallen so much that it is increasingly beating out conventional sources of power. Industry experts and government regulators hail this moment as a turning point in the history of human electricity-making. “This is the beginning of a trend that will only accelerate,” said Chilean Energy Minister Andrés Rebolledo. “We’re talking about an infinite fuel source...” Wind Power Cuts CO2. Here's an excerpt from Climate Central: "We’ve reached the end of the windiest month of the year. But in other months, wind will continue to play an increasingly large role in the U.S. power mix. At the end of last year, wind capacity surpassed hydroelectric capacity for the first time in the U.S. Over the past decade, wind power has exploded in the U.S. Over that time, generating capacity from wind has increased by a factor of seven, surpassing 82,000 megawatts, or enough to power 24 million homes. Wind is most consistent in the Great Plains and on the Front Range of the Rockies. The prevailing west winds come rushing off of the mountains, making the area especially conducive for generating electricity, as higher wind speeds produce disproportionately more power from a wind turbine..." Hackers Next Target Could Be the U.S. Electric Grid. Here's an excerpt from CNBC: "You've heard about hackers trying to steal credit card numbers and wipe out bank accounts. But there's another group that many cybersecurity experts say especially worry them. These criminals are targeting critical infrastructure, like power grids — and what makes them dangerous is that some are backed by governments and big money. "Turning off water, turning off electricity. Those are all realistic attacks now," said Liam O' Murchu a director with cybersecurity company Symantec, the manufacturer of Norton security products. Symantec is currently tracking more than 100 government backed groups, more than ten times the number from five years ago..." (Map credit: FEMA). UW Professor: The Information War is Real, and We're Losing It. Because conspiracy theories are so much more interesting than reality. Here's an excerpt of a harrowing story at The Seattle Times: "...Starbird is in the UW’s Department of Human Centered Design & Engineering — the study of the ways people and technology interact. Her team analyzed 58 million tweets sent after mass shootings during a 10-month period. They searched for terms such as “false flag” and “crisis actor,” web slang meaning a shooting is not what the government or the traditional media is reporting it to be. It happens after every mass shooting or attack. If you search for “false flag” and “Westminster,” you’ll find thousands of results theorizing that last week’s attack outside British Parliament was staged (presumably to bring down Brexit, which makes no sense, but making sense is not a prerequisite). Starbird’s insight was to map the digital connections between all this buzzing on Twitter with a conglomeration of websites. Then she analyzed the content of each site to try to answer the question: Just what is this alternative media ecosystem saying?..." ESPN Has Seen the Future of TV and They're Not Really Into It. Is ESPN reinventing and innovating fast enough? Here's food for thought from Bloomberg Businessweek: "...In some respects, the challenges facing ESPN are the same that confront every other media company: Young people simply aren’t consuming cable TV, newspapers, or magazines in the numbers they once did, and digital outlets still aren’t lucrative enough to make up the deficit. But while most of ESPN’s TV peers have courted cord cutters—CBS and Turner Broadcasting, for instance, are allowing anyone to watch some of their March Madness games online for free—ESPN’s view cuts against the conventional wisdom in new media. “Everything we do supports the pay television business,” says John Kosner, the network’s head of digital and print media. The strategy, simply put: Defend the cable-TV bundle at all costs..." Elon Musk's Billion-Dollar Crusade to Stop the A.I. Apocalypse. It's cheap hype until it happens, then it's "why weren't we prepared?" Here's an excerpt from Vanity Fair: "...You’d think that anytime Musk, Stephen Hawking, and Bill Gates are all raising the same warning about A.I.—as all of them are—it would be a 10-alarm fire. But, for a long time, the fog of fatalism over the Bay Area was thick. Musk’s crusade was viewed as Sisyphean at best and Luddite at worst. The paradox is this: Many tech oligarchs see everything they are doing to help us, and all their benevolent manifestos, as streetlamps on the road to a future where, as Steve Wozniak says, humans are the family pets. But Musk is not going gently. He plans on fighting this with every fiber of his carbon-based being. Musk and Altman have founded OpenAI, a billion-dollar nonprofit company, to work for safer artificial intelligence..."

A Quick Guide to Backing Up Your Critical Data. You can't back up your files enough, I've learned the hard way, especially family photos and videos. here's an excerpt from The New York Times: "...An automated backup system can preserve all the essential files, even your iTunes library, that are stored on your computer. Microsoft includes File Recovery software with Windows 10 (or Backup and Restore if the computer is running Windows 7), while Apple’s Mac operating system has had the Time Machine program for backup since 2007. For those who want more than the basic built-in backup software, third-party programs like Acronis True Image (for Windows and Mac, as well as Android and iOS) or Carbon Copy Cloner (for Mac) can grab a backup of the entire computer..."

Kudos to Chris Wallace for drilling down and challenging the new EPA Administrator, as reported at ThinkProgress: "Even Fox News can’t believe that the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, doesn’t accept the basic scientific finding that carbon dioxide is a primary contributor to recent global warming. To promote President Trump’s disastrous plan to gut EPA and U.S. climate action, Pruitt has been pushing his dangerous beliefs on all the major networks. Pruitt may have thought the Murdoch-owned network that has led the way on attacking climate science for two decades would be a friendly audience. He was wrong. Fox News Sunday anchor Chris Wallace thoroughly debunked Pruitt for defending his absurd claim that CO2 is not “a primary contributor to the global warming that we see...” MIT Climate Scientist Responds on Disaster Costs and Climate Change. Here's an excerpt from FiveThirtyEight: "...Looking ahead, I collaborated with Yale economist Robert Mendelsohn and his colleagues in estimating global hurricane damage changes through the year 2100, based on hurricanes “downscaled” from four climate models. We estimate that global hurricane damage will about double owing to demographic trends, and double again because of climate change. These projections are not inconsistent with what we’ve been seeing in hurricane data and in economic damage from hurricanes. Besides this study, there are robust theory and modeling results that show increased risk of hydrological extremes (floods and droughts) and heat-related problems. Some of these predicted trends are beginning to emerge in actuarial data. Governments, markets and ordinary people are beginning to account for the increased risk. Those who wait for actuarial trends to emerge at the 95 percent confidence level before acting do so at their peril." (Hurricane Joaquin file image: NASA). Climate Change Pushing Floods, Cyclones to New Extremes. As ocean waters continue to warm what will be the impact on cyclone (hurricane) intensity going forward? With Australia's Cyclone Debbie in mind, here's an excerpt of a post at Climate Code Red: "...The frequency of major flood events (defined as events which caused extensive flooding within 50 kilometres of the coast, or inundation that extended 20 kilometres along the coast) along Australia's eastern seaboard has doubled in last 150 years, with climate change one of the possible factors, senior Bureau of Meteorology researchers say.  Record-breaking heavy rainfall and a clear upward trend in downpours over the last 30 years fits in with global temperature rise caused by greenhouse gases. Statistical analysis of rainfall data from 1901 to 2010 around the globe, shows that from 1980 to 2010 there were 12% more of these intense events than would be expected in a climate without global warming. Wet regions generally saw a bigger increase in deluges and drier regions a smaller one. In southeast Asia, the observed increase in record-breaking rainfall events is as high as 56%..." General Electric Chief: "Climate Change is Real". Here's an excerpt from an article at MarketWatch: "General Electric Co. CEO Jeffrey Immelt defended efforts to reduce emissions and fight climate change, after President Donald Trump reversed rules that pushed U.S. utilities to use cleaner-burning fuels. In a blog post to employees Wednesday, Immelt highlighted the administration’s move and said climate change “should be addressed on a global basis through multi-national agreements” such as the 2015 Paris Agreement. The U.S. hasn’t withdrawn from that agreement, but the executive order has raised concern it will be hard to reach the pact’s targets. “We believe climate change is real and the science is well accepted,” Immelt wrote. “We hope that the United States continues to play a constructive role in furthering solutions to these challenges...” Twitter Feed.

But the cofounder and CTO of the drone delivery startup Zipline doesn’t think much of Amazon’s experiments in this area, or Google’s either. Have you been near one of those quadrocopters when it sets down, Zipline’s Keenan Wyrobek asks? “They’re huge things with the power and blade size of four lawnmowers,” he says. “They land on ground next to you, kicking up dust, and it’s not a very good experience.”  And then there’s the importance of what they’re transporting. While Amazon dropped off sunscreen for Silicon Valley insiders, and Google has talked with Domino’s about pizza delivery, Zipline is delivering life-saving blood to hospitals in Rwanda. Previously, when a blood delivery was urgently needed, someone would drive across the country with a cooler in the backseat. Often they wouldn’t make it in time. Zipline started its delivery service in Rwanda in October to solve a tough problem in a country with bad roads and rugged terrain. It’s known as the land of a thousand hills. Doctors at Rwanda’s hospitals often need blood packs to treat postpartum women who are hemorrhaging and kids with malaria-induced anemia, but shortages are all too common, especially of rare blood types. Previously, when a blood delivery was urgently needed, someone would drive across the country with a cooler in the backseat. The country’s geography didn’t make it an easy journey, particularly during the rainy seasons (Rwanda has two) when dirt roads and bridges get washed out. Too often, the driver wouldn’t make it in time to save the patient’s life. Now doctors at about a dozen hospitals can text in requests for urgently needed blood, and a Zipline drone will arrive within half an hour. The company is currently flying eight of its fixed-wing Zips from a single distribution center in Muhanga, a district about 50 kilometers west of the capital. Its drones don’t land; instead the doctor gets a text when the craft is about two minutes away and comes outside to receive a package that parachutes gently down. Zipline’s Wyrobek says the company’s engineers originally considered building delivery drones that landed at their destinations; that’s what Amazon, Google, and other drone-makers like Matternet and Flirtey have done. But he says they rejected the idea for three practical reasons: The parachute-drop system is safer for recipients, the drones don’t waste battery power on landings and takeoffs, and the whole process is faster. “Landing just doesn’t scale,” he says. “We couldn’t imagine trying to do hundreds of flights a day with landings and taking off again.” Before Zipline could start operations, it had to work with the Rwanda government to ensure that its Zips compiled with flight regulations and its procedures adhered to medical standards for blood handling. Wyrobek says government officials were eager to make the project work, seeing both health and economic benefits.  Once blood is donated, it has about a 40-day shelf life, Wyrobek explains. In that time, it has to be taken from donation sites to a central lab to be blood-typed and tested for diseases like HIV and hepatitis, then distributed to hospitals around the country. But there’s a forecasting problem: It’s hard to know where packs of rare blood types will be needed in the next few weeks. As a result, some hospitals don’t have the packs they need while other packs go unused and wasted.  Zipline solves that problem by providing immediate on-demand delivery. Its current distribution center in Muhanga will ultimately serve 21 hospitals within a radius of 75 km. Once that network is firmly established, the company will set up more distribution centers around the country in locations “where the paved roads end,” Wyrobek says. The company aims to be the primary blood supply for most of Rwanda’s hospitals. The company plans to eventually expand delivery service to small health clinics and even community health workers in remote villages. It also wants to expand its product offerings. Like blood, many vaccines and medications have to be kept cold—and in Rwanda, unexpected power cuts can turn off a clinic’s refrigerator for hours, wasting the medication inside. Zipline uses insulated packages so its products stay cold through transport and are ready for use on arrival.  If the medical delivery scheme proves itself in Rwanda, the company hopes to bring its operation to other developing countries that lack basic infrastructure like good roads and stable power supplies. Zipline is exploring its options beyond Rwanda, though Wyrobek won’t say where. (He spoke to IEEE Spectrum from an “undisclosed location” in South America.) Wyrobek and his colleagues weren’t sure how the initial Rwanda rollout would go, and worried that locals might take a negative view of the project. After all, in many parts of the world, American drones are more associated with dropping bombs than dropping medicine. But at the Muhanga distribution center, the response has been encouraging. “We still have crowds showing up every morning just to watch Zips take off and land,” Wyrobek says. “They call them sky ambulances.” Learn More Africa Amazon Google Wing Prime Air Rwanda Zipline blood delivery drones drone delivery drones malaria postpartum hemorrhage Comments Comment Policy Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a> Comments powered by Disqus Advertisement The Human OS IEEE Spectrum’s biomedical blog, featuring the wearable sensors, big data analytics, and implanted devices that enable new ventures in personalized medicine.

Android O feature spotlight: There's a cool new animation when opening or closing notifications 2017/03/30 2:10pm PDTMar 30, 2017 58 35. [Update: Notification Channels] Android O feature spotlight: Android tells you if an app is displaying a screen overlay 2017/03/31 12:05pm PDTMar 31, 2017 View All 35 Articles In This Series Android O was revealed last week, and Google talked about the neat stuff it can do via blog posts and videos. We didn't get all the little details—those nice touches that make you smile, realizing Google takes design seriously these days. Case in point, there's a rad new animation when you open and close the notification shade. Let's watch, shall we? The above video is shown at normal speed. Notice how the icons are in that bottom strip as you open the shade. Then, they slide up as the notification they are connected to is revealed. That's cool, but it looks even cooler in slow motion.   In the above video, that same animation is playing out at one-tenth speed (this is also the case for the GIF up top).  The icons sort of float across the screen to take up their position. When you close the notifications, the icons slip back down and line up. This looks a bit like a shrunken down version of the quick settings close animation. It won't fundamentally alter the experience on Android O, but it's still cool. Tags android o animations feature spotlight series_android_o_feature_spotlights video subscribe ...

You know, Nexus devices never really die... Latheryin You are missing the fact that all of Google latest code is 64 bit and the nexus 6 is 32 bit so the code is not really portable. Bewear Oh, you are right. Well, I certainly expect that some effort will be made by communities, like with ARMv6 devices. Latheryin I have spoken with many and as they are old school they know what it will entail and they have already said they are not even bothering. Many even changed devices off of the nexus 6 to the 6p because it is 64 bit. Bewear It seems I will have to jump ship soon, then, since my device is 32 bit too. Twitler What are you ? a sheap ? Don't change a Nexus at least 3-4 years.Not worth the upgrade since commnunity will take care of Nexus line better than Google ever did. Bewear The only Nexus I actually own is the Nexus 4, so I know how they can be kept alive, though it's not my main device anymore. My current device is the Moto MAXX, which is quite similar to the Nexus 6. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Rather looks like some animation glitch Martin I thought so too in the slow motion version, but thought it looked better at normal speed. Justin DiOrio Ya. Watch an actual phone video on youtube. Looks good. Dont have to pull all the way down to see what apps notified u. If u want to see what they say u scroll down and lil images r removed 1 by 1. Nd it works in reverse 2. So nice!!! SHunter That or Hangouts... Zsolt V Yes, and they should reassign all janitors and cafeteria workers to help out with the effort, too. P.s. I thought an inane comment like this would have been the top one. Surprised it's only #3. Suicide_Note Amazing. Maxr1998 Noticed it immediately after updating, made me smile ;) Love the attention to detail that Google is showing here! MicroNix All it does is add extra work for the SOC m477 Yeah, they should ditch the GUI altogether. Everything more than a command line is waste of resources. Ryan Idiotic argument by an idiot. A little detail that nobody but a nerd is going to notice /= the entire UI. m477 Many details that "nobody but a nerd is going to notice" make a nice and polished UI. If you consider them useless waste of resources, you can turn off animations from developer settings. Nicholas Conrad Zomg, how about putting dev resources to anything else? Kehnin Dyer ui guys are BORED Nick Coad I think commenters here frequently seem to have a strange view of how software gets developed. Like people seem to think that you have 20 devs (for example) and they sit and work 100% on a single animation for four days or something. There are so many things wrong with that. Leonardo Baez This.. My god, how people can be so limited in their vision? Henry Park Because a lot of people don't know how developing software works let alone taken a programming class Leonardo Baez It's​ just common sense... Most people seems to dont have it. Henry Park fact that most people seem to not know implies it is not common sense to average human being. Ryan Umm, you dont have to be a code expert to know resource planning. Even if its ONE dev spending 3 logged hours on this its 3 logged hours that could have been spent actually making something useful or fixing a bug. And wait, theres more! Lets assume there are all kinds of pointless animations and eggs that are in O that will likely eventually be nixed because they are pointless, if everyone just diverted all of their time from that to something useful imagine what could be done! AndroidUser00110001 Different kind of coders... Nick Coad The person who does UI development is not the same person who does the OS level stuff, I don't know how to explain this any clearer. Nick Coad And by the way I never said anyone needed to be a code expert, I said nothing of the sort. I agree that anyone should be able to understand that this frequently found distortion of software development is wrong. NothingUnknown It was either this or another messaging app. Take your pick. PVL_93_RU Looks kinda iffy, like the icons lag behind the shade Leonardo Baez 1/10th of real speed on the videos... In real speed you will not even notice Peter Leung I didn't notice this. I used android o for a week. Good_Ole_Pinocchio I have the new Pixel Launcher on my 6p and the "bounce" animation the Icons in these videos show, happens to the app drawer shade when I unlock the phone. Not sure how long that's been there but I just noticed it. Almost like it's saying "Hey, you can swipe up here" Abhishek Das https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/442cfb7a3fd2ab0deba7f11a64708d1a81c49b54f98d7b2e82ca4673541370df.jpg 😆😄 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d854815208e8ebd194c840a407251882b40ee69f742aa280a190fa9353c47ebe.png m477 Please stop. Avishek Stahp Konrad Krawczuk I hope its some kind of animation glitch. Looks absolutely awful. Minimalism is the key... Miguel Angel No! It's time to have overly complicated animations once again. Our phones are powerful enough. We have the technology ! Vivek Rameses Yeah, that is god awful. Probably a bug. Latheryin So this is what they work on while the OS has tons of issues that are far more pressing. Way to go Google. With how pointless it is there is no mistaking it came from the Google design team that I and many others are confident are pretty much blind. So yeah makes sense. Nick Coad I don't get your complaint, do you think the same people who fix low level OS bugs are working on UI animations? Is that what you actually believe? Latheryin I Believe in team work. If one fails they all fail. And the UI people have their own epic fails as of late. Nick Coad I don't understand how that's relevant to what you posted. You seem to think that this animation somehow means the OS issues are being ignored, but in reality those things are developed by different groups of people. It's like people think that they have a list of tasks and they set the entire team on each task one after the other. That's just not how it works, they will be simultaneously working on lots of shit at once across the whole team. Latheryin And it goes to show how bad that fails. Too many cooks in kitchen. They are being ignored. Just look at the shut down issue for all nexus and pixel devices after 7.0. You must never have worked on a multi-team project. Had you, then you would know that it doesn't matter what team fails. If one does the whole project fails. mchalakov I'm interested in the fails that the "UI people" did recently? Latheryin Quick tiles (waste of space) material design (text book juvenile colors) tool bars at the top of the device when they are only getting bigger. Should I keep going. Matthew Gardner That's an amazing non-response you just gave. Ever considered a career in politics? Latheryin Politics? No thanks. I have self honor. So not an option. It was an answer. It doesn't matter what part of the project fails. Give them a by because it wasn't there team is the same as a participating trophy. Both are BS. Martin Of course, how else would it work? On an unrelated note, I yelled at a gardener today. What the heck is he doing planting flowers, when he could be out fighting crime?! Ryan Leadership pays them. Hire one less "notification shade animation dev" and one more "fixing broken shit" dev. Its like a baker that never has enough of one type of cookie but tons of another type of cookie. This problem was always solvable, you just needed to plan for it. Nick Coad You're still not making any sense: there is NO reason to hire one less UI dev, that dev is not responsible for bugs not getting fixed in the OS, they are UNRELATED. And by the way you're assuming that this is a problem (and by the way, I'm still not sure what specific bugs are being talked about here) that can be fixed by simply throwing more resources at it. In reality the world is a lot more complex than just "let's throw more devs at it." Read "The Mythical Man Month" for a good introduction to why that way of thinking just doesn't work. Nick Coad They need to slow down the speed just a tiny amount, but other than that it's a great effect. Filipe Santos Okay, now stop Google, it's too much dblock Anyone else think this doesn't look clean at all? Something about the icon beginning beneath the notification text just doesn't look good to me. Lord Argyris It's interesting how the overshoot the icons do when sliding into position isn't obvious until you see it in slow motion. I imagine if they didn't do that, the animation would look unnatural, with the icons seemingly "sticking" upon ending up in their respective notifications. A real object that moved like that and landed somewhere would bounce a bit, and so do these icons. Attention to detail--that was what Material Design was all about before we started chasing after circular icon windmills and endless UI churn. Ploppy Why would you animate something on top of something else... Nick Coad I don't even know how to respond to this. Ploppy I don't know ANY product that animates small elements with transparent background. Do you? Ploppy Usually you animate either something big, such as an entire window, or something alone in a container. You never animate small elements with random shapes and transparent background over some text. Ploppy It was 2am I should have write this differently lol. ericshmerick Gimmick gonna get old quick. Naxx ENVY kinda like this comment BBpost Did they finally fix the issue where you get a notification beep about archiving a gmail or dismissing an exchange notification? It's really annoying when you clear out a dozen notifications and then get 12 instant notification beeps for notifications that instantly disappear. mchalakov Don't put too much thinking in this. It's just a simple animation to make someone(who notice it) smile. You know easter egg style ;) Willie Chalmers III I'm a bit indifferent to the animation change. I like the fact it's there, but maybe it's more suited to being a fade in of some kind. This doesn't feel too much like material design. Burak Çalık Its actually very good, but slow-motion view makes it look bad. mattcoz Agreed, looks terrible because the icon moves over the text. Luckily at full speed that isn't noticeable. instinct I think the opposite. We should argue about this. Ramon Add more lag to the OS. Real nice Google. Optimize more first. MeCampbell30 Looks better in slow motion to me. Looks kinda janky at regular speed. instinct I thought the same thing, It's too fast where it almost just seems to appear as if it took time to load. Fernando Pena I would never notice that if it wasn't for this post. That animation is SO FAST. I can barely see it... Mr. Spock It looks more like a bug than a feature. brolivar I could watch this all day DragoCubed It looks so good in slow motion but in real time it's simply too fast. Tahir firoz Wow 217 applications updated klaus muster ApK teardown please Car Parking Car Parking Driving Simulator is a fantastic game! It’s the best way to understand all the rules of driving and also get to exercise them interesting, however only ten challenges that we did not find everything difficult.

It looks like a childs idea. Just because you can animate it, doesn't mean you should. Cakefish I like! Fitzelgard Allan Gerard Dearest Google, Slower, you slut. thunderqus I hate it that icons are so colourful when tray is pulled but not in tray itself. wallace This will requires a new GPU tweak ... an easy way to drop more than half of existing smartphones. Ryan There are hundreds of bug reports, probably two dozen in bluetooth alone and THIS is what they spend resources on? hoooooookkkkaaayyy create812 It's been said that, while Android looks better in screenshots, iOS looks better in motion. I'm glad Android team is focusing on some more movement animations. This one needs some tuning, but I'm a fan already. Sean Thomas fun fact animation designers aren't going to be fixing bugs. They can work on more than one thing at a time. This looks great. It definitely makes the notification shade feel more connected to the rest of android. IDK what people are talking about with the whole "looking like a glitch" thing. Chris As long as I can turn it off to save battery life Fernando Pena You can always turn off animations. blindexecutioner That will be nice eye candy for all the persistent notifications that are probably going to be forced on us. It will probably stutter all the time though. Nothing ever turns out that smooth in Android. BC I'm in love with this little touches and it makes me happy that Android O is going to focus on that...I am sad as most major OEMs won't update to this version quickly enough to make my excitement peak. poop. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f0e5837bf0818abfa0fd3ba8b7123b80d5c20c448cc919e68f9864ecc8df61c6.jpg Preben Nielsen I would choose ... not to have it.

Daydream VR support is absent on the Galaxy S8 and S8+ Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/02 1:56pm PDTApr 2, 2017 42 Plus 1 on G+ 88 Share on Facebook 57 Share on Twitter Total Shares187 Galaxy S8 News Samsung Google initially spearheaded virtual reality on Android with Google Cardboard, which evolved into the more complete Daydream VR platform. Unlike Cardboard, which could start on any somewhat-recent Android or iOS device, Daydream support requires the phone manufacturer and Google to make sure everything works. Unfortunately, it looks like the Samsung isn't supporting Daydream VR on the new Galaxy S8 and S8+. According to VRHeads, trying to install the Daydream app will result in an error message. This could be due to a previous agreement with Oculus (which helped develop the Gear VR), but there's also a strong possibility that Samsung just doesn't care to support it. Admittedly, Daydream VR doesn't have very much content, and Samsung's own Gear VR platform has plenty of apps and games. Still, it's annoying to see that the already-minuscule mobile VR market is fragmented.

Kappa saf1927 What is VR again? Ah, some shit that everyone likes to experience once and then realises it's shit. Morten Ulv I must have missed the part where it's shit. Kevin It was actually cool. It really tricks your brain, but I had the opportunity to play a game in an open space. Only thing bad was the actual gameplay. Nothing like COD George Byers Seems that the only way to get Samsung to support anything Google is to make it compulsory in order to get access to the play store 😒 Willie Chalmers III You knew just what I was thinking. If Google included another no-compete clause in the GMS partner agreement for VR-related platforms, Daydream could finally solidify itself as the Android platform for VR. (Although, Samsung and Oculus could easily sue that Google is abusing their market share and all the other crap we have seen before for requiring partners to preload Google apps.) MicroNix And you think that would be fair when it was Samsung that was to market much earlier with VR than Google? Whiskey Tango Foxtrot.

Samsung Gear VR is and has been far better for ages. Good_Ole_Pinocchio No need to support Daydream. There's zero benefit to Samsung. MJ Yes, customer needs are of no concern to Samsung also like updates. billy routh Samsung has their own VR and it's Miles ahead of Google's crappy daydream. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Of all customer needs, DayDream support is absolute last on that list. No need for it. They want VR? They'll get a freeheadset JohnyNoLegs Lol samsung VR??? And who needs breaking updates. AsterMK Daydream is far from a need. It's a want, and barely anyone wants VR in general. Of those that do want it, almost everyone prefers Gear VR. YaKillaCJ Not surprising and to be expected. The general public see Samsung TouchWiz/GraceUx as Android itself. Google lost control a long time ago. Kwetsima Maluleke Not a lose. Oculus just has so much more to offer here. Morten Ulv And name one service that Samsung provice that's better than what Google offer. That's right there are none. Daydream may not be much now, but it has much more promise than Gear VR. Dominick White so people should wait until Google gets better, or go with Samsung that is know to work very well? Morten Ulv It would obviously have both. This would be like Nvidia only supporting Oculus and not Vive. They only chose to not support it, because, fuck consumers. I'm not saying it's unexpected, or that it won't work. Because Samsung obviously has a lot of power here, and VR is not a main selling point for these phones. MicroNix When Samsung is giving away a GearVR with every S8 purchase, there's not a lot of incentive to support a smaller, questionable as to how long it will be around because its Google, VR platform. Morten Ulv Samsung will not give away a GearVR with every S8, you must be dreaming. Perhaps as a time limited and location limited promotional offer. EcE It is at launch but they also do it every high season (black Friday, back to school, etc) and there are promotions quite often. As much as I would like to use some cardboard apps/videos on my s7 (and obviously daydream) there's zero incentive for Samsung to support it. And like a lot of people here, I wouldn't be surprised if Google would just ditch it in a couple of years JohnyNoLegs Gear VR was before Daydream, google decided to add another one to the group. MicroNix Until Google gets tired of it and stops active support of it. Are you new to Google products or something? Dubs816 Name one service that Samsung provides that's better than what Google offers? Let's see... ever heard of Samsung Pay? The service that works in tens of thousands of places Android Pay doesn't? JohnyNoLegs Man it's too late, typical google. Copy Samsung years down the road then expect everyone to pick it up. Gear VR is already established and has a user base. DragoCubed Samsung pay. Kwetsima Maluleke Android TV? Android Pay? The Samsung counterparts are better. Kwetsima Maluleke And you delusional if you think the Daydream VR will catch up to the Gear VR. Whether its sales or content. Nathan J You can root for Oculus if you want, but you have to accept and be transparent about the fact that it's owned and controlled by Facebook. Oculus founder Palmer Luckey has left. What you mean is that Facebook has so much more to offer. The major players in the VR space are Valve (HTC Vive), Facebook (Oculus Rift), and Google (Daydream). I won't deny that Facebook is in the lead here, but I have no intention of supporting them against the other two. I personally like Daydream, since it uses phones. I hope Apple doesn't develop their own thing, and just works with Google (as they have on search, and Google apps working so well on iOS). Daydream being multi-platform would be huge. Jordon De La Cruz Does the s8 fit into the previous gear VR? Kwetsima Maluleke Nope. Only the new one. fredric If Samsung had to choose between Oculos or Google's Daydream, it a no brainier to choose Oculos since they're mostly the acknowledged pioneers in this field. The really​ important question is, are they truly forced into choosing only one of them?? My first thought when I saw their new GearVR set with a controller was Daydream support. They're either working towards supporting it, or just a good feature they can't ignore. In either case (and my opinion, at least), almost nothing is still worth getting a VR headset for (including Vive and the Rift) but would still be interested into trying it for its reasonable price. Leif Sikorski That's not a big suprise I think. GearVR feels much more responsive than Daydream so it makes sense to focus on the new GearVR instead of Daydream which was very late in the game. Samsung and Oculus stand behind their VR solution since years while Google hasn't done much yet and is known for quickly quitting such things. Christopher Bailey (Xcom923) Is anyone surprised by this news? AbbyZFresh Does it really matter? Developers seem to be supporting and releasing apps for GearVR more than they've been doing for DayDream. shonangreg Can I use Gear VR on my non-Samsung phones? No? Then it is doomed. When one or two competitors are good enough and available across devices (and platforms), then VR app makers will go to them (and Samsung might open Gear VR to prevent this also). There is no reason to play this stupid vendor lock-in game with VR headsets. AbbyZFresh I would agree with you except for the following factors. 1. Samsung alone sells more phones(especially VR-compatible high end phones) than all the other following Andorid brands combined. Which means Samsung has the most exposure. 2. Gear VR is supported by Oculus, which means it will always have relevance since the two platforms are increasingly linked. 3. Samsung is actively pushing VR with their phones pushing demos for people to try. Couldn't find any places to demo Daydream. shonangreg I don't think you're right on point #1. Samsung has about 20% of the worldwide smartphone market, and android is about 85% of that: http://www.idc.com/promo/smartphone-market-share/vendor So just off the top of my head, Samsung has maybe 30% of the android market. Point #2: I didn't know that. If they're making Gear VR cross platform like that, then it would be way more worthwhile. X-47B You need context in everything. #1: Samsung alone sells more phones(especially VR-compatible high end phones). S/He's right in that saying Samsung leads VR-compatible phone sales. Gear VR had shipped around 5 million in 2016, more than every other brands combined. Joshua Hill Can I use daydream on the G6 or any other non pixel flagship??? No then it's doomed lol Dominick White well to be honest it's kinda supported on axon 7 Joshua Hill My bad, now that i've actually checked some moto z phones have daydream support too. Allegedly if you root your phone and insert a single line of code any device is daydream compatible including the S8. JohnyNoLegs Could I use VR on any Nexus phone prior to Daydream? No FAIL. Also Gear VR is still better than Daydream, and has more games and support. Samsung actually support VR...unlike google... Joshua Hill dude you replied to the wrong person or your comprehension sucks!!! lol I was pointing out how ridiculous shonangreg's comment was and how his arguments against gear vr could also be applied to daydream. Oops!!!!!! hahaha JohnyNoLegs Fair enough but it wasn't immediately obvious, considering that Samsung don't support daydream is actually kinda stupid. But yes ignore me then. ShahinTr Utterly convenient.. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/60efae9a00168334a9c265167f8a740795662842c4f1394c015eb51fd1b99d36.jpg MicroNix Which was first, Gear VR or Daydream? Which do you think will be around the longest, something from Samsung or something from Google? There, that should put things into perspective for you. ShahinTr Dude. Jeez. It's a meme. Just go with it. Please. MicroNix Its just an overused term in Android. TannoV It's also a true term. Mert Oculus Store has many options. But anyway, my Gear VR is waiting me with a lots of dusts on it. That technology is going to die if someone won't come with a solid idea. Good_Ole_Pinocchio I mean there are solid ideas. That doesn't mean people actually want it though. Good ideas don't always sell. Mert I can't say whole store is garbage but still VR tech looking desperately for it's own Angry Birds. Good_Ole_Pinocchio I think everyday people would want more Triple A titles that aren't games. Less games and more pushing life like experiences will help bring folks onboard. Then the next step should be having these experiences at the same time with Friends and family. Not a "My turn ,your turn" set up that we have now. Jose Romero Good, this will only make Google work harder to make Daydream a success and to improve it. Vivek Rameses Good. Jon Fridman VR is a little pointless on smartphones. I'd understand buying a HTC Vive or Oculus VR for your PC not for a phone. I've tried the Google Daydream for the Pixel XL and Samsung Gear VR, neither are what I'd call good. I'd rather use my desktop for VR or nothing. Phones aren't up to par with what VR needs yet. I think using a phone hurts the public image of what VR is truly capable of. senor_heisenberg Eh, neither platform is particularly worthwhile. That said, I'll always prefer to have​ the one that's not tied to a single OEM's hardware. Joshua Hill At the moment they both are lol Grey "It's annoying to see that the already-minuscule mobile VR market is fragmented." I agree on that, but you have to agree that Google can't own everything, and that companies shouldn't allow Google to own everything, or go along with Google on all of its ideas. It's like Steam. Would it be easier if all PC games were on Steam and I didn't need anything more? Sure. Would it be better for the market? No. Me Not really surprising Kenny One the one hand, it's nice to have options. On the other hand, if Google tries to require Daydream support as a prerequisit for certification, then it might end up being another Microsoft case of using the platform to force dorminance. Then again, it's also nice to not have fragmentation. Life is so difficult ... :/ Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Be together, not the same. Differentiation means competition, which is a good thing. Joshua Hill Competition is bad when it means a potential lack of content. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's only bad for the loser of the competition. But that's why competition is good. The best thing wins out. Joshua Hill Ah no. It's bad for the consumer who cannot acquire the content they desire on their platform as well. How did you not get the point??? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You don't understand competition, then. Remember Betamax? It lost. So people stopped caring about content on Betamax. Same thing here. May the best VR win, and then all the content will go there. Joshua Hill Are we talking about today or some unspecified future date you have in your head??? The future is irrelevant as neither of these formats will survive in their current iterations. Consumers will have to buy a new VR I do remember betamax and I bet those users who owned VHS's but couldn't buy the content they wanted because it was exclusive to Betamax would comprehend my point. You do understand that this sort of competition breeds exclusive content. Going back to my initial comment which you seem not to comprehend, this leads to a 'potential lack of content' for the consumer. This means the consumer loses too. Joshua Hill I'm not saying competition is all bad. You claimed it was good and I provided an example of how it can also be bad for the consumer. If you can't comprehend this and discuss the issue I've raised there's really no point continuing the conversation. pfmiller There's a big difference between this and a format war between two physically incompatible storage mediums like VHS and Betamax. There's no reason why a modern phone can't support both Daydream and Gear VR. Joshua Hill Be together implies that competing formats should be supported on all phones that have the hardware capabilities to do so. This is more a case of 'Go it alone, we're all different anyways' ;) Wilton Daniel Pinto VR has no future. Duh😪 dhamp2g This is some bull. I bought a dream while it was on sale bc I thought this phone support dream, ROB Since when has Samsung ever stood for support... can you imagine how long it would take to get an update for the program... hell I am still waiting for 7.0 ast00 VR on phones is pointless. But still... Why? Because Samsung . Kevin Davis Is anyone actually surprised? kalehv Is it just me that owns a pixel, has a free daydream viewer but doesn't even care to dust it off? Margaritas Ante Porcos lol Samsung is digging its grave. Everyday something bad comes up about on s8. tim242 Haha you have been smoking some bad shit. Joshua Hill Can i have some of what you're on??? I'm not a samsung fan, I'm prolly getting an S8 but my last sammy was an S2. I'd like to hear the drug induced reasoning to your claim lol Margaritas Ante Porcos You comment is rude. At your age you should know how to communicate without rudeness, shouldn't you? Joshua Hill If you are going to spread malicious misinformation and not substantiate it you should be used to rude replies! Margaritas Ante Porcos And yet you are continuing being impolite. Obviously, you've got personal reasons to disrespect absolute strangers on the web. After all the world is spinning around your corrosive little ego, isn't it? I don't find it entertaining to feed your unhealthy appetite for ridiculing others. So, bite me. Joshua Hill My 2nd response was not impolite at all it was a simple opinion or statement of the facts as I see it. Would you care to discuss the crux of the issue. I'm still awaiting for you to substantiate the original claim you made which i consider malicious and factually incorrect! 'Everyday something bad', you must have an awfully long list of bad things about the S8 that have been revealed and yet so far you have provided none! Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Just like Android Wear vs. Samsung Gear watches... very very annoying! "But they said in the store my watch is 100% Android compatible" As an Android Wear developer I get this question on a daily basis (even though I try to make it clear in the app description and inside the app too). It is extremely confusing to regular people. Now the same all over again with VR.

Daydream VR support is absent on the Galaxy S8 and S8+ Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/02 1:56pm PDTApr 2, 2017 42 Plus 1 on G+ 88 Share on Facebook 57 Share on Twitter Total Shares187 Galaxy S8 News Samsung Google initially spearheaded virtual reality on Android with Google Cardboard, which evolved into the more complete Daydream VR platform. Unlike Cardboard, which could start on any somewhat-recent Android or iOS device, Daydream support requires the phone manufacturer and Google to make sure everything works. Unfortunately, it looks like the Samsung isn't supporting Daydream VR on the new Galaxy S8 and S8+. According to VRHeads, trying to install the Daydream app will result in an error message. This could be due to a previous agreement with Oculus (which helped develop the Gear VR), but there's also a strong possibility that Samsung just doesn't care to support it. Admittedly, Daydream VR doesn't have very much content, and Samsung's own Gear VR platform has plenty of apps and games. Still, it's annoying to see that the already-minuscule mobile VR market is fragmented.

It really tricks your brain, but I had the opportunity to play a game in an open space. Only thing bad was the actual gameplay. Nothing like COD George Byers Seems that the only way to get Samsung to support anything Google is to make it compulsory in order to get access to the play store 😒 Willie Chalmers III You knew just what I was thinking. If Google included another no-compete clause in the GMS partner agreement for VR-related platforms, Daydream could finally solidify itself as the Android platform for VR. (Although, Samsung and Oculus could easily sue that Google is abusing their market share and all the other crap we have seen before for requiring partners to preload Google apps.) MicroNix And you think that would be fair when it was Samsung that was to market much earlier with VR than Google? Whiskey Tango Foxtrot.

Samsung Gear VR is and has been far better for ages. Good_Ole_Pinocchio No need to support Daydream. There's zero benefit to Samsung. MJ Yes, customer needs are of no concern to Samsung also like updates. billy routh Samsung has their own VR and it's Miles ahead of Google's crappy daydream. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Of all customer needs, DayDream support is absolute last on that list. No need for it. They want VR? They'll get a freeheadset JohnyNoLegs Lol samsung VR??? And who needs breaking updates. AsterMK Daydream is far from a need. It's a want, and barely anyone wants VR in general. Of those that do want it, almost everyone prefers Gear VR. YaKillaCJ Not surprising and to be expected. The general public see Samsung TouchWiz/GraceUx as Android itself. Google lost control a long time ago. Kwetsima Maluleke Not a lose. Oculus just has so much more to offer here. Morten Ulv And name one service that Samsung provice that's better than what Google offer. That's right there are none. Daydream may not be much now, but it has much more promise than Gear VR. Dominick White so people should wait until Google gets better, or go with Samsung that is know to work very well? Morten Ulv It would obviously have both. This would be like Nvidia only supporting Oculus and not Vive. They only chose to not support it, because, fuck consumers. I'm not saying it's unexpected, or that it won't work. Because Samsung obviously has a lot of power here, and VR is not a main selling point for these phones. MicroNix When Samsung is giving away a GearVR with every S8 purchase, there's not a lot of incentive to support a smaller, questionable as to how long it will be around because its Google, VR platform. Morten Ulv Samsung will not give away a GearVR with every S8, you must be dreaming. Perhaps as a time limited and location limited promotional offer. EcE It is at launch but they also do it every high season (black Friday, back to school, etc) and there are promotions quite often. As much as I would like to use some cardboard apps/videos on my s7 (and obviously daydream) there's zero incentive for Samsung to support it. And like a lot of people here, I wouldn't be surprised if Google would just ditch it in a couple of years JohnyNoLegs Gear VR was before Daydream, google decided to add another one to the group. MicroNix Until Google gets tired of it and stops active support of it. Are you new to Google products or something? Dubs816 Name one service that Samsung provides that's better than what Google offers? Let's see... ever heard of Samsung Pay? The service that works in tens of thousands of places Android Pay doesn't? JohnyNoLegs Man it's too late, typical google. Copy Samsung years down the road then expect everyone to pick it up. Gear VR is already established and has a user base. DragoCubed Samsung pay. Kwetsima Maluleke Android TV? Android Pay? The Samsung counterparts are better. Kwetsima Maluleke And you delusional if you think the Daydream VR will catch up to the Gear VR. Whether its sales or content. Nathan J You can root for Oculus if you want, but you have to accept and be transparent about the fact that it's owned and controlled by Facebook. Oculus founder Palmer Luckey has left. What you mean is that Facebook has so much more to offer. The major players in the VR space are Valve (HTC Vive), Facebook (Oculus Rift), and Google (Daydream). I won't deny that Facebook is in the lead here, but I have no intention of supporting them against the other two. I personally like Daydream, since it uses phones. I hope Apple doesn't develop their own thing, and just works with Google (as they have on search, and Google apps working so well on iOS). Daydream being multi-platform would be huge. Jordon De La Cruz Does the s8 fit into the previous gear VR? Kwetsima Maluleke Nope. Only the new one. fredric If Samsung had to choose between Oculos or Google's Daydream, it a no brainier to choose Oculos since they're mostly the acknowledged pioneers in this field. The really​ important question is, are they truly forced into choosing only one of them?? My first thought when I saw their new GearVR set with a controller was Daydream support. They're either working towards supporting it, or just a good feature they can't ignore. In either case (and my opinion, at least), almost nothing is still worth getting a VR headset for (including Vive and the Rift) but would still be interested into trying it for its reasonable price. Leif Sikorski That's not a big suprise I think. GearVR feels much more responsive than Daydream so it makes sense to focus on the new GearVR instead of Daydream which was very late in the game. Samsung and Oculus stand behind their VR solution since years while Google hasn't done much yet and is known for quickly quitting such things. Christopher Bailey (Xcom923) Is anyone surprised by this news? AbbyZFresh Does it really matter? Developers seem to be supporting and releasing apps for GearVR more than they've been doing for DayDream. shonangreg Can I use Gear VR on my non-Samsung phones? No? Then it is doomed. When one or two competitors are good enough and available across devices (and platforms), then VR app makers will go to them (and Samsung might open Gear VR to prevent this also). There is no reason to play this stupid vendor lock-in game with VR headsets. AbbyZFresh I would agree with you except for the following factors. 1. Samsung alone sells more phones(especially VR-compatible high end phones) than all the other following Andorid brands combined. Which means Samsung has the most exposure. 2. Gear VR is supported by Oculus, which means it will always have relevance since the two platforms are increasingly linked. 3. Samsung is actively pushing VR with their phones pushing demos for people to try. Couldn't find any places to demo Daydream. shonangreg I don't think you're right on point #1. Samsung has about 20% of the worldwide smartphone market, and android is about 85% of that: http://www.idc.com/promo/smartphone-market-share/vendor So just off the top of my head, Samsung has maybe 30% of the android market. Point #2: I didn't know that. If they're making Gear VR cross platform like that, then it would be way more worthwhile. X-47B You need context in everything. #1: Samsung alone sells more phones(especially VR-compatible high end phones). S/He's right in that saying Samsung leads VR-compatible phone sales. Gear VR had shipped around 5 million in 2016, more than every other brands combined. Joshua Hill Can I use daydream on the G6 or any other non pixel flagship??? No then it's doomed lol Dominick White well to be honest it's kinda supported on axon 7 Joshua Hill My bad, now that i've actually checked some moto z phones have daydream support too. Allegedly if you root your phone and insert a single line of code any device is daydream compatible including the S8. JohnyNoLegs Could I use VR on any Nexus phone prior to Daydream? No FAIL. Also Gear VR is still better than Daydream, and has more games and support. Samsung actually support VR...unlike google... Joshua Hill dude you replied to the wrong person or your comprehension sucks!!! lol I was pointing out how ridiculous shonangreg's comment was and how his arguments against gear vr could also be applied to daydream. Oops!!!!!! hahaha JohnyNoLegs Fair enough but it wasn't immediately obvious, considering that Samsung don't support daydream is actually kinda stupid. But yes ignore me then. ShahinTr Utterly convenient.. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/60efae9a00168334a9c265167f8a740795662842c4f1394c015eb51fd1b99d36.jpg MicroNix Which was first, Gear VR or Daydream? Which do you think will be around the longest, something from Samsung or something from Google? There, that should put things into perspective for you. ShahinTr Dude. Jeez. It's a meme. Just go with it. Please. MicroNix Its just an overused term in Android. TannoV It's also a true term. Mert Oculus Store has many options. But anyway, my Gear VR is waiting me with a lots of dusts on it. That technology is going to die if someone won't come with a solid idea. Good_Ole_Pinocchio I mean there are solid ideas. That doesn't mean people actually want it though. Good ideas don't always sell. Mert I can't say whole store is garbage but still VR tech looking desperately for it's own Angry Birds. Good_Ole_Pinocchio I think everyday people would want more Triple A titles that aren't games. Less games and more pushing life like experiences will help bring folks onboard. Then the next step should be having these experiences at the same time with Friends and family. Not a "My turn ,your turn" set up that we have now. Jose Romero Good, this will only make Google work harder to make Daydream a success and to improve it. Vivek Rameses Good. Jon Fridman VR is a little pointless on smartphones. I'd understand buying a HTC Vive or Oculus VR for your PC not for a phone. I've tried the Google Daydream for the Pixel XL and Samsung Gear VR, neither are what I'd call good. I'd rather use my desktop for VR or nothing. Phones aren't up to par with what VR needs yet. I think using a phone hurts the public image of what VR is truly capable of. senor_heisenberg Eh, neither platform is particularly worthwhile. That said, I'll always prefer to have​ the one that's not tied to a single OEM's hardware. Joshua Hill At the moment they both are lol Grey "It's annoying to see that the already-minuscule mobile VR market is fragmented." I agree on that, but you have to agree that Google can't own everything, and that companies shouldn't allow Google to own everything, or go along with Google on all of its ideas. It's like Steam. Would it be easier if all PC games were on Steam and I didn't need anything more? Sure. Would it be better for the market? No. Me Not really surprising Kenny One the one hand, it's nice to have options. On the other hand, if Google tries to require Daydream support as a prerequisit for certification, then it might end up being another Microsoft case of using the platform to force dorminance. Then again, it's also nice to not have fragmentation. Life is so difficult ... :/ Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Be together, not the same. Differentiation means competition, which is a good thing. Joshua Hill Competition is bad when it means a potential lack of content. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's only bad for the loser of the competition. But that's why competition is good. The best thing wins out. Joshua Hill Ah no. It's bad for the consumer who cannot acquire the content they desire on their platform as well. How did you not get the point??? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You don't understand competition, then. Remember Betamax? It lost. So people stopped caring about content on Betamax. Same thing here. May the best VR win, and then all the content will go there. Joshua Hill Are we talking about today or some unspecified future date you have in your head??? The future is irrelevant as neither of these formats will survive in their current iterations. Consumers will have to buy a new VR I do remember betamax and I bet those users who owned VHS's but couldn't buy the content they wanted because it was exclusive to Betamax would comprehend my point. You do understand that this sort of competition breeds exclusive content. Going back to my initial comment which you seem not to comprehend, this leads to a 'potential lack of content' for the consumer. This means the consumer loses too. Joshua Hill I'm not saying competition is all bad. You claimed it was good and I provided an example of how it can also be bad for the consumer. If you can't comprehend this and discuss the issue I've raised there's really no point continuing the conversation. pfmiller There's a big difference between this and a format war between two physically incompatible storage mediums like VHS and Betamax. There's no reason why a modern phone can't support both Daydream and Gear VR. Joshua Hill Be together implies that competing formats should be supported on all phones that have the hardware capabilities to do so. This is more a case of 'Go it alone, we're all different anyways' ;) Wilton Daniel Pinto VR has no future. Duh😪 dhamp2g This is some bull. I bought a dream while it was on sale bc I thought this phone support dream, ROB Since when has Samsung ever stood for support... can you imagine how long it would take to get an update for the program... hell I am still waiting for 7.0 ast00 VR on phones is pointless. But still... Why? Because Samsung . Kevin Davis Is anyone actually surprised? kalehv Is it just me that owns a pixel, has a free daydream viewer but doesn't even care to dust it off? Margaritas Ante Porcos lol Samsung is digging its grave. Everyday something bad comes up about on s8. tim242 Haha you have been smoking some bad shit. Joshua Hill Can i have some of what you're on??? I'm not a samsung fan, I'm prolly getting an S8 but my last sammy was an S2. I'd like to hear the drug induced reasoning to your claim lol Margaritas Ante Porcos You comment is rude. At your age you should know how to communicate without rudeness, shouldn't you? Joshua Hill If you are going to spread malicious misinformation and not substantiate it you should be used to rude replies! Margaritas Ante Porcos And yet you are continuing being impolite. Obviously, you've got personal reasons to disrespect absolute strangers on the web. After all the world is spinning around your corrosive little ego, isn't it? I don't find it entertaining to feed your unhealthy appetite for ridiculing others. So, bite me. Joshua Hill My 2nd response was not impolite at all it was a simple opinion or statement of the facts as I see it. Would you care to discuss the crux of the issue. I'm still awaiting for you to substantiate the original claim you made which i consider malicious and factually incorrect! 'Everyday something bad', you must have an awfully long list of bad things about the S8 that have been revealed and yet so far you have provided none! Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Just like Android Wear vs. Samsung Gear watches... very very annoying! "But they said in the store my watch is 100% Android compatible" As an Android Wear developer I get this question on a daily basis (even though I try to make it clear in the app description and inside the app too). It is extremely confusing to regular people. Now the same all over again with VR.

News sign-up Tech giants pledge to tackle extremism News, 03 April 2017 LONDON: Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Twitter have promised to work together to combat online extremist content and terrorist propaganda, following a meeting with the British Home Secretary. Senior executives from the tech companies met Amber Rudd last Thursday, along with representatives from some smaller firms, to discuss collective measures against those who seek to do harm, Bloomberg reported. The meeting came just a week after Khalid Masood's murderous car and knife rampage on the streets of London that left four people dead, including an unarmed policeman who was guarding Parliament. Amber Rudd had also used an interview a few days earlier with the BBC to insist the police and intelligence agencies should have access to Facebook-owned WhatsApp and other encrypted messaging services. She said it was "completely unacceptable" for the authorities to be unable to read messages protected by end-to-end encryption. Following her meeting with Google and the other tech companies, they promised to explore options for a cross-industry forum and to "urgently improve" their collaboration on technical tools to identify and remove terrorist propaganda. "Our companies are committed to making our platforms a hostile space for those who seek to do harm, and we have been working on this issue for several years," the companies said in a joint statement. "We share the government's commitment to ensuring terrorists do not have a voice online." Meanwhile, Amber Rudd said: "In taking forward this work I’d like to see the industry to go further and faster in not only removing online terrorist content but stopping it going up in the first place. "I'd also like to see more support for smaller and emerging platforms to do this as well, so they can no longer be seen as an alternative shop floor by those who want to do us harm." The summit held at the highest levels of the British government comes as Google, in particular, continues to be criticised over its placement of ads on extremist and other inappropriate sites. The ongoing controversy also extends to wider concerns about transparency and trust in the digital advertising ecosystem, and this has prompted the CEO of the Internet Advertising Bureau (UK) to add his voice. Writing in The Drum, the IAB's Jon Mew stated that there are some simple principles that the industry should apply to digital that could "make a massive difference" to the issues being faced while also making the channel more effective. He said the industry must stop serving ads that annoy people and he referred to updated guidance that the Coalition for Better Ads published very recently. Mew also criticised some advertisers for the way they use metrics, arguing that they should stop chasing click-through rates and instead focus on "pushing towards measuring long-term uplifts in brand perceptions and sales". Finally, he reminded advertisers of the importance of using third-party verification, such as the guidance offered by JICWEBS, a joint industry committee.

The Mountain View giant is bringing the service’s features to Google Maps on mobile and desktop. The company is also encouraging users to join the Local Guides program. Last Friday, Google announced that Map Maker has officially closed and most of the editing service’s features are being integrated into Google Maps. The tech giant also promised that new editing features will be added to Google Maps on an ongoing basis.  Map Maker was launched back in 2008 with the main goal of letting general users help in improving the Google Maps experience. The service basically made it possible for the general public to contribute information about roads, rivers, highways and other geographic features, so they could then be added to Maps. While the feature proved to be helpful in developing Google Maps, Google had removed the service back in 2015 due to the abuse of some users. One incident involved the appearance of Bugdroid pissing on Apple’s logo on Google Maps. The offensive image made headlines, and Google addressed this by temporarily shutting down Map Maker then bringing it back with less functionality, according to Android Police.  Last November, Google gave a death sentence to Map Maker, saying that the service will be shut down and its features will be integrated into Google Maps. That time has come, so Map Maker is officially dead. To move on from this, Google is encouraging users to be part of the Local Guides program, which has the objective of helping other people find the best spots in town through the input of local users.  The program comes with exclusive benefits. One can earn points, unlock rewards for submitting edits and other information and even get early access to the new features of Google Maps.

After exploring the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 settings and looking for the best way to use the Galaxy Note 3  we discovered a collection of hidden Samsung Galaxy Note 3 features that unlock the full potential of this device. In addition to those hard to find items, we have a number of Galaxy Note 3 tips and tricks to help users get more out of this device. Wether this is your first Galaxy Note or you third, Samsung is well-known for hiding features deep within settings and including small extras into the more well-known features like multitasking and the S Pen. We’ll show you how to add additional storage to the Samsung Galaxy Note 3, on top of a Micro SD card, how to supercharge the keyboard, what you need to know for a better multitasking experience and much, much more. Most of these hidden Galaxy Note 3 features don’t require any extra accessories, so you’ll just need to tap through settings and learn the tips and tricks to using the Galaxy Note 3. These hidden Galaxy Note 3 features are not locked behind a special pass code and don’t require a user to root the Galaxy Note 3, they are just hard for the average user to find on their own. Check out these Galaxy Note 3 tips and tricks. It doesn’t matter if you are using the Galaxy Note 3 on AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, Sprint or U.S. Cellular, as these special Galaxy Note 3 features should work on every model. We could see some tweaks and changes come as Samsung offers up staggered Android updates in the future, but for now users should experience the same access. Here are 25 hard to find and hidden Galaxy Note 3 features that the Gotta Be Mobile team discovered while using the Note 3. Use the Galaxy Note 3 One Handed The Galaxy Note 3 is a large smartphone that is challenging to use with one hand, but there are settings to change which will help you use the large device one-handed. Specifically these  changes can make unlocking the Note 3, typing on the Note 3 and making calls. There is also an option to use one-handed mode for all screens with a swipe in from the side. this will shrink the display to about the size of the iPhone 5s’ display. To set up the Galaxy Note 3 for one-handed use, go to Settings -> Control Tab -> One-handed operation -> Check the options you want. The Use for all screens option is a bit much for everyday use, but there are times when you are in a hurry and can’t stop to use two hands to type out a message or check something. The most used one-handed operation tweak for Gotta Be Mobile team members is the Keyboard toggle, which pushes the keyboard to the right or left of the screen. Here’s a full how to on using the one handed keyboard on the Galaxy Note 3. To use the small screen mode on the Galaxy Note 3 swipe in and back out from the right side of the screen while in an app. This will shrink the screen so you can use it easier with one hand. This allows you to move and resize the window to fit your hand. Control S Voice Even when the Screen is Off Always on voice control is a major feature of new smartphones and Samsung includes it on the Samsung Galaxy note 3 if you know where to look. Once this mode is turned on, you can say “Hi Galaxy” to start S Voice, even if the phone is alseep. Previous versions would require the user to touch the phone to turn on the display before using S Voice. With the new S Voice for Galaxy note 3, users just need to say, “Hi Galaxy” and then tell the phone what to do. Options including making calls, performing local searches, looking up information, sending text messages and opening apps. Users can play music, but unlike the Always listening Google Now on some Android devices S Voice only controls the built-in Music player app, so no using Google Play All Access or Spotify. Tap on S Voice in apps -> Tap the Menu button -> Tap on Settings -> Scroll down and check Voice Wakeup to turn this feature on. Once this is on, simply say “Hi Galaxy” to use S Voice. Use the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 with Gloves The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 works with gloves on your hands, as long as you turn the setting on. This is perfect for contractors and outdoor sports enthusiasts who want to use the phone without taking gloves off. It’s also a handy feature for anyone who experiences a harsh winter. Go to Settings -> Control tab -> Scroll to the bottom -> Check Increase touch sensitivity. Once this is turned on you will be able to use the Galaxy Note 3 with gloves on. In our experience it works best with thinner gloves, as some heavy winter gloves will not work. See All Notification Toggles with a Two Finger Pull The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 puts settings toggles in the Notification drawer so users can quickly turn settings or and off and so they can quickly jump to a specific setting. Most users are probably opening the notifications and tapping in the upper right to see all the toggles or scrolling side to side, but there is an easier way. Pull down with two fingers on the notification drawer to show all of the settings toggles instead of your pending notifications. On this screen you can also hit the small pencil icon in the upper right to remove and rearrange the settings toggles to put the ones you use most at the top. Also to quickly go into one of the settings, you can tap and hold on the setting. This opens up that specific setting page, for faster access. Use Two Apps at the Same Time The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 comes with a Multi Window mode that many users call multitasking. This allows users to use two apps on-screen at the same time. In this new version of Multi-Window mode, the Note 3 can even put the same app on-screen twice to simplify talking in two Google Hangout windows. The video below describes how to setup and use Multi Window mode on the Galaxy Note 3. The video above explains how to use Multi-Window Mode on the Samsung Galaxy Note 3, how to use Pen Mode for a smaller window on top of other apps and how to use two of the same app in Multi Window Mode. You’ll need to turn some of these settings on by going to Settings -> Device -> Multi window -> On. The Pen Window mode and ability to use two of the same app at once are already on once this is checked. Make the Galaxy Note 3 Easier to Use with Basic Mode The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 can be daunting to the first time smartphone user, or even to an iPhone switcher. If you don’t want to see all the options and settings, and instead just want an easy to use phone with a big screen and a S Pen, turn on Easy Mode. The Galaxy Note 3 Basic Mode is an easier way to use the Note 3. Go to Settings -> Device tab -> Easy mode -> On. This will simplify using the Note 3 including the settings menu and access to commonly used apps. To turn it off, go to Easy Settings -> More Settings -> Easy Mode – Off. Customize Sound & Display The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 comes with the option to turn on adaptive sound and an adaptive display. These options will change the display and sound to meet your environment or your ears respectively. With Adapt display on, the Note 3 will automatically change the color range, saturation and sharpness for apps like Camera, Gallery, Google Play Books and several other apps to deliver a better overall look. Turn this on in Settings ->Device -> Display -> Screen Mode – Adapt Display. Alternately if you don’t like it, select one mode to use. Use Adapt Display and Adapt Sound to customize the display and sound profile for your Note 3. After setting that up, go to  Settings ->Device -> Sound -> Adapt Sound -> Start.  This will walk you through what sounds and feels like an ear test, that will help the Note 3 deliver the best sound for you during calls and while playing music. You will need headphones for this to work. Use Flash as Call Alert If you need to make sure that you know when someone is calling the Galaxy Note 3, you can use the camera flash as an alert. This is a popular accessibility feature on the iPhone, and now Samsung owners can use it as well. Use the Note 3 flash as an alert for calls. Go to Settings -> Device tab -> Accessibility -> Scroll down to Flash Notification and check the box to the right. This will deliver a very bright alert for notifications. Turning the device over will turn it off for that notification. Do Not Disturb for Galaxy Note 3 (Blocking Mode) The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 comes with Blocking Mode which is basically a Do Not Disturb mode for the device. Users can manually turn this on when heading into a meeting or trying to take an afternoon nap, or set a schedule to turn it on every night. Use Blocking mode as a do not disturb option on the Note 3. The easiest way to turn it on manually is to tap on it in the notification tray. Hold on it to open the settings where you can set an automatic start and stop time for Blocking mode. While in blocking mode you can allow calls from favorites as well as those who call repeatedly, so users can get through in an emergency. Control the Galaxy Note 3 with Your Voice In addition to using S Voice when the screen is off and the Note 3 is asleep there are a variety of other ways you can control the Galaxy Note 3 with your voice. Go to Settings -> Controls tab -> Voice Control. Turn this on and put checkmarks next to the parts you want to control by voice. Here’s a quick rundown of what you can control. Answer or Decline Calls Snooze or turn off an alarm Take a photo by saying Capture, Shoot, Smile or Cheese Pause, play and skip tracks in the Music app. This will not work when the phone is on vibrate only, for taking calls. When using Voice to answer a call the Note 3 will automatically go on speaker mode. Just be careful with the ability to snooze alarms without moving. Use the Galaxy Note 3 Hands Free in Your Car The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 comes with an easier to use hands free mode that makes it possible to use the Galaxy Note 3 easier while driving. With Hands Free Mode turned on the device reads out calls, messages, alarms and scheduled events and allows users to answer a call with Air Wave. Control the Galaxy Note 3 Hands Free. Turn this on by going to Settings -> Controls tab -> Hands-free mode and turning it on. You can pick and choose the options you want to be on inside this next menu. While active S Voice is more focused for a driver and can connect to a car from inside the S Voice settings. Never Lose Your S Pen The S Pen attaches inside the Note 3 so it’s not easy to lose, but spend any amount of time with the device and you’ll misplace it at least once on a desk or at a table. Samsung includes a small utility that warns you if you walk away without the S Pen in the included silo. S Pen Keeper sounds an alert when you walk away without the S Pen in the Note 3. Go to Settings -> Controls tab -> S Pen -> S Pen keeper -> check this box. When this is on the Note 3 will sound an alert and pop up a notification to check for the S Pen if you walk away with the screen off and the S Pen not attached. Quick Look at Notifications The Moto X comes with Active Display to let you see notifications without unlocking the device, and Samsung offers something similar with Quick Glance. You can’t see the notification text like on the Moto X, but you can at least quickly see the notifications you missed. Go to Settings -> Controls tab -> Air Gesture -> Quick glance -> On. Once this is on simply swipe your hand overtop the Note 3 when the screen is off to see notifications you missed. Check it out in action on the video above. Use Air View for Faster Access to Info The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 includes Air View which lets you use the S Pen or a finger to hover over details in select apps to see more without actually tapping on it or going further into a message or gallery. Go to Settings -> Controls tab -> Air View -> On. From here you can select certain actions that it will work with. It’s a good idea to choose Auto for the mode if you want to mix the S Pen and your finger, or you can pick which it will work with. When it is turned on you can see previews of messages, galleries and more without tapping. Smart Vibrations to Never Miss Alerts The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 lets users turn on a smart vibration feature that will make the phone vibrate quickly when you pick it up if you missed a notification while it was sitting on a table. This is especially handy for users who keep the Note 3 on silent or vibrate and set it on a table. The Galaxy Note 3 vibrates when you pick it up with Smart Vibration on. Go to Settings -> Control tab -> Motions -> Smart Alert -> On. Of course if you don’t like the short vibration when you pick up your Note 3, this is where you can turn it off. Smart Stay to Keep the Screen On If you are sick of the Note 3 display going blank when you are using it make sure to turn on Smart Stay, a feature that can detect your eyes using sensors on the front of the device. With this setting on the Note 3 will keep the display active. Use Smart Screen to keep the display on as you are looking at it. Go to Settings -> Controls tab -> Smart screen -> Smart Stay -> On. You can also turn on Smart Pause and Smart rotation, though they are not as useful since they only work in specific cases or in specific apps. Search All Settings As you may know by now the Galaxy Note 3 comes with a lot of settings and options. Even the settings have settings on the Note 3. This can make it hard to find a specific item, but Samsung includes a handy search feature that solves this issue. Galaxy Note 3 settings are tough to find, but you can specifically search settings and make changes in the results. On any of the Settings screens tap on the search field and enter the information you want to change a setting for to see the settings options and even toggle the setting right from the search results. Add or Remove Pages on Home Screen Samsung allows users to customize the Galaxy Note 3 home screen by adding and removing pages, but it’s not the most intuitive thing to find. To get started, go to a home screen and then tap on the Menu button. Customize the Galaxy Note 3 home screen with more pages. When the list of pages comes up, you can add or delete a page. This is also where you can re-arrange pages and set a new home page. This home page is where the home button takes you to when pressed. Search the Galaxy Note 3 If you want to find something you have stored on the Galaxy Note 3 you will want to keep these two tricks in mind. a long press on the menu button will open a search option that lets users search by typing or talking. The search app can filter by time, by type and can even search handwriting and personalized tags. Search your Note 3 for contacts, calendar entries, Evernote and more. Removing the S Pen and tapping on the small search icon in the pop up list of commands will also open the search. Searches look on your phone, including calendar, contacts and Evernote as well as offering the options to search the web. Quick Note on Lock Screen The S Pen is incredibly handy for taking notes, and sometimes you need to be able to write a fast command without unlocking the Galaxy Note 3. Go to Settings -> Device tab -> Lock screen -> scroll down and check the box next to Action Memo on lock screen. When the Note 3 is locked, remove the S Pen and double tap on the lock screen while holding the button in. This will launch an Action Memo window. With this window you can take a fast note that when saved are searchable in the S Finder. Fast Access to Google Now Samsung includes Google Now, the personal assistant from Google on the Note 3 but it is hidden in hopes you will use S Voice instead. While S Voice is a nice feature, Google Now is more flexible and a better option for many users. The Google Now button is tucked away inside of multitasking, but it’s still pretty quick to get to. Press and hold the home button. On this next screen tap on the small Google icon right above the home button. This will open Google Now. From here you can say, “Google” and then what you want to know. Master the Galaxy Note 3 Camera The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 camera is a very capable device that can record 4k video files for the ultimate HD experience as well as deliver great looking photos in a variety of modes. Burst Mode – Tap and hold the shutter button to quickly take 20 photos with one press. Best Photo & Best Face – Pick these options from the Mode button to take a series of photos that can pick the best overall or the best face for each user in a photo. Filters & Effects – Pull the small arrow on the left side of the screen in to apply filters and effects like fisheye without the need for any special accessories. Slow Motion and Fast Motion – Tap on the Gear icon on the right side and then on the camera icon to pick between slow motion or fast motion. Dual Shot – Tap on the small camera and back of camera icon to use both cameras at once. This will put your face in the photo for a family photo to put yourself in a vacation photo. Explore the other Camera modes for more hidden features like erasing unwanted people from a photo, adding motion to a photo and much more. Use a USB Drive with the Galaxy Note 3 The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 comes with a Micro SD card slot that is great for photos, but if you want to store a lot of movies or other files for access on the Note 3 a USB drive may be a better option. With an inexpensive Micro USB OTG cable you can make this happen. Buy a USB OTG cable on Amazon or your preferred retailer and plug it in like you would a Micro USB charging cable. Next plug a USB drive into the other end of the cable. This should open a file browser that ships with the Note 3. Tap on files or movies to play them right from the drive. Use a Handwriting Keyboard Anytime you have the S Pen Out The S Pen is a nice Galaxy Note 3 accessory that users can use to handwrite instead of tapping on the keyboard. Users who prefer to write their messages out can make the keyboard automatically switch to handwriting if the S Pen is out. To do this, open the keyboard by tapping in a text field. Tap on the setting icon to open up keyboard settings or tap and hold on the voice typing icon to open settings. In the settings app scroll down and tap on Pen detection to automatically use the pen for handwriting when the S Pen is out. Treat your eyes better with Reading Mode The Note 3 comes with a Reading Mode that tweaks the screen to deliver a better look for your eyes. This delivers a slightly different tone to the screen which makes it easier to read for long periods. Reading mode makes the screen easier on your eyes. Unlike most of the special apps that Samsung includes, users can add their favorite apps to the reading mode. Favorites include Google Play Books, Amazon Kindle App and Reddit is Fun. Give this a try to see if you like it for longer reading and browsing sessions. Pull down the notification panel with two fingers and long press on the Reading Mode icon. On this screen tap the pencil in the upper right to edit the apps it works on. Add Kindle or any other apps you want to use it with. To activate it tap on the icon. Then Reading Mode is on and you go into one of these apps the screen tone will automatically change and change back when you exit the app. 112 Responses 10/14/2013 richard Reply I love the note 3 , amazing in everyway!

However, I find it infuriating I can’t set the menu key to activate Google Now instead of S-Finer. Also, that magazine app they have is pretty annoying, too. Memo to phone makers: ALWAYS give me the option of disabling your features. 10/15/2013 Jessica Reply You can change the phone settings to not pull up the Magazine when you push the home button. Just go into the Magazine and hit the menu button on the bottom left side of your phone. Then click on settings. Then you can uncheck the “Open using the home key” box. That helped me. 10/17/2013 blaine Reply Thanks! The magazine popping up was quite annoying. 02/04/2014 Kat Reply Thank you so very much! That magazine opening with the home button was my absolute only pet peeve about my Galaxy note 3! I completely appreciate this entire article/tutorial. I love the new things I have learned. Sincerely, Kat 10/16/2013 Yoda Reply Download a free app from the market called home2 shortcut, you can configure the home button to bring up Google voice search 10/26/2013 Brian Cioffi Reply Also, you can set Google now on your lock screen, by going to lock screen settings. You can open it directly w/o even unlocking your phone. Or long press the home button and it is the center icon. Just my two cents. 10/14/2013 سهـــيل brite Reply Excellent tips, Shokran! Thanks! 10/14/2013 pintu Reply Awesome 10/14/2013 pintu Reply Nice post. Great features. Love this phone with s-pen. Good Job. 10/14/2013 Serena Reply Just got the Note 3 on Friday and I have not been able to set it down!! I keep finding crazy new things about it everytime and people think it’s a tablet when they see it – lol!! 10/14/2013 John Eztogive Reply I would go for quality instead of quantity. The S-voice sound stupid. The magazine slide-up is annoying. The sound quality is terrible. I have given up listening to my audio books on the built-in speaker: too many options to tweak the sound and none of then makes the cut. I can’t remap the buttons. I am forced to use these awkward buttons. I wish I can have a button to launch Google Now instead of having to hold the home button for a while and then tap the Google icon. Except for the stylus input, I have turn everything off. I have also uninstall the one they let me uninstall. Most Samsung and AT&T software can’t be removed even though they are completely useless. This phone not designed for speed and simplicity. I am sure this is a great phone for geeks who can root and tweak to their liking. I am seriously thinking about returning it but I like the big screen and the stylus. 10/14/2013 Manny Reply Whaaat? This phone can easily be customized for speed and simplicity (without rooting). Yes, it takes some time to go through the options and turn on and off for your personal needs. But, I’d rather have the option than not! S-voice: then don’t use it magazine: then don’t use it sound: yeah, not great, but that’s what headphones or bluetooth speakers are for buttons: there’s a menu, home, and back. why would you want to remap? that’d break a lot of app functionality. If you don’t like to hold the home button and then tap the Google icon to get to Google Now then JUST PUT A SHORTCUT ON YOUR SCREEN! Is it that hard? can’t remove bloat: do you run out of space? if not, then who cares? throw them into an “unused” folder and never have to look at them again. You don’t need to root. You don’t have to be a geek to tweak. Just spend 30 minutes going through the menus and picking what you want active. Then you can have a perfectly speedy and simple phone. That’s the beauty of Android… you get to customize it for your personal needs. If you want a big screen and no ability to customize then just wait for Apple’s eventual solution. 10/15/2013 Lord Shaz Reply Well said. 10/17/2013 PS Reply How to disable some App that I do not want to run, when the “Disable” buttom of these App are dim? 12/14/2013 Eazy Reply You my friend are insane, you would be returning the best phone in the market period! and for those non rooters, You are seriously missing out. You can root your phone and reset your phone back to stock and reset the counter to 0 so it does not look modded. For sound quality I recommend Viper4Android. Just my .02. Ive rooted and modded my phones for years and years and have never ever bricked a phone. If you can read and take your time and have a tiny amount of pc knowledge you will be fine. Not rocket science!!! 10/15/2013 Tim Reply Then return it…however, I’m not sure anything is going to make you happy. 10/20/2013 ron Reply Go back to your simple Iphone,,, they are made for those that want a “simple” phone, voice,text, and music 11/06/2013 JB Reply wow. Amazing how complete ignorance of a phone’s features cause ignorant people like this to blame the phone instead of the user. EVERYthing, save audio quality (use headphones genius, problem solved), is tweakable and adjustable. Though I have a hunch you would complain about nearly everything you have even though the technology we have today is a friggen miracle compared to 5 years ago. You sir, are annoying. 10/14/2013 mary Reply Love my note 3. Loved the 2, but this is sooo awesome. I knew most of the tops but did learn a few ones. When I get a new device (I go thru my carrier) I spend time in the store learning it. Sometimes I teach the employees, sometimes we learn together. I have not used the voice stuff much, but since I bought the Gear I needed to learn it. Spent time at Verizon today. What we haven’t figured out (question here) is: how do I change the DEFAULT calender notification from 15 minutes (how stupid is that default?!) to, say- 1 day? 10/14/2013 Kader Reply Thanks a lot for this amazing list 10/15/2013 Abdullah Yunos Reply Thanks for the tips. It really comes in handy 10/15/2013 bigkenny Reply Note 3 is the best phone out 10/15/2013 bigkenny Reply If you don’t know how to fully use the note 3 then go on YouTube they will show you everything they got a video for everything that deals with the settings and apps EVERYTHING 10/15/2013 richard Reply To john, if you don’t. Like the the note 3 then return the dam thing. That why they allow you to return the phone within a time frame, duh! Or maybe your a iPhone lover, that explains it! 10/15/2013 Ziobeieton Yeo Reply Great one. Thanks millions 10/15/2013 amzatha Reply Great list. But, cannot use SideSync with Note 3. Earlier i had S3 which worked like charm for SideSync, but having hard time with Note3. Dissappointed on this particular item and enjoying on all other aspects. 10/15/2013 Jarret Reply i will go for Note 3…Samsung smartphone is the best preferring 10/16/2013 Patrik Hodapp Reply How many home screens can you add, I dont get the option to add a new one… 10/16/2013 Nick Reply Any one know how to set up to where you can preview the incomming message? 10/16/2013 Anthony Schimmel Reply Open messaging, then hit the menu key next to the home button. Then tap settings at the top, tap more, then check the box for preview message. Hope that helps. 01/29/2014 carole Reply looked for the answer to this everywhere got it now thanks heaps 10/16/2013 pcjjk Reply Just like to stay that I’m really pleased with the Note 3 and prefer it to my old iPhone 5. Still using an iPad as I have a Fitbit tracker which presently doesn’t sync with the Note 3. Thanks for all the above information. 10/16/2013 John Blair Reply Uhh… where are the HIDDEN Features? While I will admit I am a phone freak, and love discovering stuff,, I am always disappointed when an article is titled like this and then goes on to point out STANDARD features. Yes, there are LOTS of them, but isn’t that Samsungs thing, and has been for the Note and S series from the get go. Next time, how about a descriptive title like “Galaxy Note 3 COOL features or something. Stuff that is a) in the manual and b) was all covered before the phone even got released is not what I would consider “Hidden” 10/17/2013 ironpeddler Reply anyone know how to activate a sent text tone? 10/17/2013 brian Reply Your Kidding right? 10/17/2013 ironpeddler Reply no I’m not. 10/17/2013 ironpeddler Reply Also, is there an easy way to transfer my music files and photos from my iphone to the Note 3? I used the bump app to transfer contacts and it worked great but it will not transfer the other files as they are too large. 11/06/2013 mary Reply Evernote or Dropbox? Music – can you export from computer to a micro card and then insert into the Note? 10/17/2013 Kirk Desilva Reply how are these features “hidden” anywhere? 10/17/2013 dineshchandgrinesh Reply Amazing post. The fastest smart phone in the planet 10/18/2013 Alex Reply Is there a way to use a third party keyboard for typing and switch automatically to the Samsung keyboard for s pen? I saw an app but it requires rooting. There must be something similar without root so I can use swyftkey to type but then write with the pen automatically when I pull it out. 10/26/2013 Brian Cioffi Reply excellent question!!!

Unfortunately, I don’t presently have an answer for you. 11/08/2013 Digityogi Reply I use the app: quick keyboard switch 10/20/2013 dana Reply hi…love this new phone…but one aggravating feature with the texting…it routinely defaults to 2 separate groupings for messages. Ie: during conversations, my old phone would place the next message on the screen according to time received…this phone places new messages at the top of the conversation for sender and receiver? I have to scroll to top of sender…it’s frustrating! any help would be appreciated. 10/31/2013 E Reply Hi, I’m E & I’m having the same problem, can you send it over please if you have it fixed? Greatly appreciated. Have a good day! eriveragonz@yahoo.com Thanks a lot. 10/20/2013 ron Reply Most of these features are already on the Note 2… 10/25/2013 PinkBananaHammock Reply True. But the Note 3 just looks sleeker. Plus, the screen resolution is more clear and you can see the screen even when there is sun glare. My Note 2, that I love dearly, fails me on that. 10/22/2013 SNote3 Reply Has anyone experienced the turning on of the Hands Free mode automatically…is this really a bug that Samsung will plan to fix with a firmware update or something? 10/28/2013 Alistair Dale Reply iSyncr 10/28/2013 steve Reply I am very satisfy with note 3. It is very usefull piece in my pocket. 10/31/2013 Adolfo Franco Reply Great post! However, I do have to point out it is an insanely expensive device.

I would like to hear a sound notifying me of a text message but not for incoming emails. Thank you for the help. I am new to the android world. 11/30/2013 John Blair Reply If you want different notification tones for email and texts, start by going to settings. On the Device tabbed section, select sound , then Default Notification Sound. That will be for texts. Now go into your email client. For the built-in email and gmail go to settings then your account. Sellect notifications and options like what sound, vibration etc. If you want different notification tones for Facebook messenger the settings are in the app as well. Just explore like crazy. You can do most anything, but need to spend time poking around. 11/29/2013 Donald Bender Reply I can’t find the “reading mode” icon on my note 3. When I contacted Samsung support they didn’t know anything about it and suggested that it might only be on some international models. Any ideas? 11/30/2013 John Blair Reply That’s ridiculous, not that you can’t find it, but that Samsung couldn’t help! Reading Mode is under Settings, Display, exactly where it should be. Once you set up what apps use it (Kindle, Nook etc.) you can toggle it on and off from the notification bar. If the toggle isn’t there pull down notifications with two fingers. That shows ALL toggle switches and lets you chage which ones appear normally. Finally, if you cant find some setting in the future (and that is not unusual with a Samsung Flagship, I find deeply buried settings sometimes months into ownership) just go to settings and type what you are looking for in the search box for settings. Yep. Samsung realized how ridiculous the sheer number of options were so they addeda special search box just for settings. It works really well, providing links that take you directly to the setting. Thers no longer much need to rely on tech support that knows less than the customer. 04/08/2014 Leif Reply I have Reading Mode, where you said it was Settings>Display>Reading Mode, but it is not on the pull down notifications on my Note3 (Verizon) 11/30/2013 Rob Reply I’m not a big fan of the calendar month mode. If I’m not mistaken you must touch the day of interest for the pop up to come on and then hit another day, or back key to get out of it. This may be a deal breaker. I love on the S3 and 4 how when in Month Mode you see the days events listed down below and can fly through look at each day without having to double tap. Uggh, got rid of Windows phone because of this same stupid layout, looks like Note 3 might go bye-bye as well. 11/30/2013 John Blair Reply Wow. People are really struggling with the Note 3. It’s not much different than other Samsung devices. In your case just select month. Then hit menu (bottom left), and select settings, View Styles. Then choose “Month View Styles”. I think what you want is called “calendar view +list) it gave me what you described. I am not trying to be rude, but it was reasonably easy to find this. 12/14/2013 Phl Offf Reply Where is the search for %^&*ing moron? 12/24/2013 Jon Reply I loved the note from the note 1 to the note 3.each one continues to get better.

HOME LOCAL POLITICS INTERVIEWS WORLD SPORTS COLUMNS EDITORIAL MY TAPROBANA RED CARPET CEYLON POLITICS TALKING CRICKET MINORITY PERSPECTIVES MY SERENDIB SCI / TECH ENTERTAINMENT GALLERY BIZARRE Features Mosaic Lite Hello PRINT EDITION News Columns Sport Focus Interviews FT Opinion E-PAPER CONTACT Google reveals latest UK tax bill   👤  2986 readers have read this article ! By 2017-04-03 BBC: Google was charged £36.4m in UK corporation tax last year, according to its latest accounts. The US search engine giant recorded sales of £1.03bn and a pre-tax profit of £149m in the UK for the 12 months to the end of June 2016. Like other major tech firms, Google has come under pressure over its tax arrangements. Labour said the firm was still not paying its 'fair share' of tax in the UK. Google's accounts also showed it hired an extra 600 workers to take its UK workforce to nearly 3,000 last year. Simon Gompertz, BBC personal finance correspondent Google is adamant that it is paying the 20% rate of corporation tax on its UK profits that businesses have to pay. But the debate over its tax affairs is likely to rumble on, because of the way in which it organizes its activities across international borders. Google declared turnover of just over £1bn in the UK in the year to last June. But the latest accounts filed in the US by Alphabet, Google's parent company, show UK sales of more than £6bn. One reason for the discrepancy is that it treats its business here as a development and marketing services operation. Sales are booked in the Irish Republic, where the tax rate happens to be lower. A Google spokesman said: "As an international business, we pay the majority of our taxes in our home country, as well as all the taxes due in the UK. "We have recently announced significant new investment in the UK, including new offices in Kings Cross for 7,000 staff." Google agreed to pay £130m in back taxes to the UK last year, which was widely criticised as not being enough. The sum covered money owed since 2005 and followed a six-year inquiry by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC). George Osborne, who was chancellor at the time, described the deal as a "victory", but Labour's John McDonnell said the sums were "trivial". The agreement came after years of criticism of Google and other multinational firms over their tax arrangements in the UK and across Europe. McDonnell said the latest figures showed Google was still not paying enough tax. He said: "It is a national disgrace that by paying just £36m in tax Google could have an effective tax rate lower than many working families in our country. "And it exposes the complacency at the heart of this Tory government, which is allowing this to still continue despite last year's scandal." He added: "It seems that the so-called 'successful' tax deal with Google that George Osborne boasted about last year has meant that they are still not paying their fair share under his successor Philip Hammond." 'Transparency needed' Meg Hillier MP, Chair of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), said: "Yet again we see a large corporation paying a rate of tax that belies its significant presence and business transactions in the UK. "This is why the PAC is working internationally to press for greater tax transparency so that we can all see clearly how much tax corporations pay and where. She added: "There is already strong international support and growing collaboration for changing the way tax is reported by multinationals. "This latest tax contribution from Google just underlines why this is so important." HMRC declined to comment on Google's tax payment, saying it did not discuss identifiable taxpayers. An HMRC spokesman said: "Everyone has to pay the tax due under the law and we do not settle for less. "Our most recent figures show that HMRC brought in a record £26bn in extra tax for our public services, with £7.3 billion of that total coming from the 2,100 largest and most complex businesses in the UK."

Robert Thomson is very cross about Google's monopoly. That is the same Robert Thomson who heads News Corp. Glenn Dyer Share Sometimes the inner monopolist works its way to the surface and you get an explosion of indignation that someone else has cottoned onto your lurk. And so we saw this morning with News Corp CEO Robert Thomson venting about Google and Facebook in a story in the Murdoch mouthpiece of choice (for their corporate explosions), The Australian. The story was headlined “News blasts Google, Facebook” and was placed under the fold on the lead business page, meaning that it had some prominence, but not much. We take from the placement that this is more of a whinge than a full-throated Murdoch moan. Sayeth The Australian (we do wonder if the phones dial out at Holt Street):  “The chief executive of News Corp has labelled Google and Facebook a ‘digital duopoly’, blasting the global tech giants for manipulating the flow of information to suit their financial ­advantage and creating a ‘dysfunctional and socially destructive’ environment for journalists and publishers. “Robert Thomson, in a scathing speech delivered at the Asia Society in Hong Kong on Wednesday night, accused Google of tailoring its confidential algorithm — which answers users’ search queries — to boost its bottom line and blurring the distinction between fake and quality news to the detriment of traditional media companies. “‘Both companies could have done far more to highlight that there is a hierarchy of content, but, instead, they have prospered mightily by peddling a flat earth philosophy that doesn’t wish to distinguish between the fake and the real because they make copious amounts of money from both — for them, free content has been free money,’ Mr Thomson said.” Thomson of course ignored News Corp’s position in the Australian newspaper market, where the company controls more than 70% of the daily sales, especially after being allowed to buy the daily regionals in Northern NSW and Queensland owned by APN News and Media, of which News owns 14.9% and is the largest shareholder. That gave News Corp a monopoly on newspapers in Queensland (especially south-east Queensland) — a point also ignored by Thomson. It also has a monopoly in South Australia (and especially Adelaide). Fairfax Media and Seven West Media the only significant competitors, sharing most of the remaining 30% or so, and are losing money on their publications on an after-tax profit basis. So also is News Corp, which wrote down the value of its Australian long-lived assets by US$310 million (around A$400 million) in February. Those write-downs tell us that not even monopolists are safe from the changes being wrought by the digital world — hence Robert Thomson’s spleen venting this week (and on previous occasions as he echoes His Master’s Voice, Rupert Murdoch). — Glenn Dyer Share this article Advertisement Topics Google News Corp robert thomson We recommend From around the web Powered by Taboola 5 comments Leave a comment Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

Reporter 100 Words Shareworthy Showcase Media Television Print Out of Home Digital Below The Line Radio Media Briefs Directories Case Studies Latest Advertising Marketing Media Digital Events Online Videos Where's the digital advertising money going, exactly? By Rahul Vengalil , What Clicks, Mumbai | In Digital | April 03, 2017 106SHARES Google and Facebook account for close to 50 percent of the total digital spend. Yet, the two platforms don't allow third party ad verification, laments the author. The last couple of weeks have seen Google coming under a lot of ire in the US and UK for showcasing ads next to objectionable content. Over 200 brands have decided to stop advertising from the network. The estimated loss of advertising for Google is approximately $750 million globally. That is a lot a money by any standard for the Indian advertising fraternity. This amount in question is close to 60 percent of the total digital advertising budget of India. This report got me thinking on why such a gaffe happened in the first place and whether there is an urgent need for brands and marketers to invest more into monitoring what's happening to their digital spends. For this, let us see how digital media has evolved over the time. 1. Fragmentation and Automation: There are millions of websites available for brands to advertise on. This includes content that ranges from games, lifestyle, news, music on one side as well as non-brand safe environments like porn, hate crime and even content relating to assembling a bomb. In such a scenario, when there are so many platforms to advertise on, and the only checks and balances in place are some algorithm that matches ads with words, it becomes highly improbable for brands and agencies to keep track of where the ads are shown. As Google's Schmidt said, "Every once in a while, somebody gets underneath the algorithm and they put in something that doesn't match." The only way to circumvent such a scenario is to increase the manual intervention on monitoring, which he himself acknowledges. 2. Click Frauds: A new report claims that $USD 16.6 billion is the size of click frauds. In all possibility, this number would also be underreported as another report claims that 1 in 3 clicks delivered across platforms are frauds. In the Indian context, where brands are investing more and more into performance marketing, whose only objective is to drive down the cost per click, the fraud economy is waiting to jump on this huge opportunity. In such a scenario, it is important that brands start investing more on understanding how much of the money was spent on humans and how much on bots. 3. Low Viewability: Viewability has always been a controversial topic. There are MRC guidelines in place for measuring viewability, which are at best flawed and at worst plain stupid. However, for conversation's sake let us consider that standard. In that also, India as a country has only 56 percent viewability. In other words, 44 percent of the ads served aren't seen at all or INR 44 for every INR 100 spent is wasted. This is a high rate of inefficiency in the system. 4. Newer technology: With newer advertising technology coming in every day, which invades privacy, listens to your phone, reads your messages, it is a nightmare for brands today to really understand where to draw the line. There was a controversy that Lenskart faced when they shot out an ad that said "Nepal Earthquake offer, flat 25% off" or something on those lines. How does a brand take cognizance of the sensitivity and sensibility of consumers, not cross the line, and not draw their ire on social media platforms? I have seen advertisements from one of the largest retail brands in India which have deployed retargeting with no Call To Action. The ad is displayed, they are charged for serving the ads, but consumers do not do anything, nada. The question then is, who takes ownership of monitoring these ads? 5. Duopoly of Facebook and Google: Google and Facebook account for close to 50 percent of the total spends on digital. However, these are the only two platforms in the entire digital industry, which don't allow third party ad verification. This means that brands and marketers are supposed to take their reports at face value. Over the last few months, there have been consistent issues that have come to the fore, which has led to a cry across board for them to open up their walled gardens. Just to refresh your memory, Facebook over reported their video metrics in 2016, put an end to beacon technology before that and now the famous fake news issue. Google came under the scanner for allegedly supporting favouritism in ad sense a few years back, then drew controversy over the shopping ads as well. In such a scenario, who takes the responsibility that the money will be spent wisely. The answer to my earlier question, on whether brands need to start investing into monitoring and testing is something that I would leave to them, I only wanted to bring to the fore the challenges that one faces in this space which calls for this mechanism. Let me leave by drawing parallel to the time when there used to be a media planning and buying agency for Outdoor and a third party monitoring and reporting agency due to the similar challenges that brands and marketers faced. The third party was in charge of answering the following questions. 1. Are the ads placed in the locations that the brand agreed to (fraud)? 2. Are the ads placed for the stipulated time frame that the brand agreed to (fraud)? 3. Are the creatives used the ones that the brand agreed to (creative)? 4. Are the ads visible enough for the consumers (viewability)? 5. Are the ads placed next to objectionable content/locations (brand safe)?

Google Map Maker is officially dead Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/02 8:46am PDTApr 2, 2017 25 Plus 1 on G+ 55 Share on Facebook 49 Share on Twitter Total Shares129 Google News Google Map Maker was introduced back in 2008, as a way for users to make contributions to Google Maps. Features like roads, highways, rivers, and so on could be added to Maps, and users could fill in details about businesses and other specific locations. After some vandalism occurred thanks to Google's poor moderation, the feature was removed entirely, and re-appeared later with less functionality. Google has been working to integrate Map Maker features into Google Maps itself, and announced in November that the independent Map Maker service would shut down. Now Map Maker is officially dead. Google's support page says that most of Map Maker's functionality is already in Maps, and the company will continue to add new features as time goes on.

(I'm aware GPS units are dead and the mobile phone is the way to go. I'm also aware that US carrier data in Europe is obscenely priced and that I already own a GPS with hundreds of custom POIs loaded onto it.) IVBela What if I want to mark duplicate places? Oh nevermind... Leonardo Baez this is buls*** There are many countries were the only source for trusted information is the comunity. With this change now we cannot change street names, street directions, allowed and prohibited turns, add returns or new road crosses. This is buls*** google. When in hell will you designate a team to do maps of bolivia, or agola or suriname? We the users are the contributors because no one else gives tools or trusted maps as google. And now all the maps will be frozen in time circa 2015 (because for many countries google stopped edits in 2015). I'm mad as hell TannoV If you'd actually read the article, you'd have read that the functionality has been integrated into Google maps. Tomáš Petrík And if you'd actually tried that, you'd have found out that you can only add/edit places like businesses and other POIs. However, it is not possible to rename a street, edit directions and/or turns, etc. modeless And if *you'd* actually tried that, you would have seen that as a Local Guide it is possible to rename a street, edit segment attributes and also report missing roads. roberto.elena Re editing directions and/or turns: There is a workaround for this. I've used it several times, because Map Maker was never available in Spain (one of the 20 or so countries out of 200 that wasn't lucky enough). What you do is set a route between 2 points that pass through that street or a make that turn you want to edit, and then use the feedback tool to report where the problem is. As I said, I've used it several times to correct illegal turns. Upvotes4Bird Thanks to Google's poor moderation? Thanks to shitty users. poop. It was both. Grey Map Maker had a piece of shit moderation community with bullshit, "what we want" rules. Trying to correct an issue is a nightmare. Trying to add something is a nightmare. No way to add building corrections after the vandalism. Trying to add a path that goes by a road is not allowed sometimes - despite tons of these paths existing. And they use Google Street View - despite Google Street View being quite a bit off the ground and giving a warped perspective. I love the idea behind Map Maker, I hate the moderation community and their stupid idea of rules. poop. It's still like this even with the "new" system jdrch Google killed another product users were relying on? No way! Stop the presses! Unheard of! Adrianus AJ Nadeak Map Maker was not working in one country used to live in. I did manage to name a street using Map Maker years ago but then it stopped working. With the country's frantic construction rate, many new roads have been built or redirected and as a result, Google Maps isn't as accurate as my current location. Many roundabouts have been converted to traffic signal intersections and a section of a new ring road is non existent. POI and places can be edited and added within the Maps app so that's not much of an issue.

Elijah Dunn I was paid 104000 bucks past year by doing an internet based task and I was able to do it by w­orking in my own time f­o­r quite a few hours on a regular basis. I used work opportunity I came across on the web and also I am excited that I was in the position to earn such great money. It's seriously newbie-friendly and therefore I'm so blessed that I discovered out regarding it. Check out exactly what I do... http://nubr.co/7HSc0l Armando Rodriguez Meh, I did the Chrome Home flag with bottom navigation. Way better than the old and new home ntp Corbin Davenport Yep, I can't wait until it reaches stable. Frederico Silva I'm curious, which flag is that? Eric Isntmyfirstname McIntyre #enable-chrome-home Nicolas Ramz It's nice but here the keyboard hides the address bar once it is opened, it doesn't "push" it up as expected. May be related to Android O developper preview dxdydz Nah it's been like that for a while on N (and maybe even M, I can't remember when I had it last). I tried out the bottom navigation for a while and it was super buggy. It'd be an excellent addition to Chrome on mobile if they could stabilize it though. FeelThePoveR It pushes it up for me on 7.1.1. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/eea28032a783d5db5417b6832e113b081c44a8886024b43e263876a8aacbd112.gif Borgman For some reason on Chrome Beta I enabled it and it wouldn't allow incognito tabs to open up. Did it do that for you? I loved having it below, but I couldn't open tabs in Incognito (this was like 3 weeks ago) Corbin Davenport I'm on Chrome Dev, but I can open incognito tabs. Borgman Maybe I'll try downloading Dev and see if the problem persists! Karthik B But I noticed that there is no 'swipe down the address bar and slide right' close gesture. This makes it hard to use JPLoureiro Does anyone know how to disable the recent downloads/bookmarks from the start page? I actually can't stand it anymore. abqnm Disable both #enable-ntp-asset-download-suggestions and #enable-ntp-bookmark-suggestions. Can't say how long they will last though. I'd get used to the changes, because the flags will probably go away sooner rather than later. JPLoureiro Thank you for the useful tip! You, Sir, deserve one bazillion internet coupons! I hope they at least provide us with an option (under privacy, for example​) to disable this in case the flags go away. Łukasz Ordon On mine that #ntp-google-g-in-omnibox flag enables only the G logo. Normally it's just white omnibox... Łukasz Ordon It looks like this https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3b7f3b9b99c11f4a8e8a194024aa9e3c7c3daaaf03f1e701f39fb9c9dd6c59c9.png abqnm You have to enable #ntp-condensed-layout and #ntp-condensed-tile-layout to get the new tab page like this on Beta 58. So I assume one or both may be required on 59 if it's not working by default. I've been using it this way for the past week on 58 and I like it. Less white space. Łukasz Ordon I am using Dev,,, look at the screenshot below - this look above is default (I may be wrong) for the latest version. That flag enables only the logo and not the whole look. abqnm It seemed like you were asking for the flags to enable the whole look. I get what you are saying now. But if anyone on Beta wants it, enable all three flags. Grey Can this do Speed Dial yet or is it just a stupid collection of recent websites I don't want vmxr so they are going to follow microsoft edge then Rafael at least they're using the dev version to test this and not using the stable version like Facebook does sometimes troyintn They should be more focused on speed and reliability... Doesn't matter to me anymore. I use Samsungs browser full time now as it is far superior in every way Maxr1998 I tipped about this a full month ago. Wondering why it's only posted now, not crediting me.. tim242 I hope you are joking... Maxr1998 Nope, I am not. I messaged Artem in Hangouts, and he told me "I don't think it's worth one [article] yet", and "until we can confirm it's not a mistake". So, of course I understand why they might have missed to credit me, as I a) didn't use mail and b) they're dealing with a load of news everyday, so it's easy to forget about it. The "Wondering" was meant rhetorical anyway. Yes, I'm a little butthurt about it, but don't judge me and don't take me to serious.. 😁 Richard Riker at least you can again trun off the annoying snippets. There is no seperate flag for, but just tturn them all off, then the snippet space only shows "that's all for now" Ruby well, the "G" has been around on phones forever now Darko Simjanovski They are ruining Chrome since version 31! Should I tell you that Google Chrome STILL DOESN'T HAVE CUSTOMIZABLE NEW TAB SPEED DIAL? Who needs the stupid "frequent" visited page, when you cannot set them up as you wish, and they keep changing all the time?

According to the New York Times, a ‘developers preview’ was released on March 21 for the benefit of app developers, so they could begin to work with the upcoming system. The official public release probably won’t happen until later this year, as Google endeavours to refine the system through rigorous testing to ensure it is in release shape. Expected features include an improved support for keyboard navigation of Android apps, as well as improved control of on screen notifications. On top of this, picture-in-picture video is getting some fine tuning so users can keep watching media such as YouTube videos while they shift around through other apps. Audio fidelity via Bluetooth connections will be strengthened, and there will be an improvement to Wi-Fi Aware technology. Wi-Fi Aware allows compatible devices to connect when there is no network data or wi-fi connection available. Google says there will be a “deep dive on all things Android” at the annual Google I/O conference coming up on May 17 of this year. These events are usually very developer-oriented and Google will use the opportunity to show off all upcoming new software. There is no official release date or official name, with both being announced later this year after further development efforts. Expect an announcement coming about which hardware models are eligible for the new Android operating system.

Google always does a great job, from the Pokemon Google Maps overlay to a smart mailbox, but there are a few from other companies worth mentioning. Here's a rundown of all the hillarious (or strange) tech-related April Fools Day jokes from around the web. Google Gnome One of Google's product launches from last year was the Google Home, a $129 smart speaker with Google Assistant. Now the company is teasing the "Google Gnome," an outside version of the Home. You can ask it weather questions, let it control your lawnmower and other tools, and even dress it up in accessories. The Google Gnome has a page on the Google Store, but unfortunately you can't buy it. I really want a rain coat for my Google Home, though. Mrs. Pac-Man in Google Maps For April Fools' 2015, Google added Pac-Man into Google Maps and Ingress. This year, Mrs Pac-Man is invading Google Maps. For regions of the world already on April 1st, a new Mrs. Pac-Man button is visible on the mobile app. You then have to control Mrs. Pac-Man on real-life streets, and of course, outrun the Ghosts. Google's Bubble Wrap Keyboard (English subtitles are available) Google Japan's prank is pretty funny - it's a bubble wrap keyboard. The idea is to pop bubbles on a bubble wrap sheet to form words, then feed the sheet through a reader to send the message. Some of the bubble wrap sheets are even scented. Google Assistant Google has plenty of Easter Eggs in Google Assistant, and as you might expect, there's one for April Fools' Day too. When asked, Assistant will offer advice on how not to get pranked, such as "If something seems too good to be true today, it probably is." Google Wind Google's Netherlands division has its own April Fools' Day gag, named 'Google Wind.' The idea is to use machine learning to control the weather, using Holland's famous windmills. I'll admit, this one is pretty great. Netflix Live Will Arnet has been in plenty of Netflix original content, from BoJack Horseman to A Series of Unfortunate Events. For April Fools' Day, Netflix is proud to share 'Netflix Live', which is nearly an hour of Arnett commentating ordinary events like toasting bread and completing a crossword puzzle. It's actually funnier than it sounds. You can watch the full thing here (a Netflix subscription is required). T-Mobile ONEsie T-Mobile's prank is a onesie, with "full-body coverage" and a built-in 4G LTE hotspot. You can actually buy it for $40, but the real one doesn't have any tech inside it. Hulu Hu With the claim that the human attention span has "dropped to eight seconds," Hulu has released 'Hu.' It's just a library of short clips from existing Hulu content, and you actually need an account to see them. This is probably the lamest April Fools' Day gag in the list - better luck next year, guys. OnePlus Dash drink OnePlus is really proud of its Dash Charge feature, even to the point of enlisting celebrities to talk about it. For April Fools', the company made real Dash Charge energy drinks. You can find our review of the drink here. Lyft Mono For April Fools' Day, Lyft has announced the 'Lyft Mono.' It's a wearable glove, vaguely resembling a Nintendo Power Glove. This gag is actually real, and once you put it on and get the app, sticking out your thumb will hail a Lyft cab. You can sign up to for a chance to get one here. Honor BFF We all need some positive reinforcement every now and then, right? Honor thinks so, and created the Honor BFF. This imaginary phone uses machine learning to periodically give you compliments and motivation. Hopefully it ships with Android 7.1 Nougat. Google Haptic Helpers This is probably my favorite gag so far. In order to create a more realistic virtual reality experience, you can schedule a "haptic helper" to come to your house and help create a more realistic environment. Just watch the video, it's hilarious. Amazon Petlexa Alexa is cool and all, but your furry friends need one too. As the name implies, Petlexa is Alexa for your pets. Contour by SlickWraps Putting a skin on your phone or tablet is too much work. For April Fool's Day, Slickwraps is teasing the 'Countour' - a machine that sprays on device skins. Frankly, I'm not sure if this is actually real or not, but there is a page for it on SlickWrap's store. Nvidia GTX G-Assist How many times have you been playing an online game, only to be interrupted by someone in real life? NVIDIA has made the 'G Assist,' a flash drive that can take over for you if you're busy. It can also help you beat boss battles, and provides periodic reminders to consume energy drinks. More information and a video can be found here. Google's data center on Mars If you have important data, you need a backup. That's why Google announced its first interplanetary data center, named "Ziggy Stardust," on the Google Cloud Platform Blog today. Located in the Gale Crater on Mars, it will store a cache of data from Earth to prevent irrecoverable loss when a planetary disaster strikes. Google hopes to finish the data center by 2018. LineageOS' mascot CyanogenMod's mascot, Cid, was one of the most recognizable icons in the Android community. As the spiritual successor to CyanogenMod, LineageOS has created its own mascot - 'Ink'. The project also announced 'Br0zip,' an artificial intelligence that can port LineageOS to any device in no time at all. Chromebook accessories Even though most Chromebooks can now run Android apps, you still can't use your Chromebook like an Android phone/tablet for all use cases. Until now, that is. Google has announced a Chromebook Groupie Stick (seen above), a Chromebook Cardboard headset, and a Chromebook armband. See the company's blog post for more info. Exynos Yoga Processor Remember when curved phones were a thing? Maybe we'll see more in the coming months, because Samsung has just unveiled the Exynos Yoga Processor - the first flexible mobile SoC. Anyone up for a Galaxy Flex? Carved screen protector Carved is a small Indiana-based phone case company, but now they are working on a wooden screen protector. Why hasn't this been done before? I'll take ten. I'm Feeling Woof/I'm Feeling Meow By force-touching the Google app icon in iOS, you can select "I'm Feeling Woof" or "I'm Feeling Meow." These give your pets access to the stuff they care about - from dog food to balls of yarn. More info can be found on Google's blog post. Waze maps for Mars According to the company's blog, Waze is has begun to map the surface of Mars. Certain members of the Waze community will also be sent to the Red Planet to more accurately map the surface. JerryRigEverything's NoPhone video If you haven't heard about it, the NoPhone is a solid piece of plastic designed to simulate the feeling of a phone in your pocket. I'm not really sure if anyone uses it, but JerryRigEverything is happy to break it just as much as any other phone. Google Translate for Heptapod B Using machine learning, Google Translate can now decrypt messages written in Heptapod B - the language from the film Arrival. On an unrelated note, it looks like someone from Google is still rocking a Nexus 10. See Google's blog post for more info. Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s ASUS has an April Fools gag too - the Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s Veritas Blue Limited Special Edition. I would probably buy this phone. MKBHD's Nokia 3310 review You may have heard about the updated Nokia 3310, but it turns out the original is an amazing smartphone. Okay, maybe not, but the video is pretty funny. Open GApps Femto Do you need to flash the latest Gapps package on your device, but you don't have a stable network connection? Not to worry, the Open GApps Femto package is here to help. It uses the United States HAARP service (which is not real, but just pretend) to download the latest GApps package. You can find more info at the GApps blog.   That concludes our coverage of April Fools' Day in the tech world. Let us know in the comments below which gag you liked the most!

The Galaxy S8 features a larger display than its predecessor, the Galaxy S7, and sports a voice assistant intended to rival Siri and Google Assistant. But there is no increase in battery capacity, providing the battery more breathing room. The Note 7 pushed the engineering envelope with its battery, which contributed to a series of spontaneous smart phone combustions. The Samsung Galaxy S8, right, and S8 Plus models have screens that curve around the edges and sport a voice assistant intended to rival Siri and Google Assistant. ASSOCIATED PRESS Enlarge The Galaxy S8 will come in two sizes, both bigger than last year’s models. Both models have screens that curve around the edges and get rid of the physical home button. The Note 7 recall cost Samsung at least $5.3 billion. Though many customers remain loyal, any further misstep could prove fatal for the brand. “We’re in the process of earning back that trust,” said Drew Blackard, a senior director of product marketing for Samsung. In the United States, Samsung started taking orders Thursday, with shipments scheduled for April 21. The standard-size S8 will cost about $750 and the larger S8 Plus about $850 — both about $100 more than comparable iPhones and rival Android phones. Samsung has blamed the Note 7 fires on multiple design and manufacturing defects in its batteries. Inspectors concluded that the initial batteries were too small for their capacity, and that their external pouch put pressure on the internal structure, leading to damage and overheating. Samsung recalled the phones and shipped replacements, but the newer batteries had welding defects and a lack of protective tape in some battery cells. Samsung recalled the replacements, too, and scrapped the phone. The company says phones will now go through multiple inspections, including X-rays and stress tests at extreme temperatures. The standard-size S8 phone has as much battery capacity as last year’s Galaxy S7, but the phone is 4 percent larger by volume. The larger S8 Plus model has 3 percent less capacity than the Galaxy S7 Edge and the same capacity as the Note 7, but the phone’s volume is larger by 12 percent and 6 percent, respectively. Both models have larger displays, meaning more drain on the battery. Samsung says software and processor efficiencies will let the new phones offer all-day battery life under normal use. The S8 phone’s display measures 5.8 inches diagonally, compared with 5.1 inches on the S7. The S8 Plus will be 6.2 inches, compared with S7 Edge’s 5.5 inches and the Note 7’s 5.7 inches. Both S8 models are taller than their predecessors, but widths are roughly the same to preserve one-handed use. Samsung claims its new voice assistant, Bixby, will do much more than rivals from Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. For one thing, Samsung says Bixby will be able to handle any smart phone task now managed by touch. Bixby also will offer information on books, wine and other products scanned with the phone’s camera. But there’s a major caveat: Bixby will work only with selected Samsung apps, including the photo gallery and messages. Not all touch commands will have voice counterparts right away. Other apps will be able to adopt Bixby, but Samsung has had a mixed track record in getting other companies to support its home-brewed functions. The front camera is getting a boost to 8 megapixels, from 5 megapixels, while the rear one stays at 12 megapixels. As with previous models, the S8 is water and dust resistant and features a memory card slot to supplement 64 gigabytes of built-in storage. The S8 will get an iris scanner to let people unlock the phone by looking at it; the feature was new in the ditched Note 7 phone. Samsung will include premium earbuds from AKG, a brand it acquired when it bought Harman International.

Name: Subject: Message: Some Pixel C and Nexus Player owners are getting the official Android 7.1.2 update Newsby John Callaham10 hours ago 3 272 12 If you own a Google Pixel C tablet, you may be lucky enough to be able to download and install the new, non-beta version of Android 7.1.2 Nougat. A number of owners have reported being able to snag the over-the-air update this weekend. See also: Best Android tablets 3 weeks ago Posts by Pixel C owners on Reddit show that a 340.1 MB update is available to download, at least for some users. In addition to Android 7.1.2, the owners state the download also has the latest April 2017 Android security patches. At first glance, this would appear to be released a couple of days ahead of schedule; most people predicted Google would make the non-beta version of Android 7.1.2 available for all of its eligible Pixel and Nexus devices on Monday, April 3. In the previous beta version of Android 7.1.2, the Pixel C added the Pixel Launcher for the first time, along with a redesign of the navigation buttons. Another big addition is the new multitasking user interface, which shows the last eight apps that were opened on the tablet in a 2 x 4 grid. As we have reported before, Google has no plans to update any Android tablets, including its own Pixel C, with Google Assistant. There are other, unconfirmed reports from Android Police that the Android 7.1.2 update is also available for the Google Nexus Player set-top box. Keep in mind that Google has not yet updated its OTA and factory image pages with this new non-beta release. Have you been able to download the Android 7.1.2 update on your Nexus or Pixel device?

It is open source, cross platform, and completely free desktop application for Google Keep. This means you can now take notes, reminders, etc on Google Keep right from your PC. This free Google Keep desktop client is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. So, it won’t matter on which operating system you are, you can use it to access your notes and add new ones. It renders the web version of Google Keep on its interface and there is no other extended functionality, just a few shortcuts by which you can quickly switch Google Keep screens from taking notes, reminders, view archived notes. This also means that you cannot really use it offline. If you have already opened this desktop client, and then you disconnect internet, then you can still keep using it. You can see old notes visible on its interface, as well as add new notes. However, you won’t be able to close this application. Once you connect to the internet, it will sync your changes to Google Keep. Sponsored Links Google Keep is one of my favorite notes taking app and I use it a lot on my Android. It makes it pretty easy to organize my thoughts and keep all related info on the same place. But on PC, I was left with the option to either use its Chrome extension or a Firefox addon, which required me to open browsers even if I didn’t want to. Another alternative was to use its Chrome app but sooner or later Google is going to shut them down. With this problem in mind, I set to find a desktop client to use Google Keep on my PC without having to use browsers and its short-life Chrome app. Luckily, I hit this GitHub project which eventually ended my search. If you still don’t know, now you can add notes to Google Keep from Google Docs as well. How to use this Google Keep desktop client for Windows: Getting started with this Keep desktop app is very easy; just download it from the link at the end of this review and then extract the file anywhere on the PC. After that, run its EXE file and you will see its main interface, which prompts you to login with your Google account. After you have successfully logged in, it will render the web interface of Google Keep, as shown in the main screenshot above. You can then use Google Keep in the same manner as you usually do in its web version. As I said, if you have opened this desktop client and then your internet disconnects, then you can still keep using it. You can take notes, reminders, etc and also view them in the offline mode. The newly added reminders and notes are automatically synced to your Google account when you connect to the internet. It also supports a bunch of hotkeys which allow you to quickly navigate to different screens of Google Keep, like Notes, Reminders, etc. Simply press “Control+1” to move to the Notes taking Google Keep screen, “Control+2” to Reminders, and so on. These hotkeys can be pressed anywhere on Keep, which will quickly take you to the associated screen with the hotkey. Verdict: keep is a free Windows desktop client for Google Keep which makes it pretty easy to take notes on Google Keep from PC. I will definitely recommend it to any Google Keep user who wants to jot down notes on Keep without using browsers. I really wish it was able to work truly offline, but I believe its inability to do that is because of some restrictions in Google Keep itself.

Google revealed it paid £36.4 million in UK corporation tax on pre-tax profits of £148.8 million in the year to June 30 2016 The firm came under fire from the Government last year for not paying its fair share to the exchequer and opposition politicians seized on the latest tax payment as a sign that the US tech giant was still not doing enough. Google insisted it paid "all the taxes due in the UK" but as an international firm it paid the majority of its taxes in its home country. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: "This revelation only further proves that Philip Hammond and Theresa May are more interested in cutting Google's taxes, than making sure they are paying their fair share. "It seems that the so called 'successful' tax deal with Google that George Osborne boasted about last year has meant that they are still not paying their fair share under his successor Philip Hammond. "We urgently need clarity on HM Revenue and Customs' relationship with Google and what reassurances have been provided to the company. "It is a national disgrace that by paying just £36 million in tax Google could have an effective tax rate lower than many working families in our country. And it exposes the complacency at the heart of this Tory Government, which is allowing this to still continue despite last year's scandal." Liberal Democrat treasury spokeswoman Baroness Kramer said: "It is appalling that Google are still getting away with paying such a paltry amount of their total revenue back in taxes. "Our worst fear is that the Tories would use Brexit to turn the UK into a tax haven sitting off the northern shores of Europe, there is no sign that this isn't where we are headed. "This Government is already struggling with the Brexit squeeze, if they want to stop cutting vital services they need to start picking up what is owed to the British people." Meg Hillier, chairwoman of the influential Commons Public Accounts Committee (PAC), said: " Yet again we see a large corporation paying a rate of tax that belies its significant presence and business transactions in the UK. "This is why the PAC is working internationally to press for greater tax transparency so that we can all see clearly how much tax corporations pay and where. "There is already strong international support and growing collaboration for changing the way tax is reported by multinationals. "This latest tax contribution from Google just underlines why this is so important." The firm revealed it paid £36.4 million in UK corporation tax on pre-tax profits of £148.8 million in the year to June 30 2016. A Google spokesman said: "As an international business, we pay the majority of our taxes in our home country, as well as all the taxes due in the UK. "We have recently announced significant new investment in the UK, including new offices in Kings Cross for 7,000 staff." The tech company paid £46.2 million in corporation tax for the previous 18 months to June 30 2015. That covered an extra six months of business before Google moved to a 12-month accounting period the following year. Google said both administrative costs and turnover for the period decreased as a result of the accounting changes. Revenue dropped £141 million in the year to June 30 2016 to £1 billion, from just under £1.2 billion for the previous 18 months. The company has faced mounting pressure over its tax affairs amid a backlash against corporate tax avoidance by multi-national companies. Google agreed to a controversial £130 million deal with HM Revenue & Customs in January last year to settle a 10-year tax inquiry into its UK business. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) declined to comment on Google's tax payment, saying it did not discuss identifiable taxpayers. A spokesman said: "Everyone has to pay the tax due under the law and we do not settle for less. "Our most recent figures show that HMRC brought in a record £26 billion in extra tax for our public services, with £7.3 billion of that total coming from the 2,100 largest and most complex businesses in the UK."

Love visual aspect of news?: Enjoy this exclusive slideshows treat! Google’s ultimate goal in India is a billion broadband users, each using 10 GB a month, says Gulzar Azad , country head, connectivity, at Google India . But, he says, to realise this goal, contributions will need to come from across the internet space, telcos, content players and the government. Edited excerpts of an interview with Danish Khan. What’s Google’s ultimate goal in India from a connectivity perspective? We would want a billion people online, and want them on broadband. And, that’s really where India’s full potential would be fulfilled. It’s clear that ‘digital’ is an economic growth force and that’s something India not only needs to move towards, but also track over a period of time in terms of achieving it in a given timescale. Google’s ultimate goal is a billion broadband users, each using 10 GB a month. And to do that, contributions have to come from the internet world, telcos, content players and the government. How soon can we reach 10GB per user per month in India? The data revolution has taken some time to emerge in India. But it can’t be more exciting, with consolidation happening, transformation happening and how data is being thought about at the operators’ end along with the government’s vision. We would like to achieve 10GB/user/month in the next 4-5 years. Google recently got its first ‘station deal’ in Pune. Are more in the offing? In the past one year, we started with railways Wi-Fi and completed 110 stations by end of the year. Usage levels and traction we are seeing from users, government and industry is exciting. Which is why we announced plans to create a product platform, Google Station, to enable reliable, fast and secure Wi-Fi by ISPs, venues and establishments. We are looking at more partnerships around the Google Station platform. A specific initiative is partnerships with system integrators. Larsen & Toubro is one we are in discussions with. Interactions are also on with ISPs. Some will translate into partnerships. What’s your take on the current state of Wi-Fi in India? Consumption and demand for public Wi-Fi is emerging, which establishes that it is complimentary to 4G and 3G networks. 4G and public Wi-Fi need to co-exist to fulfill India’s data vision. A foundation layer of public Wi-Fi is fibre layouts. The government is thinking about it both at the central and state levels. But more needs to be done. One stack is done and on top of it more and more pubic WI-Fi should come up. There are some headwinds on how the regulator is thinking about it. There’s a lot of opportunity and potential once the regulation comes in. What’s the update on Google-RailTel Wi-Fi? There are 115 stations live in India. The goal is to get to 400 stations with high speed networks jointly created by RailTel and Google. With 6 million users a month, there’s potential for much more. We are focused on ensuring that monetisation kicks in this year. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

Currently available to a handful of users of the Android users of the app, a future update could provide pop-up windows for video comments, reports Softpedia. Few users have reported that the new feature being tested by the video streaming site, will appear beneath the “Up next” section usually displaying related videos. Users, according to the report, could view and tap on the videos that they wanted to see after the current one ended. When you go to the Google Play Store, you will notice that the new feature has been included in the latest YouTube app update. It seems to appear as a server-side update—and probably explains why only a few users have been able to access it. Reading comments seems to be faster with the new experimental feature, and only displays comments to users who want to read them. It also comes with an icon for enabling comments as a counter on top, and states the actual number of comments posted for a specific video. Credit: http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/03/30/youtube-app-testing-another-revamp-makes-comments-less-prominent/ Global launch could be sooner than expected, especially since the feature is already being used by a few people and also appear as a server-side update on the Google Play Store. While it doesn’t feel like a major update or one to make users go crazy, I still think it’s not a bad addition. At least it eliminates the fact that one has to scroll down to see the number of people that have posted comments about a particular video. Last month, Google launched an easy to use app that enables you to connect with friends, but not before you have signed in with your Google account. Called Uptime, the new app enables you to connect with your friends and watch YouTube videos together in real-time. It features avatars that moves around the outside of the frame to show your progress. As soon as you log in with your Google account, you are greeted with a short introductory video that explains how Uptime works. If there are other people watching a particular video with you, you will see their icons moving along with you. This only reminds me of Facebook Live videos that lets you react to what you are seeing on the screen. From the look of things, Uptime is an app that offers a lot of potentials. Having an app that lets you share your favorite videos with friends is something that might excite a lot of users. Plans are already being made by the video streaming website to get rid of non-skippable video ads. YouTube will now focus on the six-second ads format, which could be regarded as more suitable to consumers. It’s shorter and consumers don’t have to wait for 30 seconds to watch a video on the video streaming site. It’s a different ball game if advertisers though; but if consumers don’t have too many grounds to complain, then it’s kudos to YouTube.

After quick updates like the LG G5 Android Nougat release, things have slowed down. Many are excitedly awaiting it to arrive, and here we’ll be going over everything owners need to know. From release schedules, confirmations and more. Including the LG G4 Nougat release. Way back in August last year Google rolled out Android 7.0 Nougat. Since then we’ve seen multiple quick maintenance updates, including 7.1.2 for the Pixel. Those with LG smartphone though, aren’t getting updates as quick. Read: Android 7.1 Nougat vs Android 6.0: What’s New Thanks to an LG Nougat preview program updates have been faster this time around. However, millions of those with an LG G4 or V10 are still waiting. Additionally, some LG G5 owners are still on Marshmallow, and are wondering when they’ll get the latest and greatest software. That and more is detailed below for all LG smartphone owners. Popular smartphones from all major manufacturers will see updates to Android 7.0 in the near future, if not already. Reports have surfaced from Samsung, LG, HTC, Sony and many others. Manufacturers are pushing out Android 7.0 though, and not the latest 7.1.1 release by Google. That will come later this year. Owners with the LG G4, LG G5, LG V10, budget devices and potentially even the older LG G3 will get Android 7.0 Nougat. Some already have. And while LG has been relatively quiet, we’re starting to see more movement. In fact, some benchmark results were spotted with the LG G3 running Nougat. A device that’s nearly two years old. That’s a good sign for owners, but don’t expect it anytime soon. If you have a G4 or V10 though, we have some relatively good news to share. The LG G4 Nougat Update is coming soon With that said, when will your LG device get Android Nougat? We’re not entirely sure, but we have some details worth sharing. Here’s the latest news on LG Android 7.0 Nougat updates, what’s new and more. LG Android 7.0 Nougat Updates The first smartphone to ship with Android 7.0 Nougat was the LG V20. As a result many expected LG to be one of the first for software updates too. On November 8th LG confirmed the LG G5 Android 7.0 update had begun. However, it didn’t arrive for those in the United States until far later, and most didn’t get it until February. A few are even waiting as we’re now in March. On November 8th the LG G5 Android 7.0 update began in Korea. LG confirmed it would soon arrive in the United States, Asia, then continue to other popular markets around the globe. The first update in the United States arrived on November 21st. Beginning with the Sprint LG G5. Several users on Reddit confirmed the news, then eventually Sprint made it official. The T-Mobile LG G5 Android 7.0 Nougat update quickly followed, and then the Verizon LG G5 update kicked off in December. Below is a screenshot confirming the software, November 1st security patch, and the large 1.3GB file. Here’s a screenshot for proof. The T-Mobile LG G5 Android 7.0 update is now available So what about AT&T? They’ve been fast with updates in the past, but that wasn’t the case this time around with the LG G5. AT&T is the last major carrier to send out G5 Nougat updates, which began February 20th. Multiple reports online have confirmed its arrival. Head into Settings > About Phone > and check for updates. Remember, AT&T only allows users to check once per day. Otherwise you’ll need to change the phone date forward and try again. It can take up to two weeks to hit your device, so by now most should have it. Next, LG will continue their efforts on the LG V10 and LG G4. When though, is a complete mystery. Originally we heard February and March, but that obviously didn’t happen. However, we do have new information. Reports from Korea say to expect the LG G4 Android 7.1 Nougat update in Q3, which seems way too late. Same goes for the LG V10, which could see it this summer. These are only rumors though, and we’re expecting LG to get these out within the next 1-2 months at the latest. When we know more we’ll share all the details.  The V20 needs a bug-fixing update too, as it has its fair share of problems with Nougat. Surprisingly, select LG G3 phones have been spotted with Nougat. And while it’s possible it may receive an update, the phone is nearly two years old. Meaning it may only get security and maintenance updates, not the new software. We’ll have to wait and see. What’s New in Android 7.0 Nougat At the top of the page LG owners can find an in-depth breakdown of Android 7.0 Nougat, how it compares to older software and everything that’s new. Of course LG has a lot of changes to the look and feel of our software, but it is a great place to start for owners. As a quick recap, the LG Android 7.0 update will bring improvements across the board. From performance, battery life enhancements, improved split-screen multitasking and other changes. Google has over 50+ changes in Android N. Like faster app installs, which are also smaller, a new JIT compiler, improved graphics and performance with the Vulkan API, and even streamlined notifications with new quick reply controls. Not to mention customizable quick setting tiles and other things. Expect all of that and much more from LG Nougat updates. A big addition to Android announced back at Google IO was “Instant Apps” which enables our devices to install small bits of an app (from a search result or web link) and allow one-time instant app usage. Giving smartphone users an app-like experience without downloading anything or leaving the web. Android just adds what it needs for that moment, and removes it once we’re done with the app. Here is more information on Instant Apps, which is now available for select Nougat devices. Most of this will come with LG’s software skin on top, and closely resemble the sleeker UI we’ve seen on the LG V20. Samsung has TouchWiz, HTC uses Sense UI, etc. Don’t expect everything from Nexus or Pixel devices, but most of Android 7.0 Nougat will soon enhance your LG device. Additionally, the Google Assistant is rolling out to any and all smartphones on Android 6.0 Marshmallow or 7.0 Nougat. It should be on most phones by now, or soon. Final Thoughts As of today the LG V20 and LG G5 are the only LG devices on Android Nougat. Others will follow in the near future. Now that the final US carrier is sending out Nougat to the LG G5, we should start to hear more about the V10 and G4 from 2016. We know they are next, it’s just a matter of when. Hopefully the Q3 launch rumor is wrong. It’s worth nothing that most of LG’s updates have arrived in February or March the year after Google releases an update. Like The LG G3 Android 5.0 update arrived March a few years back. Considering the G5 was in December the company is a few months ahead of schedule. If that’s anything to go by we could see LG G4 Nougat updates in April. Stay tuned for more details, and we’ll update the moment we know more. 8 Responses 11/09/2016 Danny Jacobovitz Reply I’d be happy if my 2 devices running Marshmallow would get update 6.0.1!

Policy Technology Are Minorities Being Left Behind in the Google+ Migration? By Jeneba Ghatt - 2:30pm July 18, 2011 15887 80 SHARE Facebook Twitter For all the talk about US Blacks and Hispanics being the most active users of Twitter and having a substantial membership on Facebook, it seems they may not be quickly migrating to and taking advantage of Google’s latest attempt at breaking into the social media sphere, the Google + project. It is still quite early in the Google+ roll out, but according to a recent analysis, membership on that site has grown 350% since it launched to members of the tech community on an invite-only basis on June 28.   Today, there are reports that over 10 million people have already joined Google +.   But scan the profile images of some of the 940,000 users  listed on the website Find People on Plus and you may notice the dearth of brown and black faces among users.  And even among those who managed to get an early invite, they are like many of the later adopters who do not necessarily “get” the new platform yet and have simply set up a basic profile and have not used it since.  Much of the buzz of the site had to do with the fact that so few people were allowed on in its earliest Beta testing stages. The curious all wanted a golden ticket. The site is used most actively now by the crowd of adventurous tech aficionados who are anxious to see Google finally get the social media thing right.  Google’s previous experiments with Buzz, Orkut, and Wave all failed to take off.   Google+ is slowly creating a new category of user addicts because it is cleaner, so far Ad-Free, and is touted as not being riddled with the same privacy concerns as Facebook, neither is it saddled with applications that litter users streams with gaming updates, for example.    Many Google+ users spend their time sharing ideas and tips on how to navigate the site.  They also lament how much better it is than Facebook in that it allows them more control over with whom they share information and interact, and how much easier it is to filter out those who they want to limit access to certain updates or photos. Who is on Google+ now? It still may be too soon to be taking a critical look at users of a 3-week old site, but since it launched, several articles have examined every aspect of the site including the fact that at one point, only 10% of its users were female.  Because more and more studies reveal that Hispanics and Blacks have higher than average mobile phone ownership and are accessing broadband through their mobile devices, it is not too presumptuous to think those groups would have been early adopters of Google+.  The “digital elite” , the interconnected web of popular bloggers, technical experts and early adopters to the newest technologies,  made up the earliest invitees.  This elite group is quite monolithic and for the most part includes middle to upper middle class professional whites and Asians.   In America anyway, most socialize in racially segregated circles so when Google allowed those on the site to invite their friends, it should come as no surprise then why the second wave of users mirrored the racial make up of the first wave.  Members of the black Technoratti who work with and associate with the general population of tech experts have a  healthy representation on Google+ now as well.  Perhaps, as they began to invite their circle of friends, they helped diversify the site. But beyond these audacious early users,  many are still skeptical about adopting yet another social media platform, and especially one that is not necessarily intuitive.   Google + requires people to categorize their network of family, friends, and colleagues into neat circles and enables users to participate in simultaneous video chat and explore articles categorized by interest. Google+ is not that intuitive as the tech savvy application development community may think.  It certainly is  not as turnkey as Facebook.  With Facebook, anyone can  pretty easily figure out the lay of the land within moments of signing up.  Not so much with Google +.   In response to some user confusion, there have been over two dozen articles published by leading tech publications and sites explaining how to navigate the site.  A killer competitor to Facebook  shouldn’t be so difficult to circumnavigate. And even then, many have already invested lots of  time cultivating a home on Facebook, building photo albums and “friending” long lost classmates and relatives.  It will take a lot to get many reluctant and less active  folks to adopt Google +.  So the question remains whether it will survive the initial rounds of early users, folks who are eager for its success and will more quickly appreciate its benefits. But then again, not all people “got” Twitter initially either.  Minorities slowly gravitated to it as well and have since taken over,  some reports say.   An Edison Research annual report on Twitter  showed that Blacks represented 25% of Twitter users, roughly twice their share of the population in general.  A Pew Research Center’s Internet & American Life Project report showed slightly lower usage statistics, but still impressive, indicating usage among blacks and Hispanics proportionate to their population at 13% and 18%, respectively. Google+  shares user demographics based on region of the country, profession, and gender but not race.   When Google opens the site to all users, we may likely see more minorities migrate over but not as quickly as one would think or some would want. Social media expert Lindsay Holmes, owner of LCH Business, a branding & marketing company, says while Google+ may be a competitor to Facebook, she doesn’t think Google+ will be Twitter killer. “People who get Twitter and use it for marketing won’t abandon it that fast because they know its utility and Google+ can’t compete,” Holmes said. ” If there is anything that will slow minorities down from adopting any new technology that would be  intimidation and once they get over that initial hurdle, they will get on.” Holmes said when people are able to realize the usability of Google+, they will join more when it becomes available to more.  “We are people that need usability and understand usability,” she added. It is quite possible then that Hispanics and Blacks, as a group, may be among the last to join the site if it indeed lasts through the long haul and becomes a viable competitor to Facebook.  They may be less likely than other groups to join the bandwagon and try a new platform.  They may remain loyal users of Twitter and Facebook as Asian and Whites, and tech savvy higher income minorities join Google+. Google+, the place to go to escape the  “ghettoization” of other social media platforms In essence, if  Google+ indeed is able to court away some of Facebook’s 750 Million users and black and brown users adopt later, we may be looking at a repeat of what happened with MySpace.  According Researcher Danah Boyd, scores of more affluent and white users abandoned MySpace for Facebook partly because there was an impression that it had become too “ghetto” and used by blacks and Hispanics.     She discussed this issue back in 2007 in a controversial chapter of a forthcoming book addressing “digital” white flight, the Digital Race Anthology. In White Flight in Networked Publics?  How Race and Class Shaped American Teen Engagement with MySpace and  Facebook, the Microsoft Research and Harvard Berkman Center for Internet and Society scholar conducted ethnographic research and used anecdotal conversations with over 100 youth to conclude there was a “white flight” from MySpace because it had become too brown. Currently, Blacks and Hispanics still have a predominant presence on MySpace and are represented on that site at a disproportionate rate at 26% and 45%, respectively, when they are 12% and 16% in the population as a whole.  Some have speculated, though not gone on record saying, that Rupert Murdoch sold off MySpace, which was once valued at $12 billion for a mere $35 million because he saw no value in a tool being used primarily by minorities and poor whites.  Some critics of Murdoch say MySpace went down hill after Murdoch’s Newscorp acquired the once popular site, first used by nascent bands and performing groups to promote their albums and songs.  He failed to sufficiently invest in it to make it competitive to new sites – Facebook launched one year after MySpace- and then quickly abandoned it when its cream users stopped using it.  A more plausible explanation may be that NewsCorp simply wanted to free up some cash to acquire a majority stake in UK’s Sky Broadcasting, that MySpace was too prone to viruses, hackers and spam than Facebook or because Facebook was simply more attractive options for users.  But those who stayed, did so by choice.  As one blogger on the Project Economic Refugee pointed out, what Latinos loved about MySpace was the freedom to be creative, everything Facebook isn’t and why they did not join it when everyone else was. Facebook  is used widely by all races these days as is Twitter. But as mentioned,  recent reports indicate higher than average Twitter use among Blacks and Hispanics and data indicate this may because they are more likely using their mobile devices to access social media than whites. According to a new report by the Pew Research Center’s Internet & American LIfe Project, 44% of African Americans and Hispanics say they own a smartphone, compared to just 30% of non-Hispanic whites. Using this type of data as a guide, several bloggers and tech watchers have pondered whether Black and Hispanics use of mobile devices will enable them to leapfrog over other groups and help them bridge the digital divide. While idealistic and hopeful, that outcome would hardly be realized so long as Blacks and Hispanics are slow to navigate to new services. Are minorities positioned to be left behind? Since Google+ was rolled out, a benefit of being an early adopter is being able to access and be visible to some of the top players in the digital, programming and application world.  Those who are followed by millions on Twitter, are only being “followed” by hundreds or thousands on Google+.  When followers pose a query as a follow up to a post by a more popular user, they are more likely to get a direct answer.  There is interaction. Right now is the peak and prime time to get on, start exploring, learn from and exchange with leaders in your field you may not ordinarily have easy access to on other platforms.  Once the site is opened to millions that accessibility will dissipate most likely. Many of the current inhabitants are dreading the inevitable.  When news broke this week that Google plans to soon open up the social media tool to everyone, some Google+ users let out a collective sigh. “There goes the neighborhood,” one person commented on the stream of noted Tech writer Mike Elgan. Another added, “As soon as Google+ is open, the quality will drop.” These retorts show that Google+ perhaps , for a few, is a place to escape the not so pleasant aspects of Twitter, including users who in the past have been said to be degrading the medium by using it to create and discuss crass, misogynistic, racist and even violent trending topics.  While some users may want to be exclusionary, Google can’t afford to shun anyone if it truly plans to put a dent into Facebook’s 750 Million user database. It will have to be inclusive of broad demographics, encourage them to navigate over and make it useful and easy for them to stay and set up shop in a similar fashion as the earliest adopters. When the site is eventually opened who is to say even whether minority groups and younger users will wander over and join immediately?  It may not matter. Google+ may bolt out the starting gate, gain momentum and slowly die out just like other social media sites that have tried to rival and best Facebook.   Only time will tell.

That move, prompted by reporting in The Times of London, began a broader advertiser exodus that has now extended to the US, amid concern that the technology giant is not doing enough to prevent brands from showing up next to offensive content. The issue has been particularly poignant for publishers, who have been adversely affected by the way most online ads work. Automated technology allows companies to advertise on numerous websites in an attempt to cheaply and efficiently reach specific people based on their browsing habits. There was irony in The Guardian’s having to pull the ads, given that attracting more paid subscribers is a way for it to mitigate the fact that many companies do not need to pay to directly advertise on its news site, Hamish Nicklin, the chief revenue officer of Guardian News & Media, said. “We were trying to bridge the gaps in our ad decline, and the decline was caused by YouTube and Google’s dominance in the space — only to have to slow down our potential acquisitions because of the very same tools and products,” Nicklin said. As of March 24, the publisher had yet to resume marketing with Google, which takes a percentage from the ads placed on YouTube and the over two million sites in its display network, though it was “very likely” to reinstate search ads soon, he said. Major advertisers including AT&T, Coca-Cola and Wal-Mart yanked marketing dollars from Google recently after reports showed their ads on YouTube videos promoting hate speech, terrorism and racism. While Google apologised and outlined steps it would take to guard against those situations, it has also defended itself by pointing to the volume of content it oversees. That has not appeased advertisers, who wonder if they are indirectly supporting hate speech, particularly as social media-savvy watchdogs prove able to turn one inappropriate appearance into viral, brand-damaging moments in and of themselves. “We needed to react very, very quickly,” Nicklin said. “We knew the next day that our brand, which is fundamentally important to us, was about to be splashed over the Times front page for all the wrong reasons.” Ad agencies have seized on this moment to emphasise their value as middlemen between brands and the likes of Google and Facebook, which have become two of the world’s most valuable companies through online ad sales, and to attempt to pressure the Internet companies into providing them with more access to closely guarded data and metrics. He added, “I certainly don’t think YouTube is the only one here that’s got challenges. I think it’s relevant to every single ad tech company that buys inventory at scale that’s very, very targeted at low costs.” Nicklin said there was a fine balance between relying on Google as a partner and “using them as an advertising tool in our own right.” “We’re all reliant on Google in this ecosystem,” he said.

Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) Apr 2, 2017 at 1:25PM Himax Technologies (NASDAQ:HIMX) has been publicly traded since 2006, and since then the fabless semiconductor company has experienced a few massive stock price run-ups and a few substantial drops as well. Investors who bought Himax right when the company went public have seen their investment gain just over 4%. To find out how the company might perform in the near future let's take a quick look at what's caused Himax's stock to pop -- and dip -- and if the company is likely to experience more of the same going forward.  Image source: Getty Images. Himax's share price history As you can see from the chart below, Himax's share price history has been on a wild ride since mid-2013, after experiencing a slow decline following its IPO.  Himax's stock price began skyrocketing in 2013 on news that Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google was implementing some of Himax's technology into its ill-fated Google Glass device. Google even took a 6.3% stake in the company at the time, with the option of grabbing 14.8% of Himax if wanted it -- which Google eventually decided against .  Image source: YCharts. During that time the company's stock hit an all-time high, only to plummet after things with Google and its Glass device didn't pan out.  Then, near the beginning of 2016, investors started getting excited about Himax's prospects in the AR space again, this time on hopes that Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Hololens would bring Himax's share price huge gains. Unfortunately, the company faced a similar situation as in the past when the Hololens failed to bring huge gains for Himax. Investors began dumping the stock after a few analysts cut their buy ratings on news that Hololens shipments were lower than expected. Looking ahead Much of Himax's prospects are being built around the company's ability to supply technology for its AR customers. On Himax's recent earning call, CEO Jordan Wu said that,  Having invested in related technologies for over 15 years, we are uniquely positioned as the provider of choice for micro display and related optics, both of which [are] critical enablers to AR devices. The company is ramping up for more sales of its liquid crystals on silicon (LCOS) and wafer-level optics (WLO) products for AR devices after ramping up production for both later this year and into 2018.  Himax says that the ramp-up is because its AR customers are looking to their next generation devices, and that Himax's tech will benefit from that. While this certainly could be true, it also feels a little like 2013 all over again. Betting on AR -- which is still an unproven market -- could take a long time to pay off for the company. Northland Capital Markets' Tom Sepenzis wrote in a recent investor note (republished on Barron's): Augmented reality remains the largest potential for HIMX with its LCOS and WLO products, but the market has hit another stumbling block as prices remain prohibitive for consumers. We believe that this will limit the number of new AR devices for the next 12-24 months.... AR is expected to be worth $117 billion by 2022, according to Markets and Markets research. Investors can look to Himax's past share price volatility and see that betting on this stock's AR future can turn out badly. A better approach may be to wait a little while longer and see if Himax's technology investments bare some fruit later this year and next, and then see how well that positions the company in the AR space. Right now, investing in Himax looks like a bet on both its unproven prospects in AR and that the augmented reality market will grow quickly. Himax's history has shown that investors can easily get caught up in the stock's future potential, while disregarding the hurdles the company faces.

Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) Apr 2, 2017 at 2:09PM Machine learning is part of the broader artificial intelligence (AI) market, where computers are given information and learn how interpret it on their own. Self-driving cars, for example, may be preprogrammed not to cross over a double yellow line when they drive, but machine learning within those driverless cars will learn that in certain situations -- like getting around a parked car on the street -- it may be necessary to cross over that line.  Machine learning's market potential is often lumped together with the AI market, which is expected to be worth $47 billion in 2020, according to industry analytics company IDC. And three companies -- NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) -- are betting big on the market in 2017. Image source: Getty Images. NVIDIA NVIDIA's known for its graphic processing units (GPUs) for the gaming sector, but the company is increasingly using its chips to power machine learning systems in powerful servers.  NVIDIA says on its website that GPUs can process more information in less time, and use less data center infrastructure to do so, which makes them the ideal candidate for machine learning systems.  And a lot of companies are already using NVIDIA's GPUs for their machine learning. Facebook uses the company's GPU accelerators for its Big Sur machine learning computers and says on its website that, "Leveraging NVIDIA's Tesla Accelerated Computing Platform, Big Sur is twice as fast as our previous generation, which means we can train twice as fast and explore networks twice as large." And Alphabet's Google is tapping into NVIDIA's GPUs for its cloud platform. The company recently wrote on its blog that NVIDIA's Tesla K80 GPUs are now available on Google's Compute Engine and Cloud Machine Learning to allow developers to rent the machine learning resources that they need. Grabbing big clients like Facebook and Google is important, of course, but NVIDIA also has its own machine learning and AI prospects as well. The company sells its $129,000 DGX-1 server for AI processing and its Drive PX 2 computer for self-driving cars.  NVIDIA's own offerings, along with sales to other companies, are already starting to pay off. The company's data center revenue grew by 205% year over year in the most recent quarter. That didn't all come from machine learning, but it shows that NVIDIA is already on the right track with its GPU-powered data centers, and machine learning could accelerate that opportunity even more.  Intel Intel has long been the clear leader in the server space, with 99% of market share, and the company is trying to parlay that position into a strong machine learning offering as well.  One way it's doing this is with the recent acquisition of driverless-car tech company Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY). According to a recent MIT Technology Review article, "Intel's acquisition of Mobileye shows how critical data and machine learning are to the auto industry's future." With this acquisition, Intel is paying $15.3 billion to help keep up with NVIDIA, which has been pulling ahead in machine learning. Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis said in an investor note several months ago that Intel has been "playing catch-up to NVIDIA" in the AI space, but that it's making progress toward better long-term prospects. Mobileye should certainly be considered one of those long-term prospects, as the company's technology is already used in 70% of advanced driver assistance systems and will give Intel an opportunity to show whether its processors can compete against NVIDIA's GPUs in the self-driving car market. IBM Last but not least, IBM is making a huge play in machine learning with its Watson machine learning analytics. IBM recently announced that it's bringing Watson to its mainframe customers, allowing them to intelligently search through their own data.  The company says that most data lives in what's called the private cloud (mainframe servers owned by large companies) and that its machine learning systems will help companies sort through their own data and make better decisions with it.    For example, IBM says that its new cognitive platform can help retail companies forecast sales market trends on a daily basis, as opposed to the usually monthly analysis. Or offer financial advisors a better way to recommend products based on a client's interests, trends, and market movements. IBM also says that its machine learning platform can analyze the best way for healthcare companies to offer individual products on a more personalized basis. IBM believes the cognitive computing market, which encompasses machine learning, will become a $2 trillion market by 2025. To help capture more of that market, IBM has made a series of acquisitions in the cognitive healthcare space recently -- to the tune of $4 billion -- in order to solidify its position. Top stocks, but still some unknowns While the machine learning space is growing, there are still a lot of uncertainties as to who will benefit the most in this space. But if I had to pick one stock right now, I'd lean toward NVIDIA. IDC has said that GPUs can "improve the performance of analytics computing", which encompasses machine learning systems. The company has huge upside potential in the space, considering that NVIDIA is the leader in the GPU processor space right now. Additionally, if machine learning takes longer to grow than expected, NVIDIA has its strong gaming revenue and a growing data center business to fall back on.  Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Google is retiring Google Talk for good, also shutting down several Gmail Labs Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/03/24 10:46am PDTMar 24, 2017 71 Plus 1 on G+ 159 Share on Facebook 105 Share on Twitter Total Shares335 Applications Google News Before there was Allo and Duo, before Hangouts was unveiled, there was Google Talk. In some ways, it was better than the Hangouts platform that replaced it. Talk had a real desktop app, and if you didn't like it, you could use any XMPP client to communicate. You could even send messages to users on other XMPP-powered services - a huge difference from today's proprietary messaging services. Google Talk was ultimately updated to Hangouts in 2013, but some of Google Talk's services still remained active. Today, Google announced in a blog post that the remains of Talk are being completely shut down. The Android app will stop functioning as of today, and for people still using the Talk widget in Hangouts, it will switch over to Hangouts on June 26. Google Talk's old XMPP support still remains in use today, because it's the only way to send and receive Hangouts messages outside of the official mobile apps and Chrome extension. Google says Hangouts will continue to support 1-on-1 chats with XMPP, but XMPP federation with other services will "no longer be supported" starting June 26. Beyond Google Talk, the company is also retiring a few Gmail Labs, citing Gmail Add-ons as an alternative for G Suite users. The labs being shut down include Authentication Icon, Google Voice Player, Picasa previews, Pictures in chat, Quick Links, Quote Selected Text, Smartlabels, and Yelp previews. Finally, Google is removing two legacy G+ features in Gmail - the ability to email Google+ profiles, and the use of Google+ circles. See the source link below for more details.

Chris crap, now I'm going to have to dig up my icq number. basteagow I don't know how, but I still remember mine. Artem Russakovskii Same. It's ingrained in my memory because I had one before I even had a social security number. Sir_Brizz I've had mine since high school. Still remember it. Impulse_Vigil Same, tho I never memorized it... ICQ and IRC were like my primary means of communication all thru high school, didn't even have a phone until like senior year. Wayne Moyer I still remember my six digit one. privatedick I still remember my 8-digit ICQ number and I have no clue why. Wayne Moyer Because numbers are sometimes easy to remember.

Browningate ...and announces one hour later that Google Friends will be shut down within the next twenty minutes and all user data will be lost. 4Ui812 🤣🤣🤣🤣 DirkBelig Well, this explains why today felt no different from any other day. John So Hangouts will also remain a consumer service. Along with Allo, Duo, Messages, and Voice. They have a plan, right? They must, right? Corbin Davenport Hangouts isn't going away for consumers, but they really want consumers to switch to Allo/Duo. xeratun Hangouts isn't going away for consumers*, but they really want consumers to switch to Allo/Duo. *yet They aren't gonna pull out the rug, but do seem to be slowly removing uses for it. Once Talk and SMS are gone, then Fi/Voice is the last thing forcing it to stay a consumer service. And the Voice app started getting updates, so I wouldn't be surprised to see Fi integrate with that. If that happens then I would be surprised if they don't start pushing people to switch. EcE Probably "for now" is missing from that statement. If they port everything (chat history, contacts, etc) from Hangouts to Allo and make a desktop/web client, I'm "ok" with this. But I know it won't happen. Total Insecurity It will happen. Some day. M. Luciano Most of that's coming, chat history that follows multiple devices and survives resets is difficult but obviously possible. Difficult to do without making the Google sign in required, but it is doable. EcE I tried using Allo, not one single person I know was interested in trying it. I mostly use hangouts for my communications, I don't see how will those people move from Hangouts if Google doesn't "force" them to switch before eventually killing the service... which I can definitely see happening. trwnh If Hangouts dies, my de facto primary communication channel will be Twitter DMs. A real shame more people don't use Wire or Sid or even Signal. I hope RCS makes federated universal messaging a reality. :/ Sir_Brizz RCS is more than likely "hopelessly misguided" since the carriers won't just support it but control it. Sir_Brizz How is this "difficult" when Google have been doing it for years with Google Talk and Hangouts? M. Luciano Those required a Google account and acceptance of privacy policy, etc. Allo had the later, but not everyone wants all their stuff on Google's servers. Sir_Brizz I'm not saying it necessarily needs to be on by default. I brought this up on G+ with Ian Lake as well that it makes no sense that the already existent optional connection to your Google Account can't also enable a bunch of additional features like account access (anyone with your email can invite you to chat with them), history, etc. that are all options you can enable or disable. It makes no sense at all that Hangouts was developed as Gmail account based and was awful at phone number based features and Allo is exactly opposite. Why can't Allo be decent at both? M. Luciano I agree with you I large, but I'm describing how it stands, rather than how it ought to go. Impulse_Vigil So much this. humulos No they don't. If they wanted us to they would have given Allo/Duo the same features that Hangouts has had. Total Insecurity It will have the same features, besides video chatting (But Duo covers that, so it's not a problem at all). Luxferro Can i call and text from my computer, and all my other android devices? Nope... This is the #1 reason it sucks and i'll never use it. humulos If it doesn't right now, then there's no reason to have released it as a finished app. No synced messages, no web app, no deal. Total Insecurity I understand your point. But establishing such features seems to be hard for Google while keeping the new ones. humulos Which is a problem. Apple releases new features for iMessage and Facetime without ever removing features, their users never have to worry about how they are keeping in touch because it's handled very well. Google acts like the products they make are just fun projects that they can start and stop at will without repercussion, which is a very frustrating mindset for users. Total Insecurity But Google has to make it compatible with millions of devices! That's a huge difference. So yeah, Apple can do Software, but just in their own hardware. Google can do almost both, software and hardware. h4rr4r So it lacking 1/3rd of the methods is the same features? I will just switch to skype. Total Insecurity Skype may have more features than Duo, but it certainly isn't as secure as Duo with its lack of end-to-end encryption. Duo on the other side has this encryption. 😎 h4rr4r I don't believe it. Unless it asks the user to provide keys the first time and a password each time it starts I just don't trust it. All of these services are more than happy to MITM your calls for anyone that pays. Total Insecurity That's a wrong mindset you got there. Google sells data, yes. But just data without connection to each other, also made private and different data to different companies, because that is how Google makes it money. It secures the data they have of people using their services and makes sure just tiny bits which cannot be connected to each other are sold for special companies. They wouldn't want to share with the CIA, for example, because the CIA could sell it on to others which are not trusted by Google and they could compromise user data (which would be the worst possible scenario for Google if it was made public!). So I am going to trust Google. Not completely. But in many situations. Nuno G. Sorry, but in my country no one is using Allo instead of Hangouts when they need "register" their mobile number to use it. I won't. They already use Messenger or WhatsApp for that. Beside that, the majority of average Joe android user in my country don't even use Hangouts, and no way they know that Allo even exists!!! Simple as that!!! Google has to merge every message app they own, Allo/Hangouts/talk/messages/Duo (did I miss another app?) in one single app!!!! wittyname9000 I wouldn't mind as long as I can login in on multiple devices including desktop. jcopernicus They're probably moving all the beanbags from the Hangouts team to the Allo team so they can get to work doing nothing. Álvaro B I guess, dunno. In the end, this is what happens when you try to force Google+ down everyone's throat and extend its slimy tendrils into every single service you have in catalog so people have no choice other than begrudgingly use it. Now it's taking them YEARS to undo all the mess and have services working mostly independently again. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes, they plan to release another messaging app next week to replace all those. J. Gilbertson **Looks at Google+ then to Google** Finish Him! 7-down You shut your dirty mouth, you peasant fool! ike3232 :( humulos Any chance that them doing away with this will improve functionality for Hangouts? SyCoREAPER Didn't you see the news? Hangouts is being further downgraded next month removing SMS functionality for non-Project Fi users. humulos As a Fi user, this is a horrifyingly realistic situation that keeps me awake at night. Impulse_Vigil They'll have to figure something out for Fi users before they ever take that away completely... Tho I can't see how outside of a separate app, unless Allo gets not just RCS support but true SMS fallback. Is there such a thing as an RCA only client? Not like they've even talked about RCS for Fi... jcopernicus It's amazing that Google Talk on Honeycomb has a better tablet layout than Hangouts on Nougat. Corbin Davenport Yep. And Hangouts on the iPad has a better layout, too. SyCoREAPER TF are you smoking? Corbin Davenport This is Hangouts on the iPad: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6d2ea586343e18d2c70fbe63f858149dd962d6214f30b80d72a44b5b913120e5.jpg And this is Hangouts on Android tablets: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ba9a6928ec2a5a70164dbb850b1505622f6ec18f9e88fe266d5a08de39215e2a.png jcopernicus It's even more hilarious, because Hangouts DID have a layout like that briefly on android tablets. Prezes Dyrektor Indeed it was there and then wtf happened? ArrTooDeeToo Hey, @LiamSpradlin:disqus , can you please use your Design Relation superpowers to help Make Tablet Apps Great Again? Seriously, I feel like Google doesn't understand that in order to encourage developers to make apps work well on tablets, they need to set the standard. How can Gmail be so awesome, and Hangouts is such a mess (yet the iPad has an awesome tablet experience)?? Sometimes I think Google has things so backwards. Adrian Meredith Then google remembered that it hates tablets and has seemingly gone out of their way to make them fail M. Luciano Tested more or less this layout on the Nexus 9 last year. Not sure why it never went live. Abhilash Bingi Coz Google doesn't give a shit about Android Tablets. Oh wait, maybe they do! They did move the navigation buttons to the edges! /s M. Luciano Yeah the 7.1.2 and O dev preview both brought some significant UI enhancements to my Pixel C... I think they have a direction for tablets, but tablets are being used MUCH more by businesses than by consumers for content consumption, other than the e-reader evolution devices. SyCoREAPER I have mixed feelings about it. Yea it's faster to switch conversation but it gives me nightmares because it looks like Facebook chat back in the day K77bkny Hilarious, freaking Google is run by the deaf, dumb and blind. Leeav Amar Most tablet-focused apps from the Honeycomb era were better than tablet-focused apps on Nougat now. It's as if Google cut their losses and admitted defeat after Honeycomb. ICS, JB, KK, LP, MM and Nougat all increasingly focused away from tablet-friendly design - that peaked with Android 3.2.6...Here's hoping Android 8.x.x change some things and that Google's own apps at least embrace that... Richard Branches I think Google Talk came too late when the hype for MSN Messenger was still going on and it didn't catch too many users when that service was shut down back in 2013 either... marmaduke25 Shame Quick Links lab setting for Gmail is being removed. I rely on it for saved mail searches. Is there an alternative? Willie D Google has lost its identity since Google Buzz and Google Wave. They have created things we need and use, then take them away, or worse, taken them away and brought them back to life in the convoluted way we used to use them before they were changed into something that was taken away. Google Voice-HangoutsSMS-Messages-GoogleVoice comes to mind. Miguel Angel I loved this in comparison to Yahoo Messenger. Gtalks desktop client was clean and simple. But everyone I knew back then used Yahoo.. JD It's Spring Cleaning over at Google, anything that once worked and works well must go go go to make way more for trash. Dennis Bareis They are getting rid of circles? Or is there an ability to email circles now? If they get rid of circles I'll probably stop using it. Wayne Moyer The way it reads they are only getting rid of circles access in Gmail but not in G+. They are continuing the separation of G+ from all of their other products. As a heavy user of G+ (we do exist) it was also something that caught my attention. Sir_Brizz Gmail never really leveraged them well enough, anyway. And Circles kind of got left in the dust for Collections anyway... Dennis Bareis I'm guessing you post public all the time. Collections and circles aren't even close to being related. Collections are a poor way of grouping items for readers (a post can ONLY be in a single collection) and circles is a way of controlling who can read your posts. Impulse_Vigil That's how I always understood it, and it's one of G+ true unique aspects. Too bad they never really advertised it well enough to catch people's attention... Sir_Brizz I do. I'm not saying Circles are useless but they did kind of get replaced by Communities and Collections. Dennis Bareis Thanks, GMAIL/INBOX needs a way to email groups of users. Is there another way to do the same thing? If so anyway to import that list from Google+? Ismael Rodriguez I can see Duo standing on it's own, barely, but I can see it. With allow, they should have waited until the G Suite split of Hangouts was done and then converted Hangouts into Allo; keeping the important features and just changing the layout, theme, and behind-the-scenes functions, so they can keep/transition their non-business consumer base using a single messaging app AND still have us happy with all the features we enjoyed. Now, please excuse me while I take a breather from that long ass run-on sentence. XD Sir_Brizz No because at I/O this year they are going to release Allo Spaces. Grey Google created a huge clusterfuck by not ending Talk instantly. For months after I had friends who were still on Google Talk - talking to friends still on Google Talk - and missing friends who switched to Hangouts to message them. At least now they make an entirely new chat service, so no one switches to it and can message their friends on it. It just means no one uses it. jaduncan > Google Talk's old XMPP support still remains in use today, because it's the only way to send and receive Hangouts messages outside of the official mobile apps and Chrome extension. Google says Hangouts will continue to support 1-on-1 chats with XMPP, but XMPP federation with other services will "no longer be supported" starting June 26. Google Talk XMPP federation was already de facto dead; pretty much all modern XMPP servers require encrypted connection, and the GTalk servers were on such an ancient codebase that they didn't support the XEP standards required. Craig Nelson I didn't even know G Talk was still alive? Wow, thought Google shut that down long time ago. Régis Knechtel https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b233b197af44ffa3889225d58263d87e1147fc4914911082a34095ae43e065d1.gif Michael Carr I got scared for a second. I've removed all Gapps from the KitKat ROM that I'm running on my tablet (an Iconia Tab A200), so I've been using Xabber to communicate with the few Hangouts contacts I talk to (at least, on that tablet). Nice to read that it's not a full death knell just yet. Bob Always wanted to ask Google or any expert here: 1) Why on earth did Google kill of something almost ubiquitous and well accepted like GTalk and confused their own users with Hangouts in the first place? I'll not even mention the unending list of communication apps they keep rolling out relentlessly. 2) Shouldn't GTalk be brought back - it was simple and fast and easy for anyone to use. I don't even 'get' Hangouts and never got on board with this one. 3) Did Google just miss a very big opportunity to rule the planet with a single neat communications app based on email .. had they nurtured Gtalk? I reckon it would have metamorphosis-ed into one of these G+ , Instagram like apps but missed a 'big' boat just like that .. poof!!! Its odd nobody mentions this lost opportunity. ultramodern I think it's because Google's Facebook obsession. It's so soar it did not invent it that it's desperately trying to mimic it. Bruce Salem Google should allow for Markdown Format, no matter what. It is essential that users be able to give feedback with quoting in reply. Most of social media's vulnerability to disasters like the one hitting You Tube and the fake news problem at Facebook is due to the lack of context quoting that would be enabled in any blog post the supports Markdown Format. Sergio Gonzalez-Del Pozo I personally don't use any of the apps, except for Gmail which I've been using since it first came out back in 2005, what really bugs me is being unable to remove all the extra Google apps from my LG Aristo Smartphone with Nougat 7.0, it's constantly updating these apps whether I want them or not. I should have some say in the matter, instead of just being on the receiving end without any control. Jason St Pierre Ending Picasa development was my biggest cry. I still use it everyday. They really need to keep that going it was really good for it feature set. ScottColbert It's like Google is just begging me to go to iOS. Jesus wept. h4rr4r They killed xmpp confederation years ago. Sadly XMPP is better than anything available these days. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "Alexa, what software or service did Google abandon this week?" Dang, she doesn't know.

You mean a native speaker of English. – tchrist♦ 15 hours ago      Thank you @tchrist – rafidkarim 15 hours ago 4   Death is taboo in most cultures, and by association so are most signs and symbols which correspond to death, like the word death. This is as true in English as it is in Chinese, whose elevators go from floor 2 to floor 3 to floor 3A to floor 5, because the word for 4 (shin) is homophonous with the word for death. In fact, euphemisms like late are consciously introduced specifically to avoid saying words like death. So which do you think is more common? – Dan Bron 15 hours ago 1   @DanBron Small niggle: ‘four’ is 四 sì (in Mandarin—different in other Chinese lects, but no final n in any of them), which is not quite homophonous with 死 sǐ ‘death’, but close enough to be taboo. – Janus Bahs Jacquet 14 hours ago      @More niggles There is no Floor 3A. Some elevators on Hong Kong or Taiwan simply skip the 4th floor or use it for maintenance equipment but even that is uncommon. – lly 12 hours ago  |  show 1 more comment 1 Answer 1 active oldest votes up vote 4 down vote Google has scanned an enormous number of books as part of its Google Books effort and has a Google Ngram Viewer service that utilizes that scanning effort to provide a means for determining the prevalence of words or phrases in all of the books Google has scanned with the limitation that results are only available up until the year 2008. Using that service, one can see that the phrase "my late brother" has been far more common, at least in books, than "my dead brother," though in recent years the difference in frequency is far less than in the 19th century. Graph of frequency of "my dead brother" compared to "my late brother" Though they have the same meaning, I would say that the phrase "late" is used more frequently than "dead" in other written media, including obituaries, to describe deceased relatives as well as in spoken conversations and I would attribute that discrepancy to the reason cited by Dan Bron in his comment and as noted in Euphemisms for Dead, Death or Dying: French writer and philosopher Voltaire said, "One great use of words is to hide our thoughts." This is a concise explanation of why people use euphemisms -- the substitution of an inoffensive word or phrase for something generally considered offensive or insensitively explicit. Because the reality of death and dying makes us feel uncomfortable, we often resort to various euphemisms to indirectly reference the inevitable end of the human condition. share|improve this answer edited 13 hours ago answered 13 hours ago Winter 4273      Thanks for the definitive answer and, as well, for taking the time to gloss the ngram project and clarify its limitations.

Gamers may recall Google Maps’ Pokémon Challenge three years ago, and they’re continuing from another novelty for this year’s April Fools’ Day. MS. PAC-MAN INVADES GOOGLE MAPS FOR APRIL FOOLS’ DAY Upon loading Google Maps, users will notice an option to insert a coin on the bottom-left corner of the browser. Moving your cursor over the arcade-inspired square will reveal a message: “READY!” Google Maps will then assess your location and retrofit it into a makeshift maze for Ms. Pac-Man to explore. All the core components from her solo outing are present: pellets, Power Pellets, fruits and the four antagonistic ghosts. Furthermore, the appropriate sounds are accounted for. Ms. Pac-Man begins with five lives, and clearing the screen of wayward pellets will send her to the next level. Those who wish to demonstrate their Pac-Man prowess can share their score via social media. Will you achieve a new high score? Ms. Pac-Man graced the world in 1981, and the story behind it is an interesting read. Nevertheless, while Namco wasn’t heavily involved in its development, Ms. Pac-Man is regarded as an excellent sequel to the groundbreaking original. Variety was added to the formula by giving players multiple mazes to play through. Chat With uInterview On Facebook! Get latest news, interviews and horoscopes delivered directly to your Messenger!

Top News Opinion Entertainment Taiwan Living Learn English E-Newsletter App International Edition Monday April 3, 2017 About Us Subscribe Advertise Contact Us Business Company Focus Africa Middle East Europe Americas Asia Global Markets CEO Talks Samsung's Bixby in tough challenge to rivals By Rob Lever, AFP  Monday, April 3, 2017, 12:07 am TWN SHARE CLOSE Blogger   Google+ Live Journal   Plurk Stumble Upon     Tweet A- A+ 中文 Washington -- Samsung's Bixby is the new kid on the block of personal digital assistants and is likely to face a rough reception in a neighborhood dominated by tech sector rivals. Bixby — introduced at Samsung's unveiling of Galaxy S8 smartphones — aims to help the South Korean giant break into a surging market for voice-activated virtual assistants, which includes Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, Google's Assistant and Microsoft's Cortana. The latest personal digital assistant distinguishes itself from competitors by using voice commands rather than touch to control handsets or applications, factoring in location awareness and image recognition. The integrated camera function allows users to identify buildings, such as popular tourist sites, to access their websites and other information simply by snapping a photo. The photo recognition technology can also help users decipher menus in foreign languages, or find places to shop for specific items they photograph. "It impressed me that they were doing image recognition and context awareness," said Bob O'Donnell, analyst and consultant with Technalysis Research, who attended the presentation. "It adds some new twists we haven't seen before," he said, noting Bixby's ability to make recommendations. Yet Bixby is still a work in progress — the virtual entity did not speak at the New York demonstration. It has yet to be infused with technology from Samsung's recently acquired Viv, a company founded by creators of Apple's Siri. "It's not talking yet," O'Donnell said. "They have room to expand and grow." Tough Competitors Bixby will face competition from established players — even from Samsung's own phones, where users can choose to use Assistant, Cortana or Alexa. Richard Windsor, an independent analyst who writes the Radio Free Mobile blog, said Bixby may face problems because the "best-in-class Google Assistant" will be on the home button of the new phone, which is powered by Google-backed Android software. That means Bixby has a "fearsome competitor" on its own flagship device, according to the analyst. "Bixby is trying to do things a little differently but careful assessment of what Samsung demonstrated shows a service that has very little intelligence at all," Windsor said. 1|2|Next Page>> NEXT ARTICLE Panama Papers: a boost to the battle over tax, but no silver bullet Facebook Twitter Google+ Write a Comment Terms Enter your comments - 3000 characters max Type in image code  Receive our promos  Respond to this email Submit MOST POPULAR OF THIS SECTION 1 Now that the US is out, Beijing authorities may be interested in attending TPP talks 2 Reports of TSMC's US plant rattle Taiwan 3 TSMC still considering plans for 3nm chip production 4 Why analysts believed TSMC was looking elsewhere 5 China trims 2017 growth target, warns against trade controls 6 Nintendo Switch console goes on sale across world 7 Invest in Taiwan, President Tsai urges Taiwanese businesses in N.

Benzinga News Desk     {{following ? "Following" : "Follow"}} April 02, 2017 1:17pm   Comments Share: Related P Recode: Pandora's 'Days Seem Numbered' And This Is Bad For The Music industry The Market In 5 Minutes The Vetr community has upgraded $P to 4.5-Stars. (Vetr) Related AAPL Apple iPhone 8 Build Reduction Rumors Aren't True: BlueFin How Companies Compartmentalize Global Regulators' Conflicting Demands This Top Stock Mutual Fund Cheers Retirement Investors With Gains (Investor's Business Daily) By Doug Sears Streaming music has been on the rise within the last decade, and so have prices. However, there is demand for affordable, competitive pricing. For just a Hamilton, the services profiled below offer such musical opportunities. Google Play Music Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)'s Google put its streaming app on a diet before updating in February, releasing an app that promises to take up less space on your phone than its bloated older versions. Functionality isn't complete yet, but it's also close to integrating with Google Clock to provide users with the musical alarms they have clamored for. The app includes 40 million songs available for a short-term download or for streaming on any device except a Windows phone, plus a great new "recents" feature if you're looking to replay a song you listened to recently. Uploading your own music to Google Play Music allows you to integrate your music, add it to the library and, if you have a bad file, they'll instantly upgrade you to a better quality version. Google Play Music costs $10 a month after a 30-day free trial, or $14.99 a month for a family of up to six people. Spotify Spotify continues to steer the ship in the streaming service industry, balancing the free radio and downloadable music models with a free and premium version. Spotify Premium costs $10, or $14.99 for a family of six on individual accounts. The service boasts 30 million songs, coming up a bit short of the 40 million boasted by Google Play music. A recent leak of plans for HiFi capability signals Spotify's intention to elbow its way into a segment that so far has been exclusive to Tidal — premium high quality content. Lossless audio through Spotify HiFi is currently available to a small group of test users and is projected to have a $14.99 or $19.99 price point. Spotify hasn't announced anything about HiFi; so all available information is based on users seeming to discover something on the current app, but if Spotify adds a HiFi element it will serve to increase their already dynamic streaming package. Amazon Music Unlimited Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN)'s Amazon Music Unlimited, a distinctly different entity than its Amazon Prime Music app, was released in the fall of 2016 for Prime users. The new app offers "tens of millions of songs," which is vague and hard to quantify but certainly a lot more than Amazon Prime Music, which only had around 2 million songs. Pricing for Music Unlimited is a moving target, with three different price points. The Echo plan costs $3.99, but is only accessible on an Amazon Echo, Tap or Dot device. If you don't own one of those devices or plan on using another non-Amazon device, you would need a $7.99 Individual plan, and then if you're looking for a family plan, one can be had for $14.99 monthly for up to six family members. Of course, all of these prices are on top of a required Amazon Prime membership, which costs $99 per year, or around $50 annually on a student plan. A non-prime used will pay $10 for the individual plan. Amazon Music Unlimited does grant the option for downloading tracks as well as access to Android, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), Sonos and BlackBerry Ltd (NASDAQ: BBRY) platforms, but the app has seen some bugs and difficulty finding more obscure artists even though their music is present on the app. Pandora Pandora Media Inc (NYSE: P) took the lead in the early days of music streaming, providing a useful function as an internet radio station. Excellent sound quality, lots of options and much needed legality allowed Pandora to make a big statement in the life of internet users after the illegal music heyday finally waned. But a stubborn insistence on the radio model allowed other players to jump past Pandora as consumers demanded the ability to select each song rather than be subject to the whims of an algorithm. But Pandora has announced a new streaming service on the way next month, set at a $10 a month price point that is familiar to the music streaming market. The new version, Pandora Premium, will finally allow users to make playlists, pick any song at any time and take their music offline. Essentially it does everything that Spotify has been doing for several years, as it and others have eaten at Pandora's market share. Pandora is relying on its superior interface and larger music catalogue to catch up to Spotify, Google Play Music and others with Pandora Premium, but as it hasn't released yet and is already quite late to the party, it remains to be seen. Pandora Plus, the ad-free version of classic Pandora that allows users as many skips as they like, is still a great value option at half the cost of most streaming services, but Pandora is still relying heavily on the success of Premium to get back into a race it once led. Soundcloud Soundcloud made waves earlier this year with the announcement of a segmented pricing approach to its service. Soundcloud now offers a $5 and $10 price point for monthly fees, as $5 subscribers forfeit access to music considered premium content. The lower priced version will be called Soundcloud Go, and the premium version has been named SoundCloud Go+. Go members will have access to around 120 million songs, primarily the mixtapes and amateur musical efforts Soundcloud is known for. The Go+ level music is not yet fully defined, but major artists' music is almost certainly destined for the premium level. Tidal Jay Z's much maligned pet project, the Tidal Music App continues to soldier on despite market scorn. With a narrow vision dedicated to premium and exclusive content, Tidal is attempting to redefine the streaming music game, with varying levels of success. Tidal hangs its hat on exclusive content from major artists such as Beyoncé and Kanye West selecting new material that won't be available on Spotify or Google Play Music for months after release. Beyoncé's much lauded "Lemonade" series of music videos are still a Tidal exclusive, but the vaunted Prince catalogue, a hot property after his untimely death in April of 2016, returned to Spotify and other streaming devices last month after an extended period of Tidal exclusivity. Still, Tidal continues to push the boundaries of streaming, even showing a live boxing match recently. Another signature Tidal element, its HiFi capability, has lost some of its sheen. Spotify announced intentions to release their own HiFi capability and bring CD quality sound to their users, and Tidal itself adopted a $9.99 pricing level for their Premium plan, which misses some of the exclusive content as well as the HiFi capability available with the Tidal HiFi plan.

You should care more about Google than Comcast. By Tom Galvin, opinion contributor - 04/02/17 01:00 PM EDT 15   © Getty Images Quick, now that Congress has voted to repeal Internet privacy rules for service providers, what can Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon do with your information that Facebook can’t do? The answer is nothing. That is why the outrage over the vote is perplexing. And it also speaks to a larger problem for Internet users when it comes to their privacy. The truth is, most consumers don’t have a clue what the companies they rely on to use the Internet can and can’t do with their data. ADVERTISEMENT What has sparked the furor is the prospect that Internet service providers (ISPs) can now sell your browsing habits to advertisers. In other words, ISPs would be able to do exactly what Facebook already can do. So why do we want to allow one set of rules for ISPs and the other for digital platforms? That is confusing for consumers and counter-productive.   In fact, an ISP probably has less usable data. To start, they only see a slice of your Internet usage. When you are home in the morning browsing the Internet, you are using your home ISP. Then when you are on the train on your way to work, you are using your cell phone ISP or the one your train provides. Then when you are at work, you are using your company’s ISP. In other words, your browsing history is spread over multiple ISPs. Now, compare that with operating systems or digital platforms. If you use Google’s operating system, or spend a lot of time on Facebook, it’s a veritable one-stop shopping when it comes to your browsing habits. I’m more worried about what Google or Facebook may do with my data than I am with what an ISP may do, in part because they have more data and have shown a great willingness to offer it to the highest bidder. But all of this misses the main point: as a consumer, we should have certainty that regardless of the technology or provider, my privacy preferences should be the same. I shouldn’t have to worry about it. That goes for whether it’s a service provider, a social media website, a digital platform, or an online retailer. I want consistent rules and an ability to specify what my privacy settings should be. That is what Congress should be acting on, or giving the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) the latitude to sort out and create rules that are easy to understand. If Congress took this step, then consumers wouldn’t have to take the costly step of purchasing and installing a virtual private network (VPN) or using a software program, such as Tor, to facilitate anonymous communications. That is not a good long-term solution because technology is continually changing and consumers shouldn’t have to spend hundreds of dollars for new devices with every new technology development. All of this comes as Americans are increasingly apprehensive about what is happening online. Between “fake news,” offensive content supported by mainstream advertising, and disconcerting developments like sexual assault being broadcast on social media websites, Americans see an Internet that seems out of control and taken over by bad actors. According to research by the Digital Citizens Alliance, a majority of Americans say the Internet is less safe than it was 5 years ago. Nearly half say they have been victim of a scam or fraud, had their credit card information stolen or someone had used their identity. It’s time to put the consumer first and make our privacy preferences consistent across all of the technology we use. By doing that, we put the power in the hands of citizens. We have already seen a move towards greater privacy protections in Europe with “right to be forgotten” rules, which enables citizens to demand that personal information about them be removed from Internet search engines. That’s not only an extreme approach, but once again it solves only part of a person’s privacy puzzle. Until we take a holistic look at privacy, we’ll continue to live in a no man’s land where consumers don’t really know what privacy protections they have. Hopefully once we get past the manufactured outrage from this congressional vote, we can get serious about privacy. Tom Galvin is executive director of the Digital Citizens Alliance, a coalition of consumers, businesses, and Internet experts focused on educating the public and policymakers on the threats people face on the Internet.

Visit Gordon Duff's YouTube Channel View Latest Posts >>> Intel Drop, April Fools Day Plus One and We’re all the fools By Gordon Duff, Senior Editor on April 2, 2017 …by  Gordon Duff, Senior Editor We’re going to cover a few things today, some not so related, thus this is an Intel Drop. Buckle in, here it comes. Ask yourself why you never see some things on video, why some things are never reported.  In Afghanistan, it is a death sentence to show the real war to Americans, not the fighting part, the heroin processing part, the dams built by USAID for poppy field irrigation or the shiploads of special fertilizer brought in through Karachi to grow the drug crop. Why isn’t there a single uploaded video on YouTube from the Greenzone in Baghdad or the American village near the Turkish border in Northern Iraq?  The US has built facilities all over Afghanistan, including luxury homes and there isn’t a photo anywhere.  It sure as hell isn’t to keep this from the Taliban who provided the workers that actually built the projects. Then we ask about how TOW missiles get to ISIS and al Qaeda, yet how they get there is a mystery.  If Saudi Arabia and Qatar are arming terrorists, and they are on a massive scale, lets invade them, take down their governments and drag their royal asses out of holes and hang them from lamp posts.  Want to find terrorist criminals in Afghanistan?  Try the US backed government, thieves and drug dealers, terrorists and gangsters and everyone in Afghanistan and the region knows it but there is a total blackout in reporting it except on VT. Were you aware Google is a major CIA contractor through their mercenary company Google Idea Groups run by Jared Cohen, who represented the Mossad with the Bush administration?  Wonder why VT is crushed by Google or their search engine, and they now run all search engines, have choked off every dissenting opinion except for “approved” fake news sites like InfoWars and Breitbart? What is the real “dark web?”  Its news and information censored by Google and the NSA, not crime.   Heart of Darkness Let’s name one of the most dangerous and sinister groups on earth.  Whenever anyone gets close to the real dark side, the fake news starts with their “Soros” chant. We’re going to take a look at a few of the media groups that can and on occasion do start wars, groups that could well parallel similar organizations whose leaders were brought before the tribunals at Nuremberg. Let’s take a look at something really rotten, a Google/CIA front called “Movements.”  You can find them at the website, Movement.org.  This is where the Syrian War came from, this is the gang that recruits and moves jihadists around the globe and coordinates NGO’s for moving illegal arms and producing propaganda on a massive scale. And, since it is “Google,” it controls the internet, controls all search engines and simply erases every attempt to “out” their games.  This is the gang that moved poison gas into Syria, ran assassination teams in Iran, killed hundreds in bombings in Damascus, Baghdad and Istanbul, oh and Paris too.  From, of all things, Wikipedia: In October 2008, Columbia University, the US Department of State, Google, Howcast Media and other media companies sponsored the inaugural Alliance of Youth Movements Summit. This event brought together digital activists, technology and media leaders, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and governments to convene, share best practices, and create a network of socially responsible Grassroots activists using technology for their movements and campaigns. Following the inaugural summit, Jason Liebman (CEO and co-founder of Howcast), Roman Tsunder (co-founder of Access 360 Media), and Jared Cohen (Director of Google Ideas at Google) co-founded the Alliance for Youth Movements. This organization was dedicated to identifying, connecting, and supporting digital activists at the annual summit and throughout the year. In December 2009, The Alliance for Youth Movements hosted its 2nd annual summit in Mexico City. This summit was sponsored by the US Department of State as well as other sponsors. The event convened activists and supporters interested in how social media and connection technologies were helping to combat violence, with a special focus on Latin America. In March 2010, The Alliance for Youth Movements hosted its 3rd annual summit in London, which was sponsored by the UK Home Office and other media companies. At the end of the summit, it was announced that the Alliance for Youth Movements was launching a new online hub for digital activism, Movements.org. In February 2011, Movements.org officially launched and the Alliance for Youth Movements re-branded itself as Movements.org. In June 2012, Movements.org formally became a division of Advancing Human Rights (AHR), created in 2010 by Robert L. Bernstein (the founder of Human Rights Watch and former President and CEO of Random House for twenty-five years). AHR focuses on freedom of speech, women’s rights and promoting the freedoms outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, particularly by leveraging the power of the Internet.[1] In August 2012, Movements.org in collaboration with Al Jazeera launched an interactive tool that tracks the defections of senior Syrian military officials, members of parliament and diplomats of Assad’s regime. The tracker was released on Al Jazeera.[2] On July 9, 2014, Movements.org launched as a marketplace site, where dissidents in closed societies could connect to legal, PR and technology experts in open societies.[7][1]Natan Sharansky said of the platform, “Too often, leaders of the Free World have proved to be a disappointment to today’s dissidents. The citizens of free nations don’t need to.” ___________ Let’s look at where this takes us.  Most of us know that Al Jazeera is a front for the Qatar royal family that funds al Qaeda.  Those who don’t know Human Rights Watch is dirty don’t pay attention either. Let’s take a second to look at Ronin Analytics, the cyber-warfare private contractor.  What the hell does this have to do with a youth charity? Then we look at Jason Liebman and “Howcast.”  This is a YouTube “instructional video” partner except that it isn’t.  In reality, Howcast is a CIA propaganda project tied to YouTube, another CIA propaganda project.  From Alternet: The U.S. State Department has announced it is sponsoring a “New Media Technology” delegation to Iraq to “explore new opportunities to support Iraqi government and non-government stakeholders in Iraq’s emerging new media industry.” Of all of the areas in Iraq in desperate need of attention, its “emerging new media industry” is not the one that pops to mind. Things like clean water, electricity, right of safe return for refugees and an end to the occupation seem more pressing than increasing Nouri al Maliki’s Twitter followers. But unfortunately, that’s how U.S. priorities in Iraq seem to work. Anyway, the super star tech delegation, according to the State Department press release, includes “a mix of CEOs, Vice-Presidents and senior representatives” from “AT&T, Google, Twitter, Howcast, Meetup, You Tube and Automattic/Wordpress.” Ever wonder who brings in the smoke machines and actors for those phony “White Hats” rescue videos in Syria that are usually filmed in Egypt?  This article by Liebman explains a version of reality: “IN 2007, COALITION forces found an Al Qaeda manual on how to be a terrorist. We said, ‘Hey, let’s create an alternate manual to use tools to promote nonviolent social change.’ So Jared Cohen, who was then at State [now at Google], and I launched Movements.org to bring together activists, NGOs, governments, and tech and media leaders to network and share best practices. We have a set of how-to guides — everything from how to anonymously post online to what to do if your Internet goes down. We tell people, you can use Tweet-to-Speak, which Google rolled out during the Egypt uprising, to dial in from a landline and tweet. We’re trying to provide the resources for activists to do what they’ve been doing for a while, but more effectively and faster.” How “nonviolent social change” turned into a civil war that has killed 500,000 is something you won’t find on Google.  Wonder why? Then there’s Roman Tsunder, from of all things, Huffington Post, a whitewashed version of something more interesting: Tsunder is the the CEO and co-founder — along with “Viva La Bam” executive producer and “Jackass” consultant Terry Hardy — of PTTOW!, an organization that attempts to convince artists and powerful companies to work as a team to reach goals that vary in detail but are united in their appetite. The specifics of what role PTTOW! plays in any of these deals is unclear — the partnerships are formed in highly private sessions — and that shadowy influence has earned the organization an air of mystery leading to suspicious publications filling in the gaps. Fast Company referred to the PTTOW! as the “illuminati IRL.” Forbes compared the organization to the “Bohemian Grove,” a legendary meeting place for the rich and powerful first started in the 19th century. But Tsunder argues that even the Bohemian Grove, a community that included many American presidents, has nothing on this new conclave. Then again, if you wanted to follow Facebook and their role in the election, the barrage of conspiracies and fake news, Pizzagate and more, you have to learn about the Edelman Company, the masters of social media propaganda.  Here Richard Edelman sells the cure and not the disease: BY RICHARD EDELMAN, PUBLISHED NOVEMBER 18, 2016 BuzzFeed released a story earlier this week showing that false election news articles outperformed real news on Facebook during the final months of the election. These false news stories generated more engagement on the social network than election stories from 19 major news outlets combined including The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Huffington Post, NBC News and others. The false stories ranged from the ridiculous to the scandalous, including an endorsement of President-elect Donald Trump by Pope Francis. One site alone had four stories that were shared 3 million times on Facebook, including one about Hillary Clinton selling arms to ISIS. At a press conference in Berlin on Thursday, President Barack Obama made an impassioned plea to get serious about fake news “in an age where there’s so much active misinformation.” “If we are not serious about facts and what’s true and what’s not, and particularly in an age of social media when so many people are getting their information in sound bites and off their phones, if we can’t discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda, then we have problems,” said the president. This false news trend has also moved into the corporate sector. PepsiCo* had to manage a mini crisis over the last week after a series of false articles on social media claimed that CEO Indra Nooyi told Trump supporters to “take their business elsewhere.” In fact, she said no such thing. Now Back to Kurdistan Few Americans get to see the real Iraq or Afghanistan. I was in Erbil when it was a ghost town, no sewers, bombed buildings, no water or electricity. Today it is a virtual Dubai with fine restaurants and an American city. There is a similar American city in Kabul with luxury villas and a lifestyle that allows the military brass and their fatcat contractor friends to live a life unthought of in America. At that time, the unexpected turn of the war had stopped the American city north of Erbil, which bled off the resources that would have restored water and sewer but instead was spent on a vast failed luxury condo complex with golf course. Not “tens” but hundreds of millions have been spent on luxury villas used by Americans who try to compare their time overseas with that of those fighting wars.  General Michael Flynn is one of these, a man who went to war much as Donald Trump has just without the gold toilets and the Russian mobsters downstairs at Trump Tower. When did it begin?  Was it Eisenhower during World War II with his love of Europe’s finest homes, the best wines and female companionship. In Vietnam, when General Westmoreland took over the French compound used by MSUG’s Wesley Fischel, as his headquarters, a world of air conditioning, flown in video taped TV shows and Michelin 3-star chef’s became the norm for American wars.  Congressmen lined up to visit Vietnam where US Special Forces recruited virgins from rural villages. During a “stand down” back in 1969 while BLT 1/26 was waiting for replacements after losses during Operation Defiant Stand, I witnessed a confrontation between ARVN forces and a “skivvy patrol” of Special Forces outside DaNang’s luxury “Puzzle Palace.”  Whether the fight was over the use of Vietnamese children for prostitution or simply over money, we will never know.  Frankly, this was typical “combat” in Vietnam for many. VT has extensive resources in both Iraq and Afghanistan.  We can’t begin to describe what goes on in Kabul, the money spent and the lifestyles maintained there. You wouldn’t friggin believe it. ____________ Related Posts: Intel Drop: Israel Unleashes WikiLeaks on Russia, Trump Removal Plotted Intel Drop: Amateur Hour has begun Intel Drop, December 13, 2016 Intel Drop, February 26, 2016 Will Trump Deconstruct Administrative-Bureaucratic State?

Bixby — introduced at Samsung’s unveiling of its Galaxy S8 smartphones — aims to help the South Korean giant break into a surging market for voice-activated virtual assistants, which includes Apple Inc’s Siri, Amazon.com Inc’s Alexa, Google’s Assistant and Microsoft Corp’s Cortana. The latest digital personal assistant distinguishes itself from competitors by using voice commands rather than touch to control handsets or applications, factoring in location awareness and image recognition. The integrated camera function allows users to identify buildings, such as popular tourist sites, to access their Web sites and other information simply by snapping a photo. The photo recognition technology could also help users decipher menus in foreign languages or find places to shop for specific items they photograph. “It impressed me that they were doing image recognition and context awareness,” said Technalysis Research analyst and consultant Bob O’Donnell, who attended the presentation. “It adds some new twists we haven’t seen before,” he said, noting Bixby’s ability to make recommendations. However, Bixby is still a work in progress — the virtual entity did not speak at the New York demonstration. It has yet to be infused with technology from Samsung’s recently acquired Viv, a company founded by Siri creators. “It’s not talking yet,” O’Donnell said. “They have room to expand and grow.” Bixby would face competition from established players — even from Samsung’s own phones, where users can choose to use Assistant, Cortana or Alexa. Richard Windsor, an independent analyst who writes the Radio Free Mobile blog, said Bixby might face problems, because the “best-in-class Google Assistant” is to be on the home button of the new phone, which is powered by Google-backed Android software. That means Bixby has a “fearsome competitor” on its own flagship device, he said. “Bixby is trying to do things a little differently, but careful assessment of what Samsung demonstrated shows a service that has very little intelligence at all,” Windsor said. Endpoint Technologies Associates president Roger Kay said Bixby might face challenges catching up with its rivals, which have been deployed for some time. “You can’t build these things overnight,” Kay said. “It would take years to create something as developed as Siri.” Still, he noted, it is important for Samsung to be in the game. “These are table stakes,” Kay said. “You can’t not deal with voice. It’s hands-free and can summarize a lot of things quickly.” Amazon appears to have impacted the sector the most with its connected speakers using Alexa. The service allows users a wide range of voice interactions for music, news and purchases, and connects with “smart” home devices. “Alexa is the top dog,” Kay said. “Amazon has done the best work from a commercial perspective. They took it out of the theoretical to put it to work for things people want to do.” Samsung has also promoted Bixby as a remote hub for connected devices, which is another challenge as it takes the software beyond the smartphone. Moor Insights & Strategy analyst Patrick Moorhead said Bixby’s success in the connected home might depend on how much data it can collect. 1 2 NEXT › This story has been viewed 1812 times.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple explores the use of Titanium, Titanium Alloys and Hybrid Plastics for Future Devices | Main April 02, 2017 Apple Patent Reveals a Visual System to Assist Siri in Future Devices to understand Gestures, Activities, & More   In December 2015 Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple Continues to Build a New Team that is focused on 'Deep Learning' Technology for Autonomous Vehicles." That was the first time we heard of Apple having a 'deep learning team.' While one of the projects related to autonomous vehicles, the team is obviously involved in a wide range of projects. Back in June 2016 Apple's Craig Federighi, Senior VP of Software Engineering for iOS and macOS went out of his way to show the advancements in Siri's ability to understand deep questions relating to Siri's new "deep learning" capabilities. Back in October 2016, Google delivered their manifesto on the arrival of the AI revolution.   So it is clear that the shift to deep learning systems using next generation user interfaces for Home and Vehicle Automation markets is where the next revolution rests.   While Google tried to plant a mental flag on deep learning being something that they were first to bring to market, I'm not quite sure that will stick. A Forbes article published last year attempted to frame this next revolution as one being led by Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon – leaving Apple out of the equation which couldn't have been further from the truth. Between Siri, their acquisition of Vocal IQ and their deep learning team in general, Apple is most definitely in the game if not poised to lead it in the future.   This week a master patent came to light regarding deep learning. A master patent usually covers a new area of technology with broad strokes to provide a grand overview of the subject matter. In the future new patent filings will then break out varying elements of the technology and elaborate on it in more detail and perhaps for specific products Apple has in mind.   Today's report is no doubt long, but it's because it's an overview of a new 'Intelligent System' that could be a part of a next-generation HDTV system, an advanced 'Apple TV' box, a Home specific device or a Mac down the road.   While the system will integrate Siri for voice, this week's patent is really about the brains and eyes of a future AI system. You may say 'Hey Siri' to get the systems attention or you'll be able to use a gesture to summon Siri or directly instruct the system to do something like answer your phone or start your car. The system will also perform advanced functions like adjust the audio of a movie or new Tune so that when you walk around a room the audio will be adjusted to your new position in the room; lower or raise the volume, base or treble as required to ensure the sound is optimal for the user.   Though in the end, the patent is really about giving eyesight to the new intelligent system via 3D cameras by Apple' acquired LinX that could fine tune the system's understanding of a gesture system tied to instructions or intent of the user.   Patent Background   Traditional user interfaces for computers and multi-media systems are not ideal for a number of applications and are not sufficiently intuitive for many other applications. In a professional context, providing stand-up presentations or other types of visual presentations to large audiences is one example where controls are less than ideal and, in the opinion of many users, insufficiently intuitive. In a personal context, gaming control and content viewing/listening are but two of many examples. In the context of an audio/visual presentation, the manipulation of the presentation is generally upon the direction of a presenter that controls an intelligent device (e.g. a computer) through use of remote control devices. Similarly, gaming and content viewing/listening also generally rely upon remote control devices. These devices often suffer from inconsistent and imprecise operation or require the cooperation of another individual, as in the case of a common presentation. Some devices, for example in gaming control, use a fixed location tracking device (e.g., a trackball or joy-stick), a hand cover (aka, glove), or body-worn/held devices having incorporated motion sensors such as accelerometers. Traditional user interfaces including multiple devices such as keyboards, touch/pads/screens, pointing devices (e.g. mice, joysticks, and rollers), require both logistical allocation and a degree of skill and precision, but can often more accurately reflect a user's expressed or implied desires. The equivalent ability to reflect user desires is more difficult to implement with a remote control system.   When a system has an understanding of its users and the physical environment surrounding the user, the system can better approximate and fulfill user desires, whether expressed literally or impliedly. For example, a system that approximates the scene of the user and monitors the user activity can better infer the user's desires for particular system activities. In addition, a system that understands context can better interpret express communication from the user such as communication conveyed through gestures. As an example, gestures have the potential to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks regarding user interface through conventional remote controls. Gestures have been studied as a promising technology for man-machine communication. Various methods have been proposed to locate and track body parts (e.g., hands and arms) including markers, colors, and gloves. Current gesture recognition systems often fail to distinguish between various portions of the human hand and its fingers. Many easy-to-learn gestures for controlling various systems can be distinguished and utilized based on specific arrangements of fingers. However, current techniques fail to consistently detect the portions of fingers that can be used to differentiate gestures, such as their presence, location and/or orientation by digit.   Computer or Entertainment System for responding to user Presence and Activity   Apple's invention illustrates the use of an intelligent system that responds to user intent and desires based upon activity that may or may not be expressly directed at the system.   The intelligent system acquires a depth image of a scene surrounding the system. A scene geometry may be extracted from the depth image and elements of the scene, such as walls, furniture, and humans may be evaluated and monitored.   Apple's filing notes that "In certain embodiments, user activity in the scene is monitored and analyzed to infer user desires or intent with respect to the system. For example, if the user is observed leaving the room, the output of the intelligent system may be paused." In context, Apple later identifies some of the hardware that this 'intelligent system' on pause is designed to work with: a television, a set top box, a multi-media entertainment system and general purpose computer system.   In addition, the scene geometry may be a factor in the system's response. As an example, if a user enters a portion of the scene with low acoustic reflectance, the audio volume of the system output may be increased to compensate for the relatively decreased acoustic reflection being experienced by the user.   In other embodiments, the intelligent system may determine that the user is attempting to engage the system to provide express instructions. If express instructions are interpreted, some embodiments contemplate slavishly following the express instruction, and other embodiments contemplate generally following the instructions, while, however, compensating based upon scene geometry.   For example, if user is detected as older in age and that user expressly requests a higher volume, the system may decide that the user requires better differentiation of voice dialog in the system output. Therefore, the system may change the relative spectral distribution of the system output (to relatively amplify voice) rather than increase the average volume.   Apple's invention covers concepts that provide a method to identify fine hand gestures based on real-time three-dimensional (3D) sensor data. The method includes receiving a first depth map of a region of space, the first depth map having a first plurality of values, each value indicative of a distance.   Overall, the invention pertains to systems, methods, and computer readable media to improve the operation of user interfaces including scene interpretation, user activity, and gesture recognition. In general, techniques are disclosed for interpreting the intent or desire of one or more users and responding to the perceived user desires, whether express or implied. Many embodiments of the invention employ one or more sensors used to interpret the scene and user activity. Some example sensors may be a depth sensor, an RGB sensor and even ordinary microphones or a camera with accompanying light sensors.   Varying embodiments of the invention may use one or more sensors to detect the user's scene. For example, if the system serves as a living room entertainment system, the scene may be the user's living room as well as adjacent areas that are visible to the sensors.   The scene may also be as small as the space in front of a user's workstation or the interior of a car.   In an even a small area adjacent to a user's smart phone or other portable device (to interpret user desires with respect to that device).   On the flip side, the scene may additionally be large, for example, including an auditorium, outdoor area, a playing field, or even a stadium. In sum, the scene may be any area where there is a value for intelligent systems such as computers or entertainment systems to interpret user intent or desire for system activity.   Many embodiments of the invention allow for direct user manipulation of the system either to operate system settings or to control an application of the system such as games, volume, tuning, composing, or any manipulations that a user might expressly desire from the system in use.   The intelligent system may also have device sensors which may include one or more of: depth sensors (such as a depth camera); 3D depth sensor(s); imaging devices (such as a fixed and/or video-capable image capture unit); RGB sensors; proximity sensors; ambient light sensors; accelerometers; gyroscopes; any type of still or video camera; LIDAR devices; SONAR devices; microphones, CCDs (or other image sensors), infrared sensors, thermometers, etc. These and other sensors may work in combination with one or more GPUs, DSPs or conventional microprocessors along with appropriate programming so that the sensor outputs may be properly interpreted and/or combined to contribute to the interpretation a scene and user activity within the scene.   Scene Geometry   In Apple's patent FIGS. 4a and 4b illustrated below we're able to see embodiments contemplate detection of the scene geometry by the system #405 or devices and equipment in cooperation with the system. One or more sensors may be employed to detect the scene geometry, which generally refers to the structure of the room in two or three dimensions.   For example, one type of scene geometry contemplated for embodiments of the invention involves determining or estimating the location and/or nature of each element in a space visually or acoustically exposed to the system (e.g. television, set-top box, a multi-media entertainment center or computer system). Thus, varying embodiments of the invention may determine or estimate the two- or three-dimensional position of vertical surfaces such as walls; horizontal surfaces #435, such as floors; furniture #410 or other chattel #440; fixtures #445; as well as living things, such as pets or humans #430. By understanding scene geometry, the system may provide a better experience for the user.   Apple notes that "Some embodiments employ one or more sensors to recover scene geometry. One type of sensor that may be used is a depth camera, which may serve as a type of depth sensor (e.g. cameras provided by LinX Imaging)." For the record, Apple acquired LinX two years ago.   At present, some depth cameras provide multiple sensing modalities such as depth detection and infrared reflectance. Depth detection recovers the existence of objects or portions of objects as well as the distance of the objects from the sensor. Thus, for example, referring to FIG. 4a, a depth detection of the scene taken from a sensor in the system should recover data representing the approximate dimension and location of: the three vertical surfaces 401 (walls) in front of the system; the horizontal surface(s) 435 (floor); the person 430; and separate parts of the furniture 410 (because varying parts of the furniture have different depths).   In addition to depth detection, some contemporary depth cameras also detect infrared reflectance. Information regarding infrared reflectance of an object reveals properties of the object including information about color. Information detected regarding infrared reflectance can be used with the depth information to aid in identifying objects in the room or potentially determining how those objects affect the use of the system in the scene (e.g., the effects on a user's perception of light and sound).   System Response   Under the section identified as 'System Response,' Apple notes that varying embodiments of their invention employ detecting user activity and/or the indicators of that activity in order to shape or alter a system service.   Audio service is one example of shaping or altering a system service in response to user activity. A user's perception of audio varies based upon the user's physical position with respect to the audio source(s). Changes in a user's location with a scene may cause variations in perceived volume or in the perceived balance of spectral components that arrive at the user's ears.   In the case of volume, there is a 6 dB drop in sound intensity (e.g., volume) for every doubling of distance from an audio source. Therefore, a user's distance from the audio source affects the volume of the sound that the user perceives.   In addition, even in an open room, only a portion of the sound perceived by a user travels directly from the source to the user's ears. Referring to FIGS. 9a and 9b below, simple examples of these concepts are shown. System #405 may radiate sound that travels both directly #950 and indirectly #925 to the user. Thus, by understanding scene geometry, the system may account for user location in adjusting both the spectral power distribution and the overall intensity of the audio.   In some embodiments, the intelligent system's understanding of scene geometry extends to the acoustic reflectiveness of the various surfaces, and this capability enhances the system's potential to refine a responsive adjustment with respect to both volume and spectral balance.   In some embodiments, the system may automatically adjust volume or sound intensity according to a user's position in the room. If the user becomes closer to an audio source, the intensity may be proportionally decreased. If the user moves further away from a source the intensity may be proportionally increased. The concept similarly applies to situations with multiple audio sources where each source may be altered accordingly or an overall average intensity (or other aggregating function) may be altered in response to user movements. In some embodiments with only one user in the scene the former arrangement may be preferred (i.e., volume of a source proportional to user distance), while in some embodiments with multiple users, the latter arrangement may be more desirable (i.e., average or aggregated volume proportional to average or aggregated distance).   Engagement Analysis   Under the section identified as 'Engagement Analysis' Apple turns to patent FIG. 11 noted above. There we're able to see a process for determining whether a user in the scene is engaged with the system (i.e., trying to communicate with the system).   The process of FIG. 11 illustrates the use of an RGB sensor and a depth sensor which are respectively employed for face detection #1120 and head orientation detection #1140. A registration is performed at #1150 to align the face detection results with the head orientation results. The registration provides information so that a more precise facial feature may be accurately paired with a more precise head orientation. This added information may be used during engagement analysis #1160 to more accurately determine if the user is engaging the system.   For example, if the user is speaking as the user's head orientation is moving toward the system, then the intent to engage is more likely. If the user is speaking as the head orientation leans toward another user, the user's intent is more likely conversation. If the engagement analysis determines that the user is not engaged #1170, then the system need not do anything #1180. If the engagement analysis determines that the user is engaged, then the system should respond. For example, if the user is asking to increase the volume, then the system should increase the volume. Some embodiments of the invention contemplate the use of learning loops #1165, which augment the engagement analysis with information learned from successes and failures in prior activity when responding or not responding. In some embodiments that employ learning loops, the system keeps a record of its engagement analysis and responsive action (or not).   Fine Gesture Detection   Under the section identified as 'Fine Gesture Detection' Apple turns to patent figure FIG. 14 where in one embodiment, 3D region #1400 is sensed by 3D image sensor system #1405 where region #1400 includes individual #1410 making a hand gesture and a depth of field #1515.   In Apple's patent FIG. 15 we're able to see a sensor data of region #1400 captured by the 3D image sensor system that may be analyzed slice-by-slice.   As shown, in some embodiments, each slice #1520 has overlap #1525 with an immediately prior slice and a thickness #1530. In general, the slice thickness should be "thick" enough to engulf an individual's hand or other target object but not so thick as to include an excess amount of other structure so as to make hand detection more difficult.   Three-dimensional sensor data acquisition in accordance with this disclosure may use any of a variety of optical and/or non-optical sensors. Optical sensors use light to carry depth information and include, for example, laser triangulation sensors and stereo vision systems. Non-optical sensors include acoustic (e.g., ultrasonic and seismic) sensors and electromagnetic (e.g., infrared, ultraviolet, microwave) sensors. These techniques typically measure distances to objects by determining the time required for a pulse of sound or electromagnetic energy to bounce back from an object.   Apple's patent FIGS. 22 noted above illustrates one approach to representing a hand's volume (depth map); FIG. 24 (right) shows, in block diagram form, a two-stage gesture classifier.   User Communicating with the System   And lastly, as we noted at the top of our report, Apple's Craig Federighi, Senior VP of Software Engineering for iOS and macOS spoke about Siri's new deep learning capabilities last year. Apple's patent filing published this week also acknowledges Siri as part of this next-generation 'intelligent system.'   Under the section identified as 'User Communication with the System' Apple turns Apple notes that a microphone or other audio sensor may be used to determine if the user is attempting to make voice contact with the system. The system may use voice analysis similar to that used in Apple's SIRI intelligent assistant in order to understand user utterances and decipher those that are directed at the system.   In some embodiments, the use of voice analysis may be constant so that all user voice is analyzed to determine context and/or to identify attempts to communicate with the system.   The use of voice analysis may be augmented by the use of other sensors. A depth camera, a LIDAR, an RGB sensor, or ordinary camera images may be used to analyze user body movements in order to determine when a user's utterances are most likely directed at the system.   Rather than constantly performing voice analysis on user speech, some embodiments may only analyze a user's speech when a sensor detects that the user appears to be addressing the system (e.g., that the user is engaged).   In yet other embodiments, a particular pre-set physical user action may tell the system that the user is addressing the system, so that voice analysis may be used. For example, the user may: employ a hand gesture like a peace sign; raise a hand as in a grade school class; hold one eye shut for more than a few seconds; or perform any reasonably distinct physical action.   In a similar fashion, the voice analysis may be constantly monitoring the scene but looking for a key word or words to trigger a communication session with a user. For example, the voice analysis may scan for the name Siri, or "hey Siri."   In any event, once the system recognizes that the user desires to communicate, the communication can take place in any known manner. Differing embodiments of the invention may employ voice recognition or gesture recognition or a combination of both techniques.   Apple's patent application was filed back in Q3 2015.

Samsung's Bixby takes on Siri and co Technology Sunday 2 April 2017 - 4:49pm Sriram Thodla, senior director of services and new business at Samsung, speaks about the new voice agent named 'Bixby' that is featured on the new Samsung Galaxy S8 during a launch event, March 29, 2017 in New York City. Photo: AFP/ Drew Angerer WASHINGTON - Samsung's Bixby is the new kid on the block of personal digital assistants and is likely to face a rough reception in a neighbourhood dominated by tech sector rivals. Bixby - introduced at Samsung's unveiling of Galaxy S8 smartphones - aims to help the South Korean giant break into a surging market for voice-activated virtual assistants, which includes Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, Google's Assistant and Microsoft's Cortana. The latest personal digital assistant distinguishes itself from competitors by using voice commands rather than touch to control handsets or applications, factoring in location awareness and image recognition. The integrated camera function allows users to identify buildings, such as popular tourist sites, to access their websites and other information simply by snapping a photo. The photo-recognition technology can also help users decipher menus in foreign languages, or find places to shop for specific items they photograph. "It impressed me that they were doing image recognition and context awareness," said Bob O'Donnell, analyst and consultant with Technalysis Research, who attended the presentation. "It adds some new twists we haven't seen before," he said, noting Bixby's ability to make recommendations. READ: Samsung voice-assistant Bixby to debut with new phone Yet Bixby is still a work in progress -- the virtual entity did not speak at the New York demonstration. It has yet to be infused with technology from Samsung's recently acquired Viv, a company founded by creators of Apple's Siri. "It's not talking yet," O'Donnell said. "They have room to expand and grow."  Tough competitors  Bixby will face competition from established players, even from Samsung's own phones, where users can choose to use Assistant, Cortana or Alexa. Richard Windsor, an independent analyst who writes the Radio Free Mobile blog, said Bixby may face problems because the "best-in-class Google Assistant" will be on the home button of the new phone, which is powered by Google-backed Android software. That means Bixby has a "fearsome competitor" on its own flagship device, according to the analyst. "Bixby is trying to do things a little differently but careful assessment of what Samsung demonstrated shows a service that has very little intelligence at all," Windsor said. Roger Kay of Endpoint Technologies Associates said Bixby might face challenges catching up with its rivals, which have been deployed for some time. "You can't build these things overnight," Kay said. "It would take years to create something as developed as Siri." Still, he noted, it is important for Samsung to be in the game. "These are table stakes," Kay said. "You can't not deal with voice. It's hands-free and can summarise a lot of things quickly." READ: Apple, Samsung vow to fix flaws after CIA hacking report Amazon appears to have impacted the sector the most with its connected speakers using Alexa. The service allows users a wide range of voice interactions for music, news, purchases and connects with smart home devices. "Alexa is the top dog," Kay said. "Amazon has done the best work from a commercial perspective. They took it out of the theoretical to put it to work for things people want to do."  Beyond the phone  Samsung has also promoted Bixby as a remote hub for connected devices, which is another challenge as it takes the software beyond the smartphone. Patrick Moorhead, analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy, said Bixby's success in the connected home may depend on how much data it can collect. "Machine learning gets better the more training it gets and the more data it gets," Moorhead said. While Bixby cannot benefit from the large databases of competitors Apple and Windows, it could potentially sync with Samsung electronics and smart home appliances through Samsung's SmartThings platform. "Samsung ships so many devices from phones to Chromebooks to washing machines, it is picking up a different set of information, so it might end up being smarter than Siri," he said. "Siri doesn't know what's in your refrigerator, Samsung does." The app faces an uphill battle in a fragmented market where competing platforms don't always work together. Moorhead said tech companies are jockeying for a position in order to "get access to data - by using this interface they can build detailed profiles on you."     AFP Comment Now!

Both devices are not included in Google's "final release" list for 7.1.2. We're expecting to launch the final release of the Android 7.1.2 in just a couple of months, Like the beta, it will be available for for Pixel, Pixel XL, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus Player, and Pixel C devices. Google generally doesn't comment on specifically which updates will EOL a given device, but both the 6 and 9 are past the end of the support windows published by Google - October 2016. It's not surprising, of course, but it's still noteworthy. Ars Technica received explicit confirmation of the devices' EOL status.

Got tired of only 2 year's life updates or less, normally one update and you can say thanks... Zsolt V Can you please rephrased that last sentence. No idea what your are trying to say. Kekinash Yeah, I didn't get it too, I said normally most android devices outside the Google branded ones get one upgrade, v5 to v6 or v6 to v7, during their life. Alejandro With "and you can say thanks" he means that you should be thankful...meaning that in the best scenario you will get just one update, thank them for it (it's kind of like an irony I think) Duder12 Your Nexus 6 is getting another year of security updates. What will you do when Google releases their own processor and supports their phones for 5 years? Leo He's trolling. He's basically saying he swapped out a phone he can basically continuously update via XDA for a device that will get incrementally feature-deficient updates and that he ditched an ANCIENT and CHEAP tablet for an uselessly expensive iPad that pales in comparison to an HP X2, Surface Pro or God forbid the Surface Book. Well, either trolling or he really is missing a few gears. Kekinash Yeah, under Windows you have plenty of apps... I already give away a Surface tablet, nice hardware, crappy store...Good for work, useless as a entertainment device. Yeah, I missing plenty of gears, me and million people... Leo Um, because you omitted the S? Moreover, care to explain just how in the seven hells would be useless as an entertainment device when you literally have access to every codec/player in the world? It just makes no sense. pfmiller Google support a phone for 5 years? Dream on. Lee Yet they still update that crappy Nexus Player, right okay. Thank god for custom ROMS, since that'll will give N6/9 owners 7.1.2 Carson Saldanha Haha, I'm saying... UniBroW Honestly, I am so tired of shelling out hundreds for a new phone seemingly after I finally pay it off. I think my next phone may finally be an iPhone which makes me cringe a little at the thought of it. Zsolt V Sounds good. Enjoy your dongles and your years worth of updates*. * Some features maybe missing. Duder12 Nexus 6 still has another year of security updates. meet2x4 Trust me you'll be just as let down with iPhone's, after Apple touted tons of cool features for iOS 4 then turned around and said it requires an iPhone 4 I couldn't sell my 3GS fast enough. Leo Good luck. Had an iPhone 7 for a month while setting it up for a coworker, it drove me to near desperation by how overly simplified and barebones it is. MJ No surprise... They will still get security updates for almost a year yet. Anyone that really cares about Android updates will see this as the time for a new phone/tablet or to put a custom ROM on it. I am not saying Google shouldn't provide Android updates for longer but it's not the end of world and the devices will still work. Neither devices were Google's finest efforts anyway as it was disappointing year for hardware from them. Curtis Bond Spoken like a rational human being. Am I sure this is Android Police? Chris They fucking botched my speaker phone. I want it fixed if I am not getting 7.1.2. Duder12 Security updates include bug fixes. Kyle Lyles Never had the problem with Pure Nexus ROM. 10 minute flash with Nexus Root Kit. Lateef Alabi-Oki These are perfectly capable and functional devices that Google has now artificially rendered obsolete. I'm never recommending Android devices again. No wonder they can barely sell phones. catalysto How are they obsolete? Do they magically stop working? Lateef Alabi-Oki When has obsoletion ever been associated with whether a product works or not? Duder12 The Nexus 9 was obselete the day it was released. Have you ever even used one? Terrible device. Lateef Alabi-Oki I sold mine for a Pixel C. Which will be obsoleted next year by Google. That's why the value of Android is less than a two-dollar hooker. Duder12 Than you should know the Nexus 9 is not a capable or functional device. Also a device that gets security updates is not obsolete. It is not getting the feature and maintenance updates. It is still going to see the security patches. Lateef Alabi-Oki How about bug fixes? How about performance optimizations? How about battery life improvements? If anything the Nexus 9 needs these more than any of the supported devices. So you're making my point for me. Duder12 Nexus 9 can't be fixed with software and Google has already proven they do performance and bug fixes in security updates. Here is a PERFECT example https://www.google.com/url?url=/amp/s/9to5google.com/2016/03/08/google-ota-update-fix-nexus-5x-performance-issues/amp/&rct=j&sa=U&ved=0ahUKEwi13v3bi-vRAhXF6IMKHTg9DxAQFggpMAI&sig2=ajN55II2iH_V0nz1yUtwhw&q=nexus+5x+security+update+fixes+performance&usg=AFQjCNHOs6C7kHRsopuAeysi-74YP_i9PA Lateef Alabi-Oki It doesn't change the fact that their still security updates especially to the archictecture of Android that can't be fixed by pluging monthly vulnerabilities. For example, Nougat is vastly more secure than Marshmallow because of changes to the underlying OS architecture. That's something that can only be addressed by a maintanence or OS updates as opposed to monthly vulnerability patch. And with all the security nightmares going on in Android land today, we need more commitment from Google in terms of OS, maintanence, security updates, not less. catalysto Just now. Lateef Alabi-Oki It's never too late to learn something new. catalysto My thoughts exactly. Duder12 Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 are getting security updates still. This is just feature updates My name is…. So what if it gets security updates? Duder12 Security updates are far more important than feature updates. My name is…. No, for me they are equally important Sruly J So... You're not recommending an entire OS because of what is being done by Google? Sounds logical. /s Carson Saldanha I mean, to be fair, Android is controlled by Google, so... Lateef Alabi-Oki Google was the only Android vendor I trusted to do right by their customers. But it's becoming evident that they're just as shitty, and only marginally better, than the other Android vendors. Sruly J Again, I fail to see how the actions by one OEM (because that's what they are in this case) are enough to warrant not suggesting ANY products from the ecosystem. Besides, other vendors have broken promises or adhered to 2 years of major OS updates. The Nexus 6 was released in 2014 and got major updates for a little over 2 years. Lateef Alabi-Oki The ecosystem has a reputation of being insecure and lacking longterm support for its hardware products. Google was always heralded as the only Android vendor that actually cared enough about it's users to support their hardware via regular OS, maintenance, security updates. As a result, the only Android devices I've only ever recommended have been Nexus or Pixel devices for this reason. Today, however, I'm no longer recommending ANY Android devices. Because Google seems to be just as cavalier about the long-term support of their products as all the other shitty Android vendors. If the Nexus 6 is capable of running this maintanence release, and it is, there's no reason why Google shouldn't continue to support it. Apple still supports devices they made much earlier than 2014. So does Microsoft. Heck even third party Android ROM developers with significantly less resources than Google find ways and means to support devices that are that old and even older. So stop finding baseless excuses for Google. Also, I don't give a shit about other Android vendors. That's why I don't buy their products. (The only exception being Nvidia with Nvidia Shield TV. Because they've earned the reputation of supporting their products.) Duder12 Again you are ranting and it doesn't make sense. Your complaint is about Android security and the Nexus 6/9 are both going to continue to receive security updates. Lateef Alabi-Oki The security patches that plug vulnerabilities are not as profound as architectural patches that prevent security vulnerabilites in the first place. There's a reason Nougat is considered more secure than Marshmallow with the latest security patches. Sruly J 1. I NEVER said I agree (or not) with the 2 year major OS update policy by Google. 2. Most of the complaints I see for people complaining about the OS being insecure are either from people who grant admin permission to shady apps which have no reason to request it, or they get cracked apps from shady websites. 3. Google, like any other OEM is in it to make money. And they get a lot of their revenue from ads/searches. The difference between Google and other OEMs though, is that other OEMs have broken promises for update support time, or have dropped support after a year or 2. Google however, has followed their promises of 2 years of major OS updates, with an additional year of security updates. They haven't broken that promise. 4. Just because a device COULD run certain software, doesn't mean it SHOULD. (Just ask @Corbin Davenport:disqus about if Windows was stable on Android Wear.) Lateef Alabi-Oki Okay, I'm glad you're satisfied with the status quo. I'm not. And I will be putting my money where my mouth is with my next phone purchases and recommendations. Sruly J Again, I never said I was satisfied. I'm just saying that Google is keeping the status quo exactly where it is. Lateef Alabi-Oki And I'm insisting that Google should and can do better. And until that happens I'm investing elsewhere. Atoqir I agree with all your points. I understand and am okay that most OEMS only support their flagship hardware for 2 years maximum. But as platform distributor Google should give this example how it should be done. So what we got is basically the same hardware as from other vendors with the same support as other vendors. The only "benefit" is you get new updates quicker the first 2 years, which isn't even a plus since the .0 releases sometimes still have serious issues. As a Samsung user I was always thinking "my next phone will be a Google phone". But at this point there aren't really any benefits anymore to buy another Samsung, LG or another brand. Pedro Google has a published update schedule for devices. They abide by it. Sometimes they exceed it. You are going to abandon an OEM because they actually meet the published update schedule? Will your wrath posts include "Google has done exactly what they promised! For that reason, I will never recommend them to the masses! My word has SO MUCH IMPACT on sales!" ? Just curious. Lateef Alabi-Oki No, I'm going to abandon them because I expect better from them. And I'm sick and tired of seeing Android vendors just abandon their products and customers with no care or reason. Apple would have supported the Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 until they were practically impossible to support from a software perspective. That's the kind of company I want to invest my money in. Cakefish iPhone 5 still gets updates to this very day. pfmiller Their published update schedule is inadequate. There's no reason they can't provide longer support for the devices. SmashleyFC Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Quinton I love my Nexus 6, especially with 7.0 and above. I'm not too upset about the end of updates - you know what you're getting with an Android phone and what we were getting with Nexus devices. With that said... I need that speakerphone bug fixed. https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=231764 My phone is rooted now, but that isn't always an option when you use BYOD for work... Testraindrop Nice move Google, perfect role model for OEMs *thumbs up* If Google can't manage to deliver a +0.0.1 update to their own "Google experience" devices, why should OEMs even bother? After two Nexus devices my decision is made, why should I bother with Google devices, if I can get better hardware from other OEMs for less money and go the custom ROM route to be up to date in a few years like I would also need to on Google phones anyway... Btw. my Nexus 5 is on 7.1.1, how hard can it be, Google? Pedro Not REAL hard, but not worth providing support to millions of devices. Let the user figure it out on their time. Duder12 It's very hard if Qualcomm doesn't allow it. Unofficial Roms are not the same reality as what Google had to deal with.. modplan He meant the NAND Flash...not Adobe Flash. Duder12 What the hell are you talking about? Renaldi I. Probably replied to the wrong thread; some person mixed the two up somehow in a reply to you Kyle Lyles I did, see my other post above. I've owned 14 Android phones including my wife and son. Both of them are on iPhone 7 Plus now. Phaaaaaauck Google! Lars Jeppesen But those phone don't run Nougat very well... Marek Bujko Google have bad support then. Apple support 17 model devices + 4 customized OS model devices on new iOS 10 invinciblegod God, the Nexus 9 is the worst performing tablet I have ever bought (I do not buy cheap crap tablets). I don't know who to blame, HTC or Google, but the fact of the matter is it was never fixed and now is still dog slow. I'm ;leaning on blaming HTC because my 6P is just fine. Never buying an android tablet again. Duder12 IMO the processor and flash couldn't handle the encryption. 2GB RAM didn't help.either ThatsMrtoyou Nexus 6 has 3 GB of RAM. Processor can handle it with no problem. Flash was phased out due to HTML 5 Duder12 We're talking about the Nexus 9. Not the Nexus 6. Read the posts. Renaldi I. SMH.. that's the wrong kind of flash. We're talking about flash memory, the storage chips on phones. There's more to what Duder said about the processor. The reason he mentioned the processor is because older processors handle encryption less efficiently than newer processors found in phones like the 810, which may have been a consideration for Google to stop supporting it. Duder12 Thank You eszklar You've never enjoyed the 2012 Nexus 7 tablet have you...... LaserWraith I have made terrible purchases regarding tablets. I got both the 2012 Nexus 7 and the Nexus 9...for some reason I never stumbled across enough bad reviews until after I bought them. :x Master Yates What links both your bad purchases is Nvidia. The Nexus 4, 5 and 7 (2013) are Snapdragon and all fantastic. Orlando aka Pixel XL This is true, the pixel c is the best tablet...My Nexus 9 was so laggy... Carson Saldanha Pixel C should've ran Chrome OS Orlando aka Pixel XL This is true. LoL, I'm happy with it..I got it for $475.. Carson Saldanha Still kinda a rip off considering you have the new Samsung Chromebook starting around the same price point and you get a actually full-fledged browser. Orlando aka Pixel XL I personally don't need a keyboard because I have a surface pro 4 and I use it for programming, this it comes in handy for simple things. A Person Detachable keyboard? Duder12 Why? It's an awesome tablet the way it is. eszklar In XDA/LineageOS I trust....... Duder12 The Nexus 9 is the shittiest tablet I have ever used. The Pixel C is the best tablet I have ever used. Orlando aka Pixel XL True day! Me too.. Master Yates I've got a feeling the Pixel C will start to suffer in the future. Only 3GB of Ram will be the bottleneck. Kacho_ON That just means the 6P and the 5X are next on the chopping block. Lord Argyris Hopefully not too soon. The 5X and 6P were new in autumn of 2015. Two years of support should give them until autumn of 2017, at which point I'll either flash a custom ROM on my 5X, or else take a look at the market if I feel like I need a new phone. Since my 5X is working perfectly for me now, and since I don't see anything to indicate that won't still be the case later on this year, I plan on holding onto it for as long as I can. Mehdi Yes, they have about a year, but still, "the next on the chopping block". 03grunt I still have not received the 7.1.1 OTA. I am not rooted and bootloader is locked. What should I do? Vivek Rameses Flash the image. Simple. Jeff72 https://developers.google.com/android/ota#shamu KH I still have the N9. Been ready for a tablet upgrade for a while, with no luck. Now my tablet is being phased out without any option for upgrade? Duder12 Pixel C Ricky Giordano Google Pixel C from Google is pretty much the best worthy successor to the N9 but at a cost Carson Saldanha Even that only has one more year of OS upgrades. You're better of getting a convertible Chromebook with Android apps. Ricky Giordano True, but havent there been rumors here and there of a worthy Pixel C successor with an Hybrid os of android and chrome os? Carson Saldanha rumors. Duder12 2 years of security updates. It's a great tablet but at this point one should only pay 400 for it. Brian Lippman I'm getting a Chromebook next. With them being able to run Android apps now, and seeming to just run better in general, plus there being more of them and usually cheaper than Android tablets, they seem to be the better choice (and Google is probably using them to phase out Android tablets in general). Duder12 Nah Andromeda will be on new tablets/convertables Orlando aka Pixel XL I'll sell mine if anybody wants one; Nexus 6 32 GB unlocked from Google, cloud white in decent condition, no cracks, just wear and tear, $200.00 triangle8 I'm still stuck on Android 6.0 on the Nexus 6. I guess no OTA is coming... Carson Saldanha Have you joined the Beta? android.com/beta Sruly J Did you ever try manually checking for OTA? Also, you could always just flash the OTA image and you won't lose data. mrjayviper but surely Google would've perfected OTA updates after years of experience. These phones were sold at carrier stores in my country. Normal consumers shouldn't have to go through a flash process to get updates! Sruly J That first line made me chuckle. Mike FaJohn Honestly the nexus 6 is by far the greatest and most reliable phone I have ever owned. After countless headaches with Samsung and HTC, It has been like a breath of fresh air. Not only has it been rock solid and stable, it has held up to the test of time and survived the rigors of my daily work like where other phones have crumbled and broken. I abuse my Nexus 6 and the harder I work it, the more I love it. I am not that upset that it has reached the end of its distribution cycle. Honestly going from Android 5 to Android 6 all the way to Android 7 has been more than I could have ever expected and I plan to hang onto it until Google releases another Nexus or Pixel device that I feel is a worthy upgrade. Steve McQueen I miss my N6. It was a great phone, the Moto hardware at the time was top-notch. Even the camera got pretty good with HDR+. Mostly though, I just miss that huge screen and front stereo speakers. Moto X Pure Edition was the closest I had to the N6, but Lenovo had to screw it all up and fudge up the updates. JohnnyRockets Agreed. I hate that the new Pixels have small screens and no dual front facing speakers. And that it's nearly $1000 of course too. I've had my Nexus 6 for 2 years next month and still love it. Kyle Lyles Amen! And I've owned 14 Android phones (including wife and son) Felix ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Galaxy Wife and HTC Son? Brownsville#72 Agree 💯. I have a Nexus 6. Next Google phone purchase when they have a phone that gets updates pass 2 years and not up to 2 years. Michael Jerch Same. My only complaint is that the camera was unusably slow in HDR mode after a few shots. Ended up sending it to Gazelle, but then they offered me $10! So I got it back and couldn't be happier. It's now my bedside "reading internets before sleepytime without having to worry about charging my primary phone for tomorrow." Gosh I miss that screen. Enormous screen with minimal bezels, sorry/not sorry. Great phone. blindexecutioner We have to stop supporting this 2 year garbage. These phones could easily last and run the latest OS for years. Duder12 Google doesn't make all the hardware and it's not only up to THEM. There are other players involved. Shawn Kovalchick Hopefully they will move in that direction with the Pixels. VAVAMk_2 I am rooting for Google going towards custom silicon (their own designed SoC) down the road. Eff Qualcomm. Knowledgeborn Allah All of those software updates aren't dependent on newer hardware. That idea is complete nonsense. They could easily add in the software features based on older hardware components, just like Apple does when they update the iPhone 5 - the same way custom ROM developers update older devices. Google just won't push out the updates because they expect their consumers to buy new devices every 2 years. Nicholas Conrad But if they open-source the hardware it gives ROMers total access to implement new features down to the silicone level. XDA FTW. K.P. Smith I read somewhere that it's less of a Google thing and more of a Qualcomm thing. My understanding is Qualcomm will only provide the necessary (updated) blobs/libs for a SOC for 2 years. Because after all they want you to buy their new chip. Unfortunately that leaves the manufacturer (Google/lg/Huawei) only able to support the device for as long as the SOC manufacturer will. It's my understanding that this is why Apple is able to update their devices for so many years because they design and own their own SOC. So they can update it until the software will no longer run. Take it with a grain of salt. I'm sure each side has their own story ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Carson Saldanha Understandable, but a 7.1.x update that just fixes bugs and optimizes performance should easily be able to run on a Nexus 6/9. Duder12 You don't know that's all it does until people dive into it. It says carrier enhancements. Bewear Carriers. Ugh. bekifft It's about time they made things easier for those poor carriers. They do so much for everyone and ask so little in return! Bettysbates Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours and have longer with friends & family! !mj142d: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks..

Boolean Corporation If the changes and optimizations require an x64 chip, then you're out of luck. It'd be merely a nominal change and not an update at all. Anzhel Bozhinov Nexus 9 has ARMv8 cores. JW I am trying to understand this reasoning. Are those libs like hardware drivers for PC? If so why do they need new drivers for a 0.0.1 update? e.g. new version of Windows can generally use last version's drivers. Duder12 Android != Windows Gregory Android == Linux, which means it's even easier to fix something that ends up broken after you update the system but use the old drivers. Renaldi I. If this was like desktop Linux you'd be correct. Unfortunately, the way Android chose to implement drivers, and the architecture they chose, complicates this much more, to the point where phones rarely see a kernel update. Gregory So you're saying they aren't just statically linked kernel modules as I used to think? Roh_Mish Technically, they are. Think of them as two objects, they have pipes for substance (data) to pass. If these holes align, well and good. But if they don't allign you can't use those pipes. Roh_Mish This. And OEM still release phones on 3.16 and 3.18 till now. Both are still supported long-term but they are old. 4.x has been around for a while now. Roh_Mish You could use older binaries but the locked down nature of ARM architecture and other chips commonly used in phones (qcomm, bcm) it is hard to do so. What driver essentially is just an mediator. For example you want to use the vibrator, you just pass the time period, strength and other values it requires to the driver and then the driver actually takes care of lower level things like power management to the motor, etc. Same with say flashlight (often included in the camera lib). You (the Android system when you tap the flashlight toggle) just say turn on flashlight at brightness 30% and the driver does the rest. Now here lies the problem. Like until L/M (i don't remember) we didn't have a dedicated camera button and since the core OS didnt had it, neither did the binary (all flashlight applications hooked into camera and turned on the light through that) but now you need to have an call just for flashlight because reasons (both because the camera hack isn't quite good and because Google says so). Now OEMs can't use the camera trick because Google won't certify it and the camera assembly manufacturer isn't updating the binary driver blob meaning you can't have flashlight. Custom roms on other hand can use the camera trick that other apps already use. It isn't as clean but it works. The same issues lies with more critical systems like how the modem and display management and the processor itself works. Even if the OEM wanted, if there isn't a proper driver, they can't do anything to offically update the phone with gapps certification. Note: I am oversimplifying it for understanding of how things work at higher level. This is NOT how things actually work word to word. There are a lot more steps involved. Nicolás embedded systems =/= general-purpose systems. That's why Gregory As if it isn't possible to build a ROM with the last SOC manufacturer drivers available. I mean, you don't need updated drivers for every new system release. Custom ROM developers can manage that, I can't imagine that a company as big as Google can't. So it's a purely bullshit excuse to me. F4uzan They can manage that, but if you're familiar with the custom ROM development scheme, it involves *lots* of hackery. Just as an example, the Nexus 4 can run Android N, sure, but it requires audioserver and mediaserver to be tied together, severely weakening security of the system. Sometimes they're left out not because they can't run it, it's because of the changes in Android itself that can cause them to be left out. Addtionally, yes, screw Qualcomm and Google for this short update policy. pfmiller Is the Nexus 4 running N less secure than the same phone running M? Or is it less secure than a newer phone running N? F4uzan Less secure than newer phone running N, though I suspect that it requires some security downgrade to make it boot on M as well. pfmiller So if it doesn't make the N4 more insecure than it already was, no reason not to upgrade it to N if there are workarounds that exist to make it work. David Eisenhour Nexus Six Last Google Phone now that I know this. Time to go to the darkside. Apple F4uzan Apple's side might actually be better if you're just using your phone normally (and yes, I'd consider switching if it's not for the price of iPhone that's hindering me) David Eisenhour I had a Nexus, Nexus 5, and Then a Nexus 6. Loved them all. Liked the clean OS and the upgrades to the newest OS as a feature. I do not like the Pixel. The screen is smaller and I love the form factor of my 6. Price was never an issue as I buy my phones outright. But 2 years of support is pitiful. 3 years id the life for most electronics and you can with care push 5. My daughters apple is a 5 S which was released on September 20, 2013. It is still on apples current Apple OS. I feel bad for the last folks who bought the Nexus 6 in December 2015 who will not even get two years of the current Android OS they were promised the most recent version of Android and Many of them are still under contract (SAD). It just a plain bad decision by google to say so what Mr. Customer. #notconsumerfriendly. F4uzan Yeah, the undervalued thing is the length of update Google (or in extension, Qualcomm) gives to the Pixel. I'd say that both parties are to be blamed, Google for having such a short update span and Qualcomm for being the same with their chipset. Let's hope whatever Google's cooking for their rumoured custom chipset has a better update life than Qualcomm's chipset. Dmitry Stepanushkin Agree except Nexus 9 not using Qualcomm SoC. Also NVidia provides longer support for its Shield. keithzg To be fair, Qualcomm is bad about drivers due to evil, NVIDIA seems to be bad about drivers due to a mixture of a lower-level of evil (binary blobs are inherently so) and just lack of direction. They seem to be constantly abandoning previous SoCs and throwing everything behind new ones hoping this time, this time it'll be a success . . . bekifft In this case that's not technically true. The Nexus 9 is using the same abandoned Denver core as their original, now not supported tablet. They were the only two devices to ever use this chip and it was rapidly abandoned after release due to performance problems. realtestman "performance problems" is the middle name of the Nexus Performance Problems 9. dep They all don't want to support old (not actually old) devices because they already sold these devices. bekifft It's circular though. Qualcomm claims OEMs don't update their phones for more than two years, so doesn't dedicate the resources to update their chipsets for longer than that, and as a result the OEMs CAN'T update for more than two years. It's a vicious cycle, and the only way to break it is to own the whole phone all the way down to the silicon, like a certain fruit company, and like Google clearly has in mind. Pindi Pirate So Google should start making their own SOC then. Well great. Alexander Agura Yep, Qualcomm supports its chipsets for about 2 years. But hell, Google is developing Android, why don't they make it more backwards compatible with a bit older hardware? Say, fluently support Nougat with Marshmallow BSP and libs. That's what CyanogenMod has been doing for years. Yes, older libs may not provide some new security features but with older Android version the device is even less secure. vzwuser76 They actually can and do run for longer than 2 years, just without updates. But just because they don't get updates doesn't mean they stop working. As KP said, it has more to do in most cases with Qualcomm offering updated drivers for their hardware. As I said, in most cases. Here I don't see why they needed to end update support. It isn't a full version update, only bug fixes mostly. And they were able to keep updating the 2013 Nexus 7 long after the 2 year window, but perhaps they did so because QC continued to support the S4 Pro. But regardless, my brother ran his original Droid Incredible for 4 years, long after updates stopped for it. He had no real issues with how it operates. But that was 2 years ago when he upgraded from it. Nowadays with security issues it may be less favorable to keep using it after security patches stop. However, security patches are supported for 3 years. kjohnson04 My first smartphone was Droid Incredible. The screen stopped responding in the corner, then I accidentally shattered the screen. Otherwise, I'd still be messing about with it. vzwuser76 I still have mine and it's still in pretty much mint condition. I turn it on from time to time to see how much faster the newer phones are. LondonLeedsFan But that stops us spending our money! Nicholas Conrad Time to XDA son! Darren Meier With all due respect, the N9 couldn't even run the latest software WHEN IT WAS RELEASED. What an absolute piece of trash, can't do anything right. John How do we stop supporting it when we only find out years later? Maybe Google can start a "years supported" certification program that manufacturers can use to market their phones. Brownsville#72 Agree 💯. I'm keeping my mine Nexus 6. Ian Mitchell I still haven't even gotten 7.1.1!! Carson Saldanha Flash the OTA Marty No. If Google refuses to send the OTA update, screw Google and go iPhone. Duder12 Why are u here? Marty That's an existential question I'm not able to answer...😉 Sruly J 42. Who cares about the question anyways? Marty Lol... Renaldi I. You'd leave Android over an OTA update? You're a peculiar troll. Marty Heh...I'm bored with Android anyways, so... Duder12 The truth comes out. See u in 2 years. Marty You never know. 😁 Marty Mine either. I'm going iPhone. JG Out of curiosity, what update are you currently stuck on? My 5X and 9 kept telling me they were both current, with the November update up until like 2 weeks ago (Jan 19th I think) when, a week or so after Google released the January update, I was finally given OTA access to the December patch (the phone found it itself & left a notification, I did a manual check on the tablet as the phone was updating & found it). After I rebooted into the December update I checked, and had instant access to the January update, and am currently current on 7.1.1. Maybe try rebooting the phone? Especially if it's a Pixel - maybe you just dismissed the update ready notification accidentally... Leonardo Baez I'm own a Nexus 9 and I'm ok with this. My N9 is working better than ever with superb battery life. So, if is EOL, I'm ok with it. Master Yates Really? I've never seen a Nexus 9 not get totally creamed by a Nexus 7 2013. Ron Harris Remember when you were the nerd, you know, the only one you knew with a Nexus 4? The only one of your friends not suckered into monthly payment plan because you got your phone for $350? Ah, the good old days. Nexus used to have a bit of dignity attached to it a bit of respect from fellow nerds, but then again, so did Google. Look how that worked out. When you back away from your companies motto "Don't be Evil" well...Stuff happens. Pour a little out boys for The Nexus. Kyle Lyles I gave my son a Nexus 1 for his birthday or Christmas. He's now an executive with a major autonomous vehicle company, running development. He went iPhone 7+ and never looked back at Android. Just put my wife on the same phone at Christmas. When my Nexus 6 dies, I'm moving to the iPhone platform after 6 years of a Palm Treo and eight years of Android, at least till now. Sruly J Eh. "Different strokes for different folks." Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, that's understandable. I've been on Android since the Nexus 4 days, and I've always loved it. Back in October, I bought an iPhone 7+, alongside my Pixel XL, to see what all the hype was about with iOS. And, to be honest, I don't really see myself getting another Android phone after this. The fact that my Pixel XL is only going to get Android updates for 2 years, even though it costs almost $1,000, just solidifies that decision. My name is…. What a shitty article. You should totally bash Google for not giving a 0.0.1 upgrade to their phone but you trying to make it sound like its normal to stop support halfway. Its a godamn joke Sruly J Isn't it interesting how two people can read the same article and get different impressions? My name is…. So, you read the article and u think they went hard (like they should have)? You can read some reviews of LeEco phones, or some older Oneplus articles, then tell me that this article is hard. Sruly J Oh, I don't think they went hard at all. I think they were just stating facts and weren't saying anything about stopping support halfway. Malechai i dont care about 7.1.2 on the nexus 6 as much as they'd better fix the damn speakerphone and not leave us hanging! Kyle Lyles Dude! Get Pure Nexus flashed in there and the problem won't ever exist. SMFH Marty Heh...7.0 is the end of the line for my Nexus 6. It's not receiving any updates at all. Duder12 You would get the OTA immediately if you just bothered to join the beta. Literally one button press. Slaghead I joined the beta after being frustrated at not getting the update and still haven't gotten off Marshmallow. Marty Heh...mine actually was on Beta, but never received any beta software. I unenrolled it and it still hasn't received any update. TriguyRN Same here. I installed the regular software update after unenrolling but never got 7.1.1. Marty Mine enrolled in Beta with 7.0 non-Beta and unenrolled with the exact same software. There hasn't been any OS update at all either on or off Beta. But I th9nk I'm understanding why the N6 isn't being updated to 7.1.1. I'm hearing that 7.1.1 is buggy. And since 7.1.2, which is supposed to fix those bugs, isn't coming to the N6, Google likely doesn't want to leave the N6 with buggy software. Marty Ironically, I booted my N6 up to get a screenshot of the current software and now the download is happening. Pffft...Google...meh https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3321cce6ec41853cac46037d412ee5cd89ee8c28a551669c949c46b0bb85689e.png Sruly J Congratulations, you found the secret method of updating Android devices ;) Marty Heh...no congrats. The 820+MB update just updated it to Jan. 5, 2017 security patch. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/42dc3c72183d99345844637904d20250340b222e9007840939ac7e3abde1b78b.png Shawn Kovalchick It always works when demonstrated to the technician. :) Marty Didn't actually work. Still 7.0. It just updated to Jan. 5, 2017 security. Kyle Lyles Can I ask why folks like you don't use Nexus Root Kit and flash a custom ROM like Pure Nexus in <10 minutes? Marty Well, in my case, it's the principal of the matter. Google refuses to send updates the easy way. It seems to me that whenever a new OS update is out, I have to wait too long to receive it. And in regard to my Nexus 6, I still haven't received it. It makes me feel like Google is screwing with me. tiger Does Android Pay work after flashing? Kyle Lyles Yes, there is plenty of info about how to enable it. Although, I have to laugh at those who are so dependent on Android Pay, they refuse to look any further than the crap OTA updates. Sorry, since I'm older than 40, I just don't get it. Shawn Kovalchick Why does the Pixel C not get the Pixel launcher? Corbin Davenport It's really only a Pixel in name. Renaldi I. It's a namesake from the Chromebook Pixels, not the 'new' Pixel brand. I do think Google should have brought that into the new Pixel family, but after all the developer hell they went through with it my guess is that they just want to bury it under the rug. It was even going to be a ChromOS tablet. Shame it didn't come out during Nougat or when Play Store found its way to ChromeOS. Shawn Kovalchick That's a shame. I really love mine. Sruly J Nexus Q!!! Brian Lippman And so ends their already terrible support for the Nexus 9 (yes, it consistently got updates, but it runs just as terribly as it did at launch. Chrome still runs better on a Nexus 10 than it ever did on a 9). JW Well this is disappointing. Being reasonable I could understand why it wouldn't get the Android O 8.0 upgrade with all the new features due to the old hardware. But N6 should get the 7.1.2 bug fixes, especially the bugs were introduced from the last update (7.1.1). It's like your plumber came to upgrade your pipes but left with a few leak and not fixing. Marty That's Google for you. I'm going iPhone. AmericanPatriot4 I swear Google is trying to destroy Android. This is utter crap. Jonathan Ive what can you expect from sundar pichai AmericanPatriot4 I guess not much :/ Matt Williams I certainly hope they resolve this speakerphone issue. Lawrence Good, what else could we expect from Google's customer service icyhotmike Now they know how us N5 owner's feel. Google killed off the most popular device ever sold just at the launch of Nougat. It's a combination of lies and marketing to drive prices up on new phones. Shelly-Man Vol 2 Good! My Nexus 9 can finally rest in peace. The worst tablet I've ever owned so far! Marty Same here. Shelly-Man Vol 2 I can't wait for a upgrade. Cakefish Got to hand credit to Apple where it's due. My iPad Air 2, first released in October 2014 is still receiving updates today. And will be getting iOS 11. Marty And they get updates just as soon as they're released. Knowledgeborn Allah You mean iOS users don't have to wait for staged rollouts? And if the updates still don't land, there's no need to unlock the bootloader and manually flash the update? Whaaaaaaaaat? 😳 /s Cakefish Yes, to every supported device, worldwide. None of the staged rollout nonsense from Android. I don't buy the 'server's can't handle the load' excuse as Apple prove it's possible to roll out updates internationally and even if the device isn't the latest and greatest. Marty I've never bought that "server load" excuse either. Mainly because Google's servers wouldn't be overloaded with the tiny market they serve with the Nexii and Pixels. Google doesn't have even a fraction of the market that the iPhone has. And note that Google's market is only Nexii and Pixels. The OEMs (Samsung, Sony, Motorola etc) handle their own update streams. Marshall Yeah pretty amazing. When you think about those tens of millions devices getting the same update the same day at the same moment (+ usually they also update Mac os the same day) , you understand Apple doesn't play the same game as others manufacturers. roberto.elena Google has explained on numerous occasions the reason for the staged roll-out, and it's NOT "because the servers can't handle the load". So, it's ok if you don't buy it, because that is BS made up by some ignorant people. Cakefish So it's to check for bugs I suppose? Really that's what these betas should be for but they still insist on prolonged stayed rollouts of final software. Apple show it's possible to rollout to everyone internationally at the same time without major issues. Sir_Brizz Except Apple has had updates that cause widespread issues and people end up dealing with them for weeks until a fix come out because there is also no way to downgrade. Marek Bujko weeks? Two days is max :D This is not Google bro :D Knowledgeborn Allah iPad Air 2? People are still getting iOS updates from Apple with the iPhone 5, released back in 2012! 👏🏾 Cakefish Yeah pretty amazing really. That's why the iPhone 5S is still being sold to this very day as new devices at retail whilst Android phones from 2013 are ancient history. The Air 2 is the same age as the Nexus 9 and yet still has many years of software support to enjoy. Dmitry Stepanushkin Trump still using Galaxy S3, which is "ancient history"? 😁 I mean those phones u think they old, but many people still using it, they running most of apps and services. And tablets like Nexus 10 have great screen even in 2017. Nicholas Conrad Also because the iphone hasn't really changed much since then. The screen resolution is a little higher now and the cpu is a little faster, oh and they added 1 gb of ram Roh_Mish I have a couple of friends that still use iP5. Still works good. Nicholas Conrad apple rolls out the reskin and number bump to old devices but actually drops features and critical patches after 2 years. apple just lies about keeping their devices up-to-date. Cakefish What can't an iPhone 5S do that the 7 can software-wise? Live photos and raise to wake, that's all I can think of. Roh_Mish Live photo is semi-hardware if it works as i think it works. The camera sensor just isnt fast enough for live photos Roh_Mish True. I still use the iPad 2 as a reader. Battery on it is still great and while it can't do intensive stuff now, still good if you need a large screen to open a webpage or for some illustration on paper, etc. I use it for twitter too and it still works. Not bad. Now that they have stopped updating it finally, i am thinking of upgrading to Air2/Pro 9.8 or whatever they announce next. TJStrat RIP you big, curvey, sexy mother! Vr Epicist I guess it's lineage os time ? Biff Wonsley Try Pure Nexus first. alfreduran Someone can tell me if Intel's processors can be supporting the updates for more long years? It's time Google begin to change that. Btw I'm owner of a Nexus 6 XT1103 32gb from Colombia and sorry for my english. Best wishes! 😉👍🏼 Pony Salvaje Las actualizaciones dependen del fabricante, lo que depende del procesador es la facilidad para liberar drivers y así dar mejor soporte a las custom ROMs, así que no, las actualizaciones dependen por lo general del fabricante y el chipset (solamente en caso de MediaTek.) alfreduran Hola! Gracias por responder en español, pero esa no es la respuesta que yo esperaba 😕 Saludos! TriguyRN Time to start flashing mine haha shaku Nexus 6 end on 7.1.1? 2014-2017.1 R.I.P. Ryan Sanders My girlfriend's Nexus 6 still hasn't updated past Marshmallow. Not sure if its because she purchased it from T-Mobile or not. But she'd be happy just to get 7.0. SE.Quence Custom ROMs FTW from now. Google update experience is becoming more dull and lazy. Community does more and better on aftermarket. Dmitry Stepanushkin Custom ROMs were good years ago. I remember my ZTE Blade I upgraded from 2.2 to 2.3.4 using Cyanogenmod. But these days some bad things happened. I still can't find a Nougat custom ROM, which has no major bugs like non-working camera or freezes when playing Youtube videos for my slightly older Nexus(!, but I thought they will be supported very soon after AOSP sources released) devices: Nexus 5, 7-2013, 10. Of course Docomo Galaxy S3 never good a single working custom ROM suitable for every day use. Miguel Angel One reason why I won't drop $600 for a phone. We really deserve more than 2 years of support.. Faheem Ahmed :( i hate when google does this... i wish nvidia should make android phones...as their support is much better and awesome Faheem Ahmed WHY THE HELL THEN WINDOWS 10 EVEN GET INSTALLED ON A 10 YEAR OLD PC :( AND GOOGLE CANT UPDATE THE STUFF FROM 2 YEARS ONLY :( Doby Gillis Stop being a whiny little bitch. Serge Cebrian Drivers JW Obvious I am not a Android geek but whoever the genius designed Android needs new drivers on every update should be fired. It's not like the same hardware will do magical new things. Ionut Lala How can they drop devices with minor version increments? 7.1.1 vs 7.1.2 What kind of crazy versioning scheme do they use? Valerio Pierbattista i just updated with the february security patch and noticed my android version rolled back to 7.0 ?! I believe i was on 7.1 before this morning's update. anyone knows what happened? the update was 860mb (which surprised me) Gabriele Molinarolo what phone? Valerio Pierbattista nexus 6. still on 7.0 to this day Arminator I still haven't got the update on my Nexus 6 as of today (January 31). What could be wrong here? TheByteSmasher @David I'm just wondering, If you know, why the beta update is rolling out but they're working on one for the 6p that'll come out "soon." Is the phone so different that it needed extra work? Or is it a subtle way to further dethrone the former King? tiger If Google is keeping it's promise of 18 months support...and they seem pretty determined to keep their promise! This means that the Pixel will truly only get 2 years support. In Fla That's why I switched to an iphone. Jonathan Ive tim cook is proud of u man :') Biga173rd #courage Biga173rd That was a unapologetically plastic move. Serge Cebrian thank you for still paying us a visit SHunter https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/88b01a7f013d6dc0cfc7dd247dc614a62307afd53e9f23aed2ab17de0e3ecf0f.gif PVL_93_RU Two worst Nexus devices to exist Master Yates As there are many positive Nexus 6 owners in the comments above, I'd argue that the 2 worst devices were the Nexus 7 2012 and the Nexus 9. Luxferro This is the #1 reason not to spend big bucks on anything with an ARM SoC in it. In order to churn out new and improved SoC's every 6-12 months, someone has to buy them. Being good with updates is counter-productive to sales. SunnyStroker End of January, just received the December security update for my 18 month old Nexus 6, (purchased new from Amazon). I've been reading since October 2016 that Google will push the new OS out to the N6. I don't really want another half baked Google OS but I would like the security updates in a timely manner. Sir_Brizz If this is true, then it absolutely is surprising and just another nugget of bad news for the Pixel. Up until this point, every Nexus device has received minor version updates on the Android release they are on until they hit the three year mark. If that's not true on the 6, that is very bad news indeed. This is just yet another of many areas where Google is very far behind the competition. The Pixel line isn't going to be worth it until Google makes a lot of progress on supporting their devices. Darren Meier I am totally fine with two years of updates, and then an additional year of security updates. I never keep a phone for more than two years, anyway. I'll be a little sad to see the extremely polarising N6 go to the great scrapheap in the sky, but the N9 can go die in a fire... except it can't do anything right, so it'd probably just lay down next to the fire and bootloop itself into eternity. Serge Cebrian LMFAO Cory Wilson I thought they were still supposed to be rolling out maintenance and security releases until the third anniversary? Thomas “Fat” Cat I have a N6 and I plan to have 7.1.2. Twitler We all gonna have 7.1.2 either if they like it or not :)) Eric B Reading a few comments here makes it sound like a good thing Google is considering non-Qualcomm chips for the 2017 Pixels. How exciting. sebastianer They have to stop with this and try to raise the Android upgrade support from 24 months to 48 months or something like that. I think this short term support (even if it's better than the other Android retailers) is bullshit kjohnson04 I'm a little sad my Nexus 6 won't get 7.1.2 (officially), but I'd kind of like to get 7.1.1. My NonVZW Nexus on Verizon hasn't seen a whiff of 7.1.1 since it was released. Brownsville#72 I will keep my Nexus 6 until it slows down dramatically or the screen falls off. #savemymoneyforretirement. Twitler Me too buddy.Why switch to a new phone ? just because of Android version? lol people forgot about the purpose of having a phone. Brownsville#72 Agree Clawz114 Motorola (or should I say Lenovo), if you are reading this, please make a Nexus 6 sucessor. Keep the exact same size/chassis, add a fingerprint sensor in the rear dimple, improve the cameras and internal hardware, give it type C USB, then call it the Motorola Shamu, as a nod to the current Nexus 6 codename. Job done. If you want to be extra fancy, give it a metal back and/or waterproofing too. Gray Bison Google's lack of loyalty to its customer base is appalling. When my Nexus 6, still running Marshmallow (because Google will not send out a 7.0 or 7.1.1 update via OTA), dies, it will be time to buy an iPhone. Being thrown under the bus by Google provides no incentive to buy a Pixel at all. TomCos My battery is tanking with bluetooth using up 99% of it, even when it's turned off. N6 running 7.1.1 Anyone else? :( Nerve Crap! I never buy google phone again (Pixel etc). I will buy one plus and use with lineage os. DBS93 That's not bad at all for a 2014 device. Note 4 which came out at the same time got stuck on 6.0.1 so nexus 6 users can't really complaint Follow Android Police 1.51M 464k 141k 103k Latest Deals 1 [Deal Alert] Get a 2016 Sony XBR X850D 55" 4K HDR Android TV for just $769 ($230 off) from Buydig on eBay 2017/04/02 9:22pm PDTApr 2, 2017 7 Luma 2-pack is $179 ($71 off) on The Home Depot for today only 2017/03/31 4:15pm PDTMar 31, 2017 25 [Deal Alert] Get a Plugable USB-C meter for just $17.95 ($17 off) on Amazon 2017/03/31 10:56am PDTMar 31, 2017 47 [Deal Alert] Get a black unlocked Galaxy S7 for $400 ($176 off) 2017/03/31 6:32am PDTMar 31, 2017 7 [Deal Alert] Get the Ecobee3 smart thermostat for $199 on Amazon ($50 off) 2017/03/30 12:49pm PDTMar 30, 2017 Latest Poll How often do you use virtual reality products (that you own)?

[Update: Official] Google Keyboard is now Gboard with v6.0 update—includes integrated search, dedicated number row, multiple active languages, and more [APK Download] Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2016/12/17 2:10am PDTDec 17, 2016 82 Plus 1 on G+ 242 Share on Facebook 83 Share on Twitter Total Shares407 Applications Google News Update 1: 2016/12/17 2:43am PST GBoard is now official. Google announced it on its Keyword blog, focusing on the new search and share options, multilingual support, and GIF insertion. Google released a keyboard app for the iPhone some months back called Gboard, and everyone was wondering if it would come to Android. Well, now it has as the v6.0 update to Google Keyboard. It's not only a name change, though. There are a few important new features, including a search shortcut and true multi-language support. The update is still rolling out, and Google has not yet posted an official changelog. Here's what we've spotted so far. G button (enabled in settings) offers quick access to search from the keyboard Pop-out toolbar (when G button not enabled) provides access to themes, settings, one-handed mode, and search Optional dedicated number row Up to three active languages with preference for one (previously had to switch) Gesture typing is now called Glide typing. Search for emoji Rearranged emoji panel with group selection at bottom Emoji have bright halo effect around them GIF button is always shown, but disabled in apps without support. We'll update if we spot anything else, but this should be most of it. Keep in mind, the G button is optional because you can still access integrated search from the toolbar pop-out. It's just one extra step. It's up to you if you prefer to just have the button. That's cool and all, but the dedicated number row will make a lot more people happy. You have to turn that on in settings as well. Those on the team who speak multiple languages seem quite excited about the multiple language support too. You can actually type in up to three of them without manually switching keyboard modes. This is similar to the way SwiftKey does it. The update is just starting to roll out, but we've got the new version on APK Mirror (Android 4.2 and higher). Note, it's in a different area of APK Mirror than the old Google Keyboard, but it is just an update. Update 1: 2016/12/17 2:43am PST GBoard is now official. Google announced it on its Keyword blog, focusing on the new search and share options, multilingual support, and GIF insertion.

Fan guy Rita will be happy for that number row :P Someone iOS got it first couple months ago if I remember correctly. Brad "Google released a keyboard app for the iPhone some months back called Gboard, and everyone was wondering if it would come to Android. Well, now it has as the v6.0 update to Google Keyboard. " AbbyZFresh iOS users barely even use Swiftkey. Let alone Gboard. K.P. Smith Good info. Ryan should include that in the very first sentence of this article that your commenting on ... Marko Šaric Great. Now I'm smearing egg on my phone screen cause I can't wait until I finish eating. Downloaded. Robert Trance You could have used voice control if ON?!! Marko Šaric It's not a big deal. It got wiped off. Robert Trance What phone if i might ask...? Marko Šaric Nexus 5x. jesuguru Knuckles (for screen)? Fork and knife (for eggs)? Marko Šaric Hand for dipping bread in egg yolk. Dominic81 "multiple active languages" FINALLY!!! WORPspeed THIS!!! SO much this! I was excited for gboard, but lack of this was holding me back, but reading that it is now included, I can say ADIOS SWIFTKEY! Or maybe it doesn't work as good :P Swiftkey isn't bad, just excited about gboard :D motoridersd Same! I love SwiftKey, but it can do some annoying things from time to time. I'm definitely going to be check out this new Gboard. WORPspeed And I already switched back to swiftkey. The delete swipe gesture on gboard is just horrible, it should just delete 1 word per swipe, not every either 1 letter or the whole sentence.....needs an undo button. The layout...well I'm just used to Swiftkey's layout and the way swiftkey is smart enough to isnert a space after a comma....small things that make gboard a horrible experience for me. I do keep it around incase I want to sent a gif/meme image, it's easier switching keyboards then apps :D motoridersd Yeah, the placement of the question and exclamation marks on Gboard is awful. Too many taps to get to them (they're probably hiding behind another key, but I didn't go hunting for them). Not getting a space after a comma, or getting a space after a word when putting in a question mark was annoying. The delete gesture is definitely not good on Gboard. Jordan Long press m or n is too many taps for question marks and exclamation points? Or press and slide on the period key? They're all very easy to get to. Also the slide-to-delete action is great. I don't know of any keyboard that does it in a significantly better way. motoridersd Turns out I had the symbol setting turned off, so I didn't see any of the characters on the letters or the period. The slide to delete on Swiftkey works very well because it works on the whole keyboard, not just on the backspace key. I've been spoiled by just swiping anywhere to delete a typo. You have to disable flow typing for this to work, but I don't miss that feature. Zorkos You don´t need an undo button. After you delete something the deleted text will appear as a suggestion Urs Müller It also doesn't seem to predict the next word. Instead it shows options for the currently swyped word... Also back to Swiftkey for now. Rapper_skull My dream came true. Rod Our* Rod What? Like in Swiftkey? rauldzmartin Exactly. Mario Porfírio Souza I hope that feature works well, because in swiftkey dont work well HARAMBE It doesn't even correct italian words with some french shit! GLORIOUS Vincent Bye bye SwiftKey samiazza Can somebody explain how does this work? Georgiy Alexandrov I guess it will predict words for both languages depend on what you type in, without need of switching languages manually. Apps By Usman basically what swype provided years ago :) (it's good to see google adapt it) bat0nas Exactly. Been using multiple language in Swype for years. HaltestelleLuitpolthafen I text in both German and English, but 75% of the time in English. I don't have to go into settings and manually switch it from English to Germany anymore, I can have it do it on the fly and set it to prefer English since that is what I predominantly speak. Felix /Offtopic When I interpret your username right you're from Mannheim? Why do you speak English predominantly? ;) mitchilin You don't have to go into settings. Just press the world icon on the keyboard and it changes language instantly. I've been doing this for years with German. snoop doge what do you exactly mean by it? Ashish Bogawat It is a good start, but Swiftkey has quite a headstart with support for many more languages. It (Swiftkey) even does English & Hindi, even though they use different scripts. I type in English and it suggests matching Hindi words along with the English suggestions. Ash Google has that as well, but that keyboard is Google Indic keyboard prediscover no asian language support though :( Ash Hindi, Tamil etc are Asian language. Fir Chinese there is seperate keyboard prediscover I thought Hindi had a separate keyboard too jenderalcilik I too excited for this. I installed right away after reading that sentences. I mean I always loved Swiftkey, but sometimes I hate it when it loads so slow when I switch from app to app. I hope this worked well. Eddy Nelson Lopez This is so épico ahora puedo change languages sin tener que touch the world icono 😂😂 Total Insecurity Hahaha^^ Robert Trance LOL, you so won this thread.... Avishek Jajajajaja Lord Argyris One upvote, duly earned. El_Big_CHRIS My main reason for sticking to SwiftKey, maybe I'll finally ditch it iiku it is also available for chrome spellchecking. Vratislav Jindra "multiple active languages" I HATE IT SO MUCH!!! I've never used it on other keyboards which had this feature. When I'm tapping, the keyboard usually guesses the language correctly. But when I start the text with swiping, it's more like 50:50 - sometimes it guesses the correct word, but very often it also offers me a word from a different language. I'd rather keep pressing the "switch language" button on my keyboard to switch languages manually instead of relying on a technology which fails half the time. bidou I don't like it either. It always writes the wrong word from the wrong language. You can disable it in the keyboard options and go back to the normal "press the switch language icon" type. Vratislav Jindra You're right, I must have missed that setting. Thank you very much! Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez It's happening!! Aleluya! I've been waiting eagerly for this feature since Google Keyboard supports Gif images. Sorry Swiftkey but now is time to move on. HopTzop Too bad it doesn't work well, at least here it's a pain in the arse. Also sometimes doesn't get the whole sliding and gives just a letter, sometimes it gives a totally different word that has nothing to do with what you slide, but happens to start with that letter. They just made me buy Swype which feels like it's reading my mind and runs buttery smooth. Bewear ARM64 only :c aSquard http://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/gboard/gboard-6-0-65-141378828-release/gboard-6-0-65-141378828-armeabi-v7a-android-apk-download/ Bewear Thanks. Brian ARM64 though :( Phoenix FUUUUDGE Andy Roid Whaaaa Adrianus AJ Nadeak There's an ARM version available. Michael Carr Can't say I'm a fan of the name change, but the new features sound cool. Downloading! Phoenix OMG is this really happening ? is this really happening ? FINALLY Carson Saldanha Ohh yeah... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4f2ee8ed9e24df5ba9a662d9616186472912325d74b164a358934193cba8e8ef.gif Phoenix I spoke too soon, it's still not happening for ARM owners lol just ARM64 Carson Saldanha Hopefully APKMirror will have the arm version soon. Artem Russakovskii Up now. Volodesi A number row? Finally. I can stop using SwiftKey. k0n And symbols hinting! I can have it set up almost exactly like SwiftKey now, but with added benefits and no extra app required :) FrozenHotChocolate Trying this right away!. But will still need a lot of improvements on the predictions front to pull me away from Swiftkey though. Michael Schaap Neat. Looks like it finally has most of the features I'm using Swiftkey for. (Number 1: multiple languages simultaneously – I tend to type in meerdere talen tegelijk; number 2: number row.) I guess I'll have to try it out and see if it beats Swiftkey yet. (Its prediction is still scarily accurate, though.) Rod It's been said here that it now supports multiple languages simultaneously. Michael Schaap Indeed. That's what I'm saying. Rod It's like a dream came true, until I saw the arm64 requisite.. Comediante "Optional dedicated number row" - It was about time! Only thing I miss is the hability to theme choosing colors (primary/accent) from a material color pallete and not just choose from a limited theme gallery. Jaime Andres Salame Borja Does it have Gif search? AdamH Yup, only works in Hangouts tho.. Artem Russakovskii Not only. In Messenger too. Badouken And Allo :P Abhilash Bingi Yup, but the app has to support it. Only Messenger and Hangouts do as of now. Rod No love for 32 bit. :( Baalinooo Not available for Nexus 6 then? :( Ten Bears not yet anyway... Rod Nope. CD RW ARM apk now available ntomka You don't have to wait for long. I got it through Google play update to my Honor 6 Plus, which is a 32bit phone. 😃 Rapper_skull Then upload the APK to APKMirror. EDIT: Never mind, it has already been uploaded. Rod Excellent news. Thanks! Carson Saldanha https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9835dd11c8683e36c4fcf70d1cd5c1ccbb48c6158a3019cd0c72fdcb6fce9949.gif Carson Saldanha https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4f2ee8ed9e24df5ba9a662d9616186472912325d74b164a358934193cba8e8ef.gif mx3 But no emoji prediction :( Caleb Lee ☹️ someone755 This guy does not use Gboard. cowboysfanzz Use Textra with Gboard it's heaven mx3 This has nothing to do with emoji prediction. cowboysfanzz Yes. Textra has emoji prediction XerBlade But it's a single SMS app, not something that magically adds stuff to the keyboard, so it doesn't help you in literally every other app on your device. wade_county I must be blind, where in the settings is emoji prediction in Textra? Corey Kinard If only Textra would use, or allow as an option, stock Android's quick reply in the notifications (where it sticks) and also added the stock inline reply option in heads up messages. It feels so cluncky to have their huge "quick reply" screen pop up now. I guess they could slim the app a bit by dropping the GIFs too since it's in Gboard. Marcus Clendenin You can search in the emoji keyboard. It's not as nice as the emoji prediction in Swiftkey but it does help when trying to find an emoji Cakefish Emoji search doesn't work for me. Just says "data for emoji search is not available". Weird. Checked permissions. Checked internet connectivity. Marcus Clendenin I saw a reddit comment that said the initial download needs to happen on WiFi? So maybe try doing that. I haven't been on WiFi today so I can't confirm whether that works Cakefish You sir, are a gentlemen and a scholar! Thanks! Jacques Ligier Can anyone confirm whether it works? Robert Trance I can predict for you... Marko Šaric Poll: What was your first search ever with gboard for android? AfrodanJ Pictures of Santa PHLAK What about gif support? Kyle Gospodnetich It's been there for months. Aaron I see it but it's crossed out here. Guess it only works on apps that support it. Artem Russakovskii Yeah, the button is now permanent, just disabled in app that don't support it, which is different than the previously confusing contextual GIF button. JSo You can now do a search with the keyboard which will pull up gifs in the results like it does by hitting the "gif" button. I tried it in Inbox but it inserts the link and not the gif itself. Anthony Castanza Its actually happening!! But what are we going to complain about now?! Oh wait, Allo. Nevermind. Michael Kennedy Fuckin' Allo... :( rauldzmartin Is it not killed by Google yet? Cesar Something something no sms fallback... Rapper_skull Multi-language is not exactly what I wanted. I now see IT - EN - ES, meaning that I will receive suggestions for Italian, English and Spanish. But what I really wanted was scrolling the spacebar to switch language, so that I can type Greek letters while writing. Unfortunately writing math will still be slow. Martin Can't you just tap the "change language" key? One tap, and there you have your Greek keyboard. Rapper_skull Nope, I also have other keyboards, so a lot of taps are needed. Martin I'm not talking about the "Change keyboard" button. I'm talking about the "change language" key next to the space key. You can enable it in the settings ("Show language switch key"), and it lets you cycle through your language with single taps. Rapper_skull Like the default Android button, it still cycles between keyboards. Martin That's strange. I have four different keyboards installed, and the language switch button only cycles through the different languages in Gboard for me. YouNex Long press number row for (some) Greek letters ! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ad08d55f06a775a882ce447cac20fc395dae92cb2d45714f508054225311896c.jpg Rapper_skull Doesn't work for me :( Tomáš Petrík Can you disable all of the top rows? No suggestions, no numbers, no G button, no themes shortcut... Just make it gone. I can do that in current version. If that option is gone, I will hesitate to update. I value screen estate. mattcoz Yes Tomáš Petrík Thanks! Igor Stanić How? mattcoz Oh, I see now that it still shows a bar with everything turned off in some apps. I tried it from the search bar and it wasn't there. Sorry about that. Tomáš Petrík Sadly, the answer is no. mattcoz Right, as I mentioned in my followup reply. Jaime Andres Salame Borja I wanted to search GIFs in Whatsapp? then i believe Whatsapp has to add the search engine... :( AbbyZFresh No gif support. Back to Swiftkey. Naxx ENVY It does support gifs... press the emoji button and its at the bottom,. the app has to support them too though senor_heisenberg Awesome. I'm so glad this was an update and not a separate app. Maxr1998 "Introducing Google Type, a smart keyboard with Google Assistant, tied to your phone number, and without SMS support." Vincent Don't give them ideas.. Clawz114 "The emoji panel was causing confusion with our users, so we have seperated this from the Gboard and Google Type to it's own dedicated emoji app, Gemoji." T4rd Hope they fix the the space bar cursor moving gesture, as it rarely works for my on my 6P. Sometimes if I try it for 20-30 secs it'll eventually remember I had that feature checked and start moving the cursor, so it's basically useless. Cory S Yeah, its a little stiff. I like the way it works on Chroma. Dehaha1 I agree, it's largely useless on my Nexus 5. It usually works on my second or third attempt, however at that point it would have been faster to just tap where I needed to go. On my iPad Mini 2 using GBoard it works much better, though sadly not as flexible as what is built into the default Apple keyboard. (Though I can't give up using GBoard, the gesture typing is too useful) mattcoz Are you holding and sliding or just doing a quick swipe? T4rd Tried it both ways several times. But I see now that if I do a quick swipe, it seems to work better, but still kinda inconsistent and awkward to use. Like your finger has to already be swiping before you touch the space bar, which doesn't feel right. So I think they need to tweak this gesture to allow you to do it while holding in on the space bar for a split second before swiping at least, esp since that doesn't have any other function associated with it (at least in my config). mattcoz No, you should NOT be doing a quick swipe. You hold it down and slide your finger, don't lift it until the cursor is where you want it. If that's not working, then there's something wrong. Martin I don't know if I'm just lucky, but I got it to work on the new Gboard on every single try so far. Previously it would always bring up the "Change Keyboard" menu instead, no matter how fast or slow I tried swiping. Simon I agree this function works much better with this new update. Berkay Did they add the two new keyboard themes that were on the pixel? Badouken Yes it has the blue color schemes for standard light and dark themes. Berkay I went ahead and got the APK because I was impatient, thank you anyway :) How do I use the GIF functionality? It doesn't seem to work anywhere. JSo Only works in apps that support it. Google Messenger, Hangouts and Allo. App developers apparently have to enable it themselves Badouken Mine didn't work at first but then randomly appeared after awhile. It appears when I clicked the smile icon at the bottom, it would then show a gif button next to it. Berkay Whenever I use the emoji search, it's so laggy... But google keyboard has been laggy for me since they introduced the update where they added all those new features like one handed mode. Tiuri Elvander I saw saw a video showing that the iOS version could send little screenshots of search results. I can't find a way to do that in this version of am I missing something?? Lazyboy0172 unfortunately doesn't look like we're missing anything. whenever I search for something it shows a "share" button but just inserts the text from the result as well as http link for the search. It's not the worst, but I'd much prefer to insert it as an image, especially in apps that support the official api for image insertion from keyboard. I mean it's already there with gif search, so why not make those shared search results as pretty in my text message as they are on the keyboard? Still very happy to be able to search from keyboard though, and be able to search emoji. Goodbye, Dango. Goodbye, Swiftkey. Please keep improving, GBoard. Paul_Werner I wasn't using Swiftkey but I was just like you regarding Dango. Glad to have it a part of the built in keyboard now saf1927 The multi language support works really well with two languages. Haven't added a third yet, but now Swift Key is really obsolete for me. Christopher Robert Does it allow for keyboard size scaling? How about better prediction? Themes? yep still not a good replacement for Swiftkeye. Tuck Choate Yes, yes, and yes. They're in the settings. Good thing Swiftkeye has good autocorrect. It'd be embarrassing to make a typo that contradicts your point online. Miku is Best Vocaloid "Multiple active languages". That look a long ass time to happen. br_hermon I want to like Gboard but it's lack of secondary key functions keeps me using SwiftKey. Abhilash Bingi What do you mean by "secondary key functions"? If you mean typing symbols by long pressing alphabets, you can do it in Google Keyboard. br_hermon Thanks the heads up! I never knew that. It's disabled by default. I had to go into settings to enable it. epsiblivion not a fan of all this rebranding to G products. must be new internal management on the apps. Ben G products... like what? Except this one? Perry Mason Gmail /s Todd I really hate that they did it to their email app. I don't think I'll ever get used to it. bikrame Hey guys, how do i add that numerical line above on keyboard. JSo Settings>Preferences>Toggle Number Row bikrame There is nothing like that JSo Then maybe it didn't update for you. bikrame I just downloaded. Vorastra https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a256e9e1393428c03b73ef88560b8959247cf4df2fb8b4664a215b5763527b9a.png bikrame https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cb2c9e011ee1cbea13883ec8e56c4afa707debc7c253dac399b7fa0841d64ae7.png Vorastra Super weird. You're missing the whole "Keys" section. bikrame May be its because i don't have stock Android ??!! Georgiy Alexandrov You downloaded it from Play Store? Then I suggest you check version number, it should be 6.0.65 bikrame ok now its going to sound super weird. I did download from play store and it says like this https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/599303b5bf88aff23f000101544e9f9f626e9d31d3a791cf557f08a8bef2ddb1.png Georgiy Alexandrov It's not really that weird, update probably not rolled out to you yet. You will get it a little bit later (or just download apk from link in article). And you should actually check app version through settings>apps>gboard (if you not seeing Gboard in apps try to look for Google Keyboard) https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/25eff26cc1692310ac42f8878e975697259b70c46702b63ed7fd373a8d67597b.png Kieron Quinn It's on staged rollout and hasn't reached you yet, use the APK Vorastra I'm not using stock android. Using an LG G4. Georgiy Alexandrov Settings > preferences > number row Alex Guitar This is mucho bueno for my Spanglish! Frisi *muy :P Frisi Bye Swiftkey. It's me or Swiftkey caused more "typos" than any other keyboard? Of course, Swiftkey would correct them, but I type better using Google's Keyboard. Now with multi-lingo support I'm more than happy. motoridersd I've been using SwiftKey for a long, long time since I have always needed two languages. I have not been using Flow since I live by the swipe to delete gesture. I love the SwiftKey prediction of emoji, I use it ALL the time, and I am very used to the layout of the keyboard. Trying Gboard for the first time, it feels odd, but it's easy to type in. It doesn't seem to always introduce the period after hitting space bar twice. Swiping the backspace key to delete a word is cumbersome because the surface is very small, so I'm missing that already. There is no emoji prediction, but the search is nice. Unfortunately it doesn't know the latest emoji like bacon, avocado or facepalm, but once they are in the recent window, this can be less of an issue. The prediction does not work in the search box, which is a shame, because searching Google without it is a PITA. Hurricane Andrew The prediction also does not work in Chrome or the Facebook search field. Big oversight. motoridersd Yeah, I use that a lot with SwiftKey. A new Gboard update just came through, wonder if they're tweaking these things. Christian yup and for this thing i still use swiftkey, is really helpfull the prediction in chrome ;) Freek Smulders This is pretty big! #NotMyPresident Why would you want an advertising company logging all your keystrokes? PVL_93_RU I'd rather trust them than my own government to do the same #NotMyPresident LOL. Okay..... /rolleyes 7-down It's in the settings. You can disable sharing of what you type. #NotMyPresident And if you believe that Google respects that, I've got a bridge to sell you. 7-down Hopefully it's the Golden Gate Bridge. I really like the way it looks. http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/ec/ec23811e3ebf097d66addd31391d2b84d094eb85cc37a9b74dec3475a722ca0c.jpg XerBlade Gboard settings > Advanced > Disable "Share snippets" (if it really bothers you that much) P.S. It never actually logs all your keystrokes, even with that enabled. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I see how that could be a concern. They should've filtered the keyboard the way it is in iOS, since that would probably give a lot of people more peace of mind. For example, on iOS, you can't enter your password using Gboard for this exact reason. Whenever you have to enter a password or pin number, it automatically reverts back to the default keyboard (which doesn't store information) to prevent anything getting leaked. But, all in all, this version is pretty cool too. XerBlade ...Seriously, this isn't sending your passwords back to Google. Apple did things that way in iOS to prevent possible malicious third party keyboard replacements from taking advantage of that (which IS a concern in Android: seriously, you probably shouldn't go around installing random keyboards from people you've never heard of). This keyboard, being not-a-malicious-app and all, simply never includes anything marked as a password field in the "snippets" it sometimes [optionally] collects as statistical data for use in improving the app. Knowledgeborn Allah At least that's what they tell you... I'm not trying to sound like a conspiracy theorist or anything, but we don't really know what's happening behind the scenes. Google is an advertising company, and their job is to know as much about you as possible. Statistical data is one thing, but personal information is something different. Another thing that separates the Android version from the iOS version is that the Android version is tied to your Google account, while the one on iOS functions independently. That's how, on Android, they can share "learned words" across your Android devices. They can filter these through your devices because, since they're tied into your Google account, what you type (or at least some of it) goes through Google's servers. It's not anonymous data to just improve the app. It's data specifically about you, tied to your personal account. PVL_93_RU So when the G button is active - how do you switch languages? Do you just tap the same key? Is there a gesture like swipe the spacebar (swiftkey)? Frisi You don't have to now since it will automatically "change" as you type. PVL_93_RU I don't like that XerBlade The G button is unrelated. By default, it has multiple languages active simultaneously (so you just type and it intelligently figures out which language you're using as it goes). Or you can manually switch languages by long pressing spacebar (was already a thing in Google Keyboard). OR you can enable the dedicated language switch button in the settings (was also already a thing in Google Keyboard), which adds a button for manually switching to the left of the space bar (note the optional G button is on the left side of the suggestions pane, so again, completely unrelated). PVL_93_RU >OR you can enable the language switch button in the settings (was already a thing in Google Keyboard), which adds a button for manually switching to the left of the space bar Phew, thank god Kwetsima Maluleke Number row? Finally! Nuno G. Gboard?! What were these guys drinking?!? raazman The good stuff. tim242 Nothing good about this POS. raazman You're entitled to your own opinion. To me, the best keyboard out there just got better. tim242 Yeah, because a blank bar taking up screen real estate is so much better. I'm glad you like it. raazman What blank bar? tim242 The settings bar, above the keyboard. raazman https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2569deb1397c93e3c918c8e97290dbd8c70fafb66fa9d5277b20236aa34124a6.png Huh? What exactly are you talking about? tim242 That bar where you have suggestions. I don't use suggestions. If you disable suggestions, the bar remains as a blank bar. They do this on about every other version. raazman Ah ok, makes sense. I use the suggestions so I never had the need to remove it. Aaron Sounds like a personal problem. tim242 You sound like a blocked problem : ) Aaron Doesn't matter. You can't stop anyone from replying. Wis Ciao Swiftkey, this is soooo good - everything I wanted. Thx, Google... David Prieto What's with the emoji search? Why doesn't it return any results? JSo Emoji search is working for me. ADofCLE The number row is probably the only new feature I am going to use lol mattcoz Dedicated number row? Dedicated number row?! DEDICATED NUMBER ROW!!! Andy Roid Yes, that's what it says in the article mattcoz It sure does! Adrianus AJ Nadeak #DEDICATEDNUMBERROW yka1988 OMG finally! I just switched back to SwiftKey after months and months of using the super snappy Google Keyboard. Those were exactly the things I was missing, and especially the language features made me switch back recently. well, byebye Swiftkey, welcome back Gboard :) El Jefe this is great so now I can do GIF kb in Hangouts but only lif not via SMS. In the Google Messenger app, I can do GIF kb with SMS... I'm running latest everything 7.1.1 ahhh Jordan L I'm not seeing the G button on my Pixel XL. anyone else? I enabled it in settings. rebooting now. I also don't see any text predictions. the whole top bar is missing. EDIT: reboot fixed. XerBlade Make sure you're in an app that supports text predictions. It won't show up if you are typing in the Google search bar, for example. Bewear Emoji search not working for me. It might be because my device is set in Spanish. Scros97 A mi sí que me funciona en castellano la búsqueda de emoji! Bewear Not for me :/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a56c197ba6b723f6ccc0ba473c4dc94277e9cac70a07f5146133052155fdc1f8.jpg Kieron Quinn I have the same issue, apparently you have to be on WiFi at least once for it to download. Shame I won't be until tomorrow. keithzg See this is when it pays to have two devices, so you set one to be a wifi hotspot, then trade off ;) Kieron Quinn My Nexus 5X IS a hotspot, because my flat wifi is broken Ashwin I've installed the app on wifi, have been on wifi the entire day and also tried the same with the new update and still the same error persists for me. What do I do? Cakefish Same but my language is English :( alessiolarva No way to search images directly from the keyboard? tim242 Great. From 41, to 72 MB running service, and laggy again uggggh Aaron Really? Not seeing any lag here. Maybe it's your phone? Would be the first time a Galaxy experienced lag... tim242 Yeah, because a Galaxy chooses which versions of Google Keyboard to lag on. *Eye roll JSo No lag here either. It's not the update. Rod Actually it's showing up as 100mb ish for me. Alex Feels like they finally fixed the Google keyboard lag. That is my only gripe with my Pixel XL ahtough that problem was also on the 6p). Cakefish "Data for emoji search is not available." What does that mean? Samson Don't know. It works for me. Cakefish What phone do you have and which Android version? I have Nougat 7.0. Samson Much appreciated update. I like it a lot! Rod This is the official Google keyboard. Samson It is now. And the problem still exists. So I had to go back to the older version of the official Google keyboard. Very disappointing. Dustin Mingo Swipe from backspace is gone :( Georgiy Alexandrov It still there, or did you mean something else? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/09a329c7a63ed9bb2bcdeec4f5376ebdb3d98d40b75e3f7e2788bf488a681485.png Dustin Mingo Setting's gone for me. I'll clear data and report back Georgiy Alexandrov That's good to hear JSo No it's not Rod It isn't. Steve Will they ever enable its auto-corrections/auto-suggestions when searching? Rocket Does anyone know what happened to picture background? JSo You mean in themes? It's still there Rocket On the old Google Keyboard you could select a picture as the theme, but it looks like its gone now. JSo It's still there for me. I don't know why it's not working for you Rocket Did you do it as an update or as a new installation?? JSo I installed the apk right over my existing app Rocket Im gonna reinstall Google Keyboard (and brave the clunky LG Keyboard) and then update to GBoard Rocket Got it working by selecting a theme and then updating. Now it's an option. Georgiy Alexandrov Working for me on 7.1 and 6.0 but not on 4.4. Well, that's weird Rocket I'm on 5.1 so maybe that has something to do with it? Corey Kinard You sure? I press the arrow on the top left of the Keyboard, press the pallet, and the first theme option for me in Gboard is the "My images" one Edit: way too late! Igor Stanić how to disable popup toolbar when g is not enabled???...it just takes up space...everything is fantastic except this freshprince_87 SwiftKey is still better Igor Stanić How to disable suggestion row ...i dont use it so it is blank...terrible Georgiy Alexandrov You can't, as far as i know tim242 Yep, they always fuck something up. I had to revert back. Igor Stanić Me too Archenuh How to you revert back this damn cancer of an app? Dave Okay, wow. This app somehow fucked up my Pixel XL. I've installed it and it always freezed and didn't let me close the keyboard anymore. So I force restarted where it got stuck. I've hold down the power button again to force restart and when it booted up I was set back to Android 7.1 (had 7.1.1) and I can't access recent apps, can get into the quick settings, have different system settings (for example it vibrates when pressing home although I had it disabled) and it doesn't get data connection. What is this? JSo I really don't think a little keyboard app could cause all that. The most that could probably happen is that the keyboard may keep force closing if you installed the wrong version but I don't think it would do all the things you said happened. Dave I don't know either. But that's how it went. Everything was working fine and after I've installed the keyboard and it kept freezing and therefore covering up half my display although I was on the homescreen I force restarted where it got stuck. One again force starting brought me to that situation I am in now. Zach Mauch LOVE LOVE LOVE the dedicated number row. I would also like the option to add a "tab" button to the keyboard. suavemezie No emoji predictions? JSo What are these emoji predictions everyone is bringing up? Georgiy Alexandrov A SwiftKey (or other keyboard) feature, something like this https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/045c7a98611e38f08413474280cb41eb8fd78121f38eae7386543f5cc4490eb2.png JSo Was this something that was shown by Google or that the GBoard on iOS has? Just seems everyone is bringing this up all of a sudden. Georgiy Alexandrov Idk, but I dont remember Gboard having this on iOS. I guess it just a popular feature that many custom keyboards have. DubeBoom While Gboard feels much faster and more fluid, there are some things I just like about Swiftkey like the easy access to ? and !. But I'll try using Gboard for a few days to see if I get used to it. JSo Turn on "Long Press For Symbols" for easy access to those. Ashish Bogawat I have that option, but with Swiftkey you don't even need to long-press. Just swipe left on the '.' key. Seems small, but is super efficient once you get used to it. mattcoz Another quick method is to swipe from the symbol key, see if that works for you. Adrianus AJ Nadeak It's not as easy on a wide phone like the Nexus 6. mattcoz True Rod Decrease the long press delay, set it to 120ms. It'll make your life easier. Arshdeep Singh Saini It doesn't install 😢 Nathan J Aww. Google Keyboard's growing up. It was always my favorite keyboard on Android, even though it lacked some features of other keyboards. It was accurate which is what I liked. "Gboard" is a downgrade. On iOS, the Gboard autocorrect is just off the wall. Microsoft's Flow Keyboard (did y'all get that yet?) is better for trace typing, but it will not learn new words. No curse words, no proper names... gotta tap that out. So I deal with Gboard since it will learn... but not from its mistakes. It might be a limitation of iOS, but Gboard on iOS is vastly inferior to Google Keyboard on Android. Coming from someone who has used both extensively. Craig Nelson I have both myself and you're right the auto correct on Gboard IOS is not as good as IOS native keyboard but I will say that the Gboard on IOS seems slightly better than the one on android when it comes to the fluidity of finding a search result and using it. Max Not a second-copy-of-the-same-app? S**t what's happened Google? mrjayviper finally catch up to iOS. Thanks google. I'll be enjoying this on my note4 as I've been doing on the Air2 and 6s+ itsatrap Its good but still no better than Swiftkey. Not even close. jl2222 ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You can perform google search in Swiftkey? Find a gif without leaving the keyboard? itsatrap Those things are extras, keyboards are for typing. Swiftkey is still far better at it. On top of that, there is this annoying bug: https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=176390 Rod I agree. Swiftkey still has the lead. Azzy Fuck, only 3 languages at a time! Luckily SwiftKey can accommodate 5, just the number I need! Rod You speak 5 languages? Not bad! steb0ne Finally NERV I am still waiting for it to include those Asian languages so I don't need to download a worse separated one. xunknownx finally! been waiting for the google keyboard to have a dedicated number row. Albin Does it record keystrokes? Rod Of course. Machine learning is a thing. Umer Farooq It now also supports Urdu swiping and suggestions. Vincent Goh Asian languages? I need English, German, and Chinese. I don't need multi languages to include Chinese, but I don't want to switch keyboard app whenever I need to type Chinese. pfmiller Might be more realistic for them to add better English and other Latin alphabet language support to the Pinyin keyboard. I can understand them not wanting to clutter up their main keyboard with various input methods. Ramiro Fernandez I noticed something, don't know if it's new to this version but pretty sure it is. The keyboard will sometimes now correct *back* one word if the next word you type changes what it would predict. So I typed "I'm feeling" but when I typed "I'm" it detected it as "on". Then after typing "feeling" it changed the "on" to "I'm". Gave me options for the two word suggestion too (see screenshot). Doesn't always happen, I guess it depends on how close I was with my gliding and how confident it was with the original prediction. I've never seen this before, but it's really clever. I wish it would take context into account better when suggesting words in general. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f788aeb53d108efe429fbde31f0cead3ef3ecba862432200ee25bd8e1eecf969.png Rod Yeah, I noticed it yersterday whilst replying to a Reddit comment. itsatrap Do you guys have this problem: https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/websearch/sxhRXvLfILk WesleySmalls Have they learned nothing from the IE6 toolbars? benjammin03 I am waiting for the google keyboard to have the swipe left to delete the last word. After using it on Swiftkey, it's impossible to use a keyboard without it. Portgas D. Ace Gboard does have this option. benjammin03 I think I tried this before, but I couldn't get used to having to start at the delete key. I'm used to being able to swipe left from anywhere. I forgot about it though, so I'm going to give it another shot since this is the only reason I still use Swiftkey. Thanks! Portgas D. Ace I used Swiftkey in the past but never gestures. So I had no idea it works differently there. Rod In Gboard, you'll need to swipe from the backspace key. But, it's more effective, as you can delete a 10,000 word text all at once. Portgas D. Ace https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/751b4dcb558130893fe4db757a19aa363e250b3b3f2f347889f55783a469ef98.png Rod Swipe horizontally from the backspace key, and you can even delete the whole text at once. Faheem Ahmed not available in 4.2+ Promethean Add Swypes select all/copy/cut/paste gestures and I'm sold, I use them a lot more than I thought and missed them from other keyboards. Jack Sparrow I find it very buggy. It shows only one result. No horizontal scrolling like on iOS. And the funny thing is, if you search for "gboard", it returns the result for slash keyboard! Is it just me or is everyone facing the issue? Rod What do you mean, horizontal scrolling? Savage Alien "Emoji have bright halo effect around them" Yeah, whose bright idea was this? It doesn't look very pretty. QeeYou i know right 😂, looks very bad in bright themes'. neonix One more new feature I noticed: you can now edit the current theme. I believe previously, you couldn't make changes once the image was set. Dobriy Her Still not available in Turkish play store keithzg Oddly enough, the Play Store is still reporting this to me as Google Keyboard, but showing the version to be 6.mumble, while if I go into Settings -> Languages & Input -> Virtual Keyboards I see Gboard. Portgas D. Ace I get it listed as Gboard the Google keyboard in the updates list and as Google keyboard in the play store listing. dylan-m So, anyone else finding the emoji keyboard uniquely irritating now? They're wasting a ridiculous amount of vertical space, they have *two rows* of tabs, and the bottom row of tabs appears where the space bar is (while the emoji key is right beside the comma key). I frequently end up looking at the plain text smileys keyboard because I happen to miss the comma key while I'm typing. (They probably shifted the keys over by a few pixels again). That would have been fine with the old keyboard because the key to go back was in the exact same place. Now you have to pause and look for it because *the entire layout suddenly changes*. Also, they only have three tiny squashed little rows for the actual emoji, which is as many rows as they have for chrome. It's completely terrible. It would not be hard to flip that first row of tabs to the top, squeeze the search button beside them (because it doesn't need to be a text box and they can probably kill a category or two), and maintain a consistent layout for the bottom row of keys. Anyway, this is the second time in six months they have made significant changes to the keyboard layout, unexpectedly screwing with peoples' muscle memory. I guess I shouldn't be surprised by Google any more, but, it's pretty bad form. Ashwin "Data for emoji search is not available" error when tryed to search emoji...Anyone else with the same error?? Even updated to 6.0.68 (first update after Gboard 6.0.65)...Still no luck...Guys, someone please help!! please Does anyone know how the f I can disable the stupid toolbar? I HATE it, it just takes up space and I'll never use it. Any drastic measure to get rid of it works for me. Archenuh I really need this as well. What the fuck is wrong with them adding that fucking stupid toolbar above the keyboard and not letting us DISABLE it?! please how to disable toolbar LOL How does active languages work? I don't get it Rod You can start writing a sentence in english and throw german words in the middle, and it will auto correct all of them according to their idioms... LOL So it only works with Latin alphabet? Rod No, those were examples. The app description on Play Store says it covers over 120 languages. LOL But I cant just write a sentence in English and then throw a word from a different language. To write anything in different language I MUST switch keyboard to that language in order to use that alphabet Rod I have English and Brazilian portuguese set, and I can start a sentence in portuguese, throw in some english words and finish in portuguese, and it will auto-correct all the words automatically. I don't need to tinker with anything at all. Just like in Swiftkey. LOL That's because Brazilian uses Latin alphabet. Its impossible to type a word in a different language if it's not Latin Rod Oh, I never tried another language that doesn't use latim alphabet. My bad. Scorpiax7 How does the "multiple active languages" thing works? i need an explanation, please -.- <3 Dmytro Gulivatyy If you have multiple similar languages installed you can type in both without switching and it will understand which one you meant. It should display the languages that are used on the spacebar key below. Rod You can start writing a sentence in english and throw german words in the middle, and it will auto correct all of them according to their idioms. Dmytro Gulivatyy Does anyone know why we're getting it so late? I remember people protecting Google not releasing it on Android because we had G Now on tap but I'm confused now. Mako g now on tap is somewhat hidden in Pixels, so this is a good alternative Dmytro Gulivatyy I know and I agree, but why hold out for months before finally releasing it here kinda saying "Hey, you guys can have it too, don't worry we haven't forgotten." Just feels like it. Mako yeah, I really don't know why it took so long Dmytro Gulivatyy Less resources? Harder to code for? I mean it's their OS. Maybe they didn't care enough because it's easier to search for something with the search bar always accessible, GNow on tap here, and they weren't in such a hurry. But now they come out saying this is a better way. Sometimes i cant understand their behavior. pfmiller Android already has plenty of easy ways to access Google search, so it probably wasn't a big priority. Mwikarago Christian Why doesn't auto suggestion work in chrome search bar? Any idea? Dmytro Gulivatyy It's always been like that. I don't know for sure if i'm right but i think it's because they don't want to mess up your query because it's a browser address field. Same goes for the Google search bar. They think you will want full control over what you're typing because it can get technical, unlike the usual chats you have with people in chat apps. It sometimes offers predictions itself but not always. One of the reasons i'm still with SwiftKey. Mwikarago Christian That's a weird decision on their part. The only time I need autocorrection is in the address /search bar as I usually search using recurring words. That's also the reason I'll stick with SwiftKey Dmytro Gulivatyy Yes, it's been discussed times and times again and even listed as a bug https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=176390 but i personally don't think it's one, they would've fixed it a long time ago. For what its worth i don't understand their reasoning either, you can still type and have it write what you meant and not autocorrect it but i also have other reasons to stick with SwiftKey(one being its better at autocorrecting something when GBoard thinks it was just gibberish and has no clue) but it's getting better and has its charm too. marclee Yes it has been always like this.. I kind of understand why Google wants autocorrect disabled in chrome address bar (not agree tho), I just can't understand it is disabled in Google search bar and YouTube..... Rod That's disabled in the app. Someone on Reddit revealed the code. Pedro Diego Fernández It seems I'm the only one having problems with the keyboard...sometimes I glide I can see it's writing the word I want but when I finish it just adds a letter... and the multiple active languages is too funky to use... had to switch back to aosp :( Navin Govindani Not a big fan of the initial release as it has many problems with Spanish, doesn't suggest anything with "ñ", hell it even tries to autocorrect anything I type with it, not to mention, the occasional lag, I understand it's an initial release but please get your shit together team! MikeOxlong The versions available on apkmirror are old (6.0.65). I currently have 6.0.69 on my 6p and pixel XL direct from the play store... Rod Contact Artem, maybe you can share your apk with them? SyCoREAPER Why does the Google Keyboard fdiffer from the AOSP one? Rod AOSP version is outdated and missing the newer features. It's a bare-bones version. SyCoREAPER Aosp in my opinion is functionally superior with the long press symbols for every key Rod That's also present in Gboard. SyCoREAPER Thanks that's interesting and must be new. Wasmt there a few months ago when I last tried it. pfmiller That's an option in Gboard SyCoREAPER Thanks that's interesting and must be new. Wasmt there a few months ago when I last tried it s427 I think I'll make the switch from Swype to Gboard for good now. The only thing still missing IMO are the gesture shortcuts (copy, cut, paste, select all, change capitalization), which are super useful in Swype. So, GOOGLE IF YOU'RE LISTENING YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO! dk mke That and the exclamation and question mark short cuts as well. By far the best features of any keyboard IMO. It's why I keep going back. Rod As a long-time Swiftkey user, I deeply miss the punctuation auto-spacing. drcaveman Anyone else having the GBoard just randomly stop accepting input? I fix it by hiding and clicking the text input box again. Seems to happen more frequently in messaging apps. freshprince_87 SwiftKey is still way better than this new Google keyboard. First of all, SwiftKey is better with word predictions. Secondly, SwiftKey has emoji predictions and Google keyboard does not. And lastly, the SwiftKey emoji list of emojis scrolls down📜 very smooth and fast. But instead in the Google Keyboard that same emoji list scrolls through multiple horizontal pages instead. It's very slow and takes forever if you are texting. Mace Moneta Still no control, alt or tab key (even just the option in advanced setting would be nice), which is annoying for those of us that ssh into systems. marrecar Ok I updated the app this morning and it completely broke it. No words show up on prediction bar, double space doesn't add a dot, can't delete by swiping to the left, can't move the cursor by swiping the spacebar. Plus the emoji menu looks awful. Does anyone have the same problem? I tried deleting data first, didn't work, then I replaced it with stock version, updated and still the same. obk88 very intrigued by gboard used it for 5 days went back to swiftkey...typing is just more effortless on swfitkey. Prediction is better on swiftkey, no suggestions in chrome or other apps is really annoying, gliding isnt as smooth and better emoji experience on swiftkey...google is going in the right direction but this app still needs work...for now im back on swfitkey but keeping an eye on gboard for sure Christian Wagner Jr Still too large of a keyboard. I have a Nexus 6P and with it on its smallest setting, the keyboard and the box above it take up just under half my screen! SE.Quence so what? just resize it in settings Christian Wagner Jr I did. Its set to the smallest setting. Went thru all the settings as well. If they only gave the option to make it smaller by one or 2 more sizes, I would dump swiftkey for this no problem. Not all of us have donut fingers and need keys THAT large SE.Quence Yep, I can agree that some of other keyboards can be smaller when set to smallest size. But setting GKB to lowest height is pretty decent IMO. Abhipsa Banerjee On Clicking the search emoji area it shows "data for emoji search is not available".. now i don't understand why. Can u help me with this? Anon Imus You may need to be connected to wi-fi the first time you want to use this feature Abhipsa Banerjee On Clicking the search emoji area it shows "data for emoji search is not available".. now i don't understand why. Anon Imus You may need to be connected to wi-fi the first time you want to use this feature sachouba It only took Google 3 years to add some features available on Samsung's keyboard and SwiftKey. And Google fans sound astonished... patrick yes i had the numbers row on my S4 stock samsung keyboard. but as far as autocorrection, i always found Google keyboard to be more accurate. SE.Quence Testing new GBoard on my 2 Nexus devices. Both running 7.1.1. Dictionary sync doesnt work even when account is set and sync was forced manually. By some reason, GBoard is not presented in Google sync settings (Accounts - Google) but IDK whether it should be here. Who else is facing this? Đức Thành I've been using the APK since a few days ago and autocorrection is still as horrible as ever, especially for Vietnamese. There's no options to set the aggressiveness level of autocorrection, and it's a pain in the neck to hit backspace multiple times for every sentence I type just to go back and fix the incorrectly autocorrected words. Not to mention Gboard now tries to autocorrects whole compound words and phrases, and every time I want to say: "Yo Google keyboard, I appreciate the effort but honestly you are not doing that well since you don't know the language or how I type that well, and your ultra aggressiveness in helping me is creating more trouble than it solves, so could you stop?" In the end just now I had to turn off autocorrection altogether, and now I have to face the problem of not having autocorrection for either language. I wish there were some middle grounds, but Google is too stubbornly extreme in its ways sometimes. Sigh. dhamp2g Vietnamese? ?? Honestly dude, English only ..... LMAO it corrects English well 😂😂 Đức Thành I'm afraid I don't fully comprehend what you mean. Yes it autocorrects English very well, but it has also started supporting autocorrection for Vietnamese since Google Keyboard 5.0, and that's my native language so there's nothing wrong with using that, and since the app itself officially supports the language... Arrgh forget it, you won't get it anyway. dhamp2g I understand , I was just saying all us english speaking folk only car about english problems LMAO :) mizrulez I'm not sure if it's just me, but I can't turn off the keypress pop-up in the latest update. I tried deleting data, but the option is still not there. I find the popups extremely annoying. 😏 ggggg Something extraordinary happened. Google updated Google Keyboard instead of creating another keyboard App. mwolverine i wish it would show suggestions when searching in google apps. I usually end up going back to swype because of this. Usman Nagi Only reason I am not upgrading is that I miss the no key delay feature. Is there any way to enable in this current build? It slows my typing down and I only type better with popups. Itchy_Robot Why don't they just put Google Assistant into this keyboard? Renan At least that hideous G button is optional tigerberry Oh hey, finally there's gesture typing for Hungarian! It only took... well, how many years? Too many, considering that other keyboards, even OEM keyboards have been able to do it since ages. And lemme check... yep, still no gesture typing for Japanese in QUERTY mode. Come on Google, even Huawei's keyboard can do it! (I miss the Xperia keyboard. :( I wish it was available for non-Sony phones...) Gwaur I wish there was a way to completely hide the extra row where that G icon is. I found a setting for hiding the icon but the row stayed. It's a goddamn waste of space for someone who's not gonna use it. Fahad Ahmed Why there's no Chinese language included??? That's disappointing. Természetjáró Gayboard. Sorry, I'll show myself out... Patel Nisha I would be happy with a backspace key! Or better still, when using a stylus, thus knowing I went to each letter precisely when swaping, the damn thing would input my entry versus some substitute word! Marco Reali I love GBOARD but two things are very very frustrating: 1. There is no suggestion bar when typing in Chrome. 2. The language switch takes to long to recognise which language I'm typing. I wish they woul reinstate the button for those who want that. I switch language pretty often and I find it horrible to have to re-type words over and over before it's in the right language. WestIndiesKING anyone else getting a little bit of lag when you first start it up after a while of not pulling up the keyboard? I am getting 1-3 seconds of lag before it starts only if i havent used it in a while, after that it flies. Pixel XL 128gb Daddyo Gordon Am I the only one who feels the google keyboard has gotten bloated and too big? There should be an option to keep it at one language, as pioneered by monolingual on the mac (gets rid of a couple Gb of unused languages that waste storage).

Carter President Donald Trump is poised to sign legislation to overturn Federal Communications Commission rules forbidding internet service providers from selling data they have vacuumed up about the online habits of their customers. Privacy groups are understandably perturbed. But I wonder whether all the brouhaha is just shouting at the horse to come back long after he’s left the barn. Yes, it’s a little disturbing that Verizon and AT&T will be able to start behaving like Google and Facebook. But Google and Facebook are already behaving like Google and Facebook. They recognize what we ourselves refuse to see: That we are no longer entirely human. We may not (yet) be sporting wired implants, but with so much of life spent online, we are increasingly integrated into the digital world. Our smartphones and tablets and computers long ago ceased to be our servants. They are also not our masters. Whether we are at work or at home, in the street or in the car, at school or on vacation, the devices that were once our tools are now our partners and our symbionts. The day has become unimaginable without our ability to connect at leisure. We march through the world shedding digital information with every step we take. Whether we are browsing online or browsing in a store, our symbionts surround us and embrace us ... and steal from us. We like to call the bits we leave behind “our” data, but the truth is that what we shed in our online travels we also abandon —if not as a matter of law, then as a matter of practical fact. Most of the time we do little to protect our leavings. We dribble data in our path and never look back, on the cheery assumption that nobody will ever want to examine what we have tossed aside. For the internet behemoths —Facebook Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google—the data constitute a treasure-trove. Their business models are built around finding ever more complex methods of mining what we leave behind for information that advertisers will buy to target us, anonymously but effectively. Yes, the algorithms work imperfectly—all of us have stories of being served ads for products we hate—but they work. The giant internet service providers— Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc. in particular—look enviously upon the ability of other tech companies to monetize our digital trails. The ISPs peer greedily into their vaults, packed with data potentially even more detailed than what Google and Facebook collect, and wonder why the companies whose signals ride their fiber optic networks can exploit this vast collection and the owners of the network cannot. In their version of the story, the ISPs try to dip their toes in the water, and a Washington establishment that sits in awe of Google and Facebook reacts with horror and bans them from the beach. With the FCC rules out of the way, it’s everybody into the sea. This isn’t the end of privacy. Privacy ended already. The FCC rules about to be cast aside, like many other regulatory and legislative barriers, represented mere fingers in the dike. Nowadays a Wal-Mart or Nordstrom’s might use your mobile phone, connected to the store’s Wi-Fi, to follow you around the store, combining browsing habits with buying history to personalize offers that are then sent straight to the phone. In his fascinating if disturbing book “The Aisles Have Eyes,” Joseph Turow sharply criticizes this practice, but also tells us where it came from: the need to compete with Amazon, which with its reams of data about customers can both target ads and price discriminate minute-by-minute. If the brick-and-mortar stores couldn’t find a way to exploit similar technologies, they would be left in the dust even faster. A National Security Agency data center opened three years ago in Utah is estimated to be able to store several exabytes (a quintillion bytes) of data, and although the organization is no longer allowed to store most data on our telephone calls, privacy advocates believe that considerable information about our internet usage might be preserved there. (I am not saying they’re right.) And don’t forget the hackers, who do a lot more than occasionally raid the database of a retail shop. Now that it is possible to scan every port on the internet (the IPv4 space) in mere minutes, any connected device is likely to be attacked. If the device is poorly protected, it will be hacked. Not might be. Will be. Last year, the Atlantic magazine constructed a virtual wireless toaster to see how much time would pass before an attack was launched. The toaster, which mimicked an actual device connected to the IPv4 space, went live at 1:12 p.m. The first hacking attempt came at 1:53 p.m. By midnight the virtual device had been attacked more than 300 times. And our big privacy worry is that Verizon and AT&T will now be allowed to behave like Google and Facebook? We lost long ago the battle to be able to protect the data we shed in our wake as we move through the world. The FCC rules were a desperate throw, and, in the long run, perhaps not an important one. It’s time we better armed ourselves. We can delete our cookies when we are done browsing, and we can travel mainly to websites using HTTPS rather than HTTP protocols. But experts agree that such measures are only partly helpful. Using “do not track” commands probably doesn’t help at all. Most likely we will see another online civil war, such as the one being fought now between users of ad-blocking software on the one hand, and, on the other, websites that support themselves with advertising income. I expect that we will see more apps like TrackMeNot, which runs in the background in your browser, intermittently sending out random search queries, in an effort to make it harder for anyone who might be tracking you (including your ISP) to assemble accurate personalized information. In the end we should expect little return from our efforts. We will go on shedding data and others will go on scooping it up. We made the big decision when we chose to live in symbiosis with the internet. Remember your high school biology: In a symbiotic relationship, both parties profit.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Android App Revenue To Overtake iOS App Store This Year, Predicts App Annie By Zara Ali Mar 30, 2017 13Shares Share Tweet Submit According to a report by mobile apps analytics firm App Annie, which shows Apple’s App Store is ahead of Google’s Play Store regarding revenue collection. Well, this has been a trend for long, App Store has forever remained on top regarding income, but the reports also predict a wave of change this year for Android. The research firm predicts that Android will surpass iOS concerning app revenue generation this year. However, there are contributing factors to this prediction; App Annie is saying this after amalgamating third-party Android app stores. For standalone Google’s Play Store performance, it will still stay behind Apple’s App Store for quite a long time. It could only take the lead when third-party downloads are also valued. Whereas, App Store’s individual earning way more than Play Store. And it will continue its leads until the year 2021 or farther. Related SoundCloud For iOS Gains Support For Chromecast, Shared Playback And More Advertisement App Annie states that Apple’s App Store is going to remain the individual most successful app store throughout the prediction period. It will collect more than $60 billion in gross earnings in 2021. The cumulative income of Google’s Play Store and third-party Android app stores shall overtake App Store in 2017 because of their stronger market presence and installed app base. Notably, the third-party Android app stores earned $10 billion as revenue, last year. App Annie expects this number to reach $20 billion this year. Third-party Android app stores also include apps from Baidu, Huawei, Tencent, Xiaomi, and others. One of the main reasons behind the growth in third-party Android stores is China along with other growing markets like Mexico, Brazil, and Indonesia. Regarding Android app revenue, the US, China, Japan, South Korea, and the UK are projected to contribute 85% to the revenue, which is a 10% jump from the year 2016. For downloads, markets like China, India, U.S., Brazil, and Indonesia contributed 54 percent last year, and that number is going to stay stable through the year 2021, as per App Annie’s projections. Also, App Annie portends that global app downloads would cross 352 billion in 2021 while revenue could hit $139 billion mark. Apple’s App Store will constitute the larger part of the revenue in 2021, which will bring its income to more than $60 billion during 2021.

Every time I buy a new car, about once a decade, I buy a new copy of the venerable Rand McNally Road Atlas. Recently, I bought a Honda with Android Auto. While I still tuck the Rand McNally between the seats for seeing the big picture, for route planning I rely on Google, my smartphone and my Android Auto-equipped car. Many travelers already rely on their smartphones for navigating while driving. They spend $25 for a windshield or dash mount and follow the maps and directions displayed on the phone's screen. Depending on the phone's screen, this may not be ideal. An iPhone 5s may be too small, while the jumbo iPhone 7 Plus or Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge might be cumbersome for mounting and placement. The screen sizes of most smartphones are smaller than is preferable for maps while driving. You could spend from $400 to $2,000 extra when buying your car to include a built-in navigation system. That normally incorporates a gorgeous, large display screen with an internal GPS system. Outboard dedicated GPS systems, which cost from about $100 to $270, work well, but it's one more piece of gear that can be lost or stolen, and that you must mount to the dash or windshield. The biggest names are Garmin and TomTom, with screen sizes ranging from 5 to 7 inches. Depending on model and brand, it may include a subscription to traffic reports and lifetime map upgrades. These devices show speed limits and other important data. You can even choose a pleasing voice to speak the directions. You can enjoy the best of all worlds when you buy a new car that includes Android Auto or Apple CarPlay. Usually, these do not add to the cost of the car. Not all cars offer both apps, so you may need to choose your car by whether you use an Apple or Android smartphone. Having just completed a 1,900-mile roundtrip drive to a relatively obscure place in Georgia using Google Maps on my ZTE smartphone linked to my Honda through Android Auto, I give it five stars. Google's voice recognition system understood addresses on the first try every time. The voice instructions from Google Maps were clear and accurate. In fact, when asked to find the brand new Panera in one town, it immediately located it and provided directions. The screen display on the Honda's 7-inch screen is clear and easy to read. A cellphone data plan enables the system, which uses very little data. You probably could drive 100,000 miles before using as much data as one HD movie. Google Maps is a free service, but, of course, the trade is that Google tracks you and knows your travel history. Speaking of Google, I received the following: "Caroline Rana here from OutCast on behalf of Nest. I wanted to reach out to request a correction to your article in The News-Gazette where you said the Nest thermostat 'knows whether you're home or away, records your temperature settings and numerous other environmental factors, and sends the information back to Alphabet's parent, Google, to sell.' This is not true and data is not for sale to anyone. Also sharing a statement here that you can attribute to a Nest spokesperson: 'Nest has always taken consumer privacy seriously. Customer information and accounts are used only to provide and improve Nest products and services offered by Nest. Please see nest.com/privacy for more information.'" I pursued this with Ms. Rana, asking why I could not request Alphabet to stop collecting data on my Nest without disabling most of its features. She failed to provide a satisfactory answer. She confirmed that if I demanded Alphabet stop collecting data, then I could no longer access my Nest via WiFi, the entire reason I purchased it. She could not justify exactly why this data collection was essential. Rich Warren, who lives in the Champaign area, is a longtime reviewer of consumer electronics.

Read the recap of our "Women in Social Media" conversation. Explore more:  security online security data security website strategy Why Every Website Owner Should Care About (and Convert to) HTTPS April 02, 2017 Donna Duncan Most people know, or at least suspect, that it’s unwise to purchase items over a public Internet connection - but they might not know why. One of the reasons is because of a possible 'man-in-the-middle' attack - a MITM attack is when someone inserts him or herself into the middle of your, and the website you are visiting’s, Internet connection and impersonates both parties in order to gain access to sensitive information like userIDs, passwords, name, address, telephone number, and credit card data. Let’s say, for example, Ann (A) is in her favorite coffee shop browsing Best Buy (B’s) eCommerce website and wants to make a purchase. There's nothing to stop a malicious man-in-the-middle (M) from inserting himself into Ann and Best Buy’s conversation. He can capture, and possibly alter, the data that gets transmitted. If Ann makes a purchase, he can adjust the order quantity and/or steal her identity. Ann and the website she’s visiting are both at risk. HTTPS Protects In-Transit Data Enter HTTPS. HTTP (without the “s”) stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol, which is the standard and agreed-upon format for transmitting data between two devices on the Internet. Just like the default language of aviation is English, the default language of computers is HTTP. HTTPS, on the other hand, stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure. It's a way to help protect conversations between two computers by layering a security certificate and encryption on top. Here’s how it works. Let’s revisit Ann’s shopping experience and pretend she's shopping at Adorama (D) instead of Best Buy. Adorama has a secure (HTTPS) website. When Ann uses her browser to connect with Adorama: Her browser requests and Adorama sends, an independently verified security transaction that certifies the web server Ann is trying to connect to does, in fact, belong to Adorama. Adorama also sends an encryption key to Ann’s browser. The key will be used to encrypt or scramble any subsequent transactions between the two. Only Adorama has the decryption key - even if a malicious man-in-the-middle intercepts their exchange, he or she will not be able to alter, delete, or make any sense of subsequent conversations. Both parties are protected. HTTPS is added security but not total protection - already some folks are figuring out ways around the certification process. It's not perfect, but it's a step in the right direction, and it's likely to improve even more as time goes on. Why Convert Now? HTTPS has been around since 1994 - so why is there a sudden push for everyone to convert? What changed? Concerned that users are not recognizing or heeding Google’s previously neutral and ambiguous labeling of unsecure websites, on September 8, 2016 Google announced that beginning in January 2017, it will explicitly start labeling all HTTP connections as not secure. “Historically, Chrome has not explicitly labeled HTTP connections as non-secure. Beginning in January 2017 (Chrome 56), we’ll mark HTTP pages that collect passwords or credit cards as non-secure, as part of a long-term plan to mark all HTTP sites as non-secure. In following releases, we will continue to extend HTTP warnings, for example, by labeling HTTP pages as “not secure” in Incognito mode, where users may have higher expectations of privacy. Eventually, we plan to label all HTTP pages as non-secure, and change the HTTP security indicator to the red triangle that we use for broken HTTPS.” So far, we've not seen the “not secure” label, we've only seen the already familiar gray circled letter “i” displayed in browser address bars when websites are not secure. Here’s an example using Best Buy’s website (below). Google has, however, amped up their labeling of secure websites, like Adorama’s (below). Labeling now includes a green padlock, the word “Secure”, and the green letters “https” on all websites that have been completely and successfully converted. Implications For Website Owners If you own a website that captures userIDs and passwords or credit card data, you'll soon be labeled as “Not Secure” when visitors are using the Chrome browser. This is bound to raise concerns and deter people from wanting to transact with you, especially if you’re asking for any type of personal data - email addresses, for example, to build your mailing list.  Website visitors will easily be able to recognize unsecure websites and find better, more secure, alternatives. If you own an informational (non-eCommerce) website and think you’re off the hook, think again. Non-eCommerce website owners also risk losing the trust and confidence of website visitors. 25% of the world’s websites are built with Wordpress, a content management system that is accessed, administered, and maintained using a UserID and password. Joomla and Drupal, Wordpress’s closest competitors, also use userIDs and passwords. These sites will eventually be flagged as non-secure unless they are converted over to HTTPS. As a website owner, you should also be aware that anyone who intercepts the transmission of userID and password data will be able to add, change and delete content on your website. It’s not only website visitors who are at risk, website owners also need to protect their data. Implications For SEO In addition to the obvious benefit of securing the trust and confidence of your audience, there is also a search engine optimization (SEO) benefit when you migrate over to HTTPS. Google announced HTTPS as a ranking factor in 2014. “For now it's only a very lightweight signal — affecting fewer than 1% of global queries, and carrying less weight than other signals such as high-quality content — while we give webmasters time to switch to HTTPS. But over time, we may decide to strengthen it, because we’d like to encourage all website owners to switch from HTTP to HTTPS to keep everyone safe on the web.” At the time, the lightweight incentive wasn’t enough to motivate most non-eCommerce website owners to migrate because of the work involved and the potential to lose SEO equity. When you convert your website to HTTPS, you're effectively changing your Internet address - that means you should give Google (and other search engines) a “change of address” notification, also known as a 301 or 302 redirect. Traditionally, a redirect diluted your SEO equity or ability to rank by as much as 15%. That recently changed. In February 2016, Google’s John Mueller announced that SEO equity or PageRank will no longer be lost when a 301 or 302 redirect is used in conjunction with an HTTP to HTTPS migration. Skeptical SEO’s doubted the truth of this but in July 2016, another Google employee, Gary Illyes, tweeted the same thing and Barry Schwartz at Search Engine Land confirmed it.  There's no longer an SEO penalty when you implement HTTPS. The previously lightweight signal could actually help boost your rankings. Now Ann and other website visitors can feel safe knowing secure-labeled websites will protect their identity and data. Website owners can too.

Google’s new phone is one of the best Android smartphones yet. The more we use it the more apps fill up the storage. Owners who don’t want to be bothered with constant app updates typically have a few questions about managing the Google Play Store. Read: 17 Best Google Pixel Cases Those that don’t want the Pixel updating on its own, or rather not be bothered by tons of notifications can change these settings. This guide is perfect for iPhone converts or a first-time Android user. Read on for more details on dealing with app updates. By default the Pixel (and most Android phones) will update apps automatically, which is the easiest way to leave things for most owners. That said, some owners want to control everything. Whether that’s to save data and update on WiFi only, or see and know what is being updated. Also, the Play Store automatically adds an icon for new downloads to the homescreen. That’s one more setting we can quickly disable. Everyone has different needs, wants, or preferences for settings on a phone. Below we’ll explain where and how to change the Google Play Store to fit your needs. Instructions This isn’t an option in settings. Instead we’ll navigate to the actual Google Play Store app on your phone. Labeled as “Play Store” in the app drawer. Once it’s opened select the top left (3-lines) menu button next to the “Google Play” search bar. From here just scroll down to “Settings” and select that as shown below. Now the first option from the list is what we’re looking for. It says to automatically update apps. Tap here, and choose what works best for you. From only updating over WiFi, or do not auto update apps. This is a user preference. Some want everything done for them, others want to see and control everything. Selecting “Do Not auto-update apps” means users will constantly be notified that updates are available. I chose this to be able to see what’s updating, look at changelogs, and know what’s going on with my device. Then, as we mentioned above, in here you can also uncheck the option that automatically puts icons on the homescreen. What Should You Choose? Average smartphone users or those new to Android should just let the smartphone do everything for them. Some hate getting notifications for updates all the time, if so set it to auto. It’s all about user preference. Owners that use auto-update won’t know what’s new, because they didn’t see the changelog. Users will just notice changes to popular apps like Facebook, YouTube, or even games you may enjoy. At the end of the day select what’s best for you, and enjoy. These steps are the same for essentially all Android smartphones and tablets with the Google Play Store. One Response 04/02/2017 Bernard Reply I am a new Pixel owner. Sadly was an die hard old school flip phone user. Liked the Google Pixel and seems pretty easy to use.

Google always does a great job, from the Pokemon Google Maps overlay to a smart mailbox, but there are a few from other companies worth mentioning. Here's a rundown of all the hillarious (or strange) tech-related April Fools Day jokes from around the web. Google Gnome One of Google's product launches from last year was the Google Home, a $129 smart speaker with Google Assistant. Now the company is teasing the "Google Gnome," an outside version of the Home. You can ask it weather questions, let it control your lawnmower and other tools, and even dress it up in accessories. The Google Gnome has a page on the Google Store, but unfortunately you can't buy it. I really want a rain coat for my Google Home, though. Mrs. Pac-Man in Google Maps For April Fools' 2015, Google added Pac-Man into Google Maps and Ingress. This year, Mrs Pac-Man is invading Google Maps. For regions of the world already on April 1st, a new Mrs. Pac-Man button is visible on the mobile app. You then have to control Mrs. Pac-Man on real-life streets, and of course, outrun the Ghosts. Google's Bubble Wrap Keyboard (English subtitles are available) Google Japan's prank is pretty funny - it's a bubble wrap keyboard. The idea is to pop bubbles on a bubble wrap sheet to form words, then feed the sheet through a reader to send the message. Some of the bubble wrap sheets are even scented. Google Assistant Google has plenty of Easter Eggs in Google Assistant, and as you might expect, there's one for April Fools' Day too. When asked, Assistant will offer advice on how not to get pranked, such as "If something seems too good to be true today, it probably is." Google Wind Google's Netherlands division has its own April Fools' Day gag, named 'Google Wind.' The idea is to use machine learning to control the weather, using Holland's famous windmills. I'll admit, this one is pretty great. Netflix Live Will Arnet has been in plenty of Netflix original content, from BoJack Horseman to A Series of Unfortunate Events. For April Fools' Day, Netflix is proud to share 'Netflix Live', which is nearly an hour of Arnett commentating ordinary events like toasting bread and completing a crossword puzzle. It's actually funnier than it sounds. You can watch the full thing here (a Netflix subscription is required). T-Mobile ONEsie T-Mobile's prank is a onesie, with "full-body coverage" and a built-in 4G LTE hotspot. You can actually buy it for $40, but the real one doesn't have any tech inside it. Hulu Hu With the claim that the human attention span has "dropped to eight seconds," Hulu has released 'Hu.' It's just a library of short clips from existing Hulu content, and you actually need an account to see them. This is probably the lamest April Fools' Day gag in the list - better luck next year, guys. OnePlus Dash drink OnePlus is really proud of its Dash Charge feature, even to the point of enlisting celebrities to talk about it. For April Fools', the company made real Dash Charge energy drinks. You can find our review of the drink here. Lyft Mono For April Fools' Day, Lyft has announced the 'Lyft Mono.' It's a wearable glove, vaguely resembling a Nintendo Power Glove. This gag is actually real, and once you put it on and get the app, sticking out your thumb will hail a Lyft cab. You can sign up to for a chance to get one here. Honor BFF We all need some positive reinforcement every now and then, right? Honor thinks so, and created the Honor BFF. This imaginary phone uses machine learning to periodically give you compliments and motivation. Hopefully it ships with Android 7.1 Nougat. Google Haptic Helpers This is probably my favorite gag so far. In order to create a more realistic virtual reality experience, you can schedule a "haptic helper" to come to your house and help create a more realistic environment. Just watch the video, it's hilarious. Amazon Petlexa Alexa is cool and all, but your furry friends need one too. As the name implies, Petlexa is Alexa for your pets. Contour by SlickWraps Putting a skin on your phone or tablet is too much work. For April Fool's Day, Slickwraps is teasing the 'Countour' - a machine that sprays on device skins. Frankly, I'm not sure if this is actually real or not, but there is a page for it on SlickWrap's store. Nvidia GTX G-Assist How many times have you been playing an online game, only to be interrupted by someone in real life? NVIDIA has made the 'G Assist,' a flash drive that can take over for you if you're busy. It can also help you beat boss battles, and provides periodic reminders to consume energy drinks. More information and a video can be found here. Google's data center on Mars If you have important data, you need a backup. That's why Google announced its first interplanetary data center, named "Ziggy Stardust," on the Google Cloud Platform Blog today. Located in the Gale Crater on Mars, it will store a cache of data from Earth to prevent irrecoverable loss when a planetary disaster strikes. Google hopes to finish the data center by 2018. LineageOS' mascot CyanogenMod's mascot, Cid, was one of the most recognizable icons in the Android community. As the spiritual successor to CyanogenMod, LineageOS has created its own mascot - 'Ink'. The project also announced 'Br0zip,' an artificial intelligence that can port LineageOS to any device in no time at all. Chromebook accessories Even though most Chromebooks can now run Android apps, you still can't use your Chromebook like an Android phone/tablet for all use cases. Until now, that is. Google has announced a Chromebook Groupie Stick (seen above), a Chromebook Cardboard headset, and a Chromebook armband. See the company's blog post for more info. Exynos Yoga Processor Remember when curved phones were a thing? Maybe we'll see more in the coming months, because Samsung has just unveiled the Exynos Yoga Processor - the first flexible mobile SoC. Anyone up for a Galaxy Flex? Carved screen protector Carved is a small Indiana-based phone case company, but now they are working on a wooden screen protector. Why hasn't this been done before? I'll take ten. I'm Feeling Woof/I'm Feeling Meow By force-touching the Google app icon in iOS, you can select "I'm Feeling Woof" or "I'm Feeling Meow." These give your pets access to the stuff they care about - from dog food to balls of yarn. More info can be found on Google's blog post. Waze maps for Mars According to the company's blog, Waze is has begun to map the surface of Mars. Certain members of the Waze community will also be sent to the Red Planet to more accurately map the surface. JerryRigEverything's NoPhone video If you haven't heard about it, the NoPhone is a solid piece of plastic designed to simulate the feeling of a phone in your pocket. I'm not really sure if anyone uses it, but JerryRigEverything is happy to break it just as much as any other phone. Google Translate for Heptapod B Using machine learning, Google Translate can now decrypt messages written in Heptapod B - the language from the film Arrival. On an unrelated note, it looks like someone from Google is still rocking a Nexus 10. See Google's blog post for more info. Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s ASUS has an April Fools gag too - the Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s Veritas Blue Limited Special Edition. I would probably buy this phone. MKBHD's Nokia 3310 review You may have heard about the updated Nokia 3310, but it turns out the original is an amazing smartphone. Okay, maybe not, but the video is pretty funny. Open GApps Femto Do you need to flash the latest Gapps package on your device, but you don't have a stable network connection? Not to worry, the Open GApps Femto package is here to help. It uses the United States HAARP service (which is not real, but just pretend) to download the latest GApps package. You can find more info at the GApps blog.   That concludes our coverage of April Fools' Day in the tech world. Let us know in the comments below which gag you liked the most!

Yeah they actuqally had me going until I compared a whois of kodi.tv vs kickasstorrents.com, a site that actually was seized. The whois data would show that it is not official. Derik Taylor So this is one I find interesting. Could it technically be a criminal offense to falsify a domain seizure? How would that work? Greg Abbott Doubt it, technically a website isn't an official document. mondeca I hope every year that Google will announce something real and awesome on April Fools' Day, like they did with Gmail. Once again, I am disappointed. JG It isn't technically April Fools Day yet... Least not in the US...

Trooper311 Gimme dat gnome yo. abqnm The Google Haptic Helpers was OK, until they applied the "I Voted!" sticker to the guy's shirt. I was laughing and crying at the same time. Corbin Davenport Yep, that had me laughing too. AdrianFDiratama . How about JG I'd actually like to see Google produce the Google Gnome.... All they'd need to do is add a battery (and Qi charging) to a Google Home and stick it in a new Gnome shell... Make sure its IP68 and maybe even MIL-STD-810G certified. It'd be a fun little gadget to put on the picnic table of your next summer back yard get together. Pump out some tunes, order pizza & Ubers for everyone to go home in, etc... Or take out when you work in the garden & don't want to get your phone dirty... Maybe even produce one with an LTE radio (and GPS). Then you could take it out of WiFi range camping. Wake up and find him chilling next to your tent in his little chair "Hey Google, how's today's weather? When does the rafting place open? How far away from the camp site is it?" cdotlawrence Maybe like a more customizable (from a looks standpoint), durable, & usable-on-go version of Home? Google Home Pro/Ultra? Interesting idea, but not sure why you wouldn't do most of the things it would do on your phone. Some specific use cases like you mentioned but beyond those, idk. Guess it'd be a highly functional, portable, durable and customizable speaker? Suicide_Note Ms. Pac-Man in Maps is live for me here in the US, even though it isn't April 1st yet.

Everything you need to know about Congress’ decision to expose your data to internet providers Posted Mar 29, 2017 by Devin Coldewey 0 SHARES Next Story Ashton Kutcher’s Sound Ventures hires a new managing partner and COO Advertisement A joint resolution has just been passed by both houses of Congress and all but signed by the president, reversing the Broadband Privacy Rule, a piece of regulation from the FCC that made some inconvenient changes to the ways internet providers can collect and sell the data they collect on consumers. But what exactly can they do now that they couldn’t last week? Well, I’ve got good news and bad news. The good news, such as it is, is this: Congressional Republicans (most of them; 15 representatives voted against, it’s worth mentioning) initiated this joint resolution in a great hurry because the privacy rule hadn’t actually taken effect yet. So technically you’re not losing any protections — they’re just preventing you from getting them in the first place. I’ll come back to that, but for now let’s look at the facts around what these protections would have been, had Congress permitted you to enjoy them. What was the rule, exactly? The Rule, as I’ll call it (the full name is pretty cumbersome), updated existing requirements for broadband internet providers in a few major areas. Under the Rule: ISPs are required to be transparent about what data they collect, how they use it and with whom they intend to share it. ISPs must get advance permission from consumers (i.e. users must opt in) before using “customer proprietary information.” That’s a category defined by the FCC and encompasses what you would normally expect to be protected — medical data, social security number — and adds information that is not inherently personal but the large-scale tracking of which most people would disapprove of: web browsing history and application usage history. (This is the part that’s gotten the most coverage.) ISPs must take “reasonable measures” in security terms to protect that information, and in the event of a major breach (more than 5,000 accounts affected) must inform various parties, and the affected consumers, within a week. No providing price breaks for lower privacy measures — for instance, lowering monthly charges if a consumer agrees to be tracked. Notice was given (but no actual rule yet proposed) that the practice of forced arbitration, which limits the legal means consumers have for redress to companies’ internal processes, was soon to be reviewed as well. OK, so now ISPs can do all that stuff? Kind of. Bear with me for a second. The primary argument for repealing these rules was that the Federal Trade Commission already does this privacy protection stuff, and has for years. And it’s kind of true! The FTC is in fact on the job when, say, Target’s loyalty card system gets hacked, or if Facebook or Twitter were colluding against its users. And it still is. But in 2015, the FCC exerted authority specifically over internet providers, taking them out of the FTC’s jurisdiction. Related Articles Congress just voted to let internet providers sell your browsing history The FCC is talking about everything but the imminent repeal of its internet privacy rules FCC weakens net neutrality rule in a prelude to larger rollbacks The Rule we’re talking about today — based on the FTC’s rules and on the Obama administration’s Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights — was meant to quickly fill that regulatory gap, and augment it a bit with ISP-specific things like browsing history, which the FTC didn’t consider as needing protection. The repeal of the Rule is, ostensibly, to put it all back in the hands of the FTC. But here’s the thing: Right now, the FTC is legally barred from regulating ISPs! The FCC’s move in 2015 actually made room for the FTC to step in when problems were happening on the business side of the ISP — for example, price-fixing at a national level. But a recent court decision (which really no one likes, for the record) put ISPs solely in the jurisdiction of the FCC. Get it? Both the FCC and the FTC are now barred from making privacy rules for ISPs. There’s no cop on the beat whatsoever! Technically the FCC still has some residual authority over telecoms, but the current commission has made it clear they don’t consider ISPs telecoms, so they won’t exert it. In other words, right now, ISPs have a pretty free hand when it comes to their subscribers’ data. They’re not going to go hog-wild, of course — this power vacuum will only last until the FCC gets around to reversing its 2015 decision, putting the FTC back where it was before. But in the meantime, yes, they can get away with quite a bit: ISPs can record and sell your browsing history, data on which apps and services you use and so on. ISPs don’t have to tell you what they collect or who they sell it to beyond what they volunteer to say in their privacy policy. ISPs may or may not be required to notify you in case of a breach (this differs state by state). ISPs can still force you to resolve complaints or violations in their internal system via forced arbitration. ISPs could give subscribers a discount for agreeing to share personal information — but why bother when they get it for free? It’s also a great time to experiment with invasive practices like ad injection and supercookies, and questionable ones like zero rating. Why not, right? They’re not going to do anything that will get them in trouble with the FTC later, but the ISP-specific improvements made by the FCC aren’t coming back any time soon, as we’ll see later. And it’s unlikely that the FTC will adopt similar rules, since that would be like admitting this one was a good idea in the first place. But don’t Facebook and Google see more anyway? Facebook, Google, Amazon, Netflix and a hundred other services online also track you as closely as they can, it’s true. That’s the other big argument against this rule: Why enact these more stringent regulations for ISPs while edge providers (as they’re called) get away scot-free? Well, the answer is threefold. First, they’re not getting away with anything. Most edge providers are still under the FTC’s jurisdiction, since they’re not broadband providers. A big exception is Alphabet/Google, which gets to play the ISP card because of its Fiber service. But as we noted before, that court decision doesn’t make anyone happy and probably doesn’t have long to live. If people were really worried about the privacy threat of edge providers, well, the FCC is the wrong tree to bark up. They’ve got nothing to do with each other. Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg via Getty Images Second, ISPs may not have the same window as Facebook on your activity, but they have a unique and broad one. They can’t see what you do on Google (generally, queries and content are encrypted), but they can see that you went from Google to the WebMD page for a certain affliction, spent 15 minutes there, then to your healthcare provider, then the page of a local clinic, then your credit union. What information would you draw from that? Now imagine you have a few million more data points and a big team of machine learning experts ready to help. The metadata you produce from ordinary activity on your home internet connection can paint a disturbingly accurate picture of your life, from your shopping preferences to your medical woes. And, of course, the things you carefully keep hidden in incognito mode are still visible to your ISP. Data collected by ISPs is different from what’s collected by edge providers, but as a piece of the puzzle that is your online habits and persona, it’s very valuable nonetheless. Third, users of services like Facebook and Gmail have other options. People make conscious decisions to limit what they post online, or to use an email service that doesn’t harvest data for ads. They’re aware, in using these services, that they are trading a bit of privacy for a free service. That isn’t the case with ISPs. Not only are users unable to control what traffic the ISP sees, but frequently they have no alternative; no Protonmail, no DuckDuckGo, no Signal. Much of the population gets to choose between two or three providers if they have any choice at all. This lack of choice puts ISPs in a different category from edge providers. So while privacy threats do come from many directions, ISPs are no exception, and, in fact, constitute a special case that, arguably, deserves special rules. What can I do to protect myself? Not a lot, honestly. HTTPS Everywhere is a good start — that makes sure that when you connect to a website, you use a secure connection that, apart from the base URL, the ISP can’t snoop on. Other anti-tracking software (Adblock, Disconnect, etc.) will primarily affect what edge providers know. VPNs are often suggested as a way to disguise your traffic, and they work, but you have to pay for them (I can’t recommend any free ones, at least). Log into your account at your ISP and look through the options — you might be able to opt out of certain practices. You can try calling too, to see what you can get out of them on the phone. But keep in mind their hands aren’t really tied and their privacy policies are largely voluntary. Are we all just up the creek forever, then? It’s hard to say for certain, but things are going to get worse before they get better. See, the FCC’s rule was debated and tweaked for much of last year but only passed just before the election, with the various requirements it contained scheduled to enter effect over the next year. (Some considered this to be politically motivated, but the alternative seems to be that the FCC just does nothing during election years in case there’s a reversal of power, which is ridiculous.) NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty Images Congress had a little help here from the new FCC chairman, who gamely rescinded the parts of the rule due to come into effect in early March. Had he not done that, you would be losing some protections. But he did, so you never got them. And the bad news is you probably never will. But because of the timing, the repeal was performed under the Congressional Review Act, which is a balance-of-power thing that lets Congress revisit recent legislation from the latter days of the previous administration and reverse it. It’s sort of so a party in power doesn’t just pack its final days with all kinds of mad bills that remain law even if power changes hands. Using the CRA has the additional effect of preventing similar legislation or rules from being proposed again — it’ll take another act of Congress to make it legal to do that again. Before that happens, you can expect the FCC and Congress to roll back the order that established the former’s authority over ISPs and enacted net neutrality rules. So not only will it be a few years, but we’ll have that to deal with, as well. Why would they do this? It’s an easy play for Republicans in Congress (this didn’t have to be a partisan issue, but it ended up being one) to both stay in the good graces of the truly enormous ISP and telecoms lobbies, while simultaneously saying they’re standing against bloated bureaucracy and the Obama administration. Big internet providers are the undisputed winners here, with conservative members of Congress coming a close second. They sold you out, plain and simple.

Google always does a great job, from the Pokemon Google Maps overlay to a smart mailbox, but there are a few from other companies worth mentioning. Here's a rundown of all the hillarious (or strange) tech-related April Fools Day jokes from around the web. Google Gnome One of Google's product launches from last year was the Google Home, a $129 smart speaker with Google Assistant. Now the company is teasing the "Google Gnome," an outside version of the Home. You can ask it weather questions, let it control your lawnmower and other tools, and even dress it up in accessories. The Google Gnome has a page on the Google Store, but unfortunately you can't buy it. I really want a rain coat for my Google Home, though. Mrs. Pac-Man in Google Maps For April Fools' 2015, Google added Pac-Man into Google Maps and Ingress. This year, Mrs Pac-Man is invading Google Maps. For regions of the world already on April 1st, a new Mrs. Pac-Man button is visible on the mobile app. You then have to control Mrs. Pac-Man on real-life streets, and of course, outrun the Ghosts. Google's Bubble Wrap Keyboard (English subtitles are available) Google Japan's prank is pretty funny - it's a bubble wrap keyboard. The idea is to pop bubbles on a bubble wrap sheet to form words, then feed the sheet through a reader to send the message. Some of the bubble wrap sheets are even scented. Google Assistant Google has plenty of Easter Eggs in Google Assistant, and as you might expect, there's one for April Fools' Day too. When asked, Assistant will offer advice on how not to get pranked, such as "If something seems too good to be true today, it probably is." Google Wind Google's Netherlands division has its own April Fools' Day gag, named 'Google Wind.' The idea is to use machine learning to control the weather, using Holland's famous windmills. I'll admit, this one is pretty great. Netflix Live Will Arnet has been in plenty of Netflix original content, from BoJack Horseman to A Series of Unfortunate Events. For April Fools' Day, Netflix is proud to share 'Netflix Live', which is nearly an hour of Arnett commentating ordinary events like toasting bread and completing a crossword puzzle. It's actually funnier than it sounds. You can watch the full thing here (a Netflix subscription is required). T-Mobile ONEsie T-Mobile's prank is a onesie, with "full-body coverage" and a built-in 4G LTE hotspot. You can actually buy it for $40, but the real one doesn't have any tech inside it. Hulu Hu With the claim that the human attention span has "dropped to eight seconds," Hulu has released 'Hu.' It's just a library of short clips from existing Hulu content, and you actually need an account to see them. This is probably the lamest April Fools' Day gag in the list - better luck next year, guys. OnePlus Dash drink OnePlus is really proud of its Dash Charge feature, even to the point of enlisting celebrities to talk about it. For April Fools', the company made real Dash Charge energy drinks. You can find our review of the drink here. Lyft Mono For April Fools' Day, Lyft has announced the 'Lyft Mono.' It's a wearable glove, vaguely resembling a Nintendo Power Glove. This gag is actually real, and once you put it on and get the app, sticking out your thumb will hail a Lyft cab. You can sign up to for a chance to get one here. Honor BFF We all need some positive reinforcement every now and then, right? Honor thinks so, and created the Honor BFF. This imaginary phone uses machine learning to periodically give you compliments and motivation. Hopefully it ships with Android 7.1 Nougat. Google Haptic Helpers This is probably my favorite gag so far. In order to create a more realistic virtual reality experience, you can schedule a "haptic helper" to come to your house and help create a more realistic environment. Just watch the video, it's hilarious. Amazon Petlexa Alexa is cool and all, but your furry friends need one too. As the name implies, Petlexa is Alexa for your pets. Contour by SlickWraps Putting a skin on your phone or tablet is too much work. For April Fool's Day, Slickwraps is teasing the 'Countour' - a machine that sprays on device skins. Frankly, I'm not sure if this is actually real or not, but there is a page for it on SlickWrap's store. Nvidia GTX G-Assist How many times have you been playing an online game, only to be interrupted by someone in real life? NVIDIA has made the 'G Assist,' a flash drive that can take over for you if you're busy. It can also help you beat boss battles, and provides periodic reminders to consume energy drinks. More information and a video can be found here. Google's data center on Mars If you have important data, you need a backup. That's why Google announced its first interplanetary data center, named "Ziggy Stardust," on the Google Cloud Platform Blog today. Located in the Gale Crater on Mars, it will store a cache of data from Earth to prevent irrecoverable loss when a planetary disaster strikes. Google hopes to finish the data center by 2018. LineageOS' mascot CyanogenMod's mascot, Cid, was one of the most recognizable icons in the Android community. As the spiritual successor to CyanogenMod, LineageOS has created its own mascot - 'Ink'. The project also announced 'Br0zip,' an artificial intelligence that can port LineageOS to any device in no time at all. Chromebook accessories Even though most Chromebooks can now run Android apps, you still can't use your Chromebook like an Android phone/tablet for all use cases. Until now, that is. Google has announced a Chromebook Groupie Stick (seen above), a Chromebook Cardboard headset, and a Chromebook armband. See the company's blog post for more info. Exynos Yoga Processor Remember when curved phones were a thing? Maybe we'll see more in the coming months, because Samsung has just unveiled the Exynos Yoga Processor - the first flexible mobile SoC. Anyone up for a Galaxy Flex? Carved screen protector Carved is a small Indiana-based phone case company, but now they are working on a wooden screen protector. Why hasn't this been done before? I'll take ten. I'm Feeling Woof/I'm Feeling Meow By force-touching the Google app icon in iOS, you can select "I'm Feeling Woof" or "I'm Feeling Meow." These give your pets access to the stuff they care about - from dog food to balls of yarn. More info can be found on Google's blog post. Waze maps for Mars According to the company's blog, Waze is has begun to map the surface of Mars. Certain members of the Waze community will also be sent to the Red Planet to more accurately map the surface. JerryRigEverything's NoPhone video If you haven't heard about it, the NoPhone is a solid piece of plastic designed to simulate the feeling of a phone in your pocket. I'm not really sure if anyone uses it, but JerryRigEverything is happy to break it just as much as any other phone. Google Translate for Heptapod B Using machine learning, Google Translate can now decrypt messages written in Heptapod B - the language from the film Arrival. On an unrelated note, it looks like someone from Google is still rocking a Nexus 10. See Google's blog post for more info. Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s ASUS has an April Fools gag too - the Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s Veritas Blue Limited Special Edition. I would probably buy this phone. MKBHD's Nokia 3310 review You may have heard about the updated Nokia 3310, but it turns out the original is an amazing smartphone. Okay, maybe not, but the video is pretty funny. Open GApps Femto Do you need to flash the latest Gapps package on your device, but you don't have a stable network connection? Not to worry, the Open GApps Femto package is here to help. It uses the United States HAARP service (which is not real, but just pretend) to download the latest GApps package. You can find more info at the GApps blog.   That concludes our coverage of April Fools' Day in the tech world. Let us know in the comments below which gag you liked the most!

Greg Abbott https://kodi.tv/ Sergio Carmona Scariest one... seriously... Artem Russakovskii Not even a 503 or something? Just a 200? Ballsy re: SEO. SickoPsycho oops- beat me to it. Yeah they actuqally had me going until I compared a whois of kodi.tv vs kickasstorrents.com, a site that actually was seized. The whois data would show that it is not official. Derik Taylor So this is one I find interesting. Could it technically be a criminal offense to falsify a domain seizure? How would that work? Greg Abbott Doubt it, technically a website isn't an official document. mondeca I hope every year that Google will announce something real and awesome on April Fools' Day, like they did with Gmail. Once again, I am disappointed. JG It isn't technically April Fools Day yet... Least not in the US...

BatJake Will Arnett sounds like Michael Keaton. Corbin Davenport And they both have played Batman. Peterson Silva "Frankly, I'm not sure if this is actually real or not" Well then THAT ought to be the best one! Trooper311 Gimme dat gnome yo. abqnm The Google Haptic Helpers was OK, until they applied the "I Voted!" sticker to the guy's shirt. I was laughing and crying at the same time. Corbin Davenport Yep, that had me laughing too. AdrianFDiratama . How about JG I'd actually like to see Google produce the Google Gnome.... All they'd need to do is add a battery (and Qi charging) to a Google Home and stick it in a new Gnome shell... Make sure its IP68 and maybe even MIL-STD-810G certified. It'd be a fun little gadget to put on the picnic table of your next summer back yard get together. Pump out some tunes, order pizza & Ubers for everyone to go home in, etc... Or take out when you work in the garden & don't want to get your phone dirty... Maybe even produce one with an LTE radio (and GPS). Then you could take it out of WiFi range camping. Wake up and find him chilling next to your tent in his little chair "Hey Google, how's today's weather? When does the rafting place open? How far away from the camp site is it?" cdotlawrence Maybe like a more customizable (from a looks standpoint), durable, & usable-on-go version of Home? Google Home Pro/Ultra? Interesting idea, but not sure why you wouldn't do most of the things it would do on your phone. Some specific use cases like you mentioned but beyond those, idk. Guess it'd be a highly functional, portable, durable and customizable speaker? Suicide_Note Ms. Pac-Man in Maps is live for me here in the US, even though it isn't April 1st yet. Daishi No Clarity Speaker??? Artem Russakovskii Why would that be in this post? Urmil Shroff What if we actually get the Mars data center many years from now? Eumelanin Knight I love this day. I just wish everyone kept up the pranks for the entire month like I do. Oddly enough.. I usually have less friends in May than I started with in April. How curious. Not sure why I brought that up.

Saying goodbye to Android Police and hello to Google Liam Spradlin Follow View All Posts 2017/03/20 1:19pm PDTMar 20, 2017 92 Plus 1 on G+ 737 Share on Facebook 65 Share on Twitter Total Shares894 Design Editorials Off-Topic Sometimes telling my own story is a challenge. So, after more than 5 years at AP, figuring out what to include in this post and how to write it hasn't been easy. But in the interest of eliminating suspense, I’ll give you the news up front: I'm joining Google as part of the Design Relations team! Android Police has been a big part of my life since I first started talking to Artem about contributing back in 2011. I won’t spell out the whole story here - if you want all the gory details I’ll tell you over coffee. But being part of the AP team has given me innumerable opportunities for new experiences, exploration, expression, and friendship. I’ll be sad to leave such a great team of writers, editors, and producers but I’m so excited to see what’s ahead of me at Google. This transition also means that I’ll be leaving some of my most beloved design projects including apps like Nova Launcher and Focus. If you’re a UIUX & motion designer with examples of your work in production, and you're interested in helping out with Nova, get in touch using this form! I’ve been so fortunate over the years to work (outside of my role at AP) with truly passionate and knowledgable developers like Jack, Kevin, and Francisco building great products and getting to know the users who are often just as passionate about Android as we are. And at touchlab I’ve been able to work on some amazing projects that touch millions more - from a brand new platform for delivering free gigabit WiFi to NYC to an open-source framework that enables precision medical research on Android. If you're interested in picking up where I'm leaving off at touchlab, check out the recruitment page here. If you're wondering what I'll be doing at Google, just check out Nick Butcher's post explaining what Google's Design Relations team does. Actually what I'll be doing as part of the team already comprises much of my work today. For me, part of the fun of being a designer in my position is being able to share design thinking, rationale, and resources with individuals and organizations so that - once we finish executing a great experience - they’re set up for future success. Design execution and conversation are two sides of the same coin for me, and I look forward to doing both side by side with other designers from my new position. Of course I’m not planning on disappearing - you’ll still see me on Google+ and Twitter, and I plan to continue (and ramp up) recording for Design Notes and streaming my design work to Twitch and YouTube whenever possible. And yes, I’ll be at I/O this year, too 😊 To Artem, David, Rita, Cam, Eric, Ron, Cody, everyone else I’ve worked with at AP, and you, dear reader, thanks for everything. I’ll see you around.

F4LL0U7 Seriously! Kyle Salewski I'm really excited to see you do amazing things there. mma173 In the meanwhile, he should try resolve their messaging apps puzzle :D Drakenoid Hate to disappoint, but I don't think that's what his role there portends. Winston Two-pane design for landscape apps too please. Please. abc The title is design relations, NOT design. I presume his job won't involve designing, but instead trying to do PR for Google's shitty designs. Liam Spradlin Check out the link I put in the post explaining what members of the Design Relations team do: https:[email protected] /google-️-️designers-c12b70627b2e No PR involved :) David Ruddock https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ab529556bb24bc28bb507d2f97f1f02da8fa2d10281ea8adae03f2625c14cc50.gif Leonardo Baez look at the bright side.... now you have an insider in google.... wink wink Pankaj Ramnani Hahaha solid, but then it'll be too obvious when they say *our sources at Google tell us...* 😂 PVL_93_RU Implying the entire AP team wasn't one before ;) Zeek Loving the Mean Girls reference here :D Pan Szym Good luck! 4Ui812 Congratulations Francisco Franco It's been a tremendous joy to be able to work with you on several amazing projects. We delivered great apps, presented together in several conferences and I have the pleasure to call you a real life friend. Your drive & professionalism will largely enhance the Design Relations Team and I cannot wait to have lunch with you at NYC's Google HQ. 🖕 remister Classy with the one finger salute.... Liam Spradlin That's our standard greeting to each other 😸 Liam Spradlin Thanks Franco 🙂 I think we've done some really amazing stuff together. I'll have some middle fingers waiting for you in Hangouts 😛 EcE Congratulations! Well deserved! Artem Russakovskii You mean Allo. 3825 Pretty sure they used to use hangouts internally? Did that change? Nick Yarosz Or Hangout Chats VAVAMk_2 Love your kernel, Franco! makapav Wait...Francisco - did you join Google too? exadeci Or maybe he plans on abusing the perks of having a friend working at Google :D Lars Jeppesen No he loves Safari and his iPhone too much Francisco Franco I do? Francisco Franco Nope, but I want to visit the NYC HQ and have lunch in their amazing canteen once more (had lunch in Mountain View and London's HQ). makapav You and me bro...you and me.. ;-) Good luck!

I just knew it. David Ruddock oh yeah definitely that's how we get it all, busted /s Jeff Beck Dang it Liam. I told you to be subtle! Artem Russakovskii More tonight at 11pm on Fox. ED-Zが現れた! Congrats Liam! Have a long a prosper career at Google! Richard Gao y u do dis Liam Willie D Why do bloggers feel the need to publicly announce they're leaving...a blog? You're joining a tech force, to become just one more techie in the region that no one wants around them, let alone wants to hear about it. Resentment, hell yeah. Good luck. David Ruddock Here's an idea: Shutup. marcusmarcus2 Why do whiners feel the need to publicly whine? No one wants to hear about it. Adam Thomas Go complain somewhere else. Nobody cares. MJ Why wouldn't he? AP Is more than a blog but a community where the AP staff interacts with users on a daily basis. How miserable is your life exactly to leave a comment like that? Maybe a cry for help? Carson Saldanha https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7d1b6e0c14167e425421de8548de71eabb22ec6885f23c216f0ed8e8f98c3808.png EDIT: 24 now Avishek now it is 77 marcusmarcus2 Now he has 82. And look, you have a whopping 1 down vote. Hmm I wonder who that could have been. *cough Willie *cough NinoBr0wn The worst thing the internet ever did was give everyone a voice. Isn't that ironic. Dominic81 Wow help them fix Allo and their Messaging apps fiasco :P Congrats Chris Mckechnie Congratulations Liam I'm sure you'll do great things with Google Cody Toombs Liam thinks he's finally escaping, but I've secretly placed a mind control device in his Google Home unit and it will subtly brainwash him back to us one day.

We're going to miss your input here, but best of luck to you! I'm sure this will be a great opportunity, and I'm glad you got the chance to take it Maxr1998 Yes, this so much. Thought for a moment that AP finally admitted they're Google fanboys ;) /s (and oh, there'd nothing be wrong about that, I consider myself as one) Nope.jpeg So much for the hype around the potential of a new messaging app for Android snobs by Google. #badpun instinct I thought it was going to be re-branded as "Google Police" as well. makapav This exactly what my fear was when I read that headline in Feedly. I thought AP was shutting down and bought by Google to control the press and media for calling them out on continuously. sabrinal1979 I hope this doesn't mean that you can't appear on TWiT anymore. All About Android... coldcc So nova might be left to die? tim242 Ummm no. The founder/creator of Nova is very commited to its success. Liam Spradlin Not at all! Kevin is a brilliant developer, and we're recruiting a new designer to keep the UIUX moving forward! Wayne Randall So long, and thanks for all the fish. Hilman in Edmonton Good luck Liam!!!

I know you will say NO but YES it is. :) Artem Russakovskii OK, fine, yes, it is. (No, it's not.) Richard Gao Did you know that if you scramble all the letters in 'Artem Russakovskii,' add a few letters, and then delete a few, you get 'I am secretly a Googler'? Little-known fact. HSidhu you just said above that IT IS :P so folks Artem agrees that he is Googler too :) mike shwilly Dem Pixel2 leaks are gonna flood LoadGamePL APK PLZ ScottColbert You've been my favorite writer, and will be missed. Much luck to you at Google! Good_Ole_Pinocchio Who the heck is Liam? 🤔 Carson Saldanha L. Carson Saldanha Will miss seeing you on the podcast ;) Stone Cold Congratulations Liam netizen Good luck! roberto.elena So, Android Police has finally planted a mole inside Google. About time! VAVAMk_2 They already had one...how do you think they get so many Nexus/Pixel leaks? XerBlade Does this mean I won't get to listen to you lovingly embrace your Pixel C on any podcasts anymore? https://media.giphy.com/media/10bWKNvq4iifQs/giphy.gif Liam Spradlin I can send out the occasional tweet to remind everyone of the Pixel C's perfection 😛 Eric Ravenscraft Nobody I know deserves this more than you do, Liam.

Or at least "Mod" or something like that. Artem Russakovskii It's a Disqus issue - perhaps limited to mobile. I've always had the staff badge. Carson Saldanha No, I was on desktop and it wasn't showing. I scrolled down and saw the others having the badges. Patrik Carlsson Maybe he's policing in civil duty? ;) makapav I'm reposting this here from my reply to Liam elsewhere so you see it Artem: "...what my fear was when I read that headline in Feedly. I thought AP was shutting down and bought by Google to control the press and media for calling them out continuously." :-D Robin Damn, that's sad to hear 🙄. Really going to miss you on the podcast as well as your posts. Also sad that you won't design for Nova etc. anymore. You're definitely my favorite Android UIUX designer (if there is such a thing 😇). All the best for you and your work at Google 👍 Liam Spradlin Thank you 🙂 Patrick Smithopolis Does this mean you're going to leak information to AP about the upcoming Pixel devices? Liam Spradlin It absolutely does not mean that. JG Of course not... ::wink wink, nudge nudge:: Peter https://media.giphy.com/media/d5t6bqFD3c5nG/giphy.gif Sam Del Valle Go make Material great again Liam We love you and we'll miss you.

You will be sorely missed, Liam. I'm sure you'll do amazing things at Google! linkember Rita promise me that you will never leave. Rita El Khoury I'm sure Artem would kill me before I do. makapav That's very reassuring...phew! I guess good-guy Artem? Adam Margeson I believe that would be considered a form of leaving. In fact, some people call that the easy way out. Liam Spradlin Thank you Rita 💛🤗 Luckbuckets Hair today, Gone tomorrow. Thanks for all your great writing and work! Good luck at Google!

Finer You will be sorely missed, Liam. Best of luck for your journey with Google - Bon voyage! wuafri Awesome man ! Congrats ! Ian Steven Good. Thanks for all your tremendous work here at AP, especially your very sensitive and eye for design, detail and sensibility on UX. I hope you really help Google and you don't hesitate to bring your own rationale to their design discussions since after Matias left on Google, ther design inconsistencies began to flourish again. But still Material design is still the best. Here's one of the few issues I noticed and would love for you to give it a read ONE LAST TIME and input it directly to Google: 1. The forced circle Pixel launcher app icons/on Watch 2.0 too 2. The swipe app drawer on Pixel launcher isn't Material design enough 3. The oblong searchbar on Pixel Launcher 4. The circle group icons on Pixel Launcher. 5. Everything is wrong about Pixel Launcher 6. Please save Now Launcher 7. The Google Play brand and other cobrand/services app icons. Please tell them to bring back the old one 8. The card radius inconsistencies in Material design, some Google app/services even is using a 3pt and up card radius on app. IT SHOULD BE ALWAYS 2PT 9. The Google Assistant/Home/Search/Now voice interaction inconsistencies and lack of streamline. 10. The horrendous and doesn't make any sense brand logo of Google Assistant 11. The UI of Google Assistant Kamran Mackey 0 of those things are going to be corrected, as there's nothing to correct in terms of what you have listed. Especially the Google Play thing. Android Market is NEVER returning. Ian Steven 🙄 Don't act dumb like you didn't understand anything I've said. You know I'm talking about the redesigned app icons of Google Play and it's cobrands and services. Man up and stop trollin MrcheGuev Wel Liam , imma tell it to you in my own mother's tongue : Bon vent ! And congrats :D MZone When I saw the title I thought Google acquired AP! and thought 'Damn, we've lost the best of them', anyways all the best Liam! Do leak info every now and then to AP though! PVL_93_RU I can't even begin to think of anybody else who'd be deserving of this appointement (I always knew it'd be Liam one day).

Recently the seemingly unstoppable digital behemoths of Google and Facebook have been at least temporarily derailed by the wrong kind of attention. First we had Facebook being unmasked as the world’s largest repository for made-up stories and “fake news”, and now we have Google fighting a rearguard action over apparently putting advertising from respectable companies alongside deranged hate speech videos on YouTube. Advertisers, including the Guardian and the British government, have been withdrawing from Google’s digital ad exchange after discovering their ads alongside videos for, among other things, American white supremacists and violent extremists. At the risk of biting the hand that feeds, one could speculate that those inclined to watch violent jihadist videos or the Ku Klux Klan’s hate speech might benefit from exposure to messages from the peace-loving Guardian, or London Transport, or indeed government appeals to give blood in a more medically approved manner. However, the lack of “brand safety” online that allows advertising to appear on the channels and videos of the criminally racist and violent can no longer be ignored. Are we finally reacting to the disruptive supremacy of Facebook and Google? | Will Hutton Read more Just as with Facebook’s fake news phenomenon, the problem has been hidden in plain sight for a long time. But until now, the platforms, the advertisers and the public have either not noticed or not cared. It is disingenuous of everyone involved to suggest they did not know that this was a possible outcome. The fact that Google is only now giving advertisers a list of every channel their advertising appears against is surprising; did nobody ask before? The genesis and unfolding of these crises goes to the heart of how we define the companies that are the new gatekeepers to our news, entertainment and other information. Sir Martin Sorrell, chairman of the world’s largest advertising agency, WPP, put it like this: “We have always said Google, Facebook and others are media companies and have the same responsibilities as any other media company ... They cannot masquerade as technology companies, particularly when they place advertisements.” It could equally be argued that they are not “masquerading” as technology companies. They are, after all, stuffed to the primary-coloured rafters with the world’s finest technologists, and they do really believe themselves to be “technology” companies. But it’s hard to deny that they are also publishers. Social platforms including Google, Facebook, Snapchat and Twitter monetise, host, distribute, produce and even in some cases commission material. By acting like technology companies, while in fact taking on the role of publishers, Google, Facebook and others, have accidentally designed a system that elevates the cheapest and “most engaging” content at the expense of more expensive but less “spreadable” material. Anyone who wants to reach a million people with a poorly produced conspiracy theory video is in luck. If, however, you want to run a well-resourced newsroom covering a town of 200,000 people, that is not going to be sustainable. It is the height of irony that the currency of social media, “likes” and “shares”, often directly correlate to how aggressive or sensational a piece is. A weaponised populist media, which no longer even has to pick up a phone to sell advertising, has been freed to be as extreme as it wishes. As the American rightwing troll and media personality Mike Cernovich perceptively tweeted: “Conflict is attention, and attention is influence.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest The newsroom of the New York Times: the newspapers posts 1,600 items a week on social media. Photograph: Jonathan Torgovnik/Getty Images Who pays for reporters to fill the social media feeds? In a new report I co-authored with the Canadian academic Taylor Owen, The Platform Press: How Silicon Valley reengineered journalism, we see the systemic problems of scale and automation without human editing as a central threat to producing high-quality news and information. Dozens of interviews and extensive analysis support the proposition that whatever the business model of media companies, the relationship with platform companies is critical to their health. Large news organisations such as CNN put out well over 2,000 items a week on to social platforms, meanwhile newspaper publisher the New York Times and digital native Huffington Post are not far behind with around 1,600 pieces a week each. Even if a publisher limits social distribution to the main platforms – Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and Snapchat – there is nevertheless a significant investment in time and energy making slightly different versions of each story work on each platform. This makes the terrain almost impossible for smaller organisations that do not have wealthy audiences, unless they operate under the protection of a non-profit funding structure. Nicco Mele, director of Harvard’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy and a former publisher of the LA Times, identifies it as primarily an economic issue. “This is a crisis – in the next five years print ads are going away. This is a real scenario (for local American journalism); no jobs and no reporters,” Mele told a packed event in San Francisco last week that discussed the balance of power between journalism and technology companies. At the same event, Clara Jeffery, editor-in-chief of Mother Jones, laid out the costs of an award-winning investigation into private prisons: “It cost us $350,000, and we saw maybe $5,000 back on that in terms of advertising.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos: his purchase of the Washington Post has been a spectacular success. Photograph: Joe Klamar/AFP/Getty Images Journalism’s striking parallels with the financial crash Both the fake news concerns over at Facebook and the advertising drama at Google are symptomatic of a wider issue, namely that we have a news environment that is impenetrable and incomprehensible to all but a few. Just as 2008 saw a crisis in the financial markets, 2016 saw a similar crisis in the public information market. The parallels are striking: shoddy mis-sold products circulated at high speed through automatic trading systems beyond the control of even those who designed them. Like Goldman Sachs, Facebook and Google are too big to fail, but unlike most investment banks, the political developments of the past six months have galvanised a more ideological response from the top of the companies. Visiting San Francisco last week, there was a mood among both local publishers and technology companies that the shock of the US election had provided a mandate for journalists – and a sobering opportunity for self-examination for the masters of the digital universe. At the same San Francisco journalism event, Jay Hamilton, director of Stanford University’s journalism programme, noted that because of the ownership structure of Facebook and Google, the founders do not have to maximise profitability for shareholders. They retain control of the companies and could therefore decide to prioritise the support of high-quality journalism. Joaquin Alvarado, chief executive of the Center for Investigative Reporting, noted that the local reporting crisis in America was relatively inexpensive to ameliorate: “It’s not a$1tn problem to put reporters in every state house, it is a $100m problem.” While it is not ideal that independent journalism is slowly being subsumed into a structure of great power, it is encouraging that the controllers of the key companies at least pay lip service to the idea of supporting high-quality reporting. The tech billionaires who have put most into journalism directly are Pierre Omidyar, founder of eBay, whose First Look Media supports both filmmaking and reporting, and the Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos, whose $250m purchase of the Washington Post has, so far, proved to be a spectacular success. When Bezos bought the paper in 2013 it was initially seen as a blow, as the paper’s revered proprietor, Don Graham, said the family company could not make the investments to make it flourish. Four years later both Bezos’s investment and his own personal attention to the technological health of the Post are helping the paper enjoy a renaissance. For a long time, Silicon Valley companies rejected the notion that they were more than vectors for traffic to publisher sites. Fake news and the inappropriate advertising debacle has robbed them of any plausible deniability that they are media organisations. How they meet their new responsibilities will be fascinating to watch.

(World Wide Hearing) Related Stories Surgical implant in brain stem allows Montreal boy to hear Teen's groundbreaking hearing aid implant surgery 'didn't hurt' and took minutes Sudbury family wants your votes for Cochlear Celebration video A Montreal-based non-profit has been awarded a $750,000 grant from Google to help children with hearing loss around the world. World Wide Hearing (WWH) is one five winners of the Google.org Impact Challenge and the only non-profit from Quebec to make the finals. "This is extraordinary because it takes our organization to a whole new level and it's going to connect a lot of children isolated by hearing loss to the world," Executive Director of World Wide Hearing Audra Renyi told CBC Montreal's Homerun. Hearing-impaired teen is 1st North American to undergo groundbreaking surgery Part of the criteria for winning the grant is using technology to help solve social issues, something that WWH intends to do using teleaudiology. The cloud-based, open-access platform will start by connecting 150,000 children — but eventually millions — from isolated communities that desperately need access to audiologists, speech therapists and rehabilitation. Goal is to equalize care The idea is to accelerate this kind of care in developing or middle income countries. "This platform really equalizes access to hearing care and makes distance disappear," said Renyi. The initiatives out of WWH are deeper than the teleaudiology project, and start with the community. In countries where WWH has worked, like the Philippines, Honduras or India, the focus is to train local people as hearing aid technicians. CBC's The Current launches pilot project for deaf, hearing-impaired audiences This not only ensures more long term care beyond screening, providing hearing aids and  rehabilitation, but also fighting social stigma. "In a lot of countries it's considered a curse from God to have a child with a disability," said Renyi, who added parents may hide their child at home or keep them out of school. "I've seen cases where sometimes the principal or the teachers are kicking [the child] out of school because they're just not hearing them. Really it's a social isolation," Renyi said. World Wide Hearing spent time working with children in Guatemala. (World Wide Hearing) The problem also hits close to home. In Nunavut, there is only one audiologist yet Inuit children have some of the highest rates of hearing loss in the world. The rate of hearing loss for children in the territory is 30 per cent, compared to three per cent in southern Canada, Renyi said. A predisposition to ear infections in the population could be part of the problem. Environmental factors — such as overcrowding in homes, poor nutrition or hygiene — can exacerbate the infection and lead to permanent hearing loss. Deaf Montreal boy gains hearing after experimental surgery With only one audiologist in the territory, WWH focuses on training mostly Inuit women in the communities to provide follow up care when the audiologist is not available. "We're very excited about the potential to also help a lot of Canadians here," said Renyi.

As a result, users can learn all they need to know in this Android Nougat vs Android 6.0 Marshmallow walkthrough and comparison. This is a detailed list of Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow vs Android 7 Nougat on the Nexus 6P. Here we will detail some of the new features and improvements Google has made in Android Nougat, 7.1 and now the Android 7.1.2 Nougat release. There are over 50 changes, but only a few are visual. Many behind the scenes tweaks will make a big difference for Samsung, HTC and LG smartphone owners. Among others. Read: How to Fix Bad Nexus Android Nougat Battery Life Google’s Android 6.0 Marshmallow update was released in October 2015 after a long beta period, and Android 7.0 Nougat was released on August 22nd. It adds multiple impressive features and improves on the overall design. Additionally, Android 7.1.1 was released on December 5th, followed by a beta of 7.1.2 in January. As 2017 continues more and more manufacturers have started to release updates. Android 7.0 Nougat first debuted back on March 9th at Google IO. Earlier than prior years in an effort to release it faster than ever before. The beta previews allowed for faster development, more bug fixes and the earlier release we’ve seen in quite a while. Alternatively, those same betas were done by Samsung, LG and many other companies looking to fast-track software updates. The LG G5 is getting Android 7.0 right now on multiple carriers, if it didn’t get it back in December. Moto Z & G users have the latest release and so do HTC smartphones. Now that we’re in February of 2017 the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge Android Nougat is rolling out to millions of phones. All of those owners will want to know what to expect. If so, read on for our comparison. Read: 95 Best Android Apps & Games Now that many Nexus and Pixel phones are on Android 7.1.1, others are up next. Although all the other updates arriving right now are Android 7.0 and not 7.1.1 Nougat. Once the initial update arrives, smaller releases and patches will follow. Expect carriers and manufacturers to continue working hard on updates as 2017 continues. Then, we’ll start getting Android 7.1.2 later this year or in the summer. For now though, almost all major smartphones released in 2016 are running Android 7.0 Nougat, or are getting updates as we speak or the coming days and weeks. Which is why the information below will be so helpful. Android 7.0 or Android 7.1 Nougat is a free software update for all smartphones and tablets that can support it. After the beta period we expected updates to arrive faster this time around, but that hasn’t been the case. Many did get it within three months, but major players like Samsung still took longer than expected. However, now that we’re halfway into February almost all carriers are sending multiple Nougat updates out to select devices. That’s good news. What’s New in Android Nougat Currently the Android 7.1.2 Nougat release is only available for the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus Player and the Pixel C tablet. As well as the Pixel phones. Three missing from that list are: the Nexus 5, Nexus 7 (2013) and the Nexus 10. We’ve recently learned the Nexus 5 won’t officially get the update to Android 7.0 at all. At least not from Google. Then, the Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 received 7.1.1 but won’t get 7.1.2 Nougat. All other non-Google phones are getting the initial release from August of 2016. Additionally, Android 7.1 is available on the Google Pixel, Nexus 5x, Nexus 6P and Pixel C. Other devices on Nougat are running Android 7.0 and not Google’s latest maintenance update. Some of the most noteworthy new features are split-screen multitasking and multi-window mode. This works great and supports all apps, not just select few like we see on Samsung or LG devices. Another huge addition to N is Android Instant Apps, which we’re starting to see go live recently. This enables Android to install small bits of an app ( from a search result or web link) and allow one-time instant app usage. No installing an app and starting over. Android just adds what it needs for that moment, uses the app, and you’re done. It discards it once finished. Other changes include improved battery life again with a more efficient “Doze” on-the-go mode, seamless updates that happen behind the scenes (if enabled), a completely revamped notifications and settings menu that’s smarter, more detailed and enhanced. We also like the new round icons, space saver, and app icon shortcuts. Not to mention direct reply from notification bar for all apps, bunched notifications for a cleaner look, number blocking and call screening, improved Quick Setting tiles (and customization) and more. Meaning, there is a lot to see. We’ll be adding more to our list as we dig through each release. Many of these won’t be seen in the update on Samsung or Motorola phones though, as they slightly change the interface to their preference. Comparison You can click on any of the images below to instantly jump to that image in the slideshow and see how that part of the OS compares to previous versions. It’s worth noting the older Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow will always be on the left if needed. Android 7.0 Nougat or 7.1.1 is on the right or by itself. We’ll update with more details as they become available. Many of these changes are included on the Galaxy Nougat update, and others, but look different. Just keep that in mind as you explore the new software release. Enjoy all it has to offer, and drop us a comment below with any questions or concerns. Multi-window Support   1 / 27 With Android N Google has finally delivered multi-window support. Essentially allowing two apps to run on the screen simultaneously. This works on both tablets and smartphones, and appears to work across all apps. We saw this in Android M previews, but it never made it to the final version. However, in Android N this is a highlight feature that's getting a lot of attention. Multi-window support works by tapping the square recent apps menu, then sliding any app to the top. Instantly users can run two apps at once, resize each screen as they see fit, and better multi-task on Android. This will be a very welcomed edition for Android tablet users, app developers and more. Google also states this will allow "Picture-in-Picture" mode for Android TV, which is awesome. Being able to watch TV while browse Netflix at the same time.   1 / 27 22 Responses 03/10/2016 Angelatphoenix Reply Cool inonce…!m­­­­­­­­­y f­­­­­­­­­r­­­­­­­­­i­­­­­­­­­e­­­­­­­­­n­­­­­­­­­d’s s­­­­­­­­­t­­­­­­­­­e­­­­­­­­­p-s­­­­­­­­­i­­­­­­­­­s­­­­­­­­­t­­­­­­­­­e­­­­­­­­­r m­­­­­­­­­a­­­­­­­­­k­­­­­­­­­e­­­­­­­­­s $85 /h­­­­­­­­­r o­­­­­­­­­n t­­­­­­­­­he co­­­­­­­­­mpu­­­­­­­­­ter .

I think Google are running out of ideas and just simply moving the UI around mostly to try and ‘wow’ people. Perhaps they should spend time sorting out their app store to better suit tablets and large screens rather than just pumping out new android versions for the sake of it. 03/16/2016 Cory Gunther Reply Um…. what do you think split screen and improved multi-tasking is for.. tablets. It makes the experience so much better. I’m using Android N on the Pixel C and it’s actually very impressive. And if you saw other coverage, the multi-window mode is far more advanced than Samsung’s, and others. 08/22/2016 Gag Reply Smartphone OS changes come subtly.

Say around the 34-35th of each month if user are getting close to running out of data.” What kind of calendar are you using?

If you know any teenagers or young adults, they’ve probably heard of PewDiePie and may not know or care about the venerable old WSJ. PewDiePie is a YouTube star, actually THE YouTube star. He has 54.5m subscribers (at the time of writing, it’ll be a few hundred thousand more by the time I publish). His videos usually hit 3m views within 24 hours of upload. His three highest viewed videos have 64m, 50m and 47m views. He puts out more than a video a day most weeks. The vast majority of his videos are him playing video games and giving a commentary. PewDiePie receives millions of dollars per year (estimates vary) as his share in the advertising revenue that Google collects each time one of his videos is played. The Wall Street Journal (according to the latest figures I could find from 2014) has a daily circulation of 2.3 million. It’s certainly possible that PewDiePie acting alone (but with the resources he uses on Google’s YouTube) has built a larger global audience in seven years than the Wall Street Journal’s thousands of staff have built in over a century. And PewDiePie’s audience and reach is growing, the WSJ is probably shrinking. The short version of the story is that three WSJ reporters watched two years worth of his videos and claimed to have found evidence of antisemitism in PewDiePie’s videos. They contacted Disney and YouTube’s Red Programme (a sponsorship deal for huge YouTube stars) who both publicly distanced themselves from PewDiePie and cancelled contracts costing him millions of dollars. The allegations against PewDiePie are completely ridiculous, if you want to learn more you can watch some of the videos I link to in these tweets. If you want just one 4 min video this Rebel Media is the one (language warning): In Defense of PewDiePie: #PewDiePieDidNothingWrong. Mass de-monetisation by YouTube The next data point is my personal experience with YouTube. I haven’t built a massive YouTube channel. I have some videos that have been successful and a year ago or so I turned on the monetization feature. For a channel like mine, with 1,500 subscribers and a few videos that are consistently popular this amounts to $20 a month. However even this is constantly at risk. Each video I upload, no matter what the content or the description, is automatically flagged as controversial. I must immediately ask for a manual review in order that it may be “monetised”. With most of my videos this happens 24 hours later. That has the side effect of reducing any financial benefit I may get for the initial spike in views after any upload. The reason for this is that the big brands that buy advertising on YouTube have been made incredibly nervous about the types of content their brands may be appearing alongside. Johnson and Johnson don’t want hand cream adverts appearing next to ISIS beheading videos and nobody wants any product Immediately de-monetised on first upload … appearing alongside Nazi imagery and antisemitic memes. In many ways allowing anyone to use YouTube is like having the broadcast network of the BBC, CNN, ABC, NBC and CBS all working for you without having made the massive financial investment in infrastructure. The internet has, in the course of 20 years, turned a century of investment in distribution systems into a sharply declining asset. When Ebola was sweeping north Africa even the BBC, who once had a global broadcast system, turned to What’sApp messages to spread health news in … only to be approved a little while later French and English! All those years of building and maintaining radio broadcast equipment is turning to dust, replaced by bits and bytes on a common global internet. Of course old media is threatened. That’s why Disney was sponsoring PewDiePie. My kids, while too young for PewDiePie, are much more knowledgable about the age appropriate YouTubers they follow than the latest Disney characters. And this scares the living daylights out of advertising dependent, legacy media who know their investment in their media brands and distribution systems is being devalued faster than anyone could have predicted 20 years ago. There are currently anti-free speech campaigns against videos which criticise third wave feminism and a number of other subjects. Anything marked as “controversial” is being de-monetised on YouTube. For sure nobody wants their products associated with Jew hatred or ISIS beheading videos, but what control should big brands have over the material they advertise alongside when it comes to amateur and semi-amateur generated content on blogs, YouTube and other self publishing platforms? The relevance for those of us talking positively about Israel and rebutting endless lies and slanders against the Jewish people is that our entire subject area is already considered “controversial”. What are the practical implications? YouTube channels that talk about Israel or rebut hate speech against Jews (like Palestine Media Watch or MEMRI) are at risk of being taken down. Already my own channel is very hard to place advertising alongside: this was never a huge money spinner but removing any access to financial compensation for the huge work I put in does put a damper on creating new material. Eventually this will extend to the Google Adverts that appear on sites like this one. That is a serious problem. The darker future is that this goes beyond advertising and pressure is brought down on those who host “controversial” material or the social networks that help many of us spread our work. That’s not just an indirect attack on an ability to raise funds, that would be the shutting down of speech. This is already common on Facebook and Twitter, both with crowd reporting systems that allow Social Justice Warriors and other far left devotees of Saul Alinsky to attempt to shut out arguments and ideas they have no answer for. Finally, if you’re still interested in this subject, I’m embedding just one video here. It’s a fantastic overview of all this and goes into some more detail. Support more stories like this.

Image Credit: Google On a cold morning in February 2015, a group of men left the spacious Google X headquarters in Mountain View, California, before daybreak. They traveled more than two hours east to some trailers parked in the middle of nowhere, on private ranch lands in California’s Central Valley. The men were there to test experimental drones for Google’s celebrated research-and-development group, known as Google X (the group now calls itself simply “X”). The work was grueling and involved 10- to 12-hour days of physically demanding labor in the extreme temperatures of the Central Valley, outside the town of Merced. The men had complained to their supervisors about the hours in these conditions, but they felt their requests were largely ignored. And on this day, their complaints turned into terror. One of their team members, a man in his mid-50s, collapsed on the job. He fell to the ground and jerked violently, as if he was crawling. The incident was caught on the field video. Miles from anywhere, his coworkers called an ambulance and drove as fast as they could to meet it en route. He was taken to a local hospital and held overnight. Some people at Google X say he had a heart attack. Others say it was a grand mal seizure. Word of the incident spread throughout the company, with rumors swirling that it had been caused by exhaustion and stress, multiple sources told Business Insider. While the man’s health recovered, his job at Google did not. After taking a couple of months’ leave, he requested a transfer to a less physically demanding role within the team or elsewhere at Google X. Instead, he was sent back out into the field, essentially demoted, sources say, and eventually pushed out of the company. We have changed the name of the person who experienced this medical emergency to “Joe,” because he declined to give us a statement and requested that Business Insider not publish his name. But half a dozen people familiar with this incident shared details, including photos and emails, with Business Insider. Some members of the Project Wing field team painted an alarming picture of hostile work conditions driven by engineers and managers back at headquarters who scheduled the group to conduct loads of tests, thereby producing loads of data, despite the long hours outdoors that such a schedule required. What’s more, the field crew found much of their feedback and expertise on how to improve their circumstances discounted or ignored, in part, some say, because their backgrounds in the military were allegedly viewed disdainfully by others on their team. “It was unconscionable” to make that team “work that hard,” one person told us about this team’s experiences. The story of the drone crew reveals some of the problems that have plagued Google’s efforts to build advanced delivery drones, and it illustrates one of the risks when Silicon Valley’s worship of workaholism and data crash into real people doing physically demanding jobs. It’s a dangerous dynamic as companies like Google, Facebook, and cash-rich startups expand into new industries, from aerospace and delivery to space exploration and self-driving cars. It also comes at a time when the work conditions and cultures across America’s tech companies are under scrutiny, in the wake of sexual-harassment allegations at Uber. “It’s just not right in Silicon Valley,” one person told us. The Valley is grappling with its reputation for being a “bro” culture dominated by entitled, young men with degrees from prestigious universities. It’s a mentality that can result in exclusion and the victimization of a broad swath of people, from women and minorities to older men and even veterans. “This was super wrong. Those folks were harassed in an incorrect manner,” one person said of the Project Wing flight testers. “Those people, the ex-US military folks, their team discriminated against them very bluntly.” A hot Google X project hits turbulence For about five months, Joe had been a flight test engineer for Project Wing. The Wing team was developing a delivery drone, racing against Amazon and drone makers like DJI to invent what could become a massive new market, delivering everything from food to medicine to consumers’ doorsteps. The team had some successful and highly publicized tests in Australia the year before, and got the attention of Google cofounder Sergey Brin. Brin even “moved a desk into the bull pen of Project Wing where everyone works,” one person said. Google X was his brainchild and he often kept tabs on its projects. But things weren’t going so well. Above: Google Project Wing drone-delivery project. Image Credit: Google The Project Wing drone was based on a single-wing design that took off and landed upright, like a helicopter. But the drone kept toppling over on its nose. To solve the design problems, the flight-testing crew’s supervisor, Tony Nannini, wanted to do what Google managers often do in such situations: Collect loads of data. Nannini — who worked in the corporate offices in Mountain View, California, not in the field — crafted a schedule for “thousands of tests,” one person told us. For Joe and the rest of the flight-test crew, that meant 10- to 12-hour days outdoors flying the drones, sometimes in freezing temperatures or while standing in fields of two-inch-deep mud and cow excrement or, at other times, dealing with the Central Valley’s infamous 100-plus-degree heat. While Joe was the only person we know of to be hospitalized, other people also complained of exhaustion and of difficulty working in the harsh conditions, particularly the heat, according to documents viewed by Business Insider. Although the worksite included an air-conditioned trailer for the crew, the work of flying drones required spending long periods outside, sources said. The crew also complained that the work schedule was so demanding, with days spent away from home, it left them little time or energy for a home life. And while they were able to take advantage of some of Google’s perks (one person mentioned Google’s free drop-off/pick-up laundry service), they were unable to enjoy most of the benefits their coworkers had, such as social gatherings, lectures, and the like. Military people and the way they think Several people we spoke with said that Joe and the flight-testing crew at Project Wing seemed to be treated poorly in part because they were labeled ex-military. Joe was not actually a veteran but had worked as a civilian for the military, people told us. The team included several other retired and former military folks. There were conflicts between the flight-testing crew and their immediate supervisor, Nannini, as well as the head of the project at the time, Dave Vos, according to emails shared with Business Insider. From the testers’ point of view, they had loads of experience with sophisticated aircraft. They wanted clear rules, better safety protocols, and reasonable work expectations from the Project Wing managers. At the same time, some members of the flight-testing crew felt like their expertise on how to accomplish their mission was being dismissed, people told us. In contrast, some of the team’s managers felt as if the crew’s skills with combat airplanes and military drones made them somewhat overqualified and their ideas overkill for the task at hand, according to a person close to the company. Above: Project Wing drone pilots. Image Credit: Google/YouTube/Project Wing It was a disconnect between two groups with very different mentalities about how to get things done. Tension arose. A project manager from headquarters allegedly made a disparaging comment to the crew about military people and their ability to think independently. The crew members accused Nannini of condoning such attitudes. Team members complained about the alleged antimilitary attitude to a top manager and then, later, to the Google X human-resources representative, Chelsea Bailey. Emails reviewed by Business Insider, sent by two separate team members to Google HR, cite a perception of bias against veterans. Others went to HR over everything from project management to the hours required, to safety and general working conditions, according to emails seen by Business Insider. When Google X conducted its annual employee-satisfaction survey, internally called “Alphageist,” the flight-test team gave Nannini very low ratings. He gave them low employee-performance ratings, too, multiple people told us. The low employee-performance ratings meant that they wouldn’t qualify to be transferred to other jobs within Google, we understand. This was particularly hard on Joe, people said. “They were asking him to work 80-90 hour weeks outside in the middle of California in 110 degrees. He had a heart attack and then they let him go on temporary medical leave,” one person said regarding Joe. “Then his manager, the key source of a lot of those anti-veteran allegations, just completely downplayed him and constantly took retribution on him.” Nannini did not respond to our request for comment. But Google X spokeswoman Courtney Hohne defended Nanini’s management tactics, saying, “Just because a manager doesn’t accept someone’s idea or recommendation doesn’t mean they’re dismissive of this person’s professional skills or background. Ultimately a manager’s job, particularly when testing technologies that are unlike those that have come before, is to sift through a variety of possibilities and chart the most promising path. “Like other good people managers at X, Tony has worked hard to build a team of people with diverse backgrounds and perspectives,” Hohne said. The person no one blamed Some people blamed Bailey, saying, “That HR person was so inadequate in handling the case. Her job is to protect management the whole time.” Hohne denied that, saying that Google X has a separate workplace-investigation team that operates completely independently, and that the company has confidential hotlines and advisory groups for employees to turn to. The one person no one blamed was Brin, the Google cofounder back at X headquarters. Above: Google cofounder and Google X founder Sergey Brin. Image Credit: AP/Tony Avelar While everyone on the Wing team chatted with Brin (and described him as a “nice guy” filled with ideas on how to solve technical challenges), they didn’t lodge their complaints to him, considering him to be too far above their boss’s head to go to for such matters. “He wasn’t involved in day-to-day and maybe he couldn’t see the angst on everybody’s faces,” one person told us about Brin. “He was there so much, I don’t know how he couldn’t have heard, but he could be so above it all, it never floated to his attention.” Hohne also denied that work conditions for Project Wing field people were harsh and said that employees were “empowered” to take breaks. “The Wing site has an air-conditioned trailer with plenty of snacks and drinks, so our team can get the rest and shade they need. We also monitor working hours and conditions, and we adjust our testing schedules accordingly,” Hohne said. “Given that our moonshots take 5-10 years to come into the world, we set up our teams to think of their work as marathons rather than sprints, and encourage them to pace themselves and take breaks to step back, reassess, and make improvements and adjustments. We empower our field teams to exercise their judgment about what’s best to do when they encounter challenging working conditions and locations.” Back at work, and demoted After he collapsed, Joe took a couple of months of state-paid disability leave and then got the doctor’s OK to return to work. He asked to be transferred to another, less physical team on Project Wing or within Google X. He was an electrical engineer, in addition to being a pilot, drone pilot, and flight-test engineer, with decades of experience, sources said. But he was told no other positions were available for him, people told us. Instead, Joe was demoted from flight-test engineer to a “ground operator” job with the field crew. Because of the medical incident, his pilot’s license was in question, so he was no longer allowed to fly drones. This job still involved long workdays outdoors helping to lug gear and otherwise conduct tests. Above: Project Wing Australia. Image Credit: Google/YouTube/Project Wing While he worked that job, he tried to transfer to other jobs within Google. But then he was given a poor performance review. Again, that’s the kiss of death for transfer requests at Google. Only highly rated employees can move to other jobs, sources say. In December, after working as a ground operator for months, he was written up on a “performance plan,” the final step before firing someone at Google, sources tell us. Ultimately, Joe was given a choice: Accept being laid off, with severance, and sign the standard papers waiving his right to sue, or be fired with a long paper trail showing poor-performance assessments, sources told us. “They laid him off saying he was not a team player. He almost gave his life for the company, but he’s not a team player?” one person told us. The worst part is that, with his pilot’s license in jeopardy (perhaps permanently), Joe may not be able to fly aircraft again, which limits his abilities to get other jobs in his field. Trapped and can’t quit To understand why Joe and the rest of this crew didn’t just up and quit, it’s necessary to go back to 2014 when a bunch of people from Facebook wearing hoodies and tennis shoes flew private jets to New Mexico and made an offer to buy a startup called Titan Aerospace. Titan Aerospace was creating solar-powered drones that could stay aloft for years at a time and beam internet access down to earth. It fit in with Facebook’s Internet.org project. Facebook reportedly offered $60 million to buy Titan. But Google, which had similar ambitions, swooped in and outbid Facebook, acquiring Titan in April 2014. Titan employees were thrilled. Their hard-to-value-and-sell startup stock would become Google stock, vesting over four years, sources told us. All they had to do was continue working at a company with a reputation as a great place to work. At first Google was all in. It built Titan a brand-new $15 million building at a small airport in a suburb of Albuquerque. But eight months after employees moved into the new building, Google started to “dismantle” Titan, as one person described it. In August 2015, Google reorganized itself into Alphabet, transferring its hodgepodge of “moonshot” businesses into a category called “other bets.” Facing public scrutiny and business objectives for the first time, several of those “other bets” had very public meltdowns. In October 2015, Google was rethinking Titan too. It decided to move Titan to Mountain View and laid off a bunch of employees. It gave the remaining Titan staffers generous relocation assistance to move to California, enough to cover the cost of things like taking a $60,000 loss on a fast sale of a home, people told us. Above: Astro Teller, head of the Google X lab, wearing a pair of Google Glass. Image Credit: Flickr/Techcrunch Employees simply had to commit to a standard term: stay at Google for a year or be obligated to pay back the relocation money. A month after relocating those employees, and despite an investment we estimate to be upwards of $75 million, Google shut Titan down completely and laid off more Titan employees. Some found other jobs inside of Google, including the flight-testing folks who landed at Project Wing. But when problems arose at Wing, former Titan staffers felt stuck. Leaving before one year meant being on the hook to repay maybe tens of thousands of dollars that had already been spent moving to California. For some it also meant forfeiting valuable unvested stock. Low-performance reviews meant they couldn’t transfer into other roles at Google. It was a lose-lose situation. Even so, some of the team working “couldn’t take it anymore” and did quit before their full payout matured, sources say. A coup in Project Wing Since these troubles last year, there was a coup of sorts within the Project Wing group, people told us. The single-wing design was eventually scrapped, replaced by a new design with a fuselage. The new drone successfully delivered Chipotle food in a special test site in Virginia in September. The leader of the team, David Vos, who backed Nannini’s testing schedule and allegedly had his share of head-butting with the flight-testing team, left the company in October, with people confirming to us he was essentially pushed out. Vos did not respond to a request for comment. Above: Vos. Image Credit: Google/YouTube/Project Wing When the leader of Google X Astro Teller was asked about Vos leaving by the Financial Times, he said, “We definitely aren’t going to keep things the way they are for one second longer when the right thing to do is to make a change, which it frequently is, because that’s learning.” Nannini remains at X with Project Wing. Several people told us he was promoted, but a representative would neither confirm nor deny that. Each X project is its own dominion and each winds up with its own culture, one person told us. Project Wing was particularly known inside Google X for its politics. The experience for veterans in other parts of X, or parent company Alphabet, may be completely different. Hohne, the Google X spokeswoman, says that plenty of ex-military people are having fabulous careers at X, including some in leadership positions, and she lauded the unique skills, judgment, and field experience that veterans bring. She also said that today, more than half of the current Project Wing team has been in the military or spent parts of their careers in the defense industry, as is common in aviation circles. Hohne declined to comment on the specifics of Joe’s situation, citing HR confidentiality, but said that safety and employee well-being are of the highest priority and that the company follows all applicable regulations. Google X also employs “experts” to help teams mitigate challenging work environments, and the Project Wing team made changes to the test site after spending time with one such adviser. If an employee has a medical issue, Google follows the guidance and restrictions of the medical provider and engages with the employee to determine if a “reasonable accommodation” is necessary, she said. But some say the problem is deeper and that the Wing team’s experience is symptomatic of a bias that the tech company has yet to fully come to terms with. “Google makes a very big public effort with employees to try and eliminate bias,” one person with knowledge of Google X said. But for “older” employees and for “anybody who was in the military,” at least in Project Wing, “there’s a huge unconscious bias,” this person said. As Silicon Valley takes a hard look in the mirror, it is increasingly apparent it needs to examine its whole culture. It needs to make sure its mantra of “work fast and break things” applies only to its technology and not to its people. This story originally appeared on Www.businessinsider.com.

Join For Free Today’s data climate is fast-paced and it’s not slowing down. Here’s why your current integration solution is not enough. Brought to you in partnership with Liaison Technologies. The Runscope team recently published a post on a pretty cool approach to using Google Sheets for running API tests with multiple variable sets, which I thought is valuable at a couple of levels. They provide a template Google Sheet for anyone to follow where you can plug in your variable as well as your Runscope API key, which allows you to define the dimensions of the tests you wish to push to Runscope via their own API. The first thing that grabs me about this approach is how Runscope is allowing their customers to define and expand the dimensions of how they test their API using Runscope in a way that will speak to a wider audience — beyond just the usual API developer audience. Doing this in a spreadsheet allows Runscope customers to customize their API tests for exactly the scenarios they need, without Runscope having to customize and respond to each individual customer's needs and providing a nice balance. The second thing that interests me about their approach is the usage of a Google Sheet as a template for making API calls whether you are testing your APIs or doing any other scenario that an API enables. This type of templating of API calls opens up the API client to a much wider audience, making integration copy and pastable, shareable, collaborative, and something that anyone can reverse engineer and learn about the surface area of an API. In this scenario, it just happens to be the surface area of Runscope's API testing API. Runscope's approach is in alignment with my previous post about sharing data validation examples. A set of assertions could be defined within spreadsheets and any stakeholder could use the spreadsheet to execute and make sure the assertions are met. This would have huge implications for the average business user to help make sure API contracts are meeting business objectives. I'm considering using this approach to empower cities, counties, and states to test and validate human services API implementations as part of my Open Referral work. I told John Sheehan, the CEO of Runscope, that their approach was pretty creative, and he said that "Google sheets scripts are underrated" and that Google Sheets is the "API client for the every person." I agree. I'd like to see more spreadsheet templates like this used across the API lifecycle when it comes to design, deployment, management, testing, monitoring, and every other area of API operations. I'd also like to see more spreadsheet templates available for making calls to other common APIs, making APIs accessible to a much wider audience who is familiar with spreadsheets, and making them more likely to be closer to the actual problems in which API solutions are designed to solve. Is iPaaS solving the right problems? Not knowing the fundamental difference between iPaaS and iPaaS+ could cost you down the road. Brought to you in partnership with Liaison Technologies.

Home Technology Consumer & Gadgets April 2, 2017 Samsung's assistant Bixby in tough challenge to rivals April 2, 2017 by Rob Lever The new Samsung S8, incorporating its virtual assistant Bixby, seen on display in New York Samsung's Bixby is the new kid on the block of personal digital assistants and is likely to face a rough reception in a neighborhood dominated by tech sector rivals. Bixby—introduced at Samsung's unveiling of Galaxy S8 smartphones—aims to help the South Korean giant break into a surging market for voice-activated virtual assistants, which includes Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, Google's Assistant and Microsoft's Cortana. The latest personal digital assistant distinguishes itself from competitors by using voice commands rather than touch to control handsets or applications, factoring in location awareness and image recognition. The integrated camera function allows users to identify buildings, such as popular tourist sites, to access their websites and other information simply by snapping a photo. The photo recognition technology can also help users decipher menus in foreign languages, or find places to shop for specific items they photograph. "It impressed me that they were doing image recognition and context awareness," said Bob O'Donnell, analyst and consultant with Technalysis Research, who attended the presentation. "It adds some new twists we haven't seen before," he said, noting Bixby's ability to make recommendations. Yet Bixby is still a work in progress—the virtual entity did not speak at the New York demonstration. It has yet to be infused with technology from Samsung's recently acquired Viv, a company founded by creators of Apple's Siri. "It's not talking yet," O'Donnell said. "They have room to expand and grow." Sriram Thodla, senior director of services and new business at Samsung, speaks about the new voice assistant named 'Bixby' that is featured on the new Galaxy S8, in New York, March 29, 2017 Tough competitors Bixby will face competition from established players—even from Samsung's own phones, where users can choose to use Assistant, Cortana or Alexa. Richard Windsor, an independent analyst who writes the Radio Free Mobile blog, said Bixby may face problems because the "best-in-class Google Assistant" will be on the home button of the new phone, which is powered by Google-backed Android software. That means Bixby has a "fearsome competitor" on its own flagship device, according to the analyst. "Bixby is trying to do things a little differently but careful assessment of what Samsung demonstrated shows a service that has very little intelligence at all," Windsor said. Roger Kay of Endpoint Technologies Associates said Bixby might face challenges catching up with its rivals, which have been deployed for some time. "You can't build these things overnight," Kay said. "It would take years to create something as developed as Siri." Still, he noted, it is important for Samsung to be in the game. "These are table stakes," Kay said. "You can't not deal with voice. It's hands-free and can summarize a lot of things quickly." Amazon appears to have impacted the sector the most with its connected speakers using Alexa. The service allows users a wide range of voice interactions for music, news, purchases and connects with smart home devices. The new version of the Samsung Gear 360 camera is seen on display during a launch event for the Samsung Galaxy S8, in New York, on March 29, 2017 "Alexa is the top dog," Kay said. "Amazon has done the best work from a commercial perspective. They took it out of the theoretical to put it to work for things people want to do." Beyond the phone Samsung has also promoted Bixby as a remote hub for connected devices, which is another challenge as it takes the software beyond the smartphone. Patrick Moorhead, analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy, said Bixby's success in the connected home may depend on how much data it can collect. "Machine learning gets better the more training it gets and the more data it gets," Moorhead said. While Bixby cannot benefit from the large databases of competitors Apple and Windows, it could potentially sync with Samsung electronics and smart home appliances through Samsung's SmartThings platform. "Samsung ships so many devices from phones to Chromebooks to washing machines, it is picking up a different set of information, so it might end up being smarter than Siri," he said. "Siri doesn't know what's in your refrigerator, Samsung does." The app faces an uphill battle in a fragmented market where competing platforms don't always work together. Moorhead said tech companies are jockeying for a position in order to "get access to data—by using this interface they can build detailed profiles on you."

SEOUL: Samsung’s Bixby is the new kid on the block of personal digital assistants and is likely to face a rough reception in a neighbourhood dominated by tech sector rivals. Bixby was introduced at Samsung’s unveiling of the Galaxy S8 smartphones, it aims to help the South Korean giant break into a surging market for voice-activated virtual assistants, which includes Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, Google’s Assistant and Microsoft’s Cortana. The latest personal digital assistant distinguishes itself from competitors by using voice commands rather than touch to control handsets or applications, factoring in location awareness and image recognition. The integrated camera function allows users to identify buildings, such as popular tourist sites, to access their websites and other information simply by snapping a photo. The photo recognition technology can also help users decipher menus in foreign languages, or find places to shop for specific items they photograph. “It impressed me that they were doing image recognition and context awareness,” said Bob O’Donnell, analyst and consultant with Technalysis Research, who attended the presentation. “It adds some new twists we haven’t seen before,” he said, noting Bixby’s ability to make recommendations. Yet Bixby is still a work in progress the virtual entity did not speak at the New York demonstration. It has yet to be infused with technology from Samsung’s recently acquired Viv, a company founded by creators of Apple’s Siri. “It’s not talking yet,” O’Donnell said. “They have room to expand and grow.” Bixby faces competition from established players, even from Samsung’s own phones, where users can choose to use Assistant, Cortana or Alexa. Richard Windsor, an independent analyst who writes the Radio Free Mobile blog, said Bixby may face problems because the “best-in-class Google Assistant” will be on the home button of the new phone, which is powered by Google-backed Android software. That means Bixby has a “fearsome competitor” on its own flagship device, according to the analyst. “Bixby is trying to do things a little differently but careful assessment of what Samsung demonstrated shows a service that has very little intelligence at all,” Windsor said. Roger Kay of Endpoint Technologies Associates said Bixby might face challenges catching up with its rivals, which have been deployed for some time. “You can’t build these things overnight,” Kay said. “It would take years to create something as developed as Siri.” Still, he noted, it is important for Samsung to be in the game. “These are table stakes,” Kay said. “You can’t not deal with voice. It’s hands-free and can summarise a lot of things quickly.” Amazon appears to have impacted the sector the most with its connected speakers using Alexa. The service allows users a wide range of voice interactions for music, news, purchases and connects with smart home devices. “Alexa is the top dog,” Kay said. “Amazon has done the best work from a commercial perspective. They took it out of the theoretical to put it to work for things people want to do.” Samsung has also promoted Bixby as a remote hub for connected devices, which is another challenge as it takes the software beyond the smartphone. Patrick Moorhead, analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy, said Bixby’s success in the connected home may depend on how much data it can collect. “Machine learning gets better the more training it gets and the more data it gets,” Moorhead said. While Bixby cannot benefit from the large databases of competitors Apple and Windows, it could potentially sync with Samsung electronics and smart home appliances through Samsung’s SmartThings platform. “Samsung ships so many devices from phones to Chromebooks to washing machines, it is picking up a different set of information, so it might end up being smarter than Siri,” he said. “Siri doesn’t know what’s in your refrigerator, Samsung does.” The app faces an uphill battle in a fragmented market where competing platforms don’t always work together. Moorhead said tech companies are jockeying for a position in order to “get access to data by using this interface they can build detailed profiles on you.” AFP Sunday Magazine sunday magazine aaj kal Business Plus TGIF Zaiqa TV Company Financials Investor Information Contact us Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions © 2017 DailyTimes - ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Powered By opustech.co
Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Android Wear 2.0 Released For More Smartwatches By Adnan Farooqui on 04/02/2017 00:56 PDT Google gradually started rolling out the Android Wear 2.0 update for Fossil, Casio, and Tag Heuer smartwatches last week after first announcing the launch of this update back in February. Two new LG smartwatches were launched as the first wearable devices to come with Android Wear 2.0 out of the box. Google has already said that there’s a bug that’s delaying the roll out of this update but, nevertheless, Android Wear 2.0 is gradually making its way to more smartwatches. Google released Android Wear 2.0 for the Tag Heuer Connected, Fossil Q Founder, and Casio Smart Outdoor Watch WSD-F10 just last week. They were among the first smartwatches of their time to receive the update to Android Wear 2.0. Starting today, the Android Wear 2.0 is now available on the Fossil Q Wander, Fossil Q Marshal, Michael Kors Access, and the Nixon Mission smartwatch. Those who own one of these smartwatches can now get their hands on the latest iteration of Google’s operating system for wearable devices. It has already been confirmed previously that there will only be a handful of smartwatches that receive the Android Wear 2.0 update. Google is yet to explain what that bug is that’s delaying the roll out for these wearable devices but given that it’s able to send out the update gradually, it may not be something that throws a spanner in the works.

That is in an attempt to “focus and prioritize” in the features and apps Google deems more important, and might be simply the start of a talk service springtime cleaning we’ll find out more about at IO. It’s time once again to start gearing up for Bing IO, the search giant’s yearly designer seminar that’s constantly filled with shocks. In fact, scratch that: Bing is calling this season’s event an “outdoor developer festival”, therefore grab your celebration hat and get prepared to celebrate all things Android, Chrome, and much more. The Bing IO 2017 dates are might 17 through May 19, and it’s all going down within Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, Calif., in which the gathering happened in 2016.  We’re nevertheless digesting everything Google announced eventually year’s version, including Google Assistant, Google Home, the Allo and Duo apps, details on Android Nougat (though it didn’t have that title at the time), the Daydream VR platform, Android os Wear 2.0 and Android os Instant Apps.  In 2010’s occasion appears to be in the same way exciting, or at the least we are generated think you will have extra pep in Bing’s step because of the way the IO times and location had been revealed; previously this season, Bing created a more sophisticated puzzle for designers to resolve to unearth the important points.  If you’re a developer and thinking about Google IO 2017 enrollment, hop over to the Bing IO web site to start the sign-up process (note: you need to be invited to join up).  While this “festival” is aimed at developers, it is also relevant for anybody interested in Android, Chrome, phones, tablets, smart house products, brand new applications, digital truth and, among other moonshots, self-driving vehicles.  To Ready the main event, read on for all your news and rumors we’ve heard to date about Bing IO 2017!  Say hello to Android Os O The celebrity of IO, since is tradition, would be the newest taste of Android. After in alphabetic purchase – Android Nougat is the most present release – Bing will officially welcome Android os O come May. While we have no idea the next form of Android’s official title yet (are we set for another submission process?), Android os Oreo appears to be the front-runner now. Just what will most likely happen is Bing will talk about its next mobile OS update at IO, yet hold off starting it till later on within the 12 months. Considering Android Os 7.0 Nougat don’t publicly launch until August 2016, this may probably be the case for Android Os O.  But exactly what are we set for with Android O? Christmas time arrived early as Google announced the Android os O developer preview in mid-March, giving united states a look at some very early features for sale in the operating-system. The most exciting options that come with the build, that is directed at developers, is “Background limits”. This may make apps less taxing on your own device’s battery by making limitations more transparent to designers. The function looks to accomplish for your battery pack life exactly what Data Saver did for wireless bills.  Addititionally there is picture-in-picture for watching videos while doing other tasks, updates to notifications, including snooze, and animation support for many app icons.  One last Android os O goodie of note is Sony caused Google to bring the company’s LDAC codec to Android O devices, that’ll deliver improved sound quality over Bluetooth for the listening pleasure.   As Android os looks to stay competitive aided by the iOS operating-system, try to find Google to talk up every methods Android O bests Apple’s platform. What is the phrase on Android Wear 2.0? Android os Wear 2.0 launched in February, so while it’s unlikely for Bing to announce an important update to its revamped wearable os at IO, we expect there to be some talk associated with the wrist.  To begin with, if Android os Wear 2.0 hasn’t appeared on all old smartwatches by then, we’re able to be in for the statement regarding that extremely thing.  We mightn’t be amazed if Android Wear 2.0 apps are announced either, and now we could even see a new smartwatch. No rumblings of stated view have started yet, but there is sufficient time prior to the show.  With Motorola the largest hold out for the latest form of Android Wear currently, maybe a magnificent Google IO unveil is available? Only a thought. Google Residence intrusion Bing introduced its very first smart speaker at Google IO 2016 in the form of Bing Residence (just how many times are you able to write “Bing” in a sentence, amiright?), which year could see an updated form of these devices or brand new features available to the first. The strongest rumor currently is the fact that Google is planning to add phone calling to Home, allowing users to communicate via sound through the presenter.  Considering Google currently has its venture Fi and Google Voice services ready to go, it may not be too much of a stretch for Google Home to all of a sudden find its calling chops. Phone calling can be apparently into the running for chief competing Amazon Echo, which does put the stress on Google to provide the function eventually. Another feasible function for Google Residence is numerous user help, which we could see introduced at IO.  Bing Chrome enhancement Another area of focus at Google IO will likely be Chrome, and might consist of sets from new Chromebooks to enhanced web browser features.  Many likely developments we’ll read about though are features including Android os apps working on all future Chromebooks. As Google along with other technology leaders check out more closely connect mobile and computing os’s together, Google will in all probability discuss just how it’s accomplishing this for the advantage of designers, and market viewing at home. Brand new Pixel phones? Perhaps Google simply announced the Pixel and Pixel XL phones in October 2016, but rumors have been heating that already the Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL and even a Pixel XXL (though we question it will likely be called that) have been in the works. It’s possible Bing could unveil brand new mobile devices at IO 2017, though we’re putting this into the not-very-likely category.  Not only is the distance only a little too close to the very first devices’ launch, but Bing’s head of equipment stated Bing is about to stay glued to an annual launch period using the devices, which places a launch date later on into the 12 months. He did, but confirm brand new Pixel smartphones are coming, so at the very least we’ve that. Virtual truth, Chromecast and the rest There is no question Google will announce items, services and/or updates beyond these main groups at IO 2017. Some tips about what else we may see: Though, like Pixel, it might be too early the Google Daydream View 2, there is a strong opportunity we’ll have news regarding the VR front from the Big G. Maybe a headset cost reduction, or updates in just how developers create and publish content for virtual truth?  With Bing Play looking to market great apps and games across all equipment platforms, we mightn’t be amazed to see enough time specialized in this really subject in front of the developer audience. On the entertainment front, whispers are circulating that Bing Assistant could become available on more third-party products, expanding its origins beyond the Nvidia Shield 2017, where the digital helper currently makes a property. This could certainly sound right doing, and an announcement on extra lovers could be in the cards.  Other opportunities consist of updates to Android TV, though those will likely be small if any are established.  We could be set for a brand new Chromecast things have been fairly quiet regarding the streaming disk since the Chromecast Ultra went on purchase.  The last potential IO agenda item we can speak to with authority right now is Hangouts, and also by a more substantial measure, each of Bing’s texting platforms.  Bing recently announced two brand new Hangouts offerings intended for enterprise users – Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat – but there is quickly confusion as to perhaps the consumer version of Hangouts would hang in there or, as had been recommended, the more recent Duo and Allo apps would take the place of average-user chat services. This isn’t also to mention the revamped Google Voice solution Google rolled away in January. There are obviously way too many Google-branded messaging platforms, as well as perhaps Google will finally prepare yourself to drop what’s no longer working and concentrate on making a couple of great talk offerings. Actually, it currently started a talk application clearing out in late March. This might be still notably wishful thinking given Google’s background, but IO might be a turning point for Google, one where it prevents presenting new talk apps and begins building robust platforms everyone else really wants to utilize.

According to a Japanese newspaper on Saturday, US tech firms Apple, Google and Amazon threw their hats into the Toshiba bid. Currently, there are 10 bidders including the world’s third largest NAND flash maker Western Digital, Korean chipmaker SK hynix, Taiwanese tech firm Hon Hai and US chipmaker Broadcom. Toshiba decided to sell its lucrative chip unit last month to make up for the loss of its US nuclear unit Westinghouse, which filed for bankruptcy protection. Apple’s interest in bidding has gained attention as it is a key client of Toshiba and Samsung’s mobile NAND flash. If the world’s largest smartphone maker is capable of supplying NAND for its smartphones, Samsung will lose its main client. As to the internet firms, Google and Amazon, they may want to buy NAND makers as they can make their own data servers without relying on chipmakers in the upcoming cloud and artificial intelligence era, experts said.  “The US tech firms -- Apple, Google and Amazon -- have become the next attractive bidders following Western Digital as Toshiba can have stable supply chains (for smartphones or data servers) from them,” an industry source told The Korea Herald. Western Digital is currently the most attractive bidder as the US chip giant and Toshiba have long maintained a close relationship by jointly running Toshiba’s key NAND flash production base in Yokaichi. “Then comes SK hynix, which can create synergy with Toshiba as the same chipmakers. Hon Hai is the least attractive bidder as Toshiba and the Japanese government do not want to sell the firm to Chinese companies because of the technology leak concerns,” the source added. Asahi Shimbun and Yomiuri Shimbun said when Chinese and Taiwan companies acquire Toshiba, that could lead to Toshiba’s memory chip technology being used in military technology. If SK acquires Toshiba, it will become the world’s largest NAND flash maker. Currently, Samsung is the largest provider with a 37 percent share, followed by Toshiba with 18 percent, Western Digital with 17 percent, Micron Technology with 10 percent and SK hynix with 9.6 percent. However, even if SK hynix buys the chip unit, it may suffer from the winner’s curse, Daishin Securities said. SK hynix reportedly has 4 trillion won ($3.5 billion) in cash asset, much lower than the 20 trillion won of the estimated bidding price. If the firm excessively borrows money for the acquisition, it may face a financial struggle when the boom of the chip business slows down.  By Shin Ji-hye (shinjh@heraldcorp.com) 영어뉴스를 통한 ListeningㆍReading 실력 향상 단기 학습 프로그램 [NEST] 1.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals General  ⋮  Mobile Dark Days Ahead For YouTube After Australian Government Joins Advertising Boycott By Zara Ali Mar 31, 2017 11Shares Share Tweet Submit Google is witnessing dark days after its inappropriate ad-placement received a major backlash from popular brands like L’Oréal, PepsiCo, and others. Latest entry in the exit string is Australian government which has announced the suspension of all of its advertisements from YouTube. Today, the Australian Government is withdrawing “all non-corporate campaign advertising” from YouTube. This decision is a repercussion of YouTube placing ads on extremist channels and videos that support terrorist activities. Recently, US-based brands like Wal-Mart, PepsiCo, and AT&T discontinued their ad partnership with YouTube along with some UK-based brands like The Guardian. Related Download All New Stock Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ Wallpapers Advertisements from Department of Health to Defence Force recruiting ads by Australian Government will no longer appear on the video-streaming website. However, this does not include ads from government-backed corporations like Australia Post. Australian Government is not the first one to assert suspension; even British Government followed the same drill to oppose YouTube’s inconsiderate ad placement tools. Google also released a statement earlier, stating that it will work on its ad-placement techniques to make sure that this behaviour does not continue but just a statement is not enough to keep the brands hooked. British Government suspended its ads after they were featured on videos from Klux Klan leader David Duke. Advertisement Commenting on the decision to withdraw ads from YouTube, Australian Special Minister of State Senator Scott Ryan said, it would block taxpayer money from “inadvertently flowing to unsavory organizations” via YouTube. “The Australian Government… will continue to request updates from Google on the steps being taken to mitigate risks,” he added. Sighting the bulk exit from its ad programs, Google says that it is already performing an “extensive review.” Of its advertising policies. And it expects to “give brands more control over where their ads appear.” Related April Fools’ Day Heads Up! Don’t Fall For These Too Good To Be True Pranks By Tech Brands Given the exodus from YouTube advertising, we hope that Google thoroughly reviews everything that is wrong with its ad-placement tools and policies. If it fails to make amendments, then we can expect more brands to take the exit route as the display of ads on extremist videos not only harm the brand image, but it also funds money to trouble groups.

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Hold your sides and check out these April… Hold your sides and check out these April Fools’ Day tech jokes By Andy Boxall and Albert Khoury — April 1, 2017 6:40 PM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: April 1 is a day when you shouldn’t believe any product announcement being made, as there’s an excellent chance it’ll be utter nonsense. And if it turns out to be real, then either the marketing folk need to be fired for launching on on that day, or your product needs a rethink, as the world clearly thought it was a joke. We’re here to guide you through the nightmare of what’s real and isn’t with our favorite April Fools’ Day gags for 2017. Keep checking back, as we’ll update with new ones that tickle our collective funny bones. MH40C1 Concrete Over-Ear Headphones Master & Dynamic is known for its use of premium materials to get the best sound quality. We’ve seen headphones made from forged aluminium, leather, and brass, but this weekend the New York-based audio company dropped some heavy news via the company blog. The engineers introduced the MH40C1 — wireless on-ear headphones that weigh in at 10.6 pounds. The company promises the same premium quality and comfort its customers are used to. This set is based on the MH40 over-ear headphones, which were introduced in May 2014. “Master & Dynamic has consistently chosen the road less traveled. As of today, that road is paved with concrete,” said company founder and CEO Jonathan Levine. The concrete MH40 Wireless On-Ear Headphones are available for $399. Honda Horn Emojis Wouldn’t it be nice if your car’s horn could more closely convey your intentions and messages? After all, there’s no difference between a short, polite “thank you” beep and an impatient, longer “hey, whattaya doing” lean besides the length of the honk. Honda is here to help. Horn Emojis come to us from Honda Dream Laboratories and are described by Chief Engineer Janet Parker as “a driver-to-driver communication system that offers a full range of expressive horn sounds connected to a few familiar faces.” Simply press a button to show how you feel. A “happy Honda honk” can be used to say “hello,” while a more defeating-sounding one will let you share your dismal rush hour mood with those around you. The special emoting horn can be found on the all-new Odyssey — at least during this year’s April Fools’ weekend. A Live Tinder Date The world’s most popular dating app matches 26 million people globally each day, but despite this, many of us might not know what goes on when people connect. For those who are too nervous to take the plunge into a world where a potential partner could be just a swipe away, Tinder has something just for you. The folks behind the swipe celebrated different types of “dates” by live streaming one on Facebook. The video went up and delivered as promised. Go here to see for yourself (scroll down to the post from March 31 at 3:04 p.m. ET). EventBrite Retro Have you ever longed to go back in time and revisit a sporting, music, or other event from your youth, or one that you missed out on? Or are you an old soul who would love to travel back to an iconic moment that occurred before you were born? “Eventbrite allows you to experience today’s greatest events,” Eventbrite CEO Julia Hartz stated in a company blog post. “With Eventbrite Retro, you’ll soon be able to attend iconic live experiences from the past.” To write the software, the engineering team turned to O’Reilly Auto Parts, which offers a crucial piece of equipment that could usually be found in gullwinged time-traveling cars. This may signal the end of FOMO (fear of missing out), but caution must be taken. “ … the last thing we’d want to do was disrupt the time space continuum and create a paradox,” said Principal QA engineer Noah Harris. Kodak Moments Experiment We all dread the loss of our smartphone data. You can’t put a price on your photos, videos, and any sensitive data, but that didn’t stop the people from Kodak Moments UK from trying. A man from the company offered passersby the chance to try a “super fast charger” he was carrying around. Trusting people handed over their phone, which he placed on the charging pad. The screen then went black with the static words “Deleting … ,” “Deleting Data,” and “Deleting Cloud Backups” along the top and a terrifyingly fast scrolling of what is presumably being purged below. Each innocent bystander took it differently, ranging from astonishment to rising anger. The man then offered a pittance to cover the damages, going up to 200 British Pounds. Before they can completely break down, the company rep showed them that their phones were safely hidden away, and the affected one was his. Kodak Moments wants to remind you that printed photos, a service offered by the company through its app, can never be accidentally erased. Google Wind Holland’s strengths lie in its economies and DJs, but it also deals with heavy rainfall 145 days a year, according to this video from Google Nederland. So the Google Cloud Platform team is launching Google Wind, which will utilize Holland’s windmills to clear the skies of rainy clouds. “Google Wind then uses Machine Learning to recognize cloud patterns and orchestrate the network of windmills when rain is approaching,” the video description reads. “Test results look very promising.” Samsung Exynos Yoga Processor We are proud to introduce #ExynosYogaProcessor for flexible mobile devices! pic.twitter.com/FrFzHDghbV &mdash; Samsung Exynos (@SamsungExynos) March 31, 2017 With rumors flying around regarding a flexible phone from Samsung, the Korean tech conglomerate decided to play along with an April Fools’ gag. In doing so, it got more publicity for its Exynos Processor, the latest of which should be making their way into the company’s flagship S8 phones. Samsung tweeted a photo of its new Exynos Yoga processor, which was designed to flex within bendy phones. Amazon Petlexa Now your furbabies can take advantage of their humans’ smart home tech and toys. Petlexa gives your furry family members the ability communicate with Alexa through Amazon Echo. This new pet-friendly feature can track the steps your hamster runs in his wheel, order some sushi (through Amazon, of course) for the cat, or help the dog play fetch. Swim Desk It wasn’t too long ago that standing desks became the must-have alternative to traditional sit-down workspaces. They purported to improve efficiency while reducing strain on your body from sitting down all day. Then standing up alone wasn’t enough — we should exercise while we work, via contraptions down at our feet. You can walk, stretch, and pedal your way to health, all while making a living. You could take things a step further and get a treadmill desk. But what if you have bad joints or are unable to use one for other health reasons? Because of this, people swear by swimming. It should come as no surprise that the folks at ThinkGeek put their top minds to work to bring you the Swim Desk. At $1,999, the heated Swim Desk weighs over eight tons when full, so check your building codes before purchase. You can adjust the current put out by the 5-horsepower motor, and integrated LED lights are helpful for those late nights at the office. Netflix Live On March 31, Netflix previewed a new show called Netflix Live, in which Will Arnett offers narrations of objects he’s viewing, mostly related to what you’d find in an office. His seemingly off-the-cuff remarks include descriptions, anecdotes, and numerous tangents. Joke or not, the show was supposed to premiere on April 1, but it has since been canceled. Netflix had this to say on its website: “Netflix Live has been canceled. We miscalculated the number of people who like to binge-watch microwaves. Dave from analytics is in trouble.” Google Maps and Ms. Pac-Man Last April Fools’, Google Maps let users play Pac-Man using its software, and this year you can wander around your favorite neighborhood in the guise of his wife. That’s right — you can now play Ms. Pac-Man on your computer or mobile device using Google Maps. We tried it out in New York City; an ideal stage due to its grid layout. The game will not work if you try it in an area with few roads (Central Park wasn’t suitable), but you can click that you’re feeling lucky and go somewhere else. Just like in the classic game, there are ghosts, dots, and Power Pellets. When you run off one side of the screen, you will appear on the other. Best of all, the original intro jingle and sound effects are all intact. To play, simply open Google Maps and click on the Ms. Pac-Man icon. We cleared an entire stage, including all the dots and cherries, and the game didn’t end. Perhaps we expected a level 2 with more traffic, ahem, ghosts? Lyft Mono Ride-hailing app Lyft has gone all out with this one. The Mono is a piece of wearable tech for grabbing a Lyft ride with just a flick of the thumb. The LED lighting array — in magenta, naturally — pulsates at different speeds, depending on how close your Lyft car is. There’s a glitzy website devoted to the Mono, and even a pop-up shop in San Francisco where you can try it out, according to The Verge. But don’t fall for it — the Mono is very much an April Fools’ Day joke. However, that’s not going to stop Lyft giving a few of the versions it built for the promotion away, and you can enter here. Man Crates Man Freights Gift service Man Crates now lets you do more than send a crate as a gift. The Man Freights service enables you to deliver it yourself, inside a crate of your own. Provided you’re a “medium-sized person” and can get to a delivery center, you’ll get nailed inside the crate, ready to be handed over to the recipient after only two or three business days. OnePlus Dash Energy Dash Charge is OnePlus’s own fast charging system for its smartphones, and now it’s introducing Dash Energy, which brings power-boosting goodness to you personally. Apparently, it’s a “Neural performance enhancer instilled into a caffeinated beverage suitable for human consumption,” which sounds an awful lot like an energy drink to us. Check out the video above to see the effects, which include instant alertness, energy, and concentration. The great thing is you can actually try it out, because OnePlus will be distributing Dash Energy at a few special locations in London, plus through online through promotions in Europe, Finland, and India on April 1. You can find a list of them here. Lexus Lane Valet Lexus feels our pain. There’s nothing worse than getting stuck behind a slow lane hog, but with its new Lane Valet feature, we can shift them out of the way safely and easily. It’s autonomous driving technology, but for the car in front of you. Kik Storyz We love subtle April Fools’ Day gags, and this is definitely one of them. Kik Messenger has introduced Storyz, a way to share tiny video clips through the platform that friends can subscribe to and watch. The videos then expire after 23 hours and 57 minutes. Wait. That’s almost exactly what Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp copied from Snapchat, right? Kik’s not falling for it, and neither should you. The only thing is if Kik does add a Story-style feature in the future, this may come back to haunt it. World of Tanks — Next Stop: Mars Another April Fools’ gag you can actually try out for yourself. World of Tanks heads to Mars for a limited time, where you battle against each other and the alien hordes in a spectacular low-gravity environment, complete with teleportation units for the ultimate in surprise attacks. The game mode, called Next Stop: Mars, is only available between March 31 and April 2. SkunkLock Organic Want an environmentally friendly way of protecting your bike, that also looks a tiny bit cute? Then you want the SkunkLock Organic, a follow-up to the company’s unusual bike lock that’s filled with a vomit-inducing gas. That’s right, the SkunkLock isn’t the April Fools’ gag. The SkunkLock Organic attaches a real skunk to your bike. Roku SnackSuggest It’s sometimes difficult to satisfy food cravings when you’re watching Game of Thrones. Roku’s new SnackSuggest feature says you need chicken wings, mutton, and ale to complete the experience. For Vampire Diaries, how about some garlic fries and red velvet cupcakes? It’s scientific too, basing snack recommendations on your BMI, dietary requirements, and taste preferences. Watching The Walking Dead may never be the same again … Honda H-Swipe Why restrict Tinder’s popular swipe-based method of finding a date to an app? Honda realized the windscreen wipers on its cars could perform a similar function, and so the automaker is introducing s-wipers, the H-Swipe app, and geo-location tech on future vehicles. Location data finds a potential date, and the wipers are used to signal your interest — left for “phwoor!” and right for “nahhh” presumably.

Google always does a great job, from the Pokemon Google Maps overlay to a smart mailbox, but there are a few from other companies worth mentioning. Here's a rundown of all the hillarious (or strange) tech-related April Fools Day jokes from around the web. Google Gnome One of Google's product launches from last year was the Google Home, a $129 smart speaker with Google Assistant. Now the company is teasing the "Google Gnome," an outside version of the Home. You can ask it weather questions, let it control your lawnmower and other tools, and even dress it up in accessories. The Google Gnome has a page on the Google Store, but unfortunately you can't buy it. I really want a rain coat for my Google Home, though. Mrs. Pac-Man in Google Maps For April Fools' 2015, Google added Pac-Man into Google Maps and Ingress. This year, Mrs Pac-Man is invading Google Maps. For regions of the world already on April 1st, a new Mrs. Pac-Man button is visible on the mobile app. You then have to control Mrs. Pac-Man on real-life streets, and of course, outrun the Ghosts. Google's Bubble Wrap Keyboard (English subtitles are available) Google Japan's prank is pretty funny - it's a bubble wrap keyboard. The idea is to pop bubbles on a bubble wrap sheet to form words, then feed the sheet through a reader to send the message. Some of the bubble wrap sheets are even scented. Google Assistant Google has plenty of Easter Eggs in Google Assistant, and as you might expect, there's one for April Fools' Day too. When asked, Assistant will offer advice on how not to get pranked, such as "If something seems too good to be true today, it probably is." Google Wind Google's Netherlands division has its own April Fools' Day gag, named 'Google Wind.' The idea is to use machine learning to control the weather, using Holland's famous windmills. I'll admit, this one is pretty great. Netflix Live Will Arnet has been in plenty of Netflix original content, from BoJack Horseman to A Series of Unfortunate Events. For April Fools' Day, Netflix is proud to share 'Netflix Live', which is nearly an hour of Arnett commentating ordinary events like toasting bread and completing a crossword puzzle. It's actually funnier than it sounds. You can watch the full thing here (a Netflix subscription is required). T-Mobile ONEsie T-Mobile's prank is a onesie, with "full-body coverage" and a built-in 4G LTE hotspot. You can actually buy it for $40, but the real one doesn't have any tech inside it. Hulu Hu With the claim that the human attention span has "dropped to eight seconds," Hulu has released 'Hu.' It's just a library of short clips from existing Hulu content, and you actually need an account to see them. This is probably the lamest April Fools' Day gag in the list - better luck next year, guys. OnePlus Dash drink OnePlus is really proud of its Dash Charge feature, even to the point of enlisting celebrities to talk about it. For April Fools', the company made real Dash Charge energy drinks. You can find our review of the drink here. Lyft Mono For April Fools' Day, Lyft has announced the 'Lyft Mono.' It's a wearable glove, vaguely resembling a Nintendo Power Glove. This gag is actually real, and once you put it on and get the app, sticking out your thumb will hail a Lyft cab. You can sign up to for a chance to get one here. Honor BFF We all need some positive reinforcement every now and then, right? Honor thinks so, and created the Honor BFF. This imaginary phone uses machine learning to periodically give you compliments and motivation. Hopefully it ships with Android 7.1 Nougat. Google Haptic Helpers This is probably my favorite gag so far. In order to create a more realistic virtual reality experience, you can schedule a "haptic helper" to come to your house and help create a more realistic environment. Just watch the video, it's hilarious. Amazon Petlexa Alexa is cool and all, but your furry friends need one too. As the name implies, Petlexa is Alexa for your pets. Contour by SlickWraps Putting a skin on your phone or tablet is too much work. For April Fool's Day, Slickwraps is teasing the 'Countour' - a machine that sprays on device skins. Frankly, I'm not sure if this is actually real or not, but there is a page for it on SlickWrap's store. Nvidia GTX G-Assist How many times have you been playing an online game, only to be interrupted by someone in real life? NVIDIA has made the 'G Assist,' a flash drive that can take over for you if you're busy. It can also help you beat boss battles, and provides periodic reminders to consume energy drinks. More information and a video can be found here. Google's data center on Mars If you have important data, you need a backup. That's why Google announced its first interplanetary data center, named "Ziggy Stardust," on the Google Cloud Platform Blog today. Located in the Gale Crater on Mars, it will store a cache of data from Earth to prevent irrecoverable loss when a planetary disaster strikes. Google hopes to finish the data center by 2018. LineageOS' mascot CyanogenMod's mascot, Cid, was one of the most recognizable icons in the Android community. As the spiritual successor to CyanogenMod, LineageOS has created its own mascot - 'Ink'. The project also announced 'Br0zip,' an artificial intelligence that can port LineageOS to any device in no time at all. Chromebook accessories Even though most Chromebooks can now run Android apps, you still can't use your Chromebook like an Android phone/tablet for all use cases. Until now, that is. Google has announced a Chromebook Groupie Stick (seen above), a Chromebook Cardboard headset, and a Chromebook armband. See the company's blog post for more info. Exynos Yoga Processor Remember when curved phones were a thing? Maybe we'll see more in the coming months, because Samsung has just unveiled the Exynos Yoga Processor - the first flexible mobile SoC. Anyone up for a Galaxy Flex? Carved screen protector Carved is a small Indiana-based phone case company, but now they are working on a wooden screen protector. Why hasn't this been done before? I'll take ten. I'm Feeling Woof/I'm Feeling Meow By force-touching the Google app icon in iOS, you can select "I'm Feeling Woof" or "I'm Feeling Meow." These give your pets access to the stuff they care about - from dog food to balls of yarn. More info can be found on Google's blog post. Waze maps for Mars According to the company's blog, Waze is has begun to map the surface of Mars. Certain members of the Waze community will also be sent to the Red Planet to more accurately map the surface. JerryRigEverything's NoPhone video If you haven't heard about it, the NoPhone is a solid piece of plastic designed to simulate the feeling of a phone in your pocket. I'm not really sure if anyone uses it, but JerryRigEverything is happy to break it just as much as any other phone. Google Translate for Heptapod B Using machine learning, Google Translate can now decrypt messages written in Heptapod B - the language from the film Arrival. On an unrelated note, it looks like someone from Google is still rocking a Nexus 10. See Google's blog post for more info. Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s ASUS has an April Fools gag too - the Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s Veritas Blue Limited Special Edition. I would probably buy this phone. MKBHD's Nokia 3310 review You may have heard about the updated Nokia 3310, but it turns out the original is an amazing smartphone. Okay, maybe not, but the video is pretty funny. Open GApps Femto Do you need to flash the latest Gapps package on your device, but you don't have a stable network connection? Not to worry, the Open GApps Femto package is here to help. It uses the United States HAARP service (which is not real, but just pretend) to download the latest GApps package. You can find more info at the GApps blog.   That concludes our coverage of April Fools' Day in the tech world. Let us know in the comments below which gag you liked the most!

Greg Abbott https://kodi.tv/ Sergio Carmona Scariest one... seriously... Artem Russakovskii Not even a 503 or something? Just a 200? Ballsy re: SEO. SickoPsycho oops- beat me to it. Yeah they actuqally had me going until I compared a whois of kodi.tv vs kickasstorrents.com, a site that actually was seized. The whois data would show that it is not official. Derik Taylor So this is one I find interesting. Could it technically be a criminal offense to falsify a domain seizure? How would that work? Greg Abbott Doubt it, technically a website isn't an official document. mondeca I hope every year that Google will announce something real and awesome on April Fools' Day, like they did with Gmail. Once again, I am disappointed. JG It isn't technically April Fools Day yet... Least not in the US...

Trooper311 Gimme dat gnome yo. abqnm The Google Haptic Helpers was OK, until they applied the "I Voted!" sticker to the guy's shirt. I was laughing and crying at the same time. Corbin Davenport Yep, that had me laughing too. AdrianFDiratama . How about JG I'd actually like to see Google produce the Google Gnome.... All they'd need to do is add a battery (and Qi charging) to a Google Home and stick it in a new Gnome shell... Make sure its IP68 and maybe even MIL-STD-810G certified. It'd be a fun little gadget to put on the picnic table of your next summer back yard get together. Pump out some tunes, order pizza & Ubers for everyone to go home in, etc... Or take out when you work in the garden & don't want to get your phone dirty... Maybe even produce one with an LTE radio (and GPS). Then you could take it out of WiFi range camping. Wake up and find him chilling next to your tent in his little chair "Hey Google, how's today's weather? When does the rafting place open? How far away from the camp site is it?" cdotlawrence Maybe like a more customizable (from a looks standpoint), durable, & usable-on-go version of Home? Google Home Pro/Ultra? Interesting idea, but not sure why you wouldn't do most of the things it would do on your phone. Some specific use cases like you mentioned but beyond those, idk. Guess it'd be a highly functional, portable, durable and customizable speaker? Suicide_Note Ms. Pac-Man in Maps is live for me here in the US, even though it isn't April 1st yet. Daishi No Clarity Speaker??? Artem Russakovskii Why would that be in this post? Urmil Shroff What if we actually get the Mars data center many years from now? Eumelanin Knight I love this day.

This will cover all A1, A and B category stations. According to the minister, “the Wi-Fi facility is being provided at railway stations without any capital investment from Railway’s side.” That basically means that Google is funding the WiFi rollout for the government. According to details shared with Parliament, WiFi is currently available in 115 railways stations, and has been commissioned in another 103 stations. A full list is available here. Note that when the project launched, Google said it was planning to cover 400 stations in total. So who’ll do the rest? Note that Google is also planning to launch 200 WiFi hotspots in Pune under the Smart Cities mission. It also has Google Station, a platform for Public WiFi which allows venues and locations to partner with the company to provide high speed Internet.

PHOTO: AFP WASHINGTON: Samsung’s Bixby is the new kid on the block of personal digital assistants and is likely to face a rough reception in a neighborhood dominated by tech sector rivals. Bixby — introduced at Samsung’s unveiling of Galaxy S8 smartphones — aims to help the South Korean giant break into a surging market for voice-activated virtual assistants, which includes Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, Google’s Assistant and Microsoft’s Cortana. The latest personal digital assistant distinguishes itself from competitors by using voice commands rather than touch to control handsets or applications, factoring in location awareness and image recognition. The integrated camera function allows users to identify buildings, such as popular tourist sites, to access their websites and other information simply by snapping a photo. The photo recognition technology can also help users decipher menus in foreign languages, or find places to shop for specific items they photograph. 5 features that make Galaxy S8 the next iPhone killer “It impressed me that they were doing image recognition and context awareness,” said Bob O’Donnell, analyst and consultant with Technalysis Research, who attended the presentation. “It adds some new twists we haven’t seen before,” he said, noting Bixby’s ability to make recommendations. Yet Bixby is still a work in progress — the virtual entity did not speak at the New York demonstration. It has yet to be infused with technology from Samsung’s recently acquired Viv, a company founded by creators of Apple’s Siri. “It’s not talking yet,” O’Donnell said. “They have room to expand and grow.” Bixby will face competition from established players — even from Samsung’s own phones, where users can choose to use Assistant, Cortana or Alexa. Richard Windsor, an independent analyst who writes the Radio Free Mobile blog, said Bixby may face problems because the “best-in-class Google Assistant” will be on the home button of the new phone, which is powered by Google-backed Android software. That means Bixby has a “fearsome competitor” on its own flagship device, according to the analyst. “Bixby is trying to do things a little differently but careful assessment of what Samsung demonstrated shows a service that has very little intelligence at all,” Windsor said. Samsung announces Bixby ahead of the Galaxy S8’s unveiling Roger Kay of Endpoint Technologies Associates said Bixby might face challenges catching up with its rivals, which have been deployed for some time. “You can’t build these things overnight,” Kay said. “It would take years to create something as developed as Siri.” Still, he noted, it is important for Samsung to be in the game. “These are table stakes,” Kay said. “You can’t not deal with voice. It’s hands-free and can summarize a lot of things quickly.” Amazon appears to have impacted the sector the most with its connected speakers using Alexa. The service allows users a wide range of voice interactions for music, news, purchases and connects with smart home devices. “Alexa is the top dog,” Kay said. “Amazon has done the best work from a commercial perspective. They took it out of the theoretical to put it to work for things people want to do.” Samsung has also promoted Bixby as a remote hub for connected devices, which is another challenge as it takes the software beyond the smartphone. Samsung unveils new flagship smartphone Galaxy S8 Patrick Moorhead, analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy, said Bixby’s success in the connected home may depend on how much data it can collect. “Machine learning gets better the more training it gets and the more data it gets,” Moorhead said. While Bixby cannot benefit from the large databases of competitors Apple and Windows, it could potentially sync with Samsung electronics and smart home appliances through Samsung’s SmartThings platform. “Samsung ships so many devices from phones to Chromebooks to washing machines, it is picking up a different set of information, so it might end up being smarter than Siri,” he said. “Siri doesn’t know what’s in your refrigerator, Samsung does.” The app faces an uphill battle in a fragmented market where competing platforms don’t always work together. Moorhead said tech companies are jockeying for a position in order to “get access to data — by using this interface they can build detailed profiles on you.” Read more: Artificial Intelligence , Bixby , Samsung Read full story Recommended Stories Google, Amazon eye Toshiba's chip unit: report Toshiba has reportedly completed the first round of bidding for its prized memory chip business Trump has finally replaced his 'unsecure' android device Trump's decision to transition from his Android device is positive for security, but still a target for hackers Samsung store catches fire day before Galaxy S8 launch A fire broke out at the storeroom of Samsung Experience Store in AMK Hub Samsung plans to sell refurbished Galaxy Note 7s Company also plans to recover and use or sell reusable components such as chips and camera modules Facebook Conversations Leave Your Reply Below Click here to cancel reply.

Google risks losing an estimated $750 million in revenue from the debacle. YouTube flap shows Google’s AI still has ways to go Bloomberg News Apr 2, 2017 (…) THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Several major marketers halted YouTube spending this month after ads from large brands were found running alongside hateful videos. Google risks losing an estimated $750 million in revenue from the debacle. An advertiser boycott of YouTube is testing a critical and much-hyped part of Google’s future: its prowess in artificial intelligence. Some experts in the field say the technology isn’t up to scratch yet, but that if any company can solve the problem at hand, it’s the online search giant. Some of the world’s biggest marketers halted YouTube spending this month after ads from large brands were found running alongside hateful and extremist videos. Google parent Alphabet Inc. risks losing $750 million in revenue this year from the debacle, analysts at Nomura Instinet estimated this week. That’s less than 1 percent of projected sales this year, so it can weather the financial storm. But it’s likely an incentive for the company to redirect AI investments and accelerate research efforts already underway. To detect and police content across YouTube’s sprawling library, and ensure ads don’t run against questionable content, Google must solve an AI problem no one has cracked yet: automatically understanding everything that’s going on in videos, including gesticulations and other human nuances. A potential solution lies in machine learning, a powerful AI technique for automatically recognizing patterns across reams of data — a Google specialty. CEO Sundar Pichai has pledged to infuse the technology across all its products, and the company touts its abilities in the field to software developers, cloud-computing clients, advertisers and shareholders. Computer scientists doubt technology alone can expunge offensive videos. “We’re not there yet where we can, say, find all extremist content,” said Hany Farid, a Dartmouth professor and senior adviser to the Counter Extremism Project, which has repeatedly called on YouTube to tackle this problem. He recommends companies like Google and Facebook Inc. deploy more human editors to filter content. “Machine learning, AI is nowhere near that yet,” he said. “Don’t believe the hype.” The AI hype machine is running at full speed in Silicon Valley right now, as startups and technology giants like Google, Amazon and Microsoft compete to recruit engineers and scientists skilled in the field. Google’s AI advances sometimes match the hype, but they are not perfect. The company’s cloud division recently released a tool (unrelated to YouTube) that breaks videos into their constituent parts, rendering them “searchable and discoverable.” A group of academics published research earlier this week that showed how to deceive this system by injecting images into videos. Google has used machine learning and other AI tools to master speech, text and image recognition. In 2012, researchers famously got a network of 16,000 computers to teach itself to recognize cats by scanning millions of still images culled from YouTube videos. Understanding entire videos is a lot more difficult. Cats meow, stretch and jump through more than a thousand video frames each minute. “A video is three-dimensional, with two dimensions in space and an additional dimension in time,” said Jiebo Luo, an AI expert at the University of Rochester, who has created text-based hate speech filters for social media like Twitter. “It’s a challenge.” Particularly so for something as big as YouTube. It said in 2015 that people uploaded 300 hours of content per minute to the service, making it impossible to screen all videos as they appear. Two years have passed, so could software now evolve to a point where it dissects every video uploaded online, deciphering the vile from the rest? “It’s possible,” said Luo, “especially given the massive computational and people resources that Google has. No other company is in a better position to do that.” Still, it’s not cheap. Video demands advanced algorithms and computing horsepower. Today, the industry relies on specialized semiconductors, called graphic processing units, to drive the software. Processing an hour of video typically occupies half the resources of a GPU, said Reza Zadeh, founder of Matroid, an AI startup working on video. A graphics card featuring a high-end chip from market leader Nvidia Corp. sells for about $500. “The best models are expensive right now,” Zadeh said. Google spends billions of dollars a year on data centers, computer servers and the chips that run them. It doesn’t say how much of this goes toward YouTube, but the video site is known to be expensive to run. In AI, Google has even developed its own hardware, called TensorFlow Processing Units. It recently offered a $30,000 prize for researchers to use its cloud and TPUs, or similar AI tools, to accurately label YouTube videos. Google researchers have applied machine learning software to classify images and audio inside videos for years (is that video tagged as a Prince song really Prince?), while improving recommendations and ad performance. Another part of Alphabet — a group called Jigsaw — is using AI tools in other ways to curb hate speech online. In a memo to aggrieved YouTube advertisers last week, the company said its machine-learning algorithms will improve the precision and classification of videos. However, it also warned that with the volume of content involved, this can never be 100 percent guaranteed. Classifying what we hear and watch online, together at once, “is a problem that is essentially open,” Zadeh said. “Probably, Google is doing it right now.” He’s probably right. At a conference Google hosted in February, Jeff Dean, head of Google’s “Brain” AI research unit, spoke about his team’s advances. “The next big domain is video,” he said.

Latest Business Technology Artificial Intelligence VR/AR Autonomous Vehicles Graphene Financial Glossary Latest Business Technology Artificial Intelligence VR/AR Autonomous Vehicles Graphene Financial Glossary Google paid £36.4million in UK corporation tax last year Google paid £36.4million in UK corporation tax last year April 2, 2017, 6:57 AM BST | Written by Joseph Nordqvist | US tech giant Google paid £36.4million in UK corporation tax last year on UK sales of £1.03bn and a pre-tax profit of £149m in the 12 months to the end of June 2016, according to its latest accounts. Tech firms have been under pressure over their tax arrangements, especially Google. Despite the figure being higher than what it has paid in the past, Labour says that Google is still not paying its “fair share” of tax in the UK. Google has faced a lot of pressure to pay a “fairer” share of tax in the UK. Whilst the firm’s accounts reveal that it generated £148.8million of pre-tax profits in the UK on revenues of £1billion, recent accounts filed by Google’s parent company, Alphabet, in the US show UK sales of more than £6bn. This discrepancy comes to business from British customers buying advertising space which is channeled through Google’s European headquarters in Ireland. John Cullinane, of the Chartered Institute of Taxation, was quoted by The Daily Mail as saying: “The amount of corporation tax Google pays in the UK is not based on the amount of profit Google makes from its sales to UK customers. “If it were, Google would be paying about ten times as much – probably about £300million.” “There are big swings and roundabouts. That’s just how things work.” A Google spokesman said: “As an international business, we pay the majority of our taxes in our home country, as well as all the taxes due in the UK. “We have recently announced significant new investment in the UK, including new offices in Kings Cross for 7,000 staff.” abour’s John McDonnell said the latest figures showed Google was still not paying enough tax. He said: “It is a national disgrace that by paying just £36m in tax Google could have an effective tax rate lower than many working families in our country. “And it exposes the complacency at the heart of this Tory government, which is allowing this to still continue despite last year’s scandal.” He added: “It seems that the so-called ‘successful’ tax deal with Google that George Osborne boasted about last year has meant that they are still not paying their fair share under his successor Philip Hammond.” Meg Hillier MP, chair of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), was quoted by the BBC as saying: “Yet again we see a large corporation paying a rate of tax that belies its significant presence and business transactions in the UK. “This is why the PAC is working internationally to press for greater tax transparency so that we can all see clearly how much tax corporations pay and where. She added: “There is already strong international support and growing collaboration for changing the way tax is reported by multinationals. “This latest tax contribution from Google just underlines why this is so important.” Share this article: Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Print No part of this website or any of its contents may be reproduced, copied, or modified, without prior consent, unless otherwise indicated for stand-alone materials.

Some blogs are destined to fail even before they are launched while others never earn past a ceiling of a few hundred dollars - that's even if they manage to earn a hundred dollars per month. The two most common niches with Nigerian bloggers are entertainment and technology, which are already too saturated. Most bloggers also target their blogs at a Nigerian audience and never think of going international, which would make them more money and recognition. 1 Like Re: Uncommon Ways To Make Money Blogging by Revolva(m): 9:27am On Apr 02 google has finnally banned my blog...no adsense will ever show on it....shame on dem...dem papa well pls some one help me with a good adnetwork plsss dat can alloe me ...my blogs is in my signature Re: Uncommon Ways To Make Money Blogging by lakes99: 10:13am On Apr 02 tetula123: all ye that commented before me... what shall it profit a man to miss church so as to wait for 7:am when topics are pushed to FP.

Google always does a great job, from the Pokemon Google Maps overlay to a smart mailbox, but there are a few from other companies worth mentioning. Here's a rundown of all the hillarious (or strange) tech-related April Fools Day jokes from around the web. Google Gnome One of Google's product launches from last year was the Google Home, a $129 smart speaker with Google Assistant. Now the company is teasing the "Google Gnome," an outside version of the Home. You can ask it weather questions, let it control your lawnmower and other tools, and even dress it up in accessories. The Google Gnome has a page on the Google Store, but unfortunately you can't buy it. I really want a rain coat for my Google Home, though. Mrs. Pac-Man in Google Maps For April Fools' 2015, Google added Pac-Man into Google Maps and Ingress. This year, Mrs Pac-Man is invading Google Maps. For regions of the world already on April 1st, a new Mrs. Pac-Man button is visible on the mobile app. You then have to control Mrs. Pac-Man on real-life streets, and of course, outrun the Ghosts. Google's Bubble Wrap Keyboard (English subtitles are available) Google Japan's prank is pretty funny - it's a bubble wrap keyboard. The idea is to pop bubbles on a bubble wrap sheet to form words, then feed the sheet through a reader to send the message. Some of the bubble wrap sheets are even scented. Google Assistant Google has plenty of Easter Eggs in Google Assistant, and as you might expect, there's one for April Fools' Day too. When asked, Assistant will offer advice on how not to get pranked, such as "If something seems too good to be true today, it probably is." Google Wind Google's Netherlands division has its own April Fools' Day gag, named 'Google Wind.' The idea is to use machine learning to control the weather, using Holland's famous windmills. I'll admit, this one is pretty great. Netflix Live Will Arnet has been in plenty of Netflix original content, from BoJack Horseman to A Series of Unfortunate Events. For April Fools' Day, Netflix is proud to share 'Netflix Live', which is nearly an hour of Arnett commentating ordinary events like toasting bread and completing a crossword puzzle. It's actually funnier than it sounds. You can watch the full thing here (a Netflix subscription is required). T-Mobile ONEsie T-Mobile's prank is a onesie, with "full-body coverage" and a built-in 4G LTE hotspot. You can actually buy it for $40, but the real one doesn't have any tech inside it. Hulu Hu With the claim that the human attention span has "dropped to eight seconds," Hulu has released 'Hu.' It's just a library of short clips from existing Hulu content, and you actually need an account to see them. This is probably the lamest April Fools' Day gag in the list - better luck next year, guys. OnePlus Dash drink OnePlus is really proud of its Dash Charge feature, even to the point of enlisting celebrities to talk about it. For April Fools', the company made real Dash Charge energy drinks. You can find our review of the drink here. Lyft Mono For April Fools' Day, Lyft has announced the 'Lyft Mono.' It's a wearable glove, vaguely resembling a Nintendo Power Glove. This gag is actually real, and once you put it on and get the app, sticking out your thumb will hail a Lyft cab. You can sign up to for a chance to get one here. Honor BFF We all need some positive reinforcement every now and then, right? Honor thinks so, and created the Honor BFF. This imaginary phone uses machine learning to periodically give you compliments and motivation. Hopefully it ships with Android 7.1 Nougat. Google Haptic Helpers This is probably my favorite gag so far. In order to create a more realistic virtual reality experience, you can schedule a "haptic helper" to come to your house and help create a more realistic environment. Just watch the video, it's hilarious. Amazon Petlexa Alexa is cool and all, but your furry friends need one too. As the name implies, Petlexa is Alexa for your pets. Contour by SlickWraps Putting a skin on your phone or tablet is too much work. For April Fool's Day, Slickwraps is teasing the 'Countour' - a machine that sprays on device skins. Frankly, I'm not sure if this is actually real or not, but there is a page for it on SlickWrap's store. Nvidia GTX G-Assist How many times have you been playing an online game, only to be interrupted by someone in real life? NVIDIA has made the 'G Assist,' a flash drive that can take over for you if you're busy. It can also help you beat boss battles, and provides periodic reminders to consume energy drinks. More information and a video can be found here. Google's data center on Mars If you have important data, you need a backup. That's why Google announced its first interplanetary data center, named "Ziggy Stardust," on the Google Cloud Platform Blog today. Located in the Gale Crater on Mars, it will store a cache of data from Earth to prevent irrecoverable loss when a planetary disaster strikes. Google hopes to finish the data center by 2018. LineageOS' mascot CyanogenMod's mascot, Cid, was one of the most recognizable icons in the Android community. As the spiritual successor to CyanogenMod, LineageOS has created its own mascot - 'Ink'. The project also announced 'Br0zip,' an artificial intelligence that can port LineageOS to any device in no time at all. Chromebook accessories Even though most Chromebooks can now run Android apps, you still can't use your Chromebook like an Android phone/tablet for all use cases. Until now, that is. Google has announced a Chromebook Groupie Stick (seen above), a Chromebook Cardboard headset, and a Chromebook armband. See the company's blog post for more info. Exynos Yoga Processor Remember when curved phones were a thing? Maybe we'll see more in the coming months, because Samsung has just unveiled the Exynos Yoga Processor - the first flexible mobile SoC. Anyone up for a Galaxy Flex? Carved screen protector Carved is a small Indiana-based phone case company, but now they are working on a wooden screen protector. Why hasn't this been done before? I'll take ten. I'm Feeling Woof/I'm Feeling Meow By force-touching the Google app icon in iOS, you can select "I'm Feeling Woof" or "I'm Feeling Meow." These give your pets access to the stuff they care about - from dog food to balls of yarn. More info can be found on Google's blog post. Waze maps for Mars According to the company's blog, Waze is has begun to map the surface of Mars. Certain members of the Waze community will also be sent to the Red Planet to more accurately map the surface. JerryRigEverything's NoPhone video If you haven't heard about it, the NoPhone is a solid piece of plastic designed to simulate the feeling of a phone in your pocket. I'm not really sure if anyone uses it, but JerryRigEverything is happy to break it just as much as any other phone. Google Translate for Heptapod B Using machine learning, Google Translate can now decrypt messages written in Heptapod B - the language from the film Arrival. On an unrelated note, it looks like someone from Google is still rocking a Nexus 10. See Google's blog post for more info. Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s ASUS has an April Fools gag too - the Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s Veritas Blue Limited Special Edition. I would probably buy this phone. MKBHD's Nokia 3310 review You may have heard about the updated Nokia 3310, but it turns out the original is an amazing smartphone. Okay, maybe not, but the video is pretty funny. Open GApps Femto Do you need to flash the latest Gapps package on your device, but you don't have a stable network connection? Not to worry, the Open GApps Femto package is here to help. It uses the United States HAARP service (which is not real, but just pretend) to download the latest GApps package. You can find more info at the GApps blog.   That concludes our coverage of April Fools' Day in the tech world. Let us know in the comments below which gag you liked the most!

Yeah they actuqally had me going until I compared a whois of kodi.tv vs kickasstorrents.com, a site that actually was seized. The whois data would show that it is not official.

All they'd need to do is add a battery (and Qi charging) to a Google Home and stick it in a new Gnome shell... Make sure its IP68 and maybe even MIL-STD-810G certified. It'd be a fun little gadget to put on the picnic table of your next summer back yard get together. Pump out some tunes, order pizza & Ubers for everyone to go home in, etc... Or take out when you work in the garden & don't want to get your phone dirty... Maybe even produce one with an LTE radio (and GPS). Then you could take it out of WiFi range camping.

Bixby — introduced at Samsung’s unveiling of Galaxy S8 smartphones — aims to help the South Korean giant break into a surging market for voice-activated virtual assistants, which includes Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, Google’s Assistant and Microsoft’s Cortana. The latest personal digital assistant distinguishes itself from competitors by using voice commands rather than touch to control handsets or applications, factoring in location awareness and image recognition. The integrated camera function allows users to identify buildings, such as popular tourist sites, to access their websites and other information simply by snapping a photo. The photo recognition technology can also help users decipher menus in foreign languages, or find places to shop for specific items they photograph. “It impressed me that they were doing image recognition and context awareness,” said Bob O’Donnell, analyst and consultant with Technalysis Research, who attended the presentation. “It adds some new twists we haven’t seen before,” he said, noting Bixby’s ability to make recommendations. Yet Bixby is still a work in progress — the virtual entity did not speak at the New York demonstration. It has yet to be infused with technology from Samsung’s recently acquired Viv, a company founded by creators of Apple’s Siri. “It’s not talking yet,” O’Donnell said. “They have room to expand and grow.” Bixby will face competition from established players — even from Samsung’s own phones, where users can choose to use Assistant, Cortana or Alexa. Richard Windsor, an independent analyst who writes the Radio Free Mobile blog, said Bixby may face problems because the “best-in-class Google Assistant” will be on the home button of the new phone, which is powered by Google-backed Android software. That means Bixby has a “fearsome competitor” on its own flagship device, according to the analyst. “Bixby is trying to do things a little differently but careful assessment of what Samsung demonstrated shows a service that has very little intelligence at all,” Windsor said. Roger Kay of Endpoint Technologies Associates said Bixby might face challenges catching up with its rivals, which have been deployed for some time. “You can’t build these things overnight,” Kay said. “It would take years to create something as developed as Siri.” Still, he noted, it is important for Samsung to be in the game. “These are table stakes,” Kay said. “You can’t not deal with voice. It’s hands-free and can summarize a lot of things quickly.” Amazon appears to have impacted the sector the most with its connected speakers using Alexa. The service allows users a wide range of voice interactions for music, news, purchases and connects with smart home devices. “Alexa is the top dog,” Kay said. “Amazon has done the best work from a commercial perspective.

Related Samsung launches Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus with voice-assistant tech Bixby Move over, Siri! Bixby voice-assistant to debut with Samsung Galaxy S8 smartphone WASHINGTON: Samsung's Bixby is the new kid on the block of personal digital assistants and is likely to face a rough reception in a neighborhood dominated by tech sector rivals. Bixby -- introduced at Samsung's unveiling of Galaxy S8 smartphones -- aims to help the South Korean giant break into a surging market for voice-activated virtual assistants, which includes Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, Google's Assistant and Microsoft's Cortana. The latest personal digital assistant distinguishes itself from competitors by using voice commands rather than touch to control handsets or applications, factoring in location awareness and image recognition. The integrated camera function allows users to identify buildings, such as popular tourist sites, to access their websites and other information simply by snapping a photo. The photo recognition technology can also help users decipher menus in foreign languages, or find places to shop for specific items they photograph. "It impressed me that they were doing image recognition and context awareness," said Bob O'Donnell, analyst and consultant with Technalysis Research, who attended the presentation. "It adds some new twists we haven't seen before," he said, noting Bixby's ability to make recommendations. Yet Bixby is still a work in progress -- the virtual entity did not speak at the New York demonstration. It has yet to be infused with technology from Samsung's recently acquired Viv, a company founded by creators of Apple's Siri. "It's not talking yet," O'Donnell said. "They have room to expand and grow." Bixby will face competition from established players -- even from Samsung's own phones, where users can choose to use Assistant, Cortana or Alexa. Richard Windsor, an independent analyst who writes the Radio Free Mobile blog, said Bixby may face problems because the "best-in-class Google Assistant" will be on the home button of the new phone, which is powered by Google-backed Android software. That means Bixby has a "fearsome competitor" on its own flagship device, according to the analyst. "Bixby is trying to do things a little differently but careful assessment of what Samsung demonstrated shows a service that has very little intelligence at all," Windsor said. Roger Kay of Endpoint Technologies Associates said Bixby might face challenges catching up with its rivals, which have been deployed for some time. "You can't build these things overnight," Kay said. "It would take years to create something as developed as Siri." Still, he noted, it is important for Samsung to be in the game. "These are table stakes," Kay said. "You can't not deal with voice. It's hands-free and can summarize a lot of things quickly." Amazon appears to have impacted the sector the most with its connected speakers using Alexa. The service allows users a wide range of voice interactions for music, news, purchases and connects with smart home devices. "Alexa is the top dog," Kay said. "Amazon has done the best work from a commercial perspective. They took it out of the theoretical to put it to work for things people want to do." Want stories like this in your inbox?

Now in an announcement by Logitech, it seems that if you own the company’s Harmony devices like the Harmony Elite, Harmony Companion, or the Harmony Hub, it will work with Google Home and Google Assistant. This means that using your voice, you will be able to get Google Home/Assistant to do certain Harmony-specific tasks. According to Logitech, “Any Logitech Harmony hub-based product including Harmony Elite, Harmony Companion, and Harmony Hub works with the Google Assistant on Google Home by allowing you to easily power on the TV, control the volume, or change channels simply by using your voice. You can also activate your favorite Harmony activity, turn on smart lighting, or control up to 270,000 other devices supported by the Logitech Harmony platform.” Some examples include turning on your TV to a specific channel, or adjusting the volume, or adjust and control your smart lighting system like the Philips Hue system. If you’d like more details on the features and how to set it up, head on over to Logitech’s website. Filed in Gadgets >Home. Read more about Google, google assistant, google home and Logitech.

Google always does a great job, from the Pokemon Google Maps overlay to a smart mailbox, but there are a few from other companies worth mentioning. Here's a rundown of all the hillarious (or strange) tech-related April Fools Day jokes from around the web. Google Gnome One of Google's product launches from last year was the Google Home, a $129 smart speaker with Google Assistant. Now the company is teasing the "Google Gnome," an outside version of the Home. You can ask it weather questions, let it control your lawnmower and other tools, and even dress it up in accessories. The Google Gnome has a page on the Google Store, but unfortunately you can't buy it. I really want a rain coat for my Google Home, though. Mrs. Pac-Man in Google Maps For April Fools' 2015, Google added Pac-Man into Google Maps and Ingress. This year, Mrs Pac-Man is invading Google Maps. For regions of the world already on April 1st, a new Mrs. Pac-Man button is visible on the mobile app. You then have to control Mrs. Pac-Man on real-life streets, and of course, outrun the Ghosts. Google's Bubble Wrap Keyboard (English subtitles are available) Google Japan's prank is pretty funny - it's a bubble wrap keyboard. The idea is to pop bubbles on a bubble wrap sheet to form words, then feed the sheet through a reader to send the message. Some of the bubble wrap sheets are even scented. Google Assistant Google has plenty of Easter Eggs in Google Assistant, and as you might expect, there's one for April Fools' Day too. When asked, Assistant will offer advice on how not to get pranked, such as "If something seems too good to be true today, it probably is." Google Wind Google's Netherlands division has its own April Fools' Day gag, named 'Google Wind.' The idea is to use machine learning to control the weather, using Holland's famous windmills. I'll admit, this one is pretty great. Netflix Live Will Arnet has been in plenty of Netflix original content, from BoJack Horseman to A Series of Unfortunate Events. For April Fools' Day, Netflix is proud to share 'Netflix Live', which is nearly an hour of Arnett commentating ordinary events like toasting bread and completing a crossword puzzle. It's actually funnier than it sounds. You can watch the full thing here (a Netflix subscription is required). T-Mobile ONEsie T-Mobile's prank is a onesie, with "full-body coverage" and a built-in 4G LTE hotspot. You can actually buy it for $40, but the real one doesn't have any tech inside it. Hulu Hu With the claim that the human attention span has "dropped to eight seconds," Hulu has released 'Hu.' It's just a library of short clips from existing Hulu content, and you actually need an account to see them. This is probably the lamest April Fools' Day gag in the list - better luck next year, guys. OnePlus Dash drink OnePlus is really proud of its Dash Charge feature, even to the point of enlisting celebrities to talk about it. For April Fools', the company made real Dash Charge energy drinks. You can find our review of the drink here. Lyft Mono For April Fools' Day, Lyft has announced the 'Lyft Mono.' It's a wearable glove, vaguely resembling a Nintendo Power Glove. This gag is actually real, and once you put it on and get the app, sticking out your thumb will hail a Lyft cab. You can sign up to for a chance to get one here. Honor BFF We all need some positive reinforcement every now and then, right? Honor thinks so, and created the Honor BFF. This imaginary phone uses machine learning to periodically give you compliments and motivation. Hopefully it ships with Android 7.1 Nougat. Google Haptic Helpers This is probably my favorite gag so far. In order to create a more realistic virtual reality experience, you can schedule a "haptic helper" to come to your house and help create a more realistic environment. Just watch the video, it's hilarious. Amazon Petlexa Alexa is cool and all, but your furry friends need one too. As the name implies, Petlexa is Alexa for your pets. Contour by SlickWraps Putting a skin on your phone or tablet is too much work. For April Fool's Day, Slickwraps is teasing the 'Countour' - a machine that sprays on device skins. Frankly, I'm not sure if this is actually real or not, but there is a page for it on SlickWrap's store. Nvidia GTX G-Assist How many times have you been playing an online game, only to be interrupted by someone in real life? NVIDIA has made the 'G Assist,' a flash drive that can take over for you if you're busy. It can also help you beat boss battles, and provides periodic reminders to consume energy drinks. More information and a video can be found here. Google's data center on Mars If you have important data, you need a backup. That's why Google announced its first interplanetary data center, named "Ziggy Stardust," on the Google Cloud Platform Blog today. Located in the Gale Crater on Mars, it will store a cache of data from Earth to prevent irrecoverable loss when a planetary disaster strikes. Google hopes to finish the data center by 2018. LineageOS' mascot CyanogenMod's mascot, Cid, was one of the most recognizable icons in the Android community. As the spiritual successor to CyanogenMod, LineageOS has created its own mascot - 'Ink'. The project also announced 'Br0zip,' an artificial intelligence that can port LineageOS to any device in no time at all. Chromebook accessories Even though most Chromebooks can now run Android apps, you still can't use your Chromebook like an Android phone/tablet for all use cases. Until now, that is. Google has announced a Chromebook Groupie Stick (seen above), a Chromebook Cardboard headset, and a Chromebook armband. See the company's blog post for more info. Exynos Yoga Processor Remember when curved phones were a thing? Maybe we'll see more in the coming months, because Samsung has just unveiled the Exynos Yoga Processor - the first flexible mobile SoC. Anyone up for a Galaxy Flex? Carved screen protector Carved is a small Indiana-based phone case company, but now they are working on a wooden screen protector. Why hasn't this been done before? I'll take ten. I'm Feeling Woof/I'm Feeling Meow By force-touching the Google app icon in iOS, you can select "I'm Feeling Woof" or "I'm Feeling Meow." These give your pets access to the stuff they care about - from dog food to balls of yarn. More info can be found on Google's blog post. Waze maps for Mars According to the company's blog, Waze is has begun to map the surface of Mars. Certain members of the Waze community will also be sent to the Red Planet to more accurately map the surface. JerryRigEverything's NoPhone video If you haven't heard about it, the NoPhone is a solid piece of plastic designed to simulate the feeling of a phone in your pocket. I'm not really sure if anyone uses it, but JerryRigEverything is happy to break it just as much as any other phone. Google Translate for Heptapod B Using machine learning, Google Translate can now decrypt messages written in Heptapod B - the language from the film Arrival. On an unrelated note, it looks like someone from Google is still rocking a Nexus 10. See Google's blog post for more info. Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s ASUS has an April Fools gag too - the Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s Veritas Blue Limited Special Edition. I would probably buy this phone. MKBHD's Nokia 3310 review You may have heard about the updated Nokia 3310, but it turns out the original is an amazing smartphone. Okay, maybe not, but the video is pretty funny. Open GApps Femto Do you need to flash the latest Gapps package on your device, but you don't have a stable network connection? Not to worry, the Open GApps Femto package is here to help. It uses the United States HAARP service (which is not real, but just pretend) to download the latest GApps package. You can find more info at the GApps blog.   That concludes our coverage of April Fools' Day in the tech world. Let us know in the comments below which gag you liked the most!

Yeah they actuqally had me going until I compared a whois of kodi.tv vs kickasstorrents.com, a site that actually was seized. The whois data would show that it is not official. Derik Taylor So this is one I find interesting. Could it technically be a criminal offense to falsify a domain seizure? How would that work? Greg Abbott Doubt it, technically a website isn't an official document. mondeca I hope every year that Google will announce something real and awesome on April Fools' Day, like they did with Gmail.

Corbin Davenport Yep, that had me laughing too. AdrianFDiratama . How about JG I'd actually like to see Google produce the Google Gnome.... All they'd need to do is add a battery (and Qi charging) to a Google Home and stick it in a new Gnome shell... Make sure its IP68 and maybe even MIL-STD-810G certified. It'd be a fun little gadget to put on the picnic table of your next summer back yard get together. Pump out some tunes, order pizza & Ubers for everyone to go home in, etc... Or take out when you work in the garden & don't want to get your phone dirty... Maybe even produce one with an LTE radio (and GPS). Then you could take it out of WiFi range camping.

How far away from the camp site is it?" cdotlawrence Maybe like a more customizable (from a looks standpoint), durable, & usable-on-go version of Home? Google Home Pro/Ultra? Interesting idea, but not sure why you wouldn't do most of the things it would do on your phone. Some specific use cases like you mentioned but beyond those, idk. Guess it'd be a highly functional, portable, durable and customizable speaker? Suicide_Note Ms. Pac-Man in Maps is live for me here in the US, even though it isn't April 1st yet.

Sections Deseret NewsUtah Utah Google Fiber installation moving at dial-up speeds in Salt Lake City By Art RaymondDeseret News Published: April 1, 2017 8:25 p.m. Updated: 6 hours ago 1 Comment 1 of 5 View 5 Items Jeffrey D. Allred, Deseret News Antonio Lenrmi does preparation work for Google Fiber on 2300 East and 2300 South in Sugar House on Tuesday, March 28, 2017. SALT LAKE CITY — A couple of springs ago, Google — amid much pomp and fanfare — announced that Salt Lake City had been distinguished from a long list of hopeful American cities to become recipients of Google Fiber service and that dizzying download speeds were just around the corner. The world's largest corporation also applied the gilding to the lily in promising that all would be accomplished completely at their expense. Now, just over two years later, progress on the project appears to be moving at dial-up speeds, with relatively few areas of the city enjoying active, Google Fiber service and a small number of residents feeling less than giddy about their interactions with the company. And the downside to the privately funded effort is that the company has zero obligation to keep residents informed about future installations, follow-through on promised scheduling or answer questions from the media. Google declined to provide specific information about how many Salt Lake residents currently have service, in what order the city's neighborhoods would be receiving service or how long it will take to complete the work of establishing access to Google Fiber service citywide. Last fall, Google made its second public splash, announcing that the major infrastructure "ring" had been completed and a section of downtown was fully wired and providing service to residents who signed up for it. The company also said it was prepared to move quickly to get the city's remaining neighborhoods connected and whetted residents' appetites with impressive public demonstrations of the power of fiber, like downloading a full-length HD movie in a matter of seconds. Sugar House Community Council Chairman Landon Clark said a Google representative visited a meeting of his council about a year before the announcement and indicated his neighborhood would be seeing service in the summer of 2016. "Obviously, they were far behind their hoped-for schedule," Clark said. "But while a lot of people have experienced some frustration with the delays, they've been working in our area for several weeks now and people are excited about getting hooked up to fiber service," he added. When asked for details about exactly where Google Fiber service is currently available to Salt Lake residents, a company spokesperson sent coordinates that mirrored the service area announced last fall and a statement that they were "actively constructing, signing up and providing service" in Sugar House. Clark said it seemed like a "pretty good section" of Sugar House's residential areas either had service or had seen recent signs of cabling activity. Rose Park While no active service appears to be currently available to Rose Park residents, there's been plenty of fiber-related activity in the area and, for some residents, just a bit too much installation action. David Parrott was happy to see signs of Google Fiber being installed in and around his Rose Park neighborhood last fall, shortly after the company's announcement of initial service to downtown residents. "It seems like the west side is usually last on the list to get the cool, new stuff that comes to Salt Lake City, so we were definitely excited to see that, for a change, we were going to be among the first (to get fiber service)," Parrott said. Later, that enthusiasm took a turn following an unexpected encounter between a subcontractor's underground drill and his residential water line. While a drilling crew was nearby, the running water in his house "just stopped." Parrott said the workers from Mile High Contracting acknowledged they had severed the water line, but when asked when they would be able to repair the damage, the contractor gave an unexpected response. "Google's subcontractor told us it wasn't their problem and that we should contact our home insurer," Parrott said. "We were really surprised and just thought, 'This is kind of weird.'" Parrott said he contacted HomeServe, the company through which they had supplemental insurance for their outside water line. "The company denied our claim and told us that they'd heard from other people with coverage in our area with similar issues," Parrott said. "And they said it was Google's responsibility." With no working water service and no one ready to take responsibility for the damage, Parrott said they turned to the city for help, contacting both their council representative and a person they knew in the mayor's office. That finally got the repair effort moving. "Someone from the city came out, and someone from Google came out and, eventually, the water line got fixed," Parrott said. At a Rose Park Community Council meeting held after the water line incident, Parrott said he spoke to the audience there, which included a Google representative. "I stood up and related the story of what we'd been through to the Google rep and my neighbors," said Parrott. "And I thought, 'All you have to do now is say we're sorry and it was our fault.'" That didn't happen, and it led Parrott to do some research to determine if their experience was an anomaly, or if there was more going on. "I looked up all the other communities where Google has been and a lot of them had the same treatment," said Parrott. "In every single municipality where they put Google Fiber, there are news stories about how badly the installation has gone." Tennessee's capital city, Nashville was about 15 months into its Google Fiber installation last fall, and according to a story published in November in The Tennessean, over 70 "utility strikes" had occurred, with an estimated damage value in excess of $260,000. The Salt Lake Public Utilities Department was asked about the total number of fiber installation-related utility strikes in Salt Lake City, but wasn't able to offer complete data in time for this story. District 1 Councilman James Rogers said he's heard from a few residents in his district who have had issues with property damage related to the Google Fiber installation effort, but it was his impression that the company was getting better at taking care of needed repairs. “Of course it’s unfortunate that it happened and I feel for those individuals that have had issues," Rogers said. "But, if we can get them resolved and everybody’s happy with how it’s fixed, I think in the long run it’s going to be a good thing for us.” Xmission founder and CEO Pete Ashdown has been a cautionary voice about Google Fiber coming to Salt Lake City since the company's debut announcement in 2015. He said he wasn't surprised that the installation job is behind schedule. "Installing fiber optic cable is fraught with peril," Ashdown said. "You can always count on it being expensive and you can always count on it taking longer than you ever think it will." Ashdown said he was surprised that Google wasn't more dialed-in on the process, considering its experience with other, so-called "Google Fiber cities" and the breadth of knowledge that's out there in the contracting community where fiber cable installation has been active since the 1990s. "You’d think a company with the resources of Google could be brash about getting out there and doing it quickly," Ashdown said. "They seem to be surprised at how much money it’s costing and how long it's taking, which is incredible because it’s (fiber cable installation) been going on for decades." And while Google will offer no estimate on when it might cross the fiber installation finish line in Salt Lake City, some sense of timeline may be gleaned from Kansas City. The company's first municipal fiber project was announced in 2011 with installation starting the following year. The city has about three times the population of Salt Lake City and, as of now, some Kansas City residents are still awaiting fiber service in their neighborhoods. Positive reviews While the road to fiber installation in Salt Lake City has been bumpy, reviews from those who have the service are very positive. Downtown Community Council Chairman D. Christian Harrison signed up for the 100 megabit-per-second service (fast enough to download a full-length HD movie in about 6 minutes, according to Google) and said he couldn't be happier with the experience. "I signed up immediately and was in the first wave of folks who got service," Harrison said. "The installation went smoothly and suddenly I had speeds far faster than I've ever had." He did offer one minor caveat about the "box" that is installed in customer homes who sign up for the service. "Really, the only complaint I have is the hardware we have to deal with," Harrison said. "It's unwieldy, it's unattractive and it's in the middle of my living room." Harrison noted that even though there's an even faster level of service available, 1,000-megabits-per-second (a gigabit), he couldn't imagine needing it. Prices for Salt Lake customers start at $50 a month for the Fiber 100 (100 Mbps) and go up from there. A gigabit will cost you $70 a month and Google also offers add-ons like fiber TV for an additional $90 a month, fiber phone for $10 a month or an entertainment package (with streaming services like Spotify Premium) for $15 a month. 1 comment on this story An informal survey of the city's community groups reflect that, at the moment, besides the already serviced downtown area, only Sugar House and Rose Park have active Google Fiber installation happening in residential areas. The East Bench and East Liberty Wells councils have had recent visits from Google reps and Fairpark Community Council was told the area would be seeing service near the end of the year. In recent months, Google has scaled back its previously reported expansion of Google Fiber service to other U.S. cities, but has been unwavering in reassurances that the Salt Lake project will be seen through to completion. In a statement shared with the Deseret News, the company wrote: "Our commitment to SLC remains: build the fastest, most effective and highest quality network in the most efficient and least disruptive way possible."

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > New version of Google Calendar makes the most of… New version of Google Calendar makes the most of the iPad's larger screen By Kyle Wiggers — March 29, 2017 1:06 PM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you If you've been holding out for an iPad-optimized version of Google Calendar, we've got some good news: It's finally here. Better late than never. On Wednesday, Google launched a new version of Google Calendar, its popular web-based planner, for Apple’s iPad. It’s basically like the Google Calendar app for iPhone, but optimized for the iPad’s larger screen. Bigger icons make dragging and dropping calendar appointments a little easier, and enlarged text simplifies the process of adding new appointments. More: Your fitness goals from Google Fit and Apple Health now show up in Google Calendar It’s a little more intuitive, too, than the built-in Calendar app for iOS — especially when it comes to syncing Google Calendars. Normally, syncing multiple Google Calendars requires supplying your Google Credentials to Apple’s Calendar settings, signing into your Google account, and checking the individual boxes beside the calendars you want to sync with your device. With the new Google Calendar for iOS, you only have to sign in once. Otherwise, the new Google Calendar for iPad boasts all of Calendar’s existing features. One of those is Smart Scheduling, which suggests meeting times and available rooms based on participant’s availability and room preferences. Goals, meanwhile, intelligently schedules goals that you want to achieve in the upcoming weeks and months — if you set a goal to go running at 6:30 a.m. every other morning but don’t actually start running until 7:15 a.m., Google will reschedule future events automatically. More: Learn to keep your calendar organized with our best Google-Fu The new Calendar app is built into iOS Spotlight search — you can search for appointments and meetings from the iPad’s home screen. And it ships with a new Today View Widget that shows upcoming events in Notification Center (and in the future, on the lock screen). The release of Calendar for iPad comes on the heels of fitness app integration. In January, Google linked Apple’s Health app and Google’s own Fit to Google Calendar. Fitness goals you’ve scheduled in either show up in Google Calendar, and once you accomplish them, marks the events as done. More: How to sync multiple Google Calendars with your iOS device In April, Google Calendar gained support for reminders on desktop. When you set a reminder with apps like Inbox by Gmail, Google Keep, Google Now, and through the Google Calendar app, it will sync with the web client. Unlike calendar entries, reminders are present until they’re complete, and appear at the top of your calendar each day.
Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Google's updated Search app comes with… Google's updated Search app comes with Gboard, Google's third-party keyboard By Kyle Wiggers — March 29, 2017 2:04 PM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you The new Google Search app with Gboard makes it easier to find emoji, GIFs, and more. Android may be Google’s operating system, but that doesn’t mean the search giant’s ignoring its second-largest market: Apple’s iOS. This week, Google rolled out a string of updates to one of its most popular iPhone products: Search. Starting this week, the Google Search app for iOS now includes Google’s third-party Gboard as part of its download — you will see the option to enable Gboard in the Google app’s settings. More: Google updates iPhone Search app with a smarter Google Now and customized alerts Gboard, Google’s third-party keyboard for iOS, already boasts an impressive number of features. The headlining feature is a built-in Google Search bar that lets you send weather forecasts, videos, images, news, restaurant recommendations, emojis, GIFs, and anything else Google’s servers manage to find. Gboard’s support for glide typing lets you compose replies by swiping a finger across the keyboard (a faster alternative to tapping out the letters individually). And voice transcription’s on board, too. The new Search app for iOS also boasts “Trending on Google,” a widget that features breaking news and other topics based on trending searches across Google. Tapping on an item launches the Google app, so you can read more. Apple’s 3D Touch features heavily in the new update. A 3D Touch on the Search app’s icon surfaces up options to start a voice, image, or incognito search, and a tap on the ‘G’ icon at the bottom of the screen quickly starts a new search.

Two years ago, Google rolled out an update that added conversational voice. Basically, it put voice questions in context — asking, “What’s the weather like?” and immediately following up with, “How about this weekend?” will show results tailored to the second query. Last year, Google rolled out a streamlined Search app that broke results into two categories: Current Topics and Upcoming Events. News, sports, weather, and other topics populated the former and info about calendar appointments and important emails took up the latter.
Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Android apps could rake in more cash than iOS this… Android apps could rake in more cash than iOS this year — but there’s a catch By Adam Ismail — March 29, 2017 2:22 PM Subscribe Share bloomua/123RF Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you With higher revenue numbers, Android could attract even more developer support, potentially leading to higher quality apps and more innovation on the platform. This year is slated to be a pivotal one for app sales, according to a report from App Annie. The analytics firm projects Android app revenue to overtake that of iOS for the first time ever by the end of 2017 — but there’s a catch. Apple’s App Store should pull in $40 billion, by App Annie’s estimation. This would make for an increase of $6 billion over last year’s numbers. Google Play, on its own, is expected to deliver a little more than half that in 2017 — $21 billion. So where’s the other $20 billion coming from? More: Google Play celebrates anniversary with lists of its most popular apps App Annie If you combine Google Play’s revenue with that of other Android app stores, like Amazon’s, Samsung’s, and SlideMe, app spend on the platform could overtake iOS by roughly $1 billion, the report claims. While Google on its own may narrow the gap to Apple over the next five years — App Annie says by 2021, Google could be earning somewhere around $42 billion a year, compared to Apple’s $60 billion — the company will likely continue to lose significant sales to third-party marketplaces for the foreseeable future. What makes Apple’s performance especially impressive is that the company managed less than half the app downloads Google achieved last year — 29 billion to 63 billion, respectively — and still raked in double the sales. App Annie attributes this to Apple’s relatively more affluent customers, but Android could somewhat compensate for this with its more dominant market share worldwide and rapidly growing install base in emerging markets like India, Brazil, and Indonesia. Such markets are expected to play a major role in the growth of the app economy — particularly China, which is beginning to mature. The country far and away leads the rest of the world in terms of downloads, but App Annie sees this trend slowing in the next few years. At the same time, revenue from Chinese users may actually increase. The report predicts China could eventually account for as much as 41 percent of worldwide app spending by 2021.

Bixby — introduced at Samsung’s unveiling of Galaxy S8 smartphones — aims to help the South Korean giant break into a surging market for voice-activated virtual assistants, which includes Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, Google’s Assistant and Microsoft’s Cortana. The latest personal digital assistant distinguishes itself from competitors by using voice commands rather than touch to control handsets or applications, factoring in location awareness and image recognition. The integrated camera function allows users to identify buildings, such as popular tourist sites, to access their websites and other information simply by snapping a photo. The photo recognition technology can also help users decipher menus in foreign languages, or find places to shop for specific items they photograph. “It impressed me that they were doing image recognition and context awareness,” said Bob O’Donnell, analyst and consultant with Technalysis Research, who attended the presentation. “It adds some new twists we haven’t seen before,” he said, noting Bixby’s ability to make recommendations. Yet Bixby is still a work in progress — the virtual entity did not speak at the New York demonstration. It has yet to be infused with technology from Samsung’s recently acquired Viv, a company founded by creators of Apple’s Siri. “It’s not talking yet,” O’Donnell said. “They have room to expand and grow.” Tough competitors Bixby will face competition from established players — even from Samsung’s own phones, where users can choose to use Assistant, Cortana or Alexa. Richard Windsor, an independent analyst who writes the Radio Free Mobile blog, said Bixby may face problems because the “best-in-class Google Assistant” will be on the home button of the new phone, which is powered by Google-backed Android software. That means Bixby has a “fearsome competitor” on its own flagship device, according to the analyst. “Bixby is trying to do things a little differently but careful assessment of what Samsung demonstrated shows a service that has very little intelligence at all,” Windsor said. Roger Kay of Endpoint Technologies Associates said Bixby might face challenges catching up with its rivals, which have been deployed for some time. “You can’t build these things overnight,” Kay said. “It would take years to create something as developed as Siri.” Still, he noted, it is important for Samsung to be in the game. “These are table stakes,” Kay said. “You can’t not deal with voice. It’s hands-free and can summarise a lot of things quickly.” Amazon appears to have impacted the sector the most with its connected speakers using Alexa. The service allows users a wide range of voice interactions for music, news, purchases and connects with smart home devices. “Alexa is the top dog,” Kay said. “Amazon has done the best work from a commercial perspective. They took it out of the theoretical to put it to work for things people want to do.” Beyond the phone Samsung has also promoted Bixby as a remote hub for connected devices, which is another challenge as it takes the software beyond the smartphone. Patrick Moorhead, analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy, said Bixby’s success in the connected home may depend on how much data it can collect. “Machine learning gets better the more training it gets and the more data it gets,” Moorhead said. While Bixby cannot benefit from the large databases of competitors Apple and Windows, it could potentially sync with Samsung electronics and smart home appliances through Samsung’s SmartThings platform. “Samsung ships so many devices from phones to Chromebooks to washing machines, it is picking up a different set of information, so it might end up being smarter than Siri,” he said. “Siri doesn’t know what’s in your refrigerator, Samsung does.” The app faces an uphill battle in a fragmented market where competing platforms don’t always work together. Moorhead said tech companies are jockeying for a position in order to “get access to data — by using this interface they can build detailed profiles on you.” — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Dyson is the Apple of appliances (and just as secretive) Amazon Malaysia to launch late 2017 China’s TCL brings back physical keyboard in new BlackBerry Apple ‘spaceship’ headquarters readies for boarding Google adds new languages, voice dictation to its iPhone keyboard Find the stations with the cheapest petrol with MyPetrol app China’s TCL brings back physical keyboard in new BlackBerry Apple ‘spaceship’ headquarters readies for boarding Google adds new languages, voice dictation to its iPhone keyboard Lazada launches ‘Lovezada’ dating app (VIDEO) Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Star-studded lineup in 'War Machine' Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles Samsung stations the smartphone as a desktop replacement (VIDEO) Samsung faces ‘biggest test’ with Galaxy S8 launch Meet Bixby, Samsung’s new artificial intelligence assistant Samsung Galaxy S8 rumours: Smaller case, more screen real estate Samsung won’t unveil Galaxy S8 smartphone at MWC show Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Speaking at Ad Week Europe last week the former editor-in-chief of the Guardian said media companies should be learning from Facebook and Google. Why? Because the tech giants continue to forge trusted relationships with consumers and gobble up what once was publisher ad revenue. "It's very easy to say Google and Facebook are stealing money. They are and they're awful, but they seem to have a relationship with people at large that the press ought to be thinking about," Rusbridger reportedly said. "We need to rethink how we can build more trust, and at the same time harness the power that exists out there because that's what Google and Facebook are doing." So can publishers plug themselves into the online mainframe like Google and Facebook? And is Rusbridger right to advise media outlets to try to imitate technology firms? Any publisher that wanted to try would need to stop caring so much about content. Facebook and Google have both been at pains to point out that they're not media companies. And while it's a mealy-mouthed line, in many ways, it's also true. They employ algorithms, not editors, create digital products not daily editions. While they certainly have skin in the content game, they are far more focused on engineering. Content may be king, but digital distribution is the kingmaker. Both Facebook and Google have been on the shift to mobile. Mobile ads accounted for 80pc of Facebook's $5.6bn ad revenue in Q4 2016, while Google has split how it indexes the internet, making mobile its primary index. All these efforts are underpinned by massive investment in technology. So if a media company really wanted to do as Alan Rusbridger is suggesting, it would need to start spending heavily on research and development. How heavily? Well, Facebook spent $1,563m in the last quarter of 2016. Google, for its part, has been focused on artificial intelligence - another costly exercise. In 2016 the company launched over 350 products powered by machine learning. Artificial intelligence has been added to search, maps, messaging and Google Translate. It may be artificial but it ain't cheap. Google has acquired 11 AI companies in recent years. One, DeepMind, snapped up in 2014, cost $400m. Publishers that want to follow Google and Facebook's lead not only need to stump up that sort of cash, they also need to start collating monumental amounts of data which can power their machine-learning efforts. Its doubtful that any media company has the data or the deep pockets for this sort of investment. Let's move onto the issue of trust, also raised by Rusbridger. Certainly it's a problem. The 2017 Edelman trust barometer found that trust in media had dropped to 43pc and is at all-time lows in 17 countries. In the US Gallup recently found only 26pc of those aged 18 to 49 said they have a great deal or fair amount of trust in the mass media. This was down from 36pc last year. So yes, trust is an issue. But is it an issue for technology companies? Yes, of course it is. Both Google and Facebook face a challenge in relation to the spread of low-quality content from clickbait to fake news. But trust is a function of utility from their perspective. They don't need to focus on building trust if they build the best, most useful digital products. Create the best email services, the best mapping tools, the social network where all your friends are, and trust comes as a matter of course. So perhaps media outlets shouldn't be trying to imitate Facebook and Google. But they do need to figure out how to play to their strengths and co-exist with the tech giants, which have stolen a march in terms of digital distribution. Justin B Smith, chief executive of Bloomberg Media, published a survival guide for the platform era this week. "While Google and Facebook may have won Round 1, the real fight is coming up, as $250bn in brand advertising locked up in TV and print floods into digital across the coming years," he said. "Publishers were built for brand advertising, with great content, beautiful environments and strong, trusted brands. Meanwhile, platforms are showing more and more vulnerabilities due to fake news and environments that aren't 'brand safe'. Publishers can still carve out valuable, lasting businesses, but they need to execute a clear plan." Smith is offering better advice than Rusbridger: have your own plan and execute. Don't play the imitation game.

A Special Message From Scoop Co-Founder Alastair Thompson Dear Friends of Scoop, I am writing to you today from a third-floor garret in the town of Dinan, in Brittany France. Through the window in front of me the 12th century St Sauveur Basilica is nearly close enough to touch. I hope my message reaches you well in NZ where I gather autumn has now arrived. If you are one of the 1500+ donors who have pledged to Scoop over the past two years this message is especially directed to you. It contains a detailed explanation as to why Scoop is crowd-funding again, and why we continue to need financial assistance from our readers and members. I would ask that you please take the time to read at least to the end of the first passage in this rather long post. There you will find a series of questions that you may be interested in which link to the answers. We know that those of you who have supported Scoop these past two years didn't do so lightly. We know you are interested in our progress and we understand many of you will have questions about matters like: For how much longer will donor support be needed? This post is answers those questions. And if you have further questions you can reach me on twitter @althecat or by email at alastair@scoopmedia.co.nz. I will be happy to answer any further questions supporters have. Then, having had your questions answered, I hope as many of you as possible will then decide to donate to Scoop's "Opening The Election" PledgeMe Campaign. We are presently at 30% with just two weeks left to run. We will need at least 300 more supporters to step forward and contribute to reach our target. On our PledgeMe Campaign Page you will see that Scoop is seeking $30,000 in funding to "supercharge our election journalism", and this is true. But it's a form of words that may understate the importance of this request for funding. Without this funding we will be struggling to deploy the resources we will need to properly cover this - our 7th election - and our first in our new form as a charitably owned news company. We are very keen to put our best foot forward, and have exciting plans and collaborations brewing which we think you, our readers and supporters, will enjoy. To put this super-charging a little deeper in context, we need this money to ensure we can focus on the election and not on keeping the wolf from the door. For example one of the first things we will do upon reaching the target will be to raise all staff wages to the Living Wage level. For us this will be an important milestone, far too long delayed. In short my message to you today is that this is not a drill. We do need this money. Failure to achieve this target will constrain what we can provide. To sweeten the deal for those of you are involved in, or supportive of political activism, we have also opened up a 2 million "ads for good" collective advert giveaway reward which will be activated when we reach our target. But we also realise that rewards are only part of the equation for those deciding on whether to support a project such as this. Now after two years of asking for and receiving your generous support, a more fulsome explanation of where we are presently at, and where we are headed is needed – especially by those of you who have generously donated in past campaigns. This post is the place to find out all the things. Till now financial detail around the challenges Scoop has faced over the past two and half years have been closely held. Today however, all that can be, is laid bare. For ease of access I have written this in the form of an FAQ. You can jump to the answer of the questions using the contents links below. Contents: Introduction Why don't you just cut costs & stem the losses? Why should Scoop receive public support at all? Why can't you support yourselves with commercially derived revenue? Spinoff.co.nz and NewsRoom.co.nz are getting money, why aren't you? How is the Ethical Paywall going then? Ok then, but what about now? How big is the shortfall now? Ahem, how big is the shortfall? APPENDIX A: A short history of Scoop's member/donor fund-raising efforts B: The Near Impossible Comes Together C: The final big push B: 2016 & a change of guard Kind Regards Alastair Thompson Dinan, France St Sauveur Basilica, Dinan, Brittany Click for big version >> Pledge Towards Scoop's "Opening The Election" Pledge Me Campaign << ****** ### ***** Introduction Spring has arrived here in France. Daffodils, cherries and magnolias led the charge, closely followed by the opening of remarkably intricate buds on the branches of countless trees. The light green shoots will soon become new branches and leaves – and the pageant of life will once again play out its cycle.   And top of my mind today as I write to you is the process of regeneration, the recycling of the old into new and in particular the tricky business cycle of Scoop.co.nz. For the past decade every summer Scoop's customers have gone into a form of seasonal hibernation. And every summer this causes us considerable financial stress. The inability to save sufficient funds each year to finance our summer down-turns has been the Achilles heel of our business. Almost all the losses that were incurred over the past decade occurred in the three months of summer. >> Pledge Towards Scoop's "Opening The Election" Pledge Me Campaign << >> Pledge Towards Scoop's "Opening The Election" Pledge Me Campaign << ****** ### ***** Why don't you just cut costs to cover the summer downturn & stem the losses? The short answer is that we have now cut them as far as is possible. Scoop's revenues have fallen from $900,000 in 2007 to $250,000 now. Any fewer staff than we presently have would mean that we couldn't deliver the core services that the business is based around. With the benefit of hindsight some deeper cuts earlier might have made a difference to the outcome – and this is something I take full responsibility for. In the six years between 2007 and 2013 Scoop's revenues fell $400,000 to $500,000. During that period we were continually finding cost savings and reducing staffing, but we never managed to cut quite fast enough. We under-estimated the impact of the changes in advertising markets and over-estimated our ability to find replacement revenue. Like most digital startups we concentrated energy on investing in developing and selling new subscription newsagent.scoop.co.nz and advertising products. This helped slow the decline but not enough to keep us afloat. That said this investment means we are now much better positioned for a turn-around than we would otherwise have been – and indeed the revenue growth on those products kept us alive. Through the period from the GFC in 2008 through to 2013 we lost on average around $30,000 a year. These losses were covered by investors, mostly friends and family plus a significant outside investor in the period from 2012 to 2014. Since the initiation of "Operation Chrysalis" in 2015 we have cut costs significantly further and as explained in detail in the next section, Scoop's losses are now small and shrinking. But before addressing the question of how much we need to keep the lights on, I think it would be helpful to first address the question of why we think Scoop's lights are worth the candle. >> Pledge Towards Scoop's "Opening The Election" Pledge Me Campaign << >> Pledge Towards Scoop's "Opening The Election" Pledge Me Campaign << ****** ### ***** So why should Scoop receive support? While ensuring the survival of journalism has been the clarion call in most of Scoop's fund-raising efforts these past two years, the effort to keep Scoop alive is not simply about journalism. It is equally about preserving an opportunity - Scoop's regular base of 500,000 monthly influential readers – which we believe can provide a magnificent foundation, foundation both economically and in terms of readership for a new journalism start-up to flourish. But beyond that Scoop's existing core service is – we believe - also very valuable to NZ society. Had Scoop's founders and supporters not thought this were the case we wouldn't have gone to all this trouble. And the fact that over 500,000 monthly readers engage with it, and that 1000 donors, and nearly 150 ethical paywall subscribers are now supporting it is testament that ours is not a mistaken belief, For me keeping Scoop alive has always also been about enabling New Zealand's national discourse, or as Russell Brown once described it "NZ's national argument". When you work at Scoop you see this unfold in front of you. A national debate over the current issues, punctuated by breaking news developments, between the political, business and civil society spheres. As our mission statement says – at Scoop we believe in the "power of compelling ideas to propel themselves into political consciousness if they are able to get exposure and be debated". In other words, and we hope you agree, it is worth enabling a platform which provides the Scoop service because a democracy in which everybody has a voice, is a democracy that can thrive. it is worth putting some metrics behind that for emphasis. Each day: - Our core editorial team of three publish around 200 items containing breaking news content from around 200 different voices - no other publication has that breadth of contributors; - 25,000 users read between 30,000 and 50,000 pages of content. This amounts to about 600 hours, or nearly a month of continuous reading time every day; - Roughly 9000 of these users arrive to read something that they have been searching for on Google; - Half a million links to Scoop.co.nz are displayed in the first page of Google search results pages for an astonishing range of queries; - Google robotically reads around 120,000 pages to check for new material and whether old pages are still live (all Scoop's pages remain live back to June 10 1999 – and accessible via search.scoop.co.nz); - Around 10,000 out-bound links on Scoop (to other sites in our networks, or linked in our content) are clicked. When people want to know when something happened or what someone said, Scoop provides the answer, for free. This is a bulwark against misinformation and fake news. And Scoop reaches the important audiences who need access to reliable factual information – which albeit perhaps counter-intuitively - is what press releases tend to contain. Last week Scoop served at least[*]: - 8869 pages to 3717 readers on Government domains - 897 pages to 303 readers in Parliament (as well as 100ss of email alerts) - 3002 pages to 1718 readers in Universities [*] not all traffic is fully identified in server logs. Back in 2007 Scoop was generating $60,000 in advertising revenue a month from this usage. And yet now - due to the rise of Facebook and Google - Scoop's steadily growing usage isn't nearly sufficient to generate the funds to make our operation commercially viable via conventional advertising. But this is not a measure of Scoop's utility (or value) to New Zealand. Neither as Scoop.co.nz is used now, nor as we may be able to come if we can complete our transition to sustainability over the next two or three years and serve as a foundation for new digital news startups. >> Pledge Towards Scoop's "Opening The Election" Pledge Me Campaign << >> Pledge Towards Scoop's "Opening The Election" Pledge Me Campaign << ****** ### ***** But why can't you support yourselves with commercially derived revenue? This is a good question. And the short answer is that we expect to be able to support ourselves on commercial revenue shortly. We just haven't completed our transition yet. Slowing that process down is the insufficiency of our sales resource. Whereas previously around half of my time at Scoop was spent in sales and business development, these days Scoop's business development team is a one-man band. Had we been more successful in our fund-raising efforts these past two years this is probably where we would have first invested additional funds. >> Pledge Towards Scoop's "Opening The Election" Pledge Me Campaign << >> Pledge Towards Scoop's "Opening The Election" Pledge Me Campaign << ****** ### ***** But Spinoff.co.nz and NewsRoom.co.nz are getting money, why aren't you? Scoop would love to receive the robust levels of corporate sponsorship support that are now flowing to our industry colleagues at Spinoff.co.nz and NewsRoom.co.nz & our audience would certainly justify it. And we congratulate both our competitors for re-opening this source of income. But sponsorship deals are far from easy to get over the line. The normal metrics of marketing spend do not apply and often the critical factor is who you know at the target company or organisation. Being Wellington based, being known mainly as a press release publisher, and being nearly 18 years old all count against us too. Sponsors tend to be attracted to the new and flashy and Scoop.co.nz is more like an old and trusty public transport service – we get you where you want to go, but most people don't tend to give a lot of thought to our upkeep. In addition these new sources of funds for media are indeed new. Sponsorship funding for news didn't really exist back in 2014. To the extent that it did so prior to that it was mainly on the basis of a traditional competitive marketing return-on-investment (ROI) basis, which the arrival of Google, Facebook and programmatic advertising models pretty much destroyed as a viable source of income for niche publishers in NZ. In the three months after the 2014 election we sold no advertising or sponsorship at all. It was like the market had fallen off a cliff. And so we made a conscious decision - which we still think is right - to try to find sustainability without being dependent on advertising dollars. Its worth also pointing out that sponsorship sales efforts are expensive, sponsors need to be kept happy, jollied along, and even when you do so diligently a change of personnel can see them depart in a heartbeat. So when we initiated "Operation Chrysalis" we decided to put our efforts into earning money from our core business, by finding a way of generating value from our existing large reader base with what is clearly a much used and highly-valued service. From this came our new "ethical paywall". And since 2015 nearly all our limited marketing resources have been invested into that. >> Pledge Towards Scoop's "Opening The Election" Pledge Me Campaign << >> Pledge Towards Scoop's "Opening The Election" Pledge Me Campaign << ****** ### ***** So how is the Ethical Paywall going then? Good, albeit not quite as well as we had hoped it would go. To recap: Scoop's "sustainable" business idea, introduced in May 2015, was to change our terms and conditions of use. Legally if you or the business that you work for routinely uses Scoop for professional purposes – i.e. to check out what is going on in matters of professional interest to you or your staff – then you should be paying us. So far 140 organisations have signed on to do so. But many hundreds more, including the vast majority of Govt. departments, local authorities, universities, law firms, PR companies, large corporates and accounting and consultancy businesses are not. Were even a 10% of our corporate uses complying with our terms and conditions of use, we would be profitable today. And it is not as if the costs of professional use of Scoop are high. Meanwhile all these organisations continue to receive free value from us in the form of us carrying their communications to our large and influential readership. The good news is that most of those who do sign on to, contribute towards the up-keep of a service they rely on are staying on board. Our commercial team (who can be contacted at services@scoop.co.nz) estimate we need to get another 100 accredited organisations on board to get to a sustainable break-even position. >> Pledge Towards Scoop's "Opening The Election" Pledge Me Campaign << >> Pledge Towards Scoop's "Opening The Election" Pledge Me Campaign << ****** ### ***** Ok then, but what about now? How big is the shortfall now? I'll get to the answer to that in a second. But first I want to tell a little story. Shortly before he died of leukaemia in early 2012 I bumped into Lloyd Morrison, the founder of Infratil and Morrison & Company, on the Terrace in Wellington. Lloyd and I had become friends after he asked my assistance in an effort to save Air New Zealand for sale to Qantas. With Scoop's support Lloyd, Dr Ian Prior and I mounted what was ultimately a successful effort to help convince the Commerce Commission that having an airline monopoly in NZ and Trans Tasman wouldn't be in the interests of the travelling public. "How's business," Lloyd asked me. "Well not to bad I guess," I replied, and asked after his health. Lloyd indicated he was still fighting on, before offering some advice that has stuck with me ever since. "So the thing is Alastair," he said, "that's not the right answer. When someone asks you how business is? The answer is always 'great!' regardless of whether it is or not. That's what everybody wants to hear. People want to do business with people who are already winning." I took Lloyd's advice to heart and I suspect that it was thanks to doing so that the sales efforts that miraculously kept Scoop alive through 2012, 2013 and 2014 came off as well as they did. But the reason I recount that story as this entire story I am publishing today is breaking that rule. Yet I have a strong feeling that now is the time that it is necessary to do so. By now surely everybody understands just how perilous it is to be in the news media business. Digital advertising cannot support news production in NZ – it is that simple. In the past month Fairfax has lost both its CEO and its chief commercial officer. After losing the CEO the Commerce Commission granted an extension to the time till it will deliver its verdict on the StuffMe merger. And last week after the commercial manager resigned it extended the deadline again. Over the past two years I have lost count of the number of panel discussions held to discuss the funding crisis in the news business. And yet very little that is constructive is done. The Green Party's election policy restoring funding to Radio New Zealand that was lost due to the National Party capping their funding is a step in the right direction, but not nearly enough. And so all things considered, the dynamics we now face - running a business partially funded by donations, and owned by a charity requires a different approach. It is time to break Lloyd's golden rule. >> Pledge Towards Scoop's "Opening The Election" Pledge Me Campaign << >> Pledge Towards Scoop's "Opening The Election" Pledge Me Campaign << ****** ### ***** Ahem. How big is the shortfall? So here's the skinny. Scoop's current operating costs - mostly wages for four full time and three part time staff - are around $25k each month. For most of the year last year on a monthly basis our income exceeded this. But on an annual basis thanks to the summer down-turn we are continuing to experience shortfalls – and this latest summer just past that short fall was $20,000. That said the shortfalls are falling. During 2015, the main year of transformation the overall shortfall in revenue met by crowd-funding was close to $80,000. On an averaged out basis during calendar 2016 the shortfall was $2000 a month, or $24,000 in total. And more recently slowing sales over the 2016-17 summer period - incurred a further $15,000 shortfall. And it is because of these shortfalls that we have had to come back to our supporters and readers this early in 2017 to raise further funds. The good news is that sales in the month of March have already taken us back into the black, more than covering our costs with a small margin on top. In the event we receive the expected growth in support from a professional users over the remainder of 2017 (please email services@scoop.co.nz if you think you or your organisation might be one of these users and would like to purchase a professional use license) we remain on track to reaching long term sustainability this year. And if that is the outcome then it is likely that this be the only fund-raising effort mounted for Scoop Publishing Limited this year. ENDS >> Pledge Towards Scoop's "Opening The Election" Pledge Me Campaign << >> Pledge Towards Scoop's "Opening The Election" Pledge Me Campaign << ****** ### ***** APPENDIX A: A short history of Scoop's crowd/member/donor fund-raising efforts When we embarked on "Operation Chrysalis" a week before Christmas we first held a meeting in the Scoop office to decide whether to try to keep Scoop alive or shut the doors. 2014 had been a very hard year for everybody in the team and so I wasn't sure how it would go. But Scoop's team is definitely not made out of quitters. I began by explaining the dire financial situation we faced. We had made almost no advertising sales at all since the 2014 Election. We only had sufficient funds at that point to get through to January. I then outlined the rescue plan. We would try to turn Scoop's business model around whilst simultaneously turning the privately run business into a charitable foundation. I was open about the fact that we had a slim chance of success – internally I reckoned our chances of getting to the end of the year were about 10% at best. And there was every chance we might fail at the first hurdle. The plan's success was dependent on running a crowd-funding campaign, our first ever, in early 2015 – to get the ball rolling. If that succeeded we then had to develop, deploy and quickly scale a brand new, un-tested business model. If that worked then we would raise some additional funds, again through crowd-funding to but the necessary time to grow the business model towards sustainability. And we faced a significant additional challenge. Because of the nature of Scoop's core wire service business – continuity of content publishing and supply is a must to maintain the confidence of existing clients. As a consequence of this, the 180 degree pivot of Scoop's business model needed to take place while existing services continued undisturbed. So what we set out to try to do was to build a new business engine for the Scoop train – untested - while we remained under full steam travelling down the tracks. And there was no way we could do it without also developing a significant level of financial support from a group of readers and silent supporters who we had, till then, barely engaged with at all. ****** ### ***** B: The Near Impossible Comes Together Scoop is now entering the third year of this transformation. Last Wednesday passed was the second anniversary of the completion of that first PledgeMe campaign. In the two years since we have run four further PledgeMe project campaigns, all of which have succeeded so far. We have enjoyed the repeated support of many of our pledgers through these campaigns. Some have donated four or five times and contributed several hundred dollars to the cause. For this we are enormously grateful. Without the financial support of these 1000+ Kiwis who care about the future of news Scoop.co.nz would not be around today. Our first two PledgeMe campaigns, "Help Scoop to Fly" and "16 days of Scoop" raised just over $45k between them. These bought us time to implement the "ethical paywall" and complete the legal preparations for the launch of the Scoop Foundation for Public Interest Journalism at the beginning of September 2015. The wonderful support and encouragement of PledgeMe'sAnna Guenther, Jackson Wood and Lisa-Marie Richan to teach us how to crowd-fund was a vital contributor to this outcome. To coincide with the launch of the Foundation & with the much appreciated help of a team from the Enspiral network led by Damian Sligo-Green - we launched our first in-house fund-raising website takebackthenews.nz. The site allowed for both donations and for people to sign up as contributors. Between its launch and Christmas 87 new members signed up and we received 100 offers of in kind support or collaboration from 100 contributors. Over the 10 month period from the launch of Operation Chrysalis to the launch of the Scoop Foundation the $48,000 in funds we received from in 525 pledges and 87 direct donations - covered roughly 25% of total expenses - including the costs of developing the new business model and preparing the legal work for the launch of the Foundation. ****** ### ***** C: The final big push But this fund-raising hadn't paid off all of our creditors. And with summer fast approaching more money was needed to ensure we would get through through the downturn. Our biggest PledgeMe campaign - to finance the launch of the Foundation - kicked off in October. It was the first fund-raising campaign mounted by the Scoop Foundation itself and it was by far the most elaborate campaign we had run -including a special run of art t-shirts and certificates with artwork by William Carden Horton, a public meeting, and a Friday the 13th costume party held at Dransfield House. The $50k target in this campaign was the minimum that we needed to both cover our bills and get us through the summer. By now the team was nearly exhausted and running largely on adrenaline, I certainly was. But fortunately by then we also had a fairly experienced team on the job including Steven Wood, Olex Cidor who made us a great series of videos shot at St Andrews on the Terrace to promote it, plus our database compiler Howard Davis, who has since become our arts editor was on the team. Nevertheless it didn't get off to as fast a start as was needed. Around half way through the campaign we decided our "Scoop's Solution to the News Crisis" messaging wasn't working and switched to the most successful campaign slogan we have used so far. A search for "1000 Kiwis who care about the future of NZ news media". It was a line with legs and something very similar was used by NewsRoom's Tim Murphy when he announced his and Mark Jennings launch plans at the end of 2016 for the new NewsRoom. "It [NewsRoomp] will be targeted at an audience that in broad terms we’ve defined as New Zealanders who care. News hounds. People who vote. People aware of the needs of good journalism in a democracy like ours." A positioning statement which was eerily familiar. ****** ### ***** D: 2016 & a change of guard Two weeks after the final campaign of 2015 closed, and after 16 years managing and editing Scoop.co.nz, I left Scoop and New Zealand for an extended overseas sabbatical. Hence my writing and publishing this from France. I remain involved with Scoopin the capacity of volunteer acting as a Director of Scoop and as a Trustee of the Scoop Foundation. And these days my primary efforts are focussed on the thorny issue of achieving financial stability. I very much hope we get there soon. That said it would be a shame having come so far to fail now. Thankfully 2016 brought with it a significantly improved financial performance, and last years fund-raising was able to be conducted in a much more methodical fashion. Joseph Cederwall joined the Scoop Foundation as our community engagement manager mid-year and led our online campaigning effort over the second half of the year. Joseph designed the "Opening the Election" campaign which is now underway, launched Hivemind and built our new Foundation website. Recently following Gordon Campbell's decision to step out of the Editor's role to concentrate on reporting Joseph and on of Scoop's other co-founders Ian Llewellyn were appointed as Scoop's new co-editors. In 2016 the Scoop Foundation Board set a fund-raising goal for the year of $60k. By the end of the year the Foundation had managed to raise half of this sum. In May 2016 the Foundation launched a PledgeMe Membership Drive around our 17th birthday with the title "Journalism a New Model – Membership Drive". The target of $17,000 was met in 303 donations. $7500 of these funds were used to fund three journalism project grants, to Alison McCulloch (Post Natal Depression), and Charlotte Graham and Veronika Meduna (both working on post-earthquake projects). Getting this grant based funding for public interest journalism underway in August was another significant milestone for the overall transformation project. As was the launch of our new mobile version of Scoop m.scoop.co.nz over summer by our new developer Wiremu Demchick. And following that effort we focused our resources on building a new fund-raising portal for the Scoop Foundation at foundation.scoop.co.nz. On the site we published our first Foundation annual report and set up facilities for donations. A fund-raising campaign followed at the end of the year which raised a further $12,000. **** ____----^^----____ **** © Scoop Media Alastair Thompson Scoop Publisher Alastair Thompson is the co-founder of Scoop.

Google always does a great job, from the Pokemon Google Maps overlay to a smart mailbox, but there are a few from other companies worth mentioning. Here's a rundown of all the hillarious (or strange) tech-related April Fools Day jokes from around the web. Google Gnome One of Google's product launches from last year was the Google Home, a $129 smart speaker with Google Assistant. Now the company is teasing the "Google Gnome," an outside version of the Home. You can ask it weather questions, let it control your lawnmower and other tools, and even dress it up in accessories. The Google Gnome has a page on the Google Store, but unfortunately you can't buy it. I really want a rain coat for my Google Home, though. Mrs. Pac-Man in Google Maps For April Fools' 2015, Google added Pac-Man into Google Maps and Ingress. This year, Mrs Pac-Man is invading Google Maps. For regions of the world already on April 1st, a new Mrs. Pac-Man button is visible on the mobile app. You then have to control Mrs. Pac-Man on real-life streets, and of course, outrun the Ghosts. Google's Bubble Wrap Keyboard (English subtitles are available) Google Japan's prank is pretty funny - it's a bubble wrap keyboard. The idea is to pop bubbles on a bubble wrap sheet to form words, then feed the sheet through a reader to send the message. Some of the bubble wrap sheets are even scented. Google Assistant Google has plenty of Easter Eggs in Google Assistant, and as you might expect, there's one for April Fools' Day too. When asked, Assistant will offer advice on how not to get pranked, such as "If something seems too good to be true today, it probably is." Google Wind Google's Netherlands division has its own April Fools' Day gag, named 'Google Wind.' The idea is to use machine learning to control the weather, using Holland's famous windmills. I'll admit, this one is pretty great. Netflix Live Will Arnet has been in plenty of Netflix original content, from BoJack Horseman to A Series of Unfortunate Events. For April Fools' Day, Netflix is proud to share 'Netflix Live', which is nearly an hour of Arnett commentating ordinary events like toasting bread and completing a crossword puzzle. It's actually funnier than it sounds. You can watch the full thing here (a Netflix subscription is required). T-Mobile ONEsie T-Mobile's prank is a onesie, with "full-body coverage" and a built-in 4G LTE hotspot. You can actually buy it for $40, but the real one doesn't have any tech inside it. Hulu Hu With the claim that the human attention span has "dropped to eight seconds," Hulu has released 'Hu.' It's just a library of short clips from existing Hulu content, and you actually need an account to see them. This is probably the lamest April Fools' Day gag in the list - better luck next year, guys. OnePlus Dash drink OnePlus is really proud of its Dash Charge feature, even to the point of enlisting celebrities to talk about it. For April Fools', the company made real Dash Charge energy drinks. You can find our review of the drink here. Lyft Mono For April Fools' Day, Lyft has announced the 'Lyft Mono.' It's a wearable glove, vaguely resembling a Nintendo Power Glove. This gag is actually real, and once you put it on and get the app, sticking out your thumb will hail a Lyft cab. You can sign up to for a chance to get one here. Honor BFF We all need some positive reinforcement every now and then, right? Honor thinks so, and created the Honor BFF. This imaginary phone uses machine learning to periodically give you compliments and motivation. Hopefully it ships with Android 7.1 Nougat. Google Haptic Helpers This is probably my favorite gag so far. In order to create a more realistic virtual reality experience, you can schedule a "haptic helper" to come to your house and help create a more realistic environment. Just watch the video, it's hilarious. Amazon Petlexa Alexa is cool and all, but your furry friends need one too. As the name implies, Petlexa is Alexa for your pets. Contour by SlickWraps Putting a skin on your phone or tablet is too much work. For April Fool's Day, Slickwraps is teasing the 'Countour' - a machine that sprays on device skins. Frankly, I'm not sure if this is actually real or not, but there is a page for it on SlickWrap's store. Nvidia GTX G-Assist How many times have you been playing an online game, only to be interrupted by someone in real life? NVIDIA has made the 'G Assist,' a flash drive that can take over for you if you're busy. It can also help you beat boss battles, and provides periodic reminders to consume energy drinks. More information and a video can be found here. Google's data center on Mars If you have important data, you need a backup. That's why Google announced its first interplanetary data center, named "Ziggy Stardust," on the Google Cloud Platform Blog today. Located in the Gale Crater on Mars, it will store a cache of data from Earth to prevent irrecoverable loss when a planetary disaster strikes. Google hopes to finish the data center by 2018. LineageOS' mascot CyanogenMod's mascot, Cid, was one of the most recognizable icons in the Android community. As the spiritual successor to CyanogenMod, LineageOS has created its own mascot - 'Ink'. The project also announced 'Br0zip,' an artificial intelligence that can port LineageOS to any device in no time at all. Chromebook accessories Even though most Chromebooks can now run Android apps, you still can't use your Chromebook like an Android phone/tablet for all use cases. Until now, that is. Google has announced a Chromebook Groupie Stick (seen above), a Chromebook Cardboard headset, and a Chromebook armband. See the company's blog post for more info. Exynos Yoga Processor Remember when curved phones were a thing? Maybe we'll see more in the coming months, because Samsung has just unveiled the Exynos Yoga Processor - the first flexible mobile SoC. Anyone up for a Galaxy Flex? Carved screen protector Carved is a small Indiana-based phone case company, but now they are working on a wooden screen protector. Why hasn't this been done before? I'll take ten. I'm Feeling Woof/I'm Feeling Meow By force-touching the Google app icon in iOS, you can select "I'm Feeling Woof" or "I'm Feeling Meow." These give your pets access to the stuff they care about - from dog food to balls of yarn. More info can be found on Google's blog post. Waze maps for Mars According to the company's blog, Waze is has begun to map the surface of Mars. Certain members of the Waze community will also be sent to the Red Planet to more accurately map the surface. JerryRigEverything's NoPhone video If you haven't heard about it, the NoPhone is a solid piece of plastic designed to simulate the feeling of a phone in your pocket. I'm not really sure if anyone uses it, but JerryRigEverything is happy to break it just as much as any other phone. Google Translate for Heptapod B Using machine learning, Google Translate can now decrypt messages written in Heptapod B - the language from the film Arrival. On an unrelated note, it looks like someone from Google is still rocking a Nexus 10. See Google's blog post for more info. Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s ASUS has an April Fools gag too - the Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s Veritas Blue Limited Special Edition. I would probably buy this phone. MKBHD's Nokia 3310 review You may have heard about the updated Nokia 3310, but it turns out the original is an amazing smartphone. Okay, maybe not, but the video is pretty funny. Open GApps Femto Do you need to flash the latest Gapps package on your device, but you don't have a stable network connection? Not to worry, the Open GApps Femto package is here to help. It uses the United States HAARP service (which is not real, but just pretend) to download the latest GApps package. You can find more info at the GApps blog.   That concludes our coverage of April Fools' Day in the tech world. Let us know in the comments below which gag you liked the most!

Yeah they actuqally had me going until I compared a whois of kodi.tv vs kickasstorrents.com, a site that actually was seized. The whois data would show that it is not official. Derik Taylor So this is one I find interesting. Could it technically be a criminal offense to falsify a domain seizure? How would that work? Greg Abbott Doubt it, technically a website isn't an official document. mondeca I hope every year that Google will announce something real and awesome on April Fools' Day, like they did with Gmail. Once again, I am disappointed. JG It isn't technically April Fools Day yet... Least not in the US...

Corbin Davenport Yep, that had me laughing too. AdrianFDiratama . How about JG I'd actually like to see Google produce the Google Gnome.... All they'd need to do is add a battery (and Qi charging) to a Google Home and stick it in a new Gnome shell... Make sure its IP68 and maybe even MIL-STD-810G certified. It'd be a fun little gadget to put on the picnic table of your next summer back yard get together. Pump out some tunes, order pizza & Ubers for everyone to go home in, etc... Or take out when you work in the garden & don't want to get your phone dirty... Maybe even produce one with an LTE radio (and GPS). Then you could take it out of WiFi range camping. Wake up and find him chilling next to your tent in his little chair "Hey Google, how's today's weather? When does the rafting place open? How far away from the camp site is it?" cdotlawrence Maybe like a more customizable (from a looks standpoint), durable, & usable-on-go version of Home? Google Home Pro/Ultra? Interesting idea, but not sure why you wouldn't do most of the things it would do on your phone. Some specific use cases like you mentioned but beyond those, idk.

If you’re anything like me, when the House of Representatives decided yesterday that ISPs can sell your browsing data to basically anyone, you were positively furious. The word bull and something closely resembling the word “ship” rolled around in my head like a marble in a cup. I go to the Internet partly to work, partly to disconnect from the real world. And I like my privacy for both of those things. “You can’t have it.” — bunch of US officials. Harsh, I still want my privacy. I wanna browse pictures of cats in peace, then share a laugh over them without someone uninvited seeing any line of chat. I want to read NASA’s latest tidbits without the NSA (subtracting an A makes a huge difference) peering over my shoulder. It’s my experience. It’s my little corner of the immaterial. I don’t want anyone to burst in on it. If I wanted to be under constant surveillance I’d fly to London. But I don’t, so I just Google-Map London and use the tiny yellow guy to see the sights. *sigh* That’s not how it works, though, and I know that. ISPs keep track of everything you do because they actually connect you to the disjointed bits and servers to create the seamless Internet we know and love. For the most part, they had to keep this data to themselves, so we had some modicum of privacy. That’s about to change for those of you living in the US, congrats, since that data is now up for grabs by anyone who can pay for it — and make no mistake, people will pay for it, profile you with it, and then try to sell you stuff according to that profile. Because capitalism. I’m not a fan of that. Somehow it manages to have this 1984-meets-Brave New World vibe and I don’t want any of it, no siree. Paint me a barbarian but I’d rather not get a 10% discount on something I may actually want if it means a server somewhere is crunching my 3 AM alcohol-fueled-research of exotic cuisine on Wikipedia like so many 1’s and 0’s. ALSO READ  Internet schools man for trying to "mansplain" a NASA astronaut Luckily, there’s one brave soul out there who feels the same way I do but also has the skills to do something about it. His name is Dan Schultz, and he has the next-best-thing after Internet invisibility. Dan heard about the vote on Twitter somewhere around 1 AM, turned off Zelda and coded Internet Noise — a tool which will shotgun searches in your browser left and right, all in the name of foggifying your real searches in a deluge of random ‘noise’. “I cannot function in civil society in 2017 without an internet connection, and I have to go through an ISP to do that,” he says. Hiding in plain sight Internet Noise acts like your run of the mill browser extension, but in truth, it’s just a website which will auto-open a bunch of random Google search tabs. The idea is that if you can’t keep an ISP from profiling you, you can at least give them a false image of yourself. It’s a pretty sad thing to need such a tool, and Schultz himself hopes that Noise will help people understand the risk their online privacy is under at this point. Advertisement It’s a pretty straightforward program. Schultz simply googled “top 4,000 nouns” and made a gibberish-list with all of them. With a click on “Make some Noise”, Internet Noise draws on the magic powering Google’s “I’m feeling lucky” button to search for those terms or permutations of them, opening five tabs of results. Ten seconds later, you get another five, then five more, and so on. It will keep going until you hit “STOP THE NOISE!”, by which point your browsing history should look like a potpourri of random links. Schultz says the best way to use it is to start the Noise when you call in for the night and stop it the next day. Soon enough, you’ll start seeing some pretty random stuff popping up in your Facebook feed, for example. Stuff you won’t have the first clue as to what it is, and that that’s proof the Noise is working, muddying your Internet activity profile, causing algorithms to spew out all kinds of false positives. Image credits g4ll4is / Flickr. Still, it’s not a do-all-end-all program. Anyone slightly more competent than your average advertising company could probably pick out your searches from the noise with a decent success rate since they’re obviously random clicks that have little follow-through. With 4,000 terms and 16,000,000 two-word combinations of them to rifle through, it’s also really unlikely to visit a page once and astronomically unlikely to visit it three or more times. It’s a really random fog-maker and its activity doesn’t look human or plausible enough to be truly good at masking your activity. A smart enough algorithm can probably pick Noise apart in a few seconds. But not all algorithms are smart. ALSO READ  Engineers Just Smashed Record for Fast Wireless Data Trasmission: 6 Gigabits per second It might even get you into some more hardcore surveillance if the program searches add up to something which appears sketchy. Schultz obviously hasn’t been able to pedigree all the terms to see if any could land you in a spot of trouble — think “pipes”, “industrial fertilizers”, and  “do we really need the government” in one night. I’m exaggerating on that last one just to prove a point. At the end of the day, though, Schiltz says the main point is to raise awareness. However, the project is open source and could evolve into a more complex program. People are already contributing, fixing minor bugs and some are suggesting possible improvements. But until more efficient privacy kits become available, your only real option is to learn as much as you can about what the tools you use can and can’t do and try to dodge the system as well as possible beyond what they offer. But I do harbor hope. Internauts have never had much political traction, but they’ve never lacked for imagination, resourcefulness, and a brash commitment to stick it to the man when his ethics fall into question. The Noise might be feeble, but its offspring won’t. If you missed it, here’s a link to Internet Noise: Noise-me!   Like us on Facebook Enjoyed this story?

In this intro video, Gmail Product Manager Paul McDonald introduces a radical advance in Gmail technology: Of course, Google trolled the internet by releasing the video on March 30. (Gmail itself had been introduced, not as a joke, on April 1, 2004.) Not content to live with just an intro video and a beta site, Google posted these hilarious "interviews" with "experts." First, a "paralanguage expert": And now an "environmental movement specialist" who suggests humans are "graspers, killers": A few days later, the University of Southern California's Institute for Creative Technologies actually implemented a few parts of Gmail Motion using a Microsoft Kinect and custom software.

A young woman lost in the Arizona desert for five days filming her struggle to survive on her cell phone right up until the moment she thought she would never see her loved ones again. Tonight her account through dramatic footage and what she did right that saved her life. Here's ABC's Matt Gutman. I love my family. Mom, dad, kalie. Reporter: Recording a good-bye video to loved ones. Something no one expects they'll ever have to do. I just want to go home. I don't even want to do this trip anymore, I'm so scared. Reporter: Especially not 24-year-old amber van heck who just days before began a road trip that should have been the time of her life. But a series of mishaps instead brought her to the brink of death. Three weeks ago the outdoorsy Texas college student set out on a 3,000-mile road trip to the grand canyon all alone. Pretty courageous of you. I don't know if I'd call it courageous. It's more of a -- stubborn, probably. Reporter: She had a couple of particular spots in mind. The havasu falls trailhead, a remote spot in the grand canyon, it has aqua blue plunge pools so popular it requires a reservation. That's the trailhead? Yep. It's in the middle of nothing. Yes. Let's go. Reporter: This week we returned with amber to this fateful spot. The place where, directed by her smartphone, amber turned off highway 64 and onto this dirt road. I trusted Google maps which I shouldn't have. So we're barely a mile off the road. We're driving in empty space. Check that out. Nothing. Reporter: As night falls on March 12th, amber says she drives another hour and a half deeper into the middle of nowhere. When I came to the fence and I was like, oh. There wasn't a road here. That's when I was like, this is not good. That's when I tried going into the gps app and telling it to take me back. It was like, sorry, you have no internet service. Reporter: For a brief moment she's able to get cell service and immediately calls 911. I was in such a panicked state. When they said, what is the nature of your emergency? I let out a sob and I said, please help me. And I heard it drop. And I just -- Reporter: With no cell service for her Google navigation app, amber is about to lose a second precious resource. I was trying to watch my gas. Is that Orange light blinking? It had been blinking. Reporter: Earlier that day she had stopped to gas up her Ford edge and pumps only about one-third of a tank, hoping to save some money. How often do you think, if I just put $5, or just half a tank instead? Every day. I could have spared myself a lot of grief. Reporter: 119 hours of grief to be exact, which amber would battle the triumvirate of no fuel, no cell service, no navigation. In the darkness, she parks alongside the first manmade structure she sees, hoping a sign of life will appear in the morning. She begins documenting her ordeal. Hopefully it doesn't take too long to be found. Reporter: She's actually stranded on one of the largest cattle ranches in Arizona, run by Gary Wilson. It has happened to several other people trying to get across this ranch. Google Earth tells you that you can. But this ranch is actually closed. Reporter: Google did not respond to our requests for comment. A gps industry source previously told ABC news it is important for drivers to keep in mind the gps devices are to be used as navigational AIDS only. It is the responsibility of drivers to exercise common sense." A cowboy usually patrols the area where amber is parked, but again, amber was out of luck. He was gone for about five days. And that just happened to be the time that she was out here. Reporter: Back home, amber's dad, Steven, tries calling her phone and pinging her on her gps app. There is no response. I snapped at my boss that day. Because I was worried about her. Reporter: But there are some encouraging signs. The occasional plane or helicopter overhead. The helicopter just flew by. I got out of my car and waved as frantically as I could. I guess up there it's hard to notice small things on the ground. Reporter: Amber does have some advantages in the wild. The former girl scout and injuring rotc is now putting to use all the survivor skills she's learned. Using large rocks, she spells out the word "Help" to be hen by aircraft above. She also makes a fire. I can't get anything here to burn black, it all burns gray or not at all. Reporter: And luckily for her, she's brought plenty of food and water that she begins rationing meticulously. Three bottles a day should last me for at least a week and a half. Reporter: It's now Wednesday, March 15th. Amber plans to stay put until help arrives. I'm out here for -- 63 hours now. Reporter: Back in Texas, dad begins an active hunt for his daughter. I'd posted in the private Facebook. I said, look, my daughter's missing. I need some people to try to find her. This is the last place I saw her. Reporter: The problem, Stephen references amber's last known location. In New Mexico, where her app pinged him back on Saturday. The next day, suddenly amber sees a vehicle approaching and she sprints into action. Barefoot. I immediately jumped out of my car, tried to run after them, not thinking about my feet, not thinking about anything else. If this is where I get out, it doesn't matter. They didn't see me in their rear view. I'm okay. Reporter: As day four in the hot desert sun comes to a close, amber hits a low point. Almost exactly 100 hours out here now. All I can keep thinking is how much I want my daddy. And my mom. I don't want to be alone anymore. At what point did you decide that you had to rescue yourself? By about the fourth day. I figured there should have been at least a search out. But I hadn't seen anything, heard anything. Reporter: The next morning, amber takes a gigantic risk embarking on what she says would be an 11-mile desperate hike for a cell signal. It's amazing, you can see flagstaff mountains so clearly from here. That's exactly why I chose to walk that way, because flagstaff has cell towers on it. Reporter: After dialing 911 over 70 times, at last a connection. I started crying. Payi saying, please help me. Reporter: She tells the operator she's somewhere between havasu park and the highway that goes to the southern rim visitors center. She's like, in the grand canyon? No, ma'am, I'm in the desert, I've been here five days. I don't know what she was going to say because it was gone. Reporter: Just like that the call dropped. I was heartbroken in that moment. Reporter: She doesn't know it -- We had a virtually unreadable 911 call, up known location, a woman who's panicking -- Reporter: She provided just uh-uh to point Arizona's department of public safety in the right direction. Pilot Joe than nivez and paramedic Edgar vicenet retrace the route. They spot a glare, the top of amber's vehicle. Then amber's sign for the sky. I look down, we see -- must have been 20, 30-foot letters, "Help" written in rocks on the ground next to the car. This has exot got to be it. Reporter: Amber's not there but the rescue team doesn't give up hope because amber wisely had left this message. It said, "I'm not here, I walked east along the road to find cell phone signal, if you're reading this sign, please help me." Let's go. We loaded up. And continued down the road from there. Then I heard a chopper again. And that's when I saw the speck getting bigger. I look, I see someone jumping up and down in the road waving at us. I was like -- they're coming for me. Reporter: After five arduous days, amber van Hecke is stranded no more. Next thing you know I'm two feet from her. First thing that comes out of my mouth was, did you call? All I could answer was high, then ugly sobbing and holding on to him. Reporter: The crew flies her straight to the hospital in flagstaff. I had said, you know what, you do everything right besides running out of gas. If I had to get lost, I wouldn't mind getting stranded with you, you know what you're doing. Reporter: After getting treated for exposure and dehydration, an emotional phone call to her dad. I said, I was worried sick. She said, I thought you were hunting for me. I said, I was -- in the wrong place. Reporter: Two weeks since her rescue, while still healing physically and emotionally, amber says she has no regrets. I did do right things even if I did make mistakes. If I can just share those things that I did right with everyone, if that saves even one life, it's worth it. Reporter: For "Nightline," I'm Matt Gutman in flagstaff, Arizona. This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate. How woman got lost and stranded near Grand Canyon for 5 days Amber Vanhecke says she was driving and following her GPS when she lost internet service and couldn't get through when she called 911.

Google knows this and the company has so far done a good job at allowing their apps and services to be used with non-Android devices, such as its Chromecast streaming device. Now the good news for SoundCloud users is that if you’ve been dying for some Chromecast support on your iOS device, you’ll be pleased to learn that SoundCloud has announced that it will now finally support Chromecast streaming on iOS. SoundCloud was already compatible with audio devices like Sonos, and for Android there was already Chromecast integration, so we guess iOS users will finally be able to enjoy the feature as well. According to SoundCloud, “What’s new? Now users with a SoundCloud Go+ subscription can stream their complete catalog through Google Chromecast. We also enabled shared playback, so multiple users can control what’s playing. Finally, we upgraded both of the mobile apps and the receiver to provide a consistent and streamlined experience.” The feature should already be live so whether you want to stream it through your TV or through speakers, that option is now finally available to you, so definitely check it out if this sounds like something you might be interested in.

By Abby Ohlheiser / The Washington Post The thing that is usually good about April Fool’s Day is that it is just one day. But 2017 has taken even that from us. Because the hoax-filled “holiday” falls on a Saturday this year, a number of this year’s jokes have rolled out early. Some pranks launched on Friday, while others went live even earlier in the week. As we have in years past, The Washington Post is keeping tabs on all the pranks we can find (or, more often, jokes that are pitched to us by brands). We’ve begun our tracking of this hoax wasteland a day early to account for all the stuff that crept into March. Below is our list of all the April Fools’ pranks on the internet this year, broken up into a few categories. Whether you’ve come here to fact check something you read online that seems a bit off, or because you just like to watch the world burn, we hope this list will be helpful over the next couple of days. And may God have mercy on our souls. Tech and Web: The weather map is just emojis at Dark Sky. DeviantArt is mostly art of biting pears now. Fontbundles.net restyled its entire website in Comic Sans in a rare display of April Fools subtlety. Reddit’s April Fool’s thing is “Place,” which is less of a joke and more of a massive test of Reddit’s ability to cooperate Kik isn’t really copying Snapchat and introducing “storyz” Yo ALSO isn’t introducing a “stories” feature Roku introduced a fake new feature that suggests snacks to pair with what you watch “Hu” isn’t a new Hulu service that shortens TV shows to 8 seconds Lyft’s “mono” wearable for hailing a car is a joke Tinder’s “live date” on Facebook Live is also a joke Doordash isn’t introducing a kids’ app called “M.O.M.” Duolingo isn’t offering an emoji course A “Netflix Live” preview video on the streaming service gives you a full 45 minutes of Will Arnett commenting on extremely boring video clips. Hinge, a relationship app, isn’t launching a “parental controls” feature Master and Dynamic isn’t really selling concrete headphones “Apocalypse Mingle” won’t really match you with a romantic partner based on how well you’d survive the End Times together Google The Google Maps app can turn into a functional game of Ms. Pac Man (They’ve done a similar prank in the past) Google Netherlands isn’t going to use the country’s windmills and machine learning to control the weather Google Gnome isn’t a creepy, outdoors-only home assistant Google won’t send “Haptic” helpers to your home to simulate smell and touch while you play VR Google isn’t introducing a bubble wrap keyboard in Japan Politics! D.C. isn’t getting a Joe Biden-themed pop up bar A fitness tracker company isn’t turning Trump’s border wall into a climbing wall George Takei, who has a history of elaborate April Fools’ pranks, is *not* running for Congress. This one tricked a lot of people — including some entertainment news sites (come onnn) — until he revealed it was a joke several hours later. Miscellaneous Brands Thinkgeek (takes a deep breath) isn’t selling a Hot Pocket sleeping bag, a swear jar, a tentacuddle wrap, a Where’s Waldo parody featuring Barb from Stranger Things, a “swim desk”, a full-body snake temporary tattoo (a la “Westworld”, the movie “Shazaam” starring Sinbad (it doesn’t exist), a bike horn of Gondor, or a “YAAS Cat-apult” Lexus doesn’t have a “Lane Valet” that will move other cars out of the way for you. Eau de Chlôrine, a perfume that makes you smell like a swimming pool, isn’t real. Plated isn’t launching a perfume line that makes you smell like food. Coffee-mate didn’t make a coffee-flavored creamer. Auntie Annie’s isn’t launching a rebrand that puts a Snapchat filter on their logo. Women can’t rent a fully-furnished storage unit as a “She Shed” to escape their families. Progressive isn’t selling insurance for people who are moving to Mars. Whopper toothpaste 🙁 You can’t ship yourself to a friend in a “man freight” Jim Beam isn’t going to start selling canned beans “Chugg” isn’t a real energy drink for college kids Kars4Kids isn’t really a service that gives cars to children so they can drive them A doll company isn’t selling Voodoo dolls The viral “Nanodrop” ad with Paris Hilton in it is a Sodastream prank Carrabba’s, the Italian food chain, isn’t selling its pasta sauce as a beauty mask Sorry, FreshDirect isn’t selling “pitless avocados” “Speed of light” USB cable doesn’t actually exist Tripping hasn’t struck a deal with the White House to rent out its rooms while Trump is out of town on the weekends Groupon hasn’t joined the flat earth movement Bush’s beans isn’t selling jelly beans in a can You can’t use an app to destroy all the clutter in your apartment KFC isn’t launching sushi in New Zealand Mike’s Harder isn’t selling a “Keg in a Can” (this is primarily a visual gag) A tool company isn’t launching a baby accessories line Honda horn emoji are fake, but maybe not the worst idea? A car history tracker can’t also check your potential date’s history Toilet paper blinds are fake Snickers isn’t selling Knickers Delta won’t fly you to Mars Virgin Trains isn’t going to start tattooing tickets on their customers’ bodies Animal jokes Sugarfina isn’t selling dog treats now The “Harambed” isn’t real Turkey Hill didn’t introduce Cowsonly.com, a dating site only for cows Tough Mudder isn’t starting Puppy Mudder, an athletic event for dogs You’ll never actually be able to buy a watch made out of your pet’s fur Amazon’s Alexa can’t understand your pets now Trulia isn’t launching a real estate service for pets Cheapflights isn’t selling “Catflights,” or flights that come with a cat companion Puzzles for pets are fake A digital retailer isn’t selling a DIY goat soap-making kit (that includes a goat) Freshwater dolphins haven’t returned to the Finger Lakes Petcube isn’t selling “bum” covers for your pets The Wildlife Conservation Society isn’t raising money to buy tiny little raincoats for sloths iFixit didn’t release a tool kit for hamsters These rats can’t detect “man flu,” but can actually detect land mines, apparently. A shirt made out of the bodies of cockroaches is fake, and will not give you cockroach-like enhancements You can’t buy cockroach milk either Fake wearables, “smart” items, and AI jokes: Wayfair isn’t selling a smart sofa. Cargurus isn’t introducing a bot that lets autonomous cars choose their driver. Quilted Northern isn’t launching a wearable to record all your bathroom activity. You can’t buy a holograph-projecting drone to attend meetings for you. Alamo isn’t launching a line of smart, “self-vacationing” rental cars KFC Canada isn’t making a “smart” bucket T-Mobile isn’t selling a “full-body wearable” called “T-Mobile ONEsie” Petco didn’t make a pooper scooper that is powered by a drone A smart hibernation pod isn’t real (and it’s also not a prank that appears to be done by Samsung) An adult toy company isn’t going to start doing drone deliveries Fake “news” and history The National Museum of American History launched a fake Smells of American History project, but also created an actual research section on historical perfumes because it can’t stop being a museum, even on April Fools Day. Traveling in a straight line through Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas and Louisiana won’t conjure a homicidal elf, and no one ever believed that it would. The World Wildlife Fund has not discovered a polar bear living in the Outer Hebrides in Scotland David Attenborough isn’t going in a different direction for his next documentary Kellyanne Conway isn’t the commencement speaker at the University of Albany this year Messing with children “Blorskee” “Tangeteen” and “Speekuzslmn” (pronounced “speak-ew”) are not real words, much to the relief of the students who took this joke spelling test in class.

By: AFP | Updated: April 3, 2017 11:54 am The two US tech giants are expected to use Toshiba’s memory chips for their cloud services.( Image for representation, Source: Reuters) Google and Amazon joined a list of potential buyers eyeing Toshiba’s lucrative memory chip business as the Japanese conglomerate seeks bidders to cover huge losses, a newspaper said today. Toshiba has reportedly completed the first round of bidding for its prized memory chip business, seen as key for the cash-strapped company to turn itself around.Some 10 foreign companies and funds, including Google and Amazon, tendered bids, the mass-circulation Yomiuri Shimbun said, quoting unnamed sources. The two US tech giants are expected to use Toshiba’s memory chips for their cloud services, the daily said.Taiwan’s Hon Hai, which acquired Japanese electronics maker Sharp last year, has apparently bid more than 2 trillion yen (USD 18 billion), the daily said. Immediate confirmation of the report was not available.Toshiba shares jumped more than five percent on Friday after local media reported that bidders included Apple, US private-equity firm Silver Lake Partners and American chipmaker Broadcom. Also Read: Toshiba offered USD 17.9 billion for chip unit by Silver Lake and Broadcom: Nikkei Toshiba is expected to negotiate with individual candidates this month.Local media said any foreign buyer would need to pass a Japanese government review, given concerns about security around systems already using Toshiba’s memory chips. Toshiba is the world’s number two supplier of memory chips for smartphones and computers, behind South Korea’s Samsung, and the business accounted for about a quarter of its 5.67 trillion yen in revenue last fiscal year. The news report came after angry investors lambasted Toshiba executives at a shareholders meeting over its warning that annual losses could balloon to more than USD 9.0 billion. The red ink is largely tied to huge cost overruns and construction delays at its US nuclear power unit Westinghouse Electric, which filed for bankruptcy protection late March.

Join For Free Learn how API management supports better integration in Achieving Enterprise Agility with Microservices and API Management, brought to you in partnership with 3scale Building on earlier stories about how my API partners are making API deployment more modular and composable and pushing forward my understanding of what is possible with API deployment, I'm looking into the details of what DreamFactory enables when it comes to API deployment. "DreamFactory is a free, Apache 2 open source project that runs on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. DreamFactory is scalable, stateless, and portable" — making it a pretty good candidate for running it wherever you need. After spending time at Google and hearing about how they want to enable multi-cloud infrastructure deployment, I wanted to see how my API service provider partners are able to actually power these visions of running your APIs anywhere, in any infrastructure. Using DreamFactory you can deploy your APIs using Docker, Kubernetes, or directly from a GitHub repository, something I'm exploring as standard operating procedure for government agencies, like we see with 18F's U.S. Forest Service ePermit Middle Layer API. In my opinion, all federal, state, and local government should be able to deploy API infrastructure like this. One of the projects I am working on this week is creating a base blueprint of what it will take to deploy a human services API for any city in Google or Azure. I have a demo working on AWS already, but I need a basic understanding of what it will take to do the same in any cloud environment. I'm not in the business of hosting and operating APIs for anyone, let alone for government agencies. This is why I have partners like DreamFactory, who I can route specific projects as they come in. Obviously, I am looking to support my partners as they support me, but I'm also looking to help other companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies better leverage the cloud providers they are already using. I'll share more stories about how I'm deploying APIs to AWS, as well as Google and Azure, as I do the work over the next couple of weeks. I'm looking to develop a healthy toolbox of solutions for government agencies to use. This week's project is focused on the human services data specification, but next week I'm going to look replicating the model to allow for other Schema.org vocabulary, providing simple blueprints for deploying other common APIs like products, directories, link listings, and directories. My goal is to provide a robust toolbox of APIs that anyone can launch in AWS, Google, and Azure with a push of a button — eventually.

The News Integrity Initiative will launch with $14 million from Facebook, the Ford Foundation, Mozilla and others, based at the City University of New York's journalism school, which will coordinate research, projects and events. "We want to bring the conversation past just talking about media and to bring the public in," said Jeff Jarvis, who heads CUNY's Tow-Knight Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism. "We want to go beyond the fake news discussion and get to what I hope is a flight to quality." Fake news became a serious issue in the US election campaign, when clearly fraudulent stories circulated on social media, potentially swaying some voters. Concerns have been raised since then about hoaxes and misinformation affecting elections in Europe, with investigations showing how "click farms" generate revenue from online advertising using made-up news stories. - Better tools - Facebook and Google have stepped up efforts to root out misinformation, Jarvis said, adding that helping the public understand the difference between fraudulent news and serious journalism will constitute an important element of the effort. "We have to equip the public with better tools and better discussions," he said. The initiative's mission is "to advance news literacy, to increase trust in journalism around the world and to better inform the public conversation," a statement said. The founding funders include Facebook and the Craigslist founder Craig Newmark's philanthropic fund along with the Ford Foundation, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, the Tow Foundation, AppNexus, Mozilla and Betaworks. Campbell Brown, a former NBC and CNN journalist hired early this year to head the Facebook news partnerships team, said the social network is looking at the issue "holistically." "We think news literacy is a global concern. It is important for people to be able to identify misleading news content, be discerning about the news that shows up on Facebook and everywhere else," she said. "This is not a problem that we could ever solve alone." Facebook and Google have already taken steps to cut off advertising revenues to news sites promoting misinformation. Facebook has also ramped up efforts to flag news stories that may be false, and has launched a "journalism project" that aims to support the news ecosystem. "We have to look at this globally, so we are going to be supporting a lot of organizations around the world addressing the challenges," Brown said. Facebook joined the project as part of its effort toward "helping people make more informed decisions when they do encounter false news," she said. Other partners include Arizona State University, the International Center for Journalists, the News Literacy Project, the Trust Project, and the public relations group Weber Shandwick. Denmark's Constructive Institute at Aarhus University is also taking part, along with the European Journalism Centre in the Netherlands, the Colombia-based Fundacion Gabriel Garcia Marquez para el Nuevo Periodismo Iberoamericano, the Hamburg Media School and Hans-Bredow-Institut in Germany, the Polis media department at the London School of Economics, France's Sciences Po university, the Hong Kong-based Society of Publishers in Asia, the Walkley Foundation in Australia, Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales and UNESCO. The move is one of many efforts to crack down on fake news. In February, a group of 37 French and international media outlets, supported by Google, launched "CrossCheck," a fact-checking platform aimed at detecting fake information that could affect the French presidential election. 3 Apr 2017 Previous Back to summary Next Newsletter AFP Subscribe to our newsletter AFP's worldwide network The global network of Agence France Presse covers 150 countries Find out more Find out more Contact us If you have news to share or a question, comment or suggestion, contact us via...

But the ads pitch OnePlus against Apple, Google and Samsung. Photograph: Kind Courtesy: OnePlus. When OnePlus signed Amitabh Bachchan as brand ambassador, there was little doubt that the Chinese phone maker would jog down the beaten track with high-pitched television and hoardings-led campaigns, just like other smartphone brands. The first ads are out and OnePlus has played to the script so far, swinging sharply away from its early days of a digital-only promotional strategy and referral purchases. While the company says this is the best way to tap into the potential of the 25-million-plus smartphone market in India (IDC, Q4 2016), experts ask whether this will help OnePlus make the transition from an exclusive and experential purchase to a mass-market brand. OnePlus believes it can, by spreading awareness about the phone and its features. Vikas Agarwal, general manager, OnePlus India says the brand is using Bachchan to do just that. As a mass market label, OnePlus wants to reach out to new target groups and geographies that have been left out of the brand’s digital net. Bachchan is popular across income and age groups and the brand hopes to ride on his appeal. Agarwal adds, while the company has a new advertising strategy and budget, it is sticking with its online-only sales strategy. OnePlus had created quite a stir with an ‘invite only’ promotional campaign at the time of its launch. The current campaign, Agarwal says, is essentially a scaled-up version of the same referral marketing. Bachchan and stand-up comedian Rohan Joshi of AIB have come together to launch a series of unique activations including a quiz show where Bachchan plays the role of contestant and declares OnePlus to be the best brand through an audience poll. Agarwal says that OnePlus is the third biggest brand in premium segment ($400 or above) in India and the company wanted to leverage the positive feedback shared by actual end users for the campaign. “The Best Smartphone Contest communicates this core message and recognises the contribution of the OnePlus community with rewards that include a grand prize of Rs 1 crore along with numerous other offers and a chance to meet Bachchan in person,” he adds. OnePlus is owned by a subsidiary of the Chinese phone maker BBK which also owns the Vivo and Oppo labels. Many believe that the strategy to go big with ad campaigns could also be an extension of a larger corporate strategy as both Oppo and Vivo are big advertisers. Agarwal looks at it differently. He explains that the referral strategy during the launch was a strategic one as is the current decision to shift into a mass market advertising plan. The company was unsure about the sales volumes when it was launching its phones and the invite system helped manage its supply chain. That it lured customers in with a unique purchase experience was a bonus. “As a new brand, we weren’t sure how well received our products would be. We used the referral system to match supply with fluctuating demand. Fortunately, the system worked well as it helped in keeping our inventory in check while creating a positive recommendation chain that quickly went viral. The invite system made our products exclusive and generated a lot of buzz,” says Agarwal. It is now time to scale up and improve brand awareness. Agarwal says that he wants the new campaign to educate users about the brand and the OnePlus community. “We have expanded the scope to penetrate new user groups and experiment with new marketing channels to check their effectiveness. We have roped in Amitabh Bachchan as he is one of the most consistent performers and is also tech savvy.” The new ads indicate that the brand is also hoping to walk the thin line between premium and mass market categories. Bachchan as KBC anchor appeals to the masses. But the ads pitch OnePlus against Apple, Google and Samsung, thereby positioning it within the premium category. Bachchan walks the same line as a superstar with mass appeal and “his personality resonates well with our brand mantra. With him on board, we are looking to expand our community,” adds Agarwal.

The company has invested in improving its supply chain and production capacity and has recently started making its phones in India. It adopted a similar strategy in other markets too; in Europe it partnered with carriers like O2 (UK) and Elisa (Finland) to make demand more predictable and stable. Now after three years with operations in over 30 countries, the company has dropped the invite-led sales strategy with the launch of the OnePlus 3 model late last year. However OnePlus plans to continue selling online, the only change being that it will now offer smartphones on its own e-commerce website. Can OnePlus move away from being an experiential purchase and a novelty for first time buyers to the conscious choice of feature-hungry smartphone users? Agarwal believes it can by keeping an unwavering eye on the product. “With a product first philosophy and one premium flagship smartphone a year strategy, our products are synonymous with our brand. Our constant endeavour is to offer the best device experience and improve engagement with our users. Since inception, our fans have been instrumental in refining products through constant feedback and driving word-of-mouth awareness,” says Agarwal. He is confident that the community-based brand philosophy will continue to drive sales, but then loyalty is a fickle friend in the mass market.

Join For Free Learn how to troubleshoot and diagnose some of the most common performance issues in Java today. Brought to you in partnership with AppDynamics. “No provision need be made for the user to program the return of registers to the free-storage list.” This line (along with the dozen or so that followed it) is buried in the middle of John McCarthy’s landmark paper, “Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and Their Computation by Machine,” published in 1960. It is the first known description of automated memory management. In specifying how to manage memory in Lisp, McCarthy was able to exclude explicit memory management. Thus, McCarthy relieved developers of the tedium of manual memory management. What makes this story truly amazing is that these few words inspired others to incorporate some form of automated memory management—otherwise known as garbage collection (GC)—into more than three-quarters of the more widely used languages and runtimes developed since then. This list includes the two most popular platforms, Java’s Virtual Machine (JVM) and .NET’s Common Language Runtime (CLR), as well as the up and coming Go Lang by Google. GC exists not just on big iron but on mobile platforms such as Android’s Dalvik, Android Runtime, and Apple’s Swift. You can even find GC running in your web browser as well as on hardware devices such as SSDs. Let’s explore some of the reasons why the industry prefers automated over manual memory management. Automatic Memory Management’s Humble Beginnings So, how did McCarthy devise automated memory management? First, the Lisp engine decomposed Lisp expressions into sub-expressions, and each S-expression was stored in a single word node in a linked list. The nodes were allocated from a free list, but they didn’t have to be returned to the free list until it was empty. Once the free list was empty, the runtime traced through the linked list and marked all reachable nodes. Next, it scanned through the buffer containing all nodes, and returned unmarked nodes to the free list. With the free-list refilled, the application would continue on. Today, this is known as a single-space, in-place, tracing garbage collection. The implementation was quite rudimentary: it only had to deal with an acyclic-directed graph where all nodes were exactly the same size. Only a single thread ran, and that thread either executed application code or the garbage collector. In contrast, today’s collectors in the JVM must cope with a directed graph with cycles and nodes that are not uniformly sized. The JVM is multi-threaded, running on multi-core CPUs, possibly multi-socketed motherboards. Consequently, today’s implementations are far more complex—to the point GC experts struggle to predict performance in any given situation. Slow Going: Garbage Collection Pause Time When the Lisp garbage collector ran, the application stalled. In the initial versions of Lisp it was common for the collector to take 30 to 40 percent of the CPU cycles. On 1960s hardware this could cause the application stall, in what is known as a stop-the-world pause, for several minutes. The benefit was that allocation had barely any impact on application throughput (the amount of useful work done). This implementation highlighted the constant battle between pause time and impact on application throughput that persists to this day. In general, the better the pause time characteristic of the collector, the more impact it has on application throughput. The current implementations in Java all come with pause time/overhead costs. The parallel collections come with long pause times and low overheads, while the mostly concurrent collectors have shorter pause times and consume more computing resources (both memory and CPU). The goal of any GC implementer is to maximize the minimum amount of processor time that mutator threads are guaranteed to receive, a concept known as minimum mutator utilization (MMU). Even so, current GC overheads can run well under 5 percent, versus the 15 to 20 percent overhead you will experience in a typical C++ application. So why you don’t feel this overhead like you do in a Java application? Because the overhead is evenly spread throughout the C/C++ run time, it is perceptibly invisible to the end users. In fact, the biggest complaint about managed memory is that it pauses your application at unpredictable times for an unpredictable amount of time. Garbage Collection Advancements Sun Java’s initial garbage collector did nothing to improve the image of garbage collection. Its single-threaded, single-spaced implementation stalled applications for long periods of time and created a significant drag on allocation rates. It wasn’t until Java 2, when a generational memory pool scheme—along with parallel, mostly concurrent and incremental collectors—was introduced. While these collectors offered improved pause time characteristics, pause times continue to be problematic. Moreover, these implementations are so complex that it’s unlikely most developers have the experience necessary to tune them. To further complicate the picture, IBM, Azul, and RedHat have one or more of their own garbage collectors—each with their own histories, advantages, and quirks. In addition, a number of companies including SAP, Twitter, Google, Alibaba, and others have their own internal JVM teams with modified versions of the Garbage collectors. Costs and Benefits of Modern-Day Garbage Collection Over time, an addition of alternate and more complex allocation paths led to huge improvements in the allocation overhead picture. For example, a fast-path allocation in the JVM is now approximately 30 times faster than a typical allocation in C/C++. The complication: Only data that can pass an escape analysis test is eligible for fast-path allocation. (Fortunately, the vast majority of our data passes this test and benefits from this alternate allocation path.) Another advantage is in the reduced costs and simplified cost models that come with evacuating collectors. In this scheme, the collector copies live data to another memory pool. Thus, there is no cost to recover short-lived data. This isn’t an invitation to allocate ad nauseam, because there is a cost for each allocation and high allocation rates trigger more frequent GC activity and accumulate extra copy costs. While evacuating collectors helps make GC more efficient and predictable, there are still significant resource costs. That leads us to memory. Memory management demands that you retain at least five times more memory than manual memory management needs. There are times the developer knows for certain that data should be freed. In those cases, it is cheaper to explicitly free rather than have a collector reason through the decision. It was these costs that originally caused Apple to choose manual memory management for Objective-C. In Swift, Apple chose to use reference counting. They added annotations for weak and owned references to help the collector cope with circular references. There are other intangible or difficult-to-measure costs that can be attributed to design decisions in the runtime. For example, the loss of control over memory layouts can result in application performance being dominated by L2 cache misses and cache line densities. The performance hit in these cases can easily exceed a factor of 10:1. One of the challenges for future implementers is to allow for better control of memory layouts. Looking back at how poorly GC performed when first introduced into Lisp and the long and often frustrating road to its current state, it’s hard to imagine why anyone building a runtime would want to use managed memory. But consider that if you manually manage memory, you need access to the underlying reference system—and that means the language needs added syntax to manipulate memory pointers. Languages that rely on managed memory consistently lack the syntax needed to manage pointers because of the memory consistency guarantee. That guarantee states that all pointers will point where they should without dangling (null) pointers waiting to blow up the runtime, if you should happen to step on them. The runtime can’t make this guarantee if developers are allowed to directly create and manipulate pointers. As an added bonus, removing them from the language removes indirection, one of the more difficult concepts for developers to master. Quite often bugs are a result of a developer engaged in the mental gymnastics required to juggle a multitude of competing concerns and getting it wrong. If this mix contains reasoning through application logic, along with manual memory management and different memory access modes, bugs likely appear in the code. In fact, bugs in systems that rely on manual memory management are among the most serious and largest source of security holes in our systems today. To prevent these types of bugs the developer always has to ask, “Do I still have a viable reference to this data that prevents me from freeing it?” Often the answer to this question is, “I don’t know.” If a reference to that data was passed to another component in the system, it’s almost impossible to know if memory can safely be freed. As we all know too well, pointer bugs will lead to data corruption or, in the best case, a SIGSEGV. Removing pointers from the picture tends to yield a code that is more readable and easier to reason through and maintain. GC knows when it can reclaim memory. This attribute allows projects to safely consume third-party components, something that rarely happens in languages with manual memory management. Conclusion At its best, memory management can be described as a tedious bookkeeping task. If memory management can be crossed off the to-do list, then developers tend to be more productive and produce far fewer bugs. We have also seen that GC is not a panacea as it comes with its own set of problems. But thankfully the march toward better implementations continues. Go Lang’s new collector uses a combination of reference counting and tracing to reduce overheads and minimize pause times. Azul claims to have solved the GC pause problem by driving pause times down dramatically. Oracle and IBM keep working on collectors that they claim are better suited for very large heaps that contain significant amounts of data. RedHat has entered the fray with Shenandoah, a collector that aims to completely eliminate pause times from the run time. Meanwhile, Twitter, and Google continue to improve the existing collectors so they continue to be competitive to the newer collectors.

Published on April 03, 2017. YouTube is searching for ways out of an abrupt advertiser revolt that has seen some of the world's largest marketers suspend spending with the platform. Credit: Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg Most Popular Marketers will soon have more options at their disposal when advertising on YouTube, which said that it's working with third-party brand-safety vendors like DoubleVerify and Integral Ad Science to assure marketers that their budgets won't wind up paying for ads on violent, offensive or otherwise unsavory content. YouTube parent Google said it will work with companies that are accredited by the ad industry's Media Ratings Council for new verification tools, but didn't provide an exact timeline for when those tools would be available. The full list of approved partners was also not immediately available. After the rise of fake news sites where marketers were attacked for appearing, companies like DoubleVerify pounced on the opportunity to provide media-agency networks such as GroupM with better brand safety tools. Since press reports of ads supporting terrorist video on YouTube sparked a full-fledged advertiser revolt last month, the focus has shifted. Advertisers including AT&T, Verizon, Pepsi and Procter & Gamble have frozen spending on YouTube because of brand safety concerns. Agency holding companies WPP and Omnicom said they'll provide brand safety tools for marketers so they can still advertise on YouTube, but it's unclear whether or not their clients' concerns have been assuaged. Although Google's move seems like a step toward resolving YouTube's sudden ad crisis, DoubleVerify said it's unsure what's supposed to happen next. "As of yet, we haven't received any details on the solution that they are planning," a DoubleVerify representative said. Related Stories The 'Brand Safety' Narrative Tearing Up YouTube Is Amusingly Wrong Did JPMorgan Chase Just Start A Digital Advertising Revolution? Omnicom Will Sort Through YouTube Videos to Make Sure They're Appropriate for Brands The move comes nearly two weeks after YouTube Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler said the company would be conducting an extensive review regarding its advertising policies and tools. Mr. Schindler publicly apologized shortly after reports that major brands had their ads run on offensive or extremist content on YouTube. A Google representative told Ad Age its recent move is an integration and not an API that any outside vendor can use, meaning that its brand safety tools will be separate from WPP and Omnicom's offerings.

IMAGE: Vedica Scholars Programme for Women has helped many girls find what they really want or are suited to do. Photograph: Representational image from Rediff Archives Tania Tauro was always clear that she wanted to be in the development sector. She worked for two NGOs, both in Mumbai, but left as she felt she needed to hone her business knowledge and understanding.   Now, after completing the 18-month Vedica Scholars Programme for Women, a unique alternative to the traditional MBA, the 27-year-old joined Tata Trusts and is working on the India Health Fund.   Her salary jumped three times from what she had earned before joining the programme. She is excited at the opportunity to work at Tata Trusts and to use the knowledge she  gained through Vedica programme -- a blend of business education and liberal arts.   Similarly, Mayuri Dixit, after earning her engineering degree from BITS Pilani and working with an analytics firm in Mumbai, completed the Vedica programme. She has now joined Google in Hyderabad.   While she continues to work in analytics, she feels on her own, her chances of joining a company like Google were very slim. The programme, she says, exposed her to a whole new range of ideas and thinking that her engineering degree couldn’t have. She also reels off names of girls who have madee career switches after the programme.   Twenty-seven graduates of the first batch of Vedica scholars -- all of whom have now been placed -- have seen a sharp jump in their salaries too, compared to their previous jobs. The average salary of the incoming batch of girls was Rs 4.8 lakh, which shot up to Rs 10 lakh after completing the course. The highest salary package is Rs 22 lakh.   But more than salaries, the programme has helped many girls find what they really want or are suited to do.   For instance, Gouri Rajagopal graduated with an engineering degree from the NIT in Trichy in 2014. After working for a year with a data analytics firm in Bangalore, Rajagoal decided to go for the Vedica programme. She has now joined 9.9 Media founder Pramath Sinha to work on a project in the social sector. Till she joined the programme, Rajagopal felt that she couldn’t have a full-fledged career in the development sector as engineering and various science streams were her only exposure.   “Now I know it’s possible to have a career in the social sector -- something I have always been passionate about,” she says. Rajagopal, who is single and supports herself says her salary is adequate to live comfortably on.   The 18-month residential programme is targeted at getting more women into the corporate workforce and preparing them for the inevitable challenges they will face in their careers. On successful completion of the programme, the scholars are awarded a postgraduate certificate in management practice, offered jointly by the Vedica Foundation and the Sri Aurobindo Centre for Arts and Communication.   The founders say many women who work hard to build their corporate careers often tend to leave them after marriage, particularly after having children. That’s one of the reasons one sees very few women in the corporate space in India -- especially at senior levels.   “The idea is to help women sustain their careers even after these milestones," says Anuradha Das Mathur, one of the founders of the programme.

This is especially a good way for web developers and website administrators to present something a little out-of-the-box and entertain their audiences — two birds in one stone! Sites like Google and Reddit have made it a tradition to present some April Fools pranks for their users, but it seems like every website is in on the action. Let’s take a look at some of the best of them! Hulu TV streaming service Hulu celebrated April Fools by launching a snarky prank. According to The Verge, Hulu announced that they will be launching a service called “Hu,” in which they will be cutting down TV episodes to just 8 seconds, to better fit the people’s “shortened attention span.” To show off their commitment, they even had Hu versions of Seinfeld and The Mindy Project, among others. Netflix The current giant of streaming services, Netflix got their April Fools’ on by presenting what they called “Netflix Live.” It’s got a catchy name — as it is with most things when you add the word “Live” to it — but what exactly is it? No one really knows, except that we got Will Arnett narrating the most mundane things. Whether this is just a way to pass April Fools or a program that they will actually keep making still remains to be seen. Netflix got Will Arnett narrating ‘very ordinary things’ in ‘Netflix Live.’ [Image by by Ethan Miller/Getty Images] Duolingo Duolingo is an excellent way to learn a new language. It has a decent selection of courses, it is free, and the community-based approach makes it a bit more accessible. That it got itself a lot of users is in itself impressive, as learning a new language can be daunting at times. As a treat to fans this April Fools, they released a new set of learning cards… for an Emoji Language Course! Imagine the surprise, huh? The upside is we could probably at least understand the upcoming Emoji Movie better. Reddit Reddit had a beautiful April Fools in 2015 when they released “The Button,” a sort of social experiment that eventually became an unforgettable part of the website’s history. Have they outdone themselves this year? Perhaps not, but their offering is somewhat similar in philosophy. They put up something called “Place” this year, which is basically a large blank canvas where each user can place a pixel of color every five minutes. It’s a social experiment in a similar vein as The Button, what with hierarchies popping up and teams and connections made mainly because of the colors each user favors. However, Reddit being Reddit, it’s not really unusual to see genitals drawn all over “The Place.” Alexis Ohanian (L), Co-founder and Executive Chair of Reddit, with Alexia Tsotsis (R), Co-editor at TechCrunch. [Image by Noam Galai/Getty Images] Google Google perhaps won April Fools this year — unsurprisingly. It’s not only that they had a ton of these pranks scattered around their network of services for users to find, it’s also because they actually are funny. Take for instance their promotion for the new selfie stick for the Chromebook. Or even “Google Gnome,” a smart robot gnome that takes care of your lawn! They’ve also made Google Maps into a fully functioning game of PacMan back in 2015, in what was later dubbed as “Pac-Maps.” This year, they released the “sequel” for it as Google Maps became a haven for digital ghosts again, this time inspired by the video game Ms. Pacman. Needless to say, these pranks are just a way of developers to have fun for April Fools’ Day. Once again, these examples prove that comedy indeed demands creativity — with the most creative presentations being the most rewarding.

Google Carrier Services moves to the Play Store, but it does absolutely nothing (for now) Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/03/13 10:16am PDTMar 13, 2017 68 Plus 1 on G+ 159 Share on Facebook 69 Share on Twitter Total Shares296 Applications Google News Many device manufacturers, including Google, choose to update pre-installed applications through the Play Store. This way, individual apps can be updated without the need for an entire system software update. Another pre-installed app, simply called 'Carrier Services,' has been moved to the Play Store. The app description says it, "helps carriers provide mobile services using the latest networking capabilities," and that it includes support for "enhanced features in the Android Messages app." An update for the application is currently rolling out to Android phones worldwide, seemingly regardless of the device's carrier. You might be thinking that this app has something to do with RCS, or perhaps the RCS Business Messaging feature that Google announced last month. Well, right now it does exactly nothing. The APK contains only a dummy service, which simply returns a value of null. Not very exciting, is it? You can find Carrier Services on the Play Store below, and feel free to join in the many people giving it funny reviews.

Zorak✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵉᵛᶦˡ This one was pretty funny actually https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/96d04f2fc0983ee23ed3edd0fd2eda555fe0c89954480c6d19b4a0aedbe2e5d4.png someone755 One word: Overdone. Zorak✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵉᵛᶦˡ Also: Abasement an entire species i.e a bullfrog in heat. Sexual appropriation of amphibians at it's finest. Revolting! Billy Bob Jimmy Joe The fake reviewers are just trying way too hard to be funny. I use to enjoy these comments on Amazon but it's getting old. 30014 If it's getting old why are you still reading them? Don't complain about something you can easily control. When I don't like something I avoid it. Billy Bob Jimmy Joe Same reason why you read and responded to my comment: We are all free to do so. 30014 Your dumb a$$ is the one that said it's getting old. People with common sense don't things they don't enjoy and then complain about it. I don't know how you can do it but I suggest you focus on getting some common sense. catalysto Why can't you read something and comment on how you think it's lame? Is that against the law? someone755 It is on this site. Always has been, the argument is "if you don't like something avoid it" no matter how idiotic that suggestion might be in most scenarios. 30014 Nobody wants to hear or read about pointless and useless complaints. Billy Bob complaining about fake reviews isn't going to stop them from happening. If he already knew they were fake why even bother reading them. Here hold this "L". someone755 If I know the current presidency is a mess why bother even reading about it or complaining? Here hold this salt. 30014 I say screw Trump just like I say screw you. I don't complain about the current president because I know that won't accomplish shit. All I can do is vote when the time comes. Here hold this L. someone755 You just complained about him. Here, hold this insult I've said already. 30014 Because people don't care that you think it's lame the same way they wouldn't care if you thought it was cool. catalysto So nobody cares about anyone. Got it. Portzblitz You had a point, roughly.. but now you're just being a dick. 30014 I wasn't being a dick, I was speaking truth. I'm guessing you're a millennial that needs coddling to make it through daily life. Oh no, I offended someone with my slightly harsh words. Life is gonna kick your a$$. Hayden Pearce It's OK to say ass on the Internet hun. 30014 Some of these people in charge are real sensitive and I didn't want my comment getting deleted. I've come across more than 1 site where they have flagged ass. Cat Astrophy Everything gets old eventually. Fresh to others. VAVAMk_2 Yay...? Is that the right reaction I should have to this?

Jens Törnblad I wish these were hidden on the Play Store and just updated in the background along with other apps. It's ridiculous when you read 1-star-reviews of people who wants to uninstall. saf1927 Yeah, reading some of the reviews under Google play services is ridiculous. If only they knew the majority of the apps they use wouldn't even work without it. Wiktor Olejniczak (Witus13) *Google: We didn't release any app that's related to messaging this week... Here you go EcE Wrong... look up Area 120 - Uptime Sadly, they did. Wiktor Olejniczak (Witus13) Gosh.... EcE Yup, somehow it hasn't been reported here. I would've thought is ridiculous enough to be news worthy, even though it's an iOS app only.... for now. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It was a 20% project from some Googlers not really a Google product EcE Project from a Google incubator employees can use 20% of their time to work on... Potato/potato.

Kieron Quinn There were actually some changes to the resources: https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/5z54il/google_carrier_services_update/devfewb/ Martin Huber Wifi calling is now working in germany! :) Martin Huber Carrier: Telekom Phone: Pixel https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2344a8159cc4882641813c4a40051b686bf89df5e17197140fbf0714c6b8671e.png Rod I don't speak Klingon. lowlevel you are neither witty, nor funny. please go away. ePoch 270 I thought he was funny, therefore you are ignorant. Please go away. Rod 17x1 Not a bad score. Serge Cebrian of course it was funny ... Daniel Tiberius K'plah! mike shwilly Should have just called it Allo2 ProductFRED Hopefully this manages/consolidates support for carrier services such as Wifi Calling and VoLTE (which are both software-based and don't need special hardware). abqnm I expect this will be at least somewhat true. It will be used to consolidate all IMS registration and usage. Here are the permissions it asks for right now: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d970fdfde0681d063ed0f70bda67d92d7088c77400606f45f8691aab7686c4d4.jpg Amit_N another f**king server side update is likely for this then mattcoz It never connects to a server, so no. Ramon Those Play Store reviews though. 😂😂 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d550e2de41dde0b3620719674deb8f05caf511f681b92111e9ee2b3e385bbf0a.png Dn Bro I'm puzzled. How are there screenshots for this app? All I had was the option to update it. It doesn't create a new icon or anything. I must be missing something. Corbin Davenport They are screenshots of a sample app using Carrier Services. Sruly J They updated the Play Store listing with new pictures and​ a better changelog. RockAndRock For RCS ? *-* Thor I really hope they can push VoLTE support through this. There's an operator in India called Jio which is a 4G only carrier so calls can only be made via VoLTE or through one of their own (shitty) app. Nexus 5X is able to do VoLTE calls just fine but but 6P can't. demarcmj Typical Google changelog too... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5689a2bba6d810d9183e39b66258949bf18ae36446915720cedad147ffc251c7.png thartist Downloading new features ASAP! My Android version now says 8.0.1, is that right guys? Rawhi Mohammad I got Nougat on my nexus 5! Bewear I got Android O Preview on my Nexus 4 thanks to this. ChPlaya Play Store Free : https://chplaya.blogspot.com/ kapilmachi It's not available in my country. I'm sad. Really. Victor Garcia Why are you sad? 4Ui812 What's new. Lots of new features, and a couple bug fixes. And yet it doesn't do anything. Google has really out done themselves this time. Maybe this app is meant to be used exclusively with the Fixel. FRGuzman It does whatever your imagination is capable of dreaming so they are not lying, this update added a lot of new features. Rapper_skull Not available in my country (Italy). FRGuzman How are you coping with not being able to do anything with this app? Rapper_skull I would like to experiment penis enlargement, Mars flights and paranormal activity in my house too. Markus Birth Play Store Web says "incompatible with all your devices" and my phone says "not available in your country" (Germany). That is with my BlackBerry PRIV. However, a friend with a Pixel phone - same country, same network - got the update. Zavon Update version added Enhanced LATE for me on Project Fi Midnitte That's been there for quite a while. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f2d5db44e15b23ef8aa044d8e79b12f5904fc99f44f244b50fbb8dea1deb9b63.png Zavon Not for everyone. yochanan No, it didn't. You just now noticed it. FYI, It's only available when connected to T-Mobile. Zavon Would've known it was there. Checked the setting everyday since they announced they were testing. I know it only works in T-Mobile right now, I keep up with Android news. yochanan Coincidence. There are no code changes in the update, it did nothing to your phone (yet). Enhanced LTE works without the update. LineOS for exynos! Sounds to me that is going to speed up updates​ of carrier locked phones. If they can install all the apps that we don't need this way... ast00 Gotta love the changelog :D "Lots of new features" PVL_93_RU The day when Google moves all the essential Android system elements into the Play Store and will be able to update them automatically (or in conjuction with Play Services) will be a truly magnificent day, when the only reason to even have system updates will be to renew security bulletins Peter @Corbin which version did you decompile? TedPhillips I was not familiar with the 'interactive elements' section of the play store listing, is it new? Bewear Well, this app is as useful as carriers themselves, it seems. Filipe Santos On Portugal I got this update. I'm using Vodafone and I got the RCS message from Vodafone when Messages for Android updated. IVBela Absolutely nothing? Well, it caused me a few hours of laughter while reading the reviews. :D Hexlattice Hahaha... Those reviews remind me of the Bic gel pen for her on Amazon. Or the banana slicer! AQ Another service to run in the background? I may buy flagships (3GB RAM S6 atm) but another 50-100MB app I can't control adds up to reloading switching between two large apps. I'd like to use my RAM for my apps... & with the G6 & S8 dissapointingly still sporting 4GB I find myself bothered by this news of yet another system service to eat away at what I pay for & try to make use of. yochanan No. It was already installed on your phone if you got the update. It's just updated via the Play Store now instead of firmware OTA's. JZ Vaterlaus This was my review: LinkedIN, move over. I've bin job hunting four a whiul now, without mutch sucess, but now that gOogle has there own carrier services app l can finally use googul to search 4 jobes. Sooo much better than all those other carrieer search sights and online job boreds, thay just cannt complete. Dicky Apriady Got my pixel battery drown from 100% to 50 % in 3 hours (ini iddle condition). After uninstall it, my phone back to normal. Eric Stealth DO NOT UPDATE... This is a fake Carrier Update... Just look at the dummy photos in its description. Kevin Davis RCS, for all you tinfoil hat wearing types. Lol. Iuli S. George After I updated Carrier services I got a notification saying "installing instant apps". Before I didn't have the option, now I checked Settings>Google and is there. eoffreynurton Thanks a lot, looking for a Google, i find it this site: http://downloadplaystorefree.com/how-get-apps-in-play-store-for-download-free/ when explain how get the apk file if you don´t have in your smartphone, very useful! Regards reggjoo That's Google, when will the app be ready, so we can be guinea pigs again. Đức Thành Cool! I guess because the carriers are so incompetent at doing their own jobs, Google decided to take it into its hands. Hopefully the carriers will actually cooperate with Google to help themselves. chplaypc Hopefully the carriers will actually cooperate with Google to help themselves.

Many have already received the latest software, and more are being released every month. Back in August Google released Android 7.0 Nougat for select Nexus smartphones and tablets. Now, other smartphones are slowly getting the same treat. Here’s what Motorola owners need to know. The company recently released an extensive list of 15 devices that will get updates soon. So far we’ve seen a couple arrive, and more are coming. Like the unlocked Moto Z Android Nougat release, the G4, and even the Verizon DROID. Although this is only Android 7.0 and not the latest 7.1.2 Nougat. Read: Android 6.0 vs Android 7.0 Nougat: What’s New So Far Android 6.0 Marshmallow hit Motorola devices before almost any other phone, and the same is happening with Nougat. They’ve been working hard to deliver timely updates for customers. The company recently confirmed some general update details and shared more information for users. And now we have a full list of incoming Motorola Android Nougat updates. February was a successful month for the company. From releasing a slew of update to launching the new G5 budget smartphone. Owners can keep track of current or upcoming updates at the Motorola blog which details everything you need to know. Users with select Moto Z devices, Moto G4 and others have all received Android 7.0 Nougat. So what’s next? Read on to find out. While we don’t have an actual release date for each device, more are arriving as 2017 continues. It’s now March, and the unlocked Moto Z received Nougat last month following the Verizon model. Some were starting to get impatient, but we now have more good news. In late November select users with the Moto Z started getting Android 7.0 Nougat early. Then within a few days it was officially confirmed by both Motorola and Verizon. Select unlocked models, like the Play, are still waiting. At least for now. Shown above, is the Moto Z and Moto Z Force DROID update. It arrived earlier than many expected, thanks to a quick delivery by Verizon. Alternatively, the impressive Moto G4 and G4 Plus received Android 7.0 Nougat in Brazil and India recently. We saw the updates start for the G4 on December 15th, and the US release quickly followed. Here is Motorola’s official changelog and breakdown regarding the software update. Motorola Android 7.0 Updates According to a Motorola spokesperson, consumers can “expect to see Android N on the Moto Z family and Moto G4 beginning in Q4.” That ended up being accurate, as they started in November and continued through December. However, not all devices received the update. Moto has been all over the place in terms of who or what gets it, and where. Those with the Moto Z, Moto Z Force DROID, Moto Z Play or the Moto G4 will see Android 7.0 Nougat first, if they haven’t already. Then the company will move on to other devices. Recently Motorola posted an official Android 7.0 update list. Many devices we expected to see updates are included, but “new” phones like the 2015 Moto G aren’t included. Meaning a phone that isn’t even two years old will not see an update. Here’s the full list: Moto G (4th Gen) Moto G Plus (4th Gen) Moto G Play (4th Gen) Droid Turbo 2 Droid Maxx 2 Moto X Pure Edition (3rd Gen) Moto X Style Moto X Play Moto X Force Nexus 6 Moto Z Moto Z Droid Moto Z Force Droid Moto Z Play Moto Z Play Droid As you can see most smartphones released at the end of 2015 or in 2016 are included. Flagships like the DROID Turbo 2, and even the DROID Maxx 2. However, the 2015 3rd Gen Moto G will not see an update, and none of the Moto E devices will get Android 7.0 Nougat. With the Moto Z done and now the G4 and G4 Plus getting it, expect the company to move on to carrier models and the Moto X next. Alternatively, those with newer budget devices, like the Moto Z Play DROID, can expect it to arrive any day now. As of March 8th Verizon is updating the Z Play DROID, which is nice to see happen for a phone that isn’t a flagship device. What’s New in Android Nougat Our link at the top of the page is an in-depth look at Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow vs Android 7.0 Nougat, and everything that’s new and different with comparison photos. It goes over many of the key changes for Motorola users. Some things will look a little different, but everything should be included. As a quick recap, the Motorola Android 7.0 update will bring improved performance, better battery life with “Doze” features, split-screen multitasking, the recent apps button works like ALT+TAB and switches between the last used apps, and much more. Google has over 50 big changes in Android N. Like faster app installs, which are also smaller, a new JIT compiler, improved graphics and performance with the Vulkan API, revamped notifications with quick reply from the pulldown bar, customizable quick setting tiles and so much more. All of that and more will come to the Moto Z and Moto G4. Not to mention things like a better and improved Google Search using the Google Assistant with machine learning, number blocking and call screening. Again, this is only Android 7.0 Nougat, and not the latest 7.1 software that Pixel users are enjoying. Expect that at a later date. Of course most of this will come with Motorola’s improvements baked in. Like hands-free controls, always-on display and more. Samsung has TouchWiz, HTC uses Sense UI, and LG has their own interface over stock Android as well. Not every new feature will be implemented, others will be changed, but this looks to be one big and exciting update to the Android operating system for Motorola users. Motorola phones run nearly stock Android, so this should be a fast and painless software update. And while some may experience issues, overall it should be well worth the wait. Motorola Android 7.1.2 Update Release Date Now that Android 7.0 Nougat is on a lot of Motorola devices, owners are starting to look ahead to what’s next. That’s a good thing to do, but don’t get too ahead. Google recently unveiled Android 7.1.2 as the first big update to Nougat. A release date is still a few months away. It’s only available as a limited beta for select devices right now. Expect it sometime this summer. In the meantime, expect Motorola and carriers to continue working together for general Nougat updates. All devices should see updates within the next few months, including the Moto X. Once that’s all done, Motorola can move forward with Android 7.1.2 Nougat and beyond. At the same time, we’re now starting to see rumors about Android O. Which is crazy considering most still haven’t received Nougat which was released in August of 2016. Stay tuned for more details. 14 Responses 10/06/2016 ADITYA GSS Reply Will moto g4 plus get updated with moto g4 and moto Z’s ? 10/06/2016 ADITYA GSS Reply Please reply 10/15/2016 j Reply Yes 10/15/2016 k Reply Nice 10/17/2016 Amandeep Reply Is moto g3 get nougat update?? 10/21/2016 Amandeep Reply Please reply. 10/22/2016 Md got Reply I hope it’s allwse very helpful 11/01/2016 Dilip Reply Nougat update will fix cast screen and LED notification in Moto Z Play? 12/12/2016 manshi singh Reply it’s styles and good looking phone and also at that time’s best phone….

Almost the end of March and my Moto 4G in the USA still has not gotten the update. Going to ‘About Phone’ in settings, says no update available. Wouldn’t be surprised if it would be July or later at this rate. An Android phone is a computer. When there are vulnerabilities and feature updates, it is available very soon for desktops and laptops, but for phones, we are still in this stupid dated model. 04/02/2017 Sarah Davidson Reply I did the loaded the update today and now my phone is not staying connected to wifi.

According to a number of reports, the firm is pushing out OTA updates for the Pixel C and the Nexus Player. The news isn't entirely unexpected, as we were already expecting that the update would arrive tomorrow. Factory images haven't been published just yet, so it seems likely that those will show up then. Android 7.1.2 Nougat is what Google is calling a 'maintenance update' for the OS, meaning that front-facing features are minimal. The Pixel C gets the Pixel Launcher, and some handsets, like the Nexus 5X, will get support for fingerprint gestures. The update also marks the end of support for both the Nexus 6 and 9; however, those devices will continue to receive security updates. If you don't have a supported Nexus or Pixel device, don't expect to see it anytime soon. As of almost four weeks ago, usage of Android Nougat saw 133% growth to 2.8% of Google Play Android devices, but still, the latest version, which is 7.1, saw a 33% increase to 0.4%. Still, don't get too comfortable with the latest version of Nougat; Android O is coming in the third quarter of this year, and the Developer Preview is already available.

But now, in 2017, things are changing. There’s been a renaissance in chatbots, which have evolved from being a ‘toy’, to being used for serious things – like applying for asylum, or appealing parking tickets. At the same time, it’s increasingly common to control computers and mobile devices through voice commands. Most phones ship with a built-in voice assistant – like Siri, Cortana, Google Now, and Bixy. The same is true in the home, with the spread of Google Home and Amazon Echo. Ever been to a tech festival? TNW Conference won best European Event 2016 for our festival vibe. See what's in store for 2017. LEARN MORE The problem is that making smart, interactive assistants for these platforms is pretty tricky. Even if you’re building something on top of Amazon’s pre-existing tech, it takes time and effort. Now, it’s about to get a lot easier, thanks to the California-based NoHold. We’ve written about it before. Its flagship product, Albert, allows you to upload a body of structured text and transform it into a chatbot. So, if you were to upload a book on C++ programming, it would create an artificial C++ expert, which you could ask questions. Now, it’s released a connector for Amazon’s Alexa. So, you can now grill that same C++ chatbot through your Amazon Echo. NoHold have a plan for small businesses, as well as a free tier. NoHold envisions people using Albert to create guides to their home, which can then be accessed through Amazon Echos on the premises. Which, to be fair, would be amazing for Airbnb guests who want to find out how the coffee machine works, or how to turn on the hot water, but don’t want to trouble the host. In a statement, Diego Ventura, CEO and Founder of NoHold said, “I am looking forward to the day when everybody with a QuickStart account and an Amazon Echo will be able to expand Alexa’s capabilities in minutes without having to be a programmer.  With a bit of luck, that moment is around the corner.” Read next: The history of selfies is a real exhibit in a posh London museum Apps Share on Facebook (50) Share on Twitter (129) Matthew Hughes is a reporter from Liverpool.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars TECH Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable MORE Entertainment Science Health Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars Tech   Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable More   Entertainment Science Health Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Android 7.1.2 rolling out first to Pixel C, Nexus Player JC Torres - Apr 2, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Android Nougat might sound like old news, now that Android O has formally been teased in a developer preview. But that’s not to say that the nutty treat isn’t going to have one last hurrah before it goes out of season. Following the second beta that was released just a few weeks ago, Android 7.1.2 is finally rolling out in its final form, at least according to some user reports. Strangely enough, the final Android Nougat update is apparently landing first on the Pixel C and the Nexus Player, two of Google’s older devices that are in dire need of some love. That is probably appropriate considering the update does have more in store for these two than the other Nexus and Pixel devices. Or at least it does for the Pixel C. Android 7.1.2 finally brings the new Pixel Launcher to Google’s last remaining supported tablet, along with the new way to reveal the app drawer. For those who are not yet aware of it, the Pixel Launcher does away with the icon that you usually tap to show the app drawer. Now you just swipe up from the navigation bar. Another major UI change in Android 7.1.2 for the Pixel C is the recent apps visuals. Instead of the card-based “tickler” style used on phones, Pixel C users will now see a grid of the 8 most recent apps instead. It’s definitely a better use of the larger screen real estate. Whether this particular change comes to the Nexus Player has yet to be reported. Strangely enough, there aren’t any reports yet of Android 7.1.2 landing on supported Nexus and Pixel phones. That should follow soon, especially since the update apparently includes the April security update as well. The update is also special for Nexus 6P owners as it finally brings fingerprint gesture to the device. Bad news for owners of the Nexus 6 and Nexus 9, though. It seems that Google isn’t budging from its unspoken stance that neither of these two will get any Android 7.1.x version. In fact, the Nexus 6 was “rolled back” from Android 7.1.1 to Android 7.0, causing no small amount of consternation among users.

AccuWeather's Android App Updated To Version 4.0 With A Material Design Interface Michael Crider Follow View All Posts 2016/01/04 11:33am PDTJan 4, 2016 53 Plus 1 on G+ 37 Share on Facebook 0 Share on Twitter Total Shares90 Applications News AccuWeather is one of the most popular dedicated weather apps in the world - on the Play Store it's racked up somewhere between 50 and 100 million downloads, and that's just for the free version. The latest update actually started sometime around Christmas, and it's been going out in Google-style stages, so it's taken us this long to spot it. Version 4.0 significantly updates the user interface of the app to bring it more in line with Material Design standards... sort of.    Old design above (via the Internet Archive), new below.    The app's update text says that AccuWeather is using Google's design guidelines, but our own Material Design guru Liam Spradlin says that the changes miss the mark in a lot of ways. The look of the new cards is non-standard and the icon assets aren't aligned to the pixel grid, among many other complaints (though he does say that he digs the toolbar). AccuWeather users would seem to agree, with many negative reviews being posted to the Play Store listing in the last week or so. Specific complaints include less information on the redesigned widget and missing saved locations. It looks well above the level of grumbling that seems to be inevitable when any popular service is redesigned. Griping aside, the new version of the app seems to be running quite well on my phone, and the slide-out location menu and other visual elements are more or less where you'd expect them to be. The free ad-supported app is compatible with just about everything, and the $3 "platinum" version has been given the same visual refresh.

The old app was hideous and went with dat old Holo UI for way too long OligarchyAmbulance It's funny how we used to pine for Holo apps, and now we hate it! Mayoo it's called evolution diggie No, it's not. DN Uhm, no. Reginald Spence II I think it's more of the fact that Android users want apps to look like the rest of the OS. Consistency. It's a bit annoying to have Material Design manifest itself across the OS and most apps, yet have a few apps STILL stuck on Holo. YouNex holo darkblue is fine but the app itself was hideous marcusmarcus2 I noticed this update last week when my widget stopped working. Had to remove and re-add the widget. They only have 1 widget to choose from now. I miss the choices of widgets in app, it looks much nicer. I think we will get more widget choices back in another update (I hope) blahmoomoo One great difference I've noticed: the app no longer has a several second long loading screen when opening it. At least, I think that's the case, since my own phone hasn't gotten it yet. jawsnnn People are not only pissed off because of the widgets. I personally hate the major feature set they dropped in favor of a"cleaner " design. No graphs, no news, no indication of what the numbers on daily hourly tables mean (Hi? Low? Avg? Realfeel? What?) SidG Hi jawsnnn, Graphs are coming soon, stay tuned! Personally, I think that the graphs on the old version desperately needed a makeover and I wanted the material design graphs experience to be great for our users. Look around in different apps that have graphs: they never really nail it because it's either too much or too little. The optimist me believes that the AccuWeather Android team will crack it! The views, opinions and positions expressed by me are mine alone, and do not necessarily reflect the views, opinions or positions of AccuWeather. jawsnnn That's great to hear. I would have said that the app should have been updated when it was ready with additional features, not less - but at that point I would just be cribbing about a free app that has several alternatives in the market. Les H It definitely looks better, but the forecasts are still destroyed daily by Wunderground. Biagio Marino Finally! HiroRoshi Unfortunately fewer widget options. Can get the older one from Amazon app store if you like the older widgets. JW I am staying with Weatherbug since I think it's more accurate. demarcmj Least AccuRate forecast though. Weather Underground (or Weather Timeline with Weather Underground selected as the data source) all the way! philosopher_Mk It's funny how most of the reviews on play store are negative about new design. Michael Henrich People don't like change unless it is their own idea. LectricLarry Michael... I think folks accept/like change when it is for the Better! Material/Flat design is Not for the better. It's just dumbing down the internet. But, it is easier to design! Creativity? Out the Window. Sounds like many 'new' things.. No talking.. Texting! No more music.. Just electronic cussing! No more rich photography... Just pixels on paper. Maybe that goes back to.. No more Art in schools... Just testing! Michael Wunderground also updated their UI very recently. tim242 And made the app worse. vomer Weather Timeline is all you need : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samruston.weather Well worth the $1 PuzzledObserver Agreed 100% I tried many weather apps, including paid ones. Some are heavy on cosmetic but light on weather (HD Widgets, Beautiful Widgets). Some are overkill on weather features that I don't need. Weather Timeline is the on I use now. For clock & weather widget. Đức Thành Simple Weather is pretty great, too. Its notification widget is even better than the one of Weather Timeline. Glock That's because HD Widgets and Beautiful Widgets aren't specifically weather apps though - they link into apps like Accuweather and so on for that functionality, but they are primarily homescreen widget apps (offering clock, date and weather display). Atom That's great. Thanks for mentioning it. Channel 2012 Looks worse than before. Just use the website. The0x539 I also dig the toolbar. Eric Moe I had to Greenify the new version, it has been consistently the highest battery usage app on my phone since the update. I don't even have auto updating, widgets, or notifications. Looks pretty though... Veronica Accuweather, the biggest data miner in the world, and funny enough, many other apps use their info. buckley101 Proof? SidG Hey All! AccuWeather Android PM here! Love all your comments and it surely keeps us informed about the various features that you guys are looking for. Someone in the comments rightly mentioned that the app is super fast, and that's because the app has been rewritten from scratch! Graphs, current location on-going notifications, and more widgets are coming soon. It only gets better from here! Cheers! The views, opinions and positions expressed by me are mine alone, and do not necessarily reflect the views, opinions or positions of AccuWeather. K.P. Smith Excellent, then you're just the person to give this info to... 1) Bring back the dark widget. I prefer dark widgets. I stopped using your widget because it's white, on my black background, it looks silly. 2) Allow the widget to be resized again. The old version allowed this. On screens with a high pixel density, such as the Nexus 6P, a 4x1 widget looks out of place because it leaves a 1x1 blank spot next to it. On the old version I could just resize the widget (using Google Launcher) and make it a 5x1 widget which takes up the entire horizontal line and looks better. The new version does not allow me to resize the widget to 5x1. It's not a Google/Android problem either, I can download your competitors apps and still resize their widgets to 5x1 without any problem. Until you guys sort those out I've moved on to looking at other options and have landed on weather timeline. I'm using them as my widget but still have your app installed because i like your weather alerts, they are reliable. SidG Hi K.P Smith, Thank you for that information! I think there has been a resounding need for a dark widget, which I definitely have on my list to run by the team. That's an interesting aspect that you bring up about the nexus 6P. we don't have that device in-house yet, and I will try to look at this on the emulator. Widgets have been tricky, and we want to make a better experience on that one for sure. The views, opinions and positions expressed by me are mine alone, and do not necessarily reflect the views, opinions or positions of AccuWeather. Voidheartd I've disabled updates and will be looking for a replacement because of this. White backgrounds kill my eyes. I have to deal with the stupid white everywhere all the time "style" (is making a dark theme option available that hard?) enough as it is without adding more. This is disappointing because the old widget is perfectly sized for my homescreen layout and gives most of the info I need about weather, and I liked that the notification bar is dark as well, which I assume is also gone. SidG Hi Voidheart, Looks like there are some who are on the light side and some on the dark side :) sorry, couldn't resist! I take your feedback and will look into the additions we can bring on this one. BHT Dear SidG, The app is not working for me as it fails to detect my location. Trying to search for my location also does not work. Judging from the comments on Play Store, I'm not the only one. Please look into it. SidG Hi BHT, I'd love to have this resolved for you. Can you please email [email protected] ? Please mention that you're a commenter from Android Police and I will get on it personally to look into it. Without logs on this issue, we are effectively running in the blind sometimes. Logging is now on my product backlog! :) Ten Bears @disqus_oZIcNB6CGY:disqus, ur app is lyk really boring. where r the animations and sounds and rly anything exciting? Also ur app needs more cars. Juss put cars all ovr it. REd cars, blue cars, white cars, maybe a yellow car even. I kno wut ur thinking, but VROOM VROOM! Rich You should have waited until it was more fully baked before pushing the update. The old app was dated but worked well. Due to the notification being locked to a specific location I've moved to Weather Timeline. I do find AccuWeather location to be a bit more accurate so might switch back when this is fixed. A dark mode is a must as well. mgfjd12 I installed Nougat on my S7 and the accuweather app doesn't play nicely. My phone keeps telling the app has a high battery usage. I have uninstalled and installed several times and the phone kept telling me the same. Could you please test the app with nougat? Ashish Hooda A hidden game in app also It is a phone comparison app and its UI is very unique,you will definately like it.It is something which you wouldn't have seen before. this is the app link https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ezydev.phonecompare Cory Wilson So what happened to landscape mode? Doesn't work on my phone or tablet unless I force it. No one can seem to get the weather app perfect. WeatherBug is what I'm using currently and honestly would be perfect if they'd just ad an adfree option Michael Oghia I like the app a lot, but I'm not digging the redesign at all Filipe Santos I just think the font its too big on my Nexus 5, it seems that I have some eye problem that I need to zoom in 150%.... MIKEEEEE one more reason why i miss MY-CAST dearly. accuweather took a so so app and made it worse. wumderground updated as well. now i have 2 crappy material design paid weather apps. marcusmarcus2 Anyone else having an issue with AccuWeather on Android Wear? Any time I launch it, it just says "Data Unavailable" LectricLarry Anyone who would rather look at the bottom examples is..is... Aesthetically Challenged! MD and all it's Ilk are insulting. I am not an orange rectangle! buckley101 Are you high? LectricLarry So... You like solid, bright white topped with a solid, squared cornered, not gradient, no borders panel. I like seeing the clouds and some animation .. Something to appease a gifted mind.... Oops! sam madina What happened to the forecast graph on the widget? Without that, the widget is a weather rock.

Mother presses lawmakers for dock standards after Lake of the Ozark electrocutions Associated Press 7 hrs ago (…) Docks at Lake of the Ozarks in a Post-Dispatch file image. Docks line the shores of the Lake of the Ozarks, as seen in this Google satellite view image. JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. • A central Missouri mother of two children killed in 2012 when they were electrocuted while swimming at Lake of the Ozarks wants state lawmakers to enact laws that could prevent similar tragedies. Angela Anderson of Ashland told KOLR-TV that legislators must improve safety standards at boat docks and marinas. Her push for the changes followed the deaths of Alexandra Anderson, 13, and her 8-year-old brother, Brayden. Both were fatally shocked on July 4, 2012, by power running to a dock they were swimming near on the lake. "Both of my children were dead. That quickly," Angela Anderson told KOLR. KOLR reported that since 2015, four people have died at the lake from electric shock drowning. Democratic state Rep. Jake Hummel of St. Louis is sponsoring a bill that would require new docks and those changing ownership to meet new standards and have safety inspections. He told KOLR that there are about 20,000 docks at the lake. The measure also would include no-swimming policies around docks and require defibrillators on Missouri State Highway Patrol boats. Anderson said she would like to see Ameren Missouri, which owns the lake, do more to ensure safety. She sued Ameren Missouri over the electrocutions, but lost in a case that went all the way to the Missouri Supreme Court.

Docks line the shores of the Lake of the Ozarks, as seen in this Google satellite view image. JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. • A central Missouri mother of two children killed in 2012 when they were electrocuted while swimming at Lake of the Ozarks wants state lawmakers to enact laws that could prevent similar tragedies. Angela Anderson of Ashland told KOLR-TV that legislators must improve safety standards at boat docks and marinas. Her push for the changes followed the deaths of Alexandra Anderson, 13, and her 8-year-old brother, Brayden. Both were fatally shocked on July 4, 2012, by power running to a dock they were swimming near on the lake. "Both of my children were dead. That quickly," Angela Anderson told KOLR. KOLR reported that since 2015, four people have died at the lake from electric shock drowning. Democratic state Rep. Jake Hummel of St. Louis is sponsoring a bill that would require new docks and those changing ownership to meet new standards and have safety inspections. He told KOLR that there are about 20,000 docks at the lake. The measure also would include no-swimming policies around docks and require defibrillators on Missouri State Highway Patrol boats. Anderson said she would like to see Ameren Missouri, which owns the lake, do more to ensure safety. She sued Ameren Missouri over the electrocutions, but lost in a case that went all the way to the Missouri Supreme Court.

Android O Developer Preview Supports Nexus 5X and 6P, Nexus Player, Pixel and Pixel XL, and Pixel C Michael Crider Follow View All Posts 2017/03/21 10:12am PDTMar 21, 2017 42 Plus 1 on G+ 189 Share on Facebook 93 Share on Twitter Total Shares324 Android O News Nexus 5X Nexus 6P Nexus Player Pixel Pixel C Pixel XL As the world turns, so too does the cycle of Android updates. The first part of 2017's version bump, known only as Android O for the time being, was just announced. And just like the last two years, developer preview versions will be available for some of the latest officially supported Google hardware. This year that list includes the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Pixel, and Pixel XL phones, the Pixel C tablet, and the Nexus Player Android TV set-top box. You can download the new images here. The Nexus Player is the big outlier here, since it's coming up on three years old. But despite being officially discontinued (and one of only a handful of standalone devices that actually use the platform), it's still the only retail Android TV hardware Google has ever produced. The Nexus 5X/6P generation and the Pixel C are both from late 2015. The Nexus 6 phone and Nexus 9 tablet, both still supported as of Android Nougat, are not part of the program. Note that these releases are the first Developer Preview, not part of the wider Android Beta program, so current devices can't be upgraded with an over-the-air download. You'll need to download the images and flash them manually with Fastboot on a local PC. This initial developer preview is not intended for daily use - though a lot of enthusiasts are going to update their phones anyway - so prepare for a few bugs and incompatible apps as Google and app developers work through the teething troubles.

Thought we would be totally shafted. Max Johnson Next year. keithzg Well, yeah, by that point the 5X and 6P will be as relatively old as the 6 and 9 are now—as will the Pixel C, although we'll see if Google actually drops dev preview build support for that (it's still for sale, after all, which in some senses keeps it newer). Sam ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Android Oatmeal™ Geoff Johnson Oatmeal Cookie Daniel Tiberius Oatmeal Cream Pie Iamsecond Android Orangina, with new 'shake to wake' feature. AFDTechTalk To flash or not to flash, that is the question Đức Thành The answer is always to flash, unless you can flash an even newer version. Besnik Rrustemi Holly Shit,no sleep Tonight :D someone755 Or if Google decides that you just can't have your newer version. Rest in peace, N6 owners' support for Google. Rest in peace. Nick I want to flash, but then I realize how irresponsible that would be. Time to download! Kieron Quinn Two preview/developer previews two days in a row, has this ever happened before? Felix ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Could you flash the new images on 7.1.2 Dev Preview 2 (NPG47I)? Dfigs23 Can you flash this on a 5X that is on the beta? With Nexus toolkit on an unrooted and never unlocked 5X? chandrizzle The key here is that you need to be bootloader unlocked. The rest doesn't matter because you'd flash the partitions through fastboot. Since you're locked, it will wipe your device data when you unlock. 4Ui812 I still say it should be called Orifice. ninjustin This is kinda random but is the Nexus Player worth it? I think I could like a Chromecast with a remote and a UI. However when it came out it seemed a bit too pricey. atlouiedog Right now? Not unless you can find one really cheap, assuming you can even find one for sale. The last couple of times I've seen them available the price was too close to the more capable MiBox. I like mine a lot, but if it died I don't think I'd replace it with another for more than $30. keithzg Problem from my perspective is the MiBox is hellishly expensive for some reason here in Canada, I've never seen it for a reasonable price. But then of course the Nexus Player isn't being sold anymore, and the Shield is even more expensive. When normal people ask me what they should buy I'm like "shit, dunno". catalysto Depends... If you just want a Netflix/YouTube streamer machine, it's fine. However, if you have local media or want to use Plex, I would say definitely not. It's not powerful enough to handle all media types, and that makes it buggy and crashy. Also, the remote is a horrible piece of cheap, hollow plastic and feels terrible to use. But if you can find it for, like... $10... Go for it! Really, the only good Android TV device at the moment is the NVIDIA SHIELD. Impulse_Vigil I'm thinking of replacing mine with an NV Shield.. Just waiting out some of the software and add ons they promised for this year, curious to see how Assistant will work on it. catalysto Yeah, that should be cool! Derek Sava I just did this a month ago. It has been great. Much faster and a few more native apps - primarily Amazon video. Really the Nexus player is great as well. Impulse_Vigil Yeah if I didn't have Amazon video on a Fire TV Stick (Prime preorder sale) *and* on my TiVo already I would've probably grabbed the Shield earlier. Would still be nice to consolidate, I'd likely pull that Fire stick out w/a Shield instead of a NP. keithzg I personally have no issues at all, although I don't use Plex, I use Kodi, and I have it hooked up via an ethernet cable. But even full blu-ray rips from discs of my own (that I do at higher bitrate than the scene standard, because I am a silly person) play flawless. I keep considering a Shield, but it wouldn't​ get me anything other than better support for games—which I already have a Steam Link for. That's probably what I'll end up doing if/when the Nexus Player no longer cuts it, but for now I have zero complaints (this was far less true when I was using it over wireless). Impulse_Vigil Hmm, I might need to try an adapter on mine, I have the Steam Link, TiVo, and several other things on a switch... Need to see if there's a free port. Are there any specific adapters to get? I was trying some out on my Pixel and that thing is super picky about which it'll work with. keithzg The specific one I used was https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00RM3KXAU/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1 from Amazon.ca, looks to also be up at Amazon.com: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00RM3KXAU/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1 Yeah a while ago I started just buying 8-port switches, since 5-port ones always seem to end up a port short ;) although I think right now all I have hooked up to the one on my projector shelf is the Nexus Player, Steam Link, and my flatmate's borrowed PS4. Impulse_Vigil Nice, Plugable seems to be getting a lot of USB accessory stuff right, one of the Type C adapters I looked up for the Pixel was from them too. Thanks for the link. There were two more devices on the the switch (SmartThings hub and BD), so it's full, but the old Blu Ray player hardly needs to be connected all the time... Think I'm gonna swap it for the Nexus. catalysto Yeah, I know Google has made a lot of improvements to the software. In the early days, the NP had lots of issues, but sounds like it's stable now! Woo! I guess I should have mentioned that it's been quite some time since I've used one. [M] " It's not powerful enough to handle all media types" What do you mean? I own a Nexus Player and it works very well. Not counting a few anime releases that use some very new codec (10 bit?) it plays everything without an issue. Mostly I watch TV series (720p) but it can handle 1080p bluray rips without any issue. I use Kodi, I have an USB ethernet adapter attached and I stream all the movies I watch from my NAS through samba. djakdekiel I can't unlock bootloader because LG locked unlocking after repair :/ JSo I'm assuming you are talking about your Nexus 5X? How can they lock unlocking? LoadGamePL After replacing the motherboard due to bootloops, the phone can't remember it's status, so after each reboot phone changes bl status to locked. This happens to all Nexus 5x that had their motherboard replaced. LG sucks. And because this guy here is from Poland, Google won't give a shit about him, sadly. We only have LG here. Max Johnson I guess more reason for me to stay away from LG. LoadGamePL Yeah, after fantastic Nexus 4 and 5 they literally forgot how to make phones. They can't fix bootloops since G4! Pessimippopotamus GDI Djakdekiel ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yep, I can't do anything. I bought Nexus5X not form playstore but normal shop. Alex Dueppen Assuming it's a 5X you're talking about, I would try contacting Google. Freek Smulders https://www.reddit.com/r/nexus5x/comments/5hj0r0/bootloop_after_lg_replaced_mainboard_bootloader/ This will work destinyhud Nexus player gets it probably because thats their only Android Tv device to test the software and they might have thought lets release it, if they had nexus player 2 i bet the original nexus player wouldn't even have gotten it Impulse_Vigil Or maybe they just bought some NV Shields... :P (I have a NexPlayer btw) destinyhud with no access to nvidia drivers its for for them to develop. they basically have to hack in to it. simple solution is to use nexus player Sam Del Valle https://media.tenor.co/images/f35c5a5b72f78a56c7680873206a3fbf/tenor.gif Steven Clarke No Nexus 9 =[ Googles least favorite child.

Then they had to make another announcement just on Friday that they were delaying the release of the update to the rest of the wearables since they discovered a bug. But now it looks like the game is back on as six more smartwatches have started receiving the update as well. This time around, the devices receiving the Android Wear 2.0 update are: Polar M600, Fossil Q Wander, Fossil Q Marshal, Nixon Mission, Michael Cors Access Dylan, and Michael Cors Access Bradshaw. The first three that were already updated from last week are: the Fossil Q Founder, TAG Heuer Connected, and Casio Smart Outdoor Watch WSD-F10. This means there are 10 more smartwatches to go since Google previously announced that 19 devices will be able to receive the update. They did not specify what the bug was that forced a couple of days delay for the rollout, but it must have not been a major one since the update seems to be doing just fine now. The long delay for the arrival of Android Wear 2.0 has been attributed to a lot of factors, which includes the approval process for each of the OEMs. But we’ve already gotten used to the long waiting period for major updates from Android so this isn’t really new. If your smartwatch isn’t in the list of the 19 that will be upgraded to Android Wear 2.0, then you might want to consider getting a new device if you really want what this update brings. But if not and your smartwatch is still functioning properly, then no need to do so.

Skip to content Home News Sports Metro Plus Politics Business Entertainment Opinion Editorial Columnists Jobs Sections Search for: Gadgets Five ways to improve your search rankings through social media Published April 3, 2017April 3, 2017 Share Tweet Pin it +1 There are various ways to improve your search rankings like optimising your content for Google. However, a way that is ignored or scarcely exploited to increase search rankings is social media. In fact, some people don’t know that social media can serve this purpose. Not to worry, here are five ways you can use Twitter or Facebook to improve the search rankings of your website.  Reduce word count The word count for different social media platforms varies. For Facebook, you have the leeway to write as much as you want, while for Twitter it is 140 characters. But know that the lesser the characters, the more likely it will attract readers, thus improving your search rankings.  Give your followers a reason to read your content The post you share on social media must be very interesting to make your friends or followers click and read. Preferably, you should distribute posts that offer solutions to problems.  Enhance profiles for keyword searches Don’t ignore your profile if you want to increase your website ranking via social media. You should search for keywords relating to the content of your website and include them in all your social media profiles. Also, use these keywords, when captioning your pictures, especially on photo sharing website. Use keywords to drive content In order to increase visibility on search engines through your social media accounts (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube), you should create content for particular keywords. If you run a tech website, you can search for keywords related to technology and develop content that features that keyword. Tell your audience what you want them to do Sometimes you have to tell your target audience what you want them to do. This is why you should use words or phrases such as ‘See’, ‘retweet’, ‘kindly follow back or like’, and ‘check out’. This will engage your followers who in turn check out what you are sharing.

We look at the best jokes of the gaming world. Every year, a multitude of tech and gaming companies participate in April Fools day by trying to prank as many people as possible with the silliest-yest-still-somewhat-believable announcements they can think of. We scrounged the internet to find some of the best jokes from our favorite companies. Did you get fooled? Hearthstone: Mankirk's Wife Hello children! Another Doyle Discovery! The Professor has datamined a new card that was missed from yesterday's reveal! pic.twitter.com/z5chjeBbRX— Hearthstone (@PlayHearthstone) April 1, 2017 Hearthstone's April Fools joke references a long-standing World of Warcraft quest, which involves finding NPC Mankirk's Wife in the barrens. The vagueness of the quest led to dozens of players spamming chat with cries of "Where is Mankirk's wife?". Google Maps: Ms. Pac Man Google loves to transform its maps app into an interactive game on April Fools day. In years past, we had Pokemon, but since Pokemon Go has basically made that a real thing, this year we got Ms. Pac Man. Nvidia: The GeForce GTX G-Assist Nvidia's joke introduced the GTX G-Assist, which is billed as an artificial intelligence that uses the power of your GeForce graphics card to help you out in games. Pizza guy at the door in the middle of a Rainbow Six: Siege online game? Plug in the G-Assist to take over. Need to get past a particularly difficult boss monster? G-Assist is there. The more powerful your graphics card, the smarter the AI! Sega: 8-Bit Bayonnetta Sega's April Fools joke is great because it's not actually a joke: it's a real thing you can play! 8-Bit Bayonetta is a low-def de-make of Bayonetta, imagining what the game would look like if it came out in the era of the Sega Genesis. Get it on Steam right now! CD Projekt Red: Tub Geralt Our Consumer Business Analysis and RNG Divisions are thrilled to announce a new, unique and exclusively limited figure of Geralt! pic.twitter.com/AA8azWioVQ— The Witcher (@witchergame) April 1, 2017 Of all the jokes we saw yesterday, this was the one we most wished was real. CD Projekt Red revealed an exclusive new Witcher 3 figuring featuring Geralt of Rivera taking a bath. BlizzCon: Choose your Own Adventure Can't attend BlizzCon this year? No worries, as Blizzard has announced a brand new way of attending: textual attendance. Clicking through the prompts plays out a kind of choose-your-own-adventure of what things may have been like if you were actually able to score tickets this year. Better luck next year! Turtle Beach: F-bag Never stop gaming. Never go hungry mid-match again. Introducing the Turtle Beach Feed Bag. We call it the F-Bag: https://t.co/PHdg7rN9Tc pic.twitter.com/hkJ3hDQkTk— Turtle Beach (@turtlebeach) April 1, 2017 Don't you hate it when you're gaming, and you have to take your hands off the controller to stuff food into your gob? Well, Turtle Beach's April Fools Joke offers a solution, with the "Feed Bag" or "F-Bag", which is exactly what you'd think it is. Those were our favorites from the joking season. Were there any we missed that you liked better? Till next year!

USA TODAY Marco della Cava 11 hrs ago SHARE SHARE TWEET SHARE EMAIL $1T infrastructure crisis threatens safety and the economy 7 reasons you could get less Social Security © Provided by USA Today SAN FRANCISCO — A self-driving car flipped on its side seems guaranteed to make humans think twice about riding with a robot. Popular Searches The Bank Of Japan 8301 = 37,100.00 0.00 0.00% Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd CCLAY ▼ 8.24 -0.06 -0.72% Wesfarmers Ltd WFAFF ▲ 32.46 +1.68 +5.46% Woolworths Ltd WOLWF ▲ 19.48 +0.15 +0.78% Never mind that Uber's accident last weekend in Tempe, Ariz., was the result of a human failing to yield and smacking into the autonomous Volvo. Despite the lack of serious injuries, that image alone raises questions about both our acceptance of self-driving tech as well as Uber's rabid rush to bring this new age of mobility to life. "We may lose 35,000 people a year to traffic deaths, but if 10 people are killed by autonomous cars, we'll be freaking out," says Karl Brauer, director of content at Autotrader and Kelley Blue Book. That it happened to Uber seems to be a bit of bad luck blended with hubris, adds Brauer, noting that in some 2.5 million miles and years of testing the most that has happened to Google's autonomous cars are low-speed bumper dings. "Google has taken the slow and steady approach, and they're the leader," he says. "Uber is a company that leverages technology (to connect drivers with riders) but they're not a tech company. They seem to be frantically transforming themselves into something they're not by nature." Uber responded to a request for comment with confirmation that its cars will be back on the road late Monday in Arizona and Pittsburgh. John Krafcik, CEO of Alphabet's veteran self-driving project Waymo, meanwhile tweeted out a photo Monday of a self-driving car testing in a winter wonderland. "Snow practice!" he wrote, with the location identified as South Lake Tahoe. Testing in inclement weather is considered the Achilles heel of autonomous vehicles because their sensors can't see the road and must rely on highly detailed 3D maps. Waymo, started as Google's self-driving program, seems to be upping the ante just as a rival is struggling. Uber's battle against  its rival's seven-year-old program is "almost existential," says Gartner auto analyst Mike Ramsey. "They're trying so hard, but this can't be done overnight even if you hire the smartest people in the world." Ramsey says accidents are part of any experimental programs, and there's no reason to think Uber would be exempt. But the Arizona incident puts a spotlight not only on the technological hurdles that remain but also the psychological chasm that still exists between today's deadly tolls and a potentially safer but autonomous future. "There's already a huge issue when you hand over the driving to someone else," he says. All told more than 30 companies large and small — from Audi to Waymo — are working on the hardware and software components of self-driving cars. Many companies point to 2020 or 2021 as an internal goal for creating a commercially viable autonomous car, one that likely would first appear as part of a ride-hailing service. But that goal is contingent on other factors, including cohesive federal rules on testing and deployment, agreement on insurance issues, and infrastructure needs such as clear lane markings. In that sense, Uber may have egg on its face today, but there is still time to determine the big winners in this lucrative mobility revolution. "This is transformational stuff, but I'm skeptical it'll evolve fast," says Ramsey.  A fierce race to autonomy In some ways, Uber's headlong rush into the self-driving car race echoes Icarus, whose waxen wings melted as he soared toward the sun. Despite having no expertise in the space, two years ago the ride-hailing giant decided it would take on tech companies and automakers alike in the complex quest for autonomous vehicles, a goal that would eliminate a big cost to Uber rides — the driver.  Uber raided Carnegie Mellon University for its best roboticists, spent $670 million to buy autonomous truck company Otto, and, last August, proudly started picking up Pittsburgh passengers in robot-driven cars. But fast forward and the wax on Uber's wings appears to be melting. Key members of its self-driving car division have left, and a recent report on tech website Recode described the company's autonomous car team as being in a "mini-Civil War." Waymo is suing Uber, claiming that Otto's key sensor technology was stolen by Otto founder and ex-Google employee Anthony Levandowski. And then comes the embarrassing accident in Arizona. Even the path to that crash was bumpy: hours after it started testing its self-driving cars in December, the California Department of Motor Vehicles told it to halt because it hadn't received the proper permit. Instead of complying, Uber sent its fleet to Arizona.  California's DMV, which granted Uber approval for testing earlier this month, is "contacting Uber and working with our partners in law enforcement to find out more about the crash involving a self-driving vehicle in Arizona," says Calif. DMV spokeswoman Jessica Gonzalez.  Uber, which was founded in 2009 and is now valued at close to $70 billion, became the biggest startup in history thanks in part to playing hardball with drivers, municipalities and state officials.  Its contentious relationship with its drivers is well-documented, with many filing lawsuits to be considered employees in order to receive better pay and some benefits. But those have paled next to damaging allegations about a male-chauvinist company culture that resulted in CEO Travis Kalanick going on the hunt for a chief operating officer while former U.S. attorney general Eric Holder conducts an internal investigation. Last month, Uber admitted that it would stop using a technology called Greyball, first reported by The New York Times, to deceive city officials who wanted to take rides in an attempt to regulate the service.  Uber ultimately has little choice but to continue its feverish quest for proprietary self-driving tech. Although the private company's finances are a mystery, industry experts question whether the company is subsidizing rides to grow market share, much as it did recently in a failed attempt to break into the Didi Chuxing-controlled Chinese market. Eliminating the driver would improve Uber's business model, but significantly less so if that self-driving technology had to be purchased from a competitor. "Uber remains a huge player (in autonomous car research) just given that huge valuation alone," says Brauer. "But they're also not the only ones working on this stuff." There is also, for Brauer, a strong sense of comeuppance in the Arizona accident.  "They've had this irreverent, shoot from the hip attitude about so many things, saying they'll just hire their way into this or buy their way into it or they'll ignore the (state) rules," he says. "It just makes me think that if you're Travis, and you're 40 and are worth tens of billions, maybe you have an overblown sense of what you can do. We will see."

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Samsung It turns out the Galaxy S8’s best new security feature isn’t very secure at all Chris Smith @chris_writes March 31st, 2017 at 11:02 AM Share Tweet Back in 2011 when Google introduced a new Android security feature called Face Unlock, users were able to fool it with a simple photo. Almost six years and many Android updates later, and it looks like the Galaxy S8 suffers from the exact same problem. Don't Miss: This is probably going to make Galaxy S8 owners furious Earlier this week, Samsung unveiled the Galaxy S8 series, confirming pretty much every rumor that had been floating around out there. Among the new features Samsung detailed on stage were the phone’s security measures. The Galaxy S8 can be unlocked using a variety of methods on top of the plain old password/PIN option. Your fingerprint, iris, and face can be used to unlock the handset. Some of these methods can also be used for logging into other services or authenticating mobile payments. But a video shows that the face unlock trick, as exciting as it might seem, can be tricked with a simple photo. It might not work on the first try, but the facial unlock protection can indeed eventually be bypassed with a picture. You’ll be able to try it yourself as soon as you receive the device, and you should totally avoid enabling this feature if you’re able to use a photo of yourself to unlock it. Otherwise, anyone with access to your phone and a picture would be able to unlock the device. Samsung might fix the issue in the future, but keep in mind that it might be a while before updates reach your phone. Android users know the drill. For the time being, Samsung is fully aware that face unlocks aren’t as secure as iris or fingerprint scans. The company admitted as much to Mashable, explaining that Samsung Pay can be used in combination with face unlocks. Apple is also rumored to bring iris and face unlock features to the iPhone 8, but existing rumors says the front-facing camera will have a 3D sensor capable of measuring depth. That might be one way to prevent people from using photos to unlock the phone. Meanwhile, you can check out the video below to see someone trick the Galaxy S8 with a photo.

Android Wear 2.0 update is arriving on six more watches, but still no mainstream ones Richard Gao Follow View All Posts 2017/03/31 5:57pm PDTMar 31, 2017 17 Plus 1 on G+ 37 Share on Facebook 62 Share on Twitter Total Shares116 Android Wear Google News Yesterday, Google finally gave a reason on why most Android Wear watches still haven't received the long-awaited 2.0 update: "a bug found in final testing." Some commenters speculated that this might have something to do with Snapdragon chipsets, given how the first few watches that received the update used chipsets from other manufacturers. That being said, five of the six watches on today's list sport the Snapdragon 2100. This news comes courtesy of our pal Ernest the community manager over at Google's Android Wear support forums. Without further ado, here's the list: Polar M600 Fossil Q Wander Fossil Q Marshal Michael Kors ACCESS Bradshaw Michael Kors ACCESS Dylan Nixon The Mission We already wrote about AW2.0 going out to the Polar M600, which also happens to be the only watch on this list that isn't powered by a Snapdragon 2100; it has a MediaTek MT2601, which no other Android Wear watch uses. Fun fact of the day right here. Those of us with more mainstream offerings like the Huawei Watch and Moto 360 2nd Gen are still out here waiting. I guess it's good that Google's making sure the final software is bug-free, but us techies are an impatient bunch.

My watch was amongst the 1st batch to get it a few days ago, and I got it the very 1st day it was announced, late afternoon. But they said the rollout will go until this upcoming Tuesday. And I didn't get it while checking. It just popped up and downloaded. Sam Yay finally for the Mission!!!! :D I feel like that's a pretty mainstream one, no? Orlando aka Pixel XL I'm getting mine fixed and sent back, my pins were corroded... Wouldn't charge! Ammy <-By working on Facebook I'm making $90 to $120 per hour.

They "cleaned" the pins... Sent it back... Still wouldn't charge... They finally replaced after I sent it in again. Frustrating to be without the watch for a few weeks but the new one seems to be holding up pretty well after a month... Orlando aka Pixel XL I haven't even gone scuba diving or snorkeling yet.. I'm worried about it even lasting... WTF, they cleaned it? How did your know it wasn't brand new? Impulse_Vigil It uses pogo pins? Do they sit right against the wrist? I noticed on my new ZW3 they're sort of inset a little on the casing bit I'm still concerned about it long term, as much as I like ASUS products their support has never been great. Orlando aka Pixel XL Yup jstew182 Yeah I haven't worn mine in any water at all...Not even the shower. I am not a fan of the pogo pins...Had a similar issue with my original lg g watch when it first came out. Nixon sent a brand new one back to me the second time tho. It was in new packaging and never opened before. I'm hoping it was an early manufacturing defect causing the pogo pins to corrode and it won't be an ongoing issue. Hopefully the next iteration of the watch will have wireless charging to alleviate this issue all together. Daisy <-By working on Facebook I'm making $90 to $120 per hour.

The Mission is very well known in that line of people, or at least a load of strangers I have met have said on mountains or in the sea "Hey, that's that Nixon!". rohiggidy ignore the shitty headline. Android blogs think android oem watches = mainstream and watch maker watches = DOA Sootie Has anyone actually got the update yet though? Mine still hasnt :( boop While my watch hasn't been 'yet another battery headache' it's starting to become 'yet another update headache' and I can't see myself getting another one until they sort that out. JD Eh it's ok Google has More important stuff like April fools gags to work on. mattcoz Yes, because they only have a few developers and can only work on one thing at a time. mattcoz Obviously an issue with the Snapdragon 400, it was already out on the new watches which have the 2100. HD Zen Watch 3? mattcoz What about it? I'm specifically referring to the new watches that launched with Android 2.0 Kyle Gospodnetich ZenWatch 3 isn't here and it's using the 2100, that's what about it. mattcoz I don't know, maybe ASUS is waiting to update all their watches at once. Joshua Hill There's obviously a lot you don't know as it was obvious from the question, even if you didn't previously know, that the zenwatch 3 was a SD 2100 device. mattcoz No shit, I don't work for ASUS. Joshua Hill You really don't know shit lol mattcoz All I can do is speculate, same as any of you. Joshua Hill Then it's not obvious if it's speculation. Only a possibility. mattcoz Ok, fine, poor choice of word, but I still believe it's the simplest and most likely reason. Impulse_Vigil Ehh... I think there's a lot more going on than holdups over specific chipsets, tho that probably played a role. I'm sure certain OEM are updating faces, updating custom apps and hardware drivers (like ASUS' programmable buttons or their and Huawei's speaker)... All of that may have not even started officially until 2.0 was final, after all the beta delays. For some reason I'm a lot more zen (no pun intended) about Wear updates than I'd be about a phone update. Maybe it's the fact that 2.0 itself will screw up as much as it improves (IMO)... Badelhas Why do you say that? Impulse_Vigil Say what? The 2.0 comment? The unbundled notifications are gonna bug the heck out of me until either I learn to keep my notification pane less cluttered (I tend to leave a ton of things there to deal with at the end of the day) or Android O improves overall notification sorting. I don't understand why they simply didn't make it an option one can toggle on/off or why it makes any more sense to do it this way on a cramped watch than it ever did on a phone (where there went the complete opposite way and notifications stack seamlessly as they should IMO). Badelhas But if you swipe left several times there's a "block this app" setting. I have several blocked. Impulse_Vigil How does that solve my notification complaint tho? That's always been a Wear feature (can/could also be set from the Wear app on phone), I *do* want to see most of my notifications on the watch tho, that isn't the issue... I just don't want five separate Gmail notifications and ten different Messages notification simply because I haven't had time to check either on any given day. (same with Calendar, YouTube, and other apps for which multiple notifications per app often pile up on my phone/watch) Scrolling thru all those is gonna be a pain, right now they get neatly bundled or stacked and I can hit the + at the bottom to expand it, and when swiping past I only need do scroll past a single Gmail (or w/e) notification... Why they took this away on 2.0 instead of making it an option is beyond me. The only saving grace here is some of the notification improvements on Android O will alleviate this (channels, being able to snooze notifications, etc). mattcoz Which would explain the Zen Watch 3 not being in this group. Impulse_Vigil Sure, maybe, and/or Huawei holding it up for their original watch even tho it was like *the* beta test device. Joshua Hill If you are only talking about watches that launched with AW 2.0 that is not enough to draw a logical conclusion that the SD 400 is the problem. If you take into account that the vast majority of SD 2100 devices have also been updated then the logical progression starts to make sense. But you must also take into account devices like the zenwatch 3. You didn't even know about it! Joshua Hill Possibly (perhaps even most likely) an issue with the SD400, but not obviously. plaisthos who cares about mainstream. It is a good sign that the non mainstream watches get good update support Milly <-By working on Facebook I'm making $90 to $120 per hour. I used to be jobless 6 months ago, but I am getting a relly good salary by doing this on-line job. I'm extremely grateful to my company and God. Should you need to get a fair quantity of wages per month like me , you're able to check my details by clicking the link below. ➤➤➤➤➤ http://www.eryihu.com/8h azag_thoth it just aggravates me because there has been a working version for the huawei watch for ever so why don't we have it? I would load the developers version but can not get my computer to recognize my watch. mattcoz The bug was likely introduced since the last preview build. Impulse_Vigil Huawei probably didn't start QC testing on whatever new faces they have until it was final (and they'd be justified)... Not an excuse but as valid an explanation as any. If the update comes out and there's no 2.0 specific faces or features they deserve a roasting tho. NexusMan "But still no mainstream ones." What the hell does that mean? Which Android Wear watches are "mainstream?" Did I miss something? I'd actually argue that the Fossil watches, as well as the Michael Kors and Nixon watches are more "mainstream" than anything from Motorola, LG, and any other tech manufacturer the writer may have had in mind. Joshua Hill You might argue that but you clearly knew what the writer meant. Thus making your question about as ridiculous as you and your post ;) NexusMan For me to "clearly know what the writer meant," would require me to somehow possess some privileged, maybe psychic access to his mind, which I do not. By me using the word "may" as in "may have had in mind," I clearly indicated that I am not totally certain...or clear...as to what he had in mind...or what he meant. Thus making you and your response to my comment as ridiculous as the title to this article. ;) Impulse_Vigil I'd be inclined to agree with ya... I can guess what Richard meant, but mainstream is definitely not the right adjective here. The Fossil watches are about as mainstream as it gets really (for Wear anyway), and I'd be surprised if Huawei actually sold a lot more watches than they did. Popular with enthusiasts != mainstream. I have a Moto and an ASUS btw so I don't have much of a dog in this fight, not in a terrible hurry to get 2.0 and it's unbundled notifications either, tho I'm looking forward to watchfaces being quicker to switch. NexusMan What's the deal with watch faces being quicker to switch? Impulse_Vigil They just are? AFAIK you can have a few preset or favorite'd and just swap from the main face to a different one at any time... Might actually be somewhat useful to have an info-dense face for the workday, a different one for night, etc. At least that's how I interpreted some of the previews and 2.0 reviews, could be mistaken. Right now in order to switch faces you need to long press and swipe around the whole list + redo any customisations, so it's hardly something you'd do on a whim. Don't tell me I'm wrong (jk, do tell), this might be one of the few things I'm looking forward to on 2.0 outside native complications. NexusMan Oh, ok. I'm running 2.0, and you know I never thought about it like that, but yes, you're right. One thing I am not liking with 2.0, however, is storage. I never could figure out why these watches don't come with more storage on board. I like to keep a workout playlist on my watch, and previously, wear music downloads were handled on the phone and it would download all that it safely could, and jus stop. Now, it is handled on the watch itself, and it downloaded until I got a storage is too low and system will malfunction messages. Argh. SO I then had to delete a bunch of watch apps. When even that wasn't good enough, I just had to delete my playlist entirely from the phone (until I have time to create a smaller version of it). Impulse_Vigil That sounds like a drag indeed, another place where Wear 2.0 seemingly went one step forward and two steps back. You generally don't want any flash media anywhere near max capacity, just like hard drives but for different reasons, tho the bottom line is the same... It'll just operate better in the long run with a good 15%+ free, so it's probably best to account for that if you need to manage it manually. NAND storage controllers need some space to manage pages and let wear leveling algorithms do their thing (in addition to standard TRIM or garbage collection commands)… Even if you never reshuffle that playlist the OS writes a little bit to storage every day/hour or just edits existing data. Seems like a bunch of things in 2.0 were tweaked with the idea of making the watches much more independent, but I doubt the majority of the market for them will ever be in people wanting to use LTE watches sans phone.

HelloGbye, Breaker, Soon and other apps to check out this weekend   skip to main content skip to main menu     Apple, Amazon and Google in the bidding war to acquire Toshiba’s flash chip unit By Christian Zibreg, Apr 2, 2017 Tweet Leave a Comment Although Toshiba saw strong overall results from its HDD/SSD business in 2016, it’s spinning off the lucrative NAND flash unit into a separate company. It’s a last-ditch effort to plug a gap after the firm reported a heavy one-off $6.3 billion loss in December 2016, prompting its chairman to resign. Korean Herald cited yesterday’s report in Yomiuri Shimbun Daily claiming that Apple, Amazon and Google are engaged in a bidding war to acquire the Japanese giant’s NAND flash unit. A very diverse conglomerate, Toshiba is Apple’s top supplier of memory chips for iOS devices and files as the second-largest flash chip maker in the world after Samsung Electronics. On Thursday, Toshiba shareholders agreed to split off the NAND flash unit and sell it. The conglomerate’s financial stability was endangered when Westinghouse Electric, Toshiba’s US nuclear unit, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after struggling with hefty losses that have thrown its Japanese parent into a crisis. Westinghouse has suffered huge cost overruns at two projects in Georgia and South Carolina. Writing down Westinghouse’s US nuclear business could see Toshiba’s total losses last year exceed 1 trillion yen, or about $9.1 billion. Shares in Toshiba have fallen more than 45 percent since late December. Valued at between $9 billion and $13 billion, Toshiba’s memory chip unit is the second-biggest in the world after Samsung’s. Now that Apple, Amazon and Google are bidding to acquire Toshiba’s flash chip unit, SK Hynix’s chances of winning the bid have been lowered. Should SK Hynix acquire Toshiba’s memory chip unit, it will become the world’s largest NAND flash maker. Here are the shares and movers when its comes to memory chips: Samsung Electronics—37 percent share Toshiba—18 percent share Western Digital—17 percent share Micron Technology—10 percent share SK Hynix—9.6 percent share Other firms expressed interest in acquiring Toshiba’s NAND flash unit, too. These include storage vendor Western Digital, iPhone manufacturer Foxconn, Apple chip maker TSMC, imaging company Canon, wireless chip designer Broadcom, the Development Bank of Japan and others. Chinese-language Liberty Times reported last month that Foxconn and TSMC could join forces in an attempt to acquire a majority stake in Toshiba’s memory chip business. Western Digital is thought to be the most attractive bidder as the two firms jointly operate Toshiba’s key NAND flash production base in Yokaichi. “Then comes SK Hynix, which can create synergy with Toshiba as the same chip makers,” said a source. Foxconn is the least attractive bidder as Toshiba and the Japanese government do not want to sell the firm to Chinese companies because of the technology leak concerns stemming from the fact that memory chips can be applied to military technology. At any rate, a successful bid by one of Apple’s key suppliers, or Apple itself, could pose a great challenge to Samsung Electronics’ leadership in the flash memory market because the Galaxy maker could easily lose Apple as its main client.

A “fascinating” (Thomas L. Friedman, New York Times) look at how digital technology is transforming our work and our lives. In recent years, Google’s autonomous cars have logged thousands of miles on American highways and IBM’s Watson trounced the best human Jeopardy! players. Digital technologies―with hardware, software, and networks at their core―will in the near future diagnose diseases more accurately than doctors can, apply enormous data sets to transform retailing, and accomplish many tasks once considered uniquely human. In The Second Machine Age MIT’s Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee―two thinkers at the forefront of their field―reveal the forces driving the reinvention of our lives and our economy. As the full impact of digital technologies is felt, we will realize immense bounty in the form of dazzling personal technology, advanced infrastructure, and near-boundless access to the cultural items that enrich our lives. Amid this bounty will also be wrenching change. Professions of all kinds―from lawyers to truck drivers―will be forever upended. Companies will be forced to transform or die. Recent economic indicators reflect this shift: fewer people are working, and wages are falling even as productivity and profits soar. Drawing on years of research and up-to-the-minute trends, Brynjolfsson and McAfee identify the best strategies for survival and offer a new path to prosperity. These include revamping education so that it prepares people for the next economy instead of the last one, designing new collaborations that pair brute processing power with human ingenuity, and embracing policies that make sense in a radically transformed landscape. A fundamentally optimistic book, The Second Machine Age alters how we think about issues of technological, societal, and economic progress.

Let me explain how billions and billions of dollars of value are going to be created in entirely new business models,” how would you have reacted? Well, maybe not, YOU, but most people? The state of the blockchain (really, decentralization) industry is at a similarly nascent stage, and the opportunities are immense. My friend, and leading blockchain industry analyst, William Mougayar (subscribe to his excellent blog), who wrote The Business Blockchain, makes this comparison frequently. I’ve co-opted it, and after attending the DC Blockchain Summit recently, I’m even more convinced of this analogy. How the industry is shaping up There are plenty of people focused on leveraging shared ledgers (aka blockchains) for efficiency gains within the largest enterprises. They should. In the short-term, there’s a ton of efficiency and waste that should be removed from the system. This is where Accenture, Deloitte, and Cognizant all live. Cost-reduction is great, but it’s not the same as value creation. And as Fred Wilson points out succinctly and with authority in his post “The Golden Age of Open Protocols,” business model innovation is more disruptive that technological innovation. Which is why I think it’s worth exploring the Blockchain Tech Stack. Understanding the stack, even in its earliest stage will help us all begin to explore where the huge value creation will occur. The Blockchain Tech Stack Full disclosure: I got the outline of the following graphic from Tom Serres (and am using it with his permission). Tom is a co-founder of Animal Ventures with Bettina Warburg (who has a great TED talk you should watch). Together, they have a fantastic Udemy course on the “Basics of Blockchain.” I took it and highly recommend it. Ok, so let’s dig in and explore this from the bottom up. Blockchains. Many people have said a blockchain is “just a database.” And that’s pretty much true. It’s a distributed database (instead of centralized) where each entry in the ledger is time-stamped and cryptographically secured and linked to the previous and following set of entries in “blocks” of transactions. This linkage forms a chain of transactions. Hence, “blockchain.”  Instead of a central authority stating “here is the state of the ledger,” the network’s contributors/participants maintain the consensus and reject anything that doesn’t fit. Having a distributed database on its own is great, but you don’t always need one, and there’s no real chance to create value (and monetize) it. For a good intro to blockchain, see Common Craft’s overview of blockchains. A bit more technical, but still consumable is this one from MIT. Storage and content. A giant spreadsheet of time-stamped transactions doesn’t really require that much storage space. You can keep that on your computer without much fanfare. But what happens when we have images, audio, video, and VR worlds running off blockchains? We’ll need those to protect media rights of creators and ensure redundancy in our systems (to avoid things like the S3 crash). Think about it this way: Most of us have unused assets that could be turned into value in the form of hard disk space. You may have a 500GB drive on your computer, but you are only using 200GB of it. So, what do you do? You can rent it out to someone like Storj (disclosure, I do marketing work for Storj and own some StorjCoin), Sia (I own some of that as well), or FileCoin. Their network protocol then pays you for hosting some of the files that people put on the network. These files are encrypted and sharded (cut up), so you only have a fraction of someone’s file and you have NO idea what’s in it.  And these files are copied to many places, so you don’t even have the only copy of it. A developer who wants to use one of these protocols as the back-end system for storing the data required in their application then pays the network via one of these coins. So you may get 1 StorjCoin or SiaCoin for hosting a file. The developer may get 1.1 StorjCoin or SiaCoin from an end consumer for the service the app provides to the end user. That .1 is the profit to the developer. These numbers are totally made up and just for example. The network doesn’t take a commission at all, which is why these networks will be able to provide the same storage as Amazon or Google for a fraction of the cost, say 90 percent cheaper. Of course, for it to work, they need hundreds of thousands of people to rent our portions of their computers. In a classic chicken-and-egg problem, those people will only come if there are developers who are building on these platforms … which they will do only if there is enough storage. You get the picture. Eventually, however, it will be worked out, and the creators of these protocols (at least the winning ones) will see the value of their limited tokens increase because of the increased demand. That’s how they will make money. Investing in the coins of the winning storage protocols now is how you can make money. For a primer on how I invest, see this post. Smart contracts. If you think about a legal contract or a business agreement, it’s essentially a series of “if, then” statements. If Party A agrees to do X, then Party B will do Y. And so on. That’s basically the same thing as software code. Put it all together. We call it a “Code of Law,” don’t we? The “legal code.” Except now, instead of having it in big volumes or stuck in contracts that are just sitting on DocuSign’s servers (eventually replaced by someone like BlockSign), the digitization of all of these assets can be programmed to have the legal and business rules associated with them directly connected to them, not sitting in a “legal silo.” I’ll give you a simple example of one I used at a site called, appropriately enough, SmartContract. Let’s say I want to be #1 in SEO for the search term “blockchain marketing,” “marketing in a blockchain world” or “blockchain + marketing” and a few derivations of that. I might find a world-class SEO person who says, “Yep, I can do that for you in the next two months and it will cost you 2 Bitcoin (or whatever).” In a traditional model, that person sends me a contract, I sign it, she does the work, and then after two months, let’s say she gets the job done. She might send me a screenshot saying, “Hey, I did it, now pay me.” I would say, “Ok, send me the invoice.” I’d get the invoice, send it to Accounts Payable, they would do a check run or whatever and eventually, maybe 30 days later, my vendor gets paid. There’s time, effort, and friction in that process. In a smart contract, we set up the rule that says, if the result for search term ‘blockchain marketing’ points to my company on May 21, then pay Sandy 2 Bitcoin. If not, only pay .5 BTC. We might agree that we will use the .json feed from Google (called an “oracle”) to serve as the arbiter, and then we would both sign it with our unique cryptographic signatures. I would put the 2 BTC into an escrow account for payment. Then, we let it run. On the prescribed date, the contract queries Google, sees the result, and the appropriate amount is released immediately (or not, if it fails). Either way, the contract is recorded in a blockchain and open to verification (here’s one I ran). Done. Basically no friction or time delay. The provider of the service, in this case, SmartContract gets a transaction fee of .0001 BTC. Do that 10,000,000 times and you have 1,000 BTC, which is $1 million dollars. Decentralized economy. A good primer on this aspect of the blockchain stack is Joel Monegro‘s excellent post on “Fat Protocols.” It’s also where we’re seeing a ton of innovative efforts and initiatives such as OpenBazaar, Fermat’s Internet of People, Steem, Synereo, uPort, Metamask, and Blockstack among many, many others. In this layer of the stack, you will have these protocols, which are basically open-source, portable, and reusable software codified rules, that replace the proprietary systems that dominate our current landscape. One of the most obvious ways this layer will be monetized is via so-called “crypto-tokens” or, the more benign, “digital assets.” There’s an explosion of conversation going on around about this now, and I will readily admit I am still trying to get my head around it. For some good primers, check out Nick Tomaino’s post, Albert Wenger’s post, and both Jake Brukhman’s  and Naval Ravikant’s excellent contributions to the eBook Blockchains in the Mainstream: When Will Everyone Else Know?, which everyone should also read. I’ve also blogged on the crypto-token possibilities more than once. If you really want to go super deep into this (which I think is a good call), you may want to attend the upcoming Token Summit in NYC in May. I’ll be there. But let’s drill down into it. The key point here, I think, was summarized well by Nick in the aforementioned post, where he explains the difference between “network effects” (which we all know from phone, fax, email, Skype, etc.) and “network ownership effects,” which is what tokens unleash. You not only get utility from more people joining the network but since participation in the network requires ownership and use of network-specific tokens, you actually gain an increase in the value of the tokens you hold. Let’s take La’Zooz as a very early example. It’s an effort to become a decentralized Uber. In the Uber model, you join the network and as more users/drivers join, the utility of the network goes up. As the utility of the network increases, the value of Uber increases, because they are effectively the protocol (rule maker), connecting buyers and sellers. The value appreciation goes to the owners of the “protocol,” in this case, Uber. (Facebook, eBay, Etsy, Craigslist, Twitter, and most others in the so-called “sharing economy” fall into this category.) In the decentralized token economy world, La’Zooz creates a token (which they have, it’s called a Zooz) and offers it for ownership to members of the network. Leaving the marketing question aside (though that’s my favorite topic and, admittedly, critical), here’s what happens: Riders need Zoozs in order to pay for rides. Drivers accept Zoozs in return for rides. As there is a finite number of Zoozs — or a predictable inflation to the currency based on the protocol rules — (though they are digital so they can be cost-effectively sliced into multiple decimals), the value of each Zooz increases as the demand for them increases. Let’s think of it this way and keep it very simple: There are 100 Zoozs out there. Each one is worth $1. There are 100 network participants. 50 drivers and 50 riders. Each ride costs 1 Zooz. As word gets around that La’Zooz is cheaper than Uber, more people want Zoozs. So they trade their dollars or Bitcoins for Zoozs, which increases the price of a Zooz to $2. So now everyone who has a Zooz has $2 worth of value instead of $1. The purchasing power has doubled, so you can afford 2 rides for 1 Zooz instead of 1. So you sell half a Zooz to someone who needs one and keep the other one for buying rides. The drivers who were charging 1 Zooz now see the value of the ride they gave in the past go from $1 to $2 (retroactively) and are more inclined to accept Zoozs because they expect more people to join the network. In effect, by taking these tokens, you are getting value today AND getting value in the future. Instead of Uber capturing the value that accrues, the owners of the network (the token holders) capture the value. Whoa! This is what will happen in all kinds of networks: identity networks, reputation networks, social networks (why should Facebook get all the value that you create by posting? You should), and many more. This is precisely what has happened with Bitcoin over the past nine years. It’s why Olaf was so damn smart to get paid in Bitcoin only when the price was mega, mega low. He understood this very early on. And it’s why he has started a fund to find the next of these. You can also research and invest in these (though it’s definitely caveat emptor time). Some networks will issue tokens and see the value creation there. And, if you’re wondering, “What’s the incentive for the protocol creators?” that’s a good question. The answer is that the protocol creators will hold a portion of the tokens for themselves and get to profit from the future value creation. The number of tokens the protocol creators receive will be transparently available for inspection by anyone via a blockchain. That way, you or anyone can decide if it’s too much (they are being greedy) or if it’s not enough (they won’t stick around). Others blockchain-based businesses will develop the protocol and not issue tokens. Instead, they will attempt to monetize via the app layer. Distributed apps (dApps). When you have a shared data layer and a shared protocol, the management of information becomes liberated. It is freed from silos and you have much more flexibility. Let’s take a simple example: photos. Right now, you take a picture on your iPhone or Android device and you save it to the cloud. Except the “cloud” in this case is proprietary. Your iPhone picture sits in iCloud, and if you want to use the photos in any type of application, you need to use iPhoto. But what if you really love the way Google does the “auto-animation” or if you want Adobe Photohop to interface with the same photo? Well, you have to download the picture and then upload it to a different proprietary cloud. Now, you have two copies of the picture in two different clouds, both of which are technically owned by you (but now actually owned by Apple and Google) and management, tracking, and rights management (in some cases) becomes even more complicated. Built on a photo asset tracking protocol, the world of distributed apps works differently. The data layer is shared among all apps that use the protocol, so any photo editing/tweaking app can interface with the same original photo. Obviously, you’ll be able to create a copy or version of it based on how you tweak it, but you don’t have to move it around from one proprietary cloud to another. In this model, you might pay a video editing dApp creator a small token for use of their software (connected back to the protocol we just discussed above) and then a slide show dApp creator another token for use of their software. All of this will be run in your browser and the coins will be managed behind the scenes on your behalf. (Brave is starting this trend with micro-payments to publishers in Bitcoin in return for no ads, but there will be more to come.) As an end consumer, you’ll get faster, cheaper, and definitely more secure application experiences as well as the knowledge that only you have access to your data. The dApp creator will get value from the payments in creating the most valuable application for interfacing with the protocols below it. So, if the dApp QuickTime version is the best, everyone can use it, regardless of the OS. The challenge here, and why Tom labeled it “volatile” is that switching costs are basically zero. If I don’t like an app, I can pretty easily move to another one, use the same tokens that I already have, and just start paying the new dApp creator instead. For example, the other day, I moved one of my Bitcoin addresses (the interface to the Bitcoin blockchain) from one wallet provider to another (just to see if I could do it), and I did it in 40 seconds. Imagine moving your bank account from Citi to CapitalOne in 40 seconds. That’s what we’re talking about and why the UX of these dApps will be the killer differentiator. So, there’s revenue opportunity and value creation at this layer as well. The person(s) who build the great user experiences will be freed from platforms to focus on utility for the end user. There’s A LOT here and much to still to be discovered and explored. It’s a HUGE opportunity to rethink entire industries and functions and how value will be created and distributed.

Newswise — SAN FRANCISCO, April 2, 2017 — Pollution created by making and dyeing clothes has pitted the fashion industry and environmentalists against each other. Now, the advent of “fast fashion” — trendy clothing affordable enough to be disposable — has strained that relationship even more. But what if we could recycle clothes like we recycle paper, or even upcycle them? Scientists report today new progress toward that goal. The team will present the work at the 253rd National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS). ACS, the world’s largest scientific society, is holding the meeting here through Thursday. It features more than 14,000 presentations on a wide range of science topics. “People don’t want to spend much money on textiles anymore, but poor-quality garments don’t last,” Simone Haslinger explains. “A small amount might be recycled as cleaning rags, but the rest ends up in landfills, where it degrades and releases carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas. Also, there isn’t much arable land anymore for cotton fields, as we also have to produce food for a growing population.” All these reasons amount to a big incentive to recycle clothing, and some efforts are already underway, such as take-back programs. But even industry representatives admit in news reports that only a small percentage gets recycled. Other initiatives shred used clothing and incorporate the fibers into carpets or other products. But Haslinger, a doctoral candidate at Aalto University in Finland, notes that this approach isn’t ideal since the carpets will ultimately end up in landfills, too. A better strategy, says Herbert Sixta, Ph.D., who heads the biorefineries research group at Aalto University, is to upcycle worn-out garments: “We want to not only recycle garments, but we want to really produce the best possible textiles, so that recycled fibers are even better than native fibers.” But achieving this goal isn’t simple. Cotton and other fibers are often blended with polyester in fabrics such as “cotton-polyester blends,” which complicates processing. Previous research showed that many ionic liquids can dissolve cellulose. But the resulting material couldn’t then be re-used to make new fibers. Then about five years ago, Sixta’s team found an ionic liquid — 1,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene acetate — that could dissolve cellulose from wood pulp, producing a material that could be spun into fibers. Later testing showed that these fibers are stronger than commercially available viscose and feel similar to lyocell. Lyocell is also known by the brand name Tencel, which is a fiber favored by eco-conscious designers because it’s made of wood pulp. Building on this process, the researchers wanted to see if they could apply the same ionic liquid to cotton-polyester blends. In this case, the different properties of polyester and cellulose worked in their favor, Haslinger says. They were able to dissolve the cotton into a cellulose solution without affecting the polyester. “I could filter the polyester out after the cotton had dissolved,” Haslinger says. “Then it was possible without any more processing steps to spin fibers out of the cellulose solution, which could then be used to make clothes.” To move their method closer to commercialization, Sixta’s team is testing whether the recovered polyester can also be spun back into usable fibers. In addition, the researchers are working to scale up the whole process and are investigating how to reuse dyes from discarded clothing. But, Sixta notes, after a certain point, commercializing the process doesn’t just require chemical know-how. “We can handle the science, but we might not know what dye was used, for example, because it’s not labeled,” he says. “You can’t just feed all the material into the same process. Industry and policymakers have to work on the logistics. With all the rubbish piling up, it is in everyone’s best interest to find a solution.” The researchers received funding support from the European Union’s Trash-2-Cash project and the Finnish government. The American Chemical Society is a nonprofit organization chartered by the U.S. Congress. With nearly 157,000 members, ACS is the world’s largest scientific society and a global leader in providing access to chemistry-related research through its multiple databases, peer-reviewed journals and scientific conferences.

The spread of urban areas and consequences of global warming simultaneously decrease the area of arable land.1 Cotton industry will consequently compete for acreage with food and biofuels.2 The creation of a circular economy therefore seems indispensable. Currently, the lack of adequate recycling strategies prevents the usage of worn out textiles as a source of raw material for new value added products.3 Textiles on the market represent almost exclusively multi-component garments with cotton polyester blends being the most prominent mixture, which poses severe challenges onto their recycling due to their inherent heterogeneity.4 Recently developed recycling strategies propose the dissolution of the cellulosic component in N-methylmorpholine N-oxide5,6 or imidazolium derived ionic liquids.7,8 Although these approaches suggest subsequent fiber spinning, they fail to demonstrate the feasibility of the concept. The process presented herein aims to overcome these weaknesses in state-of-the-art methodologies. A superbase-derived ionic liquid dissolves the cotton component selectively without any significant degradation of the residual polyester. After filtration, the cellulose solution is subjected to dry-jet wet spinning to obtain Lyocell-type fibers, while the recovered polyester can be fed back to conventional industrial processes such as melt spinning. The ionic liquid is regained by thin film evaporation. 1 Hämmerle, F. M. Lenzinger Berichte 2011, 89, 12-21. 2 The Fiber Year 2015. 3 Briga-sà, A.; D. Nascimento; N. Teixeira; J. Pinto; F.

The impact of these multi-threading improvements to VP9 are very exciting. Straight from the mailing list message discussing the work, "encoding HD videos with 4 column tiles, the improved VP9 MT encoder achieved speedups over the original of 11% with 2 threads, 27% with 4 threads, 101% with 8 threads, and 135% with 16 threads." This is due to libvpx's VP9 encoder switching to using a block row based threading approach. This has allowed over a 100% speed improvement for 720p/1080p videos with using more than four threads, faster encoding for small resolution videos, and greater than 10% speed improvement when there is no change in the number of encoding threads. Check out that mailing list post for more details.

LG G6 review: A breath of fresh air David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/03/28 9:35am PDTMar 28, 2017 31 Plus 1 on G+ 89 Share on Facebook 73 Share on Twitter Total Shares193 G6 News Phone Reviews Article Contents 1 The Good 2 The Not So Good 3 Design and materials 4 Display 5 Battery life 6 Storage, wireless, and reception 7 Audio and speakers 8 Camera 9 Performance and stability 10 Software 11 Value 12 Conclusion If the G5 was the low watermark for LG's mobile division, you might think there was only really up to go for LG in 2017. The G6 can feel like a self-fulfilling prophecy that way: the narrative around the G5 was almost universally negative, and the idea that 2017 would yield a "comeback" product from LG seemed to become a given. After all, it was obvious what LG did wrong last year, so how could they not address these issues? At the same time, we often find ourselves saying tech companies make a habit of poor product decisions year after year, so it's never quite a sure thing that a new gadget really will check the very-obvious-to-us boxes we've communally decided are so important. With that in mind, LG does seem to have had its ear to the ground with the G6, iterating and changing things that clearly irked or concerned would-be customers. Waterproofing, a more premium look and feel, upgraded cameras, more efficient use of space (bezels), good battery life - these are things that, to smartphone enthusiasts, sound so terribly obvious as ways to up your product's appeal. They're the areas where LG has focused, I would argue, and the result is a phone that fundamentally is much more palatable than the awkward G5, even if the G6 isn't what I'd call perfect. (In fact, the G6 can be fairly flawed at times.) But if you were hoping that LG would show up with a competent, modern smartphone in 2017, I think the G6 will do the trick. It's not the kind of phone that immediately strikes you as to why it works, but it does. The Good Display I'm loving the wider (longer?) screen, and LG's IPS LCD looks as good as ever. This works for me. Battery Good battery life, if not exceptional. If you're in the US, you get the bonus of wireless charging. Ruggedization LG claims the G6 stands up to a drop pretty well, and it's also IP68 certified for dust and water resistance. Compact The G6 has a screen equivalent in surface area to a normal 5.5" phone, but it's very noticeably smaller than one. Camera I think most people will really like the G6's cameras. I wasn't the biggest fan, but there's no denying they produce very social media-friendly results. There are also two of them on the back. Premium This feels like the "premium" LG phone we've been asking for. It's nice. It looks good in black (but kind of bad in the two other colors, if I'm honest). The Not So Good Battery While the battery life is solid now, it's not amazing, and I think a screen of this size warrants a bit more battery just as a future-proofing measure. 3500 or 3600mAh would have seemed more appropriate. Storage 64GB should be standard on a $650+ phone in 2017. If OnePlus does it for $200 less than that, LG can do it. Camera I don't like LG's image processing, it destroys image detail and the photos look bad on large monitors, even if they look great on the phone's screen. Software aesthetic LG doesn't make Android any harder or more annoying to use, but this is The Ugly Duckling of smartphone themes. Android 7.0 We should be launching with 7.1, please. Design and materials If you're considering the G6, let me save you some time right now on which color to choose: black. Don't like black? Still get the black one. Really want a white phone? Get the black one. Think the silver looks flashy? Buy black. Only the black G6 really does proper justice to the small bezels around the screen, because it's the only one with black bezels. They just kind of visually wash away when you're holding the phone. The dark gray aluminum frame blends in nicely, and while the glossy black finish on the back is fingerprint-prone, you can always use a case or skin to fix that. It has this sort of "stealth phone" look (thanks for that, Ryan) that really works for me. I also think it does a good job hiding the G6's rather ugly "surprised robot" face on the back of the phone. It's not as bad as it was on the G5 and V20, but, yeah. It's there, and the black version of the phone makes it the least apparent. Buy the black one. The silver and white versions of the G6 kind of ruin all the magic of that tiny bezel. The phone's material composition is glass sandwich, with a gently curved glass pane on the back, an anodized aluminum mid-frame, and a flat front glass panel. LG has tried to spin the flat screen as an ergonomic and durability choice, saying curved screens are harder to use (they are) and they're more fragile (they can be). LG even went as far as to say their phone is much less likely to crack from a drop impact than a device with a curved screen, claiming the design allows force to be distributed more evenly in the event of an impact. I'm not sure how much better it really is in that sense than any other flat phone, but hey, maybe there's something to it. Overall, I like the feel of the G6. With the compact size coupled with the fairly large display, the G6 feels right at home in your hand and your pocket without seeming cramped to actually use. I find it very hard to go back to "normal" 5-inch smartphones anymore, and while the G6's 5.7" screen isn't actually as large as a 16:9 panel with the same diagonal, the added vertical space definitely helps for reading, typing, and web browsing. It's absolutely enough. Compared to the 5.5" Google Pixel XL, the G6 is much more one-handed use friendly - though it is a fair bit more slippery. Despite having screens of near identical surface area, the G6 is much more compact than the Pixel XL. This is a phone that has a premium quality to it, and I think that's a story best told by the minimal bezel on the front - it has a slightly futuristic vibe that gives the G6 a little something beyond your average glass and metal smartphone visually. Again, I maintain this is only true with the black version: I find this phone kind of ghastly in silver. But it feels very well put together and, in that sense, is a complete departure from the disjointed and strange G5. Waterproofing with an IP68 rating means the G6 doesn't just look the part, it can go for a swim and be no worse for wear. So not only does it look and feel better, it actually is better, too. I do have some ergonomic complaints. The volume keys sit too high on the body of the phone (which makes camera quick launches harder), and I'd prefer a traditional power key. I like to check my notifications without unlocking the screen. You could make the fingerprint reader key a custom button. Just a suggestion. Display LG's IPS panels have been a mixed bag over the years, but what I hear from fans of the brand is that they're generally well-liked despite some technical shortcomings. The G6's screen gets very bright, though in direct sunlight it really fares no better than a modern Super AMOLED panel. The intensely stark whites of LG's screens have their critics, me included, but some people prefer the more blue-ish whites because they give things a "cleaner," higher-contrast look. Colors are predictably oversaturated, but not annoyingly so, though there is no option to change the profile or white temperature. You can activate the "comfort view" on the lowest setting to get a more natural, albeit slightly yellow, white point. Confusingly, LG's blue light filter (comfort view) doesn't have an option to set automatic on and off times. Really? The screen has excellent viewing angles and neither of my test units has any appreciable light bleed around the edges (a problem last year on the G5). As to the 18:9 aspect ratio, I don't find it's really impacted the appearance or usability of any apps on the phone. Some very old apps may have an issue with the effective software aspect ratio (16.7:9 - excluding the nav keys), but LG allows you to set them to compatibility mode (16:9) or even extend them to full-screen (18:9) if you want. So that's nice - good thinking, LG. The screen is a clear focus on the G6, and it works. I like the extra vertical real estate and could definitely see myself buying a phone with a wider aspect ratio display in the future. There's benefit here, ergonomically and visually, and LG has made the case for me. Battery life The G6's 3300mAh battery may not sound like much when you're thinking about a 5.7" device, but you have to remember that the surface area of this panel is actually just a little bit greater than a 5.5" screen with a standard 16:9 aspect ratio like the one on the Pixel XL. So, the battery isn't large given the display's size, but it's not comically small, either. I found the G6's battery life to be above average, but not amazing. LG's automatic brightness is very, very conservative, and that probably helped things a bit. I reliably and consistently hit over four hours of screen-on time during normal usage, sometimes closing in on five. So, not as good as the Pixel XL, but within shouting distance. It's acceptable, just not remarkable. Quick Charge 3.0 is on board (LG is including a quick charger in the box), as is wireless charging (only in North America the USA), if that's something you want. I can understand leveling some criticism at LG for not fitting a larger cell here, though. A 10% boost in capacity would probably push the G6 into the 'very good' battery life column, as opposed to the 'just good' one. It's not what I'd call a deal breaker. The phone lasted long enough for me and I never felt like I was getting shortchanged on the longevity front, as opposed to the rather frustrating experience I had with the HTC U Ultra. Storage, wireless, and reception Storage is one place where the G6 falls short for me. Not only does it start at 32GB, that's your only option. There are no 64GB models being made available here in the US, and with rumors saying Samsung's Galaxy S8 will come with 64GB standard, that stings. I really would like to see all major smartphone vendors move to make 64GB the baseline for storage on a flagship phone. OnePlus can offer it at $440 - LG can't at over $200 more? My Verizon unit came with just over 19GB of room available out of the box. That's not much. There is a microSD slot, so you're not totally without options here. Still, it's one of those flaws I spoke of earlier: LG could have done better. Wireless performance has been fine for me on both the unlocked preproduction version of the phone I tested as well as the retail Verizon unit I received more recently for testing. Bluetooth reception has been just OK - it's not as bad as it is on the Pixel XL in my car, which will cut out even just sitting in the passenger seat at times - but it's not fantastic, either. For example, I can't keep a steady Bluetooth audio stream if the G6 is in my pocket (to be fair, my leg is resting against the transmission tunnel). Call quality has been fine and I have no signal issues to report at this time. Audio and speakers Most G6s sold across the globe will not feature LG's "Hi-Fi" Quad DAC and amplifier, but the standard Aqstic part from Qualcomm, which is fine. While not as powerful as the third-party solution LG will be using in some Asian countries, this really only matters if you're trying to drive very big or very high-impedance headphones, and shouldn't impact most people. I maintain that the audio from Qualcomm's DAC and amplifier combination hub is perfectly good, though I wouldn't mind a little more output for those times when I would like to wear my big over-ears. Quality-wise, though, it's still excellent. The G6's bottom-firing speaker is reasonably loud but pretty tinny, not quite as balanced as the speaker on my Pixel XL. It is noticeably more powerful - and loudness tends to be king on phone speakers. I still don't love the direction it's facing, as I don't on any phone with this configuration, but it's passable and by no means bad. Oh, and the G6 has a headphone jack, because LG doesn't hate you. Camera I have a feeling my sentiments about the G6's cameras will not echo many other reviewers. I don't like the G6's rear-facing cameras very much. Don't get me wrong, they can produce some very striking images with incredible contrast... but it's not real. LG's processing is so aggressive that when you zoom into full crop it's like somebody oil-painted your photo. This makes framing adjustments a real bear: you can't crop too close, otherwise the oil-painting effect becomes obvious, especially in low light. The photos also just don't look good on big screens a lot of the time because the processing becomes so much more apparent on a 27" monitor. Some people, though, love the cameras on this phone. They produce images that are instantly ready for social media, because they almost look a little filtered right out of the gallery. And when you're looking on a 5-6" smartphone screen, you're not going to notice the processing nearly as much. Take this shot of the beach taken with the wide angle camera. Looks solid, right? Take a peek at a slightly less forgiving crop. The rocks actually look like they were painted onto the picture. Come on. The HDR algorithm also halos like crazy around buildings, making photos look like they were run through the Snapseed gauntlet. It's just not to my taste. The G6's cameras, then, really depend on what your priorities are. For me? I'm still taking the Pixel every single day of the week over the G6 for the camera. Not even close in my book. The other party trick is obviously the wide-angle lens that allows you to capture a scene from a much different perspective than the standard camera. LG talks about its "zoom" feature but really that's kind of a load of crap - you're just digital zooming on the wide angle sensor until it effectively hits the point at which the narrow-angle lens sees from. LG says it's smoother and more natural than it was on the G5 and V20, and I guess it kind of is, but not enough that I'm really impressed by it at all. I just switch between the two cameras with the toggle - the zooming is nice for grandma, but not for anyone who knows to avoid digital zoom like the plague. Launch speed of the camera from sleep is good, about on par with the Pixel, in my experience - just double-tap the volume key and you're off. I do wish switching between the sensors was faster, though. The issue is that the phone remembers whichever one you were last using, and launches with that one selected. That's fine, but if I want to switch to the normal, narrow-angle lens camera, I'm wasting an extra few seconds to find the button, hit it, and then wait for the switch to happen. It's definitely a usability issue, and I know it's not one with an easy solution, but there it is. Previous Next Performance and stability While I would hesitate to say the G6 is Google Pixel levels of smooth or consistent, it's still a very quick phone. It doesn't have the almost manic rapidness of the OnePlus 3T, and the animations hang consistently more often than on the Pixel, but it's fast. I can definitely tell I'm not using a Samsung phone, I'll say that much. So, let's talk about that Snapdragon 821. It's not an 835. The Galaxy S8 will almost certainly have a Snapdragon 835. The G6 does not. This will upset people on the internet who tend to become upset about such things. If you are liable to be upset about this, by all means, rant. But it's not like LG had much choice in the matter unless they wanted to delay the G6's launch by several months, and it's not like the Snapdragon 821 is at all a bad chipset. We quite like it in the Google Pixel and OnePlus 3T. And let's not forget: the Pixel XL, which I still heartily recommend to almost everyone, is substantially pricier than the G6. If you have to have the newest processor, you're not going to buy this phone anyway, so it's kind of a moot point. If you don't care about that, I don't think the Snapdragon 821 in any way makes the G6 a worse product. Bug-wise, I haven't encountered any major issues, or really any minor ones that come to mind, either. The phone feels stable and I've not had any strange problems. Software I still take issue with some of LG's aesthetic modifications. Their UI is inconsistent visually, though they did finally drop that awful sea green teal color. But, that aside, they really don't mess with Android in many ways I'd call annoying. You have your standard quick settings titles, Nougat's bundled notifications, a comprehensible settings menu, and not too many unnecessary bloat apps (from LG, at least) or legacy features (Samsung) crowding things up. Once you throw on a custom launcher and ditch LG's not-good keyboard, you won't find that LG's changes to the software are going to come up too often. And that's a good thing. While not as light a hand as you'd find with something like Motorola's UI these days, LG's additions can be genuinely useful, allowing you to customize the theme, navigation bar, the aforementioned aspect ratio scaling for apps, and double-tap to wake the screen. There aren't nearly as many features as you'd find on a Samsung phone, but that's not necessarily bad - LG keeps the clutter relatively low. There really isn't that much to say about the software, if I'm honest, and I mean that in a positive sense. It feels like Android 7.0, albeit with some aesthetic and a few functional modifications here and there. Sure, you'll want to replace the launcher and the keyboard, but that's true of almost any smartphone not made by Google or Motorola these days, and it's hardly what I'd call a "problem."    LG has gone out of its way to talk up a few apps that it has "enhanced" for the new aspect ratio, but I can't recall a single time I ever noticed one - aside from the photo roll in the camera app. But there really haven't been any major changes made for the screen's new shape, that was definitely more marketing than substance. I mean, unless you count the rounded corners. Those are a thing. The one real complaint I do have about the software is the Android version: 7.0, at least on my US Verizon unit. LG told me, though there may have been some confusion around this, that the phone would launch with Android 7.1 by the time it went to retail. My retail unit is decidedly not running Android 7.1. I've asked LG about this and will update if I get a response. To be fair, LG is generally much quicker than Samsung about OS updates, so maybe we'll see a 7.1 update soon. Value The G6 will cost anywhere from around $650 to a little over $700 here in the US depending on your carrier or retailer, pretty much in line with the G5 last year. If you're going to pull the OnePlus 3T out, as I know some of you are dying to, obviously the G6 doesn't come out of a value analysis as the best smartphone bang for your buck. But that's true of essentially every $600+ smartphone, including Google's Pixels. Most people in the US buy their phones using installment plans now, and by that metric, the G6 costs a Very Average High-End Smartphone Amount of Money. Is it worth it? I think you'll need to consider your priorities. First, compared to what I'd call the benchmark high-end Android phone right now (Pixel XL), the G6 obviously has a few advantages. It's more ergonomic, it's actually waterproof, it costs less money, and it's going to be much more readily available (an area where Google is seriously dropping the ball). Dual cameras may be an advantage, if you really care, and while it's US-specific, wireless charging is something to consider. If you're looking a bit further out to smartphones yet-to-be-announced, that's a harder question. We don't know how much the Galaxy S8 will cost or exactly when it will launch, and we also don't know for sure just what all the changes are yet. I will admit, it's hard for me to see LG coming out of such a comparison on top, but I guess it could happen. Conclusion You may be thinking "That's it? That's the whole review?" (OK, maybe you aren't, but this one felt short to me when I was writing it.) But I think it's a good sort of 'that's it.' The G6 isn't the most exciting phone we're going to see in 2017, but it's a reassuringly competent improvement on the smartphone formula, at least for most people. You get more screen in a smaller package, two cameras on the back instead of one, respectable battery life, and software that doesn't make you want to tear your hair out. I remember when we would have been excited to have just one of these things (sorry, I don't mean to dig the "in my day" trope up), and even in 2017, I think we'll still see a handful of phones that don't get all of this right. Where could the G6 improve? I would have liked a larger battery, as we all know decent battery life today does not necessarily mean decent battery life one major Android platform update down the road. And batteries age. I still don't like LG's camera processing techniques, but realize I may be in the minority here. The software is not visually appealing, even if it doesn't do much to functionally impede the user experience. I'm also not a fan of the power button being the fingerprint reader; I'd prefer a separate power key on the side so I can check my notifications without unlocking the phone and thus having to hit the power key again to put it back to sleep. 64GB of storage should have been standard. And my last gripe is really to America's carriers, not LG: Stop changing the software just to change it (Verizon, I'm glaring at you in particular). Overall, though, there are few fundamental changes I would make to the G6. I think the constituent pieces are there: this is a good smartphone. I'm also naming it one of our editor's choice "Most Wanted" smartphones - LG did a lot right with the G6, and it's refreshing to see them build the kind of product I think we all knew they could.

Please put a case on your new expensive phone. southerndinner Lol you got the ugly color steadymobb The platinum is nice, black is boring. Good choice. His opinion doesn't make it the right one! HSidhu First comment Maximiliano Barra E. I have a little question: normally, LG adjusts the DPI of its software to ridiculously high values ​​(640 in G3, for example). Can this be changed in the G6? David Ruddock Yep. And you can change it. I agree, it's annoying. I really, really need my 5 icons across on Google Now Launcher. EcE I haven't finished reading but regarding the checking your notifications part. You can't double tap the screen to turn it on anymore? sproc Yes but only since it is running version 7. But you can change any phone or tablet's DPI using adb. But with my LG phone it crashes the phone app if you go to contacts so kinda useless unless you have 7. Corey W. What do you mean by "version 7"? Do you mean Nougat? Also what is abd? Imparus Yes version 7 is Nougat, and adb is https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html sproc That phone is going :O in the one picture Valnac That's funny! i can't not see the face now! Corey W. I'll keep the G6 in mind...while I'm online preordering the S8 tomorrow BC Yeah, I feel like the LG G6 is pretty but lacks everything that would make me want it. If only the 64GB and Quad Dac made it into the LG G6, in addition to the wireless charging for the US Model. So Samsung, wins again through sheer incompetence on LG's part. As LG still hasn't learned their lesson. When the specs are released officially, I'll likely get the S8 or hold out for a Note-like device. Ghani Alta Pradita What an adorable phone! Almost decided to get one, but since my biggest concern was battery backup, then I decided to get redmi 4 prime (yes, a budget phone).

I'll buy a paperweight from the dollar store and pocket the difference. Matthew Bowe I hear this all the time, but I've had every LG G phone in succession and never experienced any boot-looping. Other problems, absolutely, but never boot-looping. Joshua Hill It's not the percentage of occurrence but the fact that this problem has persisted for many generations and LG up to atleast the g5/v10 have yet to rectify the problem. They're warranty support has been terrible for people affected. I'd have to seriously consider paying for anything from a manufacturer with such a poor record. Probably safer to put you money on the roulette table ;) CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT!!!! Consumers don't normally do this if everything is fine. EcE Consider yourself lucky. I had them on a G3 and G. It took me about 8 months of fighting customer service to get a working phone I could sell online for cheap. I would never ever buy an LG phone again.

David T Could you also ask when they'll push the security updates to the H850 Eur/UK? Presently on Nov2016 and they made a commitment to give out monthly updates or so I was led to believe. ike3232 whatever you do, do not buy an unlocked version. lg does not send android updates to those models. i learned the hard way. my unlocked unbranded rs988 g5 is stuck on marshmallow. Patruns Source of info please? ike3232 lol as an owner of this particular phone model rs988, i am the source of information MattPortland Oh so okay. Umm Patruns That just means yours did not work. derk p too bad LG lost me as a customer after a bootlooping nexus 5x and then hearing about all their previous devices with very high failure rates. Roy Yeah, same story with an LG G5 for me. I loved the phone until it bootlooped. Then, I grudgingly switch to an S6 (ok phone but I had been trying to get away from Samsung) when Verizon happened to not have replacement G5's on hand and offered the S6 in it's place. kamiller42 "(a problem last year on the G6)" Uh, what? LG, do not screw up the V30. Keep the quad DAC worldwide. It makes a difference, especially in high impedance mode. For those who don't have it, it's not hard to get the V20 into high impedance mode. You don't need high dollar cans to do it. Aural pleasure. supersanborn I hated the harsh post-processing in my G4. Surprised they haven't figured this out. Ztax I hated it in my G2... Matthew Bowe You can shoot in RAW if it's an issue. I like the post-processing. Kevin Davis A beautiful phone that is geographically crippled. Good luck, Lg. Drakenoid You can double tap the screen to wake it as a workaround to your fingerprint power button issue. Stocklone It should also have double tap status bar to lock like the G5. So no power button needed at all. Drakenoid Also @David Ruddock:disqus there's a typo in there: "(a problem last year on the G6)". I am guessing it should be G5. David Ruddock It has since been fixed. rjyanj That side by side with the Pixel really highlights how stupid the Pixel design is.

No deal I'll stick with my G5 until the end of time it seems Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ * Wireless charging, good * MST and LG Pay?

But it also looks very dim. Maybe that's how they save battery. IMO the jury is out as to whether the dimness makes the AOD useful or useless. james It is the main display there is no secondary, and even with it dim it's still very easy to see drksilenc Black doesnt take any power to display only light does so just the notification takes power. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You're thinking of OLED. This display is LCD, which has a backlight that lights up the whole display, even the black part. Christopher Bailey (Xcom923) LG pay? this is the first I'm hearing about it. I have the phone and no such app. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ That's why I said "if so". The rumors were that it would have an MST payment ability like Samsung phones. MattPortland Samsung owns the MST tech. Jason Why aren't we seeing more phones with dual front-facing speakers like the Nexus 6P? I thought that was the way forward, but then it seems like the phones since then aren't getting them. Eclectech HTC got so much grief for the bezels that came with their speakers that they've basically stopped trying to be different. Robert Minneman No removable battery? Stupid move LG especially after the crappy manufacturing defect of the G4. Just jump on board with all the other dumbass companies going waterproof due stupid owners. Patruns Why is this an issue? Do you usually carry around fully charged spare batteries for your phone? Impulse_Vigil Some people do, I did when I had various HTC EVOs but seldom used them... Powering down and taking the case off was just too much of a hassle, it'd be somewhat better with the way Android saves your recently used stuff today but still... The other side to that argument is that batteries age, quickly when you're eating 1+ charge cycles every day... Being able to easily swap it means it'll remain useful for a good 3 years, whereas you might otherwise start feeling battery anxiety much earlier. I swapped the battery on my Nexus 5 to hold me over until the Pixel, but newer phones are tougher to get into. Just playing devil's advocate mind you. I'd like to see Google or whomever implement a battery replacement program. Joshua Hill When I had a galaxy S2 I did exactly that. I had the official slightly larger Samsung battery that made the back of the phone flush and carried around the original smaller battery in case of emergencies. I'm not sure why you asked the question??? I can think of only two reasons for a removable battery: 1) to replace the battery if it dies during use so you can continue to use your phone 2) to replace the battery after a year or two or whenever it stops holding a useful amount of charge. Adam Margeson Seriously. Back when I was using my Dell Axim X30, I would keep a spare battery with me, but the thing only lasted a short time and it was back when compatible chargers (out and about) weren't as plentiful. These days, if a phone can last 12 hours off the charger with ~3-4 Hr SOT, I'm fine. I have no qualms putting my phone on the charger when I get home for a little bit if I absolutely need to. If you're a travelling salesman or such, I can see spare batteries being something of a necessity, but even then, there are lots of USB based solutions out there. I'm sure ZeroLemon will probably make a battery case, too. Vivek Rameses I always wanted to try LG. This looks nice. Patruns Been happy with my LG Nexus 5 for over 3 years now. 1st phone I have seen that I would consider upgrading to. A lack of wireless charging phones as been the biggest issue holding me back. May not be a concern for many, but a deal breaker for me and the bride. I will look at the next Samsung, but their handling of the exploding washing machines has left a bad taste in my mouth and I am reluctant to buy another Samsung product. Phone_Addiction Only the usa model has wireless charging, the canadian model doesn;t. so, it's not all of North america that will have wireless charging. David Ruddock Interesting. I thought I heard otherwise. Benjamin Lehto So the Canadian model is missing Wireless charging and the Quad Dac? Phone_Addiction Yeah, sad really it's the same as what Europe is getting. Only certain Asian countries are getting quad DAC and only USA for wireless charging. It's really dumbass shit lg could pull. Benjamin Lehto Sigh, release a phone with all the same innards to every country. Sell one damn phone LG. Marty That's what I wish Sony would do with Xperia. Only the US is without an enabled fingerprint scanner. Phone_Addiction I mean if apple can do this and even a small company like oneplus can do it. Then it makes no sense why LG can't do this. Either all models have the features or none of them have it. Christopher Bailey (Xcom923) can someone tell me why the want for Android 7.1? I don't see anything specific for it that's not just Pixel related stuff, emoji? launcher adjustments? why do we need 7.1 if we can't utilize 7.1? 7.0 seems just fine till the O release. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Android Nougat 7.1 Night Light Touch/display performance improvements Moves (Fingerprint swipe down gesture - opt-in) Seamless A/B system updates Daydream VR mode Developer features: App shortcuts / shortcut manager APIs Circular app icons support Keyboard image insertion Fingerprint sensor gesture to open/close notification shade Manual storage manager Intent for apps Improved VR thread scheduling Enhanced wallpaper metadata Multi-endpoint call support Support for various MNO requirements PCDMA voice privacy property Source type support for Visual Voicemail Carrier config options for managing video telephony Manual storage manager - identifies apps and files and apps using storage Christopher Bailey (Xcom923) Night Light - are you talking about that night mode thing that each other manufacture of Android has put into their phones (blue light tint?) If so that's another one of those things that's been out for a while. Touch/display performance improvements - ....ok Moves (Fingerprint swipe down gesture - opt-in) - ok, I guess that's legit Seamless A/B system updates - I forgot about this one Daydream VR mode - This is hardware based, so there is no point in factoring that in (size and screen have to be compatible) App shortcuts / shortcut manager APIs - Nova, and I'm sure other launchers do this Circular app icons support - Masks have been doing this for a while on 3rd party launchers Keyboard image insertion - this is a feature? Keyboards have been doing this for a while, the one that comes to mind is Bitmoji. I know that it's a system function but the end user won't know a difference Fingerprint sensor gesture to open/close notification shade - mentioned above Manual storage manager Intent for apps - I am not sure what this does and it's to early for me to do more research Improved VR thread scheduling - again VR is a hardware thing, no point if you don't' support VR Enhanced wallpaper metadata - Dev function the end user won't notice Multi-endpoint call support - another thing I'm not going to look up atm Support for various MNO requirements - stuff like this is usually built into the skin on top of android PCDMA voice privacy property - Not gonna look up Source type support for Visual Voicemail - I guess that's cool Carrier config options for managing video telephony - another Android feature manufactures have been doing for a while that's being baked in Manual storage manager - identifies apps and files and apps using storage....wait that was mentioned above, I guess I dont' have to look it up afterall. Anyway Most Man. have a substitute for this that they've been using for years. All in all there are just a handful of things a OEM would even care about since most of the feature list are just things that they either already did themselves (think Samsung and LG) or stuff that they can't use/have their own version of (think VR, fingerprint stuff). Ultimately keeping 7.0 makes a lot of sense in most cases and just waiting for the O release. Keep in mind monthly security updates are still a thing, so regardless most big man. have to keep chipping at 7.0 for a while anyway rockstarr27 Uneven bezel size make it unattractive. The S8 will be here soon so oh well. Marty I was hyped for the S8 till I learned it won't have an in-display fingerprint scanner. Gonna add an iPhone to my collection as soon as the 8 is released. John Smith You're always shilling Marty. You were never going to praise the S8, so stop claiming you were 'hyped' for it, that's just dishonest as hell. You're a well known Samsung hater. Nice dream about the iPhone 8, which will be a copy of the S8, but still fall short. Marty Yeah, sure. Whatever you say... 😉 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/228e7dd67124eb4a74a54d58fc44e8c497b6e30c6ebfff014d367f7587286344.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8d9678ba9ab4c38bf39e023533d865354656215fbcd767ff65e1c247df88ec7b.jpg Joshua Hill Have you nothing better to do than attack people in online comments? You seem like a disgraceful sort of human being, this is not how we treat one another. MattPortland Are you new? People treat each other like shit all over the internet. Joshua Hill No I'm not new. I generally don't bother commenting because I'm well aware of what the comments sections on the internet are like lol I guess I must be feeling unusually sociable today ;) SHunter Reading the good and the bad above, how the hell can you say this is a breath of fresh air? Are you high? stefan djordjevic No led notification light for 700$ .. lol surethom Really that's a deal breaker for me. Eclectech What's the point in having an LED notification light if the phone has an always on display that shows your notifications? stefan djordjevic Because I don't won't aod ? Can I have a choice on a 700$ phone. Lol Eclectech Choice?? You must be from a different Earth. Our Earth has makers like Apple who decide you don't need a headphone jack. Other features introduced then removed thru the years include IR blasters, kickstands and stereo speakers. Jedediah Hiscock Just preordered one from my carrier today. $297.00 promo card for the preorder so I'll only end up paying $300, can't complain to much for the price, and will be a nice upgrade from the G3. surethom No led notifications REALLY? that's the killer there. Second is always the camera & what are u doing LG please improve with a software update. Looks like it will be Samsung again. MattPortland Why do you need with an always on display? Margaritas Ante Porcos LG should have bundled this crap with tons of other crap and price it $2000. Why not? They are slipping Home crap and tv crap with G6 for 700+ bucks. This is insane. Also LG simply can't get it. People don't need mediocre phones for premium price. LG will be shedding crocs tears in few months. Joshua Hill In Australia they're bundling a free 40" full HD tv for absolutely nothing more ;) We do however get the Australia tax. For paying more what do Australians get??? No quad DAC no wireless charging. Stick your free tv where the sun don't shine LG and just give Aussies a decent version of the phone if we have to pay more for it! joseph carmine nero why not call it expensive?if this was a sony phone with SD821 AP would be screaming expensive Marty Yeah, 700+ for some reason makes Sony a bad guy. Joshua Hill I have owned 3 Sony's, currently my phone and tablet are both Sony's. My problem with Sony is they are expensive and don't tick all the basic boxes David was talking about in this review. In that sense they are over priced where as the G6 isn't. Having said that AP is probably the most biased tech site I regularly visit. It seems to be a choice they've made as they've been like this as long as I can remember and show no signs of changing to a more neutral/balanced reporting style. smonkeyball Since you have the Verizon model, would you tell us how it is in terms of bloatware or disabled features? G4 Verizon owner here, was pretty disappointed by the number of cool things it was supposed to do but cannot do. Unlike on other carriers. Arysyn I decided that I had no interest in the LG G6 from the first moment I heard of some of its specs, such as the SD821 (no 835, which I think if LG had to release this early, they could have gone with a high-end product from a Qualcomm competitor), no Quad Dac here in the U.S., a mixture of older Gorilla Glass implementations (not fully Gorilla Glass 5), etc. In fact, the only reason I read this review, was to see what David had to say bad about this device. Not that I'm trying to be negative about LG. After all, I own an LG OLED television that I like. However, I think this product just seems rushed to me. As if LG was in a hurry to update the G line, just because they wanted something to replace their failed G5. I believe this is a mistake that is going to show them once the Samsung Galaxy S8 devices get launched, so long as they don't blow up within weeks of launch. Although, it is very unlikely Samsung will not have corrected the Note 7 issues in the S8, which other than the lack of stylus, looks to be Note-like in terms of display size finally. Tomorrow certainly will be a big day. wade_county FYI: Gorilla Glass has hit a wall. GG5 is less prone to shatter but more prone to scratches (hence most of the back of the G6) GG4 is less prone for scratches (its on the G6 camera lens) duke69111 "I like to check my notifications without unlocking the screen. You could make the fingerprint reader key a custom button. Just a suggestion." Did they do away with double tap on screen to wake? David Ruddock No, it's still there. I just don't find it very reliable / I don't like "hitting" my phone when it's lying on a flat surface. duke69111 Ok, good deal. That's probably one of my favorite features on LG's phones. I wish more phone makers would incorporate this feature. Marty Sony does. D13H4RD2L1V3 Android 7.0? Didn't LG say it was gonna launch with 7.1? David Ruddock They got back to me: it's launching with 7.0. Bewear "Fresh air". Marty Of this phone and the OnePlus 3T, which one would people be more interested in buying? Marty Nobody has an opinion? Joshua Hill Neither, both too big imo ;) Marty If the size didn't matter? Joshua Hill If I was in to big phones the LG if the quad DAC model was available. This different models for different regions is bs and damaging to LG's brand! The model in my region has no wireless charging and no quad dac, so in practical terms the 3T. But the 3t is not officially available in my region and just as expensive as a S7 edge. So in real practical terms, still neither I would get the S7 edge or the sony xz premium if it was a decent price. Marty Yeah, the Premium would be good to have. It's too big, but it'd be a sweet phone. I'm also into smaller phones. Would much rather have a 5" device. Bought an Xperia XP and saw it's as big as devices with larger displays thanks to the chins. My ideal would be an Xperia X Compact with the specs of the Premium. Joshua Hill Unfortunately looks like Sony's compacts have just become mini's. They should really change the name as when Sony introduced 'compact' it was synonymous with flagship specs in a smaller device. Joshua Hill My ideal would be an S8 with a 0.2 - 0.3" smaller screen. For some reason I've set an arbitrary limit of 14cm maximum height for a phone. It's not truly arbitrary, it has to do with fitting in front pants pockets comfortably. Or if Sony would ever release a Z3 compact size device with a bezel-less screen. Marty I wear cargo pants...plenty of pockets...and I keep my large phone in one of those leg pockets. My Xperia I keep in a belt case. Marty I've changed my mind about Sony phones. No more for me. It's unacceptable that we here in the US can't have the convenience of a functioning fingerprint scanner. Matthew Bowe Why aren't we complaining about the missing IR port? Good_Ole_Pinocchio Because it's 2017 Andy J I really want it, but I'm sitting here with a less than 2 year old LGG4, having been through the news that it was not going to get Nougat - through to the news it will later in the year, but probably won't be terribly stable...... It makes it extremely difficult to justify spending £700 on a G6 that in 12 months will be a second class citizen as far as LG is concerned - and might not even get an upgrade to Android O...... paxmos Not a peexol fan but all you haters would kiss googel's ass if you had one in your hands. Since when LG has become a "breath of fresh air" with their phones?...LG = Liteary Garbage MeCampbell30 "I can definitely tell I'm not using a Samsung phone, I'll say that much." Can we get some Aloe vera for that burn? Cakefish No point, Samsung phones are always burning. Boom boom! I'll show myself out... Sayantan Chaudhuri I appreciate the risks that had to be taken for this _deep dive_ into the G6. Diego Kaku a good $400 phone, old chip, old glass, not first bezeless, wierd 18:9, smal battery. BrianB Someone's a pixel fanboy MattPortland Oh hell. 🙄 Shailesh Kumar All I know is that whoever clicked those phone pictures for this review has done an awesome job. Appreciate it. DJ SPY LG did something right. Since 2010, I've only owned Motorola and Google devices. Oh and I decided to try out the iPhone when Verizon had their $20 a month sale on it. Anyway, I pre ordered the G6 last week. I'm excited to see what this experience brings. It's been an interesting one wth the iPhone so far. I plan on using the G6 "as is" for a week or two to really get the feel of what LG is doing with their phones. Eddy Witkamp How can the battery life be both exceptionally good, but also bad? It's in both columns Eddy Witkamp @rdr0b11:disqus can you explain? Cakefish The only issue I have with reviews of the G6 is that reviewers only talk about the speed of the Snapdragon 821, as if it's the only thing that matters. They seem to forget that 821 is 14nm and 835 is 10nm. The latter will have superior power efficiency and thus, superior battery life in devices with equivalent battery capacities. Chazz Matthews OnePlus 3T doesn't have 1440p nor Qi wirleless charging. Until it does, there's no comparison. I won't buy a phone without either of those two features. aatifsumar Where's my removable battery grumbling thread? 3223 One thing i wish i knew from the review, in fact all reviews of this phone - does it have adoptable storage tho? Lg disabled it for their g5 afaik... KVragec In Croatia this will probably be cheaper than S8 so I'll probably go with G6. But S8 is crazy tempting. My G4 is now 2 years old and I'll change it for one of those Da Fuq I really want to like this phone, but the front of the S8 just looks so much better, curved or not.

The first set was even - and Rafa could have won it - but the second serve was pretty one-sided as Roger found his serve.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.48pm EDT 14:48 Roger Federer wins the Miami Open 6-3, 6-4 Both players jog back from their seats to big cheers. Roger shows even the best of us get nerves when he starts the game with a double fault. Then he does something, which separates him from the rest of us - the smoothest of backhands down the line to make it 15-15. Rafa shakes his head and allows himself a rueful smile as a crashing forehand clips the line and brings up match point. Roger’s serve is too good - Rafa can only bat it long and it’s another title for the great man.

He’s not helped when an unthreatening forehand from Roger clips the net and forces Rafa to scramble to the front of the court.

And it’s a good one too as Roger powers a forehand that Rafa can only dribble into the net and for the first time this set one of our stars looks a little wobbly on serve. Roger scents blood and batters away at Rafa’s forehand until the Spaniard sends one long to make it 30-40. But Rafa’s not done! He closes Roger off at the net and sends a volley down the centre of the court to make it deuce. We get a “Come on” and a fist pump from Rafa as a reward. Rafa goes on to hold - that was an important one. Not only did he keep himself in the match, the flirtation with disaster seems to have energised Rafa and he looks very peppy indeed now. And very sweaty too, in truth.

He made it look as easy as a stroll to the shops to pick up some milk (assuming your nearest shop isn’t at the top of a cliff or anything). Anyway the easiest of holds to love. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.16pm EDT 14:16 Second set: Federer 6-3, 1-2 Nadal* (*denotes server) After the furious break-point-tastic energy of the firs set, this one has started out a little sedately with both men looking a little more comfortable on serve. Not sure if both of them are catching their breath in the heat. And just as I say that, Roger floats to the net to hit a zinging forehand winner. Rafa does hold though, which proves my point. To an extent. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.13pm EDT 14:13 Second set:* Federer 6-3, 1-1 Nadal (*denotes server) As if to emphasize this match’s old school qualities, the early 2000s (Brazilian) Ronaldo is in the crowd rather than 2010s peppy upstart (Portuguese) Ronaldo. Although that’s perhaps not that surprising given that Cristiano Ronaldo played for Real in Spain about three hours ago. A good hold for Roger. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.10pm EDT 14:10 Second set: Federer 6-3, 0-1 Nadal* (*denotes server) So, Roger took the first set but it was by no means a stroll and it could easily be Rafa sitting down at the break with a first set lead - Federer’s struggling to get his first serve in but Rafa hasn’t take the chances - he had four break point opportunities. Roger also leads the winner count 18-9. One thing to bear in mind in this heat and humidity - Rafa has spent a lot less time on court in the last few days. He looks fresh enough as he digs out a forehand from under his feet to hit a superb winner. A comfortable hold. “People often tend to get carried away in the world of tennis, I’ve found. Everyone is calling three tournaments (AO and the last two Masters) as the ‘fightback of the old establishment’. I hate to be a nostalgia killer but Sir Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic are still the top two players in the world and the ‘new old establishment’ will strike back come the claycourt season and beyond. What do you think?” Well, Rafa isn’t too bad on clay so I wouldn’t rule him out of the French Open but I don’t see him winning consistently again. But Roger ... I think he’s still got a good few years in him. The way he’s played recently suggests he has evolved - which is crazy at his age. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.01pm EDT 14:01 Federer wins the first set 6-3 Federer’s forehand has been exemplary today, even if his serving has been distinctly average. His 12th forehand winner makes it 15-0 and for the first time this afternoon Nadal gives Roger an easy service game as two limp backhands gift the Swiss the game ... and the set. Updated at 2.02pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.59pm EDT 13:59 Federer breaks! First set: Federer 5-3 Nadal* (*denotes server) Once again, one of our protagonists finds himself in trouble on his serve - and once again he negotiates a way out. Rafa rips a backhand down the line - it was breaking the speed limit in most countries around the world - before another forehand winner from Roger makes it 30-40. A healthy dose of deuces then ensues (I believe the technical term is Epic Tussle) before we have a break when Nadal nets. That one was coming - but it could have been either player that lost their serve. “Tom, with all this talk of greatest players of history, where would you rank MaliVai Washington in the pile,” says Pat Boivin. “Also Michael Chang, Petr Korda and Gael Monfils?” Ummm. I would say Nos 198, 114, 208456 and 56. But only because Korda owes me money. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.49pm EDT 13:49 First set: *Federer 4-3 Nadal (*denotes server) Roger is giving Rafa a lot of chances to face his second serve and does so again a few times in this game. Rafa batters his way to 30-40 with some huge shots - the decisive one Roger simply can’t control and a volley flies wide. But Roger hits back with an incredibly hard crosscourt winner that he makes look simple. Roger wins the game ... just. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.44pm EDT 13:44 First set: Federer 3-3 Nadal* (*denotes server) There haven’t been too many easy holds so far - it’s almost like each player is facing one of the greatest tennis geniuses of all time. Nadal has to be at his best to stay in the point at 0-15, and it’s just as well because Federer is attacking his serve early. Roger then scoops out a dipping backhand from Rafa and dumps it back at him to bring up break point - both players could conceivably have broken a couple of times so far. Rafa - as he has done a few times today - brings it back with some big serves late in the game. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.37pm EDT 13:37 First set: *Federer 3-2 Nadal (*denotes server) Roger sends a nasty, kicking serve out wide to Rafa’s forehand at 40-30 but the Spaniard dismisses it with a booming forehand down the line to make it deuce. Roger had looked pretty comfortable until then and Rafa has a chance to break a couple of points letter - he looks disappointed as he sends a shot into the net and he should be, it was a decent opening. Federer holds. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.33pm EDT 13:33 First set: Federer 2-2 Nadal* (*denotes server) A chance for Federer at 0-30. Rafa does a little fist pump (maybe 15% of his full capacity) as a nasty backhand from Roger floats just long to make it 15-30 and relieve the pressure a little. But Roger brings up 30-40 when Rafa sends his own backhand long. Rafa saves that one - he’s sweating heavily already in the humidity - but some strong serving helps him hold. A little more on who’s winning the Masters title count. “Before the Masters events there was the Super Series, from 1970-1989 (under a few different guises),” writes Greg Crowther. “Same idea though - 9 most prestigious events after Slams and Year End tournaments, some the same as the current Masters 1000 such as Monte Carlo, Rome, Canada. Lendl won 22, McEnroe 19, Connors 17, Borg 15....Federer, Nadal and Djokovic still outstrip them all.” Updated at 1.35pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.24pm EDT 13:24 First set: *Federer 2-1 Nadal (*denotes server) A wild serve from Roger at 40-15 - his radar (on his serve at least) is a little off today. But an equally wild backhand from Rafa helps Roger hold. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.21pm EDT 13:21 First set: Federer 1-1 Nadal* (*denotes server) Yikes! Federer’s serve may be off but his forehand is fizzing. He hits his fifth forehand winner of the match to make it 15-15 - it skimmed the baseline and Rafa didn’t even bother to run after it. Make that six forehand winners as Roger makes it 40-30. An ace wins the game for Rafa though. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.18pm EDT 13:18 First set: *Federer 1-0 Nadal (*denotes server) It’s steamy conditions in Miami with very high humidity - will that play a part after Federer’s leg-sapping victory over Kyrgios on Friday night? Roger will serve first - and wins the first point after Rafa hits a weak forehand into the net. Rafa does a lot better with an 88mph crosscourt backhand to edge to 15-30 and that leads to a break point on the first game of the match. Roger looks to have saved it with a big forehand early on but Rafa stays in the point - just about - until his opponent come into the net to take it to deuce. There’s another break point but Roger eventually serves it out. Roger’s serve didn’t look great in that game though - and Rafa had chances to attack. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.01pm EDT 13:01 The players are out on court so we’ll be starting soon. Rafa is first out, sporting a day-glo yellow shirt. Roger comes out to big cheers dressed in green. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.58pm EDT 12:58 “Hello Tom, says Woolie Madden. “Cracking weather, isn’t it? Gives me chance to air my own fuzzy Dunlops out. I was wondering if you had the numbers to hand for total Masters titles for the Big Four, and how they compare with history’s greatest – Jimmy Connors had the most, if I remember correctly?” I do! Jimmy Connors has the most me’s titles in the Open era (109) compared to Ivan Lendl (94), Federer (90) McEnroe (77) and Nadal (69). But Djokovic has the most Masters 1000 titles: 30. Nadal has 28, Federer 25 and Murray 14. But seeing as a few of the Masters tournaments didn’t exist until after Lendl and Connors had retired and weren’t even called Masters until after 1990 the fact that the Big Four dominate the list isn’t that surprising. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.49pm EDT 12:49 “While I’m all warm and fuzzy about the Nadal-Federer bromance/rivalry being rekindled, I do wonder how much it is to do with them getting loads better and how much it is to do with Djokovic (hanging out with his guru) and Murray (injury) not being at their best,” writes Alex Fitzsimmons. I’d say a bit of both. But Nadal has benefitted most from Murray and Djokovic’s downturns - while he’s been good, Roger has actually improved. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.41pm EDT 12:41 We all know about Federer’s resurgence - he’s 18-1 to start the year - but Rafa has put up impressive numbers so far in Miami. He’s leading his rival in 1st serve percentage (71% to 57%), service games won (92% to 91%), break points saved (67% to 60%) and break points converted (48% to 26%). Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.36pm EDT 12:36 The Big Four (Nadal, Murray, Djokovic and Soderli Federer) have won 57 of the last 62 Masters titles and surprisingly – to me, anyway – it is Roger who trails the pack. In order we have Djokovic (25), Nadal (13), Murray (10) and Federer (9). Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.20pm EDT 12:20 The two players have some history in Miami. They played their first competitive match against each other at this tournament in 2004, with the 17 year-old (awww, look at him) Nadal winning in straight sets. A year later, they met in the final with Federer winning over five sets. Since then, Rafa has had the better of Roger he leads the series 23-13 although the Swiss has won their last three meetings. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.10pm EDT 12:10 Federer v Nadal: Part [checks Roman numerals extra hard] XXXVII ... ... or, as the ATP website would have it, their 37th FedEx ATP Head2Head meeting. As both men contemplate the ageing process (although both are doing a pretty good job of ignoring it) they’ve adopted a loving tone about a relationship that was kind of warm and fuzzy to begin with. Here’s Roger on today’s FedEx ATP Head2Head meeting: “It feels like old times. We’re playing each other every week now. We can’t get enough of each other,” Federer said. Is there a word that means nostalgia, romance and athleticism all the same time? If it’s not FedEx ATP Head2Head meeting then it should be. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.46am EDT 11:46 Hello! I had a terrible nightmare last night that it was 2017 and the world was zooming towards the apocalypse, robots were after my job, Criminal Minds was still on TV and Stan Wawrinka had won three grand slams. But then I read that it’s Nadal v Federer in a Masters final and was reassured we’re still back in good old 2009. I wonder if Andy Murray will ever win Wimbledon? Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.28am EDT 10:28 Tom will be here shortly, in the meantime here’s Andrew Anthony on Roger’s resurgence: Two comeback kids met in Miami and played a very fine match of tennis this week. One was Juan Martín del Potro, the lanky, lugubrious Argentinian who has suffered two career-threatening wrist injuries. Since returning last year, after a two‑year hiatus, he narrowly lost to Andy Murray in the Olympic final and led Argentina to their first Davis Cup win. His is an uplifting story of triumph over adversity, stalwart determination in the face of debilitating physical and psychological setbacks. He played beautifully this week, with his elegant backhand slice and his thunderous slap of a forehand. But unfortunately for him he was up against Roger Federer, who, at 35 and following his own long lay-off with a knee injury and then a back injury, is playing perhaps the best tennis of his life. Given that Federer is arguably the best player in history, that would make his tennis right now the best there has ever been. That’s an extremely large claim that is probably easier to shoot down than support. But there is no doubt that Federer, that most heavenly of players, is enjoying a second coming at an age when most top players are either retired or long past their peak.

One of the developments was the launch of the Reliance Jio Summer Surprise offer on Friday, which was supposed to be the last day of signing up for Jio Prime. Now, the last date for signing up for Jio Prime is April 15. Users who sign up for Jio Prime on or before April 15 (including users who have already signed up for the service) and also sign up for a Rs. 303 (or higher) plan, will get three more months of free service - a benefit that Reliance Jio is calling the Jio Summer Surprise. Reliance Jio has been free to use since its launch in September 2016, and users who sign up for the Jio Prime subscription offer from Reliance Jio with the above-mentioned conditions get an additional three months of free usage. Reliance Jio Prime vs Non-Jio Prime Plans: These are the Extra Benefits Customers Get   Reliance Jio announced on Friday that 72 million users subscribed to Prime before the initially announced March 31 deadline, a pretty healthy number by all accounts. How to Check Reliance Jio Balance Earlier in the week, we had what could arguably be called the launch of the year (at least for Android fans) - the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. At the event, Samsung stressed how the new Galaxy S8 is the "start of a new era." The company also showcased its in-house voice-based virtual assistant named Bixby, which makes its debut on the flagship Galaxy S8. Samsung Galaxy S8 full specifications Both phones feature curved edges - called an "Infinity Display" - and feature bezel-less faces, to present a stunning front. To accomplish this, the physical home button has been removed, and the fingerprint scanner moved to the back of the device, next to the camera. Samsung Galaxy S8+ full specifications   As rumoured for months, the all-new Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ also sport iris recognition, which was earlier seen on the now discontinued Samsung Galaxy Note 7. As the name suggests, the biometric recognition scans iris to unlock the phone, verify Samsung account, and more. Both the handsets pack 4GB of RAM and come with 64GB inbuilt storage while also supporting expandable storage via microSD card (up to 256GB). Both the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ will come powered by Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 835 SoC (2.3GHz Quad + 1.7GHz Quad) in the US, while most international markets (including India) will get the Exynos 8895 SoC (2.35GHz Quad + 1.9GHz Quad). Samsung Galaxy S8 vs iPhone 7 Plus vs OnePlus 3T vs LG G6 In Hyderabad on Thursday, ACT Fibernet announced the launch of India's first gigabit Internet service. The company is offering 1Gbps speeds to home users for Rs. 5,999 per month, with a 1TB (1000GB) download fair usage policy (FUP) limit, followed by a post FUP speed of 10Mbps per month. ACT has launched the service in Hyderabad because that's where almost half of its users are, explained ACT CEO Bala Malladi, but he promised that ACT will be bringing the gigabit connections to all the cities that ACT is active in, over time. ACT has committed to spending Rs. 1,000 crore in the next 18 to 24 months as part of its national rollout and infrastructure building. ACT Fibernet on Building India's Gigabit Networks   Truecaller also held a press conference in Delhi this week where it unveiled Truecaller 8 for Android, which comes with a large number of new features that update the app significantly. For one thing, Truecaller is now integrated with Google Duo, so users will be able to return calls via Google's video-calling platform. Another new feature is called Truecaller Pay - a UPI-based payments provider running in partnership with ICICI Bank. Truecaller Pay is a part of the main Truecaller app itself, and allows you to send or receive money from anyone in your contact list after you've linked your bank account. And since it's UPI-based, you can use any bank account, not just ICICI. Truecaller also announced a partnership with Airtel to bring its caller identification service to feature phones, even to devices without Internet access. Truecaller 8 for Android Brings SMS Inbox, Flash Messaging, Truecaller Pay, and More Also this week was the launch of the Micromax Dual 5. Priced at Rs. 24,999, it is going to be available via Flipkart from April 10. It will also be sold from the Micromax E-Store, as well as from offline stores. The biggest highlight of the Micromax Dual 5 is its dual rear camera setup. This will enable greater contrast, better low light performance, and more accurate depth of field, as well as 3D video functionality according to Micromax.   Apart from this, the Micromax Dual 5 also comes with a 5.5-inch full-HD display, powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 652 SoC, running an octa-core 1.8GHz CPU, and 4GB of RAM, and packing 128GB of inbuilt storage. Micromax Dual 5 First Impressions Phil Schiller, Senior Vice President Worldwide Marketing at Apple was in Bengaluru on Friday where he launched an app accelerator in India. The goal of the accelerator is to provide advice from experts on a wide variety of topics such as app design, marketing, as well as deep-dive sessions of Apple technologies like Metal, and detailed feedback on their existing apps. Apple to Begin iPhone Assembly in Bengaluru in Less Than a Month, Says IT Minister Idea also launched a new postpaid pack for Rs. 300 giving you 1GB data per day, very similar to Reliance Jio's Rs. 303 plan. However, if you're on a higher rental plan - of Rs. 499 and above - then you can avail of this offer at no extra charge.   And Airtel has just gotten a setback - it's been asked by the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) to withdraw its advertisements where broadband tester Ookla declared Airtel to be the "Fastest Mobile Network" in India, following a complaint to ASCI by Reliance Jio. It's worth pointing out that ASCI's role is limited to self-regulation and the body cannot enforce any of its decisions on advertisers, but it sends its reports to several ministries. Airtel said it will file an appeal as per the guidelines. Reliance Jio, Airtel Fight Over Speedtest App Results: What’s Really Happening The UPI rollout continues meanwhile - the NPCI has launched in-store UPI payments with Reliance Retail. The POS machine at the store generates a QR code which you can scan with your UPI app to make the payments. And finally, in a move that's drawn a lot of flak from users, social network Twitter rolled out its latest feature - removing @usernames from replies, in theory to allow additional characters in replies and to give a clearer timeline. In practice though, it just makes things look confusing, and makes Twitter harder to navigate for people who have stuck with it for a long time. These were the highlights of the week - tell us what caught your eye via the comments, or point out more for the other readers.

And that’s that. A draw is a fair result. Both teams looked tired and flaky and neither did enough to win that game. I suspect Arsenal will be happier having stopped the rot and scored a couple of goals that should give them just a little bit of confidence despite the defensive deficiencies. Arsène Wenger will still feel the heat from his detractors but there was nothing too vocal for him to contend with from the home crowd today. As for City, they need to sharpen up before Chelsea on Wednesday. Spurs, Liverpool and Manchester United fans will have enjoyed that result. Thanks for your emails. Bye. Manchester City, dejected after the final whistle. Photograph: Mike Hewitt/Getty Images Updated at 1.02pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.51pm EDT 12:51 90+2 min: Arsenal get pinned in in the right-back position. They clear half-heartedly and City work the ball over to the right. Navas cuts into the box and clips the ball over Monreal before making an appeal for handball. It was clumsy and really did seem like it struck his flailing arm. Arsenal appear to have been lucky to get away with that there. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.48pm EDT 12:48 90 min: Arsenal win a free-kick on the right, 30 yards out by the touchline. Ozil swings it in to the back post were absolutely no Arsenal players are stationed. Textbook lads. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.47pm EDT 12:47 89 min: It’s end to end in a weird, tired kind of way. Navas has a shot at goal from 20 yards out on the right that never had any conviction about it. And Silva is off and Zabaleta is on. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.46pm EDT 12:46 87 min: Iwobi slams a shot over after a sweeping Arsenal attack that actually began with Sanchez slipping in the Arsenal half and almost letting City in on goal. The upshot was that Arsenal were able to counter and Iwobi had a shy from 15 yards on the inside-right channel just inside the City penalty area. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.45pm EDT 12:45 86 min: Caballero passes the ball straight out of play with Giroud bearing down on him. Arsenal push men forwards and now it’s their turn to attack. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.43pm EDT 12:43 84 min: Silva drags a shot wide from 20 yards after Touré neatly pulled the ball back to him on the edge of the box. A moment later, De Bruyne clatters a shot off an Arsenal defender and that head of steam I thought Arsenal were building, is pretty much blown away in a strong gust of attacking play from City. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.41pm EDT 12:41 82 min: De Bruyne is incensed after being fouled. He waves an imaginary card around. Come on now. Stay classy. Meanwhile, Arsenal are building up a head of steam. Well, OK, that’s pushing it. But they’re on top at the moment. “From a neutral perspective, both teams here are doing a ruddy good job of inspiring Tottenham - anything less than a win for Arsenal surely derails St Tottering’s day, and anything less than a win for City leaves them three points shy of Spurs. Could it be a two horse race for the title after the final whistle blows?” wonders Matt Kingscote. Two-horse? There’s only one horse in town isn’t there, despite the stumble yesterday. Updated at 12.42pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.38pm EDT 12:38 79 min: Otamendi gifts a chance to Ozil after, bizarrely, choosing not to head a long ball clear and instead sidefoot it towards Stones only to present it at Ozil’s feet beside him. Ozil takes a touch and – when confronted with Caballero – hesitates and then takes a heavy touch past him and out of play. If he’s been sharper in both body and mind he could have stabbed that at goal first time. Caballero faces off Ozil.

Neither side are going for it like they were just before and just after half-time. Or maybe they’re both knackered. The pace has certainly dropped. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.35pm EDT 12:35 77 min: City win a corner on the left. It’s played short to De Bruyne. he gives it back to Silva, who tries to find Fernandinho on the edge of the box only to see it cut out. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.34pm EDT 12:34 76 min: Iwobi is on for Welbeck. He races on looking a little lost as to where he should go. I hope, for his sake, that’s not a sign of things to come. Updated at 12.34pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.33pm EDT 12:33 75 min: Navas floats a ball over the Arsenal defence towards Agüero but Ospina is off his line quick-sharp to clutch the ball and quell the danger. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.32pm EDT 12:32 73 min: City are bossing things in midfield again. It’s a slower paced approach but Arsenal aren’t getting a sniff. Pass, pass, pass, pass, pass. Sané has a go at getting in behind but he’s forced back and then Fernandinho, who has been a greater creative force today then I’ve ever judged him to be, tries to slip in Agüero only for Mustafi to rush in and clear the danger. City are back in possession though. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.30pm EDT 12:30 71 min: “In honour of #Wrestlemania will Giroud be the late locker room run-in who cleans house and saves the day?” asks Hubert O’Hearn. Erm, no. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.28pm EDT 12:28 68 min: Touré rolls back the years and swerves inside a challenge on the edge of the box before slipping the ball towards Sane on the left only for Bellerin to nip in and take it off his foot. Touré has slowed things down in City’s midfield since his arrival. Such a towering player in his pomp. He’ll score the winner now won’t he? Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.26pm EDT 12:26 66 min: There are videos swirling around social media of Arsenal fans fighting among themselves at the Emirates. Grown adults. Deary me.

Welbeck doesn’t quite bring it under his spell and City escape. This is such a strange game. Both sides a utterly unconvincing at the back. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.19pm EDT 12:19 61 min: A tweet. Darren (@TheViewFromA1) @GreggBakowski You can't count goals from corners conceded by Arsenal or Manchester City. They're both statistically deviant. April 2, 2017 Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.19pm EDT 12:19 59 min: Xhaka is lucky to be on the pitch. In the buildup to that City chance he clattered into Touré with a dire challenge, catching the Ivorian’s back leg. He could have done him harm but Touré doesn’t make much of it. He should be grateful to him for that. Even Paul Scholes would have been embarrassed by that technique. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.16pm EDT 12:16 57 min: Well, that has opened things up somewhat. City are back at it immediately. they play a number of sharp passes through midfield to work their way into the Arsenal half. The ball is then worked wide to Navas, who fizzes a ball into the box that Arsenal do well to clear. Fernandinho controls the ball on his chest and lashes a shot at the bottom corner that Ospina does well to parry with strong hands. A moment later he takes a dig in the ribs as a cross comes into the box and that’s a free-kick and some breathing room. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.13pm EDT 12:13 54 min: Arsenal have Monreal to thank for creating the corner. His whipped-in delivery from the left forced Otamendi to head wide. The resulting corner was swung out to the edge of the six-yard box, where Mustafi beat Otamendi to the jump and guided the ball down into the far corner expertly. It was a great header. It was a goal off a corner. It was one in the eye for the 96.8% of corners that lead to nothing.

He takes one touch and drills in a cross to the near-post that slams into Aguero’s forehead and wide. It was far too pacey for Aguero to control. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.08pm EDT 12:08 50 min: Sane is some player. He oozes calm. And he’s so young. He knows when to put his foot on the accelerator and when not to. Something young English players would be mindful to be aware of. He forces throw-in from Mustafi, who has had a torrid game so far. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.07pm EDT 12:07 48 min: “There used to be a Paul Whitehouse Radio 4 spoof radio call-in show which included a character whose only line, endlessly repeated, was “what is point?”. You sense that he might have been an Arsenal supporter,” writes Charles Antaki. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.05pm EDT 12:05 46 min: Navas appears to be staying at right-back. Hope for Arsenal then. Touré plays a loose pass and forces Fernandinho into a cycnical foul on Sanchez. He’s booked and Arsenal get a free-kick midway inside the City half. Touré was shedding rust in his first few creaky movements there. You could pretty much see the flakes coming off him. The Arsenal free-kick is cleared easily by the way. Sanchez appeals to referee Andre Marriner.

Here we go then. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.02pm EDT 12:02 Gabriel has come on for Koscielny in the second half. I’m presuming that’s an enforced change and not a tactical one. I mentioned before that Kompany is on the City bench. Could they use him or is that just a wasted substitution. Oh, Sterling is off and Touré is on. Pace for pace then. Ahem.

Updated at 11.52am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.48am EDT 11:48 45 min: Sanchez dances Navas into a stupor on the left flank before dinking a delicious ball in to Walcott on the edge of the box. He takes a touch and stabs a shot at goal that misses narrowly, grazing the top-netting. If he’d had a little more zen about him he could have let that drop a little further before he struck it. There are more goals in this, you’ll be glad to hear.

City race forwards from kick-off as though affronted. De Bruyne clatters a post with a shot and then from the rebound he plays a one-two with Silva and then a clearance and a razor sharp David Silva pass later the ball is at Agüero’s feet in the box on the right hand side. His eyes light up. He loves this kind of chance. His shot is arrowed into the bottom corner. Advantage City (again). Aguero scores City’s second.

Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Reuters Updated at 11.40am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.33am EDT 11:33 30 min: Arsenal are clearly targeting Navas in the right-back position. So many of their passes are being drifted in behind the little Spaniard. Fernandinho gets him out of trouble as Welbeck picks up the ball behind him, sliding in and getting a foot to the ball in what could quite easily have been a mistimed tackle and penalty. Moments later, Sanchez drops a shoulder and sends a curler way up and over the City goal.

It appears that Marriner didn’t see it. Sterling clearly felt it though and irately tells the referee how much it stung.

Coverage of Disruptive Science and Technology Forum About Contact Facebook twitter Google March 30, 2017 Google Launched a New Machine Learning Journal and it support reactive diagrams artificial intelligence, computers, deep learning, google, machine learning, science Facebook Twitter linkedin google Reddit In collaboration with OpenAI, DeepMind, YC Research, and others, Google has announced the launch of Distill, a new open science journal and ecosystem supporting human understanding of machine learning. Distill is an independent organization, dedicated to fostering a new segment of the research community. We can create interactive diagrams and user interfaces the enable intuitive exploration of research ideas. Reactive diagrams allow for a type of communication not possible in static mediums. Hover over this diagram to see how a neural turing machine shifts its attention over its old memory values to create new values. Unfortunately, while there are a plethora of conferences and journals in machine learning, there aren’t any research venues that are dedicated to publishing this kind of work. This is partly an issue of focus, and partly because traditional publication venues can't, by virtue of their medium, support interactive visualizations. Without a venue to publish in, many significant contributions don’t count as “real academic contributions” and their authors can’t access the academic support structure. That’s why Distill aims to build an ecosystem to support this kind of work, starting with three pieces: a research journal, prizes recognizing outstanding work, and tools to facilitate the creation of interactive articles.

And now Google is back at it again, with yet another way to simplify your life: Reserve with Google is a new platform that makes it super easy to discover and book fitness classes. The site allows you to search your area for upcoming classes, and reserve and pay for a spot instantly. If you're signed into your Google account, some of your info (like your name, email, and phone number) will pre-load to make booking even faster. The service kicked off in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, and is now available across the country, thanks to partnerships with booking services you may already know and love, such as Mindbody, Genbook, and MyTime. Reserve with Google also makes recommendations to help you discover new ways to get your sweat on, complete with class descriptions, pricing, and reviews-so you know exactly what you're signing up for. And the “Discover more around you” section groups suggestions into categories like “Yoga this evening” and “Pilates before work.” Really want to mix it up? You can choose Google's notorious “I’m feeling lucky" option. To help you fit your workouts into your schedule, the service works with Google Maps (so you get a visual of the closest gyms and studios) and Google Calendar (so you can block off precious time). Whether you're looking to try a new activity, or schedule out a full week of exercise, this platform can help you do so seamlessly. And once you're sufficiently sore, it'll help you search for massage appointments (and other spa services) nearby to help your body bounce back.

How can you support a president who is making students pay a higher rate on their loans, lets companies sell your personal information, wants to take health care away from many of his supporters and wants to cancel meals on wheels and food for poor students?

Android Wear 2.0 update is arriving on six more watches, but still no mainstream ones Richard Gao Follow View All Posts 2017/03/31 5:57pm PDTMar 31, 2017 17 Plus 1 on G+ 37 Share on Facebook 62 Share on Twitter Total Shares116 Android Wear Google News Yesterday, Google finally gave a reason on why most Android Wear watches still haven't received the long-awaited 2.0 update: "a bug found in final testing." Some commenters speculated that this might have something to do with Snapdragon chipsets, given how the first few watches that received the update used chipsets from other manufacturers. That being said, five of the six watches on today's list sport the Snapdragon 2100. This news comes courtesy of our pal Ernest the community manager over at Google's Android Wear support forums. Without further ado, here's the list: Polar M600 Fossil Q Wander Fossil Q Marshal Michael Kors ACCESS Bradshaw Michael Kors ACCESS Dylan Nixon The Mission We already wrote about AW2.0 going out to the Polar M600, which also happens to be the only watch on this list that isn't powered by a Snapdragon 2100; it has a MediaTek MT2601, which no other Android Wear watch uses. Fun fact of the day right here. Those of us with more mainstream offerings like the Huawei Watch and Moto 360 2nd Gen are still out here waiting. I guess it's good that Google's making sure the final software is bug-free, but us techies are an impatient bunch.

I can not get it to show up on my Nixon Mission Tyler Shortt Nothing yet for mine either Sootie Same :( NexusMan It's rolling out gradually. My watch was amongst the 1st batch to get it a few days ago, and I got it the very 1st day it was announced, late afternoon. But they said the rollout will go until this upcoming Tuesday. And I didn't get it while checking. It just popped up and downloaded. Sam Yay finally for the Mission!!!! :D I feel like that's a pretty mainstream one, no?

They "cleaned" the pins... Sent it back... Still wouldn't charge... They finally replaced after I sent it in again. Frustrating to be without the watch for a few weeks but the new one seems to be holding up pretty well after a month... Orlando aka Pixel XL I haven't even gone scuba diving or snorkeling yet.. I'm worried about it even lasting... WTF, they cleaned it? How did your know it wasn't brand new? Impulse_Vigil It uses pogo pins? Do they sit right against the wrist? I noticed on my new ZW3 they're sort of inset a little on the casing bit I'm still concerned about it long term, as much as I like ASUS products their support has never been great. Orlando aka Pixel XL Yup jstew182 Yeah I haven't worn mine in any water at all...Not even the shower. I am not a fan of the pogo pins...Had a similar issue with my original lg g watch when it first came out. Nixon sent a brand new one back to me the second time tho. It was in new packaging and never opened before. I'm hoping it was an early manufacturing defect causing the pogo pins to corrode and it won't be an ongoing issue. Hopefully the next iteration of the watch will have wireless charging to alleviate this issue all together. Daisy <-By working on Facebook I'm making $90 to $120 per hour.

The Mission is very well known in that line of people, or at least a load of strangers I have met have said on mountains or in the sea "Hey, that's that Nixon!". rohiggidy ignore the shitty headline. Android blogs think android oem watches = mainstream and watch maker watches = DOA Sootie Has anyone actually got the update yet though? Mine still hasnt :( boop While my watch hasn't been 'yet another battery headache' it's starting to become 'yet another update headache' and I can't see myself getting another one until they sort that out. JD Eh it's ok Google has More important stuff like April fools gags to work on. mattcoz Yes, because they only have a few developers and can only work on one thing at a time. mattcoz Obviously an issue with the Snapdragon 400, it was already out on the new watches which have the 2100. HD Zen Watch 3? mattcoz What about it? I'm specifically referring to the new watches that launched with Android 2.0 Kyle Gospodnetich ZenWatch 3 isn't here and it's using the 2100, that's what about it. mattcoz I don't know, maybe ASUS is waiting to update all their watches at once. Joshua Hill There's obviously a lot you don't know as it was obvious from the question, even if you didn't previously know, that the zenwatch 3 was a SD 2100 device. mattcoz No shit, I don't work for ASUS. Joshua Hill You really don't know shit lol mattcoz All I can do is speculate, same as any of you. Joshua Hill Then it's not obvious if it's speculation. Only a possibility. mattcoz Ok, fine, poor choice of word, but I still believe it's the simplest and most likely reason. Impulse_Vigil Ehh... I think there's a lot more going on than holdups over specific chipsets, tho that probably played a role. I'm sure certain OEM are updating faces, updating custom apps and hardware drivers (like ASUS' programmable buttons or their and Huawei's speaker)... All of that may have not even started officially until 2.0 was final, after all the beta delays. For some reason I'm a lot more zen (no pun intended) about Wear updates than I'd be about a phone update. Maybe it's the fact that 2.0 itself will screw up as much as it improves (IMO)... Badelhas Why do you say that? Impulse_Vigil Say what? The 2.0 comment? The unbundled notifications are gonna bug the heck out of me until either I learn to keep my notification pane less cluttered (I tend to leave a ton of things there to deal with at the end of the day) or Android O improves overall notification sorting. I don't understand why they simply didn't make it an option one can toggle on/off or why it makes any more sense to do it this way on a cramped watch than it ever did on a phone (where there went the complete opposite way and notifications stack seamlessly as they should IMO). Badelhas But if you swipe left several times there's a "block this app" setting. I have several blocked. Impulse_Vigil How does that solve my notification complaint tho? That's always been a Wear feature (can/could also be set from the Wear app on phone), I *do* want to see most of my notifications on the watch tho, that isn't the issue... I just don't want five separate Gmail notifications and ten different Messages notification simply because I haven't had time to check either on any given day. (same with Calendar, YouTube, and other apps for which multiple notifications per app often pile up on my phone/watch) Scrolling thru all those is gonna be a pain, right now they get neatly bundled or stacked and I can hit the + at the bottom to expand it, and when swiping past I only need do scroll past a single Gmail (or w/e) notification... Why they took this away on 2.0 instead of making it an option is beyond me. The only saving grace here is some of the notification improvements on Android O will alleviate this (channels, being able to snooze notifications, etc). mattcoz Which would explain the Zen Watch 3 not being in this group. Impulse_Vigil Sure, maybe, and/or Huawei holding it up for their original watch even tho it was like *the* beta test device. Joshua Hill If you are only talking about watches that launched with AW 2.0 that is not enough to draw a logical conclusion that the SD 400 is the problem. If you take into account that the vast majority of SD 2100 devices have also been updated then the logical progression starts to make sense. But you must also take into account devices like the zenwatch 3. You didn't even know about it! Joshua Hill Possibly (perhaps even most likely) an issue with the SD400, but not obviously. plaisthos who cares about mainstream. It is a good sign that the non mainstream watches get good update support Milly <-By working on Facebook I'm making $90 to $120 per hour.

I would load the developers version but can not get my computer to recognize my watch. mattcoz The bug was likely introduced since the last preview build. Impulse_Vigil Huawei probably didn't start QC testing on whatever new faces they have until it was final (and they'd be justified)... Not an excuse but as valid an explanation as any. If the update comes out and there's no 2.0 specific faces or features they deserve a roasting tho. NexusMan "But still no mainstream ones." What the hell does that mean? Which Android Wear watches are "mainstream?" Did I miss something? I'd actually argue that the Fossil watches, as well as the Michael Kors and Nixon watches are more "mainstream" than anything from Motorola, LG, and any other tech manufacturer the writer may have had in mind. Joshua Hill You might argue that but you clearly knew what the writer meant. Thus making your question about as ridiculous as you and your post ;) NexusMan For me to "clearly know what the writer meant," would require me to somehow possess some privileged, maybe psychic access to his mind, which I do not. By me using the word "may" as in "may have had in mind," I clearly indicated that I am not totally certain...or clear...as to what he had in mind...or what he meant. Thus making you and your response to my comment as ridiculous as the title to this article. ;) Impulse_Vigil I'd be inclined to agree with ya... I can guess what Richard meant, but mainstream is definitely not the right adjective here. The Fossil watches are about as mainstream as it gets really (for Wear anyway), and I'd be surprised if Huawei actually sold a lot more watches than they did. Popular with enthusiasts != mainstream. I have a Moto and an ASUS btw so I don't have much of a dog in this fight, not in a terrible hurry to get 2.0 and it's unbundled notifications either, tho I'm looking forward to watchfaces being quicker to switch. NexusMan What's the deal with watch faces being quicker to switch? Impulse_Vigil They just are? AFAIK you can have a few preset or favorite'd and just swap from the main face to a different one at any time... Might actually be somewhat useful to have an info-dense face for the workday, a different one for night, etc. At least that's how I interpreted some of the previews and 2.0 reviews, could be mistaken. Right now in order to switch faces you need to long press and swipe around the whole list + redo any customisations, so it's hardly something you'd do on a whim. Don't tell me I'm wrong (jk, do tell), this might be one of the few things I'm looking forward to on 2.0 outside native complications. NexusMan Oh, ok. I'm running 2.0, and you know I never thought about it like that, but yes, you're right. One thing I am not liking with 2.0, however, is storage. I never could figure out why these watches don't come with more storage on board. I like to keep a workout playlist on my watch, and previously, wear music downloads were handled on the phone and it would download all that it safely could, and jus stop. Now, it is handled on the watch itself, and it downloaded until I got a storage is too low and system will malfunction messages. Argh. SO I then had to delete a bunch of watch apps. When even that wasn't good enough, I just had to delete my playlist entirely from the phone (until I have time to create a smaller version of it). Impulse_Vigil That sounds like a drag indeed, another place where Wear 2.0 seemingly went one step forward and two steps back. You generally don't want any flash media anywhere near max capacity, just like hard drives but for different reasons, tho the bottom line is the same... It'll just operate better in the long run with a good 15%+ free, so it's probably best to account for that if you need to manage it manually. NAND storage controllers need some space to manage pages and let wear leveling algorithms do their thing (in addition to standard TRIM or garbage collection commands)… Even if you never reshuffle that playlist the OS writes a little bit to storage every day/hour or just edits existing data. Seems like a bunch of things in 2.0 were tweaked with the idea of making the watches much more independent, but I doubt the majority of the market for them will ever be in people wanting to use LTE watches sans phone.

Some work for legislatures. Others work in agencies or for councils. Many work for non-governmental organisations and think tanks. This policy tribe, made up of people of all political persuasions, conform to some clear norms. They make proposals and arguments forged to convince those in power that their positions are disinterested, are based on empirically sound studies, would benefit more people than they would harm, and would serve the greater good over the long term. Even if a policy worker makes such an argument disingenuously, she or he conforms to these cultural expectations. That’s why the Federal Communication Commission studied the issue of online privacy for years, solicited public comment, deliberated openly, and ruled in 2016 that telecommunication and cable companies must not exploit the intimate relationships that consumers have with their phones and computers. This was a serious policy process. The commission considered measured arguments for and against the rules for harvesting, using, and selling personal records of how we use the internet. And experts working for the FCC weighed in with their informed opinions before the rule was approved last October. Republicans in Senate and then House did the opposite this past week, voting along party lines to reverse the consumer protections. Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, and other companies have long wished to leverage personal data, seeing Google and Facebook making billions from it through customised advertising revenue. Most web sites, including Bloomberg.com, track web use in order to deliver relevant advertisements to users. New administration The ISPs could not win a policy argument before the FCC, but Congress was willing to act quickly amid the flurry of big issues confronting the public in the first 100 days of the new administration. Once President Trump signs this bill into law, as he has pledged to do as part of his assault on Obama-era regulation regardless of their value, these telecommunication companies will be able to monitor all sorts of data use and cross-reference it with a user’s location, the time of day, and even the concentration of other service users. As more commerce occurs through phones, these companies could launch payment applications that muscle out similar services from Apple or Google. That kind of consumer data is especially valuable. Then, telecommunication companies could sell ads on the locked or home screen of a phone — something even Google and Facebook can’t do. Beyond that, US Congress is also removing regulations that made telecommunication companies responsible for the leads of valuable — and possibly dangerous — private information through security breaches. There is a weak argument that posits that by stripping these consumer protections from telecommunication companies Congress is levelling the competitive field between Verizon and Facebook. But such levelling need not occur on the backs of consumers. A better move, and one that would have to occur in concert with careful study and public deliberation by Congress, the FCC, and the Federal Trade Commission, would further limit how companies like Facebook and Google collect, store, and use consumer-generated information. But for the next four years we are unlikely to see any of these institutions take the interests of the public seriously. The best we can hope for out of this move is that Americans of all political persuasions move consumer protection, especially privacy, up in their list of concerns. While polls consistently show that Americans care about the issue — a Pew survey from 2015 showed that 93 per cent of American adults say that being in control of who can get information about them is important — almost no one votes based on how a legislator or president protected privacy. Surveillance Already we have seen commenters on Breitbart voice anger that Congress is pandering to anti-privacy lobbyists. Concern over possible federal warrantless surveillance of Trump associates and their dealings with major figures in Russia should generate privacy concerns among Trump critics as well as supporters. And Comcast remains one of most hated companies in America, down on the list with Goldman Sachs, Koch Industries, and BP. A popular movement for privacy protection is possible — and hopefully it gains strength before a major privacy meltdown. However, American businesses and consumers will never enjoy stability and security until Washington rediscovers respect for policymakers and policy processes. Serious people should study these issues, construct proposals that take all stakeholders into account, introduce them carefully, assess their effects, and argue honestly about the best ways forward. Such habits remind us that we live in a country that takes the fate of its citizens seriously. I know, it seems an impossible dream. But it’s something we benefited from just a few months ago.

Newswise — SAN FRANCISCO, April 2, 2017 — Pollution created by making and dyeing clothes has pitted the fashion industry and environmentalists against each other. Now, the advent of “fast fashion” — trendy clothing affordable enough to be disposable — has strained that relationship even more. But what if we could recycle clothes like we recycle paper, or even upcycle them? Scientists report today new progress toward that goal. The team will present the work at the 253rd National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS). ACS, the world’s largest scientific society, is holding the meeting here through Thursday. It features more than 14,000 presentations on a wide range of science topics. “People don’t want to spend much money on textiles anymore, but poor-quality garments don’t last,” Simone Haslinger explains. “A small amount might be recycled as cleaning rags, but the rest ends up in landfills, where it degrades and releases carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas. Also, there isn’t much arable land anymore for cotton fields, as we also have to produce food for a growing population.” All these reasons amount to a big incentive to recycle clothing, and some efforts are already underway, such as take-back programs. But even industry representatives admit in news reports that only a small percentage gets recycled. Other initiatives shred used clothing and incorporate the fibers into carpets or other products. But Haslinger, a doctoral candidate at Aalto University in Finland, notes that this approach isn’t ideal since the carpets will ultimately end up in landfills, too. A better strategy, says Herbert Sixta, Ph.D., who heads the biorefineries research group at Aalto University, is to upcycle worn-out garments: “We want to not only recycle garments, but we want to really produce the best possible textiles, so that recycled fibers are even better than native fibers.” But achieving this goal isn’t simple. Cotton and other fibers are often blended with polyester in fabrics such as “cotton-polyester blends,” which complicates processing. Previous research showed that many ionic liquids can dissolve cellulose. But the resulting material couldn’t then be re-used to make new fibers. Then about five years ago, Sixta’s team found an ionic liquid — 1,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene acetate — that could dissolve cellulose from wood pulp, producing a material that could be spun into fibers. Later testing showed that these fibers are stronger than commercially available viscose and feel similar to lyocell. Lyocell is also known by the brand name Tencel, which is a fiber favored by eco-conscious designers because it’s made of wood pulp. Building on this process, the researchers wanted to see if they could apply the same ionic liquid to cotton-polyester blends. In this case, the different properties of polyester and cellulose worked in their favor, Haslinger says. They were able to dissolve the cotton into a cellulose solution without affecting the polyester. “I could filter the polyester out after the cotton had dissolved,” Haslinger says. “Then it was possible without any more processing steps to spin fibers out of the cellulose solution, which could then be used to make clothes.” To move their method closer to commercialization, Sixta’s team is testing whether the recovered polyester can also be spun back into usable fibers. In addition, the researchers are working to scale up the whole process and are investigating how to reuse dyes from discarded clothing. But, Sixta notes, after a certain point, commercializing the process doesn’t just require chemical know-how. “We can handle the science, but we might not know what dye was used, for example, because it’s not labeled,” he says. “You can’t just feed all the material into the same process. Industry and policymakers have to work on the logistics. With all the rubbish piling up, it is in everyone’s best interest to find a solution.” The researchers received funding support from the European Union’s Trash-2-Cash project and the Finnish government. The American Chemical Society is a nonprofit organization chartered by the U.S. Congress. With nearly 157,000 members, ACS is the world’s largest scientific society and a global leader in providing access to chemistry-related research through its multiple databases, peer-reviewed journals and scientific conferences. ACS does not conduct research, but publishes and publicizes peer-reviewed scientific studies. Its main offices are in Washington, D.C., and Columbus, Ohio.

The spread of urban areas and consequences of global warming simultaneously decrease the area of arable land.1 Cotton industry will consequently compete for acreage with food and biofuels.2 The creation of a circular economy therefore seems indispensable. Currently, the lack of adequate recycling strategies prevents the usage of worn out textiles as a source of raw material for new value added products.3 Textiles on the market represent almost exclusively multi-component garments with cotton polyester blends being the most prominent mixture, which poses severe challenges onto their recycling due to their inherent heterogeneity.4 Recently developed recycling strategies propose the dissolution of the cellulosic component in N-methylmorpholine N-oxide5,6 or imidazolium derived ionic liquids.7,8 Although these approaches suggest subsequent fiber spinning, they fail to demonstrate the feasibility of the concept. The process presented herein aims to overcome these weaknesses in state-of-the-art methodologies. A superbase-derived ionic liquid dissolves the cotton component selectively without any significant degradation of the residual polyester. After filtration, the cellulose solution is subjected to dry-jet wet spinning to obtain Lyocell-type fibers, while the recovered polyester can be fed back to conventional industrial processes such as melt spinning. The ionic liquid is regained by thin film evaporation. 1 Hämmerle, F. M. Lenzinger Berichte 2011, 89, 12-21. 2 The Fiber Year 2015. 3 Briga-sà, A.; D. Nascimento; N. Teixeira; J. Pinto; F.

A new Pixel Launcher design is showing up for some users Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/03/29 8:48am PDTMar 29, 2017 119 Plus 1 on G+ 262 Share on Facebook 73 Share on Twitter Total Shares454 Google News One of the few differences between the Pixel Launcher and the Google Now Launcher is how you search. The GNL has a search bar spanning the full width of the first home screen, while the Pixel Launcher has a simple Google button that starts a search. Now that appears to be changing, at least for some users.   Left: Current design; Right: New design The new layout brings back the search bar, but also removes the weather/time information (perhaps this will be added back in at some point). I personally prefer the existing Pixel Launcher design, but that's just me. If you want to try it for yourself, some users have reported that clearing App data for the Pixel Launcher causes a switch to the new design, but keep in mind, this will also wipe your home screen layouts.

Phoenix Nice, it seems like they are going all in on the implementation of other launchers features Nick The weather widget is one of my favorite parts about the Pixel launcher, is that still included? makeitra1n Read the whole article pls... Nick Sorry, AP must have clarified it later or I must have missed it. Jean I've literally never been able to get the weather to work. Mine looks like the left picture which has the time but no weather info. NepgearGo You need to give it location permission Jean I've tried it all...Scoured forums for solutions. Nothing works. mcd78 I opened up weather inside google assistant and added it to the homescreen. It created a new weather shortcut with a custom icon and functions like the old widget. Still would rather the old design back. wire141 Customize>Everything else>Continue to get weather updates. Toggle that off and on. Only thing that has worked for me a couple times. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e818a741b6cb69d6467fb8e412a71c768c1c675fedc1d1a67588388865ca4308.png Jean Done this as well, just have the clock on my home screen with no weather. Weather shows up in "google now." I just added the weather app to my home screen so I can see weather quickly. G-man Go to Google now settings>feeds then disable feeds and delete preferences. The re-enable the feed. Should work now. Jean Holy [email protected] ! That actually worked. Thanks! chromaniac For a second I thought Evie. Ananda Krishna Me too. just replace that G logo with Search text, you got Evie Sergio App update require or pushed on server side? MJ The fact only some users are reporting it or the last paragraph in the article doesn't give you clue? It's server side... Sergio There's no need to be so harsh, but thanks. Dom Apice He can't help it, he comments on every single article and is rude every time. MJ I always thought a search button you need to swipe, hide search or made it more confusing for the average user. Everyone knows what a search bar is... The same thing for the new app drawer which is less obvious and how swiping is easier than a touch button is beyond me. Sruly J Agreed. I shudder to think about how many people will be confused when they don't see an app drawer button on their phone (at least out of the box, although a lot of people won't know that there's an option to enable an app drawer button if such an option exists). Frisi No dice here. Just "new design" Kakairo I hope it's just an option, I like the weather widget. Flyboy Pc Its not an option..Now i couldn't get back old pill widget Jeviel Crespo Just go in apps and enable the pixel launcher permissions again. It's not a redesign. It's a lack of permissions caused by clearing the app data Régis Knechtel https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/adfdfc99dac5efbe93ffa729e71171a36f068c67367415f45a9f5c03071f1026.gif Arthur Numeriano My reaction exactly. bjorg18 lol Lord Argyris This all fits. My first thoughts when I saw the new search bar were "do not want" and the recollection that Apple once had rounded search widgets in OS X (pre-Yosemite, that is). This primate is just putting both those thoughts together for me. True Radiant Free Don't know what you're talking about, but the old design Pixel launcher looks more like Apple (iOS) than anything Google has ever done with Android. Bikram Agarwal ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fa35aff3fd94527ed963eddc552d9b838f5580d8f427d64f8374fe3b6b0d8329.gif merman1983 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/029c8691eb0ee1d3355b676112b3e9325c21f629f6a2525d63f6ff7c832f3c2a.gif kjohnson04 Anna Akana? merman1983 Oh yeah I think so. It's from Wrestling isn't Wrestling https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYvMOf3hsGA Dom Apice Why does that person have the old icons for phone and messaging.... Kieron Quinn It looks like a device that's just been reset (which is probably why they got the design), and is downloading updates OligarchyAmbulance It's also using a non-default DPI. Kawshik Ahmed The newly announced Samsung Galaxy S8 already using this new Google widget. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b32142c2d0e3112fb3fb54cf56dc500e9b62726fdf3e288265fa88c8333198a9.jpg Artem Russakovskii It's not the same, considering the position, the mic button, and the fact that Samsung doesn't use the Pixel Launcher. Kelderic Similar design, but not the same widget. It's the default TouchWiz launcher in your picture. Winston U G L Y Winston And my only issue with the old design was there was no voice key. If they're going to elongate it, might as well have it back. Travis White You do know you can hold the home button (bottom center) to launch voice controlled search right? Miles Reiter True, but I'd add that there are a couple of usability gaps in Google Assistant compared to a normal voice search. For instance for some unknown and likely ridiculous reason, Assistant can't identify songs as of yet, while normal voice search allows for that. Travis White Touché. I have yet to try using voice to identify music (usually it's too loud to activate via voice). But I do agree it's unusual that they don't have the same functions. My current favorite is depending on how I ask to reply to a message in Android auto it will either allow me to, or say "I'm sorry, but I do not have the capability to read text messages yet" Aditya Just go to widgets, search for Google app and there should be a Sound search widget. Place it on your home screen, click and it starts to listen. Ez! Miles Reiter Oh yeah, I have a swipe action rigged up in Nova that pulls up the search bar (including the mic). I'm just commenting on how it's bizarre that Google has launched their assistant without all of the functionality ported over. It's poor UX, people shouldn't have to find workarounds. Winston Holding down something has never been terribly fast. Tap has always been the way to go. Travis White I feel like the worry of an additional half second of time might be a bit of a low priority to fix. However, noting both methods do not have the same functionality is a bigger issue. Kyle Salewski Yeah, I really miss the Voice key and there isn't even a widget for it. Assistant just doesn't cut it at the moment. No song recognition, no navigate to 'person's name', even quick google searches are cumbersome with the Assistant :-/ quick Exactly!!!!!! When you have a google home, and want to set a reminder, you need to do it through your phone... One tap to open the voice/assistant on your phone is way better than holding down home or tapping twice. Especially when your hands are full, or your hands are full of construction crap, or food etc that you don't want to get all over your phone. Bewear WHY. Pilz I have the new one it's awful. Saiful98 How do you get it....is it just clear the app data? nxtiak w.t.f. Booyabobby If this change comes to all Pixels then i will finally cave to installing Nova Launcher again. Rann Xeroxx I would hope the Pixel is Google's standard bearer devices to showcase pure Android. Instead its starting to look like a Samsung one with non-standard crap and junk. People already have a hard time moving from one Android phone to another because the GUI is so different. RenatoFontesTapia Agree that it looks like non-standard crap and junk. Disagree on people having a hard time moving from one phone to another... they are different but not THAT different :P alfreduran OMG, really? Lmao!😂 NoNotTellingYou Yet another argument for Nova Launcher. Anthony Is the weather frog still available? Jesse Lee An overlooked comment, love it! Lord Argyris Nova will protect me. Kevin Davis I prefer the current design. I don't look forward to this, if it's forced upon us. Cesar Cardoso This new design looks suspiciously close to the Pixel Launcher-esque Launcher3 that is showing up on Android One and Nokia phones and Moto G5/G5 Plus... Badouken I actually don't mind it. I'm sure Nova will add it and if I don't like it I can disable it! Himesh Jain The Middle ground may be reached this way Sorry, if anyone gets triggered by my poor mockup in MS Paint :D Drakenoid I am guessing you're trying to post your mockup from reddit, but I can't see it. Himesh Jain Oops, Fixed... I think I removed the link thinking Disqus already loaded it Trooper311 Why Google why? Ygor Cortes They ditched the weather info. Google, what's your problem? Berkay ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Justin Martin I just Factory reset my Pixel, and sure enough, new search bar. Mohamed Hani Bioud Factory reset? Can i see version of your google launcher? Justin Martin https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8ac0229de2f247592029c796579d2993ddb7d8d17234a1b17a7385fbf0ee5a17.png Frisi I have a dif version. I have 7.1.1-3624681 Play Store doesn't show any updates nor I have the new search bar. Frisi Odd, I went to apk mirror to install your version and it says it cannot install it. Peter You can't install an older version over a newer one. sebastianer They google now launchered the situation Mochen Liu And pls also put the microphone button back to the right of that bar pls... DotSlashAttack Long press the home button. Mohamed Hani Bioud You have it? DotSlashAttack Have what? ShirtShanks The goods, dude. DotSlashAttack I have many good. What will you like for buy? Mochen Liu The microphone is Google Now. For now, they are still two different things. Not quite different tho, but still .... dcdttu Ugly G tab swipe thing gone, yay! Weather widget and functionality of old launcher gone, boo. bL4Ck >smaller icons please no Frisi The dpi was changed. Miloš Ognjanović I just saw strange new search icon when adding google search widget... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9c45b08dbecbaa62a81d9130cff6b37732cd80216fd29cc0095614165e73e09a.png ast00 There is 1 thing that makes me like this more than the old one. It looks normal. With the old one, you have a pill in a bright white, then a random box in a less bright white that expands it to the edge. How about simply making the pill reach and overflow the edge? Is that too much to ask for? b_boogey_xl I don't even have it yet but I'm about to "send feedback" Jordan L all this did was take away the weather info. thanks google. WTF. elongated search bar is not more useful than than the little one. press a finger it, then type. same for both. I bet their usage stats showed that people weren't using the search button, so they are making it a bar again. iluvthesoftsoft Just go Nova. You decide, not google. Ramos Roger Don't fucking tell me what to do, I decide Derek J Dambrosio This happened to me after I was forced to do a factory reset because I restarted my phone during the last update. I like the old look better, can I get it back? Badouken Nova Launcher lets you select it but if you want to just use the Pixel launcher then no. Diipo Owotumi (El Clarividente I had the same issue. I had up go to apps and clear data and cache in the pixel launcher to get the old look back. I did lose all my folders but I'm happier. Derek J Dambrosio Thank you Diipo, I cleared the data and it's back! brkshr Apparently I'm in the minority hating the G/search logo on the upper left corner. I have to use 2 hands to get to it and it annoys the hell out of me. I would rather have a full bar, or be able to reverse sides for the search and weather/date permawidget. boop Neat. I'll miss the weather but I'm not a fan of the pill. edit: Tried it, didn't work :( Ryan Johnson Honestly, I think this is leagues better than the awful pill the Pixel Launcher currently sports WORPspeed I'm torn...I hate the pill, but like the weather widget. Then again I'm using neither right now :P Sean Thomas that looks....weird. I would expect some kind of "search Google" or something hint text. Or a microphone on the right. It's so empty? Kodos Otro Please, please, kill the Material Design. Peter I'm not convinced this isn't just a bug. Possibly due to a fail in the Google App which provides some of the resources which Pixel Launcher uses. Diipo Owotumi (El Clarividente Exactly. I called Google and the support guy said it was a bug. vmxr remove that search bar already !! Ernie Stupid question. Will my Pixel launcher get the update on my Nexus 6p? Flyboy Pc Just now i got this widget..Its really annoying and I couldnt get the old pill widget even after installing old versions of pixel launcher Flyboy Pc https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/070d3664bad3be75afd09aa51df864df8e41041d04b89928b9275149a0a735b7.png Its really annoying Justin Martin Why is no one else reporting on this? DiscoMilf >8:01 Russ d’Sa Just got the new Pixel Launcher...er...wait a minute...🤔 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/34af7f7951baa149a775eaebba3605ac7e8cff123e151ddbf31a2c2110ba99af.png DragoCubed What launcher is that? Raphael Duran What's that search widget? yoloswag Maybe they should switch the weather and G widgets because top left is very far to reach. fonix232 A better design would be sticking with the existing one, and having the G-pill slide the search bar in (and at the same time, load GNow cards from the bottom, so it's consistent). PromethianKnight Thank god for Nova Launcher... 😂😂 Matthew I have this hideous thing sitting on my home screen as well. Did a system reset last night and when I checked back after everything had been downloaded/updated, I was stuck with the same bar. Chuck Albaugh ABSOLUTELY HATE IT dragonfire6209 Please God no. Rounded icons may be fine but WTH with that search box?! Kelderic Eh, I don't like the rounded icons. I like the 6.0 era icons best. I think going to circular makes it harder to quickly distinguish differences. Justin Martin https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9a545da95c0a5d7e7319a634bb0361c0aecd654f2f866bcad132509aab63a6c3.png Justin Martin https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/aade1b458374d877b8457beefed645a7c14c43dda5504870f38b36114624d2e4.png Okay, so if you wipe app data in the Pixel Launcher, it will go back to the old pill disgrassa Which widget is this? Justin Martin Read the article disgrassa I mean the weather widget, is it native to this new version of the pixel launcher? Justin Martin Oh, No sorry, that is weather timeline. Kelderic I think Google has kinda run out of design things to do. Material design in Android 5.0 made things really good, and the evolutions in 6 and 7 just tweaked and slightly improved it. But this change in the launcher is just treading water. My Google Now launcher has a full width search bar. That changed to the Google Logo in the Pixel Launcher. And now it's back to the search bar? Back and forth we go. Justin Martin I wish we could download the GNL, and run it native on the Pixel. Kelderic The Pixel can't run Now Launcher??? Justin Martin Not native...no dirtyjudo No. Bane✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I had come to like the weather and date. I wish Google would make up its mind. They are like kids with the worst case of A.D.D. on record. I just use nova launcher anyway. Pixel launcher is basically useless to me without double-tap-to-sleep. terry I like the pill and the weather on my home screen. I have seen G8 pics and it has the old search bar. I don't like it. I am thinking about getting a S8+. But go to pixel launcher and get back my current homepage. Steve Belzer Do not want! What a waste of space. I instantly loved the Pixel's new home screen layout, as I've always ditched the search bar for weather widgets on my previous Android phones. Why do I need a whole bar when the Google chrome icon can serve basically the same function? Diipo Owotumi (El Clarividente This is a backward step in my opinion. If this becomes compulsory, I'll happily move back to Nova launcher. Jeviel Crespo This is not a redesign. If you clear the app data, it clears its permissions. Simply enable the app permissions again and you'll see the weather widget come right back Justin Martin I did another factory reset and the weather widget stayed this time. I checked permissions, and they are cleared. I think there is more to it. I too think it's nothing but a bug though. Jeviel Crespo I see. I seem to be able to get rid of the weather widget at will, simply by disabling permissions , and get it back by enabling them again Justin Martin In the pixel launcher, or the Google app? Jeviel Crespo The pixel launcher Jeviel Crespo The pixel launcher Bazar6 That's not cool. I'll likely go back to Action Launcher and put a weather widget where Pixel used to have it. I love the Weather and have gotten too used to unlocking my phone just glance at that very spot.
