You can now install Google Assistant for iPhone and get some of the Assistant features on your iPhone, adding to the voice control options on your iPhone. Here’s a rundown of what you need to know about Google Assistant for iPhone including what it is, what it can do and why it wants your permission to access some iPhone features. What is Google Assistant for iPhone? This is Google Assistant for iPhone. Google Assistant for iPhone is a voice assistant, like Siri, that you can use to control your phone, smart home, listen to music, open apps and more. You can use your voice, or you can type a message when you cannot tap on the screen. It’s a fairly simple way to control your devices and your iPhone. Download Google Assistant for iPhone free from the App Store and connect with a Gmail account to get started. What Can Google Assistant Do? You can use Google Assistant like Siri to do a number of tasks. There are some additional integrations and features that Google Assistant offers over Siri. Here are some of the things you can do with Google Assistant for iPhone. Set a Reminder Set a Reminder based on a Location Play Music from Apple Music or YouTube Check the local weather Check the weather in a specific city Place a phone call Open an app on your iPhone Set a timer Check sports news Check sports facts Play a game Play a trivia game Flip a coin Find out what sound an animal makes Find out when sunrise is Get answers to questions Start directions to a place Hear the latest news Get the definition of a work Check the status of a flight Find out what a flight costs Find places nearby Check nutrition information Find your next meeting Find your next flight Translate words and voices Remind yourself where your car is parked Search Google Use it as a calculator Check stock prices Perform conversions Open an App There are many other things you can do with Google Assistant and Google is constantly adding features. We expect that you will see more options added on a regular basis. What Can’t Google Assistant Do? There are some things Google Assistant can’t do. Google Assistant is very powerful on Android phones and on Google Home. You can’t do all the same things with Google Assistant for iPhone. Specifically, you cannot use Google Assistant for iPhone to play Spotify music. This doesn’t work at all, your only options are Apple Music and Youtube. This is likely due to Apple’s edict to not allow voice control of any competing music service. There is no way to Cast a song or a video to a Chromecast, at least not that we could make work. Why Does Google Assistant Need Access to So Much? When you install Google Assistant to for iPhone you will see prompts to connect your Gmail account, allow access to your microphone and to your location. Google uses your Gmail account to connect with your searches and information in your emails to show you when trips are coming up and other information. The app uses your iPhone location to know where you are when you ask about the weather, a local restaurant or for a reminder based on a location. Google Assistant wants access to your microphone so you ask the app to do things and search for you. How to Use Google Assistant Without Touching Your iPhone One of the challenges with any Siri alternative is that you cannot use a button on the phone to access it. You can’t hold the home button on your iPhone to use Google Assistant, but you can use a convoluted command to open Google Assistant for iPhone and then search and more. Say “Hey Siri open Assistant.” When Assistant opens, you can say “OK Google”, and then your command. This allows you to use Google Assistant without manually opening the app or touching your phone. One Response 05/22/2017 Franks Ross Reply I have installed Google Assistant for iPhone and using some of the features. They are useful for everyday use. Google Assistant surely makes many of your everyday tasks easier and faster. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published. Comment Name* Email* Website

Editorial: Assistant is the key to Google's Android Automotive project Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/22 10:46am PDTMay 22, 2017 8 Plus 1 on G+ 28 Share on Facebook 45 Share on Twitter Total Shares81 Android OS News Videos Google spent much of the I/O 2017 keynote talking about machine learning. In fact, we heard the phrase "AI first" as a description of Google's current plans. You probably have a little sliver of Google's AI capabilities in your pocket right now—Google Assistant. There's one place in particular Google really wants Assistant to live, and that's in your car. Voice commands in general are extremely well-suited to the car, so it should come as no surprise that Google had two Assistant-infused "Android Automotive" demos on-hand at I/O—one from Volvo (above) and another from Audi. It's more clear now than ever that Google wants to be the smart interface for your car, and it plans to do it with Assistant. Your car with Android The Android Automotive project (just an internal name for now) was rumored in 2016, and the first demo of such a system was showcased at CES early this year. This is distinct from Android Auto, which Google released alongside Lollipop. However, it took several months before the first aftermarket head units and new cars arrived with support for the platform. Progress on Auto has been slow ever since. It does barely anything now that it couldn't do at launch. Perhaps that's because Google is currently more interested in making Android the car's operating system. With Android Auto, your phone simply projects an interface to the car's display, but Android Automotive is a car that actually runs Android as its infotainment system. There have been cars running Android before—many Honda and Hyundai vehicles still do, actually. They're very old builds that are almost completely unrecognizable as Android, though. By working with automakers, Google can make the interface more modern and get its services embedded in the car. The two Android Automotive concepts being demoed at I/O were surprisingly full-featured. Check out our video from the event if you want to see how Android in the car actually works. One of the first things you'll notice about this new take on Android in the car is that it's fast... well, faster than Android Auto. Android Auto tends to lag heavily at times for no discernible reason. The fact that it's still preferable to the stock in-car software is a testament to how little automakers have innovated in this space. The two interfaces demoed were also very different from each other, indicating Google might give automakers even more freedom to modify Android than phone OEMs do. Actually, the Volvo interface was visually similar to Volvo's current software (which is not Nougat, obviously). Both demos were based on Android 7.0 with an eye toward migrating to Android O when it's final. Importantly, Android Automotive runs Google services and Android apps without connecting an Android phone. The apps are essentially the same as the ones you currently use in Android Auto. They're limited to audio and messaging apps, and you do have to wonder how long those apps and services will be up to date. Phone updates can take ages, and cars could be much worse. Assistant everywhere An often expressed fear is that a car with Android-based infotainment features will eventually become extremely outdated. After all, you keep a car much longer than you do a phone. Will the apps and services running on that car ever be updated? Will developers eventually drop support for in-car apps on these older versions of Android? There are a lot of unknowns right now. Audi's Demo Googlers seem to have a go-to line when you ask about updates to Android-infused cars—they talk about Project Treble. Google is cognizant of the fact that automakers seldom update the software on cars, but the hope is that updates will still happen occasionally if Google can make it easier. There's also a lot of talk about Assistant in the car, and I had several Googlers cite this as a way to make apps and services more accessible while you're driving regardless of what version of Android your car runs. Apps installed in the car might not be updated very quickly (or at all), but that's not a concern in the cloud. After connecting an app or service to Assistant, it's accessible from your phone, a Google Home, Android Auto, or even a car running Android that hasn't seen an update lately. Thus, developers don't necessarily have to worry about specifically supporting old versions of Android in the car, they simply need to take advantage of Assistant. You can do things with Assistant voice commands that are very much outside the bounds of road-safe media and messaging apps. Assistant's smarter voice commands have the potential to be extremely useful while you're driving. There was a wall of smart home devices next to the Volvo car in order to demonstrate how you could adjust your humble abode in advance of your arrival. Hot day? Crank the AC before you roll into the driveway. You also have more control over the car with Assistant as part of the car's OS—for instance, you could control the climate or open the sunroof, which isn't feasible in Android Auto. Having Assistant built into the car also means more people will use it. Even iOS users who don't have an Android phone to plug in will be able to use Assistant in these vehicles, and that gets them into the Google ecosystem. Assistant is very much hit or miss right now. Sometimes you ask Assistant a question or issue a command only to be greeted with a cloyingly polite apology. Still, it's getting better, and some of the things Google demoed could be great experiences. Regardless of possible update issues down the road, Google's involvement with car infotainment will lead to more modern versions of Android at launch, and Assistant could help your car's software remain useful.

At least for me. Impatiently waiting... ShahinTr All we need is our Assistant to be voiced as Kitt. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7d287ac75059f48cc9bac82680837bc707448769b35d9a2c20ef2af572856780.jpg JG That would be awesome... A customized "Hey KITT" trigger phase would be great to, though doubtful they'd ever make one without Google in it. Daniel Actually, now that we have an SDK for Google Assistant, I'm pretty sure that's very close to happening. Leon I'd also settle for Majel Barrett. Drinster I think the UI looks terrible the demo from last year in the Maserati looks way more better. Rawhi Mohammad SEXXXXXXY I WANT IT.. #APKPLZ xfullmetal17 Because the OEMs hadn't gotten their fingers all over the UI in the Maserati last year. iampwd One thing is for sure, I want that car. Oleg Vorkunov Google now worked much better than assistant. Now I want to throw my watch and phone away. leganzish Android Auto is as good as dead. It barely got more functional since its introduction and will only languish more now that Google has moved on. The thing I don't like is the car being data independent. That's the beauty of the "projection" method of Android Auto. I don't want to live in a future where I have a data connection for my phone, my tablet, my watch, my car, my refrigerator, my washer, and my dryer. I want a data connection for my phone and everything else to be able to piggy-back off of that. whispy_snippet I really doubt it's dead. What about the millions of people who don't intend to buy a car for years or have just bought a car with Android Auto? The majority of people sit in this category. Sure, "Automotive" is probably the future. But I think Android Auto has plenty more to come. leganzish I'm not saying its going to disappear of the face of the earth tomorrow. Just that it will languish. It has already had fairly slow adoption. I would expect adoption rates to slow now that Google has tipped their hand on the next automotive initiative. If consumers get frustrated at the Hangouts situation, I think the very careful/conservative (when it comes to tech progress) automotive brands will be extremely hesitant to invest in Android Auto when it appears to have fallen out of Google's favor. whispy_snippet Hmmm I'm still not convinced. For one, getting car makers to adopt Android Auto has been challenging enough. Convincing hundreds of car makers to suddenly drop their existing operating systems and hand full control to Google is going to take a lot of persuasion and a lot of time. In the short to mid term it's going to be easier to convince car makers to offer a "plug and play" connectivity feature that consumers demand, without the need to cede full control to Google. Remember, a lot of people use iPhones and will demand Apple CarPlay in their next vehicle. Do you think Apple is going to develop a CarPlay app for Android Automotive? I've no doubt Android Automotive is what Google sees as the end goal. But developing a full featured car OS from the ground up, for every single car maker, is an enormous task. In the meantime there are millions and millions of car owners out there with no intention of buying a new vehicle for years. Google has recognised this and its why Android Auto can now run as a stand alone app on phones. And because this app can run on millions of phones, it offers developers plenty of incentive to support it (and thus support Android Auto as a platform broadly). Filipe Santos Car Assistant first, Waze last JasonIvers Android Automotive is still better than some proprietary junk infotainment system from a car manufacturer, even if it's never updated at all. At least you have a reasonably good chance third-party developers will actually build something for it without having to be paid to do so. whispy_snippet My biggest worry about our new world of connected cars is security. Just wait until someone hacks a vehicle's control inputs and causes a crash. What are Google, Apple, car manufacturers, etc going to do about this looming question? abqnm I think that would come down to car manufacturers hardening and isolating essential control systems so they can't be accessed in the event the infotainment system is hacked and somehow allows access to the CAN-BUS. Still, even with access to CAN-BUS, proprietary software over encrypted connections is generally required to access control systems. So it's not like someone can just hack the infotainment system and suddenly can control your steering remotely. There would be a massive amount of protocol reverse-engineering work needed, and it would be on a per-model, per-software build, per-control surface basis. The Jeep exploit that was demoed a couple years back required them to reverse engineer and spend many hundreds of hours to do so. It's a concern, sure, but not a major one. whispy_snippet If a car being hacked could result in someone's death then I would consider it a major concern. The reputation of connected cars and their associated manufacturers and developers are at stake. Just one death as a result of a car being hacked could ripple through the media and cause millions to question the safety of something like Android Automotive. I obviously don't understand how one would hack a car and I'm sure it's ridiculously complex. But if it's possible, I really hope the companies that have our lives in their hands are doing everything they can to mitigate a disaster. It might sound dramatic, but I think it's really important to keep asking these questions. Software exploits are rare, but every now and again we see even the big companies drop the ball (Apple with its iCloud brute force hack, Google with its Google Docs exploit, Microsoft and the ransomware attack). If computers and software are vulnerable, that makes cars with computers and software vulnerable. And when you're hurtling along at 60mph that's well worth our concern. abqnm Since it relies on assistant, does that mean that all cars must now have a data connection? Does or can it use the phone's data connection? There was no indication of connection sharing in the Volvo demo. I really don't want to see cars that I have to pay a monthly subscription fee for a data connection just to be able to tell it to turn off my seat heater. RyanWhitwam The demo cars both had dedicated LTE. That's the way it works right now. Presumably, it would be possible to share the data connection, but that would be up to automakers. whispy_snippet Surely a wireless charging pad with NFC that triggers a WiFi tether arrangement makes sense. Every phone in the near future and onward is going to have wireless charging - we just need an agreed standard of course... ekngee i think Android Automotive is more of a motive-ational push to say "hey, it's easy to use Android to build your infotainment system, rather than do your own from scratch". Android Auto should still stay, because as stated, updates are a big unknown, so i'd rather be safe updating my phone than the car. SAM Few years down the road, people will be talking about android fragmentation on cars, how only 1% of cars are on latest Android version and Android O still wont die.

Humanity’s mission falls on the shoulders of 19-year-old Ke Jie, the world’s top player of Go, also known as weiqi (圍棋), while the computer will be Google DeepMind’s AlphaGo, arguably the smartest of its kind. At stake is the boundary where artificial intelligence and machine learning can surpass human endeavour, especially in strategies, plotting and the element of surprise. “Most people view this as man versus machine, while I disagree,” said DeepMind’s founder and CEO Demis Hassabis at the kickoff of the tournament in Wuzhen. “It is more like men using them as tools to discover new knowledge together.” A two-person strategy game on a 19 X 19 grid board with black and white stones, weiqi is the most complex competition played by humans, with more possible moves and permutations than the total number of estimated atoms in the visible universe. The game has been the benchmark for measuring the encroachment by artificial intelligence on human ingenuity for decades, even since IBM’s DeepBlue defeated the chess master Gary Kasparov in 1997. Unlike previous computing attempts, AlphaGo uses two different neural network “brains” that cooperate to choose its moves. In 2016, AlphaGo dispatched South Korean grand master Lee Sedol, the then reigning world champion, in a 4-1 match. The odds are stacked against Ke, who had already been vanquished by AlphaGo during an online match in January. There was “only a slight chance” for Ke to prevail, said Zheng Hong, a ninth-dan master, at the match. “Artificial intelligence can keep improving on itself by playing millions of games against itself,” Zheng said. “It will not be the end of the world if AlphaGo wins. No man can outrun a car, but it still means a lot to get an Olympic medal as the fastest running human.” The match is an important marker for technology companies like Google, Uber Technologies, Alibaba Group and China’s dominant search engine operator Baidu Inc, which are all making artificial intelligence (AI) their next frontier for innovation. The applications for AI range from voice recognition in iPhone’s Siri to facial recognition in AliPay’s online payment system to Tesla Motor’s autonomous driving. The application of AI can help humans find solutions to problems they can’t even begin to consider, Hassabis said. “By collaborating with scientists, we believe AI will help create new sources of ideas to solve real-world problems,” he said, adding the technology behind AlphaGo has already helped to reduce the energy used in Googe’s data centre by 40 per cent. A match in China is ripe with symbolisms, where the Chinese have considered mastery of the game one of the four essential marks of the aristocratic and scholarly classes. Weiqi was recorded to have been first played some time before the Zhou dynasty of 1,046 to 256 BC. It later spread to the Korean peninsula and Japan, where it’s also widely played and has been formalised since the 15th century as the modern version known as Go. Wuzhen, a town of 60,000 inhabitants in eastern China’s Zhejiang province, is where China has been holding the World Internet Conference since 2014, from which the government parlays a string of statistics to vindicate its version of the closed and censored internet. To be sure, Chinese government censors are already sanitising and managing the expectations of the home audience. Live broadcast of the match, originally scheduled on state broadcaster CCTV5, got cancelled. The game can’t be found on many of the most-watched streaming services in China, such as Tencent Video and Sina.com. The only official live stream is available on Youtube, which is banned in China. Chinese media organisations have also been instructed to play down any mention of “Google” in DeepMind, as the American search engine and its related services are banned in China. Still, DeepMind is putting on a good show, organising a five-day weiqi festival in Wuzhen, where players can hold experimental matches against artificial intelligence, or form teams against a single machine player. “AlphaGo’s successes hint at the possibility for general AI to be applied to a wide range of tasks and areas, to perhaps find solutions to problems that we as human experts may not have considered,” Hassabis said. The rise of technology may eventually destroy the human race, warned the British physicist Stephen Hawking. “There is no real difference between what can be achieved by a biological brain and what can be achieved by a computer,” Hawking said, adding that AI will be able to redesign itself at an ever-increasing rate. “Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn’t compete and could be superseded by AI.” Ke, a child prodigy who turned professional at the age of 11, has attained the ninth dan, the highest ranking in the weiqi world. He plays against AlphaGo on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, each game lasting seven hours. While playing down expectations of the outcome, he stressed that humanity’s trumph over the machine is in the game’s intangible magic, instead of the bits and bytes. AlphaGo “is after all a cold machine, and I cannot see its passion and its enthusiasm” for the game, he said. “I will use all my passion to have the final fight against it. No matter how strong my opponent is, i will not retreat.” Tech Wrap Get updates direct to your inbox E-mail * By registering you agree to our T&Cs & Privacy Policy Thank youYou are on the list.   Most Popular Viewed 1 Alibaba to deploy 1 million smart delivery vehicles 2 Instagram worst social media for youth mental health, study says 3 Is China’s top Go master humanity’s last hope against AlphaGo? 4 Skin deep: how China’s scientists are putting colour into the complexions of ‘human’ robots 5 JD.com to let drones do the heavy lifting in China’s rural areas Shared 1 Is China’s top Go master humanity’s last hope against AlphaGo? 2 Alibaba to deploy 1 million smart delivery vehicles 3 Instagram worst social media for youth mental health, study says 4 JD.com to let drones do the heavy lifting in China’s rural areas 5 Skin deep: how China’s scientists are putting colour into the complexions of ‘human’ robots Commented 1 Death toll at 22 as police assess grim aftermath of Manchester blast 2 North Korea is addicted to missiles: it’s intervention or war 3 Additional 200 Cathay Pacific staff face the sack 4 The curious timing of the China spy-killing report 5 Opposition forces city to slash illegal parking fines rise Promotions Get your FREE LuxeHomes Property Outlook 2017 now!

Picture: AP Photo/Richard Vogel APPLE is taking the smartphone war right to Google by launching a major campaign to get users to ditch their Android phones, and offering them cash to switch to an iPhone. The tech giant launched the provocatively titled “Switch from Android” website and a series of five YouTube videos as part of its campaign, in a sizeable push that hasn’t been seen since Apple’s “Get a Mac” advertisements launched more than a decade ago. APPLE’S iPhone 8’s new design leaked Apple has launched a "Switch from Android" website as part of a campaign to recruit new iPhone users from Google.Source:Supplied Promising “life is easier on iPhone,” the website touts the Apple phones’ cameras, speed, and customer support but it also has a not-so-subtle dig at Google’s smartphone security record. “Unlike many other phones, important data on your iPhone is encrypted from the start and protected by your passcode,” the Apple website reads. “Apple apps like Maps and Safari help to keep private all the places you go and the sites you visit, and Apple will not sell your information to anyone for any reason.” The website also reiterates Apple’s offer of up to $250 as a trade-in for your old phone, although a Samsung Galaxy S6 only earns $150 in credit. Google recently launched its own voice assistant in Apple’s App Store. Picture: AP Photo/Eric RisbergSource:AP Apple’s move comes as its grip on the smartphone market climbed slightly in the last three months of 2016, according to research firm Gartner, but not nearly as much as Google Android’s share of the market. More than 81 per cent of the world’s smartphones use Google’s software, compared to almost 18 per cent that run Apple’s system. Samsung was also the world’s top smartphone maker in 2016, claiming more than 20 per cent of all sales, compared to Apple’s 14 per cent. But the Apple iPhone 7 claimed the title of most popular smartphone in Australia in March, according to Kantar Worldpanel, even though it’s swamped by Android rivals. Apple previously published a guide on how to switch from Android to an iPhone to lure users in 2014, before releasing an official Move to iOS app in 2015. Both followed the successful “Get a Mac” advertising campaign that ran from 2006 to 2009, featuring Justin Long personifying Apple’s computers.

Years after Beijing locked out virtually every Alphabet Inc service, executive chairman Eric Schmidt and a cadre of mid-level Chinese government officials kicked off a summit in the canal-laced town of Wuzhen today: A rare instance of the search leader working in tandem with the country’s bureaucrats at a high-profile public event. Google experts and prominent local academics will exchange notes and host discussions but the centrepiece will be the 2,500-year-old strategy board game between DeepMind’s so-far undefeated AlphaGo system and local champion Ke Jie. Google’s absence from China — a country it initially withdrew from amid fears of censorship and cyber-attacks — remains the biggest gap in its dominance of global search and video. While Android is the country’s most popular mobile software and it sells advertising, other services including search, Gmail, apps and maps are barred by the mainland’s firewall. Speculation persists however that it now wants back in, starting with partnerships with local Android app stores or its searchable database of academic knowledge, Google Scholar. “It’s a pleasure to be back in China, a country that I admire a great deal,” Schmidt told assembled dignitaries and industry executives. “What you see before you is an extraordinary opportunity to change the world.” Schmidt’s tone was markedly different from 2010, when Google declared it was pulling out of the country because it would no longer self-censor content for Chinese users — something Beijing requires of all media to maintain stability. Officials promptly accused the company of violating agreements made before entering the market. Google also said its systems had been hacked from within China, while Beijing denied involvement. The US giant then began redirecting search users to Hong Kong before the government eventually blocked that entirely, helping competitor Baidu Inc solidify its domestic lead. The event Schmidt’s presiding over is held at the same venue the government hosts its annual World Internet Conference, to promote its own perspectives on the web. The summit marks the latest in a series of efforts to re-engage China: In 2016, Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said the company wanted to be back serving local users, and it holds regular events in various cities to woo developers. In 2015, Google announced its first direct investment in a Chinese company since pulling out, as it backed local smartwatch and AI software developer Mobvoi Inc. This time round, Google and its DeepMind AI unit is also appealing in no small way to local sentiment. AlphaGo made headlines last year after winning a five-match tournament against Lee Sedol, considered the world’s best player of Go over the past decade. The widely-covered contest provoked discussion on social media about whether an AI system could beat a player from China — the nation that spawned the game several millennia ago. Ke declared at the time a machine could never defeat a true Chinese master, though he’s since lost a number of casual online matches to Google’s AI. DeepMind’s success astounded experts, who thought it would take as much as a decade before AI could beat top-ranked professional players of the game. While its rules are simple — players battle for territory by placing white or black stones on a 19-by-19 grid of squares — it’s regarded as far more complex than chess, by an order of magnitude of 10 followed by 99 zeros. AlphaGo’s original victory in Seoul positioned Google as a leader in next-generation super-smart computing. The search giant now uses AI in a range of products — automatically writing emails, recommending YouTube videos and helping cars drive themselves. Google hopes to showcase the evolution of machine intelligence this week in Wuzhen, Demis Hassabis, chief executive officer and co-founder of Google DeepMind, wrote in a recent blog post. The aim of the forum is to discuss how machine-learning methods behind AlphaGo can be useful in grappling with real-world issues, such as energy consumption. “What Google and Alphabet have brought are all of the projects that we’ve been doing, to work on artificial intelligence,” Schmidt told the conference. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Google cosies up to China with AI secrets and a game of Go Take-Two pushes ‘Red Dead’ launch to next year From legally blind to clear vision — thanks to eSight (VIDEO) Russian cyber criminals stealing from bank clients nabbed (VIDEO) Free carpooling app for Singapore mosque-goers in time for Ramadan Anonymous whiz kid foils WannaCry cyberattack Cyber kid stuns experts showing toys can be ‘weapons’ Hackers steal 17 million users’ data from Indian restaurant app Zomato Wiko Harry smartphone enters Malaysia Microsoft withheld update that could have slowed WannaCry, report claims (VIDEO) Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: One Direction's Styles tops Billboard with solo album Moment sea lion grabs girl and pulls her into water goes viral Reuters Video: British police treating deadly concert blast as 'terrorist incident' Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Related Articles Google AI programme beats top-ranked Go player Ready, Set, Go!

Then, John Gruber of Daring Fireball linked to the article and added his own comments, such as how AMP pages scroll differently than the rest of Safari. The creator of Google AMP then explained the scrolling difference, and how Apple will change scrolling in Safari to be like AMP. But let’s go back to the beginning and explain what it all means. What is AMP? In 2015, Google launched the Accelerated Mobile Pages project, or AMP. It’s a special web format web developers and publishers can use to display their web pages and have them load quickly on smartphones. While it sounds great at first, not many developers like the idea of giving Google control over their content. AMP strips out web analytics and special elements like interactive maps and photo galleries. Because of the way AMP is implemented, it even breaks certain features of Safari. How AMP Screws With Safari Google AMP breaks Safari Reader, the “tap status bar to scroll up” function, and Safari’s Find on Page extension. It also messes with Safari’s scrolling on iOS, which was John Gruber’s complaint. But Malte Ubl, the creator of Google AMP, explains: With respect to scrolling: We (AMP team) filed a bug with Apple about that (we didn’t implement scrolling ourselves, just use a div with overflow). We asked to make the scroll inertia for that case the same as the normal scrolling. Apple’s response was (surprisingly) to make the default scrolling like the overflow scrolling. So, with the next Safari release all pages will scroll like AMP pages. Inception: A website in AMP format explaining Google AMP. Breaking it Down User Om2 points out in response to Malte Ubl: In current iOS Safari, webpage scrolling is inconsistent from all other scrolling on the system. This was an intentional decision made long ago. In addition, overflow areas are consistent with the rest of the system, and thus inconsistent with top-level webpage scrolling. This is semi-accidental. In reviewing scroll rates, we concluded that the original reason was no longer a good tradeoff. Thus this change, which removed all the inconsistencies: https://trac.webkit.org/changeset/211197/webkit. Having all scrolling be consistent feels good once you get used to it. Throughout iOS and macOS, Apple implements inertial scrolling, also called momentum scrolling. It’s when you swipe to scroll up or down, and when you lift up your finger, the page continues to scroll on its own for a short distance. Most—if not all—apps use this, and it’s the reason why using an iPhone feels like such a fast and smooth experience. If you’re a web developer, you’re probably familiar with the CSS property webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch. This lets you add inertial scrolling to overflow elements. If you add it to a fixed size element, then the content will also have inertial scrolling. Apple patent: “Continuous scrolling with acceleration” The problem is that very few web developers apply inertial scrolling. This is why, when you browse in iOS Safari, the web page will stop when your finger lifts off the screen. You have to put more effort into getting to the top or bottom of the page. But the good news is that Apple plans to update iOS and bring inertial scrolling to Safari. This will make it consistent with the rest of the system, and should give your thumb less of a workout. We’re not sure when this will happen. MacRumors noted that inertial scrolling isn’t found in the iOS 10.3.3 beta, so it’s possible Apple will wait to bring it to iOS 11.

Google's computer vision will soon be able to automatically remove obstructions in photos Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/05/17 10:37am PDTMay 17, 2017 29 Plus 1 on G+ 111 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares187 Google News Google I/O is underway one of the first topics covered was the great strides the company has made in image recognition software. Further improvements in computer vision are enabling Google products to see the attributes behind the picture and break them down into constituent parts. This is powered by machine learning and capable of some incredible image editing feats. In the example used by Google CEO Sundar Pichai on stage during his keynote, we see an image of a girl playing baseball taken from behind a wire fence. Using Google's AI, he then removes the fence in a snap, getting rid of the obstruction and leaving behind only what's important. Before. After. While the example maybe looks a little bit strange at first, this could be a really useful tool for those less technically advanced (like me) wanting to edit photos quickly. The I/O keynote is happening right now if anyone wants to jump in and see what else Google has up its sleeve. Tags computer vision Google image recognition io17 io2017 video subscribe ...

Nigel Antonio Google Goggles eh? thevigilante That's Google Vision Stakoman FUCK YEAAA Rod That's very impressive. JC Excitement will be reserved for an actual demo. -Matoro Zeliph- This would be awesome if I can take pictures of animals behind a cage in the zoo and Google photos clears it up. It would be awesome if most zoos didn't have cages. demarcmj Probably not awesome for all the people getting maimed in the zoo though. Patrick Probably not awesome for all of those out of work cages Jasper Makkinje So... dual-lens camera on Pixel 2 confirmed? raazman No, this will work with existing hardware. Nick Coad That makes literally no sense in the context of this article. Jasper Makkinje Well, they will need /some/ way of interpolating the missing data (i.e. the obscured part of the image). So either they 'guess' based on the surrounding pixels (which, I believe, wouldn't result in the excellent performance shown in the video), or they require you to show the camera the obstructed part of the image yourself... which can be done either through moving the camera (think PhotoLens), or by having two lenses which are slighty apart, allowing the phone to combine the two pictures and remove obstacles. Then they can perhaps using a little bit of machine learning to 'guess' whatever part it can't remove by just combining the two images, but definitely not just that. So I think it does make sense in the context of this video. Furthermore, rumor has it that the Pixel 2 will have full Tango-hardware on board, which would make a lot of sense to me, given the fact that they're advertising this feature. And @raazman:disqus: Many existing phones also have dual-lens setups :) They might even have two versions of this: one where you move the camera a bit to remove obstructions, and another version for dual-lens phones, that can do it without the extra movement. Nick Coad A dual lens camera won't have enough separation between the lenses to capture obscured objects. This works by guessing based on the surrounding pixels (with a lot of machine learning thrown in). Marcus Can it remove my brother's ex-girlfriend from my wedding photos? Kostas 💪🎩 Tell yourself she is just a stranger and move on 🦄 whispy_snippet This is kinda like Photoshop's content aware feature... but for the masses. Incredible. JG On a related note... Wasn't Google (or some other company?) working on a means to remove reflections from images (like pictures taken behind a tour bus window)? I think they (or someone) was working on it a few years back. Don't seem to recall hearing anything beyond the "Hey this is what we're doing" announcement. mike shwilly Microsoft has an app to take a picture without any obstructions. But you have to stand and wait until everything goes out of the shot JG You have to wait until everything goes out of the shot... Wouldn't that work for any camera then? Coincidentally, I recently stumbled upon an article from LifeHacker or a similar site explaining how to remove tourist from your photos. Their suggested approach, take several photos, 5-10 seconds apart. Then load said photos into PhotoShop and select the mean tool/option. As long as no one stops and stand in the same spot for to long/in too many photos, you should get a picture of just the statue or church or whatever. Nick Coad I think he meant that you need to wait for everything to have moved enough for an entire image of the background to be able to be reconstructed. Nick Coad I remember the article you're thinking of. I think it was purely academic, I don't think it was planned as an actual app. But yeah, I'd love to see that appear in an app somewhere too! abc Is that real, or did they simply take a photo without the fence and claim their software removed it? Imparus It is real, the question is how it will handle more complex stuff, like say if there were people instead of a forest behind the fence, that one would be much more difficult to fix. Nick Coad There's nothing remotely hard to believe about the example posted here, it's pretty well understood (but still very, very cool) technology at the moment. It's limited only by the amount of data it can consume in order to learn how to accurately fill in blanks in images, of which Google likely has the most, which is why this is potentially exciting. Like the other commenter, @Imparus:disqus, has said though: the real test will be how it handles more complex backgrounds with less predictable areas to fill in.

The world's most popular internet search engine has been in the Commission's crosshairs since 2010 over the promotion of its own shopping service in internet searches at the expense of the services of rivals.

It has since levelled a third charge, that of blocking rivals in online search advertising. This relates to Google's "AdSense for Search" platform, in which Google acts as an intermediary for websites such as online retailers, telecoms operators or newspapers. These searches produce results that include search ads. "In the next few months, we will reach a decision on the Google cases, Google search, AdSense and to me the most interesting is Android," Tommaso Valletti, the Commission's chief competition economist, told a conference organised by the University of Oxford Centre for Competition Law and Policy. Watch video review of Redmi note 4 black The Commission has already warned Google that it would be fined if found guilty of breaching EU antitrust rules. Sanctions could reach 10 percent of annual global turnover for each case. Alphabet made consolidated revenues of around $90 billion in 2016. Google has in the past rejected the accusations, saying that its innovations had increased choice for European consumers and promoted competition. It made three unsuccessful attempts to settle the internet search case without any finding of wrongdoing and sanctions with European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager's predecessor, Joaquin Almunia.

SMS support for Hangouts officially ends today, excluding Google Voice and Project Fi subscribers Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/22 2:29pm PDTMay 22, 2017 64 Plus 1 on G+ 177 Share on Facebook 77 Share on Twitter Total Shares318 Applications Google News Videos Today is the day that Hangouts finally loses SMS support. We were warned by Google about it months ago when Hangouts started showing a warning that it would no longer support the feature. But, as of today, it's finally set to happen. For anyone that isn't on Project Fi or Google Voice — both of which will continue to support SMS in Hangouts — this is the end of an era. Many people, myself included, made the final push into Hangouts over other services when SMS support was added. The integrated conversations made it much easier to keep short communications together in one place. So far there's no word on if SMS support will be coming to Allo. Now that Hangouts support for SMS is finally over, we aren't really left with a clear migration method. Anyone that might have made use of it will have to either deal with using two separate apps again or move over to a new service. If you are looking for recommendations, Google's stock Android Messages isn't so bad. But, if you've been enjoying having SMS and chats merged, that isn't really a solution. Allo is always an option. But, that's the same issue from the other side, you'd still need to find a way to send SMS messages. There's always Facebook Messenger or Signal, which both provide a combined SMS and chat solution. Each has its disadvantages, though.  The latter doesn't have quite the same feature set that Hangouts did, and the former is a Facebook product. Either way, it's closing time. You might have just enough left to send one last SMS before the lights are shut off. If you still plan on using Hangouts for chats going forward, make sure you've updated to the latest version of over at Google Play or APKMirror. Download QR-Code Hangouts Developer: Google Inc.

Undone in naught but a few years, with this final limb being ripped from the body. But I guess I'm on Project Fi, so I'm good for now. My parents weren't happy about this news, since our family communicates primarily on large Hangouts threads. mxwp but if they are using actual Hangouts IM threads and not SMS they can still use Hangouts Adrien Aubel IMHO those big plans haven't been followed by strict coding/design rules, and Hangouts became progressively a technical mess, then a true nightmare for anybody to work on, with the UI becoming slower with each version, fortunately partly compensated by faster phones. To be fair, SMS/MMS can be very complicated to deal with, and Android development was much harder and potentially messy when Babel has been developed, the technologies available nowadays would have helped a lot. So down the road it would have been neither productive or future-proof to keep iterating all efforts inside Hangouts, at least without a total recode from the ground up. Right now I wonder if they will indeed clean the code up to remove all carrier SMS/MMS, and eventually speed up the app and make it smaller, or just roughly disable it. t_newt If Hangouts became a technical mess, the solution isn't to drop Hangouts, it's to fix Hangouts. They could have made it a framework for their products that any of their messengers could be installed into. Instead they are trying to make it an enterprise Slack competitor. What company is going to trust their company to Google's leftovers? "SMS/MMS can be very complicated to deal with". Apparently this is true at Google. Duder12 They aren't getting the left overs. They are getting two brand new products. Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat. My name is…. Nobody ever used Hangouts for SMS outside America. Actually, nobidy uses SMS no more. There DOES exist a world outside America, you know, and its much bigger!! sproc Haha, you wish. Everyone I know is stuck on sms. They try whatsapp and stuff then abandon it. Adrien Aubel Especially iOS users, who already have a great "Messages" app that outsmarts SMS when possible. For them it doesn't make too much sense to download another messaging app every now and then. Rodrigo Gomes da Silva So.. where are you from? Jay No you wish, but you must be in the states. No one i know uses SMS anymore. It's an archaic dead service, only used for bank transaction notifications and amazon deliveries. Everyone else is either on whatsapp (yes 220 million of us in this country and growing at 4 million a month) or (wechat which is like what 85-90 percent of China) No one cares for SMS. TheDrunkenClam What an unnecessarily smug and nagging comment. Winston Well it's true, even if it's smug. Outside the US, SMS is pretty much dead as we've all moved towards WhatsApp, as carriers still don't give unlimited texts by default. I think it's time to start asking another company for SMS integration. Christopher Gannon That would work if so many people in the US weren't using iMessage, where the only way a non-apple user can chat is via SMS. Then apple makes it very difficult NOT to use it, so good luck convincing your friends to give up siri, etc. I'd also like a solution, like hangouts or iMessage, where messages aren't restricted to a phone, and I can seamlessly use both on my laptop, tablet or phone. Ryan Yes, but we still have all of the money. Magister Good for them. I live in us and everyone uses sms, so that's what I use. What everyone else uses is moot. Michael Sørensen Nonsense. I'm not in the US (Europe) and the VAST majority in my country still use SMS. Jason Hirsch I was very annoyed at having to add Hangouts as my SMS client. I couldn't keep separate separate anymore. Now in combination with Fi, GV, 2 phones and obi it's a nightmare. On this overseas trip i couldn't force Fi to dial via WiFi. So i had to go back and install Hangouts dialer. If they (Google) have a master plan there's no rhyme or reason to it. atc-tech Google Voice users should still be able to use it too, I think? I don't know. I switched the the updated GV app when it came out around the same time the hangouts DEintegration was announced, so I'm not sure, but I think Voice users still can... Aaron Berlin Who knows what the plan is long-term for GVoice in Hangouts, but the actual GVoice app is actually good now. No equivalent to the chrome extension/desktop app, though. Ryne Hager You are right, Google Voice users can also continue to receive SMS messages in the app, I'll make that more clear. atc-tech Cool. I wasn't sure GV still could, but I thought I remembered hearing that we could. I gave up already though and use the prettier new GV app... Wish they would add back more features though. Ryne Hager The new app is so pretty. I do wish my GV voicemails would show up in my call logs again, though. mxwp i exclusively use my GVoice number for calls and texts and use it on Hangouts. the update GVoice app has an annoying bug in that it tries to connect every account on your phone instead of just your main one. i have submitted it as a bug but have not heard anything back Tom Harman So when does Allo officially get SMS support, lol. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Same time it gets tablet support: Never. rndusrnm479461 Am I the only one who doesn't understand what's so good about SMS integration in either Allo or Hangouts? Is it really hard for you people to use 2 apps? Jesus christ. Google's "Android Messages" is lightweight anyway, why is it such a problem to use it? It shouldn't even eat much RAM. Kyle Gospodnetich Yes, yes you are. Please never work for Google, or really any company that has a hand in communications. My name is…. No, he is not Kyle Gospodnetich Congrats, now there's two of you idiots. iluvthesoftsoft One do-it-all app > two apps Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi, https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi, we're trying to fix texting on Android and provide transparent switch between SMS&IM (devices handshake when you get into chats so that we determine whether you or the recipient has poor reception and should prefer SMS for example). MJ Two apps? One app for SMS and than Facebook, WhatsApp, Allo/Hangouts, and whatever to cover all my contacts. SMS is the only thing I can message 100% of my contacts with. Adrien Aubel Google's messaging strategy is now: - Android Messages for carriers & OEMs - meaning strictly SMS/RCS - Allo for their new consumer messaging service, and the focus of their upcoming work - Hangouts for business/enterprise They can't risk to upset carrier and OEMs by implementing non-carrier features in Android Messages / the default SMS app they provide. Or at least it's a risk they're not ready to take at that time. Btw I wouldn't say "Android Messages" is that lightweight btw, notably on modern devices it could be so much smoother :( sam1331 I don't get it either. When Android Messages came out I switched my SMS over to it. I quickly realized I was using it almost exclusively for 2 factor verification codes. But really, the notifications all go to the same place, I already have to decide whether to use Hangouts or Facebook Messenger when talking to basically anyone anyway. I also think people should push a little harder to move conversations over from SMS to something else, I've never found that to be very difficult. mxwp SMS is convenient because you know it will work with any American with a cell phone... including "dumb" flip phones. And it actually is really difficult to get people to switch to another service. Apple users just use imessage to send their SMS to me. And then I send them my glorious green bubbles and those ishills can suck it. YaKillaCJ Sms integration is important because it is supported by 100% of telecommunications service providers and integrated on all devices that can make a phone call and has a screen. You can even sms a home phone without a screen depending on carrier/service provider. Thus it messaging that works with 100% of your contacts. Having multiple Apps spread across 100s of contacts is plain annoying. So if any App wants to be taken serious, it needs to be serious and have sms. What's App already fills the void for bypassing sms across the globe. rndusrnm479461 This answer makes the most sense. Thanks. Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi! play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi We're still new and young but we're very serious about our ambitions and not settling when we know it could/should be better. To fix texting on Android, we provide transparent switch between SMS&IM (devices handshake when you get into chats so that we determine whether you or the recipient has poor reception and should prefer SMS for example). Very handy in some countries/areas/events. And lets you reach *anybody* (that has a phone number). My name is…. Nobody uses SMS no more, and if i wanna send a text message to the last of the Mohicans, i will use my SMS app. I dont want no stupid integration and no stupid 'SMS fallback' that will make things worse. Chatting is not texting. YaKillaCJ There are only 2 widely used methods of messaging across mobile devices. Sms and What's App. Sms is supported on EVERY device from 2 way pagers and flip phones to house phones and smartphones. Any device that has a phone number supports sms. The majority of people doesn't care about added features like stickers and gif. We just care that all I need is the person phone number and from there I can call or text them. That's it. Bottom line is that it has to be a standard adopted by carriers on a worldwide scale. Hence what's app reason for such large scale use is it uses existing phone numbers for login, existing phone book for contact list, free, minimum data usage and encrypted. Even that is still not even used by a third of the devices that use sms. Ryuuie Last I checked, WhatsApp charged $1 or someshit. erptastic It has not done that officially for years. And even before that, they always just extended my account. disqus_Xz3y8OiO3O It's free mxwp in the larger scheme of things, I agree with you that it is not a big deal. still, having one app do both was convenient. the other complaint is Android fanboys being envious of iMessage, which Hangouts could have become. exadeci The main reason that people use Imessage is that you get rich messaging capabilities out of the box if the person you are talking to has an Iphone everything is abstracted, you add someone's number and you start chatting right aways no need to exchange accounts id's or find which app you both use. And if the other doesn't have an Iphone you can still message them or if you killed your data plan it sends an sms. But Google doesn't add sms support because they are pushing for RCS which is a GOOD thing: Standalone Messaging 1-to-1 Chat Group Chat File Transfer Content Sharing Social Presence Information IP Voice call Best Effort Video call Geolocation Exchange Audio Messaging Network based blacklist Capability Exchange based on Presence or SIP OPTIONS All this WITHOUT using any data, data needs an link to be established this doesn't. Chris Hannan It's not hard for most of us to use it. The problem is the people we contact don't want to use separate apps. Everyone with iPhones uses iMessage because it just works by default. But barely anybody I know uses Hangouts and nobody I know uses Allo. If it was all built into one app that shipped with Android phones, more people would use it. Troy Leonard and I removed Hangouts as of today I will no longer consider using any google messaging service ever again Sruly J Isn't Gmail a form of messaging? (Or do you not use Gmail?) Troy Leonard Not for long I'm transitioning over to outlook.com. And upgrading my phone to an iPhone. I'm sick of slow to no updates on my phone,and done with Google ruining everything I ever liked about their apps and Android. naysayer Good riddance. Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi), a new app that we're making that brings a lot of the goodies iMessage brings to iOS users, with big long-term ambitions, and still trying to preserve a consistent and sleek UI. Hopefully that will make you stick to Android and you'll make your iPhone friends jealous in a few months/years ;) Zsolt V Why bother evangilizing? He already decided Outlook on an iPhone is better than Gmail, so let him enjoy it. Troy Leonard Your link is broken Adrien Aubel Fixed thanks! Disqus didn't like the closing ')' at the end of the link. XgudwilX eww outloook😲 Total Insecurity Saying "upgrading my phone to an iPhone" is the same as converting from atheism to any religion. Just a downgrade. bekifft It's true, and their failings and obvious ulterior motives in messaging have, for the first time in a decade, made me consider moving my email back to a private service over which I have control. Roy Thank you and have a nice flight. -Matoro Zeliph- Just want to make sure I'm not missing anything. So Google Voice SMS will no longer work too? Corbin Davenport That will still work as well. Ryne Hager Google voice will still work, just like Fi. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ It's primarily that regular SMS will no longer function in the app. A while back they killed of threading of SMS/MMS and Hangout messages, and now they are killing SMS/MMS entirely out of the app and suggestin people to switch to Android Messages. Bill Blandford Hangouts SMS looks like it still works for Google Voice SMS too. Essentially, this is like Fi, which is a Google Voice number at heart. My wifi-only-device kids use Hangouts to call and text with a Google Voice #. Timmy Turner Yeah GV will continue to work through Hangouts since the number you use via Project-Fi is a GV given number. Adrien Aubel For people that were still using Hangouts and want to try a new app that also does SMS & IM, that tries to provide a fast & polished experience to fix texting on Android, I'd love some honest feedback! https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi We're trying hard to "make it right" and have so much planned on the roadmap, so any feedback is great to have to tweak things up. Let us know what you think! exadeci While the initiative is nice, why would we use your messaging app? If I want an instant message app that does sms and that no one else uses I already got Signal and at least Signal is proven to be secure. What makes Messenger (Facebook), WhatsApp and Imessage good? Their userbase. Ask anyone for a way to communicate and they will use one of those apps, no need for fallback sms when everyone has an account. Adrien Aubel Thanks for your feedback @exadeci:disqus! Great questions :) And Signal is nice as well! It's not for everybody but if you're happy with it keep using it but make sure to check us out in a few months to check that you haven't been missing out, we're going fast! I think there's much more to iMessage that makes it good than their userbase. It is a polished app that just works, and lets you reach anybody, therefore becoming your trusted "go to" texting app. We expect Google to release this summer new capabilities that will let you use IM in more scenarios. Very interesting stuff that we can't wait to let our users benefit from. But our initial target is actually SMS users, people that unlike you and I don't really care about the details, they just want a reliable app that sends and receive their messages. And they're actually quite happy with SMS/MMS in that regard, it just works (when you don't fight with APNs, something we try to prevent as well). We want to transparently "upgrade" those users that may be using Android Messages or a 3rd party app custom-made for the carrier or OEM, not necessarily developed with great care and polishment, and sometimes truly terrible (really, you wouldn't believe what's on some popular carriers, that most users end up using 10 times a day for years). Right now invi is mostly upgrading the transport of your messages and general experience as we develop another big focus of ours: bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages exchanged being plain text. Texting can be the most impersonal way of communication and this flattens relationships. A bar suggests as you type relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps you transmit how you truly felt when writing this message, it doesn't flatten as much your emotions (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). It always send instantly over IM as well (no upload or anything like that, optimized WebP images for super-fast download). Open your top 3 chats on Signal, chats that you have with people you care the most about, look at all this flat plain texting, and try to visualize the gap compared to what it could be, how it could have been more personal and transmitting more of your feelings or emotions. We're targeting this gap, and again, we're just getting started but have serious ambitions and motivation. If you use Snapchat, look at all that rich media that gets thrown to your eyes or that you throw to people, that doesn't always make sense and is often disconnected from conversations, sometimes losing its value and feeling like you just threw a bottle in the ocean, just leaving you with a list of who saw it. We're looking at that gap as well, as invi becomes more and more rich in terms of content creation. After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. We are in talks with some OEMs and resellers to make invi default which would help grow invi's user base and help us improve our product with more diverse usage, while some upcoming features of invi should ultimately help us get a lot more users naturally. exadeci Signal has actually Gifs from Giphy, stickers and the possibility to send a location but I don't use this kind of feature even on Messenger it's quite rare that I send a sticker. Google is strongly pushing for RCS adoption which would add all these emotions sharing: https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Rogers_Google_RCS.gif https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Telenor_6P_GIF_0UHHQdI.gif https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/RCS_Android_Update.width-600.png Adrien Aubel Exactly, but how relevant is Giphy? Again don't compare with things you've seen so far but with what it could potentially be if it truly understood your relationships and intentions, if it combined that with your taste and the way you usually communicate with this specific person. And what if your friends or other people were able to add their own media and stickers through channels and then be discovered, liked and followed, with deep intelligence powering it all and bringing the right content to the right user? We built invi to support all this, we don't just use a Giphy API, we used the most advanced and lightweight technologies to communicate in realtime with our backend, even on pretty bad 3G, from where we curate the media that eventually gets recommended to you. The screenshots you attached look great as well, but see Android Messages is a good example there's only 5 packs of stickers that won't get more relevant or smarter no matter how many stickers you use or how many times you use Android Messages. Idk who would use a given sticker hundreds of times, but anyway I'm not sure those were really representative of how Android Messages is most commonly used. The features are technically there, as often, but they're very limited in their potential as of now. The Awesome Bar isn't for everyone but can eventually help people like you, as images just get displayed while you're typing, no action required, and if you see one that you like you can just tap it to see how it looks and enrich your message, send and you're done. Google is pushing RCS, very true! And we're excited about the great work the Jibe team did in the past couple years. They're a bit shy to share their RCS client implementation at the moment, it may be unstable or not well documented at the moment, but we're meeting regularly with Google and hope to add RCS to our transparent switch as soon as possible, even though the user base is a bit limited at the moment it has the potential to grow fast and solve many issues. If they're reluctant for too long we may use other hubs that would communicate seamlessly through Unified Profile. But for now, we're watching the number of users actually benefiting from RCS grow while we focus on other areas of improvements. sam1331 I am actually kind of optimistic about all this, more so than I was maybe a year ago. They've been putting out a steady stream or improvements to Allo, and when I've experimented with it with a friend it actually is an enjoyable experience. Releasing it without a web app is just shocking, but if that's added and it works well, I could totally see moving over to it from Hangouts, where I do the vast majority of my communicating. The other piece of the puzzle is Duo. If they can integrate a Duo button in Allo conversations (like it seems they will), and they eventually add group calling, which can't be that far off, then I think it will be a nice solution for myself and my family. And I've got quite a few friends that are all about Android instead of iOS, so I can see them switching to Allo from Hangouts. But not until there is a web app, because they aren't stupid. Chad Knasinski I would use Allo if they added SMS support and a desktop version like Hangouts had. Nick.Trite Same here. I have Fi so I'll continue to use Hangouts for SMS. I really love the fact that I can switch seamlessly from desktop to mobile and still be sending SMS. Until Allo does that, I won't consider moving. Chad Knasinski Ditto Sir_Brizz And multi-device support. Can't even use it or sync it on my LTE Tablet... Carson Saldanha So, basically Hangouts but revamped? We've come in full-circle. Sir_Brizz Sure. The problem is that every other chat platform has these features in 2016. Including Hangouts. Roy Me to, love it. mxwp unless they remove hangouts from gmail, people will still secretly be using "hangouts" all the time. in fact, the only way Allo will ever take off without SMS is if it replaces Hangouts (gtalk) on gmail and inbox. Chad Knasinski So correct me if I am wrong here but Google wants us to do this with our messages: SMS - Google Messenger Business SMS - Hangouts Messages - Allo Facebook - Messenger Video Chat - Duo Business Video Chat - Hangouts Video Really? Are you kidding me here? Timmy Turner You've got it right and if there's a joke, you'll being waiting a while for the punchline. disqus_em5YfkbWdk What Business SMS and how is 8t different from other SMS? Zsolt V What does Facebook have to do with anything you wrote? So you are corrected. SpadeX Are you new to tech world? Timmy Turner I recommend Textra to anyone looking for a new SMS app. Sleek, customizable and continually updated/supported. Adrien Aubel Textra is very nice, notably customization-wise as you said, you can go deep and fine-tune basically any UX element. And it's super fast and lightweight as well. I am working as well on a new SMS app that also provides IM similarly to iMessage on iPhone, and many other features, most of them upcoming though. Would you mind giving me a honest feedback when you have the time? It's called invi on the Play Store https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi Timmy Turner Sure thing. freshprince_87 That invi SMS app is an awesome app. Near flawless app. but I stop using it because I kept having problems with MMS messages and also it just like Allo in the sense where if you uninstall the app and reinstall it on the same phone all your instant messages are all gone including some of the regular SMS /MMS messages. You need to make the app save all your messages on to an account like a Google account in the cloud. So that no matter what device you use the instant messages will still be there. Adrien Aubel @freshprince_87:disqus Thank you for your feedback! MMS can be very tricky and every carrier has its own set of specificities, I'm sorry about that, it shows we're still young but obviously like you said, such a core functionality bug makes our whole effort worthless for you here. Do you mind sharing your carrier, device model, and Android version? Did you try using "Legacy MMS" in the app settings? About the IM sync, that's an issue we're definitely looking into, considering all potential security and privacy issues, notably as some countries like USA recycle pretty aggressively your phone numbers, and with the desire to bring a Web client in mind. Google should announce this summer APIs that will eventually help us regarding security, so stay tuned :) freshprince_87 Thanks. I didn't use the legacy MMS. I hope that you add the IM sync soon. I'm on a T-Mobile service using the Moto Z Play on Android Nougat 7.0 Adrien Aubel Ok thank you, if you don't mind I have other questions to dive into your problem :) What specifically was failing? MMS sending, receiving, or both? Did it show an error? Is it only on group MMS or all MMS? Whatever information you may have will be helpful. Our next release should bring MMS reliability improvements and notably Wifi texting when supported by the carrier (first MMS may send up to 60s to send as we're trying out routes but then all other Wifi MMS should send very fast). Tom Westrick https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5ecvBaqHBk MJ Thank God I use Project Fi otherwise this would suck big time for me. TJ Mills Thank God I have Google voice.... Dracono Love hangouts never used SMS. It also seems most negative reviews about it being slow was always tired to the SMS feature. I'm now curious with the removal of they'll us the opportunity to evolve or let it idle. mxwp it will evolve into a business app... but hopefully still available for consumers VAVAMk_2 Just give us SMS support in Allo for Christ's sake! Adrien Aubel SMS/MMS can be quite hard to deal with technically and Google didn't choose to go that way. It is possibly also due to the push they did to replace the default SMS app on many OEMs and carriers, strategically it's hard for them to push much of Google's agenda through the SMS app they give carriers, and they're mostly limited to SMS/RCS. Roy Christ will not give you SMS, bat Star of David could promise you RCS in Allo. mxwp Big G repeatedly stated it would never happen tim242 Liar. Adrien Aubel https://twitter.com/amitfulay/status/840236304130428928 Roy Great. It's was the plan all along. Now Allow will get RCS and web browser everything gonna integrate with Duo. I'm all the way in. I never like Hangout. I love Allo. #stop stop babies don't you cry. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I don't think that's possible. RCS is still mainly just an extension of SMS. If it doesn't support SMS, I don't see it handling RCS. Roy When RCS will come it will be with SMS already. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Based on what? Besnik Rrustemi No problem guys,we have like 69 other Messaging Apps by Google to choose from and maybe 2 new others coming soon. Roy Haha it's so old. Can someone can come with new jokes here? Besnik Rrustemi Well sorry Old Man then, never knew your age before. * Respect for Old People * Sir_Brizz Let the confusion officially begin! Indianajonze google can go fk themselves Robert Gerhart Why isn't anybody asking the bigger question: why the hell does anyone use outdated SMS in the first place? It's like complaining that Hangouts doesn't integrate butter churns and wagon wheels either. There is nothing more annoying than a text message. Adrien Aubel SMS is always nice to have in some situations, that happen more or less depending on where you live. Uncovered areas, concerts or big games, people having no LTE-enabled plans, or simply on some roads and highways. In USA for example all those scenarios happen a lot, notably in some states. And eventually, in most countries you still use SMS for 3rd party services, banks, transportation, or even government-related messages. Most importantly, in countries that still use SMS you can reach *anybody you know* from one app. And that's really a great thing to have. Now you're right, IM is so much more pleasant. Instant delivery, read status, last active time, way faster image format and transport. At invi ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi ) we try to take advantage of this and combine both the way it should be. When you open a chat with somebody, we trigger a handshake to check that both you and the recipient are well connected. If one of both doesn't answer on time, it simply switches to SMS/MMS, it's automatic and out of your way. Otherwise you take advantage of state-of-the-art transport with some unique optimizations. Try to send a GIF over IM and see how fast it goes, compared to MMS or even Whatsapp. Let me know what you think! Aaron Simple; SMS is ubiquitous. Every cellular device in operation can send and receive SMS, from the most current and expensive flagships like the iPhone and Galaxy, to the cheapest budget devices, all the way down to the oldest flip phones. I can text my dad on his flip, my wife on her Nexus or my Capt on his iPhone and each one will receive that message and reply. Show me an IM that can do all of that (that isn't on the iPhone). I guess that invi app that guy's been pedaling might, but I'm waiting for it to gain some traction before trying to convince anybody to switch to yet another IM. Rod The rest of the world uses Whatsapp, everyone has it installed. JG Even people with generic flip phones? Rod Nope, but I don't remember the last time I saw someone with a flip phone. The poor now bear Galaxy Win/Pocket/etc JG My aunt still has one. She recently attempted to upgrade to a smartphone but that seems to have failed big time... Apparently my telling her to tap the icon that's labeled "EMAIL" to get her email is too complicated... That and the free phone she got is a PoS... 512MB of RAM and only 4GB of storage - with the OS consuming all but like 100MB there of. So it didn't perform quite so hot. She seemed a bit surprised her free phone didn't perform as well as my Pixel XL does... TJ Mills Everyone in China uses Wi chat. Rod USA is a world apart. lomsha Believe it or not, even 2g is still a luxury in some countries, which makes​ instant messaging iffy. In those cases sms is a great alternative. Not everyone is in the 1st world with a sweet smartphone and reliable data access. TJ Mills Standard is better than better. When someone comes up with a universal replacement that works on all classes of phones, then the world can switch. Until then it's a mishmash of services and applications​to communicate. Why does everyone still use email? Because of the standards. Michael Sørensen Convince me why I shouldn't... Currently I can write to anyone for free without first asking them what their preferred platform is. And they can reply for free regardless of said preferred platform. Again, convince me why that's not good enough? And don't say "stickers". Just don't. Security? Bah, no sensitive information sent. Midnitte At this point, I'm held hostage stuck using Hangouts since it's the only thing that natively supports desktop messaging. Sigh. Lord Argyris "Each has its disadvantages, though. The latter doesn't have quite the same feature set that Hangouts did, and the former is a Facebook product." It's lines like these that keep.me coming back to AP. JD My support for Google and their messaging platforms ended the beginning of May. Kelly Clubb Well this sucks for any user that enjoyed an easy to use sms app. I use Hangouts and thankfully for project fi will continue it's support BossMa1n3 Eh..doesn't effect me stop using hangout for sms awhile ago..more interested in a flat screen phone with side bezels as thin as the one in the pic.. Grey PLEASE Bring Hangouts Chat and Hangouts Meet to all users. That has so many new and awesome features. It's like everything Allo isn't. DragoCubed The comment section is rough b_boogey_xl Bye Hangouts! hp-fourtwenty oh ffs...voice is still supported??? hell yeah!! nxtiak I'm waiting for the day G+ contacts disappear from Hangouts.

Editorial: Assistant is the key to Google's Android Automotive project Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/22 10:46am PDTMay 22, 2017 8 Plus 1 on G+ 28 Share on Facebook 45 Share on Twitter Total Shares81 Android OS News Videos Google spent much of the I/O 2017 keynote talking about machine learning. In fact, we heard the phrase "AI first" as a description of Google's current plans. You probably have a little sliver of Google's AI capabilities in your pocket right now—Google Assistant. There's one place in particular Google really wants Assistant to live, and that's in your car. Voice commands in general are extremely well-suited to the car, so it should come as no surprise that Google had two Assistant-infused "Android Automotive" demos on-hand at I/O—one from Volvo (above) and another from Audi. It's more clear now than ever that Google wants to be the smart interface for your car, and it plans to do it with Assistant. Your car with Android The Android Automotive project (just an internal name for now) was rumored in 2016, and the first demo of such a system was showcased at CES early this year. This is distinct from Android Auto, which Google released alongside Lollipop. However, it took several months before the first aftermarket head units and new cars arrived with support for the platform. Progress on Auto has been slow ever since. It does barely anything now that it couldn't do at launch. Perhaps that's because Google is currently more interested in making Android the car's operating system. With Android Auto, your phone simply projects an interface to the car's display, but Android Automotive is a car that actually runs Android as its infotainment system. There have been cars running Android before—many Honda and Hyundai vehicles still do, actually. They're very old builds that are almost completely unrecognizable as Android, though. By working with automakers, Google can make the interface more modern and get its services embedded in the car. The two Android Automotive concepts being demoed at I/O were surprisingly full-featured. Check out our video from the event if you want to see how Android in the car actually works. One of the first things you'll notice about this new take on Android in the car is that it's fast... well, faster than Android Auto. Android Auto tends to lag heavily at times for no discernible reason. The fact that it's still preferable to the stock in-car software is a testament to how little automakers have innovated in this space. The two interfaces demoed were also very different from each other, indicating Google might give automakers even more freedom to modify Android than phone OEMs do. Actually, the Volvo interface was visually similar to Volvo's current software (which is not Nougat, obviously). Both demos were based on Android 7.0 with an eye toward migrating to Android O when it's final. Importantly, Android Automotive runs Google services and Android apps without connecting an Android phone. The apps are essentially the same as the ones you currently use in Android Auto. They're limited to audio and messaging apps, and you do have to wonder how long those apps and services will be up to date. Phone updates can take ages, and cars could be much worse. Assistant everywhere An often expressed fear is that a car with Android-based infotainment features will eventually become extremely outdated. After all, you keep a car much longer than you do a phone. Will the apps and services running on that car ever be updated? Will developers eventually drop support for in-car apps on these older versions of Android? There are a lot of unknowns right now. Audi's Demo Googlers seem to have a go-to line when you ask about updates to Android-infused cars—they talk about Project Treble. Google is cognizant of the fact that automakers seldom update the software on cars, but the hope is that updates will still happen occasionally if Google can make it easier. There's also a lot of talk about Assistant in the car, and I had several Googlers cite this as a way to make apps and services more accessible while you're driving regardless of what version of Android your car runs. Apps installed in the car might not be updated very quickly (or at all), but that's not a concern in the cloud. After connecting an app or service to Assistant, it's accessible from your phone, a Google Home, Android Auto, or even a car running Android that hasn't seen an update lately. Thus, developers don't necessarily have to worry about specifically supporting old versions of Android in the car, they simply need to take advantage of Assistant. You can do things with Assistant voice commands that are very much outside the bounds of road-safe media and messaging apps. Assistant's smarter voice commands have the potential to be extremely useful while you're driving. There was a wall of smart home devices next to the Volvo car in order to demonstrate how you could adjust your humble abode in advance of your arrival. Hot day? Crank the AC before you roll into the driveway. You also have more control over the car with Assistant as part of the car's OS—for instance, you could control the climate or open the sunroof, which isn't feasible in Android Auto. Having Assistant built into the car also means more people will use it. Even iOS users who don't have an Android phone to plug in will be able to use Assistant in these vehicles, and that gets them into the Google ecosystem. Assistant is very much hit or miss right now. Sometimes you ask Assistant a question or issue a command only to be greeted with a cloyingly polite apology. Still, it's getting better, and some of the things Google demoed could be great experiences. Regardless of possible update issues down the road, Google's involvement with car infotainment will lead to more modern versions of Android at launch, and Assistant could help your car's software remain useful.

At least for me. Impatiently waiting... ShahinTr All we need is our Assistant to be voiced as Kitt. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7d287ac75059f48cc9bac82680837bc707448769b35d9a2c20ef2af572856780.jpg JG That would be awesome... A customized "Hey KITT" trigger phase would be great to, though doubtful they'd ever make one without Google in it. Daniel Actually, now that we have an SDK for Google Assistant, I'm pretty sure that's very close to happening. Leon I'd also settle for Majel Barrett. Drinster I think the UI looks terrible the demo from last year in the Maserati looks way more better. Rawhi Mohammad SEXXXXXXY I WANT IT.. #APKPLZ xfullmetal17 Because the OEMs hadn't gotten their fingers all over the UI in the Maserati last year. iampwd One thing is for sure, I want that car. Oleg Vorkunov Google now worked much better than assistant. Now I want to throw my watch and phone away. leganzish Android Auto is as good as dead. It barely got more functional since its introduction and will only languish more now that Google has moved on. The thing I don't like is the car being data independent. That's the beauty of the "projection" method of Android Auto. I don't want to live in a future where I have a data connection for my phone, my tablet, my watch, my car, my refrigerator, my washer, and my dryer. I want a data connection for my phone and everything else to be able to piggy-back off of that. whispy_snippet I really doubt it's dead. What about the millions of people who don't intend to buy a car for years or have just bought a car with Android Auto? The majority of people sit in this category. Sure, "Automotive" is probably the future. But I think Android Auto has plenty more to come. leganzish I'm not saying its going to disappear of the face of the earth tomorrow. Just that it will languish. It has already had fairly slow adoption. I would expect adoption rates to slow now that Google has tipped their hand on the next automotive initiative. If consumers get frustrated at the Hangouts situation, I think the very careful/conservative (when it comes to tech progress) automotive brands will be extremely hesitant to invest in Android Auto when it appears to have fallen out of Google's favor. whispy_snippet Hmmm I'm still not convinced. For one, getting car makers to adopt Android Auto has been challenging enough. Convincing hundreds of car makers to suddenly drop their existing operating systems and hand full control to Google is going to take a lot of persuasion and a lot of time. In the short to mid term it's going to be easier to convince car makers to offer a "plug and play" connectivity feature that consumers demand, without the need to cede full control to Google. Remember, a lot of people use iPhones and will demand Apple CarPlay in their next vehicle. Do you think Apple is going to develop a CarPlay app for Android Automotive? I've no doubt Android Automotive is what Google sees as the end goal. But developing a full featured car OS from the ground up, for every single car maker, is an enormous task. In the meantime there are millions and millions of car owners out there with no intention of buying a new vehicle for years. Google has recognised this and its why Android Auto can now run as a stand alone app on phones. And because this app can run on millions of phones, it offers developers plenty of incentive to support it (and thus support Android Auto as a platform broadly). Filipe Santos Car Assistant first, Waze last JasonIvers Android Automotive is still better than some proprietary junk infotainment system from a car manufacturer, even if it's never updated at all. At least you have a reasonably good chance third-party developers will actually build something for it without having to be paid to do so. whispy_snippet My biggest worry about our new world of connected cars is security. Just wait until someone hacks a vehicle's control inputs and causes a crash. What are Google, Apple, car manufacturers, etc going to do about this looming question? abqnm I think that would come down to car manufacturers hardening and isolating essential control systems so they can't be accessed in the event the infotainment system is hacked and somehow allows access to the CAN-BUS. Still, even with access to CAN-BUS, proprietary software over encrypted connections is generally required to access control systems. So it's not like someone can just hack the infotainment system and suddenly can control your steering remotely. There would be a massive amount of protocol reverse-engineering work needed, and it would be on a per-model, per-software build, per-control surface basis. The Jeep exploit that was demoed a couple years back required them to reverse engineer and spend many hundreds of hours to do so. It's a concern, sure, but not a major one. whispy_snippet If a car being hacked could result in someone's death then I would consider it a major concern. The reputation of connected cars and their associated manufacturers and developers are at stake. Just one death as a result of a car being hacked could ripple through the media and cause millions to question the safety of something like Android Automotive. I obviously don't understand how one would hack a car and I'm sure it's ridiculously complex. But if it's possible, I really hope the companies that have our lives in their hands are doing everything they can to mitigate a disaster. It might sound dramatic, but I think it's really important to keep asking these questions. Software exploits are rare, but every now and again we see even the big companies drop the ball (Apple with its iCloud brute force hack, Google with its Google Docs exploit, Microsoft and the ransomware attack). If computers and software are vulnerable, that makes cars with computers and software vulnerable. And when you're hurtling along at 60mph that's well worth our concern. abqnm Since it relies on assistant, does that mean that all cars must now have a data connection? Does or can it use the phone's data connection? There was no indication of connection sharing in the Volvo demo. I really don't want to see cars that I have to pay a monthly subscription fee for a data connection just to be able to tell it to turn off my seat heater. RyanWhitwam The demo cars both had dedicated LTE. That's the way it works right now. Presumably, it would be possible to share the data connection, but that would be up to automakers. whispy_snippet Surely a wireless charging pad with NFC that triggers a WiFi tether arrangement makes sense. Every phone in the near future and onward is going to have wireless charging - we just need an agreed standard of course... ekngee i think Android Automotive is more of a motive-ational push to say "hey, it's easy to use Android to build your infotainment system, rather than do your own from scratch". Android Auto should still stay, because as stated, updates are a big unknown, so i'd rather be safe updating my phone than the car. SAM Few years down the road, people will be talking about android fragmentation on cars, how only 1% of cars are on latest Android version and Android O still wont die.

SMS support for Hangouts officially ends today, excluding Google Voice and Project Fi subscribers Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/22 2:29pm PDTMay 22, 2017 64 Plus 1 on G+ 177 Share on Facebook 77 Share on Twitter Total Shares318 Applications Google News Videos Today is the day that Hangouts finally loses SMS support. We were warned by Google about it months ago when Hangouts started showing a warning that it would no longer support the feature. But, as of today, it's finally set to happen. For anyone that isn't on Project Fi or Google Voice — both of which will continue to support SMS in Hangouts — this is the end of an era. Many people, myself included, made the final push into Hangouts over other services when SMS support was added. The integrated conversations made it much easier to keep short communications together in one place. So far there's no word on if SMS support will be coming to Allo. Now that Hangouts support for SMS is finally over, we aren't really left with a clear migration method. Anyone that might have made use of it will have to either deal with using two separate apps again or move over to a new service. If you are looking for recommendations, Google's stock Android Messages isn't so bad. But, if you've been enjoying having SMS and chats merged, that isn't really a solution. Allo is always an option. But, that's the same issue from the other side, you'd still need to find a way to send SMS messages. There's always Facebook Messenger or Signal, which both provide a combined SMS and chat solution. Each has its disadvantages, though.  The latter doesn't have quite the same feature set that Hangouts did, and the former is a Facebook product. Either way, it's closing time. You might have just enough left to send one last SMS before the lights are shut off. If you still plan on using Hangouts for chats going forward, make sure you've updated to the latest version of over at Google Play or APKMirror. Download QR-Code Hangouts Developer: Google Inc.

Now I like Hangouts just as they EOL it! TechGuy22 LOL 4Ui812 Google hangouts ...

JVF When referring to people it is always "Hanged", sounds funny but that's just how it is. It's a past participle. Ryne Hager Yup, I know. That was the joke. 4Ui812 I understand what you're saying and I debated the proper way to put it..... I have to stand by hanged. instinct I am like 6 different active group chats in Hangouts. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Google doesn't care about you. humulos A truer statement has never been said Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2c9aad5a41d09ce24c4c4e04e7b3a28a2004487ff015df2fc519b5c2a9556024.gif Adrien Aubel Google's messaging strategy is now: - Android Messages for carriers & OEMs - meaning strictly SMS/RCS - Allo for their new consumer messaging service, and the focus of their upcoming work - Hangouts for business/enterprise Nothing personal :) humulos How innocent we once were, at the time when we witnessed Talk, Voice, SMS and G+ Messages become a single product, fulfilling all our dreams. Undone in naught but a few years, with this final limb being ripped from the body. But I guess I'm on Project Fi, so I'm good for now. My parents weren't happy about this news, since our family communicates primarily on large Hangouts threads. mxwp but if they are using actual Hangouts IM threads and not SMS they can still use Hangouts Adrien Aubel IMHO those big plans haven't been followed by strict coding/design rules, and Hangouts became progressively a technical mess, then a true nightmare for anybody to work on, with the UI becoming slower with each version, fortunately partly compensated by faster phones. To be fair, SMS/MMS can be very complicated to deal with, and Android development was much harder and potentially messy when Babel has been developed, the technologies available nowadays would have helped a lot. So down the road it would have been neither productive or future-proof to keep iterating all efforts inside Hangouts, at least without a total recode from the ground up. Right now I wonder if they will indeed clean the code up to remove all carrier SMS/MMS, and eventually speed up the app and make it smaller, or just roughly disable it. t_newt If Hangouts became a technical mess, the solution isn't to drop Hangouts, it's to fix Hangouts. They could have made it a framework for their products that any of their messengers could be installed into. Instead they are trying to make it an enterprise Slack competitor. What company is going to trust their company to Google's leftovers? "SMS/MMS can be very complicated to deal with". Apparently this is true at Google. Duder12 They aren't getting the left overs. They are getting two brand new products. Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat. My name is…. Nobody ever used Hangouts for SMS outside America. Actually, nobidy uses SMS no more. There DOES exist a world outside America, you know, and its much bigger!! sproc Haha, you wish. Everyone I know is stuck on sms. They try whatsapp and stuff then abandon it. Adrien Aubel Especially iOS users, who already have a great "Messages" app that outsmarts SMS when possible. For them it doesn't make too much sense to download another messaging app every now and then. Rodrigo Gomes da Silva So.. where are you from? Jay No you wish, but you must be in the states. No one i know uses SMS anymore. It's an archaic dead service, only used for bank transaction notifications and amazon deliveries. Everyone else is either on whatsapp (yes 220 million of us in this country and growing at 4 million a month) or (wechat which is like what 85-90 percent of China) No one cares for SMS. TheDrunkenClam What an unnecessarily smug and nagging comment. Winston Well it's true, even if it's smug. Outside the US, SMS is pretty much dead as we've all moved towards WhatsApp, as carriers still don't give unlimited texts by default. I think it's time to start asking another company for SMS integration. Christopher Gannon That would work if so many people in the US weren't using iMessage, where the only way a non-apple user can chat is via SMS. Then apple makes it very difficult NOT to use it, so good luck convincing your friends to give up siri, etc. I'd also like a solution, like hangouts or iMessage, where messages aren't restricted to a phone, and I can seamlessly use both on my laptop, tablet or phone. Ryan Yes, but we still have all of the money. Magister Good for them. I live in us and everyone uses sms, so that's what I use. What everyone else uses is moot. Michael Sørensen Nonsense. I'm not in the US (Europe) and the VAST majority in my country still use SMS. Jason Hirsch I was very annoyed at having to add Hangouts as my SMS client. I couldn't keep separate separate anymore. Now in combination with Fi, GV, 2 phones and obi it's a nightmare. On this overseas trip i couldn't force Fi to dial via WiFi. So i had to go back and install Hangouts dialer. If they (Google) have a master plan there's no rhyme or reason to it. atc-tech Google Voice users should still be able to use it too, I think? I don't know. I switched the the updated GV app when it came out around the same time the hangouts DEintegration was announced, so I'm not sure, but I think Voice users still can... Aaron Berlin Who knows what the plan is long-term for GVoice in Hangouts, but the actual GVoice app is actually good now. No equivalent to the chrome extension/desktop app, though. Ryne Hager You are right, Google Voice users can also continue to receive SMS messages in the app, I'll make that more clear. atc-tech Cool. I wasn't sure GV still could, but I thought I remembered hearing that we could. I gave up already though and use the prettier new GV app... Wish they would add back more features though. Ryne Hager The new app is so pretty. I do wish my GV voicemails would show up in my call logs again, though. mxwp i exclusively use my GVoice number for calls and texts and use it on Hangouts. the update GVoice app has an annoying bug in that it tries to connect every account on your phone instead of just your main one. i have submitted it as a bug but have not heard anything back Tom Harman So when does Allo officially get SMS support, lol. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Same time it gets tablet support: Never. rndusrnm479461 Am I the only one who doesn't understand what's so good about SMS integration in either Allo or Hangouts? Is it really hard for you people to use 2 apps? Jesus christ. Google's "Android Messages" is lightweight anyway, why is it such a problem to use it? It shouldn't even eat much RAM. Kyle Gospodnetich Yes, yes you are. Please never work for Google, or really any company that has a hand in communications. My name is…. No, he is not Kyle Gospodnetich Congrats, now there's two of you idiots. iluvthesoftsoft One do-it-all app > two apps Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi, https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi, we're trying to fix texting on Android and provide transparent switch between SMS&IM (devices handshake when you get into chats so that we determine whether you or the recipient has poor reception and should prefer SMS for example). MJ Two apps? One app for SMS and than Facebook, WhatsApp, Allo/Hangouts, and whatever to cover all my contacts. SMS is the only thing I can message 100% of my contacts with. Adrien Aubel Google's messaging strategy is now: - Android Messages for carriers & OEMs - meaning strictly SMS/RCS - Allo for their new consumer messaging service, and the focus of their upcoming work - Hangouts for business/enterprise They can't risk to upset carrier and OEMs by implementing non-carrier features in Android Messages / the default SMS app they provide. Or at least it's a risk they're not ready to take at that time. Btw I wouldn't say "Android Messages" is that lightweight btw, notably on modern devices it could be so much smoother :( sam1331 I don't get it either. When Android Messages came out I switched my SMS over to it. I quickly realized I was using it almost exclusively for 2 factor verification codes. But really, the notifications all go to the same place, I already have to decide whether to use Hangouts or Facebook Messenger when talking to basically anyone anyway. I also think people should push a little harder to move conversations over from SMS to something else, I've never found that to be very difficult. mxwp SMS is convenient because you know it will work with any American with a cell phone... including "dumb" flip phones. And it actually is really difficult to get people to switch to another service. Apple users just use imessage to send their SMS to me. And then I send them my glorious green bubbles and those ishills can suck it. YaKillaCJ Sms integration is important because it is supported by 100% of telecommunications service providers and integrated on all devices that can make a phone call and has a screen. You can even sms a home phone without a screen depending on carrier/service provider. Thus it messaging that works with 100% of your contacts. Having multiple Apps spread across 100s of contacts is plain annoying. So if any App wants to be taken serious, it needs to be serious and have sms. What's App already fills the void for bypassing sms across the globe. rndusrnm479461 This answer makes the most sense. Thanks. Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi! play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi We're still new and young but we're very serious about our ambitions and not settling when we know it could/should be better. To fix texting on Android, we provide transparent switch between SMS&IM (devices handshake when you get into chats so that we determine whether you or the recipient has poor reception and should prefer SMS for example). Very handy in some countries/areas/events. And lets you reach *anybody* (that has a phone number). My name is…. Nobody uses SMS no more, and if i wanna send a text message to the last of the Mohicans, i will use my SMS app. I dont want no stupid integration and no stupid 'SMS fallback' that will make things worse. Chatting is not texting. YaKillaCJ There are only 2 widely used methods of messaging across mobile devices. Sms and What's App. Sms is supported on EVERY device from 2 way pagers and flip phones to house phones and smartphones. Any device that has a phone number supports sms. The majority of people doesn't care about added features like stickers and gif. We just care that all I need is the person phone number and from there I can call or text them. That's it. Bottom line is that it has to be a standard adopted by carriers on a worldwide scale. Hence what's app reason for such large scale use is it uses existing phone numbers for login, existing phone book for contact list, free, minimum data usage and encrypted. Even that is still not even used by a third of the devices that use sms. Ryuuie Last I checked, WhatsApp charged $1 or someshit. erptastic It has not done that officially for years. And even before that, they always just extended my account. disqus_Xz3y8OiO3O It's free mxwp in the larger scheme of things, I agree with you that it is not a big deal. still, having one app do both was convenient. the other complaint is Android fanboys being envious of iMessage, which Hangouts could have become. exadeci The main reason that people use Imessage is that you get rich messaging capabilities out of the box if the person you are talking to has an Iphone everything is abstracted, you add someone's number and you start chatting right aways no need to exchange accounts id's or find which app you both use. And if the other doesn't have an Iphone you can still message them or if you killed your data plan it sends an sms. But Google doesn't add sms support because they are pushing for RCS which is a GOOD thing: Standalone Messaging 1-to-1 Chat Group Chat File Transfer Content Sharing Social Presence Information IP Voice call Best Effort Video call Geolocation Exchange Audio Messaging Network based blacklist Capability Exchange based on Presence or SIP OPTIONS All this WITHOUT using any data, data needs an link to be established this doesn't. Chris Hannan It's not hard for most of us to use it. The problem is the people we contact don't want to use separate apps. Everyone with iPhones uses iMessage because it just works by default. But barely anybody I know uses Hangouts and nobody I know uses Allo. If it was all built into one app that shipped with Android phones, more people would use it. Troy Leonard and I removed Hangouts as of today I will no longer consider using any google messaging service ever again Sruly J Isn't Gmail a form of messaging? (Or do you not use Gmail?) Troy Leonard Not for long I'm transitioning over to outlook.com. And upgrading my phone to an iPhone. I'm sick of slow to no updates on my phone,and done with Google ruining everything I ever liked about their apps and Android. naysayer Good riddance. Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi), a new app that we're making that brings a lot of the goodies iMessage brings to iOS users, with big long-term ambitions, and still trying to preserve a consistent and sleek UI. Hopefully that will make you stick to Android and you'll make your iPhone friends jealous in a few months/years ;) Zsolt V Why bother evangilizing? He already decided Outlook on an iPhone is better than Gmail, so let him enjoy it. Troy Leonard Your link is broken Adrien Aubel Fixed thanks! Disqus didn't like the closing ')' at the end of the link. XgudwilX eww outloook😲 Total Insecurity Saying "upgrading my phone to an iPhone" is the same as converting from atheism to any religion. Just a downgrade. bekifft It's true, and their failings and obvious ulterior motives in messaging have, for the first time in a decade, made me consider moving my email back to a private service over which I have control. Roy Thank you and have a nice flight. -Matoro Zeliph- Just want to make sure I'm not missing anything. So Google Voice SMS will no longer work too? Corbin Davenport That will still work as well. Ryne Hager Google voice will still work, just like Fi. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ It's primarily that regular SMS will no longer function in the app. A while back they killed of threading of SMS/MMS and Hangout messages, and now they are killing SMS/MMS entirely out of the app and suggestin people to switch to Android Messages. Bill Blandford Hangouts SMS looks like it still works for Google Voice SMS too. Essentially, this is like Fi, which is a Google Voice number at heart. My wifi-only-device kids use Hangouts to call and text with a Google Voice #. Timmy Turner Yeah GV will continue to work through Hangouts since the number you use via Project-Fi is a GV given number. Adrien Aubel For people that were still using Hangouts and want to try a new app that also does SMS & IM, that tries to provide a fast & polished experience to fix texting on Android, I'd love some honest feedback! https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi We're trying hard to "make it right" and have so much planned on the roadmap, so any feedback is great to have to tweak things up. Let us know what you think! exadeci While the initiative is nice, why would we use your messaging app? If I want an instant message app that does sms and that no one else uses I already got Signal and at least Signal is proven to be secure. What makes Messenger (Facebook), WhatsApp and Imessage good? Their userbase. Ask anyone for a way to communicate and they will use one of those apps, no need for fallback sms when everyone has an account. Adrien Aubel Thanks for your feedback @exadeci:disqus! Great questions :) And Signal is nice as well! It's not for everybody but if you're happy with it keep using it but make sure to check us out in a few months to check that you haven't been missing out, we're going fast! I think there's much more to iMessage that makes it good than their userbase. It is a polished app that just works, and lets you reach anybody, therefore becoming your trusted "go to" texting app. We expect Google to release this summer new capabilities that will let you use IM in more scenarios. Very interesting stuff that we can't wait to let our users benefit from. But our initial target is actually SMS users, people that unlike you and I don't really care about the details, they just want a reliable app that sends and receive their messages. And they're actually quite happy with SMS/MMS in that regard, it just works (when you don't fight with APNs, something we try to prevent as well). We want to transparently "upgrade" those users that may be using Android Messages or a 3rd party app custom-made for the carrier or OEM, not necessarily developed with great care and polishment, and sometimes truly terrible (really, you wouldn't believe what's on some popular carriers, that most users end up using 10 times a day for years). Right now invi is mostly upgrading the transport of your messages and general experience as we develop another big focus of ours: bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages exchanged being plain text. Texting can be the most impersonal way of communication and this flattens relationships. A bar suggests as you type relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps you transmit how you truly felt when writing this message, it doesn't flatten as much your emotions (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). It always send instantly over IM as well (no upload or anything like that, optimized WebP images for super-fast download). Open your top 3 chats on Signal, chats that you have with people you care the most about, look at all this flat plain texting, and try to visualize the gap compared to what it could be, how it could have been more personal and transmitting more of your feelings or emotions. We're targeting this gap, and again, we're just getting started but have serious ambitions and motivation. If you use Snapchat, look at all that rich media that gets thrown to your eyes or that you throw to people, that doesn't always make sense and is often disconnected from conversations, sometimes losing its value and feeling like you just threw a bottle in the ocean, just leaving you with a list of who saw it. We're looking at that gap as well, as invi becomes more and more rich in terms of content creation. After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. We are in talks with some OEMs and resellers to make invi default which would help grow invi's user base and help us improve our product with more diverse usage, while some upcoming features of invi should ultimately help us get a lot more users naturally. exadeci Signal has actually Gifs from Giphy, stickers and the possibility to send a location but I don't use this kind of feature even on Messenger it's quite rare that I send a sticker. Google is strongly pushing for RCS adoption which would add all these emotions sharing: https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Rogers_Google_RCS.gif https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Telenor_6P_GIF_0UHHQdI.gif https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/RCS_Android_Update.width-600.png Adrien Aubel Exactly, but how relevant is Giphy? Again don't compare with things you've seen so far but with what it could potentially be if it truly understood your relationships and intentions, if it combined that with your taste and the way you usually communicate with this specific person. And what if your friends or other people were able to add their own media and stickers through channels and then be discovered, liked and followed, with deep intelligence powering it all and bringing the right content to the right user? We built invi to support all this, we don't just use a Giphy API, we used the most advanced and lightweight technologies to communicate in realtime with our backend, even on pretty bad 3G, from where we curate the media that eventually gets recommended to you. The screenshots you attached look great as well, but see Android Messages is a good example there's only 5 packs of stickers that won't get more relevant or smarter no matter how many stickers you use or how many times you use Android Messages. Idk who would use a given sticker hundreds of times, but anyway I'm not sure those were really representative of how Android Messages is most commonly used. The features are technically there, as often, but they're very limited in their potential as of now. The Awesome Bar isn't for everyone but can eventually help people like you, as images just get displayed while you're typing, no action required, and if you see one that you like you can just tap it to see how it looks and enrich your message, send and you're done. Google is pushing RCS, very true! And we're excited about the great work the Jibe team did in the past couple years. They're a bit shy to share their RCS client implementation at the moment, it may be unstable or not well documented at the moment, but we're meeting regularly with Google and hope to add RCS to our transparent switch as soon as possible, even though the user base is a bit limited at the moment it has the potential to grow fast and solve many issues. If they're reluctant for too long we may use other hubs that would communicate seamlessly through Unified Profile. But for now, we're watching the number of users actually benefiting from RCS grow while we focus on other areas of improvements. sam1331 I am actually kind of optimistic about all this, more so than I was maybe a year ago. They've been putting out a steady stream or improvements to Allo, and when I've experimented with it with a friend it actually is an enjoyable experience. Releasing it without a web app is just shocking, but if that's added and it works well, I could totally see moving over to it from Hangouts, where I do the vast majority of my communicating. The other piece of the puzzle is Duo. If they can integrate a Duo button in Allo conversations (like it seems they will), and they eventually add group calling, which can't be that far off, then I think it will be a nice solution for myself and my family. And I've got quite a few friends that are all about Android instead of iOS, so I can see them switching to Allo from Hangouts. But not until there is a web app, because they aren't stupid. Chad Knasinski I would use Allo if they added SMS support and a desktop version like Hangouts had. Nick.Trite Same here. I have Fi so I'll continue to use Hangouts for SMS. I really love the fact that I can switch seamlessly from desktop to mobile and still be sending SMS. Until Allo does that, I won't consider moving. Chad Knasinski Ditto Sir_Brizz And multi-device support. Can't even use it or sync it on my LTE Tablet... Carson Saldanha So, basically Hangouts but revamped? We've come in full-circle. Sir_Brizz Sure. The problem is that every other chat platform has these features in 2016. Including Hangouts. Roy Me to, love it. mxwp unless they remove hangouts from gmail, people will still secretly be using "hangouts" all the time. in fact, the only way Allo will ever take off without SMS is if it replaces Hangouts (gtalk) on gmail and inbox. Chad Knasinski So correct me if I am wrong here but Google wants us to do this with our messages: SMS - Google Messenger Business SMS - Hangouts Messages - Allo Facebook - Messenger Video Chat - Duo Business Video Chat - Hangouts Video Really? Are you kidding me here? Timmy Turner You've got it right and if there's a joke, you'll being waiting a while for the punchline. disqus_em5YfkbWdk What Business SMS and how is 8t different from other SMS? Zsolt V What does Facebook have to do with anything you wrote? So you are corrected. SpadeX Are you new to tech world? Timmy Turner I recommend Textra to anyone looking for a new SMS app. Sleek, customizable and continually updated/supported. Adrien Aubel Textra is very nice, notably customization-wise as you said, you can go deep and fine-tune basically any UX element. And it's super fast and lightweight as well. I am working as well on a new SMS app that also provides IM similarly to iMessage on iPhone, and many other features, most of them upcoming though. Would you mind giving me a honest feedback when you have the time? It's called invi on the Play Store https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi Timmy Turner Sure thing. freshprince_87 That invi SMS app is an awesome app. Near flawless app. but I stop using it because I kept having problems with MMS messages and also it just like Allo in the sense where if you uninstall the app and reinstall it on the same phone all your instant messages are all gone including some of the regular SMS /MMS messages. You need to make the app save all your messages on to an account like a Google account in the cloud. So that no matter what device you use the instant messages will still be there. Adrien Aubel @freshprince_87:disqus Thank you for your feedback! MMS can be very tricky and every carrier has its own set of specificities, I'm sorry about that, it shows we're still young but obviously like you said, such a core functionality bug makes our whole effort worthless for you here. Do you mind sharing your carrier, device model, and Android version? Did you try using "Legacy MMS" in the app settings? About the IM sync, that's an issue we're definitely looking into, considering all potential security and privacy issues, notably as some countries like USA recycle pretty aggressively your phone numbers, and with the desire to bring a Web client in mind. Google should announce this summer APIs that will eventually help us regarding security, so stay tuned :) freshprince_87 Thanks. I didn't use the legacy MMS. I hope that you add the IM sync soon. I'm on a T-Mobile service using the Moto Z Play on Android Nougat 7.0 Adrien Aubel Ok thank you, if you don't mind I have other questions to dive into your problem :) What specifically was failing? MMS sending, receiving, or both? Did it show an error? Is it only on group MMS or all MMS? Whatever information you may have will be helpful. Our next release should bring MMS reliability improvements and notably Wifi texting when supported by the carrier (first MMS may send up to 60s to send as we're trying out routes but then all other Wifi MMS should send very fast). Tom Westrick https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5ecvBaqHBk MJ Thank God I use Project Fi otherwise this would suck big time for me. TJ Mills Thank God I have Google voice.... Dracono Love hangouts never used SMS. It also seems most negative reviews about it being slow was always tired to the SMS feature. I'm now curious with the removal of they'll us the opportunity to evolve or let it idle. mxwp it will evolve into a business app... but hopefully still available for consumers VAVAMk_2 Just give us SMS support in Allo for Christ's sake! Adrien Aubel SMS/MMS can be quite hard to deal with technically and Google didn't choose to go that way. It is possibly also due to the push they did to replace the default SMS app on many OEMs and carriers, strategically it's hard for them to push much of Google's agenda through the SMS app they give carriers, and they're mostly limited to SMS/RCS. Roy Christ will not give you SMS, bat Star of David could promise you RCS in Allo. mxwp Big G repeatedly stated it would never happen tim242 Liar. Adrien Aubel https://twitter.com/amitfulay/status/840236304130428928 Roy Great. It's was the plan all along. Now Allow will get RCS and web browser everything gonna integrate with Duo. I'm all the way in. I never like Hangout. I love Allo. #stop stop babies don't you cry. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I don't think that's possible. RCS is still mainly just an extension of SMS. If it doesn't support SMS, I don't see it handling RCS. Roy When RCS will come it will be with SMS already. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Based on what? Besnik Rrustemi No problem guys,we have like 69 other Messaging Apps by Google to choose from and maybe 2 new others coming soon. Roy Haha it's so old. Can someone can come with new jokes here? Besnik Rrustemi Well sorry Old Man then, never knew your age before. * Respect for Old People * Sir_Brizz Let the confusion officially begin! Indianajonze google can go fk themselves Robert Gerhart Why isn't anybody asking the bigger question: why the hell does anyone use outdated SMS in the first place? It's like complaining that Hangouts doesn't integrate butter churns and wagon wheels either. There is nothing more annoying than a text message. Adrien Aubel SMS is always nice to have in some situations, that happen more or less depending on where you live. Uncovered areas, concerts or big games, people having no LTE-enabled plans, or simply on some roads and highways. In USA for example all those scenarios happen a lot, notably in some states. And eventually, in most countries you still use SMS for 3rd party services, banks, transportation, or even government-related messages. Most importantly, in countries that still use SMS you can reach *anybody you know* from one app. And that's really a great thing to have. Now you're right, IM is so much more pleasant. Instant delivery, read status, last active time, way faster image format and transport. At invi ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi ) we try to take advantage of this and combine both the way it should be. When you open a chat with somebody, we trigger a handshake to check that both you and the recipient are well connected. If one of both doesn't answer on time, it simply switches to SMS/MMS, it's automatic and out of your way. Otherwise you take advantage of state-of-the-art transport with some unique optimizations. Try to send a GIF over IM and see how fast it goes, compared to MMS or even Whatsapp. Let me know what you think! Aaron Simple; SMS is ubiquitous. Every cellular device in operation can send and receive SMS, from the most current and expensive flagships like the iPhone and Galaxy, to the cheapest budget devices, all the way down to the oldest flip phones. I can text my dad on his flip, my wife on her Nexus or my Capt on his iPhone and each one will receive that message and reply. Show me an IM that can do all of that (that isn't on the iPhone). I guess that invi app that guy's been pedaling might, but I'm waiting for it to gain some traction before trying to convince anybody to switch to yet another IM. Rod The rest of the world uses Whatsapp, everyone has it installed. JG Even people with generic flip phones? Rod Nope, but I don't remember the last time I saw someone with a flip phone. The poor now bear Galaxy Win/Pocket/etc JG My aunt still has one. She recently attempted to upgrade to a smartphone but that seems to have failed big time... Apparently my telling her to tap the icon that's labeled "EMAIL" to get her email is too complicated... That and the free phone she got is a PoS... 512MB of RAM and only 4GB of storage - with the OS consuming all but like 100MB there of. So it didn't perform quite so hot. She seemed a bit surprised her free phone didn't perform as well as my Pixel XL does... TJ Mills Everyone in China uses Wi chat. Rod USA is a world apart. lomsha Believe it or not, even 2g is still a luxury in some countries, which makes​ instant messaging iffy. In those cases sms is a great alternative. Not everyone is in the 1st world with a sweet smartphone and reliable data access. TJ Mills Standard is better than better. When someone comes up with a universal replacement that works on all classes of phones, then the world can switch. Until then it's a mishmash of services and applications​to communicate. Why does everyone still use email? Because of the standards. Michael Sørensen Convince me why I shouldn't... Currently I can write to anyone for free without first asking them what their preferred platform is. And they can reply for free regardless of said preferred platform. Again, convince me why that's not good enough? And don't say "stickers". Just don't. Security? Bah, no sensitive information sent. Midnitte At this point, I'm held hostage stuck using Hangouts since it's the only thing that natively supports desktop messaging. Sigh. Lord Argyris "Each has its disadvantages, though. The latter doesn't have quite the same feature set that Hangouts did, and the former is a Facebook product." It's lines like these that keep.me coming back to AP. JD My support for Google and their messaging platforms ended the beginning of May. Kelly Clubb Well this sucks for any user that enjoyed an easy to use sms app. I use Hangouts and thankfully for project fi will continue it's support BossMa1n3 Eh..doesn't effect me stop using hangout for sms awhile ago..more interested in a flat screen phone with side bezels as thin as the one in the pic.. Grey PLEASE Bring Hangouts Chat and Hangouts Meet to all users. That has so many new and awesome features. It's like everything Allo isn't. DragoCubed The comment section is rough b_boogey_xl Bye Hangouts! hp-fourtwenty oh ffs...voice is still supported??? hell yeah!! nxtiak I'm waiting for the day G+ contacts disappear from Hangouts. I hate how on PC when I type a name to start a conversation it lists random people on G+. SHOW ME THE NAMES FROM MY DAMN CONTACTS GOOGLE!!!!!!!!! Maave RIP Hangouts. I had group chats, Google Voice, and SMS all in one. Now my group chats have moved to Telegram but I'm still stuck with nerfed Hangouts for GV.

At this stage, Amazon’s Alexa is so far ahead in the AI assistant game, it’s basically Beyonce to Google Assistant’s Kelly and Apple Siri’s Michelle. But if there’s one thing Apple has, it’s lots of money to throw at something to make it a success. And all the signs point to that something being a Siri-powered smart speaker to take on the Amazon Echo and Google's fledgling Home. Numerous patent filings have pointed to Apple working on a prototype for some time, and the latest rumours suggest an announcement could happen at Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference, better known as WWDC, which takes place in San Jose from June 5–9, 2017. How does Apple go about toppling Amazon from the top of the home automation tree? Here are six things it needs to do.  1) OUT-DESIGN THE COMPETITION The Amazon Echo and Google Home are perfectly acceptable little home hubs, but they respectively look like a Bluetooth Speaker and an air freshener. Apple's specialist subject on Mastermind is still product design, and we'd love to see its minimalist flair applied to a stunning piece of home furniture. In other words, something a lot better than its 'milk crate' iPod Hi-Fi from 2006.  Could it be donut-shaped, like the company’s new Silicon Valley headquarters? Perhaps there'll be a built-in screen to match the Amazon Echo Show? Or will it mirror the alluringly curvaceous form of the Mac Pro? Our money would be on the latter, but there's no doubt Apple's design has been hit-and-miss in recent years - so it'll need to rediscover its best form to trump the more established Echo and Home.  2) MAKE SOME SIRI-OUS IMPROVEMENTS It's easy to forget how far Apple's Siri was ahead of the voice assistant game when it launched with the iPhone 4S in 2011. Back then, being able to ask your phone for the weather was a neat trick, even if it did still embarrassingly start playing Chris Rea's 'Auberge' when you asked it for moussaka ingredients. These days, Google and Amazon have both leapfrogged Apple, and Siri lags behind the competition both in terms of voice recognition and the things it can do. Apple needs to give Siri a major update, and there's every reason to expect it will - the iPhone 8 will benefit from a revamped voice assistant in iOS 11, and Apple recently made some interesting bespoke Siri content for the Apple Watch. Voice assistants are shaping up to be the new capacitive touchscreens, so a Siri Speaker will need to do more than just play catch up to its rivals. 3) WORK SEAMLESSLY WITH HOMEKIT Some of our favourite Alexa tricks are asking her to turn up the heating, switch off lights, and voice control our home entertainment system. It's harder to do the same on the iPhone because HomeKit is still lacking wide support - for example, none of our smart home gear from Sonos, Hive or Logitech Harmony works with HomeKit. Apple needs to get this interconnectivity sorted if it's launching a smart speaker of its own. The Amazon approach, where manufacturers build an Alexa app or "skill", works well. The HomeKit method, meanwhile, sees Apple force certain standards on manufacturers to meet before they ship their product. Apple needs to start working with a wider selection of companies to make sure they work with the Siri Speaker at launch. 4) ARRIVE WITH AN AFFORDABLE SIBLING Apple would do well to offer a couple of Siri speaker options — one premium offering for those who want to use it to play music, and another for those who just want to use it as a way to interact with their smart home. Of course, the Apple advantage is that nearly every device it currently sells is both web-connected and has a microphone and speaker, so any improvements made to Siri for a dedicated speaker could also roll out to iPhones, iPads, Apple TVs and Macs. With Apple traditionally reluctant to take the entry-level route, this could be its solution to the ubiquity conudrum. 5) DELVE DEEPER INTO YOUR LIFE One thing Google does better than Apple is figuring out what you’re doing and providing you with context-sensitive information. For example, letting you know something you ordered is going to be delivered soon, or that your flight is running late, or that traffic is going to affect your journey. Apple’s Siri does some of this stuff, but not nearly as intelligently or comprehensively. Siri needs deeper links into your email and calendar (with users’ permission, of course) in order to start accessing that data, and then a better AI to make sense of the information. 6) WIDEN ITS MUSICAL TASTES OK, based on Apple’s previous form of locking you into its own services, this might be a stretch, but we hope the Siri Speaker plays nicely with more than just Apple Music. The Amazon Echo and Google Home both let you choose Spotify as the default player to respond to your "Play me some Iron Maiden" request, rather than just tying you to Amazon Music or Google Music.   Apple is likely to pair exclusively with Apple Music for its Siri Speaker, but we’d love to see more services offered, or at least connections to other speakers like Sonos — a feature we’ve been waiting for from the Amazon Echo for months.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 23 May 2017 | MYT 7:30 AM No rainbow-puking unicorns: How Google wants to dominate the future of computing by janko roettgers The Lens name clearly sets Google's image-recognition efforts apart from Snapchat's and Facebook's. Both companies are also investing massively into AI and image recognition – but the way these efforts are reaching consumers couldn't be different. — Reuters LOS ANGELES: First, computers were better at playing chess and Go than humans. Now, they're beating us at something as fundamental as looking at things.  Case in point: Google CEO Sundar Pichai revealed at the company's Google I/O developer conference in Mountain View this week that his company's computers have surpassed humans at recognising objects in images.  That's why users of Google's mobile software will soon be able to point their phone camera at a flower, and instantly get Google's assistant to look up the name of the plant. Point it at a restaurant, and get reviews of it. Or – and this got the most cheers out of Pichai's geeky audience at Google I/O – point it at the password sticker on the back of a router, and have their phone use that data to log into the WiFi network.  "We are clearly at an inflection point with vision," Pichai said.  Google's CEO talked about this inflection point as part of a bigger transition for his company, and the world of technology in general. Google began its life a web search engine, focused on making computers and the internet easier to use. Then came mobile, and Google had to adapt. "Mobile made us reimagine every product we were working on," said Pichai.  Now, a new generation of devices and services – including voice-activated speakers like Amazon Alexa and Google Home, but also phone cameras and virtual and augmented reality headsets – are redefining everything once more. "Computing is evolving again," he said. "We now have voice and vision as two new important modalities for computing."  Google announced its new image-recognition efforts Wednesday under a new project name, Google Lens. Pichai said that Lens-powered technology will first come to Google Assistant and Google Photos in the coming months, and find its way to additional Google products in the future.  Accident or not, the Lens name clearly sets Google's image-recognition efforts apart from Snapchat's and Facebook's. Both companies are also investing massively into artificial intelligence and image recognition – but the way these efforts are reaching consumers couldn't be different.  Snapchat's lenses, and Facebook's filters, allow consumers to add rainbow-puking unicorns and animated birthday cakes to their photos and videos. Admittedly silly stuff, but Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg made a convincing case during his company's recent f8 developer conference arguing that there is more to it.  Facebook in particular has been using advanced image-recognition technologies powered by artificial intelligence to recognise and isolate objects in those pictures. And while consumers post, share and remix billions of silly photos, Facebook's algorithms are busy crunching in the background, using them as training data to get better at image recognition and augmented reality.  Zuckerberg said that his audience was looking to use phone cameras and visual effects to make augmented reality mainstream. "We are going to make the camera the first augmented-reality platform," Zuckerberg said.  Google has no rainbow-puking unicorns. It clearly is working on the same problems, and also loves to collect data and train its algorithms, but does so with a Google-ish twist. Instead of being fun, it wants to be useful – even if that means that pundits call it boring.  The company is also busy chipping away on other parts of the problem, including voice recognition – an area that Facebook has thus far eschewed. And there are clear areas of overlap between advancements at Facebook, Google and other companies. The most obvious example for this is virtual reality, where Google will soon compete even more aggressively with Facebook's Oculus by launching a standalone VR headset.  But Google is also playing in a league of its own, something that became evident when Pichai announced that the company is now building servers and datacentres focused on artificial intelligence that are being made available to other companies as part of its Google Cloud platform. And if that wasn't enough, Google is even working with phone makers to bring chips optimised for artificial intelligence to future Android phones.  These kinds of chips will make it possible for future phones to get even better at voice and object recognition, and enable all kinds of far-out augmented and mixed-reality applications. You know, things that make rainbow-puking unicorns seem outright boring. — Reuters Related Stories You May Be Interested Ex-IBM employee from China pleads guilty to code theft charges Symantec says ‘highly likely’ North Korea group behind ransomware attacks The evolution of mobile phones Coway promotes a healthy lifestyle When the CEO is your mentor 10 after work habits for personal success Others Also Read Hypermart rewarding customer loyalty Go Thai for a change Family forced to live under flyover advertisement Latest News US top court tightens patent suit rules in blow to ‘patent trolls’ China’s troubled LeEco said to plan cutting most of US workers Apple, Visa face patent infringement lawsuit over Apple Pay Ford names Hackett as CEO to tackle car rivals, Silicon Valley Symantec says ‘highly likely’ North Korea group behind ransomware attacks Most Viewed in Tech Symantec says ‘highly likely’ North Korea group behind ransomware attacks Apple, Visa face patent infringement lawsuit over Apple Pay China’s troubled LeEco said to plan cutting most of US workers China scrambles to tame bike chaos China’s LeEco founder cedes control of listed unit amid cash crunch Ford names Hackett as CEO to tackle car rivals, Silicon Valley Google cosies up to China with AI secrets and a game of Go Sharkwatching: With more sharks and better tech, it’s the latest craze EU to conclude Google antitrust cases in next few months US top court tightens patent suit rules in blow to ‘patent trolls’ Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)
Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 23 May 2017 | MYT 8:30 AM University and Google hope to use patterns in patient records to predict health by lisa schencker Dr Gary Steinberg (middle) and Nisha Kumar (left) talking with patients at the University of Chicago Medicine's Duchossois Centre for Advanced Medicine. U. of C. and Google are teaming up to research ways to use machine learning to predict medical events. — Chicago Tribune/TNS CHICAGO: As a patient, your electronic medical record contains a wealth of information about you: vital signs, notes from physicians and medications.  Doctors use that information to track your medical history and keep tabs on you in the hospital – but what if they could also use it to predict your future health?  It's an idea inching closer to reality.  This week, Google announced it's teaming up with University of Chicago Medicine to research ways to use machine learning to predict medical events – such as whether someone will be hospitalised, how long that hospitalisation will last and whether a patient's health is deteriorating. Google has formed similar partnerships with Stanford Medicine and the University of California at San Francisco.  Google and university researchers will try to discover patterns in patients' medical records but the records used in the research will be stripped of personally identifiable information to protect patient privacy.  "There's so much health care data, especially with electronic health records being adopted over the last 10 years," said Katherine Chou, who's leading the project for Google Research. "The potential for using that data for predictions, people haven't really figured out how to harness it."  University of Chicago Medicine has spent years working on ways to use data to predict health events. Researchers developed an algorithm called eCART that uses patient data to predict cardiac arrest, and if a patient is high-risk, nurses will perform extra checks on the patient. University of Chicago already uses eCART on its adult patients.  Dr Michael Howell, the medical centre's chief quality officer, said he's confident eCART has helped reduce instances of cardiac arrest, but he said researchers are still collecting data on its effectiveness.  The partnership with Google will help expand on such work, said Dr Samuel Volchenboum, director of the Centre for Research Informatics at University of Chicago Medicine.  Chou said Google team members met the University of Chicago's Howell at a Harvard University medical training programme, and Google saw how its ability to organise data and make it accessible could apply in health care.  It's too early to tell whether Google could potentially develop a product or service using the technology, Google spokesman Jason Freidenfelds said in an email. At this point, Google is focused on demonstrating that the approach can improve patient care, he said.  Chicago company Quant HC has already commercialised eCART, selling it to hospitals, including Amita Health Alexian Brothers Medical Centre and some of NorthShore University HealthSystem's hospitals, said Dr Dana Edelson, who helped develop eCART at the University of Chicago and is now CEO of Quant.  "If you do more preventative care, then you have a win-win situation," Chou said. — Chicago Tribune/Tribune News Service Related Stories You May Be Interested US top court tightens patent suit rules in blow to ‘patent trolls’ Ex-IBM employee from China pleads guilty to code theft charges The evolution of mobile phones Coway promotes a healthy lifestyle When the CEO is your mentor 10 after work habits for personal success Others Also Read Working hard to serve commuters Go Thai for a change Family forced to live under flyover advertisement Latest News US top court tightens patent suit rules in blow to ‘patent trolls’ China’s troubled LeEco said to plan cutting most of US workers Apple, Visa face patent infringement lawsuit over Apple Pay Ford names Hackett as CEO to tackle car rivals, Silicon Valley Symantec says ‘highly likely’ North Korea group behind ransomware attacks Most Viewed in Tech Symantec says ‘highly likely’ North Korea group behind ransomware attacks Apple, Visa face patent infringement lawsuit over Apple Pay China’s troubled LeEco said to plan cutting most of US workers China scrambles to tame bike chaos China’s LeEco founder cedes control of listed unit amid cash crunch Ford names Hackett as CEO to tackle car rivals, Silicon Valley Google cosies up to China with AI secrets and a game of Go Sharkwatching: With more sharks and better tech, it’s the latest craze EU to conclude Google antitrust cases in next few months US top court tightens patent suit rules in blow to ‘patent trolls’ Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

The new platform, which is being delivered through the existing Prime Video app, allows customers to select from more than 40 on-demand TV channels. These include Discovery, hayu, MGM and Amazon's own curated Bollywood channel Heera. Unlike many other services which require users to purchase broad packages with access to dozens of networks, Channels lets users subscribe to however many or few they want. Each channel has a unique monthly subscription fee, and doesn't require a contract. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below In typical Amazon style, the channels are available via a single click. Prices of the various channels vary between £1.49 for cooking channel Panna, to more expensive channels like Sweatflix, which offers "HIIT workouts and yoga flows for £9.49 a month". ©  Amazon Prime Most content delivered through Channels will also be available to download to watch on demand. New customers will be able to access free trials "for the majority of subscriptions". Users of Prime Video can easily move between Channels and other Prime Video content like American Gods, as they're delivered by the same app. The Channels service has already launched in the US, and provides access to HBO, Showtime and Cinemax – a more appealing list of headliners than the UK version. "For the first time, Prime members in the UK and Germany will be able to choose to watch premium TV channels without having to sign up to a bundle or a contract, giving them the freedom to pay for only what they want to watch," said Alex Green, head of Amazon Channels in Europe. "From live sport to Bollywood, arthouse cinema to reality TV, and award-winning TV shows from popular channels like Discovery and ITV, Amazon Channels gives power back to customers to choose exactly what they want to watch." Amazon says the current lineup, which includes entries like the sailing-focused Nautical Channel, and Gaia, a yoga and nutrition focused channel, is set to expand over the coming months.

SMS support for Hangouts officially ends today, excluding Google Voice and Project Fi subscribers Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/22 2:29pm PDTMay 22, 2017 64 Plus 1 on G+ 177 Share on Facebook 77 Share on Twitter Total Shares318 Applications Google News Videos Today is the day that Hangouts finally loses SMS support. We were warned by Google about it months ago when Hangouts started showing a warning that it would no longer support the feature. But, as of today, it's finally set to happen. For anyone that isn't on Project Fi or Google Voice — both of which will continue to support SMS in Hangouts — this is the end of an era. Many people, myself included, made the final push into Hangouts over other services when SMS support was added. The integrated conversations made it much easier to keep short communications together in one place. So far there's no word on if SMS support will be coming to Allo. Now that Hangouts support for SMS is finally over, we aren't really left with a clear migration method. Anyone that might have made use of it will have to either deal with using two separate apps again or move over to a new service. If you are looking for recommendations, Google's stock Android Messages isn't so bad. But, if you've been enjoying having SMS and chats merged, that isn't really a solution. Allo is always an option. But, that's the same issue from the other side, you'd still need to find a way to send SMS messages. There's always Facebook Messenger or Signal, which both provide a combined SMS and chat solution. Each has its disadvantages, though.  The latter doesn't have quite the same feature set that Hangouts did, and the former is a Facebook product. Either way, it's closing time.

Total Insecurity You know, buddy...? I never get it if you are just joking/lying or just clever and funny. Your name makes it pretty difficult to differentiate! Roy Me to crappy app. mxwp not even when you were checking your gmail on the computer and someone sent you a instant message? PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Never had the occasion. Cool story though: I was going to take a screen showing no archives, no "buddies" or whatever, and I see my wife has sent me a bunch of stickers (don't see a date, though). which is a surprise becauyse she's an iPhoner and I didn't even know she had Hangouts. Now I like Hangouts just as they EOL it! TechGuy22 LOL 4Ui812 Google hangouts ... The only place where people never hanged out . cadtek91 *hung Ryne Hager Dunno, don't remember seeing anyone get hanged either. Even if we all got left out to dr-WHY GOOGLE, WHY?! JVF When referring to people it is always "Hanged", sounds funny but that's just how it is. It's a past participle. Ryne Hager Yup, I know. That was the joke. 4Ui812 I understand what you're saying and I debated the proper way to put it..... I have to stand by hanged. instinct I am like 6 different active group chats in Hangouts. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Google doesn't care about you. humulos A truer statement has never been said Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2c9aad5a41d09ce24c4c4e04e7b3a28a2004487ff015df2fc519b5c2a9556024.gif Adrien Aubel Google's messaging strategy is now: - Android Messages for carriers & OEMs - meaning strictly SMS/RCS - Allo for their new consumer messaging service, and the focus of their upcoming work - Hangouts for business/enterprise Nothing personal :) humulos How innocent we once were, at the time when we witnessed Talk, Voice, SMS and G+ Messages become a single product, fulfilling all our dreams. Undone in naught but a few years, with this final limb being ripped from the body. But I guess I'm on Project Fi, so I'm good for now. My parents weren't happy about this news, since our family communicates primarily on large Hangouts threads. mxwp but if they are using actual Hangouts IM threads and not SMS they can still use Hangouts Adrien Aubel IMHO those big plans haven't been followed by strict coding/design rules, and Hangouts became progressively a technical mess, then a true nightmare for anybody to work on, with the UI becoming slower with each version, fortunately partly compensated by faster phones. To be fair, SMS/MMS can be very complicated to deal with, and Android development was much harder and potentially messy when Babel has been developed, the technologies available nowadays would have helped a lot. So down the road it would have been neither productive or future-proof to keep iterating all efforts inside Hangouts, at least without a total recode from the ground up. Right now I wonder if they will indeed clean the code up to remove all carrier SMS/MMS, and eventually speed up the app and make it smaller, or just roughly disable it. t_newt If Hangouts became a technical mess, the solution isn't to drop Hangouts, it's to fix Hangouts. They could have made it a framework for their products that any of their messengers could be installed into. Instead they are trying to make it an enterprise Slack competitor. What company is going to trust their company to Google's leftovers? "SMS/MMS can be very complicated to deal with". Apparently this is true at Google. Duder12 They aren't getting the left overs. They are getting two brand new products. Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat. My name is…. Nobody ever used Hangouts for SMS outside America. Actually, nobidy uses SMS no more. There DOES exist a world outside America, you know, and its much bigger!! sproc Haha, you wish. Everyone I know is stuck on sms. They try whatsapp and stuff then abandon it. Adrien Aubel Especially iOS users, who already have a great "Messages" app that outsmarts SMS when possible. For them it doesn't make too much sense to download another messaging app every now and then. Rodrigo Gomes da Silva So.. where are you from? Jay No you wish, but you must be in the states. No one i know uses SMS anymore. It's an archaic dead service, only used for bank transaction notifications and amazon deliveries. Everyone else is either on whatsapp (yes 220 million of us in this country and growing at 4 million a month) or (wechat which is like what 85-90 percent of China) No one cares for SMS. TheDrunkenClam What an unnecessarily smug and nagging comment. Winston Well it's true, even if it's smug. Outside the US, SMS is pretty much dead as we've all moved towards WhatsApp, as carriers still don't give unlimited texts by default. I think it's time to start asking another company for SMS integration. Christopher Gannon That would work if so many people in the US weren't using iMessage, where the only way a non-apple user can chat is via SMS. Then apple makes it very difficult NOT to use it, so good luck convincing your friends to give up siri, etc. I'd also like a solution, like hangouts or iMessage, where messages aren't restricted to a phone, and I can seamlessly use both on my laptop, tablet or phone. Ryan Yes, but we still have all of the money. Magister Good for them. I live in us and everyone uses sms, so that's what I use. What everyone else uses is moot. Michael Sørensen Nonsense. I'm not in the US (Europe) and the VAST majority in my country still use SMS. Jason Hirsch I was very annoyed at having to add Hangouts as my SMS client. I couldn't keep separate separate anymore. Now in combination with Fi, GV, 2 phones and obi it's a nightmare. On this overseas trip i couldn't force Fi to dial via WiFi. So i had to go back and install Hangouts dialer. If they (Google) have a master plan there's no rhyme or reason to it. atc-tech Google Voice users should still be able to use it too, I think? I don't know. I switched the the updated GV app when it came out around the same time the hangouts DEintegration was announced, so I'm not sure, but I think Voice users still can... Aaron Berlin Who knows what the plan is long-term for GVoice in Hangouts, but the actual GVoice app is actually good now. No equivalent to the chrome extension/desktop app, though. Ryne Hager You are right, Google Voice users can also continue to receive SMS messages in the app, I'll make that more clear. atc-tech Cool. I wasn't sure GV still could, but I thought I remembered hearing that we could. I gave up already though and use the prettier new GV app... Wish they would add back more features though. Ryne Hager The new app is so pretty. I do wish my GV voicemails would show up in my call logs again, though. mxwp i exclusively use my GVoice number for calls and texts and use it on Hangouts. the update GVoice app has an annoying bug in that it tries to connect every account on your phone instead of just your main one. i have submitted it as a bug but have not heard anything back Tom Harman So when does Allo officially get SMS support, lol. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Same time it gets tablet support: Never. rndusrnm479461 Am I the only one who doesn't understand what's so good about SMS integration in either Allo or Hangouts? Is it really hard for you people to use 2 apps? Jesus christ. Google's "Android Messages" is lightweight anyway, why is it such a problem to use it? It shouldn't even eat much RAM. Kyle Gospodnetich Yes, yes you are. Please never work for Google, or really any company that has a hand in communications. My name is…. No, he is not Kyle Gospodnetich Congrats, now there's two of you idiots. iluvthesoftsoft One do-it-all app > two apps Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi, https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi, we're trying to fix texting on Android and provide transparent switch between SMS&IM (devices handshake when you get into chats so that we determine whether you or the recipient has poor reception and should prefer SMS for example). MJ Two apps? One app for SMS and than Facebook, WhatsApp, Allo/Hangouts, and whatever to cover all my contacts. SMS is the only thing I can message 100% of my contacts with. Adrien Aubel Google's messaging strategy is now: - Android Messages for carriers & OEMs - meaning strictly SMS/RCS - Allo for their new consumer messaging service, and the focus of their upcoming work - Hangouts for business/enterprise They can't risk to upset carrier and OEMs by implementing non-carrier features in Android Messages / the default SMS app they provide. Or at least it's a risk they're not ready to take at that time. Btw I wouldn't say "Android Messages" is that lightweight btw, notably on modern devices it could be so much smoother :( sam1331 I don't get it either. When Android Messages came out I switched my SMS over to it. I quickly realized I was using it almost exclusively for 2 factor verification codes. But really, the notifications all go to the same place, I already have to decide whether to use Hangouts or Facebook Messenger when talking to basically anyone anyway. I also think people should push a little harder to move conversations over from SMS to something else, I've never found that to be very difficult. mxwp SMS is convenient because you know it will work with any American with a cell phone... including "dumb" flip phones. And it actually is really difficult to get people to switch to another service. Apple users just use imessage to send their SMS to me. And then I send them my glorious green bubbles and those ishills can suck it. YaKillaCJ Sms integration is important because it is supported by 100% of telecommunications service providers and integrated on all devices that can make a phone call and has a screen. You can even sms a home phone without a screen depending on carrier/service provider. Thus it messaging that works with 100% of your contacts. Having multiple Apps spread across 100s of contacts is plain annoying. So if any App wants to be taken serious, it needs to be serious and have sms. What's App already fills the void for bypassing sms across the globe. rndusrnm479461 This answer makes the most sense. Thanks. Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi! play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi We're still new and young but we're very serious about our ambitions and not settling when we know it could/should be better. To fix texting on Android, we provide transparent switch between SMS&IM (devices handshake when you get into chats so that we determine whether you or the recipient has poor reception and should prefer SMS for example). Very handy in some countries/areas/events. And lets you reach *anybody* (that has a phone number). My name is…. Nobody uses SMS no more, and if i wanna send a text message to the last of the Mohicans, i will use my SMS app. I dont want no stupid integration and no stupid 'SMS fallback' that will make things worse. Chatting is not texting. YaKillaCJ There are only 2 widely used methods of messaging across mobile devices. Sms and What's App. Sms is supported on EVERY device from 2 way pagers and flip phones to house phones and smartphones. Any device that has a phone number supports sms. The majority of people doesn't care about added features like stickers and gif. We just care that all I need is the person phone number and from there I can call or text them. That's it. Bottom line is that it has to be a standard adopted by carriers on a worldwide scale. Hence what's app reason for such large scale use is it uses existing phone numbers for login, existing phone book for contact list, free, minimum data usage and encrypted. Even that is still not even used by a third of the devices that use sms. Ryuuie Last I checked, WhatsApp charged $1 or someshit. erptastic It has not done that officially for years. And even before that, they always just extended my account. disqus_Xz3y8OiO3O It's free mxwp in the larger scheme of things, I agree with you that it is not a big deal. still, having one app do both was convenient. the other complaint is Android fanboys being envious of iMessage, which Hangouts could have become. exadeci The main reason that people use Imessage is that you get rich messaging capabilities out of the box if the person you are talking to has an Iphone everything is abstracted, you add someone's number and you start chatting right aways no need to exchange accounts id's or find which app you both use. And if the other doesn't have an Iphone you can still message them or if you killed your data plan it sends an sms. But Google doesn't add sms support because they are pushing for RCS which is a GOOD thing: Standalone Messaging 1-to-1 Chat Group Chat File Transfer Content Sharing Social Presence Information IP Voice call Best Effort Video call Geolocation Exchange Audio Messaging Network based blacklist Capability Exchange based on Presence or SIP OPTIONS All this WITHOUT using any data, data needs an link to be established this doesn't. Chris Hannan It's not hard for most of us to use it. The problem is the people we contact don't want to use separate apps. Everyone with iPhones uses iMessage because it just works by default. But barely anybody I know uses Hangouts and nobody I know uses Allo. If it was all built into one app that shipped with Android phones, more people would use it. Troy Leonard and I removed Hangouts as of today I will no longer consider using any google messaging service ever again Sruly J Isn't Gmail a form of messaging? (Or do you not use Gmail?) Troy Leonard Not for long I'm transitioning over to outlook.com. And upgrading my phone to an iPhone. I'm sick of slow to no updates on my phone,and done with Google ruining everything I ever liked about their apps and Android. naysayer Good riddance. Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi), a new app that we're making that brings a lot of the goodies iMessage brings to iOS users, with big long-term ambitions, and still trying to preserve a consistent and sleek UI. Hopefully that will make you stick to Android and you'll make your iPhone friends jealous in a few months/years ;) Zsolt V Why bother evangilizing? He already decided Outlook on an iPhone is better than Gmail, so let him enjoy it. Troy Leonard Your link is broken Adrien Aubel Fixed thanks! Disqus didn't like the closing ')' at the end of the link. XgudwilX eww outloook😲 Total Insecurity Saying "upgrading my phone to an iPhone" is the same as converting from atheism to any religion. Just a downgrade. bekifft It's true, and their failings and obvious ulterior motives in messaging have, for the first time in a decade, made me consider moving my email back to a private service over which I have control. Roy Thank you and have a nice flight. -Matoro Zeliph- Just want to make sure I'm not missing anything. So Google Voice SMS will no longer work too? Corbin Davenport That will still work as well. Ryne Hager Google voice will still work, just like Fi. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ It's primarily that regular SMS will no longer function in the app. A while back they killed of threading of SMS/MMS and Hangout messages, and now they are killing SMS/MMS entirely out of the app and suggestin people to switch to Android Messages. Bill Blandford Hangouts SMS looks like it still works for Google Voice SMS too. Essentially, this is like Fi, which is a Google Voice number at heart. My wifi-only-device kids use Hangouts to call and text with a Google Voice #. Timmy Turner Yeah GV will continue to work through Hangouts since the number you use via Project-Fi is a GV given number. Adrien Aubel For people that were still using Hangouts and want to try a new app that also does SMS & IM, that tries to provide a fast & polished experience to fix texting on Android, I'd love some honest feedback! https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi We're trying hard to "make it right" and have so much planned on the roadmap, so any feedback is great to have to tweak things up. Let us know what you think! exadeci While the initiative is nice, why would we use your messaging app? If I want an instant message app that does sms and that no one else uses I already got Signal and at least Signal is proven to be secure. What makes Messenger (Facebook), WhatsApp and Imessage good? Their userbase. Ask anyone for a way to communicate and they will use one of those apps, no need for fallback sms when everyone has an account. Adrien Aubel Thanks for your feedback @exadeci:disqus! Great questions :) And Signal is nice as well! It's not for everybody but if you're happy with it keep using it but make sure to check us out in a few months to check that you haven't been missing out, we're going fast! I think there's much more to iMessage that makes it good than their userbase. It is a polished app that just works, and lets you reach anybody, therefore becoming your trusted "go to" texting app. We expect Google to release this summer new capabilities that will let you use IM in more scenarios. Very interesting stuff that we can't wait to let our users benefit from. But our initial target is actually SMS users, people that unlike you and I don't really care about the details, they just want a reliable app that sends and receive their messages. And they're actually quite happy with SMS/MMS in that regard, it just works (when you don't fight with APNs, something we try to prevent as well). We want to transparently "upgrade" those users that may be using Android Messages or a 3rd party app custom-made for the carrier or OEM, not necessarily developed with great care and polishment, and sometimes truly terrible (really, you wouldn't believe what's on some popular carriers, that most users end up using 10 times a day for years). Right now invi is mostly upgrading the transport of your messages and general experience as we develop another big focus of ours: bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages exchanged being plain text. Texting can be the most impersonal way of communication and this flattens relationships. A bar suggests as you type relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps you transmit how you truly felt when writing this message, it doesn't flatten as much your emotions (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). It always send instantly over IM as well (no upload or anything like that, optimized WebP images for super-fast download). Open your top 3 chats on Signal, chats that you have with people you care the most about, look at all this flat plain texting, and try to visualize the gap compared to what it could be, how it could have been more personal and transmitting more of your feelings or emotions. We're targeting this gap, and again, we're just getting started but have serious ambitions and motivation. If you use Snapchat, look at all that rich media that gets thrown to your eyes or that you throw to people, that doesn't always make sense and is often disconnected from conversations, sometimes losing its value and feeling like you just threw a bottle in the ocean, just leaving you with a list of who saw it. We're looking at that gap as well, as invi becomes more and more rich in terms of content creation. After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. We are in talks with some OEMs and resellers to make invi default which would help grow invi's user base and help us improve our product with more diverse usage, while some upcoming features of invi should ultimately help us get a lot more users naturally. exadeci Signal has actually Gifs from Giphy, stickers and the possibility to send a location but I don't use this kind of feature even on Messenger it's quite rare that I send a sticker. Google is strongly pushing for RCS adoption which would add all these emotions sharing: https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Rogers_Google_RCS.gif https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Telenor_6P_GIF_0UHHQdI.gif https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/RCS_Android_Update.width-600.png Adrien Aubel Exactly, but how relevant is Giphy? Again don't compare with things you've seen so far but with what it could potentially be if it truly understood your relationships and intentions, if it combined that with your taste and the way you usually communicate with this specific person. And what if your friends or other people were able to add their own media and stickers through channels and then be discovered, liked and followed, with deep intelligence powering it all and bringing the right content to the right user? We built invi to support all this, we don't just use a Giphy API, we used the most advanced and lightweight technologies to communicate in realtime with our backend, even on pretty bad 3G, from where we curate the media that eventually gets recommended to you. The screenshots you attached look great as well, but see Android Messages is a good example there's only 5 packs of stickers that won't get more relevant or smarter no matter how many stickers you use or how many times you use Android Messages. Idk who would use a given sticker hundreds of times, but anyway I'm not sure those were really representative of how Android Messages is most commonly used. The features are technically there, as often, but they're very limited in their potential as of now. The Awesome Bar isn't for everyone but can eventually help people like you, as images just get displayed while you're typing, no action required, and if you see one that you like you can just tap it to see how it looks and enrich your message, send and you're done. Google is pushing RCS, very true! And we're excited about the great work the Jibe team did in the past couple years. They're a bit shy to share their RCS client implementation at the moment, it may be unstable or not well documented at the moment, but we're meeting regularly with Google and hope to add RCS to our transparent switch as soon as possible, even though the user base is a bit limited at the moment it has the potential to grow fast and solve many issues. If they're reluctant for too long we may use other hubs that would communicate seamlessly through Unified Profile. But for now, we're watching the number of users actually benefiting from RCS grow while we focus on other areas of improvements. sam1331 I am actually kind of optimistic about all this, more so than I was maybe a year ago. They've been putting out a steady stream or improvements to Allo, and when I've experimented with it with a friend it actually is an enjoyable experience. Releasing it without a web app is just shocking, but if that's added and it works well, I could totally see moving over to it from Hangouts, where I do the vast majority of my communicating. The other piece of the puzzle is Duo. If they can integrate a Duo button in Allo conversations (like it seems they will), and they eventually add group calling, which can't be that far off, then I think it will be a nice solution for myself and my family. And I've got quite a few friends that are all about Android instead of iOS, so I can see them switching to Allo from Hangouts. But not until there is a web app, because they aren't stupid. Chad Knasinski I would use Allo if they added SMS support and a desktop version like Hangouts had. Nick.Trite Same here. I have Fi so I'll continue to use Hangouts for SMS. I really love the fact that I can switch seamlessly from desktop to mobile and still be sending SMS. Until Allo does that, I won't consider moving. Chad Knasinski Ditto Sir_Brizz And multi-device support. Can't even use it or sync it on my LTE Tablet... Carson Saldanha So, basically Hangouts but revamped? We've come in full-circle. Sir_Brizz Sure. The problem is that every other chat platform has these features in 2016. Including Hangouts. Roy Me to, love it. mxwp unless they remove hangouts from gmail, people will still secretly be using "hangouts" all the time. in fact, the only way Allo will ever take off without SMS is if it replaces Hangouts (gtalk) on gmail and inbox. Chad Knasinski So correct me if I am wrong here but Google wants us to do this with our messages: SMS - Google Messenger Business SMS - Hangouts Messages - Allo Facebook - Messenger Video Chat - Duo Business Video Chat - Hangouts Video Really? Are you kidding me here? Timmy Turner You've got it right and if there's a joke, you'll being waiting a while for the punchline. disqus_em5YfkbWdk What Business SMS and how is 8t different from other SMS? Zsolt V What does Facebook have to do with anything you wrote? So you are corrected. SpadeX Are you new to tech world? Timmy Turner I recommend Textra to anyone looking for a new SMS app. Sleek, customizable and continually updated/supported. Adrien Aubel Textra is very nice, notably customization-wise as you said, you can go deep and fine-tune basically any UX element. And it's super fast and lightweight as well. I am working as well on a new SMS app that also provides IM similarly to iMessage on iPhone, and many other features, most of them upcoming though. Would you mind giving me a honest feedback when you have the time? It's called invi on the Play Store https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi Timmy Turner Sure thing. freshprince_87 That invi SMS app is an awesome app. Near flawless app. but I stop using it because I kept having problems with MMS messages and also it just like Allo in the sense where if you uninstall the app and reinstall it on the same phone all your instant messages are all gone including some of the regular SMS /MMS messages. You need to make the app save all your messages on to an account like a Google account in the cloud. So that no matter what device you use the instant messages will still be there. Adrien Aubel @freshprince_87:disqus Thank you for your feedback! MMS can be very tricky and every carrier has its own set of specificities, I'm sorry about that, it shows we're still young but obviously like you said, such a core functionality bug makes our whole effort worthless for you here. Do you mind sharing your carrier, device model, and Android version? Did you try using "Legacy MMS" in the app settings? About the IM sync, that's an issue we're definitely looking into, considering all potential security and privacy issues, notably as some countries like USA recycle pretty aggressively your phone numbers, and with the desire to bring a Web client in mind. Google should announce this summer APIs that will eventually help us regarding security, so stay tuned :) freshprince_87 Thanks. I didn't use the legacy MMS. I hope that you add the IM sync soon. I'm on a T-Mobile service using the Moto Z Play on Android Nougat 7.0 Adrien Aubel Ok thank you, if you don't mind I have other questions to dive into your problem :) What specifically was failing? MMS sending, receiving, or both? Did it show an error? Is it only on group MMS or all MMS? Whatever information you may have will be helpful. Our next release should bring MMS reliability improvements and notably Wifi texting when supported by the carrier (first MMS may send up to 60s to send as we're trying out routes but then all other Wifi MMS should send very fast). Tom Westrick https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5ecvBaqHBk MJ Thank God I use Project Fi otherwise this would suck big time for me. TJ Mills Thank God I have Google voice.... Dracono Love hangouts never used SMS. It also seems most negative reviews about it being slow was always tired to the SMS feature. I'm now curious with the removal of they'll us the opportunity to evolve or let it idle. mxwp it will evolve into a business app... but hopefully still available for consumers VAVAMk_2 Just give us SMS support in Allo for Christ's sake! Adrien Aubel SMS/MMS can be quite hard to deal with technically and Google didn't choose to go that way. It is possibly also due to the push they did to replace the default SMS app on many OEMs and carriers, strategically it's hard for them to push much of Google's agenda through the SMS app they give carriers, and they're mostly limited to SMS/RCS. Roy Christ will not give you SMS, bat Star of David could promise you RCS in Allo. mxwp Big G repeatedly stated it would never happen tim242 Liar. Adrien Aubel https://twitter.com/amitfulay/status/840236304130428928 Roy Great. It's was the plan all along. Now Allow will get RCS and web browser everything gonna integrate with Duo. I'm all the way in. I never like Hangout. I love Allo. #stop stop babies don't you cry. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I don't think that's possible. RCS is still mainly just an extension of SMS. If it doesn't support SMS, I don't see it handling RCS. Roy When RCS will come it will be with SMS already. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Based on what? Besnik Rrustemi No problem guys,we have like 69 other Messaging Apps by Google to choose from and maybe 2 new others coming soon. Roy Haha it's so old. Can someone can come with new jokes here? Besnik Rrustemi Well sorry Old Man then, never knew your age before. * Respect for Old People * Sir_Brizz Let the confusion officially begin! Indianajonze google can go fk themselves Robert Gerhart Why isn't anybody asking the bigger question: why the hell does anyone use outdated SMS in the first place? It's like complaining that Hangouts doesn't integrate butter churns and wagon wheels either. There is nothing more annoying than a text message. Adrien Aubel SMS is always nice to have in some situations, that happen more or less depending on where you live. Uncovered areas, concerts or big games, people having no LTE-enabled plans, or simply on some roads and highways. In USA for example all those scenarios happen a lot, notably in some states. And eventually, in most countries you still use SMS for 3rd party services, banks, transportation, or even government-related messages. Most importantly, in countries that still use SMS you can reach *anybody you know* from one app. And that's really a great thing to have. Now you're right, IM is so much more pleasant. Instant delivery, read status, last active time, way faster image format and transport. At invi ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi ) we try to take advantage of this and combine both the way it should be. When you open a chat with somebody, we trigger a handshake to check that both you and the recipient are well connected. If one of both doesn't answer on time, it simply switches to SMS/MMS, it's automatic and out of your way. Otherwise you take advantage of state-of-the-art transport with some unique optimizations. Try to send a GIF over IM and see how fast it goes, compared to MMS or even Whatsapp. Let me know what you think! Aaron Simple; SMS is ubiquitous. Every cellular device in operation can send and receive SMS, from the most current and expensive flagships like the iPhone and Galaxy, to the cheapest budget devices, all the way down to the oldest flip phones. I can text my dad on his flip, my wife on her Nexus or my Capt on his iPhone and each one will receive that message and reply. Show me an IM that can do all of that (that isn't on the iPhone). I guess that invi app that guy's been pedaling might, but I'm waiting for it to gain some traction before trying to convince anybody to switch to yet another IM. Rod The rest of the world uses Whatsapp, everyone has it installed. JG Even people with generic flip phones? Rod Nope, but I don't remember the last time I saw someone with a flip phone. The poor now bear Galaxy Win/Pocket/etc JG My aunt still has one. She recently attempted to upgrade to a smartphone but that seems to have failed big time... Apparently my telling her to tap the icon that's labeled "EMAIL" to get her email is too complicated... That and the free phone she got is a PoS... 512MB of RAM and only 4GB of storage - with the OS consuming all but like 100MB there of. So it didn't perform quite so hot. She seemed a bit surprised her free phone didn't perform as well as my Pixel XL does... TJ Mills Everyone in China uses Wi chat. Rod USA is a world apart. lomsha Believe it or not, even 2g is still a luxury in some countries, which makes​ instant messaging iffy. In those cases sms is a great alternative. Not everyone is in the 1st world with a sweet smartphone and reliable data access. TJ Mills Standard is better than better. When someone comes up with a universal replacement that works on all classes of phones, then the world can switch. Until then it's a mishmash of services and applications​to communicate. Why does everyone still use email? Because of the standards. Michael Sørensen Convince me why I shouldn't... Currently I can write to anyone for free without first asking them what their preferred platform is. And they can reply for free regardless of said preferred platform. Again, convince me why that's not good enough? And don't say "stickers". Just don't. Security? Bah, no sensitive information sent. Midnitte At this point, I'm held hostage stuck using Hangouts since it's the only thing that natively supports desktop messaging. Sigh. Lord Argyris "Each has its disadvantages, though. The latter doesn't have quite the same feature set that Hangouts did, and the former is a Facebook product." It's lines like these that keep.me coming back to AP. JD My support for Google and their messaging platforms ended the beginning of May. Kelly Clubb Well this sucks for any user that enjoyed an easy to use sms app. I use Hangouts and thankfully for project fi will continue it's support BossMa1n3 Eh..doesn't effect me stop using hangout for sms awhile ago..more interested in a flat screen phone with side bezels as thin as the one in the pic.. Grey PLEASE Bring Hangouts Chat and Hangouts Meet to all users. That has so many new and awesome features. It's like everything Allo isn't. DragoCubed The comment section is rough b_boogey_xl Bye Hangouts! hp-fourtwenty oh ffs...voice is still supported??? hell yeah!! nxtiak I'm waiting for the day G+ contacts disappear from Hangouts. I hate how on PC when I type a name to start a conversation it lists random people on G+. SHOW ME THE NAMES FROM MY DAMN CONTACTS GOOGLE!!!!!!!!! Maave RIP Hangouts. I had group chats, Google Voice, and SMS all in one. Now my group chats have moved to Telegram but I'm still stuck with nerfed Hangouts for GV.

If you want the most relevant stories delivered to your phone in the shortest possible time, we've got the apps for you. Image: Gizmodo You can pick up news apps of all shapes and sizes for Android and iOS, but here we've tried to focus on the candidates that excel in one particular area: breaking news. That means push notifications that surface the stories most relevant to your interests, and delivered as fast as possible. The number of alerts you get varies depending on how you configure each app, but having carried these apps around for a couple of days, both AP Mobile and News360 are the most consistent for throwing up news stories that are just breaking, with the AP app best for local news stories (if you've set local news stories up). Each of these apps has their merits though, so we'd recommend trying out a few to see which ones work best for your news taste. Nuzzel Image: Screenshots Nuzzel scans what your friends on Twitter and Facebook are sharing and uses that as an indicator of what news you might want to hear about. The app's ability to filter news headlines based on their timeliness as well as their popularity on your social graph is handy. in general, Nuzzel doesn't show alerts for as many stories as other apps, but when something big is breaking on Facebook or Twitter, it seems to do the best job at showing the news first. Indeed, the app's breaking news alerts consistently impressed us with their speed and relevance. Additionally, you can customise the threshold used to trigger a breaking news alert as well as limit the number of push notifications you get a day in the app settings. Nuzzel (free) for Android and iOS Google Now Image: Screenshots Google Now or the Google app or whatever you want to call the service (it varies based on who you ask and which platform you're on) isn't the most advanced news app in the world but it is smart. (One advantage of letting Google track you just about everywhere is that it does a good job of working out which news stories you're going to want to read.) You can turn on push notifications for news (and traffic updates and the weather) from inside the app settings, and we've seen numerous timely headlines appear while we've been using the Google Now launcher that comes on stock Nexus phones. It's less aggressive on iOS, but you can still configure push alerts on the news you want. Google (free) for Android and iOS Flipboard Image: Screenshots Everyone's favourite mobile magazine maker is also useful for breaking news alerts too, and you can either tap into the shared knowledge of your social media feeds or rely on Flipboard to ping you regularly based on the topics of your choosing. The app was recently redesigned so flicking through your curated stories works more smoothly than ever. You don't get all that much control over which stories prompt alerts and how often they come through, but there's an impressive level of customisation when it comes to the topics that Flipboard pulls together for you, and a host of news sources to pore through. When you're ready to read something, the interface is hard to beat. Flipboard (free) for Android and iOS AP Mobile Image: Screenshots A lot of news outlets pull their stories from the Associated Press wire anyway, so why not go straight to the source? The new organisation's app design won't win any beauty contests, but when it comes to getting notifications relevant to your interests, the AP is killer. AP Mobile doesn't tap into your social feeds and doesn't even require any kind of registration, so it's a more straight-up take on the day's news, sorted into the categories or the parts of the world you specify. Inside the app settings you can set up a 'quiet time' when you won't be buzzed by whatever breaking news story is about to hit the headlines. AP Mobile (free) for Android and iOS News360 One of the more venerable news apps out there, News360 has been treading the beat for a while now, but still comes up with the goods if you're after fresh, relevant news headlines pushed straight to your phone. It's one of the best at sifting the genuinely important stories from the rest, and you can go pretty specific in terms of news topics. News alerts can be switched on or off for certain categories, if you want push notifications on tech news but not sports scores, and there is the option to link your Facebook and Twitter for a more personalised feed, though this isn't essential. You can like or dislike stories you read too, which means News360 learns more about what you want over time. News360 (free) for Android and iOS Squid Image: Screenshots Squid is worth checking out for the way it blends standard features like topic selection with more innovative touches, including the option to annotate articles with text and scribbles before sharing them with your contacts. The special reader mode for articles is friendly on the eyes too. You don't get much control over the push notifications the app sends out, so you're relying on the curation you've already done inside the app in terms of sources, but we found Squid did a decent job at keeping us up to date with happenings across the world. Squid (free) for Android and iOS WATCH MORE: Tech News Comments w0rt3x Guest May 23, 2017, 1:45pm Twitter? Reply 0 panther_mime @panther_mime May 23, 2017, 2:17pm You made the statement staying on top of breaking news is more important than ever. That's utter rubbish, where is the proof for a statement like that? What is the reason to be the first to know any given bit of news? 95% of news I see is so mundane I wish I didn't see it so I definitely don't care enough to be the first to know. I wish there was a website that only had the news you should know, the stuff that you might actually want to do something about. Reply 0 Join the discussion!

Educational Technology May 22, 2017 Google Adds Safety Feature to Android Gmail App After E-Mail Phishing Attack Filed under: Educational Technology — admin @ 12:35 am By Sri Ravipati, THE Journal A word of warning: If there is an e-mail in your inbox asking you to open a Google Doc from someone, don’t open it. A day after the recent attack, Google rolled out a new safeguard to its Android Gmail app. The phishing scam attempted to hack a user’s Google account after the user clicks a link that appears to be from a trusted individual. Google was able to stop the attack after about 1 million (just 0.1 percent) of all Gmail users had seen one of the e-mails. Now with the Gmail app updates, when a phony link appears in an e-mail, Google will warn the user, with an alert: “The site you are trying to visit has been identified as a forgery intended to trick you into disclosing financial, personal or other sensitive information.” https://thejournal.com/articles/2017/05/04/google-adds-safety-feature-to-android-gmail-app-after-email-phishing-attack.aspx Share on Facebook Comments Off No Comments No comments yet.

Google may be sued over Nexus 6P early shutdown and bootloop issues Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:09am PDTApr 14, 2017 130 Plus 1 on G+ 319 Share on Facebook 84 Share on Twitter Total Shares533 Android OS Legal Marshmallow 6.0 News Nexus 6P The Android hardware space is fast beginning to look like a watered down episode of Suits. Following on from news earlier in the week that LG is facing a bootloop lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

Matthew Hanson Mine seems to love to die around 10%. As a few others have stated, the low power notification will appear, I will use it for a few minutes and then it powers off. The battery history shows this steep cliff falloff after beginning the recharging and power on. Melad360 i always saw my 6p shut off as soon as the power saving mode came on at 15% battery. this started to happen after an update, i think 7.0 or 7.1, never happened before that though Latheryin This really is a software issue with what they ship out to nexus devices. It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment. Latheryin Sorry not a baby sitter. Why not do some research before you post. Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. Đức Thành Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February. ThEGr33k Which country? Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost. Funnily enough that is not a software issue 12321 Please click the links below for details of my experience, which is echoed by thousands of other Nexus 6P owners.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Artūras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Jeremy Miethker that means its going to bootloop soon. that is what happened to me Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jeremy Miethker my brothers replacement phone already went into bootloop 5 days after receiving it. my phone died last week. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ARDankar I am glad I did not upgrade to nougat yet. Keep me posted on any news regarding issues with the Nexus 6P. David Droddy The Goog replaced my 6P very quickly when I demonstrated the sudden shut down problem even in safe mode and after full factory reset. Why would you report that Google is not responsive to this issue? Seanmiz Yep, I've experienced both issues on my 6P. I got hit with the bootloop of death a few months ago, luckily still under warranty with Huawei and got a replacement. I get the early battery shutdown usually in the 10-20% range. prwnd https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cd48abb593ae6c1dd226cbe06ba45cf7195abd40318303b2290ca9229846939e.png Biojoe Me too. Travis Coble Oddly enough, sometimes it shuts down early, and sometimes it's fine. However, given my use of it and constant recharging, I'm convinced that this will end up going nowhere because the problem is actually pretty normal for devices that are going on two years of age due to the use of LIon batteries. People claiming shutdown at 60%? I'd need to see it to believe it... maverick7526 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3b98bc27cfb84fed5d59d503e403949c6d1cd50a18f37dd23dc58235aba80ad6.png It happens. It happened to me in Feb. It was very cold out and the phone just shut off, and would not turn on again until it was plugged into a charger. Brett Crowley Mine just hit a random boot loop and recovery mode is not working. Jeremy Miethker once it bootloops there is nothing you can do. it is now a cool paper weight Hussain Ahmadi I really hope they sue google for this. 6P keeps restarting without any reason, not to forget the excessive freezing issues. Google is getting very arrogant and need some spanking Hussain Ahmadi And of course this will be the last phone I've ever buy from google. Waiting eagerly for Note 8 mercado79 Yes, both issues. The battery issue was covered under warranty directly by Google. The bootloop issue occurred 1 month out of warranty and both companies told me there​ was nothing they could do for me. Marcin Nowak I had this issue since beginning of the year and Google forums just said wait for update. Finally contacted Google about it just last week feed up asking for help and they told me to F.off pretty much. zefred Got it. It started RIGHT after the one year mark. Contacted google AND Huawei, and was turned down by both. My N6p doesn't even last half a day with recharging. I need to carry extra external batteries everywhere with me, as well as a charge and cable, and the device is barely a year and a half old. NOT a happy camper :( 12321 Law360, Dallas (April 17, 2017, 5:29 PM EDT) -- Google Inc. and Huawei Technologies USA Inc. were hit with a putative class action in Texas federal court Friday over an allegedly defective smartphone, the Nexus 6P, which the user claims suffers from premature battery drainage. Plaintiff Alex Gorbatchev wants to represent a class of consumers who bought the Google Nexus 6P phones, which he says also suffer from a problem that sends the phone into a “death spiral” in which the phones suddenly switch off and then restart in what is referred to as an... https://www.law360.com/texas/articles/913933/class-hits-google-with-suit-over-defective-nexus-phones https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bad-Cellphones.pdf Claude L Now it's getting worst with android 7.1.2. I was also experiencing early shutdown with my 6p when using 7.1.1. But now I'm unable to use my phone on a daily basis without having a early shutdown. Today again battery was at 20% and last week it happened at 37%. I was so happy when I bought my phone a year and a half ago because I was able to use it for the whole day without having to charge the battery... Now I have to carry a charger with me... It sucks theadb Anything we can do in Canada? Mine just shuts off randomly all the time. This is was a RMA from an older 6P that had massive battery issues. The guy I just spoke to said my original warranty was up in January this year and there was nothing he could do. This phone shuts down randomly all the time now. I've missed by alarm to wake up twice now because it just shuts off. Only way to power it back on is to go into bootloader and restart. adi sararu mine had his 20% dying today first time... and after reading above... my time to never touch google phones again :D Steve I had same battery problem with my 6p, rather than taking out a lawsuit against Google I just purchased a new battery and replaced it. Phone no longer has the issue, lawsuit closed Kyle Snider Phone shuts off early on me allllllll the time, does this lawsuit affect us in Canada? Adam Macias I'm suffering the premature battery death. I have yet to cross the boot loop issue though. God help me if I do. Jeremy Miethker well im a not so proud owner of a $800 dollar paper weight. i cant believe how this is being handled they want me to spend $550 to replace it than they will reimburse me. are you kidding me. however was wondering if this would happen again if i did get a new one? Jacob Lunsford My 6P shuts down with anywhere from 10-30% battery remaining. pi app my problem is the uber driver app stopped working on this phone about 2 weeks ago (same app was working fine on this phone for last 8 months). when i log into uber driver app on any other fine it works fine. a chinese person told me because huawei is a chinese company and they hate uber they may have done something to prevent the app from working on their phones. i was going to buy another nexus 6p to see if same problem occurs. then i will know. my battery's been fine with my phone. Svart Adam Solander My phone shutdown at around 20-25%. Quite annoying. sleepytinksy Also have this issue - phone shut down right before the gates opened for a soccer match and they only issued digital tickets, scan-able on the phone. As you can imagine, that was less than ideal. Panda without dark circle My 6p shut down at 35% or below when I travel to Japan on winter, I thought it was because of the cold. But when I back to Malaysia, it shut down at 60% or below, not every time but this scared me. :( And yes, it doesn't warning me at all, shut down without any sign. Ahmad Zaib I am from India and facing the same issue on my Nexus 6P. The Huawei customer care response has been that they are coming up with an official response soon. This has been the status since more than 3 weeks now. Anyone here, who knows what can we expect here or how do we proceed? Tom Z 71% (seventy-one percent) Shutdown! Mine just hit a new low (or high) with this issue. I just had mine shut down at 71% (seventy-one percent) remaining battery life. This is a very big problem. I was taking pictures when the phone just went into shut down. I couldn't get it to stay running until I connected power. This needs to be fixed! I'm on the latest version with April 2017 security updates. Tom boses Same issue here. I'm reaching the shutdown at about about 38% mark! I'm frustrated at Google's inaction! Jay Miller Mine has died anywhere from 43% to 15%. It is random battery percentage for the shutdown, but it always claims it is at 15% then shuts down. The minute you plug it in and turn it on, the battery percentage is what it really shut off at, and it is usually in the high 20's. So yesterday I tried something. I went to the factory images I had for my Nexus, and through ADB, I sent it "back in time" to Android 6.0 (original release firmware). I then put it to the test. I turned on the hotspot and started playing games that I know drain the battery. I got the warning at 15%....no shutdown. I continued further. I got a warning at 14%, at 12%, 10%, 5% and eventually it shutdown at 1%. I placed it on the charger and fired it up and it was "truly" at 1% battery. I haven't seen it fully drain in months. While the claim that new batteries work, it also appears that Google has work to do on their end as well. Reversing the firmware did work for me. However, the device wanted to update immediately. I accepted the security patch, but at this point in time I will refuse to upgrade back to Nougat if I can gain the full use of my phone without it shutting off prematurely. Here is my log: Firmware I was on 05/03/2017 at 11 AM Eastern US time: N2G47H (April 2017 Security Patch) Firmware I reversed it to on 05/03/2017 at 12 PM Eastern US time: MDA89D (September 2015) Firmware after accepting most recent security patch OTA on 05/03/2017 at 6:45 PM Eastern US time: MTC19T (Android 6.0.1 but security is May 2016) Mister Sonny I'm having the early shutdown issue, for me it's consistently at around 25% battery life. This is made worse by the fact that I have an accessory almost always connected (Fitbit Blaze) NumbGrip I've been having this problem since about 6 weeks ago and it started completly out of nowhere Vince Romeo I've encountered the boot loop problem on 6p after <18 mo. Occasionally sudden shutdowns before that happened. My wife's phone is ~19+ and has sudden shutdown issues. Darshan Jain I am facing the same bootloop issue and my phones warranty has expired and Huawei and Google refused to help Shailla Chand My phone will be fresh off the charger at 100% and shut down within 15 minutes. Talk about frustrating.. Gerbil My 6p has been losing power at alarming rate always with Android system and Android OS at the top. Then it began randomly shutting down an demanding to be charged after sending a notification my battery hit 0% when I was well above 40% and failed to detect my SIM card for about 3 hours. I down own a power bank so I'm really suffering here as my phone dies midday and I can't use it for the latter half of the day. chesterbr Now that you mention... I (a no-bootloop-but-frequent-shutdown-at-30% Nexus 6P user) had a couple failures on SIM card detection. Not sure how long they lasted, removing and reinserting seemed to have done the trick... keeps one wondering... :-/ rpeltz My Nexus 6p shuts down when the battery drops below 49 percent. This can happen in as little as an hour of idle time and the phone is just over 1 year old. Cassy Forrester I had the shut off issue. It was shutting off at 99% after a couple of weeks of only shutting off at 48% and below. Still ridiculous. Anyway, I bought it through Newegg so I had to deal with huawei.. biggest fucking pain in the ass. We waited 22 days for a shipping label. Called on a thursday and they said by Monday it would be emailed. Still didn't come. Called again and they said another few days. Didn't come. Called AGAIN and after 5 hours of being on the phone (that day alone.. 15 hours total), they sent the email with the label. I sent it in and like 4 business days later it was returned.. same phone I sent it.. doesn't shut off anymore.. BUT they told us it was a software issue and that they couldn't fix the phone so they would have to replace it. Clearly they didn't replace it but it doesn't shut off so that's good right? Well no. Now my phone is not charging if I use it while it's on the charger... Also, I get the warning when it boots that it can't be checked for corruption. Fuck these people. Fuck this phone. My warranty was up by the time they sent the label but they did say they are taking phone's after warranty because they are having so many issues with this phone.. (also why they took so long to help me) Well no wonder they're taking them! They are only half ass fixing them. So if a half ass fix is worth it to you, call them. They might help. This is the US in case that helps. iRulLezZ My 6p shutted down with full battery and restarted all the time ! Nothing happes ! Pghgeek My 6p has the issue. Powers off before battery is low. Won't tun back on until connect to a charger then shows 40 to 60% battery. Have to use another phone. Don Smith My 6p purchased 11/2015 has been the most fantastic phone i've ever had but hey. Now i noticed that i never get the battery saver time. Then i researched. my phone is shutting down at 56% batter. Of course there is no warning that this is coming. So it's only useful if i'm plugged in at home, the car or traveling with my anker battery pack, Thank you anker. My exeperience with trying the warranty once is that it's worse than worthless. Details for file a clain, time passes then a letter that your claim is denied. Seems rediculous. Better to know you don't have warranty than wast your money only to be frustrated. I'm ready to give up on android and an unreliable beta company. but add me to the list of sabotaged 6p lovers. Kelly Kay Mine shuts down at 25% without fail. Robert Hynes I still have the shutdown issue....anywhere from 60 to 20%. Unlikely I will get a pixel or other Google device unless there is a fix. Maybe we just need a more high profile device like a Samsung in order to get noticed. ←  Older Comments  → Follow Android Police 1.49M 470k 144k 116k Latest Deals 2 The new Humble Mobile Bundle has nine great platformers, including Never Alone: Ki Edition, for $5 2017/05/22 3:23pm PDTMay 22, 2017 9 [Deal Alert] Anker PowerCore II 3x USB 6A 20000mAh dual input battery $34 after $10 off coupon code 2017/05/22 2:50pm PDTMay 22, 2017 1 [Deal Alert] Start off this week with 17 temporarily free and 15 on-sale apps, plus the first 0.10 App of the Week 2017/05/22 2:13pm PDTMay 22, 2017 28 [Deal Alert] Samsung now offering a Galaxy S8 BOGO deal on T-Mobile better than T-Mobile's own deal 2017/05/22 1:38pm PDTMay 22, 2017 14 [Deal Alert] 2-pack Samsung fast wireless chargers $55 at Woot ($45+ off) 2017/05/21 10:52am PDTMay 21, 2017 Latest Poll Do you use a screen protector on your phone?

SMS support for Hangouts officially ends today, excluding Google Voice and Project Fi subscribers Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/22 2:29pm PDTMay 22, 2017 64 Plus 1 on G+ 177 Share on Facebook 77 Share on Twitter Total Shares318 Applications Google News Videos Today is the day that Hangouts finally loses SMS support. We were warned by Google about it months ago when Hangouts started showing a warning that it would no longer support the feature. But, as of today, it's finally set to happen. For anyone that isn't on Project Fi or Google Voice — both of which will continue to support SMS in Hangouts — this is the end of an era. Many people, myself included, made the final push into Hangouts over other services when SMS support was added. The integrated conversations made it much easier to keep short communications together in one place. So far there's no word on if SMS support will be coming to Allo. Now that Hangouts support for SMS is finally over, we aren't really left with a clear migration method. Anyone that might have made use of it will have to either deal with using two separate apps again or move over to a new service. If you are looking for recommendations, Google's stock Android Messages isn't so bad. But, if you've been enjoying having SMS and chats merged, that isn't really a solution. Allo is always an option. But, that's the same issue from the other side, you'd still need to find a way to send SMS messages. There's always Facebook Messenger or Signal, which both provide a combined SMS and chat solution. Each has its disadvantages, though.  The latter doesn't have quite the same feature set that Hangouts did, and the former is a Facebook product. Either way, it's closing time. You might have just enough left to send one last SMS before the lights are shut off. If you still plan on using Hangouts for chats going forward, make sure you've updated to the latest version of over at Google Play or APKMirror. Download QR-Code Hangouts Developer: Google Inc.

Now I like Hangouts just as they EOL it! TechGuy22 LOL 4Ui812 Google hangouts ... The only place where people never hanged out . cadtek91 *hung Ryne Hager Dunno, don't remember seeing anyone get hanged either. Even if we all got left out to dr-WHY GOOGLE, WHY?! JVF When referring to people it is always "Hanged", sounds funny but that's just how it is. It's a past participle. Ryne Hager Yup, I know. That was the joke. 4Ui812 I understand what you're saying and I debated the proper way to put it..... I have to stand by hanged. instinct I am like 6 different active group chats in Hangouts. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Google doesn't care about you. humulos A truer statement has never been said Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2c9aad5a41d09ce24c4c4e04e7b3a28a2004487ff015df2fc519b5c2a9556024.gif Adrien Aubel Google's messaging strategy is now: - Android Messages for carriers & OEMs - meaning strictly SMS/RCS - Allo for their new consumer messaging service, and the focus of their upcoming work - Hangouts for business/enterprise Nothing personal :) humulos How innocent we once were, at the time when we witnessed Talk, Voice, SMS and G+ Messages become a single product, fulfilling all our dreams. Undone in naught but a few years, with this final limb being ripped from the body. But I guess I'm on Project Fi, so I'm good for now. My parents weren't happy about this news, since our family communicates primarily on large Hangouts threads. mxwp but if they are using actual Hangouts IM threads and not SMS they can still use Hangouts Adrien Aubel IMHO those big plans haven't been followed by strict coding/design rules, and Hangouts became progressively a technical mess, then a true nightmare for anybody to work on, with the UI becoming slower with each version, fortunately partly compensated by faster phones. To be fair, SMS/MMS can be very complicated to deal with, and Android development was much harder and potentially messy when Babel has been developed, the technologies available nowadays would have helped a lot. So down the road it would have been neither productive or future-proof to keep iterating all efforts inside Hangouts, at least without a total recode from the ground up. Right now I wonder if they will indeed clean the code up to remove all carrier SMS/MMS, and eventually speed up the app and make it smaller, or just roughly disable it. t_newt If Hangouts became a technical mess, the solution isn't to drop Hangouts, it's to fix Hangouts. They could have made it a framework for their products that any of their messengers could be installed into. Instead they are trying to make it an enterprise Slack competitor. What company is going to trust their company to Google's leftovers? "SMS/MMS can be very complicated to deal with". Apparently this is true at Google. Duder12 They aren't getting the left overs. They are getting two brand new products. Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat. My name is…. Nobody ever used Hangouts for SMS outside America. Actually, nobidy uses SMS no more. There DOES exist a world outside America, you know, and its much bigger!! sproc Haha, you wish. Everyone I know is stuck on sms. They try whatsapp and stuff then abandon it. Adrien Aubel Especially iOS users, who already have a great "Messages" app that outsmarts SMS when possible. For them it doesn't make too much sense to download another messaging app every now and then. Rodrigo Gomes da Silva So.. where are you from? Jay No you wish, but you must be in the states. No one i know uses SMS anymore. It's an archaic dead service, only used for bank transaction notifications and amazon deliveries. Everyone else is either on whatsapp (yes 220 million of us in this country and growing at 4 million a month) or (wechat which is like what 85-90 percent of China) No one cares for SMS. TheDrunkenClam What an unnecessarily smug and nagging comment. Winston Well it's true, even if it's smug. Outside the US, SMS is pretty much dead as we've all moved towards WhatsApp, as carriers still don't give unlimited texts by default. I think it's time to start asking another company for SMS integration. Christopher Gannon That would work if so many people in the US weren't using iMessage, where the only way a non-apple user can chat is via SMS. Then apple makes it very difficult NOT to use it, so good luck convincing your friends to give up siri, etc. I'd also like a solution, like hangouts or iMessage, where messages aren't restricted to a phone, and I can seamlessly use both on my laptop, tablet or phone. Ryan Yes, but we still have all of the money. Magister Good for them. I live in us and everyone uses sms, so that's what I use. What everyone else uses is moot. Michael Sørensen Nonsense. I'm not in the US (Europe) and the VAST majority in my country still use SMS. Jason Hirsch I was very annoyed at having to add Hangouts as my SMS client. I couldn't keep separate separate anymore. Now in combination with Fi, GV, 2 phones and obi it's a nightmare. On this overseas trip i couldn't force Fi to dial via WiFi. So i had to go back and install Hangouts dialer. If they (Google) have a master plan there's no rhyme or reason to it. atc-tech Google Voice users should still be able to use it too, I think? I don't know. I switched the the updated GV app when it came out around the same time the hangouts DEintegration was announced, so I'm not sure, but I think Voice users still can... Aaron Berlin Who knows what the plan is long-term for GVoice in Hangouts, but the actual GVoice app is actually good now. No equivalent to the chrome extension/desktop app, though. Ryne Hager You are right, Google Voice users can also continue to receive SMS messages in the app, I'll make that more clear. atc-tech Cool. I wasn't sure GV still could, but I thought I remembered hearing that we could. I gave up already though and use the prettier new GV app... Wish they would add back more features though. Ryne Hager The new app is so pretty. I do wish my GV voicemails would show up in my call logs again, though. mxwp i exclusively use my GVoice number for calls and texts and use it on Hangouts. the update GVoice app has an annoying bug in that it tries to connect every account on your phone instead of just your main one. i have submitted it as a bug but have not heard anything back Tom Harman So when does Allo officially get SMS support, lol. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Same time it gets tablet support: Never. rndusrnm479461 Am I the only one who doesn't understand what's so good about SMS integration in either Allo or Hangouts? Is it really hard for you people to use 2 apps? Jesus christ. Google's "Android Messages" is lightweight anyway, why is it such a problem to use it? It shouldn't even eat much RAM. Kyle Gospodnetich Yes, yes you are. Please never work for Google, or really any company that has a hand in communications. My name is…. No, he is not Kyle Gospodnetich Congrats, now there's two of you idiots. iluvthesoftsoft One do-it-all app > two apps Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi, https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi, we're trying to fix texting on Android and provide transparent switch between SMS&IM (devices handshake when you get into chats so that we determine whether you or the recipient has poor reception and should prefer SMS for example). MJ Two apps? One app for SMS and than Facebook, WhatsApp, Allo/Hangouts, and whatever to cover all my contacts. SMS is the only thing I can message 100% of my contacts with. Adrien Aubel Google's messaging strategy is now: - Android Messages for carriers & OEMs - meaning strictly SMS/RCS - Allo for their new consumer messaging service, and the focus of their upcoming work - Hangouts for business/enterprise They can't risk to upset carrier and OEMs by implementing non-carrier features in Android Messages / the default SMS app they provide. Or at least it's a risk they're not ready to take at that time. Btw I wouldn't say "Android Messages" is that lightweight btw, notably on modern devices it could be so much smoother :( sam1331 I don't get it either. When Android Messages came out I switched my SMS over to it. I quickly realized I was using it almost exclusively for 2 factor verification codes. But really, the notifications all go to the same place, I already have to decide whether to use Hangouts or Facebook Messenger when talking to basically anyone anyway. I also think people should push a little harder to move conversations over from SMS to something else, I've never found that to be very difficult. mxwp SMS is convenient because you know it will work with any American with a cell phone... including "dumb" flip phones. And it actually is really difficult to get people to switch to another service. Apple users just use imessage to send their SMS to me. And then I send them my glorious green bubbles and those ishills can suck it. YaKillaCJ Sms integration is important because it is supported by 100% of telecommunications service providers and integrated on all devices that can make a phone call and has a screen. You can even sms a home phone without a screen depending on carrier/service provider. Thus it messaging that works with 100% of your contacts. Having multiple Apps spread across 100s of contacts is plain annoying. So if any App wants to be taken serious, it needs to be serious and have sms. What's App already fills the void for bypassing sms across the globe. rndusrnm479461 This answer makes the most sense. Thanks. Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi! play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi We're still new and young but we're very serious about our ambitions and not settling when we know it could/should be better. To fix texting on Android, we provide transparent switch between SMS&IM (devices handshake when you get into chats so that we determine whether you or the recipient has poor reception and should prefer SMS for example). Very handy in some countries/areas/events. And lets you reach *anybody* (that has a phone number). My name is…. Nobody uses SMS no more, and if i wanna send a text message to the last of the Mohicans, i will use my SMS app. I dont want no stupid integration and no stupid 'SMS fallback' that will make things worse. Chatting is not texting. YaKillaCJ There are only 2 widely used methods of messaging across mobile devices. Sms and What's App. Sms is supported on EVERY device from 2 way pagers and flip phones to house phones and smartphones. Any device that has a phone number supports sms. The majority of people doesn't care about added features like stickers and gif. We just care that all I need is the person phone number and from there I can call or text them. That's it. Bottom line is that it has to be a standard adopted by carriers on a worldwide scale. Hence what's app reason for such large scale use is it uses existing phone numbers for login, existing phone book for contact list, free, minimum data usage and encrypted. Even that is still not even used by a third of the devices that use sms. Ryuuie Last I checked, WhatsApp charged $1 or someshit. erptastic It has not done that officially for years. And even before that, they always just extended my account. disqus_Xz3y8OiO3O It's free mxwp in the larger scheme of things, I agree with you that it is not a big deal. still, having one app do both was convenient. the other complaint is Android fanboys being envious of iMessage, which Hangouts could have become. exadeci The main reason that people use Imessage is that you get rich messaging capabilities out of the box if the person you are talking to has an Iphone everything is abstracted, you add someone's number and you start chatting right aways no need to exchange accounts id's or find which app you both use. And if the other doesn't have an Iphone you can still message them or if you killed your data plan it sends an sms. But Google doesn't add sms support because they are pushing for RCS which is a GOOD thing: Standalone Messaging 1-to-1 Chat Group Chat File Transfer Content Sharing Social Presence Information IP Voice call Best Effort Video call Geolocation Exchange Audio Messaging Network based blacklist Capability Exchange based on Presence or SIP OPTIONS All this WITHOUT using any data, data needs an link to be established this doesn't. Chris Hannan It's not hard for most of us to use it. The problem is the people we contact don't want to use separate apps. Everyone with iPhones uses iMessage because it just works by default. But barely anybody I know uses Hangouts and nobody I know uses Allo. If it was all built into one app that shipped with Android phones, more people would use it. Troy Leonard and I removed Hangouts as of today I will no longer consider using any google messaging service ever again Sruly J Isn't Gmail a form of messaging? (Or do you not use Gmail?) Troy Leonard Not for long I'm transitioning over to outlook.com. And upgrading my phone to an iPhone. I'm sick of slow to no updates on my phone,and done with Google ruining everything I ever liked about their apps and Android. naysayer Good riddance. Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi), a new app that we're making that brings a lot of the goodies iMessage brings to iOS users, with big long-term ambitions, and still trying to preserve a consistent and sleek UI. Hopefully that will make you stick to Android and you'll make your iPhone friends jealous in a few months/years ;) Zsolt V Why bother evangilizing? He already decided Outlook on an iPhone is better than Gmail, so let him enjoy it. Troy Leonard Your link is broken Adrien Aubel Fixed thanks! Disqus didn't like the closing ')' at the end of the link. XgudwilX eww outloook😲 Total Insecurity Saying "upgrading my phone to an iPhone" is the same as converting from atheism to any religion. Just a downgrade. bekifft It's true, and their failings and obvious ulterior motives in messaging have, for the first time in a decade, made me consider moving my email back to a private service over which I have control. Roy Thank you and have a nice flight. -Matoro Zeliph- Just want to make sure I'm not missing anything. So Google Voice SMS will no longer work too? Corbin Davenport That will still work as well. Ryne Hager Google voice will still work, just like Fi. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ It's primarily that regular SMS will no longer function in the app. A while back they killed of threading of SMS/MMS and Hangout messages, and now they are killing SMS/MMS entirely out of the app and suggestin people to switch to Android Messages. Bill Blandford Hangouts SMS looks like it still works for Google Voice SMS too. Essentially, this is like Fi, which is a Google Voice number at heart. My wifi-only-device kids use Hangouts to call and text with a Google Voice #. Timmy Turner Yeah GV will continue to work through Hangouts since the number you use via Project-Fi is a GV given number. Adrien Aubel For people that were still using Hangouts and want to try a new app that also does SMS & IM, that tries to provide a fast & polished experience to fix texting on Android, I'd love some honest feedback! https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi We're trying hard to "make it right" and have so much planned on the roadmap, so any feedback is great to have to tweak things up. Let us know what you think! exadeci While the initiative is nice, why would we use your messaging app? If I want an instant message app that does sms and that no one else uses I already got Signal and at least Signal is proven to be secure. What makes Messenger (Facebook), WhatsApp and Imessage good? Their userbase. Ask anyone for a way to communicate and they will use one of those apps, no need for fallback sms when everyone has an account. Adrien Aubel Thanks for your feedback @exadeci:disqus! Great questions :) And Signal is nice as well! It's not for everybody but if you're happy with it keep using it but make sure to check us out in a few months to check that you haven't been missing out, we're going fast! I think there's much more to iMessage that makes it good than their userbase. It is a polished app that just works, and lets you reach anybody, therefore becoming your trusted "go to" texting app. We expect Google to release this summer new capabilities that will let you use IM in more scenarios. Very interesting stuff that we can't wait to let our users benefit from. But our initial target is actually SMS users, people that unlike you and I don't really care about the details, they just want a reliable app that sends and receive their messages. And they're actually quite happy with SMS/MMS in that regard, it just works (when you don't fight with APNs, something we try to prevent as well). We want to transparently "upgrade" those users that may be using Android Messages or a 3rd party app custom-made for the carrier or OEM, not necessarily developed with great care and polishment, and sometimes truly terrible (really, you wouldn't believe what's on some popular carriers, that most users end up using 10 times a day for years). Right now invi is mostly upgrading the transport of your messages and general experience as we develop another big focus of ours: bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages exchanged being plain text. Texting can be the most impersonal way of communication and this flattens relationships. A bar suggests as you type relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps you transmit how you truly felt when writing this message, it doesn't flatten as much your emotions (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). It always send instantly over IM as well (no upload or anything like that, optimized WebP images for super-fast download). Open your top 3 chats on Signal, chats that you have with people you care the most about, look at all this flat plain texting, and try to visualize the gap compared to what it could be, how it could have been more personal and transmitting more of your feelings or emotions. We're targeting this gap, and again, we're just getting started but have serious ambitions and motivation. If you use Snapchat, look at all that rich media that gets thrown to your eyes or that you throw to people, that doesn't always make sense and is often disconnected from conversations, sometimes losing its value and feeling like you just threw a bottle in the ocean, just leaving you with a list of who saw it. We're looking at that gap as well, as invi becomes more and more rich in terms of content creation. After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. We are in talks with some OEMs and resellers to make invi default which would help grow invi's user base and help us improve our product with more diverse usage, while some upcoming features of invi should ultimately help us get a lot more users naturally. exadeci Signal has actually Gifs from Giphy, stickers and the possibility to send a location but I don't use this kind of feature even on Messenger it's quite rare that I send a sticker. Google is strongly pushing for RCS adoption which would add all these emotions sharing: https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Rogers_Google_RCS.gif https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Telenor_6P_GIF_0UHHQdI.gif https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/RCS_Android_Update.width-600.png Adrien Aubel Exactly, but how relevant is Giphy? Again don't compare with things you've seen so far but with what it could potentially be if it truly understood your relationships and intentions, if it combined that with your taste and the way you usually communicate with this specific person. And what if your friends or other people were able to add their own media and stickers through channels and then be discovered, liked and followed, with deep intelligence powering it all and bringing the right content to the right user? We built invi to support all this, we don't just use a Giphy API, we used the most advanced and lightweight technologies to communicate in realtime with our backend, even on pretty bad 3G, from where we curate the media that eventually gets recommended to you. The screenshots you attached look great as well, but see Android Messages is a good example there's only 5 packs of stickers that won't get more relevant or smarter no matter how many stickers you use or how many times you use Android Messages. Idk who would use a given sticker hundreds of times, but anyway I'm not sure those were really representative of how Android Messages is most commonly used. The features are technically there, as often, but they're very limited in their potential as of now. The Awesome Bar isn't for everyone but can eventually help people like you, as images just get displayed while you're typing, no action required, and if you see one that you like you can just tap it to see how it looks and enrich your message, send and you're done. Google is pushing RCS, very true! And we're excited about the great work the Jibe team did in the past couple years. They're a bit shy to share their RCS client implementation at the moment, it may be unstable or not well documented at the moment, but we're meeting regularly with Google and hope to add RCS to our transparent switch as soon as possible, even though the user base is a bit limited at the moment it has the potential to grow fast and solve many issues. If they're reluctant for too long we may use other hubs that would communicate seamlessly through Unified Profile. But for now, we're watching the number of users actually benefiting from RCS grow while we focus on other areas of improvements. sam1331 I am actually kind of optimistic about all this, more so than I was maybe a year ago. They've been putting out a steady stream or improvements to Allo, and when I've experimented with it with a friend it actually is an enjoyable experience. Releasing it without a web app is just shocking, but if that's added and it works well, I could totally see moving over to it from Hangouts, where I do the vast majority of my communicating. The other piece of the puzzle is Duo. If they can integrate a Duo button in Allo conversations (like it seems they will), and they eventually add group calling, which can't be that far off, then I think it will be a nice solution for myself and my family. And I've got quite a few friends that are all about Android instead of iOS, so I can see them switching to Allo from Hangouts. But not until there is a web app, because they aren't stupid. Chad Knasinski I would use Allo if they added SMS support and a desktop version like Hangouts had. Nick.Trite Same here. I have Fi so I'll continue to use Hangouts for SMS. I really love the fact that I can switch seamlessly from desktop to mobile and still be sending SMS. Until Allo does that, I won't consider moving. Chad Knasinski Ditto Sir_Brizz And multi-device support. Can't even use it or sync it on my LTE Tablet... Carson Saldanha So, basically Hangouts but revamped? We've come in full-circle. Sir_Brizz Sure. The problem is that every other chat platform has these features in 2016. Including Hangouts. Roy Me to, love it. mxwp unless they remove hangouts from gmail, people will still secretly be using "hangouts" all the time. in fact, the only way Allo will ever take off without SMS is if it replaces Hangouts (gtalk) on gmail and inbox. Chad Knasinski So correct me if I am wrong here but Google wants us to do this with our messages: SMS - Google Messenger Business SMS - Hangouts Messages - Allo Facebook - Messenger Video Chat - Duo Business Video Chat - Hangouts Video Really? Are you kidding me here? Timmy Turner You've got it right and if there's a joke, you'll being waiting a while for the punchline. disqus_em5YfkbWdk What Business SMS and how is 8t different from other SMS? Zsolt V What does Facebook have to do with anything you wrote? So you are corrected. SpadeX Are you new to tech world? Timmy Turner I recommend Textra to anyone looking for a new SMS app. Sleek, customizable and continually updated/supported. Adrien Aubel Textra is very nice, notably customization-wise as you said, you can go deep and fine-tune basically any UX element. And it's super fast and lightweight as well. I am working as well on a new SMS app that also provides IM similarly to iMessage on iPhone, and many other features, most of them upcoming though. Would you mind giving me a honest feedback when you have the time? It's called invi on the Play Store https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi Timmy Turner Sure thing. freshprince_87 That invi SMS app is an awesome app. Near flawless app. but I stop using it because I kept having problems with MMS messages and also it just like Allo in the sense where if you uninstall the app and reinstall it on the same phone all your instant messages are all gone including some of the regular SMS /MMS messages. You need to make the app save all your messages on to an account like a Google account in the cloud. So that no matter what device you use the instant messages will still be there. Adrien Aubel @freshprince_87:disqus Thank you for your feedback! MMS can be very tricky and every carrier has its own set of specificities, I'm sorry about that, it shows we're still young but obviously like you said, such a core functionality bug makes our whole effort worthless for you here. Do you mind sharing your carrier, device model, and Android version? Did you try using "Legacy MMS" in the app settings? About the IM sync, that's an issue we're definitely looking into, considering all potential security and privacy issues, notably as some countries like USA recycle pretty aggressively your phone numbers, and with the desire to bring a Web client in mind. Google should announce this summer APIs that will eventually help us regarding security, so stay tuned :) freshprince_87 Thanks. I didn't use the legacy MMS. I hope that you add the IM sync soon. I'm on a T-Mobile service using the Moto Z Play on Android Nougat 7.0 Adrien Aubel Ok thank you, if you don't mind I have other questions to dive into your problem :) What specifically was failing? MMS sending, receiving, or both? Did it show an error? Is it only on group MMS or all MMS? Whatever information you may have will be helpful. Our next release should bring MMS reliability improvements and notably Wifi texting when supported by the carrier (first MMS may send up to 60s to send as we're trying out routes but then all other Wifi MMS should send very fast). Tom Westrick https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5ecvBaqHBk MJ Thank God I use Project Fi otherwise this would suck big time for me. TJ Mills Thank God I have Google voice.... Dracono Love hangouts never used SMS. It also seems most negative reviews about it being slow was always tired to the SMS feature. I'm now curious with the removal of they'll us the opportunity to evolve or let it idle. mxwp it will evolve into a business app... but hopefully still available for consumers VAVAMk_2 Just give us SMS support in Allo for Christ's sake! Adrien Aubel SMS/MMS can be quite hard to deal with technically and Google didn't choose to go that way. It is possibly also due to the push they did to replace the default SMS app on many OEMs and carriers, strategically it's hard for them to push much of Google's agenda through the SMS app they give carriers, and they're mostly limited to SMS/RCS. Roy Christ will not give you SMS, bat Star of David could promise you RCS in Allo. mxwp Big G repeatedly stated it would never happen tim242 Liar. Adrien Aubel https://twitter.com/amitfulay/status/840236304130428928 Roy Great. It's was the plan all along. Now Allow will get RCS and web browser everything gonna integrate with Duo. I'm all the way in. I never like Hangout. I love Allo. #stop stop babies don't you cry. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I don't think that's possible. RCS is still mainly just an extension of SMS. If it doesn't support SMS, I don't see it handling RCS. Roy When RCS will come it will be with SMS already. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Based on what? Besnik Rrustemi No problem guys,we have like 69 other Messaging Apps by Google to choose from and maybe 2 new others coming soon. Roy Haha it's so old. Can someone can come with new jokes here? Besnik Rrustemi Well sorry Old Man then, never knew your age before. * Respect for Old People * Sir_Brizz Let the confusion officially begin! Indianajonze google can go fk themselves Robert Gerhart Why isn't anybody asking the bigger question: why the hell does anyone use outdated SMS in the first place? It's like complaining that Hangouts doesn't integrate butter churns and wagon wheels either. There is nothing more annoying than a text message. Adrien Aubel SMS is always nice to have in some situations, that happen more or less depending on where you live. Uncovered areas, concerts or big games, people having no LTE-enabled plans, or simply on some roads and highways. In USA for example all those scenarios happen a lot, notably in some states. And eventually, in most countries you still use SMS for 3rd party services, banks, transportation, or even government-related messages. Most importantly, in countries that still use SMS you can reach *anybody you know* from one app. And that's really a great thing to have. Now you're right, IM is so much more pleasant. Instant delivery, read status, last active time, way faster image format and transport. At invi ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi ) we try to take advantage of this and combine both the way it should be. When you open a chat with somebody, we trigger a handshake to check that both you and the recipient are well connected. If one of both doesn't answer on time, it simply switches to SMS/MMS, it's automatic and out of your way. Otherwise you take advantage of state-of-the-art transport with some unique optimizations. Try to send a GIF over IM and see how fast it goes, compared to MMS or even Whatsapp. Let me know what you think! Aaron Simple; SMS is ubiquitous. Every cellular device in operation can send and receive SMS, from the most current and expensive flagships like the iPhone and Galaxy, to the cheapest budget devices, all the way down to the oldest flip phones. I can text my dad on his flip, my wife on her Nexus or my Capt on his iPhone and each one will receive that message and reply. Show me an IM that can do all of that (that isn't on the iPhone). I guess that invi app that guy's been pedaling might, but I'm waiting for it to gain some traction before trying to convince anybody to switch to yet another IM. Rod The rest of the world uses Whatsapp, everyone has it installed. JG Even people with generic flip phones? Rod Nope, but I don't remember the last time I saw someone with a flip phone. The poor now bear Galaxy Win/Pocket/etc JG My aunt still has one. She recently attempted to upgrade to a smartphone but that seems to have failed big time... Apparently my telling her to tap the icon that's labeled "EMAIL" to get her email is too complicated... That and the free phone she got is a PoS... 512MB of RAM and only 4GB of storage - with the OS consuming all but like 100MB there of. So it didn't perform quite so hot. She seemed a bit surprised her free phone didn't perform as well as my Pixel XL does... TJ Mills Everyone in China uses Wi chat. Rod USA is a world apart. lomsha Believe it or not, even 2g is still a luxury in some countries, which makes​ instant messaging iffy. In those cases sms is a great alternative. Not everyone is in the 1st world with a sweet smartphone and reliable data access. TJ Mills Standard is better than better. When someone comes up with a universal replacement that works on all classes of phones, then the world can switch. Until then it's a mishmash of services and applications​to communicate. Why does everyone still use email? Because of the standards. Michael Sørensen Convince me why I shouldn't... Currently I can write to anyone for free without first asking them what their preferred platform is. And they can reply for free regardless of said preferred platform. Again, convince me why that's not good enough? And don't say "stickers". Just don't. Security? Bah, no sensitive information sent. Midnitte At this point, I'm held hostage stuck using Hangouts since it's the only thing that natively supports desktop messaging. Sigh. Lord Argyris "Each has its disadvantages, though. The latter doesn't have quite the same feature set that Hangouts did, and the former is a Facebook product." It's lines like these that keep.me coming back to AP. JD My support for Google and their messaging platforms ended the beginning of May. Kelly Clubb Well this sucks for any user that enjoyed an easy to use sms app. I use Hangouts and thankfully for project fi will continue it's support BossMa1n3 Eh..doesn't effect me stop using hangout for sms awhile ago..more interested in a flat screen phone with side bezels as thin as the one in the pic.. Grey PLEASE Bring Hangouts Chat and Hangouts Meet to all users. That has so many new and awesome features. It's like everything Allo isn't. DragoCubed The comment section is rough b_boogey_xl Bye Hangouts! hp-fourtwenty oh ffs...voice is still supported??? hell yeah!! nxtiak I'm waiting for the day G+ contacts disappear from Hangouts. I hate how on PC when I type a name to start a conversation it lists random people on G+. SHOW ME THE NAMES FROM MY DAMN CONTACTS GOOGLE!!!!!!!!! Maave RIP Hangouts. I had group chats, Google Voice, and SMS all in one. Now my group chats have moved to Telegram but I'm still stuck with nerfed Hangouts for GV.

How Google plans to tackle power consumption even more aggressively in Android Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 5:29pm PDTMay 18, 2017 15 Plus 1 on G+ 99 Share on Facebook 58 Share on Twitter Total Shares172 Android OS Development Google News Videos Yesterday at I/O Google had an interesting talk called Background Check and Other Insights into the Android Operating System Framework. It's a long name, but really it's about improving battery life in Android. It went on at great length as to how, exactly, they plan on doing that, and it's quite worth a watch. We have the video here, but if you don't have the half-hour to check it out, then you are welcome to read below. The central methodology Google is using to try to improve things is the idea of visibility. When something is running in the background and doing a ton of stuff like calling your location at quick intervals, it results in battery drain. So now Google wants to change how things happen in the background, by ensuring that free-running background services aren't sucking your battery dry. Background apps will be pushed out of memory when they leave the foreground, and requests for things like location or WiFi happening in the background will only occasionally see new information from Android. Applications that would otherwise receive broadcasts also might not wake up unless they are given an explicit call to do so in the broadcast, although there are some exceptions. Apps can still get around this by being foregrounded in some way, but now that will be something visible that the user is aware of. This focus on visibility for apps will also mean developers will have to make decisions about what is really better to the user. If doing an ongoing notification as a means of bypassing the stuff above would confuse a user, is that really the right thing for them to do in that case? Other tools can be used to schedule your tasks ahead of time or to wait for events like the job intent service that developers can use in both pre and post-O environments. Jobs and alarms also allow the OS to defer. So, if something happens that would trigger a bunch of other apps to wake up, like a new picture being taken, that can be passed to those apps one at a time after a delay. That way the user doesn't suddenly have a ton of performance issues and drain out of nowhere. Basically, Google wants to solve some of the problems with battery life by defining bad behaviors for developers, like persistent background services or accidental leaks to the background of typically foregrounded activities, and make it clear that things have to be done the right way going forward or their stuff won't work. But it's also giving them new tools and choices for how to best accomplish the things they need to do. The new features in the Play Console and in Android Studio should also help developers be aware of when they are making these mistakes so that they can be fixed. It's a matter of visibility for the developers as well as visibility for the users. To paraphrase Steve Balmer: Visibility, visibility, visibility. A significant user-facing change of this visibility mindset is a new battery menu in O, with a focus on actionable interaction. Instead of just seeing stuff like Screen and Google Play Services next to a number that they won't understand, now users will be given ways of interacting with that data if they don't like it, and can better see how they are using applications without needing to do a bunch of mental calculations. So, when a user has a problem with their expectations of battery performance and goes looking to see what might be causing it, they are more likely to find what caused it, understand what it means, and take action about it. All of these changes are is in pursuit of Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life. Right now the tools in software aren't all there, but these are steps that can take us in that direction.

Good feature to take from iOS Knowledgeborn Allah This does seem similar to what Apple implemented in iOS, but I'm curious about how this will impact RAM management. If it reduces the cache file too much, it'll just close the application completely, and you'll have to start over every time you want to use the app again. Apple somehow found a way around this problem, even in devices with less RAM, but I'm not too sure how Google will accomplish this. Even "doze" on my Pixel XL kills apps in the background all the time. This new thing sounds it could potentially make the problem worse. Justin Osborne Well I sure can tell a difference since upgrading, that's for sure. The new battery section makes me feel a lot better about how the battery is looking. But that's where it ends. Today, I got a full hour less out of my battery than normal. 2 hours vs 3-3.5 on the Pixel. That said, it's a beta, so I'm not complaining. It's definitely not the direction I want to go tho (nor are these new emoticons, sigh). marcusmarcus2 "Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life." I'm glad, but can we get a two pronged attack to address this. Yes, Google needs to keep improving the software side, but OEMs need to help out and quit making thinner phones. They are thin enough, give us more battery capacity. AbdulB1 actually they save quite a lot by putting small batteries in the phones instead of big ones. Krzysztof Jozwik I'm not sure you read OP's comment. Nothing was said about saving... AbdulB1 smaller capacity battery is much cheaper marcusmarcus2 My original comment was not about savings, cheapness, cost, etc. Jack Jennings You've said the same thing twice for no reason. Krzysztof Jozwik I wouldn't say "much" I'm no expert on the matter, but last I checked replacement batteries aren't that expensive, and I don't have the buying power of an oem AbdulB1 Most phones today dont have replacement batteries, they have unremovable ones. OEM or no OEM a 3000mAh battery will always be cheaper than 4000mAh one. marcusmarcus2 I can find batteries for my different Moto G phones that have "Non-User replaceable batteries" for nearly the same price as my LG phones that have user replaceable batteries online. Most likely the OEMs can get them for about the same as well so replaceable or not really does not matter. Either way, yes a 3000mAh battery will be cheaper than a 4000mAh one for OEMs, but probably not much at all, especially at the volume they would by at. I'm guessing they are choosing smaller batteries to make their phones thinner and not because it is slightly cheaper for them. Thinness is better to advertise to most consumers as most consumers are drawn to looks over functionality now a days. I still prefer function over looks for my devices. Krzysztof Jozwik And non replaceable will always be cheaper than replaceable. The point is, the batteries aren't the bulk of the cost. Geoff Johnson What the hell is your point? He never said anything about cost, he was just talking about stop making phones thinner for design and aesthetic reasons. james fuston The idea that smaller and thinner phones result in less battery life is a bit of a misnomer. For an example, I'd refer you to the iPhone SE. marcusmarcus2 I never said smaller and thinner. I just said thinner. They could make some of the phones the same height and width as the current one but make it a little thicker to give a thicker battery, and that would help with the battery life. james fuston Okay, but your general sentiment is still that battery life is tied directly to physical size which, again stating my example of the iPhone SE, isn't the case. The power draw of the components is far more important than the physical size of the phone. marcusmarcus2 My general sentiment is ONLY in regards to thickness of the phone. My sentiment is not to width or height, which also make up the size of the phone. The width and height is usually determined more by the screen where thickness is more often do to battery. A larger screen (component) will draw more power than a smaller screen, I agree with you there. But you seem to think the size of the battery does not make a difference, please correct me if I am wrong. Using your example of iPhone SE, if they would have made that a little thicker than it is now by making the battery larger, that would have made the battery life even longer than it already is. That is my point. james fuston > A larger screen (component) will draw more power than a smaller screen, I agree with you there. Let me give this one more shot. "your general sentiment is still that battery life is tied directly to physical size which, again stating my example of the iPhone SE, isn't the case" To break out the pieces, battery life is tied...to physical size...which, again...isn't the case. In other words, we do not agree. The iPhone SE is the exact same size as the iPhone 5S and it gets 30%+ better battery life purely through efficiency in components. To say high mAh results in long battery life is a misnomer that the G6 or V20 should be a clear reminder of. You also cannot equate physical size to battery capacity as energy density is not a universal measurement. marcusmarcus2 You are comparing different phones with different components. I agree with you that component efficiency has an effect on battery life. But... Let me give you one more shot. We will use your iPhone SE for this. If there were 2 versions of the SE. Both have the exact same components except one has a battery that is 1000 mAh larger than the other (thus making it slightly thicker), than the one with the larger battery would have more battery life, Thus the thicker one would have better battery life. That is what I am saying. I'm not comparing large phones to small phones. I'm saying if they had a larger battery in a phone with the exact same specs/components then the battery life would be better. That is all my point was. Do you not agree with that? EDIT: Yes, size of the battery may not increase with capacity due to density, but it usually will increase in size as it does increase in capacity, especially if it increases a lot. Geoff Johnson Again, you're talking about it being smaller. The iPhone SE gets good battery life because it has a 4" screen. The complaint is that phones are getting THINNER. Meaning that they still have 5.5-6" displays, but are thinner and translate to smaller batteries. james fuston Nope, not at all. The cell in the SE is about 50mAh bigger than the 5S (which is the exact same size). The 30%+ battery life improvement comes from more efficient components, not just their size. marcusmarcus2 Technically it is 2 dimensional train of thought. Also, if they increased it horizontally or vertically, then they would most likely have to increase the dimensions of the phone horizontally or vertically, thus changing the size of the screen or bezel. Increasing it thickness wise means they would not have to change the look of the of the front of the phone. Anywho, I'm only talking about thickness, not height, width, different components, different phones, not small phones or big phones. I'm talking just battery capacity, if all other components remain the same. Thickening the battery would add battery capacity without changing the over all look much at all. It could be any phone of your choosing. If adding a thicker/higher capacity battery to whatever 1 phone you want, that phone would have a longer battery life. Do you not agree with that logic? james fuston Thickness is commonly referred to as "depth" otherwise known as the Z-axis. That's one dimension. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8cba520372d511803190227fe949a5d698a79509804cb6ec7f8f2afbe25323c3.gif marcusmarcus2 you are right, that is 1 dimensional thinking. I read it wrong. And you are right I miss the joke as I do not see what is funny. I'm glad you know that thickness is depth, but when referring to phones, depth is commonly referred to as thickness. Anyways, You are the one that is applying 3 dimensional thinking when my general sentiment was only referring to 1 dimension, thus you pretty much accused me of referring it to all dimensions, when I was not. Now you are complaining I'm only applying it to 1 dimension. Which is it? https://68.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmbq2nuTrp1qcr8tuo1_500.gif In all seriousness though. I AM only referring to 1 dimension, thickness or depth (whichever you want to go by). Then they can fit a thicker battery in to increase its capacity without having to get a higher cost denser battery and without changing the over all look of the phone. Compare that to getting a battery that is larger in height and/or width, that phone would need to be designed with either a larger bezel (which would most likely make the phone look bad) or use a larger screen (which would most likely be less power efficient which would negate some of the extra battery capacity). james fuston > you are right I miss the joke as I do not see what is funny. Missing the joke and not seeing the joke as funny are two different things, but the joke wasn't really meant for you either way. > I'm glad you know that thickness is depth, but when referring to phones, depth is commonly referred to as thickness Yes, this is referred to as a "synonym" in the English language. > You are the one that is applying 3 dimensional thinking when my general sentiment was only referring to 1 dimension, thus you pretty much accused me of referring it to all dimensions I'm not sure you understand how to use "thus." To recap; you said the way to make battery life longer was to make phones thicker. I said you shouldn't conflate (that means mistakenly associate) thickness with battery life, as the physical size of a battery can also be increased with an adjustment in width or height of a phone. Not sure how you got me "[accusing you] of referring it to all dimensions" out of that. I can tell now that your argument originates from the fact that you don't like bezels and aren't crazy about large screens, but also want longer battery life. The reality here is that the majority of people disagree with you and would care significantly if their next phone was substantially thicker than their current phone, largely due to the fact that increased thickness makes curved-edged or "bezel less" phones significantly harder to hold. marcusmarcus2 >Yes, this is referred to as a "synonym" in the English language. Yes, we both agree on the fact it means the same. I just wasn't sure why you pointed out it is the same as depth when that seems to have been obvious to both of us. Maybe I did not use 'thus' correctly, but I'm sure you know what I meant and just don't want to address it. >To recap; you said the way to make battery life longer was to make phones thicker. I said you shouldn't conflate (that means mistakenly associate) thickness with battery life, as the physical size of a battery can also be increased with an adjustment in width or height of a phone. Not sure how you got me "[accusing you] of referring it to all dimensions" out of that. How do you not get you, you just repeated it? I was only referring to 1 dimension and you are trying to apply more dimensions to, which would change the over all look of the phone which would make people that like that phone not want that phone any more, whatever the phone was to begin with. Also, your recap is incorrect. I just said phones should be thicker for better battery life, meaning the thickness should come because of a thicker battery. Your response was address "smaller AND thinner phones" meaning you were applying other dimensions to the thickness which would make it a different phone with most likely different parts. >I can tell now that your argument originates from the fact that you don't like bezels and aren't crazy about large screens Half right and half wrong. I don't like bezels. I do like large screens though. I'm not referring to big phones or small phones. I'm refering to and phone compared to itself but thicker. You are the one comparing different size (width and height) phones. My point is you don't have to change the look of whatever phone you like if you just increase the thickness, whether that phone is large or small. >The reality here is that the majority of people disagree with you You sure about that? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/013a3bd18bb4ffc1eba1ece1d07e1fe9b6aeb2639380ca6c9fe00b40e043e452.png When a company releases 2 choices of the same phone with only the thickness/battery being different (same screen size, storage, RAM, processor, etc.) then we can see if people really do feel about thickness over battery life) Sk0ly You can't compare between OSs. There is a reason Android uses more battery, it features true multitasking and doesn't drastically limit background processes like iOS. Looks like Google is going a bit to the Apple approach going forward as devs can't be counted on to write decent code. james fuston Seeing as we're talking about physical dimensions and hardware specifications and they're effect on power draw, you absolutely can compare between operating systems. Processors aren't suddenly able to use more power than they're designed to use just because you've installed a different operating system. Jason B "Processors aren't suddenly able to use more power than they're designed to use just because you've installed a different operating system." Just to jump in: sure, they won't use more than their design power, but they can be used very inefficiently depending on OS. All modern mobile SoCs have hardware clock and power gating, but if software isn't allowing the SoC to idle properly or needs to use more CPU/GPU cycles to complete tasks versus other OS, yes, you will use more power as the clocks+voltage jump around instead of going into SoC's proper sleep mode for former or will hold onto higher clocks longer for latter. Apple makes both its hardware and software, so if you think that has no net effect, well ... Sk0ly Except the OS's operate in a completely different manner. Androids advantage being background functionality and iOS advantage being battery life. marcusmarcus2 What's this "We" stuff? You are talking about physical dimensionS and hardware specificationS. I'm talking about A physical dimension and the only hardware specification I'm talking about is the capacity of the battery resulting from it being thicker. You don't like @Sk0ly:disqus comparing different OS's when OS's have nothing to do with the point you are making? That's funny because you are doing the same thing to me, comparing different size (height and width) phones with different specs when that has nothing to do with the point I am making. marcusmarcus2 To be fair, @j_fuze:disqus was not comparing between OSs. He was comparing between different iOS devices. Specifically iPhone SE and iPhone 5S. You have to read a few of his comments to see what he was comparing. Either way, he missed my point by comparing different phones with different specs. My point was if ALL things being the same between 2 phones, except one had a thicker/larger capacity battery, that would give that thicker phone more battery life. I'm not sure why James is so hell bent on comparing different size phones with different specs/components. james fuston > James is so hell bent on comparing different size phones with different specs/components. lol, because I'm not interested in comparing different colors of the same phone? I didn't realize we were comparing battery life of hypothetical devices. marcusmarcus2 Colors? What are talking about now? Seriously, focus. >I didn't realize we were comparing battery life of hypothetical devices. I'm glad you started to finally read then and figured it out. Unfortunately, they will stay hypothetical until companies come out with devices with bigger batteries. james fuston Yes, colors. What other difference could there possibly be if the dimensions and specs of the phone are the same? You're 0/3 on understanding a point presented by someone else now. marcusmarcus2 >You're 0/3 on understanding a point presented by someone else now. haha. Lets address this part first because it is too funny. Not only can you not focus, you are delusional. You are the one who cannot get a point and you try to say I don't get a point. You are hilarious. I'm the OP of this thread of comments, you replied to me initially and you failed to understand the point. You have since replied numerous other times and have failed again and again to understand the point, each time bringing up different aspects of a phone that had nothing to do with my initial point. I get your points, but they have nothing to do with what my point is initially. Just because you can't understand that does not mean I don't get your point. >Yes, colors. What other difference could there possibly be if the dimensions and specs of the phone are the same Hmm. This is a tough one. Maybe battery capacity and additional thickness dues to extra battery capacity, you know, like I have said since the bigining and in every other comment since then. No other dimension and spec other than those, like I said each time. Talk about not understanding a point, you are the king of missing the point. https://media.giphy.com/media/14r9VMLSuQUzQs/giphy.gif Lets try to make this easy for you. Try to answer the following. I'll give you a little help by giving you the answers seeing as you have trouble catching the point of this original comment thread. Would a larger capacity battery give a phone more battery life compared to a smaller capacity battery, considering that is the only difference? Yes. Would increasing the thickness of a battery give it more capacity, considering that is the only difference? Yes. Would a thicker battery result in a thicker phone, considering that is the only difference? Yes. Are there other ways of increasing battery life? (This was not part of my original point, but since you keep adding it then I'll address it) Of course, like more optimized software or more efficient parts. Would including a larger capacity battery along with optimizing the software and more efficient parts give more battery life than optimized software and more efficient parts alone? Of course they would. Do more efficient parts have anything to do with your point you are trying to make? No What about color? Again, nothing to do with my point. What about box the phone comes in? No, but I thought I'd through that in there as a guess what James might try and distract with next. Do you get my point yet? My point is a larger capacity battery through making battery and the phone thicker would make any phone have more battery life. I really hope you get the point this time as you seem to be the only one who can't comprehend this. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/013a3bd18bb4ffc1eba1ece1d07e1fe9b6aeb2639380ca6c9fe00b40e043e452.png james fuston > Of course, like more optimized software or more efficient parts. Hey look! After another 5 paragraphs he comes around to the same conclusion as the "delusional" guy. I'm looking forward to reading the next essay, keep em coming. Oh and keep posting screenshots of the up/downvotes you've enabled, it's highly entertaining. marcusmarcus2 Not picking out only parts of my response and ignoring what you don't want to address. I have not come to the same conclusion as you. Like I said I got your point about more efficient parts. But like I said, that has nothing to do with the point I was making. I won't explain it again, I've done so enough and if you don't get it by now, then you are either a special kind of stupid, smart but to suborn to admit your wrong, or a troll who successfully trolled me. I'm done reading your lack of intelligent responses. I'll let Bobby finish talking to you because I am done. http://pa1.narvii.com/5800/e40bec66da3b149914b3323a0a2d5e07bc96bce2_hq.gif https://m.popkey.co/765dfc/Re7oQ.gif JD The SE wasn't thinner. Ryne Hager Give me a OnePlus with 5000mAh and I would be so happy. someone755 Give me a 4.7" phone like the og Moto X and I would be so happy. Neither of us are going to be happy, Ryne. Drakenoid OG Moto X updated for current year would be perfect for me. Vlad I never broke a single headphone since I first had a smartphone in 2011 until I got a 5" phone. Since then, I need to buy new ones if I use one daily for more than 2 weeks, simply because sitting or walking up on stairs will break the cable thanks to the length of the phone. Upsides: 5" phone with 4100 mAh battery => amazing. And it's also thin as heck. Downsides: breaks headphones, bends, need to root for decent software (Xiaomi). Gimme back my 4.5" 720p screen, Motorola. Kristian Ivanov I highly agree on the thin phones part. Bought a Huawei P10 2 days ago, for me, that thing is unusable without a case to make it a bit fatter. Karly Johnston If they fix idle battery drain that doesn't become an issue. marcusmarcus2 I'm not saying they should not fix battery drain. I'm saying if they fix battery drain AND add higher capacity battery (making phone a little thicker), they could increase battery life even more than just addressing one of them. So if fixing the battery drain adds another day and a thicker battery adds another day, you'd go from 1 day to 3 days instead of just 2 days from only fixing battery drain. Karly Johnston The battery life the current 625 phones are getting is where flagships need to be. That should be enough for anyone. marcusmarcus2 Everyone is not all the same. It may be enough for you. I'm saying, phones are beyond thin enough and could be thicker to increase battery life even more beyond what a 625 phone can do. Now, this is my opinion in regards to how I would like to use a phone. You are welcome to your own opinion. I'm not going to say what should be enough for anyone other than me. Karly Johnston The OEMs don't think that is what the vast majority of people need or want. Their target is a full day of battery life which is what most people are worried about. It isn't my opinion, it is the industry opinion of what the marketing priorities are. X-47B My phone has 4000 mAh battery, and it's 5.5-inch display. I easily get 2 days of battery even after heavy usage. Margaritas Ante Porcos Installed O on my 6p and battery still drains like a whore in a bukkake twelvesome. Google really can't do nothing at this point. Android is breaking to pieces. So many things needed to be fixed in O but instead Android's got even worse. That notification empty desert area of white grey nothingness kills me the most. Hate it really bad. The last Android I liked was 6th. catalysto Not sure what you're talking about. Battery life on my 6P with the new O is great. Maybe you have an aging battery? Margaritas Ante Porcos as long as your 6p works great, nothing else matters, right? Roy That's right. catalysto Just saying. My anecdotal evidence is as good as yours. And having poor battery life across multiple OS versions is a pretty strong indicator for a bad battery, don't ya think? In fact, I had the same problem with a previous 6P. iFeign Complain some more about your beta software Margaritas Ante Porcos It started with 7.1.2. Do you really need to be a btch when bad things happen to others? Roy For me everything goes smooth on my 6P on 7.1.2. so I need to complain that Android to good. The Wrath of Kahn If your 6P has shut down even once before reaching about 5% then you most likely have one of the defective batteries. I had to have mine replaced, but after that, it runs all day like a charm. ODP2 improved it, if anything. Margaritas Ante Porcos it was fine for a long time until I updated to 7.1.2. That update screwed the battery that was working superb all the time. DANA Try to do a factory reset, it fixes many problem for some user. Margaritas Ante Porcos It was one of the first things I did. Twice. Did not help. Paul_Werner Yeah you got to call Google (if you got yours from the Play Store). They've been replacing 6Ps with factory refurbished ones even out of warranty (source: it happened to me) Matthew Skalecki The update didn't screw up your battery. The battery was going to crap out on you regardless of which Android version you had. This happened to many people including me. Replacing the battery fixes the issue; reverting to a previous os does nothing. Zach Mauch Did you go through Google or a local shop? The Wrath of Kahn Unfortunately it was out of warranty, had a friend with the skills do it for me. JD I need more of this colorful imagery to describe simple everyday problems. mchalakov First off you are using a beta OS don't complain. Second thing is that battery drain comes mostly from the (bad)apps - if you watched the video or read the article you could understand. Third - I'm pretty sure you can go back to Marshmallow if you are so so so unhappy with Nougat or O. Jakst Really? Yesterday was my first day with Android O. I plugged my phone out at 7, and come home at midnight with 35 % battery left. I've never had that kind of battery life in my 6P before. So I've seen huge gains with this O preview. thereasoner The Android O beta I'm using is so slow to charge my Pixel today that it seems like that's what they tackled​....and not in a good way. iFeign Surprise, surprise, you're running BETA software. Smh. thereasoner Yeah I know and I'm sure it will get fixed between now and September. I'm just saying that the current difference in charge time is quite noticable at this point. AbdulB1 maybe they removed quick charge support in beta mattcoz Pixel never had quick charge. AbdulB1 hmm interesting. I thought it has qualcomm processor so it must have qc 3.0 too. Must be some proprietary stuff or qualcomm must be asking for more money to enable it. mattcoz Google is pushing the open USB-C power delivery standard. AbdulB1 Display screen eats up most of my battery. I can't see what google is doing will fix it somehow. We need different types of screens now. iFeign Uhh, it's as if you expect things to use NO battery at all. Infinite battery life! Of course using the screen, aka, using the phone, is going to be the largest proportionate power drain - no matter how fancy the screen tech. AbdulB1 battery tech has still not improved and nor did the screen tech. I can accept that the screen tech will remain same for a long time but as far as batteries are concerned they can be improved , made for longer number of recharge cycles but that hasn't caught up with the manufacturers yet. One thing which can be done is increasing the battery capacity but we all know this is not happening as phone manufactures think it will make phones bulky , add weight and in long term affect the sale of newer devices. Latheryin Multi day battery life will not happen until new battery tech comes around. With people needlessly having screen on times of 5+ hours there is no way to keep a battery charged for extended periods. Krzysztof Jozwik I average 2 hours of screen on time a day. Just because some use their phone 24/7 doesn't mean we all do. I have a job where I'm not on my phone, at home I have better screens to get info from. The phone is there when I need it. Your nonstop use case is not the norm. Latheryin As do I but that is not the norm. Might want to look at any forum about battery life and looking at screen on times. Most want and use 5+ hours. It's mainly the older generation like us that doesn't need it and are not on the device all the time. Krzysztof Jozwik Obviously the forums about battery life have people winning that they want 48 hours of screen on. That is not the norm. Sure, lots of people want that, most do not. Latheryin Most want more screen on time. Why do you think battery life is such an issue. disqusdeeznuts My Moto Z Play begs to differ. Motorola does it right with this phone. It has a good size battery (3510), an efficient processor, and runs smooth. It can be done, but for some reason, it just isn't a focus for a majority of manufacturers. Latheryin Well sure all the devices with that mid range chip and battery combo can get ok battery life. I could easily. Get 2 days out of my device and it only has a 3200 battery. It is not the oem. It's people. They need to spend less time look at their phone and more time living life. Which many are unprepared for. Cakefish I'm going the leaked Moto X4 continues that legacy onwards! Rod Ever heard of the Moto z Play, or Lenovo P2? Latheryin As already stated on that. The moto has a mid tear chip. As for the Lenovo, nope. Can't say I have, it's either not sold in my country or a mid low tier device that I wouldn't have noticed. Just looked. They both use the same mid tier chip. Also that does have a good battery. But that like the K1000 with a 10000 battery are the exception and seldom are they flagship quality. WarpspeedScp The Moto z does not have an SD 820 on it. Neither does the P2. It's very annoying that manufacturers can't give us something functional instead of eye-candy for once. Rod While it's not top of line sillicon, real world testes have proven that, for everyday tasks, there's virtually no difference between the S625 ans 821 WarpspeedScp Well, my phone has an SD 650, and dolphin emulator just about keeps up (wind waker and super smash Bros). On an 820, there would definitely be better results. Paul Troy I have a better idea. Get the hardware manufacturers to put a bigger battery in their devices. 💡 Taedirk If we could convince hardware manufacturers to do something useful, we wouldn't be on yet another revision to how Android updates the OS. Alex Yeah so this way the horrible wakelocks (that Android makes almost impossible to manage) will be less visible. Cakefish Why not both? Zach Mauch All I want to know is can they stop wakelocks. JD Same bullshit every year. I'll believe it when I see it. Unless Android O somehow allows me to download more mAh. Morten Ulv Are you trying to say Android battery life hasn't improved VASTLY over the years? JD Yep in fact it's regressed Morten Ulv I have no such issues. Better battery all across the board. JD What ever you're smoking pass that shit around Morten Ulv Your shit must be stronger than mine. browngeek I miss the days of my Xperia Z3 Lollipop and Stamina mode. Used to get 48 hours and 5-6 hours SOT. D13H4RD2L1V3 I hope this actually does something when the final build is out. I'm getting tired of hearing of every new battery improvement in a new version of Android only to have a wakelock pretty much make all of that moot. Dennis Ulijn I am on the Android O beta, and i must say that the information i get from it it really useful! I never could find the wakelocks because i'm not rooted, but now i can easily see what apps use up battery in the background. Awake meditation app was in use for 15 minutes (meditation) and active in the background for 1 hour (basically, ever since the meditation)! "Restrict background usage" to on, and we'll see what it brings tomorrow. PI this is interesting .... :) ,, Whats the current update Dennis Ulijn I'm in Europe so I just woke up. I'll let you know end of the day. Dennis Ulijn k. End of the day here. The apps (pocketcasts and aware) behaved nicely now. at 23%, which is not that great with 2 hours of screen on time and 32% and 5%of the battery used up by system and services respectively. (apps 32%, system 32%, services 5%, Cell standby 3%, idle 2%, bluetooth and wifi 0%) PI System 32% ,,, ???? Dennis Ulijn Yeah, last weeks i had the bug where system was using a lot of battery... I don't care right now, because i'm not expecting good battery life while on a beta. I did find a fix for system battery usage on Reddit though, which is to reset app preferences (which mostly only resets permissions and things like default apps. PI When in fist saw it ,,I was like WTH 32% but then it's beta software ,,so we kinda expect it . Yes per app battery usage section with foreground and background Info is really great . But I suspect google play services and Android os battery section will not be effective that much unless they show wahts making them to suck up battery . Sabin Bajracharya Meanwhile Google's own apps will somehow be able to bypass this restriction :D Michael Sørensen Google's own location services, Now cards, Chrome, etc. eats the most battery for me - even worse with location history on. How about fixing that first...? WarpspeedScp Try Firefox! Also, turn location off as soon as you can. mlm5em But with O, you can now turn off Background activity on an app specific basis. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/eaaaef5de863733535628a24f5b0d44f888ae3ff0cb89d1c8cffc0680083c526.png mattcoz Good to see there's an option to turn it off. Morten Ulv Very handy! IncCo Anything that improves the battery life is awesome John Monks I have concerns about this. There are some apps I *want* running in the background, but I don't want them filling up the notification shade. One example, Lightflow has to have a pointless notification in order to do the job I installed it to do. I know it's there, any consequences for my battery life are mine to live with. It would be OK if I could toggle a setting to permit a particular app to run a 'free running background service' silently but this is Google so I expect I'll have to put up with spam instead (and no, collapsed notifications are still notifications), or there will be a toggle that does nothing, like the 'ignore optimisation' setting that currently exists. Drakenoid There apparently is, check comments above, there's a screenshot. David Onter You can disable all notifications from an app, which removes the permanent notification. Cakefish It's about damn time. All hail Android O. AdamH So does it mean my phone will be useless? something_new Apple was right then Đức Thành I'm beginning to get excited again, even knowing that actually achieving this would take many years. Fidelator Allow us, the end user, to have absolute control over which apps can run in the background under certain conditions, I have disabled notifications on Facebook and Instagram yet they still have multiple persistent RAM hogging battery sucking services 100% of the time smeddy My next phone won't get a look-in without a 4000mah+ battery in it. Since Samsung dropped the removable battery, battery anxiety has crept back into my life. abc Multi-day battery life? Ha! I solved this over a decade ago. The key to long battery life is having an actual life. Have friends and family and an active social life. Don't be the loser who keeps fiddling with his phone every few mins, when everyone already knows you don't get any important messages. You'll be amazed how long your battery lasts when you aren't pulling out to jerk off on it every few mins. And for god's sake, at home, a cell phone should be no different than a landline. If you're watching videos or playing games on your 5" inch screen, you need to invest in a PC or console. Sk0ly Good for Google. Some apps, particularly Facebook and Facebook messenger run ALWAYS in the background, even when you haven't used the applications in days. In my opinion, this is just lazy coding and is likely due to Facebook's data mining. In comparison, Hangouts and Allo only run on demand. Android has always allowed developers freedom to responsibly code their apps to allow them to do more. This is recognition that this freedom has been abused and now developers have to be treated more similarly to how they are on iOS.

SMS support for Hangouts officially ends today, excluding Google Voice and Project Fi subscribers Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/22 2:29pm PDTMay 22, 2017 64 Plus 1 on G+ 177 Share on Facebook 77 Share on Twitter Total Shares318 Applications Google News Videos Today is the day that Hangouts finally loses SMS support. We were warned by Google about it months ago when Hangouts started showing a warning that it would no longer support the feature. But, as of today, it's finally set to happen. For anyone that isn't on Project Fi or Google Voice — both of which will continue to support SMS in Hangouts — this is the end of an era. Many people, myself included, made the final push into Hangouts over other services when SMS support was added. The integrated conversations made it much easier to keep short communications together in one place. So far there's no word on if SMS support will be coming to Allo. Now that Hangouts support for SMS is finally over, we aren't really left with a clear migration method. Anyone that might have made use of it will have to either deal with using two separate apps again or move over to a new service. If you are looking for recommendations, Google's stock Android Messages isn't so bad. But, if you've been enjoying having SMS and chats merged, that isn't really a solution. Allo is always an option. But, that's the same issue from the other side, you'd still need to find a way to send SMS messages. There's always Facebook Messenger or Signal, which both provide a combined SMS and chat solution. Each has its disadvantages, though.  The latter doesn't have quite the same feature set that Hangouts did, and the former is a Facebook product. Either way, it's closing time. You might have just enough left to send one last SMS before the lights are shut off. If you still plan on using Hangouts for chats going forward, make sure you've updated to the latest version of over at Google Play or APKMirror. Download QR-Code Hangouts Developer: Google Inc.

Good_Ole_Pinocchio Google doesn't care about you. humulos A truer statement has never been said Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2c9aad5a41d09ce24c4c4e04e7b3a28a2004487ff015df2fc519b5c2a9556024.gif Adrien Aubel Google's messaging strategy is now: - Android Messages for carriers & OEMs - meaning strictly SMS/RCS - Allo for their new consumer messaging service, and the focus of their upcoming work - Hangouts for business/enterprise Nothing personal :) humulos How innocent we once were, at the time when we witnessed Talk, Voice, SMS and G+ Messages become a single product, fulfilling all our dreams. Undone in naught but a few years, with this final limb being ripped from the body. But I guess I'm on Project Fi, so I'm good for now. My parents weren't happy about this news, since our family communicates primarily on large Hangouts threads. mxwp but if they are using actual Hangouts IM threads and not SMS they can still use Hangouts Adrien Aubel IMHO those big plans haven't been followed by strict coding/design rules, and Hangouts became progressively a technical mess, then a true nightmare for anybody to work on, with the UI becoming slower with each version, fortunately partly compensated by faster phones. To be fair, SMS/MMS can be very complicated to deal with, and Android development was much harder and potentially messy when Babel has been developed, the technologies available nowadays would have helped a lot. So down the road it would have been neither productive or future-proof to keep iterating all efforts inside Hangouts, at least without a total recode from the ground up. Right now I wonder if they will indeed clean the code up to remove all carrier SMS/MMS, and eventually speed up the app and make it smaller, or just roughly disable it. t_newt If Hangouts became a technical mess, the solution isn't to drop Hangouts, it's to fix Hangouts. They could have made it a framework for their products that any of their messengers could be installed into. Instead they are trying to make it an enterprise Slack competitor. What company is going to trust their company to Google's leftovers? "SMS/MMS can be very complicated to deal with". Apparently this is true at Google. Duder12 They aren't getting the left overs. They are getting two brand new products. Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat. My name is…. Nobody ever used Hangouts for SMS outside America. Actually, nobidy uses SMS no more. There DOES exist a world outside America, you know, and its much bigger!! sproc Haha, you wish. Everyone I know is stuck on sms. They try whatsapp and stuff then abandon it. Adrien Aubel Especially iOS users, who already have a great "Messages" app that outsmarts SMS when possible. For them it doesn't make too much sense to download another messaging app every now and then. Rodrigo Gomes da Silva So.. where are you from? Jay No you wish, but you must be in the states. No one i know uses SMS anymore. It's an archaic dead service, only used for bank transaction notifications and amazon deliveries. Everyone else is either on whatsapp (yes 220 million of us in this country and growing at 4 million a month) or (wechat which is like what 85-90 percent of China) No one cares for SMS. TheDrunkenClam What an unnecessarily smug and nagging comment. Winston Well it's true, even if it's smug. Outside the US, SMS is pretty much dead as we've all moved towards WhatsApp, as carriers still don't give unlimited texts by default. I think it's time to start asking another company for SMS integration. Christopher Gannon That would work if so many people in the US weren't using iMessage, where the only way a non-apple user can chat is via SMS. Then apple makes it very difficult NOT to use it, so good luck convincing your friends to give up siri, etc. I'd also like a solution, like hangouts or iMessage, where messages aren't restricted to a phone, and I can seamlessly use both on my laptop, tablet or phone. Ryan Yes, but we still have all of the money. Magister Good for them. I live in us and everyone uses sms, so that's what I use. What everyone else uses is moot. Michael Sørensen Nonsense. I'm not in the US (Europe) and the VAST majority in my country still use SMS. Jason Hirsch I was very annoyed at having to add Hangouts as my SMS client. I couldn't keep separate separate anymore. Now in combination with Fi, GV, 2 phones and obi it's a nightmare. On this overseas trip i couldn't force Fi to dial via WiFi. So i had to go back and install Hangouts dialer. If they (Google) have a master plan there's no rhyme or reason to it. atc-tech Google Voice users should still be able to use it too, I think? I don't know. I switched the the updated GV app when it came out around the same time the hangouts DEintegration was announced, so I'm not sure, but I think Voice users still can... Aaron Berlin Who knows what the plan is long-term for GVoice in Hangouts, but the actual GVoice app is actually good now. No equivalent to the chrome extension/desktop app, though. Ryne Hager You are right, Google Voice users can also continue to receive SMS messages in the app, I'll make that more clear. atc-tech Cool. I wasn't sure GV still could, but I thought I remembered hearing that we could. I gave up already though and use the prettier new GV app... Wish they would add back more features though. Ryne Hager The new app is so pretty. I do wish my GV voicemails would show up in my call logs again, though. mxwp i exclusively use my GVoice number for calls and texts and use it on Hangouts. the update GVoice app has an annoying bug in that it tries to connect every account on your phone instead of just your main one. i have submitted it as a bug but have not heard anything back Tom Harman So when does Allo officially get SMS support, lol. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Same time it gets tablet support: Never. rndusrnm479461 Am I the only one who doesn't understand what's so good about SMS integration in either Allo or Hangouts? Is it really hard for you people to use 2 apps? Jesus christ. Google's "Android Messages" is lightweight anyway, why is it such a problem to use it? It shouldn't even eat much RAM. Kyle Gospodnetich Yes, yes you are. Please never work for Google, or really any company that has a hand in communications. My name is…. No, he is not Kyle Gospodnetich Congrats, now there's two of you idiots. iluvthesoftsoft One do-it-all app > two apps Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi, https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi, we're trying to fix texting on Android and provide transparent switch between SMS&IM (devices handshake when you get into chats so that we determine whether you or the recipient has poor reception and should prefer SMS for example). MJ Two apps? One app for SMS and than Facebook, WhatsApp, Allo/Hangouts, and whatever to cover all my contacts. SMS is the only thing I can message 100% of my contacts with. Adrien Aubel Google's messaging strategy is now: - Android Messages for carriers & OEMs - meaning strictly SMS/RCS - Allo for their new consumer messaging service, and the focus of their upcoming work - Hangouts for business/enterprise They can't risk to upset carrier and OEMs by implementing non-carrier features in Android Messages / the default SMS app they provide. Or at least it's a risk they're not ready to take at that time. Btw I wouldn't say "Android Messages" is that lightweight btw, notably on modern devices it could be so much smoother :( sam1331 I don't get it either. When Android Messages came out I switched my SMS over to it. I quickly realized I was using it almost exclusively for 2 factor verification codes. But really, the notifications all go to the same place, I already have to decide whether to use Hangouts or Facebook Messenger when talking to basically anyone anyway. I also think people should push a little harder to move conversations over from SMS to something else, I've never found that to be very difficult. mxwp SMS is convenient because you know it will work with any American with a cell phone... including "dumb" flip phones. And it actually is really difficult to get people to switch to another service. Apple users just use imessage to send their SMS to me. And then I send them my glorious green bubbles and those ishills can suck it. YaKillaCJ Sms integration is important because it is supported by 100% of telecommunications service providers and integrated on all devices that can make a phone call and has a screen. You can even sms a home phone without a screen depending on carrier/service provider. Thus it messaging that works with 100% of your contacts. Having multiple Apps spread across 100s of contacts is plain annoying. So if any App wants to be taken serious, it needs to be serious and have sms. What's App already fills the void for bypassing sms across the globe. rndusrnm479461 This answer makes the most sense. Thanks. Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi! play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi We're still new and young but we're very serious about our ambitions and not settling when we know it could/should be better. To fix texting on Android, we provide transparent switch between SMS&IM (devices handshake when you get into chats so that we determine whether you or the recipient has poor reception and should prefer SMS for example). Very handy in some countries/areas/events. And lets you reach *anybody* (that has a phone number). My name is…. Nobody uses SMS no more, and if i wanna send a text message to the last of the Mohicans, i will use my SMS app. I dont want no stupid integration and no stupid 'SMS fallback' that will make things worse. Chatting is not texting. YaKillaCJ There are only 2 widely used methods of messaging across mobile devices. Sms and What's App. Sms is supported on EVERY device from 2 way pagers and flip phones to house phones and smartphones. Any device that has a phone number supports sms. The majority of people doesn't care about added features like stickers and gif. We just care that all I need is the person phone number and from there I can call or text them. That's it. Bottom line is that it has to be a standard adopted by carriers on a worldwide scale. Hence what's app reason for such large scale use is it uses existing phone numbers for login, existing phone book for contact list, free, minimum data usage and encrypted. Even that is still not even used by a third of the devices that use sms. Ryuuie Last I checked, WhatsApp charged $1 or someshit. erptastic It has not done that officially for years. And even before that, they always just extended my account. disqus_Xz3y8OiO3O It's free mxwp in the larger scheme of things, I agree with you that it is not a big deal. still, having one app do both was convenient. the other complaint is Android fanboys being envious of iMessage, which Hangouts could have become. exadeci The main reason that people use Imessage is that you get rich messaging capabilities out of the box if the person you are talking to has an Iphone everything is abstracted, you add someone's number and you start chatting right aways no need to exchange accounts id's or find which app you both use. And if the other doesn't have an Iphone you can still message them or if you killed your data plan it sends an sms. But Google doesn't add sms support because they are pushing for RCS which is a GOOD thing: Standalone Messaging 1-to-1 Chat Group Chat File Transfer Content Sharing Social Presence Information IP Voice call Best Effort Video call Geolocation Exchange Audio Messaging Network based blacklist Capability Exchange based on Presence or SIP OPTIONS All this WITHOUT using any data, data needs an link to be established this doesn't. Chris Hannan It's not hard for most of us to use it. The problem is the people we contact don't want to use separate apps. Everyone with iPhones uses iMessage because it just works by default. But barely anybody I know uses Hangouts and nobody I know uses Allo. If it was all built into one app that shipped with Android phones, more people would use it. Troy Leonard and I removed Hangouts as of today I will no longer consider using any google messaging service ever again Sruly J Isn't Gmail a form of messaging? (Or do you not use Gmail?) Troy Leonard Not for long I'm transitioning over to outlook.com. And upgrading my phone to an iPhone. I'm sick of slow to no updates on my phone,and done with Google ruining everything I ever liked about their apps and Android. naysayer Good riddance. Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi), a new app that we're making that brings a lot of the goodies iMessage brings to iOS users, with big long-term ambitions, and still trying to preserve a consistent and sleek UI. Hopefully that will make you stick to Android and you'll make your iPhone friends jealous in a few months/years ;) Zsolt V Why bother evangilizing? He already decided Outlook on an iPhone is better than Gmail, so let him enjoy it. Troy Leonard Your link is broken Adrien Aubel Fixed thanks! Disqus didn't like the closing ')' at the end of the link. XgudwilX eww outloook😲 Total Insecurity Saying "upgrading my phone to an iPhone" is the same as converting from atheism to any religion. Just a downgrade. bekifft It's true, and their failings and obvious ulterior motives in messaging have, for the first time in a decade, made me consider moving my email back to a private service over which I have control. Roy Thank you and have a nice flight. -Matoro Zeliph- Just want to make sure I'm not missing anything. So Google Voice SMS will no longer work too? Corbin Davenport That will still work as well. Ryne Hager Google voice will still work, just like Fi. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ It's primarily that regular SMS will no longer function in the app. A while back they killed of threading of SMS/MMS and Hangout messages, and now they are killing SMS/MMS entirely out of the app and suggestin people to switch to Android Messages. Bill Blandford Hangouts SMS looks like it still works for Google Voice SMS too. Essentially, this is like Fi, which is a Google Voice number at heart. My wifi-only-device kids use Hangouts to call and text with a Google Voice #. Timmy Turner Yeah GV will continue to work through Hangouts since the number you use via Project-Fi is a GV given number. Adrien Aubel For people that were still using Hangouts and want to try a new app that also does SMS & IM, that tries to provide a fast & polished experience to fix texting on Android, I'd love some honest feedback! https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi We're trying hard to "make it right" and have so much planned on the roadmap, so any feedback is great to have to tweak things up. Let us know what you think! exadeci While the initiative is nice, why would we use your messaging app? If I want an instant message app that does sms and that no one else uses I already got Signal and at least Signal is proven to be secure. What makes Messenger (Facebook), WhatsApp and Imessage good? Their userbase. Ask anyone for a way to communicate and they will use one of those apps, no need for fallback sms when everyone has an account. Adrien Aubel Thanks for your feedback @exadeci:disqus! Great questions :) And Signal is nice as well! It's not for everybody but if you're happy with it keep using it but make sure to check us out in a few months to check that you haven't been missing out, we're going fast! I think there's much more to iMessage that makes it good than their userbase. It is a polished app that just works, and lets you reach anybody, therefore becoming your trusted "go to" texting app. We expect Google to release this summer new capabilities that will let you use IM in more scenarios. Very interesting stuff that we can't wait to let our users benefit from. But our initial target is actually SMS users, people that unlike you and I don't really care about the details, they just want a reliable app that sends and receive their messages. And they're actually quite happy with SMS/MMS in that regard, it just works (when you don't fight with APNs, something we try to prevent as well). We want to transparently "upgrade" those users that may be using Android Messages or a 3rd party app custom-made for the carrier or OEM, not necessarily developed with great care and polishment, and sometimes truly terrible (really, you wouldn't believe what's on some popular carriers, that most users end up using 10 times a day for years). Right now invi is mostly upgrading the transport of your messages and general experience as we develop another big focus of ours: bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages exchanged being plain text. Texting can be the most impersonal way of communication and this flattens relationships. A bar suggests as you type relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps you transmit how you truly felt when writing this message, it doesn't flatten as much your emotions (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). It always send instantly over IM as well (no upload or anything like that, optimized WebP images for super-fast download). Open your top 3 chats on Signal, chats that you have with people you care the most about, look at all this flat plain texting, and try to visualize the gap compared to what it could be, how it could have been more personal and transmitting more of your feelings or emotions. We're targeting this gap, and again, we're just getting started but have serious ambitions and motivation. If you use Snapchat, look at all that rich media that gets thrown to your eyes or that you throw to people, that doesn't always make sense and is often disconnected from conversations, sometimes losing its value and feeling like you just threw a bottle in the ocean, just leaving you with a list of who saw it. We're looking at that gap as well, as invi becomes more and more rich in terms of content creation. After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. We are in talks with some OEMs and resellers to make invi default which would help grow invi's user base and help us improve our product with more diverse usage, while some upcoming features of invi should ultimately help us get a lot more users naturally. exadeci Signal has actually Gifs from Giphy, stickers and the possibility to send a location but I don't use this kind of feature even on Messenger it's quite rare that I send a sticker. Google is strongly pushing for RCS adoption which would add all these emotions sharing: https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Rogers_Google_RCS.gif https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Telenor_6P_GIF_0UHHQdI.gif https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/RCS_Android_Update.width-600.png Adrien Aubel Exactly, but how relevant is Giphy? Again don't compare with things you've seen so far but with what it could potentially be if it truly understood your relationships and intentions, if it combined that with your taste and the way you usually communicate with this specific person. And what if your friends or other people were able to add their own media and stickers through channels and then be discovered, liked and followed, with deep intelligence powering it all and bringing the right content to the right user? We built invi to support all this, we don't just use a Giphy API, we used the most advanced and lightweight technologies to communicate in realtime with our backend, even on pretty bad 3G, from where we curate the media that eventually gets recommended to you. The screenshots you attached look great as well, but see Android Messages is a good example there's only 5 packs of stickers that won't get more relevant or smarter no matter how many stickers you use or how many times you use Android Messages. Idk who would use a given sticker hundreds of times, but anyway I'm not sure those were really representative of how Android Messages is most commonly used. The features are technically there, as often, but they're very limited in their potential as of now. The Awesome Bar isn't for everyone but can eventually help people like you, as images just get displayed while you're typing, no action required, and if you see one that you like you can just tap it to see how it looks and enrich your message, send and you're done. Google is pushing RCS, very true! And we're excited about the great work the Jibe team did in the past couple years. They're a bit shy to share their RCS client implementation at the moment, it may be unstable or not well documented at the moment, but we're meeting regularly with Google and hope to add RCS to our transparent switch as soon as possible, even though the user base is a bit limited at the moment it has the potential to grow fast and solve many issues. If they're reluctant for too long we may use other hubs that would communicate seamlessly through Unified Profile. But for now, we're watching the number of users actually benefiting from RCS grow while we focus on other areas of improvements. sam1331 I am actually kind of optimistic about all this, more so than I was maybe a year ago. They've been putting out a steady stream or improvements to Allo, and when I've experimented with it with a friend it actually is an enjoyable experience. Releasing it without a web app is just shocking, but if that's added and it works well, I could totally see moving over to it from Hangouts, where I do the vast majority of my communicating. The other piece of the puzzle is Duo. If they can integrate a Duo button in Allo conversations (like it seems they will), and they eventually add group calling, which can't be that far off, then I think it will be a nice solution for myself and my family. And I've got quite a few friends that are all about Android instead of iOS, so I can see them switching to Allo from Hangouts. But not until there is a web app, because they aren't stupid. Chad Knasinski I would use Allo if they added SMS support and a desktop version like Hangouts had. Nick.Trite Same here. I have Fi so I'll continue to use Hangouts for SMS. I really love the fact that I can switch seamlessly from desktop to mobile and still be sending SMS. Until Allo does that, I won't consider moving. Chad Knasinski Ditto Sir_Brizz And multi-device support. Can't even use it or sync it on my LTE Tablet... Carson Saldanha So, basically Hangouts but revamped? We've come in full-circle. Sir_Brizz Sure. The problem is that every other chat platform has these features in 2016. Including Hangouts. Roy Me to, love it. mxwp unless they remove hangouts from gmail, people will still secretly be using "hangouts" all the time. in fact, the only way Allo will ever take off without SMS is if it replaces Hangouts (gtalk) on gmail and inbox. Chad Knasinski So correct me if I am wrong here but Google wants us to do this with our messages: SMS - Google Messenger Business SMS - Hangouts Messages - Allo Facebook - Messenger Video Chat - Duo Business Video Chat - Hangouts Video Really? Are you kidding me here? Timmy Turner You've got it right and if there's a joke, you'll being waiting a while for the punchline. disqus_em5YfkbWdk What Business SMS and how is 8t different from other SMS? Zsolt V What does Facebook have to do with anything you wrote? So you are corrected. SpadeX Are you new to tech world? Timmy Turner I recommend Textra to anyone looking for a new SMS app. Sleek, customizable and continually updated/supported. Adrien Aubel Textra is very nice, notably customization-wise as you said, you can go deep and fine-tune basically any UX element. And it's super fast and lightweight as well. I am working as well on a new SMS app that also provides IM similarly to iMessage on iPhone, and many other features, most of them upcoming though. Would you mind giving me a honest feedback when you have the time? It's called invi on the Play Store https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi Timmy Turner Sure thing. freshprince_87 That invi SMS app is an awesome app. Near flawless app. but I stop using it because I kept having problems with MMS messages and also it just like Allo in the sense where if you uninstall the app and reinstall it on the same phone all your instant messages are all gone including some of the regular SMS /MMS messages. You need to make the app save all your messages on to an account like a Google account in the cloud. So that no matter what device you use the instant messages will still be there. Adrien Aubel @freshprince_87:disqus Thank you for your feedback! MMS can be very tricky and every carrier has its own set of specificities, I'm sorry about that, it shows we're still young but obviously like you said, such a core functionality bug makes our whole effort worthless for you here. Do you mind sharing your carrier, device model, and Android version? Did you try using "Legacy MMS" in the app settings? About the IM sync, that's an issue we're definitely looking into, considering all potential security and privacy issues, notably as some countries like USA recycle pretty aggressively your phone numbers, and with the desire to bring a Web client in mind. Google should announce this summer APIs that will eventually help us regarding security, so stay tuned :) freshprince_87 Thanks. I didn't use the legacy MMS. I hope that you add the IM sync soon. I'm on a T-Mobile service using the Moto Z Play on Android Nougat 7.0 Adrien Aubel Ok thank you, if you don't mind I have other questions to dive into your problem :) What specifically was failing? MMS sending, receiving, or both? Did it show an error? Is it only on group MMS or all MMS? Whatever information you may have will be helpful. Our next release should bring MMS reliability improvements and notably Wifi texting when supported by the carrier (first MMS may send up to 60s to send as we're trying out routes but then all other Wifi MMS should send very fast). Tom Westrick https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5ecvBaqHBk MJ Thank God I use Project Fi otherwise this would suck big time for me. TJ Mills Thank God I have Google voice.... Dracono Love hangouts never used SMS. It also seems most negative reviews about it being slow was always tired to the SMS feature. I'm now curious with the removal of they'll us the opportunity to evolve or let it idle. mxwp it will evolve into a business app... but hopefully still available for consumers VAVAMk_2 Just give us SMS support in Allo for Christ's sake! Adrien Aubel SMS/MMS can be quite hard to deal with technically and Google didn't choose to go that way. It is possibly also due to the push they did to replace the default SMS app on many OEMs and carriers, strategically it's hard for them to push much of Google's agenda through the SMS app they give carriers, and they're mostly limited to SMS/RCS. Roy Christ will not give you SMS, bat Star of David could promise you RCS in Allo. mxwp Big G repeatedly stated it would never happen tim242 Liar. Adrien Aubel https://twitter.com/amitfulay/status/840236304130428928 Roy Great. It's was the plan all along. Now Allow will get RCS and web browser everything gonna integrate with Duo. I'm all the way in. I never like Hangout. I love Allo. #stop stop babies don't you cry. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I don't think that's possible. RCS is still mainly just an extension of SMS. If it doesn't support SMS, I don't see it handling RCS. Roy When RCS will come it will be with SMS already. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Based on what? Besnik Rrustemi No problem guys,we have like 69 other Messaging Apps by Google to choose from and maybe 2 new others coming soon. Roy Haha it's so old. Can someone can come with new jokes here? Besnik Rrustemi Well sorry Old Man then, never knew your age before. * Respect for Old People * Sir_Brizz Let the confusion officially begin! Indianajonze google can go fk themselves Robert Gerhart Why isn't anybody asking the bigger question: why the hell does anyone use outdated SMS in the first place? It's like complaining that Hangouts doesn't integrate butter churns and wagon wheels either. There is nothing more annoying than a text message. Adrien Aubel SMS is always nice to have in some situations, that happen more or less depending on where you live. Uncovered areas, concerts or big games, people having no LTE-enabled plans, or simply on some roads and highways. In USA for example all those scenarios happen a lot, notably in some states. And eventually, in most countries you still use SMS for 3rd party services, banks, transportation, or even government-related messages. Most importantly, in countries that still use SMS you can reach *anybody you know* from one app. And that's really a great thing to have. Now you're right, IM is so much more pleasant. Instant delivery, read status, last active time, way faster image format and transport. At invi ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi ) we try to take advantage of this and combine both the way it should be. When you open a chat with somebody, we trigger a handshake to check that both you and the recipient are well connected. If one of both doesn't answer on time, it simply switches to SMS/MMS, it's automatic and out of your way. Otherwise you take advantage of state-of-the-art transport with some unique optimizations. Try to send a GIF over IM and see how fast it goes, compared to MMS or even Whatsapp. Let me know what you think! Aaron Simple; SMS is ubiquitous. Every cellular device in operation can send and receive SMS, from the most current and expensive flagships like the iPhone and Galaxy, to the cheapest budget devices, all the way down to the oldest flip phones. I can text my dad on his flip, my wife on her Nexus or my Capt on his iPhone and each one will receive that message and reply. Show me an IM that can do all of that (that isn't on the iPhone). I guess that invi app that guy's been pedaling might, but I'm waiting for it to gain some traction before trying to convince anybody to switch to yet another IM. Rod The rest of the world uses Whatsapp, everyone has it installed. JG Even people with generic flip phones? Rod Nope, but I don't remember the last time I saw someone with a flip phone. The poor now bear Galaxy Win/Pocket/etc JG My aunt still has one. She recently attempted to upgrade to a smartphone but that seems to have failed big time... Apparently my telling her to tap the icon that's labeled "EMAIL" to get her email is too complicated... That and the free phone she got is a PoS... 512MB of RAM and only 4GB of storage - with the OS consuming all but like 100MB there of. So it didn't perform quite so hot. She seemed a bit surprised her free phone didn't perform as well as my Pixel XL does... TJ Mills Everyone in China uses Wi chat. Rod USA is a world apart. lomsha Believe it or not, even 2g is still a luxury in some countries, which makes​ instant messaging iffy. In those cases sms is a great alternative. Not everyone is in the 1st world with a sweet smartphone and reliable data access. TJ Mills Standard is better than better. When someone comes up with a universal replacement that works on all classes of phones, then the world can switch. Until then it's a mishmash of services and applications​to communicate. Why does everyone still use email? Because of the standards. Michael Sørensen Convince me why I shouldn't... Currently I can write to anyone for free without first asking them what their preferred platform is. And they can reply for free regardless of said preferred platform. Again, convince me why that's not good enough? And don't say "stickers". Just don't. Security? Bah, no sensitive information sent. Midnitte At this point, I'm held hostage stuck using Hangouts since it's the only thing that natively supports desktop messaging. Sigh. Lord Argyris "Each has its disadvantages, though. The latter doesn't have quite the same feature set that Hangouts did, and the former is a Facebook product." It's lines like these that keep.me coming back to AP. JD My support for Google and their messaging platforms ended the beginning of May. Kelly Clubb Well this sucks for any user that enjoyed an easy to use sms app. I use Hangouts and thankfully for project fi will continue it's support BossMa1n3 Eh..doesn't effect me stop using hangout for sms awhile ago..more interested in a flat screen phone with side bezels as thin as the one in the pic.. Grey PLEASE Bring Hangouts Chat and Hangouts Meet to all users. That has so many new and awesome features. It's like everything Allo isn't. DragoCubed The comment section is rough b_boogey_xl Bye Hangouts! hp-fourtwenty oh ffs...voice is still supported??? hell yeah!! nxtiak I'm waiting for the day G+ contacts disappear from Hangouts.

SMS support for Hangouts officially ends today, excluding Google Voice and Project Fi subscribers Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/22 2:29pm PDTMay 22, 2017 64 Plus 1 on G+ 177 Share on Facebook 77 Share on Twitter Total Shares318 Applications Google News Videos Today is the day that Hangouts finally loses SMS support. We were warned by Google about it months ago when Hangouts started showing a warning that it would no longer support the feature. But, as of today, it's finally set to happen. For anyone that isn't on Project Fi or Google Voice — both of which will continue to support SMS in Hangouts — this is the end of an era. Many people, myself included, made the final push into Hangouts over other services when SMS support was added. The integrated conversations made it much easier to keep short communications together in one place. So far there's no word on if SMS support will be coming to Allo. Now that Hangouts support for SMS is finally over, we aren't really left with a clear migration method. Anyone that might have made use of it will have to either deal with using two separate apps again or move over to a new service. If you are looking for recommendations, Google's stock Android Messages isn't so bad. But, if you've been enjoying having SMS and chats merged, that isn't really a solution. Allo is always an option. But, that's the same issue from the other side, you'd still need to find a way to send SMS messages. There's always Facebook Messenger or Signal, which both provide a combined SMS and chat solution. Each has its disadvantages, though.  The latter doesn't have quite the same feature set that Hangouts did, and the former is a Facebook product. Either way, it's closing time. You might have just enough left to send one last SMS before the lights are shut off. If you still plan on using Hangouts for chats going forward, make sure you've updated to the latest version of over at Google Play or APKMirror. Download QR-Code Hangouts Developer: Google Inc.

JVF When referring to people it is always "Hanged", sounds funny but that's just how it is. It's a past participle. Ryne Hager Yup, I know. That was the joke. 4Ui812 I understand what you're saying and I debated the proper way to put it..... I have to stand by hanged. instinct I am like 6 different active group chats in Hangouts. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Google doesn't care about you. humulos A truer statement has never been said Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2c9aad5a41d09ce24c4c4e04e7b3a28a2004487ff015df2fc519b5c2a9556024.gif Adrien Aubel Google's messaging strategy is now: - Android Messages for carriers & OEMs - meaning strictly SMS/RCS - Allo for their new consumer messaging service, and the focus of their upcoming work - Hangouts for business/enterprise Nothing personal :) humulos How innocent we once were, at the time when we witnessed Talk, Voice, SMS and G+ Messages become a single product, fulfilling all our dreams. Undone in naught but a few years, with this final limb being ripped from the body. But I guess I'm on Project Fi, so I'm good for now. My parents weren't happy about this news, since our family communicates primarily on large Hangouts threads. mxwp but if they are using actual Hangouts IM threads and not SMS they can still use Hangouts Adrien Aubel IMHO those big plans haven't been followed by strict coding/design rules, and Hangouts became progressively a technical mess, then a true nightmare for anybody to work on, with the UI becoming slower with each version, fortunately partly compensated by faster phones. To be fair, SMS/MMS can be very complicated to deal with, and Android development was much harder and potentially messy when Babel has been developed, the technologies available nowadays would have helped a lot. So down the road it would have been neither productive or future-proof to keep iterating all efforts inside Hangouts, at least without a total recode from the ground up. Right now I wonder if they will indeed clean the code up to remove all carrier SMS/MMS, and eventually speed up the app and make it smaller, or just roughly disable it. t_newt If Hangouts became a technical mess, the solution isn't to drop Hangouts, it's to fix Hangouts. They could have made it a framework for their products that any of their messengers could be installed into. Instead they are trying to make it an enterprise Slack competitor. What company is going to trust their company to Google's leftovers? "SMS/MMS can be very complicated to deal with". Apparently this is true at Google. Duder12 They aren't getting the left overs. They are getting two brand new products. Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat. My name is…. Nobody ever used Hangouts for SMS outside America. Actually, nobidy uses SMS no more. There DOES exist a world outside America, you know, and its much bigger!! sproc Haha, you wish. Everyone I know is stuck on sms. They try whatsapp and stuff then abandon it. Adrien Aubel Especially iOS users, who already have a great "Messages" app that outsmarts SMS when possible. For them it doesn't make too much sense to download another messaging app every now and then. Rodrigo Gomes da Silva So.. where are you from? Jay No you wish, but you must be in the states. No one i know uses SMS anymore. It's an archaic dead service, only used for bank transaction notifications and amazon deliveries. Everyone else is either on whatsapp (yes 220 million of us in this country and growing at 4 million a month) or (wechat which is like what 85-90 percent of China) No one cares for SMS. TheDrunkenClam What an unnecessarily smug and nagging comment. Winston Well it's true, even if it's smug. Outside the US, SMS is pretty much dead as we've all moved towards WhatsApp, as carriers still don't give unlimited texts by default. I think it's time to start asking another company for SMS integration. Christopher Gannon That would work if so many people in the US weren't using iMessage, where the only way a non-apple user can chat is via SMS. Then apple makes it very difficult NOT to use it, so good luck convincing your friends to give up siri, etc. I'd also like a solution, like hangouts or iMessage, where messages aren't restricted to a phone, and I can seamlessly use both on my laptop, tablet or phone. Ryan Yes, but we still have all of the money. Magister Good for them. I live in us and everyone uses sms, so that's what I use. What everyone else uses is moot. Michael Sørensen Nonsense. I'm not in the US (Europe) and the VAST majority in my country still use SMS. Jason Hirsch I was very annoyed at having to add Hangouts as my SMS client. I couldn't keep separate separate anymore. Now in combination with Fi, GV, 2 phones and obi it's a nightmare. On this overseas trip i couldn't force Fi to dial via WiFi. So i had to go back and install Hangouts dialer. If they (Google) have a master plan there's no rhyme or reason to it. atc-tech Google Voice users should still be able to use it too, I think? I don't know. I switched the the updated GV app when it came out around the same time the hangouts DEintegration was announced, so I'm not sure, but I think Voice users still can... Aaron Berlin Who knows what the plan is long-term for GVoice in Hangouts, but the actual GVoice app is actually good now. No equivalent to the chrome extension/desktop app, though. Ryne Hager You are right, Google Voice users can also continue to receive SMS messages in the app, I'll make that more clear. atc-tech Cool. I wasn't sure GV still could, but I thought I remembered hearing that we could. I gave up already though and use the prettier new GV app... Wish they would add back more features though. Ryne Hager The new app is so pretty. I do wish my GV voicemails would show up in my call logs again, though. mxwp i exclusively use my GVoice number for calls and texts and use it on Hangouts. the update GVoice app has an annoying bug in that it tries to connect every account on your phone instead of just your main one. i have submitted it as a bug but have not heard anything back Tom Harman So when does Allo officially get SMS support, lol. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Same time it gets tablet support: Never. rndusrnm479461 Am I the only one who doesn't understand what's so good about SMS integration in either Allo or Hangouts? Is it really hard for you people to use 2 apps? Jesus christ. Google's "Android Messages" is lightweight anyway, why is it such a problem to use it? It shouldn't even eat much RAM. Kyle Gospodnetich Yes, yes you are. Please never work for Google, or really any company that has a hand in communications. My name is…. No, he is not Kyle Gospodnetich Congrats, now there's two of you idiots. iluvthesoftsoft One do-it-all app > two apps Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi, https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi, we're trying to fix texting on Android and provide transparent switch between SMS&IM (devices handshake when you get into chats so that we determine whether you or the recipient has poor reception and should prefer SMS for example). MJ Two apps? One app for SMS and than Facebook, WhatsApp, Allo/Hangouts, and whatever to cover all my contacts. SMS is the only thing I can message 100% of my contacts with. Adrien Aubel Google's messaging strategy is now: - Android Messages for carriers & OEMs - meaning strictly SMS/RCS - Allo for their new consumer messaging service, and the focus of their upcoming work - Hangouts for business/enterprise They can't risk to upset carrier and OEMs by implementing non-carrier features in Android Messages / the default SMS app they provide. Or at least it's a risk they're not ready to take at that time. Btw I wouldn't say "Android Messages" is that lightweight btw, notably on modern devices it could be so much smoother :( sam1331 I don't get it either. When Android Messages came out I switched my SMS over to it. I quickly realized I was using it almost exclusively for 2 factor verification codes. But really, the notifications all go to the same place, I already have to decide whether to use Hangouts or Facebook Messenger when talking to basically anyone anyway. I also think people should push a little harder to move conversations over from SMS to something else, I've never found that to be very difficult. mxwp SMS is convenient because you know it will work with any American with a cell phone... including "dumb" flip phones. And it actually is really difficult to get people to switch to another service. Apple users just use imessage to send their SMS to me. And then I send them my glorious green bubbles and those ishills can suck it. YaKillaCJ Sms integration is important because it is supported by 100% of telecommunications service providers and integrated on all devices that can make a phone call and has a screen. You can even sms a home phone without a screen depending on carrier/service provider. Thus it messaging that works with 100% of your contacts. Having multiple Apps spread across 100s of contacts is plain annoying. So if any App wants to be taken serious, it needs to be serious and have sms. What's App already fills the void for bypassing sms across the globe. rndusrnm479461 This answer makes the most sense. Thanks. Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi! play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi We're still new and young but we're very serious about our ambitions and not settling when we know it could/should be better. To fix texting on Android, we provide transparent switch between SMS&IM (devices handshake when you get into chats so that we determine whether you or the recipient has poor reception and should prefer SMS for example). Very handy in some countries/areas/events. And lets you reach *anybody* (that has a phone number). My name is…. Nobody uses SMS no more, and if i wanna send a text message to the last of the Mohicans, i will use my SMS app. I dont want no stupid integration and no stupid 'SMS fallback' that will make things worse. Chatting is not texting. YaKillaCJ There are only 2 widely used methods of messaging across mobile devices. Sms and What's App. Sms is supported on EVERY device from 2 way pagers and flip phones to house phones and smartphones. Any device that has a phone number supports sms. The majority of people doesn't care about added features like stickers and gif. We just care that all I need is the person phone number and from there I can call or text them. That's it. Bottom line is that it has to be a standard adopted by carriers on a worldwide scale. Hence what's app reason for such large scale use is it uses existing phone numbers for login, existing phone book for contact list, free, minimum data usage and encrypted. Even that is still not even used by a third of the devices that use sms. Ryuuie Last I checked, WhatsApp charged $1 or someshit. erptastic It has not done that officially for years. And even before that, they always just extended my account. disqus_Xz3y8OiO3O It's free mxwp in the larger scheme of things, I agree with you that it is not a big deal. still, having one app do both was convenient. the other complaint is Android fanboys being envious of iMessage, which Hangouts could have become. exadeci The main reason that people use Imessage is that you get rich messaging capabilities out of the box if the person you are talking to has an Iphone everything is abstracted, you add someone's number and you start chatting right aways no need to exchange accounts id's or find which app you both use. And if the other doesn't have an Iphone you can still message them or if you killed your data plan it sends an sms. But Google doesn't add sms support because they are pushing for RCS which is a GOOD thing: Standalone Messaging 1-to-1 Chat Group Chat File Transfer Content Sharing Social Presence Information IP Voice call Best Effort Video call Geolocation Exchange Audio Messaging Network based blacklist Capability Exchange based on Presence or SIP OPTIONS All this WITHOUT using any data, data needs an link to be established this doesn't. Chris Hannan It's not hard for most of us to use it. The problem is the people we contact don't want to use separate apps. Everyone with iPhones uses iMessage because it just works by default. But barely anybody I know uses Hangouts and nobody I know uses Allo. If it was all built into one app that shipped with Android phones, more people would use it. Troy Leonard and I removed Hangouts as of today I will no longer consider using any google messaging service ever again Sruly J Isn't Gmail a form of messaging? (Or do you not use Gmail?) Troy Leonard Not for long I'm transitioning over to outlook.com. And upgrading my phone to an iPhone. I'm sick of slow to no updates on my phone,and done with Google ruining everything I ever liked about their apps and Android. naysayer Good riddance. Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi), a new app that we're making that brings a lot of the goodies iMessage brings to iOS users, with big long-term ambitions, and still trying to preserve a consistent and sleek UI. Hopefully that will make you stick to Android and you'll make your iPhone friends jealous in a few months/years ;) Zsolt V Why bother evangilizing? He already decided Outlook on an iPhone is better than Gmail, so let him enjoy it. Troy Leonard Your link is broken Adrien Aubel Fixed thanks! Disqus didn't like the closing ')' at the end of the link. XgudwilX eww outloook😲 Total Insecurity Saying "upgrading my phone to an iPhone" is the same as converting from atheism to any religion. Just a downgrade. bekifft It's true, and their failings and obvious ulterior motives in messaging have, for the first time in a decade, made me consider moving my email back to a private service over which I have control. Roy Thank you and have a nice flight. -Matoro Zeliph- Just want to make sure I'm not missing anything. So Google Voice SMS will no longer work too? Corbin Davenport That will still work as well. Ryne Hager Google voice will still work, just like Fi. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ It's primarily that regular SMS will no longer function in the app. A while back they killed of threading of SMS/MMS and Hangout messages, and now they are killing SMS/MMS entirely out of the app and suggestin people to switch to Android Messages. Bill Blandford Hangouts SMS looks like it still works for Google Voice SMS too. Essentially, this is like Fi, which is a Google Voice number at heart. My wifi-only-device kids use Hangouts to call and text with a Google Voice #. Timmy Turner Yeah GV will continue to work through Hangouts since the number you use via Project-Fi is a GV given number. Adrien Aubel For people that were still using Hangouts and want to try a new app that also does SMS & IM, that tries to provide a fast & polished experience to fix texting on Android, I'd love some honest feedback! https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi We're trying hard to "make it right" and have so much planned on the roadmap, so any feedback is great to have to tweak things up. Let us know what you think! exadeci While the initiative is nice, why would we use your messaging app? If I want an instant message app that does sms and that no one else uses I already got Signal and at least Signal is proven to be secure. What makes Messenger (Facebook), WhatsApp and Imessage good? Their userbase. Ask anyone for a way to communicate and they will use one of those apps, no need for fallback sms when everyone has an account. Adrien Aubel Thanks for your feedback @exadeci:disqus! Great questions :) And Signal is nice as well! It's not for everybody but if you're happy with it keep using it but make sure to check us out in a few months to check that you haven't been missing out, we're going fast! I think there's much more to iMessage that makes it good than their userbase. It is a polished app that just works, and lets you reach anybody, therefore becoming your trusted "go to" texting app. We expect Google to release this summer new capabilities that will let you use IM in more scenarios. Very interesting stuff that we can't wait to let our users benefit from. But our initial target is actually SMS users, people that unlike you and I don't really care about the details, they just want a reliable app that sends and receive their messages. And they're actually quite happy with SMS/MMS in that regard, it just works (when you don't fight with APNs, something we try to prevent as well). We want to transparently "upgrade" those users that may be using Android Messages or a 3rd party app custom-made for the carrier or OEM, not necessarily developed with great care and polishment, and sometimes truly terrible (really, you wouldn't believe what's on some popular carriers, that most users end up using 10 times a day for years). Right now invi is mostly upgrading the transport of your messages and general experience as we develop another big focus of ours: bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages exchanged being plain text. Texting can be the most impersonal way of communication and this flattens relationships. A bar suggests as you type relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps you transmit how you truly felt when writing this message, it doesn't flatten as much your emotions (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). It always send instantly over IM as well (no upload or anything like that, optimized WebP images for super-fast download). Open your top 3 chats on Signal, chats that you have with people you care the most about, look at all this flat plain texting, and try to visualize the gap compared to what it could be, how it could have been more personal and transmitting more of your feelings or emotions. We're targeting this gap, and again, we're just getting started but have serious ambitions and motivation. If you use Snapchat, look at all that rich media that gets thrown to your eyes or that you throw to people, that doesn't always make sense and is often disconnected from conversations, sometimes losing its value and feeling like you just threw a bottle in the ocean, just leaving you with a list of who saw it. We're looking at that gap as well, as invi becomes more and more rich in terms of content creation. After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. We are in talks with some OEMs and resellers to make invi default which would help grow invi's user base and help us improve our product with more diverse usage, while some upcoming features of invi should ultimately help us get a lot more users naturally. exadeci Signal has actually Gifs from Giphy, stickers and the possibility to send a location but I don't use this kind of feature even on Messenger it's quite rare that I send a sticker. Google is strongly pushing for RCS adoption which would add all these emotions sharing: https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Rogers_Google_RCS.gif https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Telenor_6P_GIF_0UHHQdI.gif https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/RCS_Android_Update.width-600.png Adrien Aubel Exactly, but how relevant is Giphy? Again don't compare with things you've seen so far but with what it could potentially be if it truly understood your relationships and intentions, if it combined that with your taste and the way you usually communicate with this specific person. And what if your friends or other people were able to add their own media and stickers through channels and then be discovered, liked and followed, with deep intelligence powering it all and bringing the right content to the right user? We built invi to support all this, we don't just use a Giphy API, we used the most advanced and lightweight technologies to communicate in realtime with our backend, even on pretty bad 3G, from where we curate the media that eventually gets recommended to you. The screenshots you attached look great as well, but see Android Messages is a good example there's only 5 packs of stickers that won't get more relevant or smarter no matter how many stickers you use or how many times you use Android Messages. Idk who would use a given sticker hundreds of times, but anyway I'm not sure those were really representative of how Android Messages is most commonly used. The features are technically there, as often, but they're very limited in their potential as of now. The Awesome Bar isn't for everyone but can eventually help people like you, as images just get displayed while you're typing, no action required, and if you see one that you like you can just tap it to see how it looks and enrich your message, send and you're done. Google is pushing RCS, very true! And we're excited about the great work the Jibe team did in the past couple years. They're a bit shy to share their RCS client implementation at the moment, it may be unstable or not well documented at the moment, but we're meeting regularly with Google and hope to add RCS to our transparent switch as soon as possible, even though the user base is a bit limited at the moment it has the potential to grow fast and solve many issues. If they're reluctant for too long we may use other hubs that would communicate seamlessly through Unified Profile. But for now, we're watching the number of users actually benefiting from RCS grow while we focus on other areas of improvements. sam1331 I am actually kind of optimistic about all this, more so than I was maybe a year ago. They've been putting out a steady stream or improvements to Allo, and when I've experimented with it with a friend it actually is an enjoyable experience. Releasing it without a web app is just shocking, but if that's added and it works well, I could totally see moving over to it from Hangouts, where I do the vast majority of my communicating. The other piece of the puzzle is Duo. If they can integrate a Duo button in Allo conversations (like it seems they will), and they eventually add group calling, which can't be that far off, then I think it will be a nice solution for myself and my family. And I've got quite a few friends that are all about Android instead of iOS, so I can see them switching to Allo from Hangouts. But not until there is a web app, because they aren't stupid. Chad Knasinski I would use Allo if they added SMS support and a desktop version like Hangouts had. Nick.Trite Same here. I have Fi so I'll continue to use Hangouts for SMS. I really love the fact that I can switch seamlessly from desktop to mobile and still be sending SMS. Until Allo does that, I won't consider moving. Chad Knasinski Ditto Sir_Brizz And multi-device support. Can't even use it or sync it on my LTE Tablet... Carson Saldanha So, basically Hangouts but revamped? We've come in full-circle. Sir_Brizz Sure. The problem is that every other chat platform has these features in 2016. Including Hangouts. Roy Me to, love it. mxwp unless they remove hangouts from gmail, people will still secretly be using "hangouts" all the time. in fact, the only way Allo will ever take off without SMS is if it replaces Hangouts (gtalk) on gmail and inbox. Chad Knasinski So correct me if I am wrong here but Google wants us to do this with our messages: SMS - Google Messenger Business SMS - Hangouts Messages - Allo Facebook - Messenger Video Chat - Duo Business Video Chat - Hangouts Video Really? Are you kidding me here? Timmy Turner You've got it right and if there's a joke, you'll being waiting a while for the punchline. disqus_em5YfkbWdk What Business SMS and how is 8t different from other SMS? Zsolt V What does Facebook have to do with anything you wrote? So you are corrected. SpadeX Are you new to tech world? Timmy Turner I recommend Textra to anyone looking for a new SMS app. Sleek, customizable and continually updated/supported. Adrien Aubel Textra is very nice, notably customization-wise as you said, you can go deep and fine-tune basically any UX element. And it's super fast and lightweight as well. I am working as well on a new SMS app that also provides IM similarly to iMessage on iPhone, and many other features, most of them upcoming though. Would you mind giving me a honest feedback when you have the time? It's called invi on the Play Store https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi Timmy Turner Sure thing. freshprince_87 That invi SMS app is an awesome app. Near flawless app. but I stop using it because I kept having problems with MMS messages and also it just like Allo in the sense where if you uninstall the app and reinstall it on the same phone all your instant messages are all gone including some of the regular SMS /MMS messages. You need to make the app save all your messages on to an account like a Google account in the cloud. So that no matter what device you use the instant messages will still be there. Adrien Aubel @freshprince_87:disqus Thank you for your feedback! MMS can be very tricky and every carrier has its own set of specificities, I'm sorry about that, it shows we're still young but obviously like you said, such a core functionality bug makes our whole effort worthless for you here. Do you mind sharing your carrier, device model, and Android version? Did you try using "Legacy MMS" in the app settings? About the IM sync, that's an issue we're definitely looking into, considering all potential security and privacy issues, notably as some countries like USA recycle pretty aggressively your phone numbers, and with the desire to bring a Web client in mind. Google should announce this summer APIs that will eventually help us regarding security, so stay tuned :) freshprince_87 Thanks. I didn't use the legacy MMS. I hope that you add the IM sync soon. I'm on a T-Mobile service using the Moto Z Play on Android Nougat 7.0 Adrien Aubel Ok thank you, if you don't mind I have other questions to dive into your problem :) What specifically was failing? MMS sending, receiving, or both? Did it show an error? Is it only on group MMS or all MMS? Whatever information you may have will be helpful. Our next release should bring MMS reliability improvements and notably Wifi texting when supported by the carrier (first MMS may send up to 60s to send as we're trying out routes but then all other Wifi MMS should send very fast). Tom Westrick https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5ecvBaqHBk MJ Thank God I use Project Fi otherwise this would suck big time for me. TJ Mills Thank God I have Google voice.... Dracono Love hangouts never used SMS. It also seems most negative reviews about it being slow was always tired to the SMS feature. I'm now curious with the removal of they'll us the opportunity to evolve or let it idle. mxwp it will evolve into a business app... but hopefully still available for consumers VAVAMk_2 Just give us SMS support in Allo for Christ's sake! Adrien Aubel SMS/MMS can be quite hard to deal with technically and Google didn't choose to go that way. It is possibly also due to the push they did to replace the default SMS app on many OEMs and carriers, strategically it's hard for them to push much of Google's agenda through the SMS app they give carriers, and they're mostly limited to SMS/RCS. Roy Christ will not give you SMS, bat Star of David could promise you RCS in Allo. mxwp Big G repeatedly stated it would never happen tim242 Liar. Adrien Aubel https://twitter.com/amitfulay/status/840236304130428928 Roy Great. It's was the plan all along. Now Allow will get RCS and web browser everything gonna integrate with Duo. I'm all the way in. I never like Hangout. I love Allo. #stop stop babies don't you cry. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I don't think that's possible. RCS is still mainly just an extension of SMS. If it doesn't support SMS, I don't see it handling RCS. Roy When RCS will come it will be with SMS already. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Based on what? Besnik Rrustemi No problem guys,we have like 69 other Messaging Apps by Google to choose from and maybe 2 new others coming soon. Roy Haha it's so old. Can someone can come with new jokes here? Besnik Rrustemi Well sorry Old Man then, never knew your age before. * Respect for Old People * Sir_Brizz Let the confusion officially begin! Indianajonze google can go fk themselves Robert Gerhart Why isn't anybody asking the bigger question: why the hell does anyone use outdated SMS in the first place? It's like complaining that Hangouts doesn't integrate butter churns and wagon wheels either. There is nothing more annoying than a text message. Adrien Aubel SMS is always nice to have in some situations, that happen more or less depending on where you live. Uncovered areas, concerts or big games, people having no LTE-enabled plans, or simply on some roads and highways. In USA for example all those scenarios happen a lot, notably in some states. And eventually, in most countries you still use SMS for 3rd party services, banks, transportation, or even government-related messages. Most importantly, in countries that still use SMS you can reach *anybody you know* from one app. And that's really a great thing to have. Now you're right, IM is so much more pleasant. Instant delivery, read status, last active time, way faster image format and transport. At invi ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi ) we try to take advantage of this and combine both the way it should be. When you open a chat with somebody, we trigger a handshake to check that both you and the recipient are well connected. If one of both doesn't answer on time, it simply switches to SMS/MMS, it's automatic and out of your way. Otherwise you take advantage of state-of-the-art transport with some unique optimizations. Try to send a GIF over IM and see how fast it goes, compared to MMS or even Whatsapp. Let me know what you think! Aaron Simple; SMS is ubiquitous. Every cellular device in operation can send and receive SMS, from the most current and expensive flagships like the iPhone and Galaxy, to the cheapest budget devices, all the way down to the oldest flip phones. I can text my dad on his flip, my wife on her Nexus or my Capt on his iPhone and each one will receive that message and reply. Show me an IM that can do all of that (that isn't on the iPhone). I guess that invi app that guy's been pedaling might, but I'm waiting for it to gain some traction before trying to convince anybody to switch to yet another IM. Rod The rest of the world uses Whatsapp, everyone has it installed. JG Even people with generic flip phones? Rod Nope, but I don't remember the last time I saw someone with a flip phone. The poor now bear Galaxy Win/Pocket/etc JG My aunt still has one. She recently attempted to upgrade to a smartphone but that seems to have failed big time... Apparently my telling her to tap the icon that's labeled "EMAIL" to get her email is too complicated... That and the free phone she got is a PoS... 512MB of RAM and only 4GB of storage - with the OS consuming all but like 100MB there of. So it didn't perform quite so hot. She seemed a bit surprised her free phone didn't perform as well as my Pixel XL does... TJ Mills Everyone in China uses Wi chat. Rod USA is a world apart. lomsha Believe it or not, even 2g is still a luxury in some countries, which makes​ instant messaging iffy. In those cases sms is a great alternative. Not everyone is in the 1st world with a sweet smartphone and reliable data access. TJ Mills Standard is better than better. When someone comes up with a universal replacement that works on all classes of phones, then the world can switch. Until then it's a mishmash of services and applications​to communicate. Why does everyone still use email? Because of the standards. Michael Sørensen Convince me why I shouldn't... Currently I can write to anyone for free without first asking them what their preferred platform is. And they can reply for free regardless of said preferred platform. Again, convince me why that's not good enough? And don't say "stickers". Just don't. Security? Bah, no sensitive information sent. Midnitte At this point, I'm held hostage stuck using Hangouts since it's the only thing that natively supports desktop messaging. Sigh. Lord Argyris "Each has its disadvantages, though. The latter doesn't have quite the same feature set that Hangouts did, and the former is a Facebook product." It's lines like these that keep.me coming back to AP. JD My support for Google and their messaging platforms ended the beginning of May. Kelly Clubb Well this sucks for any user that enjoyed an easy to use sms app. I use Hangouts and thankfully for project fi will continue it's support BossMa1n3 Eh..doesn't effect me stop using hangout for sms awhile ago..more interested in a flat screen phone with side bezels as thin as the one in the pic.. Grey PLEASE Bring Hangouts Chat and Hangouts Meet to all users. That has so many new and awesome features. It's like everything Allo isn't. DragoCubed The comment section is rough b_boogey_xl Bye Hangouts! hp-fourtwenty oh ffs...voice is still supported??? hell yeah!! nxtiak I'm waiting for the day G+ contacts disappear from Hangouts. I hate how on PC when I type a name to start a conversation it lists random people on G+. SHOW ME THE NAMES FROM MY DAMN CONTACTS GOOGLE!!!!!!!!! Maave RIP Hangouts. I had group chats, Google Voice, and SMS all in one. Now my group chats have moved to Telegram but I'm still stuck with nerfed Hangouts for GV.

The reason turns out to be that the software fails to treat its secrets with suitable discretion. "Rclone has been banned for having the encrypted secrets in the source code," explained Nick Craig-Wood, primary author of the rclone software, in a post on Saturday. The application's OAuth2 API key, in encrypted form, is included in the rclone source code. It's common for developers inadvertently to include secrets such as API keys and login credentials, unencrypted, in code posted to public repositories. But this isn't quite the same thing. Craig-Wood, in a phone interview with The Register, explained that when you make an application that works with Amazon Drive, AWS makes you go through a process of verifying the app and then provide a key that identifies the app. This key is distinct from credentials used to identify individual AWS accounts that get billed for Drive usage. The way AWS deals with third-party Drive apps differs from the way Google does it, Craig-Wood explained. "I think Google has a better approach in that Google lets anyone make their own apps keys and if they ban someone, they ban the user rather than the app." Previously, anyone could take the rclone software, call it something else and submit the renamed application to AWS for a different OAuth2 key, but that's no longer possible because AWS has stopped granting developers access to the Drive API. The software's non-compliance with AWS rules came up in an Amazon Developer Forums thread dating back to October, 2015. "If the client secret goes to open source code that means it becomes public and theoretically anyone can use the same client ID/secret to impersonate this client," an Amazon moderator identified as Ross said in January, 2016. "This is completely in violation to the consent provided by the customer that their information can only be accessed by a particular third party." Craig-Wood, who was aware of Amazon's concerns at the time, said it was unclear why Amazon had decided to ban rclone now, but acknowledged that Amazon may be concerned about the potential for other apps to represent themselves as rclone using rclone's key. He speculated that Amazon may have started paying more attention to client software after there were security issues with an authentication server for acd_cli, another Amazon Cloud Drive client app that has also been banned. Craig-Wood said hundreds or possibly thousands of people who use rclone have been affected. Because the software is open source, there's no record of the number of users. But he said the more than 6,000 stars on the software's GitHub repository offers some indication of its popularity. Presently, he is waiting to hear from Amazon about getting new credentials so he can build an authentication server that keeps the app's OAuth2 key secret. He had hoped to avoid maintaining such a server because he will have to secure it to safeguard all the individual credentials that pass through the server. Amazon launched its Drive API in November, 2014, back when the service was called Cloud Drive. About two weeks ago, it stopped admitting new developers. There's speculation that Amazon may be having second thoughts about promising unlimited storage for $5 per month. Where Amazon Drive's web interface might place practical limits on high-volume usage, programmatic access to the service makes it cheaper than S3, Amazon's professional storage service, albeit without any service level or availability guarantees. Various discussions of the rclone ban on Reddit and Hacker News suggest some of those using rclone were uploading vast amounts of data to take advantage of Amazon's absurd commitment to infinite data warehousing. And it's possible some of that material may include unlawfully copied or illegal content. An advisory against building Amazon Drive apps that perform client-side encryption can be read as Amazon's attempt to avoid dealing with the headache of law enforcement demands to unlock data without the necessary keys. Amazon did not respond to a request for comment. ® Tips and corrections 3 Comments MORE Amazon Storage Aws Developer Sign up to our Newsletter Get IT in your inbox daily Subscribe More from The Register Amazon is to install its R&D brainboxes in Cambridge 400 folk will be moving in sometime in autumn 16 Comments Amazon web wind services BezosBux: Amazon gets into scrip game with Cash scheme Payment system lets punters use quaint concept of 'paper money' 19 Comments Amazon looks between the couch cushions for US$70m for kids' in-app spending spree refunds Lawyers stand down, bosses get checkbooks out 11 Comments Amazon relinquishes data from Echo that could have dropped eaves on a killing Murder accused consents to device being examined 14 Comments Amazon announces new Echo just as Microsoft's first Cortana-powered clone breaks cover It's a fat iPad with no battery 36 Comments Whitepapers Secure Mobile Development Best Practices Covering the vulnerabilities hackers might use to launch an attack, and remediation tips that you can use to build security into your app. Blending Cloud-native and Conventional Applications This IDC InfoBrief, sponsored by Red Hat, reviews ten lessons from early adopters for successful integration of cloud native and traditional applications.

You won't get quite the same level of functionality, unfortunately, but it means you're not stuck with one phone platform. This is all part of a wider push by Google (and indeed Apple) to make smartwatches more independent and less reliant on a connected phone. More functions happening on your  wrist device means the make of your handset isn't so important. Here's how it works. Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 153.99 +0.93 +0.61% Setting up Android Wear © Provided by Future Publishing Ltd. The setup process is actually very similar whether you're connecting Android Wear to an Android phone or an iPhone. We're doing the latter here, so you need the free Android Wear app Google makes for iOS, and of course a smartwatch running Android Wear 2.0. If the watch was previously connected to another device, reset it from the Settings menu. It's then just a case of following instructions: on the watch, choose your language, then fire up the app on your iPhone. All being well, you should see your watch listed, and you can just tap once to set up the connection (though you might get prompted to switch Bluetooth on your phone first). At that point the Android Wear app checks for any updates that might be available for your smartwatch, and once that's out of the way, you're asked to link a Google account to your watch - which is easy enough to do if you already have some Google apps on your iPhone. Android Wear basics © Provided by Future Publishing Ltd. With the setup out of the way, you're ready to start enjoying the new Android-iOS relationship you've just set up. From the main app you can access watch settings (the current faces and so on), and at first you'll see a prompt to turn on your feed - this basically gives Google permission to show you more personalized information on your wrist (such as flight information pulled from Gmail). The app also prompts you to share your location with the Android Wear app, and again the aim is to provide a more personalised experience, so you can get travel times to work, recommendations about nearby restaurants, and so on. The layout of the app is pretty straightforward. Tap on any watch face to set it, or on the cog icon at the top to get at more settings, like whether the always-on display and the tilt-to-wake feature are enabled or disabled. Load Error Functions on your watch © Provided by Future Publishing Ltd. As we've said, Android Wear 2.0 puts much more functionality on the watch itself: tap the power button to see your apps (or hold it for Google Assistant), swipe down from the watch face to see quick settings, or tap and hold the face to customise it. Head to Settings, then Connectivity, then Wi-Fi on the watch to add a wireless connection (don't worry, you can type in the password on your iPhone). This then allows you to install apps - in Android Wear 2.0 this is done from the watch itself, so open up the Play Store app on your wrist and see what you can find. You can also send Google Play apps to your watch from the web, to save you tapping out app names on the little screen. Android Wear 2.0 supports complications, so you can change the little information widgets shown on most faces - to do this, tap and hold on the watch face, then tap the cog icon. Some watch faces have more options than others - to change the watch face from the smartwatch itself, swipe right to see a selection. The differences with iOS © Provided by Future Publishing Ltd. Android Wear 2.0 watches work fine with iOS, but there are some limitations compared to an Android-to-Android connection. While you will get pings for text messages, for example, you can't reply to them from your wrist like you can with Android. Phone calls are restricted too - you can accept or refuse incoming iPhone calls from your wrist, but you have to actually take the call on your iPhone. For a lot of non-Google iOS apps, you have to make do with getting alerts, with very few actual interactions actually available on Android Wear most of the time. Music apps are one exception: Apple Music, Spotify, and Google Play Music can all be controlled from your wrist, so there's some interactivity there. You can even cache files on your wrist, though that's only available with Google Play Music. Gmail also lets you reply straight from your smartwatch though, and another tweak you can make is to show Google Calendar events on your wrist rather than ones from your Apple Calendar app - open the watch settings in the Android Wear app to do this. With standalone app support and decent links to iOS, Android Wear support for iPhones is better than ever: in fact it's getting close to being as good as it is for Android itself, though we're not there yet.

Because of this, people have started calling Google dull. Do you think that this year’s Google I/O developer conference was boring? UAG Samsung Galaxy S8 Cases As with any discussion, there are always differing viewpoints. Let’s start with the general consumer looking at I/O. Years ago, it was a fight to get into the developer conference because Google typically either unveiled new hardware or gave out gifts to attendees. These days though, Google might give away something small but other than the day 1 keynote, there is not much talked about that would interest non-coders. On the other hand, Google I/O is a developer conference, so it makes sense that everything discussed there would be coding or programming related in some form. This year, Google announced a bunch of new tools and APIs to help devs start building both Assistant and AI into their apps. For outsiders, this isn’t that entertaining, but for developers, it opens the door by giving them the ability to grow and improve their applications. So, did you think Google I/O this year was boring? Was it any better than the last couple of I/Os? Answer the poll below and let us know your thoughts in the comments!

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google adds new features to Play Store app subscription models By Rei Padla - May 22, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Google is determined to do some cleanup on the Play Store. Developers need not worry if they want their apps or games remain in the Android ecoystem. Just make sure you’re apps follow Google’s standards and pass the metrics provided. For those devs serious with their app development game, know that you can standout by fixing your code. If you’re already confident with your work, you can make your creation better by planning strategies and aggressively marketing them. If you’re a genius, you can make more money by offering in-app items or subscriptions. The latter is one reliable way to get more regular revenue. Your Android app listed on the Google Play Store can make you a lot of money. We don’t need to tell you what apps made millions but there are a lot of those developers who quickly made it big. If you think that is far from happening, don’t fret because the tech giant is offering devs subscriptions on Google Play. This model will benefit both developers and mobile consumers because they are presented with quality users and quality content. With subscriptions, some apps have seen up to ten times growth in consumer spending the past three years. Most apps have even seen double the number of subscribers. Some of you may not notice it but there is relevant growth in the app development arena. It’s not only because there are now 2 billion global monthly active Android users. Google is doing its part in reviewing the quality of apps. On the business side, adding even a small amount of premium to a simple app, game, or in-app item matters when we’re discussing volume. You can choose to grow your app subscription business. It can thrive on the Play Store once you start offering free trials, introductory pricing, or flexible billing periods. Paying for subscriptions with Google Play credit is also possible now and the move actually increase subscription spending by 15%. To further improve the system, Google is announcing account hold so a user will be blocked access if a payment fails. This way, subscribers will be given another chance whether to renew subscription or not. On the Play Console, you can now see a subscriptions dashboard. It’s a new feature together with a new report on app subscribers. As with any other businesses, this dashboard makes data more accessible to common users. In this case, developers like you can easily monitor data on the number of new subscribers, total subscribers, and cancellations. You can check your revenue data and insights on how you can make decisions relevant to the business and how to market subscription products. Subsription apps on Google Play is successful and according to a recent study by Google, free trials will help in acquiring users. About 78% of those 2,000 Android app subscribers surveyed said they usually start with a free app. Offering premium to some content makes users attracted to a game as it becomes more appealing than ever. Some of them continue with the subscription because of a discount offer while others already reached end of trial or they just want to remove the ads. No doubt, developers can make a lot of money from app subscriptions. It’s up to you as an app creator on how you will price or offer the app from a free app and convince Android consumers to pay for your content.

How Google plans to tackle power consumption even more aggressively in Android Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 5:29pm PDTMay 18, 2017 15 Plus 1 on G+ 99 Share on Facebook 58 Share on Twitter Total Shares172 Android OS Development Google News Videos Yesterday at I/O Google had an interesting talk called Background Check and Other Insights into the Android Operating System Framework. It's a long name, but really it's about improving battery life in Android. It went on at great length as to how, exactly, they plan on doing that, and it's quite worth a watch. We have the video here, but if you don't have the half-hour to check it out, then you are welcome to read below. The central methodology Google is using to try to improve things is the idea of visibility. When something is running in the background and doing a ton of stuff like calling your location at quick intervals, it results in battery drain. So now Google wants to change how things happen in the background, by ensuring that free-running background services aren't sucking your battery dry. Background apps will be pushed out of memory when they leave the foreground, and requests for things like location or WiFi happening in the background will only occasionally see new information from Android. Applications that would otherwise receive broadcasts also might not wake up unless they are given an explicit call to do so in the broadcast, although there are some exceptions. Apps can still get around this by being foregrounded in some way, but now that will be something visible that the user is aware of. This focus on visibility for apps will also mean developers will have to make decisions about what is really better to the user. If doing an ongoing notification as a means of bypassing the stuff above would confuse a user, is that really the right thing for them to do in that case? Other tools can be used to schedule your tasks ahead of time or to wait for events like the job intent service that developers can use in both pre and post-O environments. Jobs and alarms also allow the OS to defer. So, if something happens that would trigger a bunch of other apps to wake up, like a new picture being taken, that can be passed to those apps one at a time after a delay. That way the user doesn't suddenly have a ton of performance issues and drain out of nowhere. Basically, Google wants to solve some of the problems with battery life by defining bad behaviors for developers, like persistent background services or accidental leaks to the background of typically foregrounded activities, and make it clear that things have to be done the right way going forward or their stuff won't work. But it's also giving them new tools and choices for how to best accomplish the things they need to do. The new features in the Play Console and in Android Studio should also help developers be aware of when they are making these mistakes so that they can be fixed. It's a matter of visibility for the developers as well as visibility for the users. To paraphrase Steve Balmer: Visibility, visibility, visibility. A significant user-facing change of this visibility mindset is a new battery menu in O, with a focus on actionable interaction. Instead of just seeing stuff like Screen and Google Play Services next to a number that they won't understand, now users will be given ways of interacting with that data if they don't like it, and can better see how they are using applications without needing to do a bunch of mental calculations. So, when a user has a problem with their expectations of battery performance and goes looking to see what might be causing it, they are more likely to find what caused it, understand what it means, and take action about it. All of these changes are is in pursuit of Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life. Right now the tools in software aren't all there, but these are steps that can take us in that direction.

Good feature to take from iOS Knowledgeborn Allah This does seem similar to what Apple implemented in iOS, but I'm curious about how this will impact RAM management. If it reduces the cache file too much, it'll just close the application completely, and you'll have to start over every time you want to use the app again. Apple somehow found a way around this problem, even in devices with less RAM, but I'm not too sure how Google will accomplish this. Even "doze" on my Pixel XL kills apps in the background all the time. This new thing sounds it could potentially make the problem worse. Justin Osborne Well I sure can tell a difference since upgrading, that's for sure. The new battery section makes me feel a lot better about how the battery is looking. But that's where it ends. Today, I got a full hour less out of my battery than normal. 2 hours vs 3-3.5 on the Pixel. That said, it's a beta, so I'm not complaining. It's definitely not the direction I want to go tho (nor are these new emoticons, sigh). marcusmarcus2 "Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life." I'm glad, but can we get a two pronged attack to address this. Yes, Google needs to keep improving the software side, but OEMs need to help out and quit making thinner phones. They are thin enough, give us more battery capacity. AbdulB1 actually they save quite a lot by putting small batteries in the phones instead of big ones. Krzysztof Jozwik I'm not sure you read OP's comment. Nothing was said about saving... AbdulB1 smaller capacity battery is much cheaper marcusmarcus2 My original comment was not about savings, cheapness, cost, etc. Jack Jennings You've said the same thing twice for no reason. Krzysztof Jozwik I wouldn't say "much" I'm no expert on the matter, but last I checked replacement batteries aren't that expensive, and I don't have the buying power of an oem AbdulB1 Most phones today dont have replacement batteries, they have unremovable ones. OEM or no OEM a 3000mAh battery will always be cheaper than 4000mAh one. marcusmarcus2 I can find batteries for my different Moto G phones that have "Non-User replaceable batteries" for nearly the same price as my LG phones that have user replaceable batteries online. Most likely the OEMs can get them for about the same as well so replaceable or not really does not matter. Either way, yes a 3000mAh battery will be cheaper than a 4000mAh one for OEMs, but probably not much at all, especially at the volume they would by at. I'm guessing they are choosing smaller batteries to make their phones thinner and not because it is slightly cheaper for them. Thinness is better to advertise to most consumers as most consumers are drawn to looks over functionality now a days. I still prefer function over looks for my devices. Krzysztof Jozwik And non replaceable will always be cheaper than replaceable. The point is, the batteries aren't the bulk of the cost. Geoff Johnson What the hell is your point? He never said anything about cost, he was just talking about stop making phones thinner for design and aesthetic reasons. james fuston The idea that smaller and thinner phones result in less battery life is a bit of a misnomer. For an example, I'd refer you to the iPhone SE. marcusmarcus2 I never said smaller and thinner. I just said thinner. They could make some of the phones the same height and width as the current one but make it a little thicker to give a thicker battery, and that would help with the battery life. james fuston Okay, but your general sentiment is still that battery life is tied directly to physical size which, again stating my example of the iPhone SE, isn't the case. The power draw of the components is far more important than the physical size of the phone. marcusmarcus2 My general sentiment is ONLY in regards to thickness of the phone. My sentiment is not to width or height, which also make up the size of the phone. The width and height is usually determined more by the screen where thickness is more often do to battery. A larger screen (component) will draw more power than a smaller screen, I agree with you there. But you seem to think the size of the battery does not make a difference, please correct me if I am wrong. Using your example of iPhone SE, if they would have made that a little thicker than it is now by making the battery larger, that would have made the battery life even longer than it already is. That is my point. james fuston > A larger screen (component) will draw more power than a smaller screen, I agree with you there. Let me give this one more shot. "your general sentiment is still that battery life is tied directly to physical size which, again stating my example of the iPhone SE, isn't the case" To break out the pieces, battery life is tied...to physical size...which, again...isn't the case. In other words, we do not agree. The iPhone SE is the exact same size as the iPhone 5S and it gets 30%+ better battery life purely through efficiency in components. To say high mAh results in long battery life is a misnomer that the G6 or V20 should be a clear reminder of. You also cannot equate physical size to battery capacity as energy density is not a universal measurement. marcusmarcus2 You are comparing different phones with different components. I agree with you that component efficiency has an effect on battery life. But... Let me give you one more shot. We will use your iPhone SE for this. If there were 2 versions of the SE. Both have the exact same components except one has a battery that is 1000 mAh larger than the other (thus making it slightly thicker), than the one with the larger battery would have more battery life, Thus the thicker one would have better battery life. That is what I am saying. I'm not comparing large phones to small phones. I'm saying if they had a larger battery in a phone with the exact same specs/components then the battery life would be better. That is all my point was. Do you not agree with that? EDIT: Yes, size of the battery may not increase with capacity due to density, but it usually will increase in size as it does increase in capacity, especially if it increases a lot. Geoff Johnson Again, you're talking about it being smaller. The iPhone SE gets good battery life because it has a 4" screen. The complaint is that phones are getting THINNER. Meaning that they still have 5.5-6" displays, but are thinner and translate to smaller batteries. james fuston Nope, not at all. The cell in the SE is about 50mAh bigger than the 5S (which is the exact same size). The 30%+ battery life improvement comes from more efficient components, not just their size. marcusmarcus2 Technically it is 2 dimensional train of thought. Also, if they increased it horizontally or vertically, then they would most likely have to increase the dimensions of the phone horizontally or vertically, thus changing the size of the screen or bezel. Increasing it thickness wise means they would not have to change the look of the of the front of the phone. Anywho, I'm only talking about thickness, not height, width, different components, different phones, not small phones or big phones. I'm talking just battery capacity, if all other components remain the same. Thickening the battery would add battery capacity without changing the over all look much at all. It could be any phone of your choosing. If adding a thicker/higher capacity battery to whatever 1 phone you want, that phone would have a longer battery life. Do you not agree with that logic? james fuston Thickness is commonly referred to as "depth" otherwise known as the Z-axis. That's one dimension. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8cba520372d511803190227fe949a5d698a79509804cb6ec7f8f2afbe25323c3.gif marcusmarcus2 you are right, that is 1 dimensional thinking. I read it wrong. And you are right I miss the joke as I do not see what is funny. I'm glad you know that thickness is depth, but when referring to phones, depth is commonly referred to as thickness. Anyways, You are the one that is applying 3 dimensional thinking when my general sentiment was only referring to 1 dimension, thus you pretty much accused me of referring it to all dimensions, when I was not. Now you are complaining I'm only applying it to 1 dimension. Which is it? https://68.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmbq2nuTrp1qcr8tuo1_500.gif In all seriousness though. I AM only referring to 1 dimension, thickness or depth (whichever you want to go by). Then they can fit a thicker battery in to increase its capacity without having to get a higher cost denser battery and without changing the over all look of the phone. Compare that to getting a battery that is larger in height and/or width, that phone would need to be designed with either a larger bezel (which would most likely make the phone look bad) or use a larger screen (which would most likely be less power efficient which would negate some of the extra battery capacity). james fuston > you are right I miss the joke as I do not see what is funny. Missing the joke and not seeing the joke as funny are two different things, but the joke wasn't really meant for you either way. > I'm glad you know that thickness is depth, but when referring to phones, depth is commonly referred to as thickness Yes, this is referred to as a "synonym" in the English language. > You are the one that is applying 3 dimensional thinking when my general sentiment was only referring to 1 dimension, thus you pretty much accused me of referring it to all dimensions I'm not sure you understand how to use "thus." To recap; you said the way to make battery life longer was to make phones thicker. I said you shouldn't conflate (that means mistakenly associate) thickness with battery life, as the physical size of a battery can also be increased with an adjustment in width or height of a phone. Not sure how you got me "[accusing you] of referring it to all dimensions" out of that. I can tell now that your argument originates from the fact that you don't like bezels and aren't crazy about large screens, but also want longer battery life. The reality here is that the majority of people disagree with you and would care significantly if their next phone was substantially thicker than their current phone, largely due to the fact that increased thickness makes curved-edged or "bezel less" phones significantly harder to hold. marcusmarcus2 >Yes, this is referred to as a "synonym" in the English language. Yes, we both agree on the fact it means the same. I just wasn't sure why you pointed out it is the same as depth when that seems to have been obvious to both of us. Maybe I did not use 'thus' correctly, but I'm sure you know what I meant and just don't want to address it. >To recap; you said the way to make battery life longer was to make phones thicker. I said you shouldn't conflate (that means mistakenly associate) thickness with battery life, as the physical size of a battery can also be increased with an adjustment in width or height of a phone. Not sure how you got me "[accusing you] of referring it to all dimensions" out of that. How do you not get you, you just repeated it? I was only referring to 1 dimension and you are trying to apply more dimensions to, which would change the over all look of the phone which would make people that like that phone not want that phone any more, whatever the phone was to begin with. Also, your recap is incorrect. I just said phones should be thicker for better battery life, meaning the thickness should come because of a thicker battery. Your response was address "smaller AND thinner phones" meaning you were applying other dimensions to the thickness which would make it a different phone with most likely different parts. >I can tell now that your argument originates from the fact that you don't like bezels and aren't crazy about large screens Half right and half wrong. I don't like bezels. I do like large screens though. I'm not referring to big phones or small phones. I'm refering to and phone compared to itself but thicker. You are the one comparing different size (width and height) phones. My point is you don't have to change the look of whatever phone you like if you just increase the thickness, whether that phone is large or small. >The reality here is that the majority of people disagree with you You sure about that? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/013a3bd18bb4ffc1eba1ece1d07e1fe9b6aeb2639380ca6c9fe00b40e043e452.png When a company releases 2 choices of the same phone with only the thickness/battery being different (same screen size, storage, RAM, processor, etc.) then we can see if people really do feel about thickness over battery life) Sk0ly You can't compare between OSs. There is a reason Android uses more battery, it features true multitasking and doesn't drastically limit background processes like iOS. Looks like Google is going a bit to the Apple approach going forward as devs can't be counted on to write decent code. james fuston Seeing as we're talking about physical dimensions and hardware specifications and they're effect on power draw, you absolutely can compare between operating systems. Processors aren't suddenly able to use more power than they're designed to use just because you've installed a different operating system. Jason B "Processors aren't suddenly able to use more power than they're designed to use just because you've installed a different operating system." Just to jump in: sure, they won't use more than their design power, but they can be used very inefficiently depending on OS. All modern mobile SoCs have hardware clock and power gating, but if software isn't allowing the SoC to idle properly or needs to use more CPU/GPU cycles to complete tasks versus other OS, yes, you will use more power as the clocks+voltage jump around instead of going into SoC's proper sleep mode for former or will hold onto higher clocks longer for latter. Apple makes both its hardware and software, so if you think that has no net effect, well ... Sk0ly Except the OS's operate in a completely different manner. Androids advantage being background functionality and iOS advantage being battery life. marcusmarcus2 What's this "We" stuff? You are talking about physical dimensionS and hardware specificationS. I'm talking about A physical dimension and the only hardware specification I'm talking about is the capacity of the battery resulting from it being thicker. You don't like @Sk0ly:disqus comparing different OS's when OS's have nothing to do with the point you are making? That's funny because you are doing the same thing to me, comparing different size (height and width) phones with different specs when that has nothing to do with the point I am making. marcusmarcus2 To be fair, @j_fuze:disqus was not comparing between OSs. He was comparing between different iOS devices. Specifically iPhone SE and iPhone 5S. You have to read a few of his comments to see what he was comparing. Either way, he missed my point by comparing different phones with different specs. My point was if ALL things being the same between 2 phones, except one had a thicker/larger capacity battery, that would give that thicker phone more battery life. I'm not sure why James is so hell bent on comparing different size phones with different specs/components. james fuston > James is so hell bent on comparing different size phones with different specs/components. lol, because I'm not interested in comparing different colors of the same phone? I didn't realize we were comparing battery life of hypothetical devices. marcusmarcus2 Colors? What are talking about now? Seriously, focus. >I didn't realize we were comparing battery life of hypothetical devices. I'm glad you started to finally read then and figured it out. Unfortunately, they will stay hypothetical until companies come out with devices with bigger batteries. james fuston Yes, colors. What other difference could there possibly be if the dimensions and specs of the phone are the same? You're 0/3 on understanding a point presented by someone else now. marcusmarcus2 >You're 0/3 on understanding a point presented by someone else now. haha. Lets address this part first because it is too funny. Not only can you not focus, you are delusional. You are the one who cannot get a point and you try to say I don't get a point. You are hilarious. I'm the OP of this thread of comments, you replied to me initially and you failed to understand the point. You have since replied numerous other times and have failed again and again to understand the point, each time bringing up different aspects of a phone that had nothing to do with my initial point. I get your points, but they have nothing to do with what my point is initially. Just because you can't understand that does not mean I don't get your point. >Yes, colors. What other difference could there possibly be if the dimensions and specs of the phone are the same Hmm. This is a tough one. Maybe battery capacity and additional thickness dues to extra battery capacity, you know, like I have said since the bigining and in every other comment since then. No other dimension and spec other than those, like I said each time. Talk about not understanding a point, you are the king of missing the point. https://media.giphy.com/media/14r9VMLSuQUzQs/giphy.gif Lets try to make this easy for you. Try to answer the following. I'll give you a little help by giving you the answers seeing as you have trouble catching the point of this original comment thread. Would a larger capacity battery give a phone more battery life compared to a smaller capacity battery, considering that is the only difference? Yes. Would increasing the thickness of a battery give it more capacity, considering that is the only difference? Yes. Would a thicker battery result in a thicker phone, considering that is the only difference? Yes. Are there other ways of increasing battery life? (This was not part of my original point, but since you keep adding it then I'll address it) Of course, like more optimized software or more efficient parts. Would including a larger capacity battery along with optimizing the software and more efficient parts give more battery life than optimized software and more efficient parts alone? Of course they would. Do more efficient parts have anything to do with your point you are trying to make? No What about color? Again, nothing to do with my point. What about box the phone comes in? No, but I thought I'd through that in there as a guess what James might try and distract with next. Do you get my point yet? My point is a larger capacity battery through making battery and the phone thicker would make any phone have more battery life. I really hope you get the point this time as you seem to be the only one who can't comprehend this. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/013a3bd18bb4ffc1eba1ece1d07e1fe9b6aeb2639380ca6c9fe00b40e043e452.png james fuston > Of course, like more optimized software or more efficient parts. Hey look! After another 5 paragraphs he comes around to the same conclusion as the "delusional" guy. I'm looking forward to reading the next essay, keep em coming. Oh and keep posting screenshots of the up/downvotes you've enabled, it's highly entertaining. marcusmarcus2 Not picking out only parts of my response and ignoring what you don't want to address. I have not come to the same conclusion as you. Like I said I got your point about more efficient parts. But like I said, that has nothing to do with the point I was making. I won't explain it again, I've done so enough and if you don't get it by now, then you are either a special kind of stupid, smart but to suborn to admit your wrong, or a troll who successfully trolled me. I'm done reading your lack of intelligent responses. I'll let Bobby finish talking to you because I am done. http://pa1.narvii.com/5800/e40bec66da3b149914b3323a0a2d5e07bc96bce2_hq.gif https://m.popkey.co/765dfc/Re7oQ.gif JD The SE wasn't thinner. Ryne Hager Give me a OnePlus with 5000mAh and I would be so happy. someone755 Give me a 4.7" phone like the og Moto X and I would be so happy. Neither of us are going to be happy, Ryne. Drakenoid OG Moto X updated for current year would be perfect for me. Vlad I never broke a single headphone since I first had a smartphone in 2011 until I got a 5" phone. Since then, I need to buy new ones if I use one daily for more than 2 weeks, simply because sitting or walking up on stairs will break the cable thanks to the length of the phone. Upsides: 5" phone with 4100 mAh battery => amazing. And it's also thin as heck. Downsides: breaks headphones, bends, need to root for decent software (Xiaomi). Gimme back my 4.5" 720p screen, Motorola. Kristian Ivanov I highly agree on the thin phones part. Bought a Huawei P10 2 days ago, for me, that thing is unusable without a case to make it a bit fatter. Karly Johnston If they fix idle battery drain that doesn't become an issue. marcusmarcus2 I'm not saying they should not fix battery drain. I'm saying if they fix battery drain AND add higher capacity battery (making phone a little thicker), they could increase battery life even more than just addressing one of them. So if fixing the battery drain adds another day and a thicker battery adds another day, you'd go from 1 day to 3 days instead of just 2 days from only fixing battery drain. Karly Johnston The battery life the current 625 phones are getting is where flagships need to be. That should be enough for anyone. marcusmarcus2 Everyone is not all the same. It may be enough for you. I'm saying, phones are beyond thin enough and could be thicker to increase battery life even more beyond what a 625 phone can do. Now, this is my opinion in regards to how I would like to use a phone. You are welcome to your own opinion. I'm not going to say what should be enough for anyone other than me. Karly Johnston The OEMs don't think that is what the vast majority of people need or want. Their target is a full day of battery life which is what most people are worried about. It isn't my opinion, it is the industry opinion of what the marketing priorities are. X-47B My phone has 4000 mAh battery, and it's 5.5-inch display. I easily get 2 days of battery even after heavy usage. Margaritas Ante Porcos Installed O on my 6p and battery still drains like a whore in a bukkake twelvesome. Google really can't do nothing at this point. Android is breaking to pieces. So many things needed to be fixed in O but instead Android's got even worse. That notification empty desert area of white grey nothingness kills me the most. Hate it really bad. The last Android I liked was 6th. catalysto Not sure what you're talking about. Battery life on my 6P with the new O is great. Maybe you have an aging battery? Margaritas Ante Porcos as long as your 6p works great, nothing else matters, right? Roy That's right. catalysto Just saying. My anecdotal evidence is as good as yours. And having poor battery life across multiple OS versions is a pretty strong indicator for a bad battery, don't ya think? In fact, I had the same problem with a previous 6P. iFeign Complain some more about your beta software Margaritas Ante Porcos It started with 7.1.2. Do you really need to be a btch when bad things happen to others? Roy For me everything goes smooth on my 6P on 7.1.2. so I need to complain that Android to good. The Wrath of Kahn If your 6P has shut down even once before reaching about 5% then you most likely have one of the defective batteries. I had to have mine replaced, but after that, it runs all day like a charm. ODP2 improved it, if anything. Margaritas Ante Porcos it was fine for a long time until I updated to 7.1.2. That update screwed the battery that was working superb all the time. DANA Try to do a factory reset, it fixes many problem for some user. Margaritas Ante Porcos It was one of the first things I did. Twice. Did not help. Paul_Werner Yeah you got to call Google (if you got yours from the Play Store). They've been replacing 6Ps with factory refurbished ones even out of warranty (source: it happened to me) Matthew Skalecki The update didn't screw up your battery. The battery was going to crap out on you regardless of which Android version you had. This happened to many people including me. Replacing the battery fixes the issue; reverting to a previous os does nothing. Zach Mauch Did you go through Google or a local shop? The Wrath of Kahn Unfortunately it was out of warranty, had a friend with the skills do it for me. JD I need more of this colorful imagery to describe simple everyday problems. mchalakov First off you are using a beta OS don't complain. Second thing is that battery drain comes mostly from the (bad)apps - if you watched the video or read the article you could understand. Third - I'm pretty sure you can go back to Marshmallow if you are so so so unhappy with Nougat or O. Jakst Really? Yesterday was my first day with Android O. I plugged my phone out at 7, and come home at midnight with 35 % battery left. I've never had that kind of battery life in my 6P before. So I've seen huge gains with this O preview. thereasoner The Android O beta I'm using is so slow to charge my Pixel today that it seems like that's what they tackled​....and not in a good way. iFeign Surprise, surprise, you're running BETA software. Smh. thereasoner Yeah I know and I'm sure it will get fixed between now and September. I'm just saying that the current difference in charge time is quite noticable at this point. AbdulB1 maybe they removed quick charge support in beta mattcoz Pixel never had quick charge. AbdulB1 hmm interesting. I thought it has qualcomm processor so it must have qc 3.0 too. Must be some proprietary stuff or qualcomm must be asking for more money to enable it. mattcoz Google is pushing the open USB-C power delivery standard. AbdulB1 Display screen eats up most of my battery. I can't see what google is doing will fix it somehow. We need different types of screens now. iFeign Uhh, it's as if you expect things to use NO battery at all. Infinite battery life! Of course using the screen, aka, using the phone, is going to be the largest proportionate power drain - no matter how fancy the screen tech. AbdulB1 battery tech has still not improved and nor did the screen tech. I can accept that the screen tech will remain same for a long time but as far as batteries are concerned they can be improved , made for longer number of recharge cycles but that hasn't caught up with the manufacturers yet. One thing which can be done is increasing the battery capacity but we all know this is not happening as phone manufactures think it will make phones bulky , add weight and in long term affect the sale of newer devices. Latheryin Multi day battery life will not happen until new battery tech comes around. With people needlessly having screen on times of 5+ hours there is no way to keep a battery charged for extended periods. Krzysztof Jozwik I average 2 hours of screen on time a day. Just because some use their phone 24/7 doesn't mean we all do. I have a job where I'm not on my phone, at home I have better screens to get info from. The phone is there when I need it. Your nonstop use case is not the norm. Latheryin As do I but that is not the norm. Might want to look at any forum about battery life and looking at screen on times. Most want and use 5+ hours. It's mainly the older generation like us that doesn't need it and are not on the device all the time. Krzysztof Jozwik Obviously the forums about battery life have people winning that they want 48 hours of screen on. That is not the norm. Sure, lots of people want that, most do not. Latheryin Most want more screen on time. Why do you think battery life is such an issue. disqusdeeznuts My Moto Z Play begs to differ. Motorola does it right with this phone. It has a good size battery (3510), an efficient processor, and runs smooth. It can be done, but for some reason, it just isn't a focus for a majority of manufacturers. Latheryin Well sure all the devices with that mid range chip and battery combo can get ok battery life. I could easily. Get 2 days out of my device and it only has a 3200 battery. It is not the oem. It's people. They need to spend less time look at their phone and more time living life. Which many are unprepared for. Cakefish I'm going the leaked Moto X4 continues that legacy onwards! Rod Ever heard of the Moto z Play, or Lenovo P2? Latheryin As already stated on that. The moto has a mid tear chip. As for the Lenovo, nope. Can't say I have, it's either not sold in my country or a mid low tier device that I wouldn't have noticed. Just looked. They both use the same mid tier chip. Also that does have a good battery. But that like the K1000 with a 10000 battery are the exception and seldom are they flagship quality. WarpspeedScp The Moto z does not have an SD 820 on it. Neither does the P2. It's very annoying that manufacturers can't give us something functional instead of eye-candy for once. Rod While it's not top of line sillicon, real world testes have proven that, for everyday tasks, there's virtually no difference between the S625 ans 821 WarpspeedScp Well, my phone has an SD 650, and dolphin emulator just about keeps up (wind waker and super smash Bros). On an 820, there would definitely be better results. Paul Troy I have a better idea. Get the hardware manufacturers to put a bigger battery in their devices. 💡 Taedirk If we could convince hardware manufacturers to do something useful, we wouldn't be on yet another revision to how Android updates the OS. Alex Yeah so this way the horrible wakelocks (that Android makes almost impossible to manage) will be less visible. Cakefish Why not both? Zach Mauch All I want to know is can they stop wakelocks. JD Same bullshit every year. I'll believe it when I see it. Unless Android O somehow allows me to download more mAh. Morten Ulv Are you trying to say Android battery life hasn't improved VASTLY over the years? JD Yep in fact it's regressed Morten Ulv I have no such issues. Better battery all across the board. JD What ever you're smoking pass that shit around Morten Ulv Your shit must be stronger than mine. browngeek I miss the days of my Xperia Z3 Lollipop and Stamina mode. Used to get 48 hours and 5-6 hours SOT. D13H4RD2L1V3 I hope this actually does something when the final build is out. I'm getting tired of hearing of every new battery improvement in a new version of Android only to have a wakelock pretty much make all of that moot. Dennis Ulijn I am on the Android O beta, and i must say that the information i get from it it really useful! I never could find the wakelocks because i'm not rooted, but now i can easily see what apps use up battery in the background. Awake meditation app was in use for 15 minutes (meditation) and active in the background for 1 hour (basically, ever since the meditation)! "Restrict background usage" to on, and we'll see what it brings tomorrow. PI this is interesting .... :) ,, Whats the current update Dennis Ulijn I'm in Europe so I just woke up. I'll let you know end of the day. Dennis Ulijn k. End of the day here. The apps (pocketcasts and aware) behaved nicely now. at 23%, which is not that great with 2 hours of screen on time and 32% and 5%of the battery used up by system and services respectively. (apps 32%, system 32%, services 5%, Cell standby 3%, idle 2%, bluetooth and wifi 0%) PI System 32% ,,, ???? Dennis Ulijn Yeah, last weeks i had the bug where system was using a lot of battery... I don't care right now, because i'm not expecting good battery life while on a beta. I did find a fix for system battery usage on Reddit though, which is to reset app preferences (which mostly only resets permissions and things like default apps. PI When in fist saw it ,,I was like WTH 32% but then it's beta software ,,so we kinda expect it . Yes per app battery usage section with foreground and background Info is really great . But I suspect google play services and Android os battery section will not be effective that much unless they show wahts making them to suck up battery . Sabin Bajracharya Meanwhile Google's own apps will somehow be able to bypass this restriction :D Michael Sørensen Google's own location services, Now cards, Chrome, etc. eats the most battery for me - even worse with location history on. How about fixing that first...? WarpspeedScp Try Firefox! Also, turn location off as soon as you can. mlm5em But with O, you can now turn off Background activity on an app specific basis. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/eaaaef5de863733535628a24f5b0d44f888ae3ff0cb89d1c8cffc0680083c526.png mattcoz Good to see there's an option to turn it off. Morten Ulv Very handy! IncCo Anything that improves the battery life is awesome John Monks I have concerns about this. There are some apps I *want* running in the background, but I don't want them filling up the notification shade. One example, Lightflow has to have a pointless notification in order to do the job I installed it to do. I know it's there, any consequences for my battery life are mine to live with. It would be OK if I could toggle a setting to permit a particular app to run a 'free running background service' silently but this is Google so I expect I'll have to put up with spam instead (and no, collapsed notifications are still notifications), or there will be a toggle that does nothing, like the 'ignore optimisation' setting that currently exists. Drakenoid There apparently is, check comments above, there's a screenshot. David Onter You can disable all notifications from an app, which removes the permanent notification. Cakefish It's about damn time. All hail Android O. AdamH So does it mean my phone will be useless? something_new Apple was right then Đức Thành I'm beginning to get excited again, even knowing that actually achieving this would take many years. Fidelator Allow us, the end user, to have absolute control over which apps can run in the background under certain conditions, I have disabled notifications on Facebook and Instagram yet they still have multiple persistent RAM hogging battery sucking services 100% of the time smeddy My next phone won't get a look-in without a 4000mah+ battery in it. Since Samsung dropped the removable battery, battery anxiety has crept back into my life. abc Multi-day battery life? Ha! I solved this over a decade ago. The key to long battery life is having an actual life. Have friends and family and an active social life. Don't be the loser who keeps fiddling with his phone every few mins, when everyone already knows you don't get any important messages. You'll be amazed how long your battery lasts when you aren't pulling out to jerk off on it every few mins. And for god's sake, at home, a cell phone should be no different than a landline. If you're watching videos or playing games on your 5" inch screen, you need to invest in a PC or console. Sk0ly Good for Google. Some apps, particularly Facebook and Facebook messenger run ALWAYS in the background, even when you haven't used the applications in days. In my opinion, this is just lazy coding and is likely due to Facebook's data mining. In comparison, Hangouts and Allo only run on demand. Android has always allowed developers freedom to responsibly code their apps to allow them to do more. This is recognition that this freedom has been abused and now developers have to be treated more similarly to how they are on iOS.

SMS support for Hangouts officially ends today, excluding Google Voice and Project Fi subscribers Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/22 2:29pm PDTMay 22, 2017 64 Plus 1 on G+ 177 Share on Facebook 77 Share on Twitter Total Shares318 Applications Google News Videos Today is the day that Hangouts finally loses SMS support. We were warned by Google about it months ago when Hangouts started showing a warning that it would no longer support the feature. But, as of today, it's finally set to happen. For anyone that isn't on Project Fi or Google Voice — both of which will continue to support SMS in Hangouts — this is the end of an era. Many people, myself included, made the final push into Hangouts over other services when SMS support was added. The integrated conversations made it much easier to keep short communications together in one place. So far there's no word on if SMS support will be coming to Allo. Now that Hangouts support for SMS is finally over, we aren't really left with a clear migration method. Anyone that might have made use of it will have to either deal with using two separate apps again or move over to a new service. If you are looking for recommendations, Google's stock Android Messages isn't so bad. But, if you've been enjoying having SMS and chats merged, that isn't really a solution. Allo is always an option. But, that's the same issue from the other side, you'd still need to find a way to send SMS messages. There's always Facebook Messenger or Signal, which both provide a combined SMS and chat solution. Each has its disadvantages, though.  The latter doesn't have quite the same feature set that Hangouts did, and the former is a Facebook product. Either way, it's closing time. You might have just enough left to send one last SMS before the lights are shut off. If you still plan on using Hangouts for chats going forward, make sure you've updated to the latest version of over at Google Play or APKMirror. Download QR-Code Hangouts Developer: Google Inc.

Now I like Hangouts just as they EOL it! TechGuy22 LOL 4Ui812 Google hangouts ...

JVF When referring to people it is always "Hanged", sounds funny but that's just how it is. It's a past participle. Ryne Hager Yup, I know. That was the joke. 4Ui812 I understand what you're saying and I debated the proper way to put it..... I have to stand by hanged. instinct I am like 6 different active group chats in Hangouts. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Google doesn't care about you. humulos A truer statement has never been said Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2c9aad5a41d09ce24c4c4e04e7b3a28a2004487ff015df2fc519b5c2a9556024.gif Adrien Aubel Google's messaging strategy is now: - Android Messages for carriers & OEMs - meaning strictly SMS/RCS - Allo for their new consumer messaging service, and the focus of their upcoming work - Hangouts for business/enterprise Nothing personal :) humulos How innocent we once were, at the time when we witnessed Talk, Voice, SMS and G+ Messages become a single product, fulfilling all our dreams. Undone in naught but a few years, with this final limb being ripped from the body. But I guess I'm on Project Fi, so I'm good for now. My parents weren't happy about this news, since our family communicates primarily on large Hangouts threads. mxwp but if they are using actual Hangouts IM threads and not SMS they can still use Hangouts Adrien Aubel IMHO those big plans haven't been followed by strict coding/design rules, and Hangouts became progressively a technical mess, then a true nightmare for anybody to work on, with the UI becoming slower with each version, fortunately partly compensated by faster phones. To be fair, SMS/MMS can be very complicated to deal with, and Android development was much harder and potentially messy when Babel has been developed, the technologies available nowadays would have helped a lot. So down the road it would have been neither productive or future-proof to keep iterating all efforts inside Hangouts, at least without a total recode from the ground up. Right now I wonder if they will indeed clean the code up to remove all carrier SMS/MMS, and eventually speed up the app and make it smaller, or just roughly disable it. t_newt If Hangouts became a technical mess, the solution isn't to drop Hangouts, it's to fix Hangouts. They could have made it a framework for their products that any of their messengers could be installed into. Instead they are trying to make it an enterprise Slack competitor. What company is going to trust their company to Google's leftovers? "SMS/MMS can be very complicated to deal with". Apparently this is true at Google. Duder12 They aren't getting the left overs. They are getting two brand new products. Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat. My name is…. Nobody ever used Hangouts for SMS outside America. Actually, nobidy uses SMS no more. There DOES exist a world outside America, you know, and its much bigger!! sproc Haha, you wish. Everyone I know is stuck on sms. They try whatsapp and stuff then abandon it. Adrien Aubel Especially iOS users, who already have a great "Messages" app that outsmarts SMS when possible. For them it doesn't make too much sense to download another messaging app every now and then. Rodrigo Gomes da Silva So.. where are you from? Jay No you wish, but you must be in the states. No one i know uses SMS anymore. It's an archaic dead service, only used for bank transaction notifications and amazon deliveries. Everyone else is either on whatsapp (yes 220 million of us in this country and growing at 4 million a month) or (wechat which is like what 85-90 percent of China) No one cares for SMS. TheDrunkenClam What an unnecessarily smug and nagging comment. Winston Well it's true, even if it's smug. Outside the US, SMS is pretty much dead as we've all moved towards WhatsApp, as carriers still don't give unlimited texts by default. I think it's time to start asking another company for SMS integration. Christopher Gannon That would work if so many people in the US weren't using iMessage, where the only way a non-apple user can chat is via SMS. Then apple makes it very difficult NOT to use it, so good luck convincing your friends to give up siri, etc. I'd also like a solution, like hangouts or iMessage, where messages aren't restricted to a phone, and I can seamlessly use both on my laptop, tablet or phone. Ryan Yes, but we still have all of the money. Magister Good for them. I live in us and everyone uses sms, so that's what I use. What everyone else uses is moot. Michael Sørensen Nonsense. I'm not in the US (Europe) and the VAST majority in my country still use SMS. Jason Hirsch I was very annoyed at having to add Hangouts as my SMS client. I couldn't keep separate separate anymore. Now in combination with Fi, GV, 2 phones and obi it's a nightmare. On this overseas trip i couldn't force Fi to dial via WiFi. So i had to go back and install Hangouts dialer. If they (Google) have a master plan there's no rhyme or reason to it. atc-tech Google Voice users should still be able to use it too, I think? I don't know. I switched the the updated GV app when it came out around the same time the hangouts DEintegration was announced, so I'm not sure, but I think Voice users still can... Aaron Berlin Who knows what the plan is long-term for GVoice in Hangouts, but the actual GVoice app is actually good now. No equivalent to the chrome extension/desktop app, though. Ryne Hager You are right, Google Voice users can also continue to receive SMS messages in the app, I'll make that more clear. atc-tech Cool. I wasn't sure GV still could, but I thought I remembered hearing that we could. I gave up already though and use the prettier new GV app... Wish they would add back more features though. Ryne Hager The new app is so pretty. I do wish my GV voicemails would show up in my call logs again, though. mxwp i exclusively use my GVoice number for calls and texts and use it on Hangouts. the update GVoice app has an annoying bug in that it tries to connect every account on your phone instead of just your main one. i have submitted it as a bug but have not heard anything back Tom Harman So when does Allo officially get SMS support, lol. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Same time it gets tablet support: Never. rndusrnm479461 Am I the only one who doesn't understand what's so good about SMS integration in either Allo or Hangouts? Is it really hard for you people to use 2 apps? Jesus christ. Google's "Android Messages" is lightweight anyway, why is it such a problem to use it? It shouldn't even eat much RAM. Kyle Gospodnetich Yes, yes you are. Please never work for Google, or really any company that has a hand in communications. My name is…. No, he is not Kyle Gospodnetich Congrats, now there's two of you idiots. iluvthesoftsoft One do-it-all app > two apps Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi, https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi, we're trying to fix texting on Android and provide transparent switch between SMS&IM (devices handshake when you get into chats so that we determine whether you or the recipient has poor reception and should prefer SMS for example). MJ Two apps? One app for SMS and than Facebook, WhatsApp, Allo/Hangouts, and whatever to cover all my contacts. SMS is the only thing I can message 100% of my contacts with. Adrien Aubel Google's messaging strategy is now: - Android Messages for carriers & OEMs - meaning strictly SMS/RCS - Allo for their new consumer messaging service, and the focus of their upcoming work - Hangouts for business/enterprise They can't risk to upset carrier and OEMs by implementing non-carrier features in Android Messages / the default SMS app they provide. Or at least it's a risk they're not ready to take at that time. Btw I wouldn't say "Android Messages" is that lightweight btw, notably on modern devices it could be so much smoother :( sam1331 I don't get it either. When Android Messages came out I switched my SMS over to it. I quickly realized I was using it almost exclusively for 2 factor verification codes. But really, the notifications all go to the same place, I already have to decide whether to use Hangouts or Facebook Messenger when talking to basically anyone anyway. I also think people should push a little harder to move conversations over from SMS to something else, I've never found that to be very difficult. mxwp SMS is convenient because you know it will work with any American with a cell phone... including "dumb" flip phones. And it actually is really difficult to get people to switch to another service. Apple users just use imessage to send their SMS to me. And then I send them my glorious green bubbles and those ishills can suck it. YaKillaCJ Sms integration is important because it is supported by 100% of telecommunications service providers and integrated on all devices that can make a phone call and has a screen. You can even sms a home phone without a screen depending on carrier/service provider. Thus it messaging that works with 100% of your contacts. Having multiple Apps spread across 100s of contacts is plain annoying. So if any App wants to be taken serious, it needs to be serious and have sms. What's App already fills the void for bypassing sms across the globe. rndusrnm479461 This answer makes the most sense. Thanks. Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi! play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi We're still new and young but we're very serious about our ambitions and not settling when we know it could/should be better. To fix texting on Android, we provide transparent switch between SMS&IM (devices handshake when you get into chats so that we determine whether you or the recipient has poor reception and should prefer SMS for example). Very handy in some countries/areas/events. And lets you reach *anybody* (that has a phone number). My name is…. Nobody uses SMS no more, and if i wanna send a text message to the last of the Mohicans, i will use my SMS app. I dont want no stupid integration and no stupid 'SMS fallback' that will make things worse. Chatting is not texting. YaKillaCJ There are only 2 widely used methods of messaging across mobile devices. Sms and What's App. Sms is supported on EVERY device from 2 way pagers and flip phones to house phones and smartphones. Any device that has a phone number supports sms. The majority of people doesn't care about added features like stickers and gif. We just care that all I need is the person phone number and from there I can call or text them. That's it. Bottom line is that it has to be a standard adopted by carriers on a worldwide scale. Hence what's app reason for such large scale use is it uses existing phone numbers for login, existing phone book for contact list, free, minimum data usage and encrypted. Even that is still not even used by a third of the devices that use sms. Ryuuie Last I checked, WhatsApp charged $1 or someshit. erptastic It has not done that officially for years. And even before that, they always just extended my account. disqus_Xz3y8OiO3O It's free mxwp in the larger scheme of things, I agree with you that it is not a big deal. still, having one app do both was convenient. the other complaint is Android fanboys being envious of iMessage, which Hangouts could have become. exadeci The main reason that people use Imessage is that you get rich messaging capabilities out of the box if the person you are talking to has an Iphone everything is abstracted, you add someone's number and you start chatting right aways no need to exchange accounts id's or find which app you both use. And if the other doesn't have an Iphone you can still message them or if you killed your data plan it sends an sms. But Google doesn't add sms support because they are pushing for RCS which is a GOOD thing: Standalone Messaging 1-to-1 Chat Group Chat File Transfer Content Sharing Social Presence Information IP Voice call Best Effort Video call Geolocation Exchange Audio Messaging Network based blacklist Capability Exchange based on Presence or SIP OPTIONS All this WITHOUT using any data, data needs an link to be established this doesn't. Chris Hannan It's not hard for most of us to use it. The problem is the people we contact don't want to use separate apps. Everyone with iPhones uses iMessage because it just works by default. But barely anybody I know uses Hangouts and nobody I know uses Allo. If it was all built into one app that shipped with Android phones, more people would use it. Troy Leonard and I removed Hangouts as of today I will no longer consider using any google messaging service ever again Sruly J Isn't Gmail a form of messaging? (Or do you not use Gmail?) Troy Leonard Not for long I'm transitioning over to outlook.com. And upgrading my phone to an iPhone. I'm sick of slow to no updates on my phone,and done with Google ruining everything I ever liked about their apps and Android. naysayer Good riddance. Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi), a new app that we're making that brings a lot of the goodies iMessage brings to iOS users, with big long-term ambitions, and still trying to preserve a consistent and sleek UI. Hopefully that will make you stick to Android and you'll make your iPhone friends jealous in a few months/years ;) Zsolt V Why bother evangilizing? He already decided Outlook on an iPhone is better than Gmail, so let him enjoy it. Troy Leonard Your link is broken Adrien Aubel Fixed thanks! Disqus didn't like the closing ')' at the end of the link. XgudwilX eww outloook😲 Total Insecurity Saying "upgrading my phone to an iPhone" is the same as converting from atheism to any religion. Just a downgrade. bekifft It's true, and their failings and obvious ulterior motives in messaging have, for the first time in a decade, made me consider moving my email back to a private service over which I have control. Roy Thank you and have a nice flight. -Matoro Zeliph- Just want to make sure I'm not missing anything. So Google Voice SMS will no longer work too? Corbin Davenport That will still work as well. Ryne Hager Google voice will still work, just like Fi. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ It's primarily that regular SMS will no longer function in the app. A while back they killed of threading of SMS/MMS and Hangout messages, and now they are killing SMS/MMS entirely out of the app and suggestin people to switch to Android Messages. Bill Blandford Hangouts SMS looks like it still works for Google Voice SMS too. Essentially, this is like Fi, which is a Google Voice number at heart. My wifi-only-device kids use Hangouts to call and text with a Google Voice #. Timmy Turner Yeah GV will continue to work through Hangouts since the number you use via Project-Fi is a GV given number. Adrien Aubel For people that were still using Hangouts and want to try a new app that also does SMS & IM, that tries to provide a fast & polished experience to fix texting on Android, I'd love some honest feedback! https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi We're trying hard to "make it right" and have so much planned on the roadmap, so any feedback is great to have to tweak things up. Let us know what you think! exadeci While the initiative is nice, why would we use your messaging app? If I want an instant message app that does sms and that no one else uses I already got Signal and at least Signal is proven to be secure. What makes Messenger (Facebook), WhatsApp and Imessage good? Their userbase. Ask anyone for a way to communicate and they will use one of those apps, no need for fallback sms when everyone has an account. Adrien Aubel Thanks for your feedback @exadeci:disqus! Great questions :) And Signal is nice as well! It's not for everybody but if you're happy with it keep using it but make sure to check us out in a few months to check that you haven't been missing out, we're going fast! I think there's much more to iMessage that makes it good than their userbase. It is a polished app that just works, and lets you reach anybody, therefore becoming your trusted "go to" texting app. We expect Google to release this summer new capabilities that will let you use IM in more scenarios. Very interesting stuff that we can't wait to let our users benefit from. But our initial target is actually SMS users, people that unlike you and I don't really care about the details, they just want a reliable app that sends and receive their messages. And they're actually quite happy with SMS/MMS in that regard, it just works (when you don't fight with APNs, something we try to prevent as well). We want to transparently "upgrade" those users that may be using Android Messages or a 3rd party app custom-made for the carrier or OEM, not necessarily developed with great care and polishment, and sometimes truly terrible (really, you wouldn't believe what's on some popular carriers, that most users end up using 10 times a day for years). Right now invi is mostly upgrading the transport of your messages and general experience as we develop another big focus of ours: bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages exchanged being plain text. Texting can be the most impersonal way of communication and this flattens relationships. A bar suggests as you type relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps you transmit how you truly felt when writing this message, it doesn't flatten as much your emotions (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). It always send instantly over IM as well (no upload or anything like that, optimized WebP images for super-fast download). Open your top 3 chats on Signal, chats that you have with people you care the most about, look at all this flat plain texting, and try to visualize the gap compared to what it could be, how it could have been more personal and transmitting more of your feelings or emotions. We're targeting this gap, and again, we're just getting started but have serious ambitions and motivation. If you use Snapchat, look at all that rich media that gets thrown to your eyes or that you throw to people, that doesn't always make sense and is often disconnected from conversations, sometimes losing its value and feeling like you just threw a bottle in the ocean, just leaving you with a list of who saw it. We're looking at that gap as well, as invi becomes more and more rich in terms of content creation. After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. We are in talks with some OEMs and resellers to make invi default which would help grow invi's user base and help us improve our product with more diverse usage, while some upcoming features of invi should ultimately help us get a lot more users naturally. exadeci Signal has actually Gifs from Giphy, stickers and the possibility to send a location but I don't use this kind of feature even on Messenger it's quite rare that I send a sticker. Google is strongly pushing for RCS adoption which would add all these emotions sharing: https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Rogers_Google_RCS.gif https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Telenor_6P_GIF_0UHHQdI.gif https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/RCS_Android_Update.width-600.png Adrien Aubel Exactly, but how relevant is Giphy? Again don't compare with things you've seen so far but with what it could potentially be if it truly understood your relationships and intentions, if it combined that with your taste and the way you usually communicate with this specific person. And what if your friends or other people were able to add their own media and stickers through channels and then be discovered, liked and followed, with deep intelligence powering it all and bringing the right content to the right user? We built invi to support all this, we don't just use a Giphy API, we used the most advanced and lightweight technologies to communicate in realtime with our backend, even on pretty bad 3G, from where we curate the media that eventually gets recommended to you. The screenshots you attached look great as well, but see Android Messages is a good example there's only 5 packs of stickers that won't get more relevant or smarter no matter how many stickers you use or how many times you use Android Messages. Idk who would use a given sticker hundreds of times, but anyway I'm not sure those were really representative of how Android Messages is most commonly used. The features are technically there, as often, but they're very limited in their potential as of now. The Awesome Bar isn't for everyone but can eventually help people like you, as images just get displayed while you're typing, no action required, and if you see one that you like you can just tap it to see how it looks and enrich your message, send and you're done. Google is pushing RCS, very true! And we're excited about the great work the Jibe team did in the past couple years. They're a bit shy to share their RCS client implementation at the moment, it may be unstable or not well documented at the moment, but we're meeting regularly with Google and hope to add RCS to our transparent switch as soon as possible, even though the user base is a bit limited at the moment it has the potential to grow fast and solve many issues. If they're reluctant for too long we may use other hubs that would communicate seamlessly through Unified Profile. But for now, we're watching the number of users actually benefiting from RCS grow while we focus on other areas of improvements. sam1331 I am actually kind of optimistic about all this, more so than I was maybe a year ago. They've been putting out a steady stream or improvements to Allo, and when I've experimented with it with a friend it actually is an enjoyable experience. Releasing it without a web app is just shocking, but if that's added and it works well, I could totally see moving over to it from Hangouts, where I do the vast majority of my communicating. The other piece of the puzzle is Duo. If they can integrate a Duo button in Allo conversations (like it seems they will), and they eventually add group calling, which can't be that far off, then I think it will be a nice solution for myself and my family. And I've got quite a few friends that are all about Android instead of iOS, so I can see them switching to Allo from Hangouts. But not until there is a web app, because they aren't stupid. Chad Knasinski I would use Allo if they added SMS support and a desktop version like Hangouts had. Nick.Trite Same here. I have Fi so I'll continue to use Hangouts for SMS. I really love the fact that I can switch seamlessly from desktop to mobile and still be sending SMS. Until Allo does that, I won't consider moving. Chad Knasinski Ditto Sir_Brizz And multi-device support. Can't even use it or sync it on my LTE Tablet... Carson Saldanha So, basically Hangouts but revamped? We've come in full-circle. Sir_Brizz Sure. The problem is that every other chat platform has these features in 2016. Including Hangouts. Roy Me to, love it. mxwp unless they remove hangouts from gmail, people will still secretly be using "hangouts" all the time. in fact, the only way Allo will ever take off without SMS is if it replaces Hangouts (gtalk) on gmail and inbox. Chad Knasinski So correct me if I am wrong here but Google wants us to do this with our messages: SMS - Google Messenger Business SMS - Hangouts Messages - Allo Facebook - Messenger Video Chat - Duo Business Video Chat - Hangouts Video Really? Are you kidding me here? Timmy Turner You've got it right and if there's a joke, you'll being waiting a while for the punchline. disqus_em5YfkbWdk What Business SMS and how is 8t different from other SMS? Zsolt V What does Facebook have to do with anything you wrote? So you are corrected. SpadeX Are you new to tech world? Timmy Turner I recommend Textra to anyone looking for a new SMS app. Sleek, customizable and continually updated/supported. Adrien Aubel Textra is very nice, notably customization-wise as you said, you can go deep and fine-tune basically any UX element. And it's super fast and lightweight as well. I am working as well on a new SMS app that also provides IM similarly to iMessage on iPhone, and many other features, most of them upcoming though. Would you mind giving me a honest feedback when you have the time? It's called invi on the Play Store https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi Timmy Turner Sure thing. freshprince_87 That invi SMS app is an awesome app. Near flawless app. but I stop using it because I kept having problems with MMS messages and also it just like Allo in the sense where if you uninstall the app and reinstall it on the same phone all your instant messages are all gone including some of the regular SMS /MMS messages. You need to make the app save all your messages on to an account like a Google account in the cloud. So that no matter what device you use the instant messages will still be there. Adrien Aubel @freshprince_87:disqus Thank you for your feedback! MMS can be very tricky and every carrier has its own set of specificities, I'm sorry about that, it shows we're still young but obviously like you said, such a core functionality bug makes our whole effort worthless for you here. Do you mind sharing your carrier, device model, and Android version? Did you try using "Legacy MMS" in the app settings? About the IM sync, that's an issue we're definitely looking into, considering all potential security and privacy issues, notably as some countries like USA recycle pretty aggressively your phone numbers, and with the desire to bring a Web client in mind. Google should announce this summer APIs that will eventually help us regarding security, so stay tuned :) freshprince_87 Thanks. I didn't use the legacy MMS. I hope that you add the IM sync soon. I'm on a T-Mobile service using the Moto Z Play on Android Nougat 7.0 Adrien Aubel Ok thank you, if you don't mind I have other questions to dive into your problem :) What specifically was failing? MMS sending, receiving, or both? Did it show an error? Is it only on group MMS or all MMS? Whatever information you may have will be helpful. Our next release should bring MMS reliability improvements and notably Wifi texting when supported by the carrier (first MMS may send up to 60s to send as we're trying out routes but then all other Wifi MMS should send very fast). Tom Westrick https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5ecvBaqHBk MJ Thank God I use Project Fi otherwise this would suck big time for me. TJ Mills Thank God I have Google voice.... Dracono Love hangouts never used SMS. It also seems most negative reviews about it being slow was always tired to the SMS feature. I'm now curious with the removal of they'll us the opportunity to evolve or let it idle. mxwp it will evolve into a business app... but hopefully still available for consumers VAVAMk_2 Just give us SMS support in Allo for Christ's sake! Adrien Aubel SMS/MMS can be quite hard to deal with technically and Google didn't choose to go that way. It is possibly also due to the push they did to replace the default SMS app on many OEMs and carriers, strategically it's hard for them to push much of Google's agenda through the SMS app they give carriers, and they're mostly limited to SMS/RCS. Roy Christ will not give you SMS, bat Star of David could promise you RCS in Allo. mxwp Big G repeatedly stated it would never happen tim242 Liar. Adrien Aubel https://twitter.com/amitfulay/status/840236304130428928 Roy Great. It's was the plan all along. Now Allow will get RCS and web browser everything gonna integrate with Duo. I'm all the way in. I never like Hangout. I love Allo. #stop stop babies don't you cry. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I don't think that's possible. RCS is still mainly just an extension of SMS. If it doesn't support SMS, I don't see it handling RCS. Roy When RCS will come it will be with SMS already. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Based on what? Besnik Rrustemi No problem guys,we have like 69 other Messaging Apps by Google to choose from and maybe 2 new others coming soon. Roy Haha it's so old. Can someone can come with new jokes here? Besnik Rrustemi Well sorry Old Man then, never knew your age before. * Respect for Old People * Sir_Brizz Let the confusion officially begin! Indianajonze google can go fk themselves Robert Gerhart Why isn't anybody asking the bigger question: why the hell does anyone use outdated SMS in the first place? It's like complaining that Hangouts doesn't integrate butter churns and wagon wheels either. There is nothing more annoying than a text message. Adrien Aubel SMS is always nice to have in some situations, that happen more or less depending on where you live. Uncovered areas, concerts or big games, people having no LTE-enabled plans, or simply on some roads and highways. In USA for example all those scenarios happen a lot, notably in some states. And eventually, in most countries you still use SMS for 3rd party services, banks, transportation, or even government-related messages. Most importantly, in countries that still use SMS you can reach *anybody you know* from one app. And that's really a great thing to have. Now you're right, IM is so much more pleasant. Instant delivery, read status, last active time, way faster image format and transport. At invi ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi ) we try to take advantage of this and combine both the way it should be. When you open a chat with somebody, we trigger a handshake to check that both you and the recipient are well connected. If one of both doesn't answer on time, it simply switches to SMS/MMS, it's automatic and out of your way. Otherwise you take advantage of state-of-the-art transport with some unique optimizations. Try to send a GIF over IM and see how fast it goes, compared to MMS or even Whatsapp. Let me know what you think! Aaron Simple; SMS is ubiquitous. Every cellular device in operation can send and receive SMS, from the most current and expensive flagships like the iPhone and Galaxy, to the cheapest budget devices, all the way down to the oldest flip phones. I can text my dad on his flip, my wife on her Nexus or my Capt on his iPhone and each one will receive that message and reply. Show me an IM that can do all of that (that isn't on the iPhone). I guess that invi app that guy's been pedaling might, but I'm waiting for it to gain some traction before trying to convince anybody to switch to yet another IM. Rod The rest of the world uses Whatsapp, everyone has it installed. JG Even people with generic flip phones? Rod Nope, but I don't remember the last time I saw someone with a flip phone. The poor now bear Galaxy Win/Pocket/etc JG My aunt still has one. She recently attempted to upgrade to a smartphone but that seems to have failed big time... Apparently my telling her to tap the icon that's labeled "EMAIL" to get her email is too complicated... That and the free phone she got is a PoS... 512MB of RAM and only 4GB of storage - with the OS consuming all but like 100MB there of. So it didn't perform quite so hot. She seemed a bit surprised her free phone didn't perform as well as my Pixel XL does... TJ Mills Everyone in China uses Wi chat. Rod USA is a world apart. lomsha Believe it or not, even 2g is still a luxury in some countries, which makes​ instant messaging iffy. In those cases sms is a great alternative. Not everyone is in the 1st world with a sweet smartphone and reliable data access. TJ Mills Standard is better than better. When someone comes up with a universal replacement that works on all classes of phones, then the world can switch. Until then it's a mishmash of services and applications​to communicate. Why does everyone still use email? Because of the standards. Michael Sørensen Convince me why I shouldn't... Currently I can write to anyone for free without first asking them what their preferred platform is. And they can reply for free regardless of said preferred platform. Again, convince me why that's not good enough? And don't say "stickers". Just don't. Security? Bah, no sensitive information sent. Midnitte At this point, I'm held hostage stuck using Hangouts since it's the only thing that natively supports desktop messaging. Sigh. Lord Argyris "Each has its disadvantages, though. The latter doesn't have quite the same feature set that Hangouts did, and the former is a Facebook product." It's lines like these that keep.me coming back to AP. JD My support for Google and their messaging platforms ended the beginning of May. Kelly Clubb Well this sucks for any user that enjoyed an easy to use sms app. I use Hangouts and thankfully for project fi will continue it's support BossMa1n3 Eh..doesn't effect me stop using hangout for sms awhile ago..more interested in a flat screen phone with side bezels as thin as the one in the pic.. Grey PLEASE Bring Hangouts Chat and Hangouts Meet to all users. That has so many new and awesome features. It's like everything Allo isn't. DragoCubed The comment section is rough b_boogey_xl Bye Hangouts! hp-fourtwenty oh ffs...voice is still supported??? hell yeah!! nxtiak I'm waiting for the day G+ contacts disappear from Hangouts. I hate how on PC when I type a name to start a conversation it lists random people on G+. SHOW ME THE NAMES FROM MY DAMN CONTACTS GOOGLE!!!!!!!!! Maave RIP Hangouts. I had group chats, Google Voice, and SMS all in one. Now my group chats have moved to Telegram but I'm still stuck with nerfed Hangouts for GV.

Editorial: Assistant is the key to Google's Android Automotive project Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/22 10:46am PDTMay 22, 2017 8 Plus 1 on G+ 28 Share on Facebook 45 Share on Twitter Total Shares81 Android OS News Videos Google spent much of the I/O 2017 keynote talking about machine learning. In fact, we heard the phrase "AI first" as a description of Google's current plans. You probably have a little sliver of Google's AI capabilities in your pocket right now—Google Assistant. There's one place in particular Google really wants Assistant to live, and that's in your car. Voice commands in general are extremely well-suited to the car, so it should come as no surprise that Google had two Assistant-infused "Android Automotive" demos on-hand at I/O—one from Volvo (above) and another from Audi. It's more clear now than ever that Google wants to be the smart interface for your car, and it plans to do it with Assistant. Your car with Android The Android Automotive project (just an internal name for now) was rumored in 2016, and the first demo of such a system was showcased at CES early this year. This is distinct from Android Auto, which Google released alongside Lollipop. However, it took several months before the first aftermarket head units and new cars arrived with support for the platform. Progress on Auto has been slow ever since. It does barely anything now that it couldn't do at launch. Perhaps that's because Google is currently more interested in making Android the car's operating system. With Android Auto, your phone simply projects an interface to the car's display, but Android Automotive is a car that actually runs Android as its infotainment system. There have been cars running Android before—many Honda and Hyundai vehicles still do, actually. They're very old builds that are almost completely unrecognizable as Android, though. By working with automakers, Google can make the interface more modern and get its services embedded in the car. The two Android Automotive concepts being demoed at I/O were surprisingly full-featured. Check out our video from the event if you want to see how Android in the car actually works. One of the first things you'll notice about this new take on Android in the car is that it's fast... well, faster than Android Auto. Android Auto tends to lag heavily at times for no discernible reason. The fact that it's still preferable to the stock in-car software is a testament to how little automakers have innovated in this space. The two interfaces demoed were also very different from each other, indicating Google might give automakers even more freedom to modify Android than phone OEMs do. Actually, the Volvo interface was visually similar to Volvo's current software (which is not Nougat, obviously). Both demos were based on Android 7.0 with an eye toward migrating to Android O when it's final. Importantly, Android Automotive runs Google services and Android apps without connecting an Android phone. The apps are essentially the same as the ones you currently use in Android Auto. They're limited to audio and messaging apps, and you do have to wonder how long those apps and services will be up to date. Phone updates can take ages, and cars could be much worse. Assistant everywhere An often expressed fear is that a car with Android-based infotainment features will eventually become extremely outdated. After all, you keep a car much longer than you do a phone. Will the apps and services running on that car ever be updated? Will developers eventually drop support for in-car apps on these older versions of Android? There are a lot of unknowns right now. Audi's Demo Googlers seem to have a go-to line when you ask about updates to Android-infused cars—they talk about Project Treble. Google is cognizant of the fact that automakers seldom update the software on cars, but the hope is that updates will still happen occasionally if Google can make it easier. There's also a lot of talk about Assistant in the car, and I had several Googlers cite this as a way to make apps and services more accessible while you're driving regardless of what version of Android your car runs. Apps installed in the car might not be updated very quickly (or at all), but that's not a concern in the cloud. After connecting an app or service to Assistant, it's accessible from your phone, a Google Home, Android Auto, or even a car running Android that hasn't seen an update lately. Thus, developers don't necessarily have to worry about specifically supporting old versions of Android in the car, they simply need to take advantage of Assistant. You can do things with Assistant voice commands that are very much outside the bounds of road-safe media and messaging apps. Assistant's smarter voice commands have the potential to be extremely useful while you're driving. There was a wall of smart home devices next to the Volvo car in order to demonstrate how you could adjust your humble abode in advance of your arrival. Hot day? Crank the AC before you roll into the driveway. You also have more control over the car with Assistant as part of the car's OS—for instance, you could control the climate or open the sunroof, which isn't feasible in Android Auto. Having Assistant built into the car also means more people will use it. Even iOS users who don't have an Android phone to plug in will be able to use Assistant in these vehicles, and that gets them into the Google ecosystem. Assistant is very much hit or miss right now. Sometimes you ask Assistant a question or issue a command only to be greeted with a cloyingly polite apology. Still, it's getting better, and some of the things Google demoed could be great experiences. Regardless of possible update issues down the road, Google's involvement with car infotainment will lead to more modern versions of Android at launch, and Assistant could help your car's software remain useful.

A customized "Hey KITT" trigger phase would be great to, though doubtful they'd ever make one without Google in it.

It barely got more functional since its introduction and will only languish more now that Google has moved on. The thing I don't like is the car being data independent. That's the beauty of the "projection" method of Android Auto. I don't want to live in a future where I have a data connection for my phone, my tablet, my watch, my car, my refrigerator, my washer, and my dryer. I want a data connection for my phone and everything else to be able to piggy-back off of that. whispy_snippet I really doubt it's dead. What about the millions of people who don't intend to buy a car for years or have just bought a car with Android Auto? The majority of people sit in this category. Sure, "Automotive" is probably the future. But I think Android Auto has plenty more to come. leganzish I'm not saying its going to disappear of the face of the earth tomorrow. Just that it will languish. It has already had fairly slow adoption. I would expect adoption rates to slow now that Google has tipped their hand on the next automotive initiative. If consumers get frustrated at the Hangouts situation, I think the very careful/conservative (when it comes to tech progress) automotive brands will be extremely hesitant to invest in Android Auto when it appears to have fallen out of Google's favor. whispy_snippet Hmmm I'm still not convinced. For one, getting car makers to adopt Android Auto has been challenging enough. Convincing hundreds of car makers to suddenly drop their existing operating systems and hand full control to Google is going to take a lot of persuasion and a lot of time. In the short to mid term it's going to be easier to convince car makers to offer a "plug and play" connectivity feature that consumers demand, without the need to cede full control to Google. Remember, a lot of people use iPhones and will demand Apple CarPlay in their next vehicle. Do you think Apple is going to develop a CarPlay app for Android Automotive? I've no doubt Android Automotive is what Google sees as the end goal. But developing a full featured car OS from the ground up, for every single car maker, is an enormous task. In the meantime there are millions and millions of car owners out there with no intention of buying a new vehicle for years. Google has recognised this and its why Android Auto can now run as a stand alone app on phones. And because this app can run on millions of phones, it offers developers plenty of incentive to support it (and thus support Android Auto as a platform broadly). Filipe Santos Car Assistant first, Waze last JasonIvers Android Automotive is still better than some proprietary junk infotainment system from a car manufacturer, even if it's never updated at all. At least you have a reasonably good chance third-party developers will actually build something for it without having to be paid to do so. whispy_snippet My biggest worry about our new world of connected cars is security. Just wait until someone hacks a vehicle's control inputs and causes a crash. What are Google, Apple, car manufacturers, etc going to do about this looming question? abqnm I think that would come down to car manufacturers hardening and isolating essential control systems so they can't be accessed in the event the infotainment system is hacked and somehow allows access to the CAN-BUS. Still, even with access to CAN-BUS, proprietary software over encrypted connections is generally required to access control systems. So it's not like someone can just hack the infotainment system and suddenly can control your steering remotely. There would be a massive amount of protocol reverse-engineering work needed, and it would be on a per-model, per-software build, per-control surface basis. The Jeep exploit that was demoed a couple years back required them to reverse engineer and spend many hundreds of hours to do so. It's a concern, sure, but not a major one. whispy_snippet If a car being hacked could result in someone's death then I would consider it a major concern. The reputation of connected cars and their associated manufacturers and developers are at stake. Just one death as a result of a car being hacked could ripple through the media and cause millions to question the safety of something like Android Automotive. I obviously don't understand how one would hack a car and I'm sure it's ridiculously complex. But if it's possible, I really hope the companies that have our lives in their hands are doing everything they can to mitigate a disaster. It might sound dramatic, but I think it's really important to keep asking these questions. Software exploits are rare, but every now and again we see even the big companies drop the ball (Apple with its iCloud brute force hack, Google with its Google Docs exploit, Microsoft and the ransomware attack). If computers and software are vulnerable, that makes cars with computers and software vulnerable. And when you're hurtling along at 60mph that's well worth our concern. abqnm Since it relies on assistant, does that mean that all cars must now have a data connection? Does or can it use the phone's data connection? There was no indication of connection sharing in the Volvo demo. I really don't want to see cars that I have to pay a monthly subscription fee for a data connection just to be able to tell it to turn off my seat heater. RyanWhitwam The demo cars both had dedicated LTE. That's the way it works right now. Presumably, it would be possible to share the data connection, but that would be up to automakers. whispy_snippet Surely a wireless charging pad with NFC that triggers a WiFi tether arrangement makes sense. Every phone in the near future and onward is going to have wireless charging - we just need an agreed standard of course... ekngee i think Android Automotive is more of a motive-ational push to say "hey, it's easy to use Android to build your infotainment system, rather than do your own from scratch". Android Auto should still stay, because as stated, updates are a big unknown, so i'd rather be safe updating my phone than the car. SAM Few years down the road, people will be talking about android fragmentation on cars, how only 1% of cars are on latest Android version and Android O still wont die.

 Alphabet isn't fooling around with Google Lens Evan Niu, The Motley Fool May 22, 2017, 6:47 PM 5,019 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google Forget goofy video filters -- Alphabet's Google is skipping all that in favor of a more functional approach. Snap's meteoric rise in popularity has been driven largely by its live video filters, or Lenses, that overlay various types of visual effects in real time. These are but one of many features that larger rival Facebook has replicated, recently launching a Camera Effects Platform as its big push into augmented reality (AR) that will complement its concurrent efforts to expand virtual reality (VR). Heck, even Apple is getting in on the fun with its recent Clips app. It goes without saying that live video filters only appeal to a modest subset of users, while AR-based search has incredible potential for mainstream functionalities. Enter Google Lens Of all the things that the search giant announced at its I/O developer conference opening keynote this week, Google Lens is easily the most impressive. With Google Lens, your smartphone camera won’t just see what you see, but will also understand what you see to help you take action. #io17 pic.twitter.com/viOmWFjqk1 — Google (@Google) May 17, 2017 Google Lens will leverage its ongoing advances in machine learning and neural nets and be able to identify objects, and then deliver actionable information based on what it sees. Examples include identifying a flower species, looking up restaurant reviews, real-time language translation, and more. The technology will first make its way to Google Photos later this year, and will subsequently be integrated into Google Assistant, as well. Google Lens is very much the spiritual successor to Google Goggles, which the search giant launched way back in 2010 with mostly the same purpose: using your smartphone camera to search for things. Google discontinued Goggles in 2014 since it wasn't really being used. However, computer vision technology has come a long way since then, as has awareness of AR as a technology and its potential. This is what the AR market needs Strategically, it makes a lot more sense to approach AR from a functional standpoint than a recreational one. Using Google Lens as a visual search tool that can provide information to mainstream consumers fits perfectly within Google's broader mission, and that's exactly what the AR market needs right now: a compelling mainstream use case. That's especially true if AR hopes for a shot at becoming the next major computing platform. For most of the other companies, AR-based video filters are just a starting point for broader AR ambitions. It's not as if Clips helps Apple sell more iPhones, but mainstream AR functions might if included in future iPhones. It should be obvious that Apple has grand plans for AR that will include more functional applications; when we see those plans is another matter altogether. Get the latest Google stock price here.

An internal email filed in a Google employee’s lawsuit against the company alleges that Google has put in place a tipline for Googlers to be able to blow the whistle on company whistleblowers. By Rex Crum | rcrum@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group PUBLISHED: May 22, 2017 at 3:46 pm | UPDATED: May 22, 2017 at 3:46 pm Top of the Order:   The CIA, the KGB, and now, Google?: Remember in those young and innocent days of Google, when the company wasn’t much more than the best internet search engine around, and its motto, as laid out by founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin was simply, “Don’t be evil”? Well, times have changed. Google has gotten bigger. Way bigger, in fact, as it now has its hands in everything from smartphones to self-driving car technology. Its name may still be Google, but for more than a year now, its official corporate banner reads Alphabet. And as with any company that evolves, some of its policies and traditions evolve, too. But does that evolution involve being evil? Related Articles Biz Break: AT&T strike may close your local store this weekend Biz Break: Investors feed on latest Pandora sale reports Biz Break: Apple gets cranking on iPhones in India Biz Break: How well Facebook stops “fake” news is up for debate Biz Break: WannaCry attack gives boost to security software makers That’s the assertion from an anonymous Google employee, who has filed suit against the company alleging that it runs an internal program of spying on employees as a means of ferreting out workers who leak Google information to the press or other outside sources. The lawsuit alleges that the Google program is operating in violation of California labor law. Now, a new filing in the lawsuit includes an internal email purportedly from a Google employee named Brian Katz, whose signature reads “Director, Protective Services, Investigations & Intelligence.” Or, as Katz put it in the email, “I lead the investigations team,” which includes the company’s stopleaks@ program. The email also references a transcript of an internal, all-hands meeting at Google that was leaked to the tech news website Recode last year. Many large companies have policies, and sometimes software and services, to make sure their employees aren’t messing around on websites or doing other things they shouldn’t be doing when they are on company time. So, it should be no surprise that Google would want to ensure that stuff it doesn’t want to get out to the public doesn’t get out to the public. Katz seemed to really want to get the message across to all “Googlers” that leaking confidential information was not a good thing. “If your’re considering leaking confidential information to a reporter — or to anyone else externally — for the love of all that’s Googley, please reconsider!” It’s hard to imagine the director of investigations at, say, the CIA, using a term like “Googley” to implore employees to keep their mouths shut. But, Google has always claimed to be a different kind of company, even in reference to what it considers to be holy. Or, Googley, as the case may be. Middle Innings: Well, He Would Know: Evan Williams’ fingerprints are all over the internet as we know it today. Along with Jack Dorsey and Biz Stone, Williams co-founded Twitter. Williams also co-founded the blogging site Blogger, and founded the longer-form web publishing site Medium. And now Williams is sorry. In an interview that ran in the New York Times over the weekend, Williams, who seems to take himself and his very hipster look very seriously, apologized. You get three guess as to what he apologized for, as long as each guess is “President Donald Trump.” “It’s a very bad thing, Twitter’s role in that,” Williams told the Times of the part that Twitter may have played in Trump’s presidential victory last November. Trump, who loves to use Twitter to put his messages out, has said that he wouldn’t be president without the social-media platform. And in response to that, Williams wants everyone to know how badly he feels about Twitter’s role in Trump being in the White House. “If it’s true that he wouldn’t be president if it weren’t for Twitter, then yeah, I’m sorry.” Not Even as a Write-In?: Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg is a busy man. As if having one small child, and another one on the way, and needing to make time to visit his 700-acre compound on Kauai weren’t enough, Zuckerberg has set a goal of visiting and talking to people in all 50 states this year. Among the places Zuckerberg has been is the Ford Motor plant in Dearborn, Michigan, where in April, he helped build some F-150 trucks. Zuckerberg’s magical mystery tour around the country has sparked speculation that he may be planning to run for public office sometime soon. However, Zuckerberg shot down those rumors (at least for now) by saying in a blog post that his “listening tour” is not meant to help him test the water for a possible future in politics. What a shame. With Dwayne Johnson talking about running for president in 2020, who wouldn’t vote for a Rock-Zuck ticket in three years? Hey, we’ve done stranger things in our elections before.

Google promptly responded with a blog post and tried to clear some air. A few months later, the Mountain View giant got a bit more blunt about it. As reported by Reuters, it seems that a conclusion is now closer than ever, with the European Commission preparing to deliver verdicts on the cases within the “next few months”. The Commission has accused Google of abusing its position in the online advertising market and hindering competition, using Android's dominant position to push its services, and prioritizing its own product shopping business over the competition in search results. If the Commission finds Google guilty of breaking EU’s antitrust rules, it could potentially levy record fines per each case. "In the next few months, we will reach a decision on the Google cases, Google search, AdSense and to me the most interesting is Android”, Tommaso Valletti, the Commission’s Chief Competition Economist, shared with a conference organized by the University of Oxford Center for Competition Law and Policy. The EU have proven to be tough grounds for tech giants over the years; Microsoft faced a landmark judgment back in 2004, with Facebook’s case being more recent. Apple has also been part of a major tussle with regards to its tax payments in Europe. Google recently found itself making a few compromises in Russia, allowing Yandex and other search engines to be presented as a choice during Android’s setup process. The European Commission’s investigation goes beyond Android, but Google’s compromise in Russia does stand as an example of what could be possible in the European Union.

U.S. Editions Australia Edition China Edition India Edition Italy Edition Japan Edition Singapore Edition United Kingdom United States May 23, 2:49 AM EDT Subscribe Search Search Business Technology World National Media & Culture Millennial Money Entertainment Sports Subscribe Technology Kotlin, Google Lens And Everything Showcased At Google I/O 2017 By Fionna Agomuoh @FionnaatIBT On 05/22/17 AT 7:36 PM Close Google I/O 2017 culminated Friday, but tech circuits are still abuzz about the many announcements that came out of the conference. Several new products, features within products and initiatives were announced at Google I/O and should be prominent throughout the rest of 2017. As with many Google conferences, the tech giant announced the latest figures of its continued growth, which include over 2 billion active users on Android and over 1 billion monthly users on each of its major platforms, including Google Search, Android, Play Store, Gmail, Chrome, YouTube and Google Maps. Here’s a rundown of the other announcements and details shared during Google I/O 2017. Google Lens Google Lens is essentially a search engine, which uses images and videos instead of words. By opening a smartphone camera app, users can identify objects, places, and other things and get contextual information about the images subject as well as suggestions for functions to execute. One example demonstrated during I/O was using Google Lens to capture the login information for a wireless router and automatically sign into the network. Google Assistant For iPhone Google Assistant is now also available for the iPhone. While Apple likely won’t get rid of Siri anytime soon, Google Assistant on an iPhone may prove to be the AI equivalent of iOS users favoring Google Maps to Apple Maps. Daydream 2.0 Euphrates The second generation of Google’s Daydream VR platform is called Daydream 2.0 Euphrates. Users can expect various new features such as being able to project a Google Daydream experience onto a TV using Chromecast. The overall theme of Daydream 2.0 is for users to be able to use the headset throughout an entire VR session without having to take it off. Google also announced that users will be able to open Chrome within a VR experience and see the browser in 360-degrees. Users will also be able to watch YouTube VR and connect with others via a live voice chat feature. Standalone VR Headset Google’s original Daydream VR headsets require a smartphone to be its screen, content and power source. However, the tech giant will collaborate with HTC, Lenovo, and Qualcomm to bring standalone VR headsets to the market in late 2017. These headsets won’t require a smartphone or a PC to function. First iterations of the headsets will feature modified a version of the Snapdragon 835 chip and special sensors called WorldSense, to help users remain oriented within a headset. New Programming Language Kotlin is the first new programming language being added to Google’s products and services, which have natively run Java and C++. The language is expected to simplify coding for Android developers, in particular, as an alternate option for Java. Developers will be able to add Kotlin code on top of Java code or use Kotlin code independently. Google Photos Updates Google Photos has received several new features, including Suggested Sharing and Shared Libraries. The former brings up suggestions of contacts to share photos with, based on the subject of the photo. The latter allows users to create photo libraries, which they can share with selected contacts. Once a library has been shared it will update automatically when new photos are added; based on how users have set the library to save content. Other new features utilize machine learning to edit photos without prompts from a user. One example included Google Photos combining several photos with a lot of background noise into one clearer image. Another example removed the chain-link fence obstructing a little girl at the plate, during her softball game. Users can also now order Photos Books, a 20-page printed booklet version of their favorite images, which start at $9.99. Users can select images and purchase their Photo Book within the Google Photos app. Google Home Updates The smart home AI assistant, Google Home, got a host of updates during Google I/O. Easily one of the one of the exciting is the hands-free calling ability, which can differentiate between the voices of different users. Google Home also now supports voice launch for streaming services including HBO Go and Hulu, free Spotify, Bluetooth speaker capabilities and the ability to project search responses onto screens, including televisions and smartphones. Google Home will soon be available in new languages including Brazilian Portuguese, French, German and Japanese, Italian, Korean and Spanish and in new markets including Australia, Canada, France, German, and Japan. Daydream And Tango Updates  Google is finally expanding its Daydream VR support to several 2017 devices, including the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus and an LG device releasing later this summer. Rumors suggest the device may be the LG V30. Additionally, the Asus Zenfone AR is launching later this summer, which will bring the augmented reality initiative Google Tango to the market. Other Updates Of Google Services Several other services received minor updates, including Google Assistant, which now has a type feature and a shortcuts feature, which allows users to set shorter questions for faster answers. Gmail now has a smart replies feature, which will give options for a short email response, in accordance with the original message. User’s payment information will now be linked across all of Google’s payment systems, including Android Pay, Google Play, Chrome and soon also Google Assistant. Users will also be able to view 360-degree videos on their TVs via Android TV or Xbox One. Stock Android will now feature a notifications dot, which will indicate when there are updates on certain applications. Revamped Services Google has also introduced some new services, which are essentially replacements for olders, less viable services. Find My Device is a more efficient version of Android Device Manager. Find My Device includes a Last Known Location feature and improved Wi-Fi and battery details, to make finding a lost device easier. Android in the car will be built into vehicles and is being tested by Volvo and Audi, while Android Auto was an application, which had to be connected to a car through a smartphone. Jobs Search Engine Google announced its plans to rollout a new initiative, called Google for Jobs, which will help pair job seekers with the right job listings for them. Android O Public Beta Google also showcased many new features, which will release on Android O later this summer. The first developer beta is now available to the public.

Programmatic campaigns are the championship rounds when it comes to transforming consumer interest into action. One of the latest testing tools for marketers is Google Optimize. Google has offered Optimize as part of Google Analytics 360, the enterprise measurement suite that competes with alternatives like Adobe Analytics.  Google now offers Optimize for its basic Google Analytics service, as well as integration with Google Data Studio (I discussed details of Data Studio in this post).  The move is meant to allow the integration of a test application with a tag manager and analytics solution. The ultimate objective for Google is to get marketers viewing Google as a complete measurement solution. Optimize brings the right features to accomplish that task. Setting up Optimize. To start, users manage Google Optimize via an online user interface. Users add a Google Optimize tag to a website in a similar fashion to a tag manager container. If you are aware of containers in web design, you get the general idea of what it is  – a framework to hold a script.  An Optimize container can be labeled in the user interface with a name to match your campaign, with the label no longer than 255 text characters. To set test pages, Optimize includes a visual editor. The visual editor lets users create a test page variant without recoding of a site each time a test is issued.  Once the Optimize tag is installed, users can create an experiment. An experiment is the intended test, meant to determine which variation is the most effective at achieving a specific objective on a website or web app element. There are three experiment settings: A/B, Redirect, and Multivariate. A/B is a random test of using two or more variants of the same web page. Each variant is served at similar time so that the performance can be observed and measured in the pen of external factors Redirect is a split test that permits testing separate web pages against each other, be it two different landing pages or a page redesign with different URLs. Multivariate test inspects two or more elements simultaneously to see which combination creates the best outcome. Objectives Once users have decided on an experiment, the next step is actually to consider what results are anticipted.  That's where Google Optimize "objectives" come in. Objectives play a similar role in Optimize that goals play in Google Analytics reports – they are results expected from the website or web app elements being updated.  In test parlance an objective is a hypothesis: an educated guess, validated or invalidated by the experiment.   Google has made the choice of objectives a simple selection.  Up to three pre-selected objectives can be chosen for a given experiment. Targeting Targeting lets users add a detail associated with the target audience for the experiment. The percentage of the visitors who will see an experiment can be planned, based on coding elements, such as cookie or JavaScript element fired, or set according to a URL or path rule. This allows consideration of the path flow to which a visitor will see a tested page or tested elephant. Participant attributes are the most interesting feature because they can incorporate key assumptions in user behaviors.  Time of day, demographics, and user devices can be a set factor for when the experiment can be shown.   Ultimately, targeting offers a range of ways to limit the experiment to a specific intended audience. How better testing improves campaigns The targeting features in Optimize reflect the machine learning capability deployed in Google Optimize A/B testing. Adobe applied a machine learning upgrade with its Test and Target solution.   Using machine learning in conducting A/B test increases test accuracy.   Tests can automatically be run with appropriate sample size balanced against conditions that are a reasonable influence on choice. Moreover, that balance allows the introduction of Bayesian probability for testing.  Bayesian probability is based on adjusting the likelihood for a hypothesis to be valid when more evidence or information becomes available during a test.  That perspective is essential, with more marketing campaigns relying on automation where conditions are not solely defined by web technicalities or code.  Direct email campaigns are a great example. Because more emails are opened in mobile devices, marketers must consider what real world actions — like arriving at a store — are in play, on top of code-related page influences like a button size, image or text. Accounting for real-world conditions enhances frequency-based test questions.  Instead of just focusing on how many test runs are needed, the machine learning capacity in the latest analytic test solutions can interpret real-time decisions associated with testing a call to action, or the time of day that an email is sent.  That is an essential distinction for emails opened in smartphones, with users on the go, and seeing real world influences in the moment of engaging with the email. With Optimize, the benefits of better predictability, test accuracy, and ease of implementation, can lead to better campaigns. It's one solution that can raise marketers' games to championship level.

Editorial: Assistant is the key to Google's Android Automotive project Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/22 10:46am PDTMay 22, 2017 8 Plus 1 on G+ 28 Share on Facebook 45 Share on Twitter Total Shares81 Android OS News Videos Google spent much of the I/O 2017 keynote talking about machine learning. In fact, we heard the phrase "AI first" as a description of Google's current plans. You probably have a little sliver of Google's AI capabilities in your pocket right now—Google Assistant. There's one place in particular Google really wants Assistant to live, and that's in your car. Voice commands in general are extremely well-suited to the car, so it should come as no surprise that Google had two Assistant-infused "Android Automotive" demos on-hand at I/O—one from Volvo (above) and another from Audi. It's more clear now than ever that Google wants to be the smart interface for your car, and it plans to do it with Assistant. Your car with Android The Android Automotive project (just an internal name for now) was rumored in 2016, and the first demo of such a system was showcased at CES early this year. This is distinct from Android Auto, which Google released alongside Lollipop. However, it took several months before the first aftermarket head units and new cars arrived with support for the platform. Progress on Auto has been slow ever since. It does barely anything now that it couldn't do at launch. Perhaps that's because Google is currently more interested in making Android the car's operating system. With Android Auto, your phone simply projects an interface to the car's display, but Android Automotive is a car that actually runs Android as its infotainment system. There have been cars running Android before—many Honda and Hyundai vehicles still do, actually. They're very old builds that are almost completely unrecognizable as Android, though. By working with automakers, Google can make the interface more modern and get its services embedded in the car. The two Android Automotive concepts being demoed at I/O were surprisingly full-featured. Check out our video from the event if you want to see how Android in the car actually works. One of the first things you'll notice about this new take on Android in the car is that it's fast... well, faster than Android Auto. Android Auto tends to lag heavily at times for no discernible reason. The fact that it's still preferable to the stock in-car software is a testament to how little automakers have innovated in this space. The two interfaces demoed were also very different from each other, indicating Google might give automakers even more freedom to modify Android than phone OEMs do. Actually, the Volvo interface was visually similar to Volvo's current software (which is not Nougat, obviously). Both demos were based on Android 7.0 with an eye toward migrating to Android O when it's final. Importantly, Android Automotive runs Google services and Android apps without connecting an Android phone. The apps are essentially the same as the ones you currently use in Android Auto. They're limited to audio and messaging apps, and you do have to wonder how long those apps and services will be up to date. Phone updates can take ages, and cars could be much worse. Assistant everywhere An often expressed fear is that a car with Android-based infotainment features will eventually become extremely outdated. After all, you keep a car much longer than you do a phone. Will the apps and services running on that car ever be updated? Will developers eventually drop support for in-car apps on these older versions of Android? There are a lot of unknowns right now. Audi's Demo Googlers seem to have a go-to line when you ask about updates to Android-infused cars—they talk about Project Treble. Google is cognizant of the fact that automakers seldom update the software on cars, but the hope is that updates will still happen occasionally if Google can make it easier. There's also a lot of talk about Assistant in the car, and I had several Googlers cite this as a way to make apps and services more accessible while you're driving regardless of what version of Android your car runs. Apps installed in the car might not be updated very quickly (or at all), but that's not a concern in the cloud. After connecting an app or service to Assistant, it's accessible from your phone, a Google Home, Android Auto, or even a car running Android that hasn't seen an update lately. Thus, developers don't necessarily have to worry about specifically supporting old versions of Android in the car, they simply need to take advantage of Assistant. You can do things with Assistant voice commands that are very much outside the bounds of road-safe media and messaging apps. Assistant's smarter voice commands have the potential to be extremely useful while you're driving. There was a wall of smart home devices next to the Volvo car in order to demonstrate how you could adjust your humble abode in advance of your arrival. Hot day? Crank the AC before you roll into the driveway. You also have more control over the car with Assistant as part of the car's OS—for instance, you could control the climate or open the sunroof, which isn't feasible in Android Auto. Having Assistant built into the car also means more people will use it. Even iOS users who don't have an Android phone to plug in will be able to use Assistant in these vehicles, and that gets them into the Google ecosystem. Assistant is very much hit or miss right now. Sometimes you ask Assistant a question or issue a command only to be greeted with a cloyingly polite apology. Still, it's getting better, and some of the things Google demoed could be great experiences. Regardless of possible update issues down the road, Google's involvement with car infotainment will lead to more modern versions of Android at launch, and Assistant could help your car's software remain useful.

At least for me. Impatiently waiting... ShahinTr All we need is our Assistant to be voiced as Kitt. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7d287ac75059f48cc9bac82680837bc707448769b35d9a2c20ef2af572856780.jpg JG That would be awesome... A customized "Hey KITT" trigger phase would be great to, though doubtful they'd ever make one without Google in it. Daniel Actually, now that we have an SDK for Google Assistant, I'm pretty sure that's very close to happening. Leon I'd also settle for Majel Barrett. Drinster I think the UI looks terrible the demo from last year in the Maserati looks way more better. Rawhi Mohammad SEXXXXXXY I WANT IT.. #APKPLZ xfullmetal17 Because the OEMs hadn't gotten their fingers all over the UI in the Maserati last year. iampwd One thing is for sure, I want that car. Oleg Vorkunov Google now worked much better than assistant. Now I want to throw my watch and phone away. leganzish Android Auto is as good as dead. It barely got more functional since its introduction and will only languish more now that Google has moved on. The thing I don't like is the car being data independent. That's the beauty of the "projection" method of Android Auto. I don't want to live in a future where I have a data connection for my phone, my tablet, my watch, my car, my refrigerator, my washer, and my dryer. I want a data connection for my phone and everything else to be able to piggy-back off of that. whispy_snippet I really doubt it's dead. What about the millions of people who don't intend to buy a car for years or have just bought a car with Android Auto? The majority of people sit in this category. Sure, "Automotive" is probably the future. But I think Android Auto has plenty more to come. leganzish I'm not saying its going to disappear of the face of the earth tomorrow. Just that it will languish. It has already had fairly slow adoption. I would expect adoption rates to slow now that Google has tipped their hand on the next automotive initiative. If consumers get frustrated at the Hangouts situation, I think the very careful/conservative (when it comes to tech progress) automotive brands will be extremely hesitant to invest in Android Auto when it appears to have fallen out of Google's favor. whispy_snippet Hmmm I'm still not convinced. For one, getting car makers to adopt Android Auto has been challenging enough. Convincing hundreds of car makers to suddenly drop their existing operating systems and hand full control to Google is going to take a lot of persuasion and a lot of time. In the short to mid term it's going to be easier to convince car makers to offer a "plug and play" connectivity feature that consumers demand, without the need to cede full control to Google. Remember, a lot of people use iPhones and will demand Apple CarPlay in their next vehicle. Do you think Apple is going to develop a CarPlay app for Android Automotive? I've no doubt Android Automotive is what Google sees as the end goal. But developing a full featured car OS from the ground up, for every single car maker, is an enormous task. In the meantime there are millions and millions of car owners out there with no intention of buying a new vehicle for years. Google has recognised this and its why Android Auto can now run as a stand alone app on phones. And because this app can run on millions of phones, it offers developers plenty of incentive to support it (and thus support Android Auto as a platform broadly). Filipe Santos Car Assistant first, Waze last JasonIvers Android Automotive is still better than some proprietary junk infotainment system from a car manufacturer, even if it's never updated at all. At least you have a reasonably good chance third-party developers will actually build something for it without having to be paid to do so. whispy_snippet My biggest worry about our new world of connected cars is security. Just wait until someone hacks a vehicle's control inputs and causes a crash. What are Google, Apple, car manufacturers, etc going to do about this looming question? abqnm I think that would come down to car manufacturers hardening and isolating essential control systems so they can't be accessed in the event the infotainment system is hacked and somehow allows access to the CAN-BUS. Still, even with access to CAN-BUS, proprietary software over encrypted connections is generally required to access control systems. So it's not like someone can just hack the infotainment system and suddenly can control your steering remotely. There would be a massive amount of protocol reverse-engineering work needed, and it would be on a per-model, per-software build, per-control surface basis. The Jeep exploit that was demoed a couple years back required them to reverse engineer and spend many hundreds of hours to do so. It's a concern, sure, but not a major one. whispy_snippet If a car being hacked could result in someone's death then I would consider it a major concern. The reputation of connected cars and their associated manufacturers and developers are at stake. Just one death as a result of a car being hacked could ripple through the media and cause millions to question the safety of something like Android Automotive. I obviously don't understand how one would hack a car and I'm sure it's ridiculously complex. But if it's possible, I really hope the companies that have our lives in their hands are doing everything they can to mitigate a disaster. It might sound dramatic, but I think it's really important to keep asking these questions. Software exploits are rare, but every now and again we see even the big companies drop the ball (Apple with its iCloud brute force hack, Google with its Google Docs exploit, Microsoft and the ransomware attack). If computers and software are vulnerable, that makes cars with computers and software vulnerable. And when you're hurtling along at 60mph that's well worth our concern. abqnm Since it relies on assistant, does that mean that all cars must now have a data connection? Does or can it use the phone's data connection? There was no indication of connection sharing in the Volvo demo. I really don't want to see cars that I have to pay a monthly subscription fee for a data connection just to be able to tell it to turn off my seat heater. RyanWhitwam The demo cars both had dedicated LTE. That's the way it works right now. Presumably, it would be possible to share the data connection, but that would be up to automakers. whispy_snippet Surely a wireless charging pad with NFC that triggers a WiFi tether arrangement makes sense. Every phone in the near future and onward is going to have wireless charging - we just need an agreed standard of course... ekngee i think Android Automotive is more of a motive-ational push to say "hey, it's easy to use Android to build your infotainment system, rather than do your own from scratch". Android Auto should still stay, because as stated, updates are a big unknown, so i'd rather be safe updating my phone than the car. SAM Few years down the road, people will be talking about android fragmentation on cars, how only 1% of cars are on latest Android version and Android O still wont die.

The event was at the Marin Art and Garden Center and featured a fascinating conversation between the two beautiful blondes. The Representation Project’s goal is to create a world free of social injustices and gender stereotypes—they seek to represent everyone no matter their race, sex, religion, and background. Through documentary films, such as Miss Representation and The Mask You Live In, Siebel Newsom and her team are breaking down barriers and putting a spotlight on the narratives that limit boys and girls from reaching their full potential. At the breakfast, Siebel Newsom interviewed Mayer with questions that focused on being a working mother in a position of power. Mayer shared many interesting details from her pregnancy and early days of motherhood with the crowd, who enjoyed coffee, herb-crusted frittata, and fresh fruit with yogurt while listening to the chat. Marissa Mayer and Jennifer Siebel Newsom Photo Credit: Drew Altizer Mayer explained her reasoning behind her short maternity leaves. She took two weeks off when her first child, son Macallister, was born in 2012, and only took off five days when her twins, daughters Marielle and Sylvana, were born in late 2015. “I was recruited to Yahoo when I was six months pregnant. I was sort of lucky that I didn’t show until very late and so I hadn’t really told anyone, so people didn’t know that I was six months pregnant when I was interviewing,” Mayer said. “I had been planning a pretty glorious six month maternity leave at Google. Google has really very friendly maternity policies, but that changed because Yahoo wasn’t in the state in 2012 where the CEO could take maternity leave, frankly at all. I sort of knew, based on my own observations, especially when I started at the company, that there was not going to be the opportunity to be gone for very long at all.” She converted a closet into a sound-proof room for baby Macallister and took him to work with her every morning. Both women called for more empathy toward other moms and less judgement of how women approach their motherhood. “Everyone makes it work in a way that they need to. Everyone does it in their own way,” Mayer said. “I think there is too much judgment involved from other women and I think you have to have respect for everyone and the fact that they are going to do it their own way.” They also talked about how men need to step up and meet their wives more than half way. Mayer’s husband, Zachery Bogue, is a champion of the outdoors and is often bringing the kids on nature walks and other open air adventures. The Representation Project team Photo Credit: Drew Altizer One of the most riveting details that Mayer shared was her blindness to gender biases. She didn’t realize that she was the only girl in the math and science classes until her last year at Stanford when she had an epiphany while reading an article in the school newspaper about campus icons. The story “defined campus icons as people, that you might not know their names, but you know them by description. Like the guy with the sandwich board in White Plaza, that always yelled when you passed him,” she remembered. “I was reading through the list and kind of chuckling about it and he was like, ‘Oh, I know that one, I know that one, I know that one,’ and then there was literally a bullet point in there that said, the blonde woman in the upper division computer science classes. I thought, ‘I should totally know this.’ Oh my gosh, it was me. Up until I read that article, I had never realized that I was the only woman, or the only blonde. I guess I was not clueless, but I was 21, 22 years old before I realized that I was the only person of that description.” She believes that women should not focus on the separations, but instead simply get the job done. The garden setting Photo Credit: Drew Altizer Another fun tidbit? A story from her early days at Google. Larry Page and Sergey Brin respected Mayer’s opinion so much that they made sure to have a women interview every candidate that Google hired. Brin “did this interesting thing that helped Google I think, to this day,” Mayer said. “He said, ‘look, you might only wanna hire a lot of women into Google. But we want to hire men who are good at working with women. We want to make sure that every man coming in to Google, especially on the technical side, knows how to work with technical women. Doesn’t interrupt them, doesn’t talk over them, in terms of what we do, speak to them well.’ I think that really helped overall build a culture, in particular with Google. It was very welcoming not only of women, but of men who are really collaborative and respond to those gender lines.” Anja Manuel, Zem Joaquin and Jennifer Siebel Newsom Photo Credit: Drew Altizer Other topics included wage equality, better computer science education, the internet’s sometimes negative portrayal of public figures, and how to ask for a promotion. Mayer says women should ask for raises, but in a way that is more about doing a better job than it is about getting more money. “To me it’s about what’s the work, how do you get there, how do you get to that next level, how do you get a bigger role. Ask what will it take for me to head up? What kind of time frame would you be looking at to make that decision?” Mayer said. “Did I ask that every week, of my boss? No, but did I have that conversation like, once or twice year? Yes. Everyone should be having a conversation once or twice a year that discusses how can they achieve their potential.” The chat concluded with Siebel Newsom thanking her friend for being a “talented and courageous leader and a role model and inspiration to me and so many of us and to young girls.” Notable attendees in the crowd were Zem Joaquin, Sabrina Buell, Nate Ballard, and Anja Manuel.

Now in its second developer preview, Android O brings a number of performance improvements and new features. While many of these may just be small tweaks, collectively, they’ll make Android a lot more pleasant to use on the whole. We’ll keep this post updated as new features are discovered and announced in versions of Android to come. If you have a recent Nexus or Pixel device, you can try out Android O for yourself by signing up for the beta program. The usual caveat applies: this is beta software that could very well crash more often and be slower than a stable build. Install at your own risk. Picture-in-picture video Android is getting proper support for picture-in-picture video – essentially a floating video window that will help make sure you never get any work done. PiP as seen on Android TV Though some manufacturers like Samsung have already added this feature, the feature is normally limited to just a few apps. Official Google support means much wider compatibility to come – and hopefully less performance overhead as well. A bunch of notification improvements Android O is changing notifications in a number of important ways, so we’ve grouped the most notable ones together: You can Snooze notifications and have them appear at a later time so you can focus on the task at hand without forgetting whatever you’re getting notified about. Notification channels allow developers to essentially have different notification categories within their apps. For example, in a news app, users could choose to only receive notifications on specific topics. Users can also modify properties such as alert tones, priority and whether notifications show up on your lock screen for each notification channel. Developers can set background colors to help differentiate their notifications from the crowd. Notification badges/dots are exactly what they sound like, a little badge telling you there are unread notifications in a particular app. Unlike iOS, however, Android O doesn’t tell you how many unread notifications you have – only that you have them. Instead, you can long-press on an app icon to view your unread notifications. Thankfully, you can also turn off the feature altogether if, like me, you find notification badges to be more distraction than they’re worth. Messaging notifications can now show more text before you need to enter an app. Android Go Android Go is Google’s new Android fork that promises smoother performance and lower data usage on affordable devices, particularly in developing nations. It’s basically a lighter version of Android O with several optimizations to the kernel and Google’s native Android apps. It also emphasizes power-optimized apps in the Play Store. Android Go will be the default OS for any device with 1GB of RAM or less, though it’s possible we’ll see it appear on devices with more memory in the future. Speed and power improvements As with every version of Android, Google is touting speed and battery improvements with Android O: Google is claiming much faster boot times. The Google Pixel, specifically, can boot twice as fast in O over Nougat. New Background execution limits mean Google is cracking down on apps that abuse their ability to run in the background. Before you worry that Android is becoming iOS, Google is providing alternate means for developers to run background tasks with less performance overhead. This should help improve battery life too. New Emoji Android O is introducing a dramatic overhaul to Emoji – for better or for worse. Gone are the iconic gumdrop blobs, replaced by quasi-circular emoji that are closer to the graphics used by other platforms. Credit: Emojipedia If you ask me, that makes Android lose some of its charm, but at least it will help avoid the confusion caused by some Google emoji looking completely different to the ones on other devices. The redesign also includes all-new emoji – including a bearded person, hijab-clad woman, breastfeeding, dinosaurs, and more – as part of the upcoming release of Emoji 5.0 (part of Unicode 10). You can view the full list of Emoji on Emojipedia. Machine Learning Copy and Paste You’d think copy and paste is a simple enough feature that it doesn’t need updating, but Google’s found a way to improve it with machine learning. Basically, Android O will be clever enough to recognize exactly what you might want to copy and paste with a touch. The company has noticed that most of what people copy and paste are things like business names and addresses, so rather than clumsily selecting tiny text with a couple of cursor knobs, Android’s AI will automatically select what it thinks you’re trying to get at. Of course, you can always modify your selection later, but it should make things go a bit faster. Moreover, Android is smart enough to recognize what kind of selection it is. If you’re copying an address, a floating toolbar will suggest a shortcut to paste the location directly into Google maps. More fingerprint gestures Android O’s developer documentation explains that accessibility services will be able to respond to directional swipes on the fingerprint sensor. While it seems to be meant for accessibility apps, we’re likely to see some apps take advantage of it for custom gestures. Autofill within apps Using autofill on the Web is second nature to save some time inputting things like credit card numbers and addresses, but that doesn’t help you if you need to input this within an app. Android O introduces an Autofill Framework that should solve this issue. It also seems users can set specific apps to manage how forms are filled. Adaptive Icons Icons on Android O can be designed to support a variety of shapes – including squares, circles, and squircles – which should help deal with the style discrepancies among various manufacturers. This is done by giving icons two layers – a background and foreground – so that only the background gets cut off depending on the manufacturer. The two layers also allow for sleeker animation effects, like a pulse, bounce, or parallax. Kotlin Support Google announced native support for the Kotlin programming language at I/O, and developers rejoiced. It’s a relatively young language that is meant to deal with some of Java’s annoyances. Several apps have been using Kotlin code in a patchwork of sorts, but this is the first time you can natively develop Android apps from start to finish with Kotlin. That should hopefully result in more stable code, faster fixes, and a lower threshold for new developers as Kotlin surely moves towards becoming the dominant language for Android in the years to come. Proper color management One of the more subtle reasons macOS and iOS have been so popular with visual artists is that Apple takes color management seriously. Android O brings proper support for wide-gamut displays and media thanks to native support for color profiles like AdobeRGB, DCI-P3 and more. This should also help colors remain a bit more consistent across devices, and allow Android to finally take full advantage of the many wonderful displays out there. Multi-Display Support Android O improved multi-display support substantially, by allowing you to move apps from one panel to another. Apps can specify which display an activity should run on. There aren’t too many scenarios where you’ll use an Android device in a multi-display setup, but it will come in handy from time to time, especially if you use a tablet with a keyboard like the Pixel C. Android TV gets its first major launcher redesign Android TV has pretty much looked the same since it first launched, but in O it’s been significantly redesigned to make it easier to get to the content you want to watch. The idea is that you have different ‘channels’ represented as rows in the launcher. By default there is a row for launching your various apps, and an AI-powered ‘Watch Next’ row that picks out specific shows and videos you might want to watch. Beyond that, apps can create individual channels within the homescreen featuring specific content, with the user’s permission. All this means you should be able to get you your shows more quickly, without having to enter and search within individual apps. Bluetooth 5 Support Android O brings full support for the Bluetooth 5.0 spec. Keep in mind, this is just on the software end, and both your smartphone/tablet and your paired device will need the proper hardware for Bluetooth 5 to work (the Galaxy S8 is currently the only phone with Bluetooth 5). Still, if all those pre-requisites are met, there are plenty of benefits, including twice the transfer speed and four times the range of its predecessor. Perhaps the most practical advantage, however, is the ability to connect two pairs of headphones at once for listening to music with friends. It’s about time. Wi-Fi Aware could make local multiplayer a breeze Wi-Fi Aware allows devices to easily communicate without an internet connection or even being connected to the same access point/router. Nor would you have to turn on Wi-Fi manually. It literally means your device is aware of other nearby devices, somewhat like StreetPass on the Nintendo 3DS. It could make local multiplayer a lot easier to set up on Android, as you wouldn’t have to go through complicated pairing procedures or laggy internet connections. That being said, Wi-Fi Aware needs special hardware support, which Google says it’s working with manufacturers to establish. Turn on Wi-Fi automatically when you get home One of my favorite little announcements from Google I/O was the ability for Android O to turn Wi-Fi on automatically when you arrive to trusted locations, If you tend to turn Wi-Fi off when you’re out and about to conserve battery, this will make your life a lot easier. It’ll also save you precious data should you forget to turn it back on when you get home. Any major features we missed?

Menu News Comment Science Features Culture Film & TV Music Fashion Theatre Sport Violet Write for us Tuesday 23rd May 2017 | Cambridge, UK Menu News Comment Science Features Culture Film & TV Music Fashion Theatre Sport Violet Write for us I google, therefore I am Google and Facebook’s attempts to turn our complex identities into single, easily-accessible profiles are ultimately harmful practices, writes columnist Sam Brown We concede an alarming amount of our personal information to websites and online applications, failing to fully consider how this may be used against us.Jason Howie by Sam Brown Monday May 22 2017, 11:30pm Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on Pinterest Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Imagine you are walking down the street. Someone inconspicuously taps you on the shoulder. They then proceed to outline their conception of your ‘personality’, listing your achievements, character-traits, quirks, wants, and needs. However strange this image may seem in a real-world context, this is your relationship with the internet – a singular ‘profile’ that is compiled through detailed analysis of your search and purchase history, Facebook ‘friends’, and messages. On the internet, you are no longer multifaceted, you are simply an ‘identity’. It was in 2010 that Mark Zuckerberg notoriously proclaimed that “Having two identities for yourself is an example of a lack of integrity.” It was through this logic that he advocated the notion of having a single, all-encompassing internet ‘identity’, that combined all elements of your personality into one accessible profile. It may not surprise you to learn that Zuckerberg’s motives for this line of argument are financially driven. By simplifying users into units of data, social media megaliths like Google and Facebook can pass your profile on to advertising companies throughout the world, allowing your internet browsing experience to be tailored specifically to your supposed material desires. It is for this reason that Google has increasingly pushed for users to have a single ‘Account ID’ that spans over all of its applications. Thanks to this, they can now ground their advertising in information from your Gmail, Google Photos, Drive, YouTube searches, and Google search history, alongside data from the now well-known ‘Cookies’ feature. It takes no expert to state that an alarming amount of our personal information remains up for grabs on the internet. The dangers of this were thrown into sharp relief when, on 17 April this year, an Indian hacker group leaked the data of 1.7 million Snapchat users on the internet. Companies like Google can draw on a wealth of this data when constructing your ‘internet identity’. Google itself provides several tools for users to visualise how the company has built up a sense of their personality: Google Dashboard and its ‘account activity report’ are two examples. These services provide us with a fantastic means of testing how much companies like Google know about us. A look at my own Google Dashboard provides an example of how much information you can unconsciously give to websites while browsing. “It is a long held myth that when you share details with an online company or website you are sharing with them alone.” The investigation begins well: Google has correctly surmised I am indeed a male within the 18-24 age bracket. However, it is perhaps comforting to note how, beyond this, my Google personality is somewhat flimsier. Among the supposed ‘topics I like’, ‘condos and townhouses’ and ‘folk and traditional music’ are highflyers, suggesting I clearly have a repressed desire to purchase urban property whilst listening to Kacey Musgraves. Equally questionable is my ‘interest’ in ‘parenting’ – to my knowledge, this is not something I should be concerned with. In turn, my internet search activity provides a damning indictment of my otherwise prestigious English degree: ‘SparkNotes’ features embarrassingly high up the list. Any similar investigation into your own internet identity will uncover that it is impossible to truly represent your identity in one online profile. Rather, we as humans are multifaceted and only bring out various parts of our identity when we are in the appropriate social context. The internet prevents us from having control over when we reveal a facet to the world. An example of this is when employers view your Facebook profile before a job interview, making a prejudgement about your personality based on pictures of drunken Cindies nights or post-ironic revels at Turf. Such a practise is so prevalent among companies that former CEO of Google Eric Schmidt once suggested young people should change their profile names upon reaching adulthood to escape their cyber-past. He told the Wall Street Journal: “I don’t believe society understands what happens when everything is available, knowable and recorded by everyone all the time.” Perhaps a more serious consequence of the ‘single online persona’ model advocated by Google and Facebook is that it becomes very hard to verify, maintain, and control identity information, especially when these companies lack real regulation. In 2016, for instance, it emerged that a number of UK-based paedophile rings were using secret groups on Facebook to post and swap obscene images of children. Facebook settings meant the groups were not visible to the majority of users and only members could view the images. Facebook’s regulatory measures were clearly not strong enough to deal with these types of criminal practises. This extreme example suggests that when a company collates your information into a singular profile they also take on a responsibility for the monitoring of this information for signs of criminal activity. The selfish meme It is a long held myth that when you share details with an online company or website you are sharing with them alone. With Google and Facebook increasingly interconnecting their various services with new applications and advertising companies, a decision to entrust your details with one website is in fact a decision to share information with a wide net of websites. Your internet identity is becoming further and further distanced from reality, and internet companies exploit the simplification of complex ‘personalities’ into one-sided ‘profiles’ to marketise your internet experience. Noam Chomsky was one of the first to realise this: “The internet’s corporate owners want it to be a technique of control.” In this increasingly interconnected world, maintaining control over your internet identity has become more important than ever Most read Latest stories News / Caius appoints its first female Master 21 May 2017 Features / Black and queer: sex, love and identity formation 19 May 2017 Violet / New voting website teaches students how to rig the general election 21 May 2017 Features / Plane stupid: how I voluntarily spent 14 hours at Stansted airport 20 May 2017 News / Leaked email shows contradictions in CUSU publication claims 21 May 2017 Features / I google, therefore I am 22 May 2017 Music / Review: Harry Styles – Harry Styles 22 May 2017 Violet / Thread Flair: May Week Spirit Animals 22 May 2017 Violet / Big Mouth: In Defence of New Writing 22 May 2017 Sport / Premier League title caps unprecedented season for Fitz football 22 May 2017 Sponsored links Limo hire Microsoft Research Back to top First published in 1947, Varsity is the independent student newspaper for the University of Cambridge.

There were a range of new features announced that look to improve the user experience, so what does Apple need to offer with iOS 11 to compete? We’ve outlined some of the key new additions to Android O, along with features that Apple should implement into iOS 11 to compete. Read next: iOS vs Android What’s new in Android O? So, what does Android O bring to the table? While none are ground-breaking features, Android O brings a handful of useful changes to Google’s operating system. Picture-in-Picture One of the announcements made at Google I/O 2017 was the addition of picture-in-picture, a feature already used not only in Google’s YouTube app, but also in iOS. Picture-in-Picture was introduced for iPad users along with iOS 9, allowing users to minimise the video and perform other tasks while still being able to watch. Google O’s implementation of picture-in-picture works much the same as it does on iOS; with a video playing, Android users need only tap the Home button and the video will pop into a small window that remains on-screen while you use other apps. You can slide the video around for the best placement or swipe it off-screen to end the video. Notification Dots While users of custom Android launchers have had access to notification badges for years, Google has never officially offered it – until now. Much like with app badges on iOS, you’ll see a small ‘dot’ that appears on top of your app icon when you receive a notification on Android O. What is different to iOS is what you can do with it; as well as being able to tap on the app to open it and interact with the notification, you can also long-press the icon to get a short list of actions to perform. This includes the ability to view the notification without opening the app via a small on-screen pop-up that looks like the 3D Touch shortcut menu on iOS, but more notification-based. Smart Text Selection Basic text selection tools have been around for quite some time and have largely remained unchanged. More recent iterations of Android and iOS have introduced formatting to applicable text, but not much else. That was until Google announced Smart Text Selection, which uses Google’s AI to intelligently analyse what is being selected, and provides you with contextual shortcuts. Say, for example, you highlight a phone number – it’ll offer you a shortcut to dial the number. Similarly, highlighting an address will provide a shortcut to begin navigation using Google Maps. It’s not just smart suggestions either, as the highlighting process will also be more intelligent, selecting full phrases and addresses instead of single words. Auto-Fill Android O isn’t about one headline feature, instead it’s about addressing a number of smaller issues within the operating system. One such addition is Auto-Fill. It’s not going to bring iOS users over to the dark side, but it should make Android users lives a little bit easier. For the most used apps on your Android device, Android O will help you quickly log in. Although support needs to be manually added by developers, once supported, Android O will remember usernames and passwords to quickly log into apps on your device. Vitals Vitals isn’t one feature, but is instead a suite of tools that helps to improve the performance and security of your Android device. It includes Google Play Protect, which acts similarly to a virus scanner for Android apps and scans your apps for malicious content. It also includes Wise Limits, which prevents apps from running in the background for too long and helps to make your battery last longer. Google claims that the improvements have halved the boot time of the company’s Pixel smartphone, and that apps run faster too. Read more: iPhone 7 Plus vs Google Pixel XL | iPhone 7 vs Google Pixel Tidier UI As well as the above features (and a long list of tiny tweaks), Android O presents a cleaner version of Android – especially in the Notification Shade and Settings app. Although there aren’t dramatic differences in what’s on offer, it’s often the smaller changes that are most appreciated (like when Apple changed the font in iOS 9). What does Apple need to offer in iOS 11 to compete with Android O? While Apple isn’t showcasing iOS 11 until WWDC in June 2017, here’s what we think iOS 11 needs to offer in order to compete with Google’s Android O. Improvements to the Notification Center The Notification Center was originally introduced alongside iOS 5, although what was initially introduced is worlds away with what is on offer in iOS 10, including the Today view with third-party Widgets. While it has seen improvements year-on-year, we feel like it could use a bit of an upgrade, namely with the way that it handles notifications. Notifications in iOS 10 are a mess. While you used to have the ability to group (and clear) notifications based on app, iOS 10 removed the option. Instead, you can only sort notifications by newest first, meaning those that receive many notifications (from games, social networks, etc) may miss important text messages or emails. Compare this to the Notification Shade in Android O: it’s clean, and the notifications are automatically grouped by app. You can split the group notification into single notifications to interact with a specific one, or you can clear them all with a single swipe. It’s so simple and intuitive, and it’s something that Apple fans are calling for in iOS 11. UI improvements – or at least the fabled Dark Mode iOS hasn’t seen a major redesign since iOS 7, which introduced Apple’s mobile system to a world of bold shapes and colours. While Apple’s operating system doesn’t necessarily look ugly, it has looked essentially the same since 2013, and some argue that it’s due for another facelift. Couple that with the fact that the iPhone is 10 years old this year, and we think Apple could be planning something big. If it’s not an overhaul of the look and feel of iOS, we imagine Apple will finally announce the fabled Dark Mode, a feature rumoured to be coming to iOS soon. Ability to change default apps The main argument in the iOS vs Android war is “Android allows for more customisation than iOS” and for the most part, that’s true. Android users can change the launcher of their smartphones, allowing for a completely different look to what Google envisioned. It’s not just in terms of visuals either: Android users can select different default apps, they aren’t locked into the default Google apps like iOS users are with Apple’s first-party apps like Maps and Mail. When an iOS user clicks on an email address in Safari, it’ll open in Mail and there’s nothing they can do about it. It’s a similar story with addresses – it’ll open Apple Maps, even if you use Google Maps or Waze more often. While we don’t want Android-esque launchers to be available in iOS 11, we’d love the ability to change the default apps that open. Because, let’s be honest Apple, nobody really uses the default Mail app. Augmented reality capabilities Okay, we admit this one is more of a ‘blue sky’ idea, but it’s worth mentioning. There are plenty of rumours floating around the internet at the moment that suggest Apple is interested in augmented reality, and is looking to implement the technology into iPhones sooner rather than later. With this being said, we envision an AR camera app being launched alongside iOS 11. Separate from the Camera app that is used to take photos and videos, the AR-focused Camera app would allow users to interact with their environment using AR, whether it be in the form of filters, navigation or getting more information on a product or place. The AR apps would work in a similar way to iMessage apps introduced in iOS 10: it would be its own platform with a range of apps to use specifically within the AR Camera app. At the very least, it should open the world of augmented reality to traditional smartphone app developers, and could serve as the building blocks for Apple’s AR glasses (if/when they ever appear).   Read next: How private is your iPhone data, and how to protect your privacy OUR VERDICT Android O offers decent improvements to the Android experience, but we'll have to wait and see what Apple announces at WWDC 2017 before we deliver any kind of verdict.

London pulled together in exactly the same way that Manchester is its own unique way will pull together. We will stand strong, and stand together, that’s what we are. That’s what we do. So they won’t win. We are grieving, we are hurt today, but as I said we are strong. And this city has dealt with difficult days in the past and we do so now. Burnham also confirmed that he will be taking part in the government’s emergency Cobra meeting via video link from Manchester. He said: “I will be heading over to Greater Manchester Police Force headquarters after this press call to take part in the Cobra meeting alongside the police constable. There will be a further update after that.

Greater Manchester police say the perpetrator was a man acting alone, who died at the scene after detonating an improvised explosive device. Investigators are trying to establish whether the bomber was part of a wider network. The blast took place outside the arena, in the public foyer, shortly after 10.30pm, minutes after the concert ended. No identities of those killed or injured have been confirmed. No arrests have been made. The wounded are receiving treatment in eight hospitals across Greater Manchester. The prime minister, Theresa May, will chair a meeting of the government’s emergency Cobra committee at 9am today. In an overnight statement, May said: We are working to establish the full details of what is being treated by the police as an appalling terrorist attack. All our thoughts are with the victims and the families of those who have been affected. Emergency services at the scene of the explosion. Photograph: SilverHub/REX/Shutterstock Party leaders Jeremy Corbyn, Nicola Sturgeon, Tim Farron, Leanne Wood and Paul Nuttall also expressed condolences. Campaigning for June’s general election has been suspended. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham called it “an evil act” that would not succeed in breaking the spirit of the city. Ariana Grande, who was not hurt in the explosion, tweeted that she was: “broken. From the bottom of my heart, I am so so sorry. I don’t have words.” A large area around the arena has been cordoned off. Victoria station has been closed and train services cancelled for the whole of Tuesday. Police have asked people to stay away from the area. British Transport Police said extra officers, some armed, would be on patrol today. Greater Manchester police has set up a hotline for those concerned about relatives or friends who might have been caught up in the Manchester explosion: 0161 856 9400.

For others the terror was all too immediately apparent. The lights had just come on and Ariana Grande had left the stage after concluding an elaborate three-hour, four-part entertainment extravaganza with an encore performance of her latest single, Dangerous Woman. At 10.30pm following a sold-out show in the 21,000-capacity Manchester Arena, thousands of fans began to gather up their belongings and filter slowly out of four exits. Then the bang. For the first milliseconds, minds did not immediately connect the sound with an explosion or a bomb. “It sounded like a big balloon popping, but it was kind of muffled, like it wasn’t in the stadium itself,” said a young Mancunian fan, identified as Sammy, in a video he recorded of his experience and posted on Periscope. “There were a few screams, then there was silence. Then the whole arena literally split like the Red Sea – everyone was trampling over each other, sprinting to get to the nearest exit.

She’d just seen the support act and said she was having an amazing time, and thanking me for letting her go. She was with her friend, Adam. Adam was found about half an hour ago – he’s in hospital – but Olivia’s not been found yet. I’m at home phoning everybody: hospitals, police, the centres that the children have been put in.

I’ve got people I don’t even know looking for her, people messaging me, saying we’ve got her photo, looking for her, we’ll get in contact if we see her. And I’m just hearing nothing. Her phone’s dead. Social media has been wonderful. I don’t know what I’ve have done without them, it’s made it so aware that she’s missing. There’s thousands of people who now know she’s missing, there’s people out looking for her I don’t know, and I can’t thank these people enough, giving their time up.

Updated at 2.19am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.15am EDT 02:15 Police: full statement Chief constable Ian Hopkins confirms that 22 people have died and a further 59 have been injured. This has been the most horrific incident we have had to face in Greater Manchester and one that we all hoped we would never see. Families and many young people were out to enjoy a concert at the Manchester Arena and have lost their lives. Our thoughts are with those 22 victims that we now know have died, the 59 people who have been injured and their loved ones. We continue to do all we can to support them. They are being treated at eight hospitals across Greater Manchester. This is a fast-moving investigation and we have significant resources deployed to both the investigation and the visible patrols that people will see across Greater Manchester as they wake up to news of the events last night. This will include armed officers as people would expect. More than 400 officers have been involved in the operation during the night. To remind you, we were called at 10.33pm to reports of an explosion at the Manchester Arena at the conclusion of an Ariana Grande concert. More than 250 calls came in and emergency services were very quickly on scene. Emergency numbers have been established for anyone who is concerned for loved ones who may not have returned home: 0161 856 9400 or 0161 856 9900. We have been treating this as a terrorist incident and we believe that while the attack last night was conducted by one man. The priority is to establish whether he was acting alone or as part of a network. The attacker, I can confirm, died at the arena. We believe the attacker was carrying an improvised explosive device, which he detonated, causing this atrocity. We would ask people not to speculate on his details or to share names. There is a complex and wide-ranging investigation under way. Our priority is to work with the national counter-terrorist policing network and UK intelligence services to establish more details about the individual who carried out this attack.

Here’s​ our experience so far Trending in Google Hands on with the new features in Android O Dev Preview 2 [Video] Trending in Google Review: Huawei Watch 2 loses the charm of its predecessor [Video] Trending in Google How to install & run Google Assistant on your Mac or PC desktop [Video] Trending in Google Best Android smartwatches you can buy [May 2017] Trending in Google Best Android phones you can buy [May 2017] Yesterday GOOG: 941.86 7.85 Hangouts for Android loses SMS support today, these are the best alternatives Ben Schoon - May. 22nd 2017 3:02 pm PT @NexusBen Apps & Updates Android View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Hangouts was once Google’s go-to platform for all things messaging, but now, the company seems to announce another new messaging platform every few months. As Google shifts Hangouts to the enterprise and focuses in on other options for consumers, the company is pulling out another component of Hangouts — SMS support. The best gifts for Android users SMS support for Google Hangouts on Android officially ends today. This shouldn’t come as a surprise, though, as we’ve known this was coming for a while now. While Project Fi subscribers will still have access to the feature, everyone else will lose it today. While we’re sad to see it go, it does make sense given that not everyone was a fan of the feature, Google does support alternate SMS clients, and that Hangouts will soon be shifted over to Hangouts Chat. To be clear, though, Google Voice integration isn’t being cut off just yet. However, many fell in love with the feature, and replacing it is not going to be an easy task. If you’re among that crowd and need another option to move to, a couple of solutions are listed below. Simple and Functional – Android Messages Formerly known as Messenger, Google’s official SMS client for Android is a fantastic app that works really well. As far as messaging clients go it’s very basic, but it gets the job done for SMS and even supports RCS messaging if your carrier supports the feature. – Download on Google Play Cross-Platform SMS – Pulse Messenger If your favorite feature of Hangouts was support for chatting not just on a phone, but also on a PC, then this next option is for you. Pulse Messenger is developed by the same team as the popular Talon Twitter client, and it’s just as awesome. The app in itself is a simple, but excellent SMS client that has extensive theming capabilities and a great design, but its true power is in sync. Through an affordable subscription, you can easily keep tabs on your SMS from your phone, PC, tablet, or anything else that runs Android apps or Chrome. It even has an excellent Android Wear 2.0 app. – Download on Google Play SMS and Online Chatting – Facebook Messenger Now, I know what you’re thinking, replacing a Google app with one from Facebook?! Hear me out. One of the great things about the Hangouts platform is that you aren’t locked to phone numbers for messaging. Instead, you can talk to anyone with a Google account. Facebook offers the same functionality with Messenger along with SMS support. This won’t be the ideal solution for everyone, but it works. – Download on Google Play Obviously, none of these are ideal solutions for anyone invested in Hangouts, but they’re options. Personally, I’ve been using Hangouts solely for online chats and Pulse SMS as a dedicated SMS application, and I’ve been happy with the results, even if I’m still using two apps. Hopefully, Google will actually pay attention and integrate SMS into Allo… Ben Schoon @NexusBen Ben is a writer for 9to5Google who can also be found over on the 9to5Google YouTube channel and on Twitter @NexusBen.

Matt McGee on May 19, 2017 at 12:50 pm More The Google news was fast and furious this week, with numerous announcements coming from its annual developers’ conference, Google I/O 2017. The event is wrapping up today, so this week’s episode of Marketing Land Live offers a look back at some of the bigger announcements that will impact online marketers. Much of the focus was on Google Assistant, the company’s smart/virtual assistant that originally powered Google Home devices and has since expanded to Android phones and — as of this week — the iPhone, too. Google made a number of updates to Assistant’s capabilities, including an interesting tie-in with yet another new Google product called Google Lens. That’s an AI-powered visual search tool that turns your smartphone camera into a pretty powerful search box. We have audio explaining these new developments directly from Wednesday’s Google I/O keynote, featuring Google CEO Sundar Pichai, along with Scott Huffman and Rishi Chandra.

While there’s still no tvOS version of YouTube TV, Google’s new video service updated its iOS app today with support for Apple’s AirPlay feature on iOS. Sony A6500 AirPlay lets you send audio and video from an iPhone or iPad to an Apple TV on the same Wi-Fi network. It’s not as easy to use as just launching an app on an Apple TV, but it’s a workaround solution for YouTube TV subscribers for now. Amazon Prime Video subscribers have had to rely on this same method for years now, although Amazon may be planning to introduce an Apple TV app as soon as next month at WWDC.

It’s a phrase that links all of Google’s interface experiments. [Image: Google] By Mark Wilson4 minute Read On stage this week at I/O, Google’s biggest event of the year, the company repeatedly used a term we haven’t heard Google–or anyone else–use very often: “immersive computing.” advertisement It’s a phrase that Google is clearly trying to make happen, given its name-drops on stage and even as one panel title. Who knows if it will actually catch on the way “internet of things” did, but immersive computing is still a useful term. In short, it’s Google’s explanation of what the heck it’s doing with its most experimental user interfaces–virtual reality, augmented reality, and all that tough-to-describe stuff in between. Google Daydream. [Photo: Google] What Is Immersive Computing? At I/O, Google’s head of VR, Clay Bavor, began by running through all of Google’s seemingly disparate initiatives relating to interfaces that live on your face, from the holographic dressing rooms of Project Tango, to the video games of Daydream, to the virtual museums of Cardboard. “You’ve seen a bunch of different projects . . . we’re doing some work in AR, some work in VR. What’s going on here?” he asked. “To us these terms don’t represent two separate and distinct things. They’re just labels for two pits on a spectrum we call the immersive computing spectrum.” Then he showed this chart: [Image: Google]On one end of the human experience, you have reality. Living, breathing, non-digital reality. It’s great. Usually. In the middle, as technology becomes more “immersive,” you have augmented reality. Basically, graphics start to float in front of your eyes on top of the real world–like a monster in Pokémon Go. Then, eventually, as more and more of these graphics are layered over your perception, you naturally segue into virtual reality. At the right end of the spectrum, all reality has been replaced with pixels. Google Lens. [Image: Google] Why Is It A Big Deal? Think of it this way: Google was taking this moment to get designers, developers, users, and the rest of the world on the same page, and addressing one of the biggest misconceptions about the future of computing. advertisement Often, people group VR experiences–like what you might have on an HTC Vive or Oculus Rift–into a completely distinct category from AR experiences, which you might have using Microsoft Hololens, Google Tango, or your own smartphone (or even Google Lens–the exciting AR search tool Google just announced, which you can read about here). Google is saying that these aren’t really distinct experiences or technological paradigms, as the products of today may make it appear. They’re all a gradient.  Google Tango’s room-mapping tech. [Image: Google]For now, Google’s hardware, like Daydream VR and Tango AR, are distinct products. But it’s safe to say that won’t be the case for long. Last year, Bavor told me that virtual reality and augmented reality would merge, and soon. Think more like 1 or 2 years away, not 5 or 10.  For proof, look to the new VR headset Google announced at I/O this week. Unlike all other headsets on the market today, this new device doesn’t require a phone, PC, or anything else to work. It has no wires, and needs no gadgets or sensors set up nearby to track you. You could use it anywhere, and theoretically walk with it (though Google has built in some safeguards for user safety). I see it as a step toward the merging of AR and VR, where a single headset could operate either as an immersive virtual experience, or a hybrid interface overlaid on your real life. How is a wireless, go-anywhere VR headset even technically possible? It has what Google calls “inside out positioning.” Standalone Daydream headsets from Vive (L) and Lenovo (R). [Image: Google] Another New Term? Yes. Another term. “Inside out” means that, rather than using all sorts of external sensors, laser beams, and other crap to track your position the way most headsets do today, this new headset (filled with chips from Qualcomm, and loaded with some Google software) lets you move and see in every direction with no external gadgets, using a mix of accelerometers and a camera. You’ll even be able to get turn-by-turn directions indoors. advertisement But all you need to know is that “inside out” technology could bring about VR’s long-awaited iPhone moment. It enables a totally standalone device that doesn’t require a PC and won’t ruin your living room with wires and sensors, but still gives you the most “immersive” VR experience possible. A Tango powered holographic Gap dressing room. [Image: Google] But Aren’t You Still Talking About Virtual Reality? Well, not exactly. Imagine putting on a headset. You’re in a virtual reality office. Now run your finger across a slider on your temple. The digital walls and chairs fade away. Now, you can clearly see, you’ve actually been sitting on the very real beach all along. And in front of you, there’s a virtual monitor floating in your view. In short, immersive computing will let you can pick and choose how much reality you want at any time. That’s the sort of vision Google is talking about. It’s the ability to dive as deeply (or shallowly) into the digital world as you like, at any time you would like, through glasses, or goggles, or a screen, or contact lenses. Immersive computing is Google’s play to hack your perception at a moment’s notice. “From our present vantage point, it can be hard to clearly see how this all unfolds. What is clear, though, is that it will unfold,” said Bavor in a recent Medium post on immersive computing. “One day, we’ll wonder how we ever got along without computing that works like we do – computing that’s environmentally aware, that displays information to us in context, and that looks, feels, and behaves like the real world.” I Just Threw My Phone Against The Pavement And It Shattered Into A Million Tiny Pieces Good call.   About the author Mark Wilson is a senior writer at Fast Company.

By: Shinmin Bali | Published: May 23, 2017 3:14 AM John Montgomery, global EVP, brand safety, GroupM News of Methbot late last year brought the spotlight back on ad fraud and the urgency with which it needs to be dealt with. The Google-YouTube controversy earlier this year is another example of why the conversation about brand safety is something that every advertiser needs to have. In this context, GroupM’s John Montgomery speaks to BrandWagon’s Shinmin Bali about why automated buying is the logical way forward, the relevance of brand safety, being ahead of fraudsters and more. Edited excerpts: What is your response to advertisers who ask why brand safety is important? As digital has become more data driven, we have been able to understand more of what makes it work. We can target behaviourally, we can attribute to the right source and we can generally get better RoI. But along with that comes a lot of complexity which in turn brings with it an amount of risk. Any area of risk in the digital supply chain is something we will mitigate. A lot of our clients are big content producers like NBC and Universal Music which are losing billions to pirate sites. In fact, pirate sites are earning money from advertisers in a way because ads end up showing on pirate sites as that’s where they figure the audience is. There are different markets at different stages of comfort with the digital environment. Is it then fair to say that brand safety is one of the teething troubles of the digital space? A year from now, another new risk might emerge. In the privacy area, GDPR (general data protection regulation) in the EU, which is a regulation about anybody sharing data with somebody else, is suddenly going to become a new issue. Sure, contextual brand safety has always been there but after February, there is a level of hysteria around it now. It will only get more complex and more important because it is fairly nascent. Some of it is teething problems, true, but each of these issues will require mitigation and a strategy. It will get better. But just because we know it will get better does not mean we don’t have to keep watching it. Also Watch: To what extent can digital ad fraud be minimised, say, in the Indian market? And how long can it take? We can bring it down to the same numbers that we see in Europe. We can bring it down to a low single-digit figure. In the West, the fraud was high but the moment we started measuring it, it dropped like a stone. I don’t know how long it is going to take for us to bring it down to the same levels as Europe, but the Indian market is a few years behind in terms of measurement. Having said that, it won’t take India as long as it has taken for, say, Europe because now the technology exists to counter fraud. The technology we are using in the US is the technology that can work here as well. Fraudsters usually work by looking into the KPIs advertisers are optimising. How can programmatic help deal with this? Cheaters are always one step ahead of the chasers. Methbot came out in December, 2016 but it was caught in a few days. It did cause some damage in those few days but it was not huge. That’s why we rely on our technology partners to stay ahead of it. Programmatic has always been given a bad reputation. I think it is unfair. It is a little bit like blaming road accidents on motorcars. It’s about the operator of the vehicle and not the car. It is the same case with programmatic. Often, programmatic is asked to operate in an open exchange and find the lowest cost inventory. As a result, of course, the brand risk will be higher in that space. But frankly, programmatic is just an optimisation technology. We have used programmatic in private exchanges and private marketplaces because it is as appropriate in a private market as it is in an open exchange. We have actually found in some developing markets that programmatic is safer because you have to measure. In countries like China, where there isn’t a lot of measurement, programmatic proves to be safer. Which KPIs could be fraud proof? Are volume-based and pay-per-click models still the right approach for advertising? All modes of buying (impressions, clicks, conversions, views, etc) are subject to fraud. SIVT (sophisticated in-valid traffic) is a highly evolved practice. It is important we use trusted third-party tools to block exposure to all kinds of fraudulent inventory sources. India still has a fair number of advertisers who do things traditionally. How does a brand come to realise, in its first brush with digital, to consider brand safety measures? For each day that a brand does not address safety, it is an opportunity lost where the brand could have been more viewable, with better quality inventory. Programmatic is about 10% or less but it will happen. It is one of those step change environments, like the move from analog to digital phones. Take for example YouTube; there are about 450 hours of video uploaded every minute and many hours of video viewed every day. So the only way for any advertiser, new or old, to make sense of this is to do it the automated way. We have an expression on our side of the business, ‘everything that can be bought programmatically, will be’. If that is true, advertisers are going to need to learn to do it extremely well. In the US, after being talked about for years, programmatic finally realistically took two years to catch on. It will happen in India too. Publishers are probably worried about the yield from programmatic and so they hang on to what reserved media can offer them, but there will be a momentum that will finally tip the scale. In hindsight, should players like Google and YouTube be penalised for failing to develop thorough systems to ensure the best possible brand-safe conditions? It was a case of free market mechanism. What was found is many advertisers pausing their advertising because they weren’t sure what was happening. Unless publishers respond to brand safety, they will get less business from big brands that are increasingly concerned about brand safety. So when you say penalised, it will happen through a free market environment. Shinmin.Bali@expressindia.com @shinminbali No Comments.

By Brian Koerber2017-05-22 20:54:05 UTC In the battle of household robots that people talk to instead of using their phones, at least we can all still be friends. There's an arms race going on between Google and Amazon to have the best personal assistant. Amazon has the Echo, and Google has the Home. Each of the slightly creepy robots have their own pros and cons, but Google just one-upped Amazon on cute Easter eggs. A YouTuber noticed that if you ask Google Home to "say hi to Alexa," it actually plays off one of the Echo's automatic responses.  "I'm so excited, I have a question for her. Alexa, will you be my friend?" the Home asks. Hearing the trigger word "Alexa," the Echo responds to the question with, "Of course we can be friends. You seem very nice." It's likely the Echo has no clue that a Google product is asking the question, because it will say this or something similar if a human asks. Points to Google for adding a cute and friendly Easter egg.  Kid rapper releases fidget spinner song that actually kinda slaps Little bear with green thumb helps woman garden Take a tiny fidget spinner wherever you go by putting it on your nails Fidget spinners may hot right now but this pup is not here for it Topics: Amazon Echo, easter egg, google home, Tech, Video, Videos, Watercooler About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

Photo / 123RF Taming the beasts of Silicon Valley is a thankless task for governments. Tread lightly, and you are accused of giving tech giants a free ride, but overstep the mark and you choke innovation. One train of thought is that politicians really shouldn't try to control the internet: the industry changes so quickly, and competition is so cut-throat, that by the time they have got round to creating rules, let alone enforcing them, the market will have been turned on its head by some teenager in a California garage. Once the dominant technology company was IBM, then it became Microsoft, which was in turn superseded by Google. The freedom of the internet, so the theory goes, does a much better job of stoking competition than regulators could ever do. The European Union spent years investigating Microsoft, over claims it abused the monopoly enjoyed by its Windows computer software to unfairly push its own web browser, Internet Explorer. But by the time it had slapped it with a €561m (NZ$901m) fine in 2013, the smartphone revolution was in full swing, and Internet Explorer had fallen to less than 25pc of the browser market, behind Google's Chrome and Mozilla's Firefox. It was not the heavy hand of regulators that had created competition in the market. It was innovation from Microsoft's rivals, and the company's own sluggishness. Any action from the EU came so late that the idea of Microsoft being a monopoly was laughable: its dominance had long since evaporated. Similar criticisms could be made against the Commission's long running investigation into Google over allegations it is abusing its search monopoly to promote its own online shopping services. Continued below. Related Content Agent on sex charges still selling houses Should tipping in NZ be mandatory? Paula Bennett thinks we should encourage top service Who do Kiwis trust the most? In 2010, when the probe started, one could argue that the regulator had a point, but since then internet shopping has moved towards mobile apps and websites like Amazon and eBay. By the time the EU gets round to fining Google, we may be browsing the aisles in virtual reality shopping centres. In most industries competition is assessed by pricing or market share. In Silicon Valley the fear is always of some looming technological threat. If supremacy is rarely entrenched, regulators can hardly accuse tech companies of abusing it. Or so the conventional wisdom goes. But in practice, the most powerful internet companies are becoming increasingly dominant and less prone to disruption than they look. If they were not, investors would be unlikely to ascribe such enormous valuations to today's Silicon Valley titans. Take Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg's company knows only too well the power of disruption. Shortly after Rupert Murdoch paid $580m (NZ$932m) for Myspace in 2005, Facebook swept in with a better website, destroying almost all of Myspace's value, as well as that of its one-time rival, Friends Reunited. Disruptive theory suggest that the same fate should await Facebook; that something should come along to do the same thing Zuckerberg did to Myspace. But the reality is that the company is so big, so powerful, that this is unlikely. Facebook's biggest threats to date came from other fast growing social apps, but these have been systematically eliminated, largely through acquisition. Instagram and WhatsApp, two potential competitors, were bought for $1b (NZ$1.4b) and $19b (NZ$27b) respectively. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. Photo / Getty Images More far-flung technologies that threaten to challenge Facebook, even years down the line, have been absorbed. The $2b (NZ$2.8b) purchase of virtual reality company Oculus in 2014 was not so much a statement of confidence in the next technological leap as a hedge against Facebook being left behind by it. The one upstart that Facebook hasn't bought, although it tried its best, was Snapchat. Snapchat's founder Evan Spiegel refused to sell, but in the last year Facebook has dedicated most of its creative energies to cloning most of Snapchat's features, using its superior scale to squeeze its smaller rival. The pattern is clear: identify a threat and neutralise it, by whatever means necessary. This is more than just smart business. Zuckerberg, who won't easily forget the teething problems Facebook had adapting its business from desktop computers to smartphones, is laser focused on making sure that he is not disrupted. So while these predictions are always dangerous, at this point it is very hard to see Facebook being toppled in the same way Myspace was. But as Facebook grows more powerful, regulators are taking more of an interest. There was plenty of evidence of that last week, when the company was fined €110m (NZ$176m) by the European Commission for misleading regulators when it bought WhatsApp in 2014. Some people say that it is not for government to regulate when it comes to technology and the internet. We disagree. UK Information Commissioner's Office Facebook had claimed it would not be able to share data between the two services, before, last year, starting to do just that. Two days before, the French data watchdog hit the company with an (admittedly piddly) €150,000 fine for unfairly tracking its users. The British equivalent, the Information Commissioner's Office, said it would investigate whether political parties were exploiting the data Facebook gathered to target them, and Theresa May's election manifesto spoke of stricter rules for internet companies. "Some people say that it is not for government to regulate when it comes to technology and the internet. We disagree," it read. The manifesto spoke of fines for internet companies that fail to remove harmful content, and an industry-wide levy for social media firms. No one company was not mentioned by name, but there is little doubt about who would be affected by these rules. Facebook has done a remarkable job of sidelining potential competition. Its next fight - with governments - may be more of a challenge. - Daily Telegraph UK By James Titcomb Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

(EPA/Jeon Heon-Kyun) Share Written by Zheping Huang Obsession Machines with Brains May 22, 2017 From May 23, Google’s artificial intelligence program AlphaGo is taking on the world’s No. 1 player Ke Jie in three games in a five-day festival of Go in the game’s birthplace, China. The millennia-old board game of Go had long been thought of being beyond the reach of AI algorithms thanks to its notorious complexity, with each move involving a much higher number of possible plays than, for example, chess. But AlphaGo’s previous sweeping wins against a long list of top human players have proved that AI can play the game at a level no human likely ever could attain, something thought impossible as recently as 2014. That’s why 19-year-old Ke stands as the last hope against complete machine domination over one of the world’s most difficult board games. The backstory Just over a year ago, AlphaGo set a milestone in the history of AI by taking down South Korea’s Lee Sedol, one of the world’s best Go players. But Ke didn’t want to play AlphaGo at the time, instead agreeing to take on the AI in the future. This January, Google’s DeepMind machine-learning team secretly put an upgraded AlphaGo onto two online board-game platforms to test its skill against top human players. During the test, AlphaGo racked up 60 wins and zero losses. Ke lost all the three games he played with the AI. Ke revealed that he was taken to hospital after the three losses, but didn’t provide details. If that were not the case, Ke wrote on China’s Twitter-like Weibo, he would have used the “one last move” he had prepared. Last month, DeepMind announced that the “Future of Go Summit,” co-hosted by the Chinese government, would be held May 23-27 in the eastern Chinese coastal town of Wuzhen, and that the centerpiece of the event would be a three-game match between Ke and AlphaGo. The odds AlphaGo can continue to improve, playing against itself and humans, learning as it simulates, which makes it harder and harder to conquer as each day passes. Fellow player Gu Li, a former world champion, gives Ke only 10% chance of winning just one game against AlphaGo; AI expert Lee Kai-Fu, a former Google and Microsoft executive, says Ke’s chance of winning even one game is almost zero (link in Chinese). Still, Korea’s Lee did win one game against AlphaGo last year—apparently unpredictability works. Deepmind has said that AlphaGo isn’t meant to diminish Go, but to make human players “stronger and more creative,” as they test out new moves and strategies after being inspired by the AI. Team play Other matches will feature professional Go players teaming up with and against AlphaGo. In the “Pair Go” format, a Chinese player will play against another, but both will have their own AlphaGo teammates that take over every other turn. In the “Team Go” format, five Chinese players will try to defeat AlphaGo together. These matches are scheduled in between the three games between Ke and AlphaGo. How to watch live The first game between Ke and AlphaGo is scheduled May 23 10.30am Beijing time (May 22 10.30pm EST); and the second and final game will take place at the same time on May 25 and May 27, respectively. DeepMind says it will livestream the matches and post updates and expert comments on this page and on its Twitter account. Excited to see what we’ll discover at the Future of Go Summit next week.

Not only could it cost you your job, but it also betrays the values that makes us a community." So reads an ominous email titled "INTERNAL ONLY. REALLY" sent from the head of investigations at Google, Brian Katz. Katz was responding to a leak of internal jokes about Nest CEO Tony Fadell as well as a transcript of a talk he gave to an "open meeting" of Google employees. The email notes: "We identified the people who leaked the TGIF transcript and memes. Because of their intentional disregard of confidentiality, they've been fired." Except one of the people Katz fired claims he didn't leak anything. And so late last year he sued Google for unjustly terminating his contract and pointed the finger at a corporate culture of secrecy and fear. Internally, employees are encouraged to monitor their colleagues and report anything they think is suspicious to the internal investigative team that Katz heads up, the anonymous employee claims. That amounts to an internal "spying program," the lawsuit claims, and is illegal. The same former employee also took his case to the National Labor Relations Board. In the latest filing [PDF] in the legal case, "John Doe" includes Katz's email as an exhibit [PDF] and an example of Google's "illegal policies," alongside redacted copies of confidentiality agreements that Google employees are required to sign and job offer letters that note signing a confidentiality agreement is compulsory. The filing is an effort to get the court to order Google to release more documents about its internal policies and most likely documents surrounding the investigation and firing of employees over the Fadell meme leaks. Brick Fadell had been criticized for failing to come up with any new products at Nest, and for introducing a difficult work culture that went against the Google grain. But his decision to end support for Revolv, a popular IoT gateway, effectively bricked it and brought down a storm of criticism on the company. On Google's internal noticeboard amusing memes were posted mocking Fadell. Then, when he gave a subsequent talk at Google headquarters, the transcript of the meeting was leaked to the press. Google embarked on a "witch hunt," according to the employee – the result of which saw him fired. He filed his case with the National Labor Relations Board and just two weeks later Fadell announced he was "quitting" as Nest CEO. In that case, most of the claims against Google, including unlawful surveillance, were dismissed [PDF] in March due to the fact that he was not recognized as a formal "employee" thanks to portions of California's employment laws. He has appealed the decision. Meanwhile, Brian Katz – a former State department special agent who also oversees executive protection at Google – notes in his letter that: "We've all worked hard to create an environment where we can share information openly. Our culture relies on our ability to trust each other – we share a lot of confidential information, but we also commit to keeping it inside the company. We don't want that to change." You can be certain that Google will also want to keep the details of its investigations "inside the company," so expect a robust response from the company to its former employee's efforts to open things up. ® Tips and corrections 4 Comments MORE Google Leak Sign up to our Newsletter Get IT in your inbox daily Subscribe More from The Register US judges say you can Google Google, but you can't google Google The Chocolate Factory is spared the aspirin treatment by the 9th District Court 58 Comments Google's PHP API client has XSS vulnerability Patch promised 2 Comments Google opens patent pool for Android Protects against trolls maybe.

The 2017 Google I/O developer conference has left no doubt that the company sees its future linked to progress in artificial intelligence (AI) gadgets. But its closest competitors have long embarked on the same path.At its annual developer conference at an outdoor concert venue near its main campus in Mountain View, California, internet giant Google has unveiled its vision for computing centered around artificial intelligence. CEO Sundar Pichai made it abundantly clear that the way to go for computing was from a mobile-first to an AI-first world. “It’s forcing us to reimagine our products for a world that allows a more natural, seamless way of interacting with technology,” he said during an opening presentation. What Pichai has in mind is to let people engage computers conversationally to a much larger extent than seen before, have software anticipate our needs and let smartphone cameras recognize what they see and provide information about various objects immediately. Whether users always really want their gadgets to be so “talkative” is a different matter, but the direction is clear. The only problem for Google is it’s not alone out there in the world, with a host of powerful competitors heading in the same direction. Google’s rivals do not sleep At its developer conference, Google talked about boosting the role of its AI-based digital helper called Assistant. It was launched last year on the company’s Pixel smartphones and later expanded to phones running Android Nougat. Now Google is releasing the voice-controlled assistant on a free app designed for iPhone’s operating system, thus basically competing with Apple on its own turf. Experts from verge.com have argued that bringing the Assistant to iOS can’t hurt. But they emphasize that it’s hard to see Google really giving Apple’s Siri much competition. Why’s that? Well, because Siri has been a built-in service, while Google’s assistant requires an app download. Google itself doesn’t see that as a disadvantage, hoping that its Assistant will help iOS users to get what they want more quickly, because it can draw upon the knowledge the company has accumulated while running the world’s most popular search engine. Not time to rest on its laurels Yes, the Google search engine may indeed be the most popular. It’s dominant in a huge number of countries. China is an exception, where Baidu rules. In Russia, Yandex is king. But Google itself knows that even in the nations where it’s users’ top choice, Amazon is a powerful rival, especially when it comes to product search capabilities. Researchers in the US have found that Amaozon beats Google as a starting point for product search. Shopping searches on Google have been largely flat, while Amazon’s have grown rapidly. And another rival in this field is breathing down Google’s neck. Facebook is now widely accepted as a major competitor to Google from a mobile and market share perspective. Facebook is second to none when it comes to driving traffic to a website as part of a news cycle. Sneaking into your home The developer conference has confirmed Google’s desire to get into our living rooms. It’s announced new features to its internet-connected Home speaker such as hands-free calling. Home will also be able to control and interact with a variety of household appliances later this year. You could ask the digital assistant within Home to turn on the dishwasher or set the temperature on the oven. Sounds great? Sure, but that’s already available on Amazon’s Echo speaker and other devices that use its Alexa assistant. Among the more exotic novelties that Google presented was its new Lens tool. It lets people point their camera at things to find out more about them automatically, like pointing the camera to a flower and being told its name. But even in this specific field, Google is not alone. Samsung for instance is trying something similar with its new Bixby Vision feature on the Galaxy S8 phones. In a nutshell, Google has announced a whole range of new features, or bells and whistles, if you will. But tech experts agree that several of them are already offered by rivals such as Amazon, Apple or Facebook, to name but a few. © 2017 Daily News Egypt.

Life is easier on iPhone. And that starts as soon as you turn it on. The company answers ten questions for Android users considering the switch. Will it be easy to switch to iPhone? Yes, it will. There’s no need to save your stuff elsewhere before switching from Android. Just download the Move to iOS app from the Google Play Store and it securely transfers your content for you. That means things like your photos, videos, contacts, calendars, mail accounts, message history, and free apps — including Google Apps. And you can trade in your old smartphone, if eligible, for credit toward your new iPhone. Is the camera as good as they say? More pictures are taken on iPhone than any other camera in the world. We design the hardware and software together using second-to-none technology, so you can shoot amazing photos and videos in modes like Slo-Mo, Portrait, Time-Lapse, and more. iPhone also has cool features like Memories, which automatically compiles your favorite moments into a movie. Why is iPhone so fast? iPhone runs on high-performance chips that are custom-designed by Apple — including the most powerful chip ever in a smartphone. And because these chips are so efficient, iPhone delivers long battery life. Combine all that with the latest iOS updates offering smart new features, and everything you do on iPhone feels fast and fluid. Will iPhone be easy to use? You bet. Ease of use is at the core of everything Apple creates, and iOS is designed to be both simple and intuitive. With a swipe of your finger or a single tap, you can open apps, make a purchase with Apple Pay, or customize your iPhone. It also comes with the Tips app, so you can get the most out of your device. How does iPhone help protect my personal information? Privacy is a priority with Apple. Unlike many other phones, important data on your iPhone is encrypted from the start and protected by your passcode. Apple apps like Maps and Safari help to keep private all the places you go and the sites you visit, and Apple will not sell your information to anyone for any reason. Best of all we provide easy-to-install software updates that help to protect your device and your data from security threats. What makes Messages so great? The Messages app is both simple and powerful. It doesn’t just send messages — it also lets you hail rides, book restaurants, and even shoot lasers. All your conversations will be kept private, because every message is encrypted from end to end. And, of course, you can use other messaging apps like WeChat, WhatsApp, or Facebook Messenger, too. Can I get help from a real person? No matter where you are, we have real human beings ready to help. Whether you want to know more about switching, or about software on your new iPhone, Apple’s award-winning support team offers assistance of any kind. Just call a Specialist, chat online, or visit an Apple Store. There’s also an Apple Support app and a dedicated Twitter handle @AppleSupport. Can I switch at an Apple Store? Absolutely. Apple Specialists are friendly, knowledgeable, and ready to assist you in switching. They can activate your new iPhone with a carrier of your choice and help you transfer your important content to your new device. You can also attend How To sessions, which are part of the Today at Apple program, to learn how to do even more with iPhone. What about the environment? We think about the environment all the time. Every time you send an iMessage, make a FaceTime call, or ask Siri a question, those tasks are handled by Apple data servers running on 100 percent renewable energy. And when you switch to iPhone, we’ll even recycle your Android phone for you. Will I love my iPhone? iPhone has industry-leading satisfaction rates — in fact, 97 percent of people who have an iPhone say they love it. That’s a lot of smiling selfies. A lot of happy emoji. And a lot of people who are glad they chose the world’s most loved smartphone. Check out the site at the link below...

Polk Wagner discuss the Waymo vs. Uber lawsuit. http://media.blubrry.com/kw/p/d1c25a6gwz7q5e.cloudfront.net/audio/20170518C-KWR-MacDuffie-Wagner-Clancy.mp3 Supports K@W's Technology Content A federal judge’s orders last week in a lawsuit by Google’s parent company, Alphabet, against ride-hailing app company Uber may have launched a major rethink on how the automobile industry braces for competition and protects its intellectual property (IP). Alphabet subsidiary Waymo had accused Uber of stealing trade secrets and patent infringement by hiring Anthony Levandowski, an engineer who formerly led Google’s driverless car project, and buying a firm he had founded after leaving Google. Judge William Alsup of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ordered Levandowski to turn over some 14,000 documents he allegedly downloaded before he left Google and granted a preliminary injunction Waymo sought to prevent Uber from using know-how Levandowski brought to the firm. Judge Alsup also referred the case for a federal criminal investigation. Uber has since taken Levandowski off its driverless car project and asked him to comply with the court order or risk termination of his job. Meanwhile, Levandowski has remained silent on the matter, citing the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Wharton management professor John Paul MacDuffie, who is also director of the school’s Program on Vehicle and Mobility Innovation; Dorothy Glancy, professor of law at Santa Clara University; and Penn Law professor R. Polk Wagner examined the far-reaching changes the Waymo-Uber lawsuit could bring, on the Knowledge@Wharton show on Wharton Business Radio on SiriusXM channel 111. (Listen to the podcast at the top of this page.) Below are select highlights from their discussion: Revisiting Trade Secrets as IP Protection: According to Wagner, trade secret law has traditionally not been seen as “a particularly reliable or useful way to protect technology,” partly because it is difficult to keep such technology secret when it is implemented and products based on it are sold. But that conventional wisdom is up for a reexamination. “If Google is successful at putting a dent in Uber’s ability to compete in this field as a result of this case, then people will take notice of that and you will probably see more people using trade secrets” as part of their intellectual property strategies, said Wagner. “On the other hand, if Google is not successful, or even if they win this case and they don’t slow Uber down very much, then people are going to go back to what we traditionally think of in IP, which is unless you have a patent covering the technology, you don’t have a lot of protection.” “These are trade secrets that are incredibly hot and at the heart of a fierce and fast-paced competition around an exciting new technology.” –John Paul MacDuffie Added MacDuffie: “These are trade secrets that are incredibly hot and at the heart of a fierce and fast-paced competition around an exciting new technology.” Sponsored Content: Wagner’s guess is that in the meantime, all the companies involved in driverless technology must be filing as many patents as they can. “So you are going to see a wave of patent litigation, and that is going to begin as soon as some of these patents start to actually issue, which is in the near future — and some of them are probably already issued,” he said. Coalitions, Collaborations the Way Ahead: According to MacDuffie, driverless car technology will spur the automobile industry — and the technology companies in the space — to develop completely new business models. He raised some fundamental questions on how that model might work. Will individuals buy their own autonomous vehicles and lease them to, say, an Uber? Will Uber become a company that is good at managing a fleet of hard assets like cars? Or will other firms that already have that capability — including auto companies — join the fray? “There are a lot of possibilities of combinations of companies and skills that would be needed in the end,” MacDuffie predicted. “We may end up with competition among a few companies or coalitions of companies that have different models of how they put the hardware and software together for driverless cars. What makes them win may not be being first; it may be some other attribute of performance.” Wagner noted that driverless technology appears to be evolving as “platform technologies,” similar to a dominant company like a Microsoft building the Windows platform on which others build products. “Being at the bottom of that stack, or being the Windows of the driverless car world, is enormously valuable,” he said, adding that the battle for those stakes is being fought right now. “In an industry with significant network effects, which this certainly appears to be, they can get locked into — for potentially decades — an area which will have a lot of impact on our society.” “A general rule of thumb with trade secret litigation is if there is trade secret litigation, something has gone horribly wrong.” –R. Polk Wagner Uncertain Policy Terrain for Driverless Technology: According to Glancy, it would be tough to draft public policy relating to driverless vehicles if trade secret laws are to be dominant. She noted that in her study of all the pleadings in the Waymo-Uber case, major parts are redacted because of the trade secrets law. “I don’t see how it is easy to make good public policy about something like driverless cars when all of these particulars of what makes them work keep getting redacted from the only public papers we have about this, which are the court pleadings,” she said. Glancy also questioned Judge Alsup’s ordering Levandowski to turn over the documents he took from Google and for Uber to insulate its employees against each other to avoid any continued IP vulnerabilities. “How in the world – once a trade secret has been disclosed to a competitor – do you put the genie back in the bottle?” she asked. “A general rule of thumb with trade secret litigation is if there is trade secret litigation, something has gone horribly wrong,” Wagner said. “You are almost certainly not going to survive the litigation with your trade secret intact. The technology is already out of the box; you can’t undo that now, no matter what.” “How in the world – once a trade secret has been disclosed to a competitor – do you put the genie back in the bottle?” –Dorothy Glancy Who Will Make the Cheapest Lidar: At the heart of the Waymo-Uber battle is the so-called Lidar technology, a laser-based scanning and mapping mechanism that creates real-time 3D images and allows a vehicle to “see” its surroundings and thereby detect traffic and pedestrians. Current costs are trending at between $8,000 and $10,000 each, and a driverless car would need four of them, noted Glancy. “A lot of the Google advances were on the cost side of Lidar and not so much on the functionality of it,” said MacDuffie. “Google was moving faster to get to the low-cost Lidar, and that’s what they are saying Uber was stealing.” Many firms are working in this space, and the goal is to bring down Lidar’s cost to between $400 and $500 apiece with economies of scale, he added.

And just recently, Google has released a new VR tool to the Play Store – it’s called Daydream Elements, and it’s already available for download on Daydream-enabled devices. According to Google: “Daydream Elements is a collection of tech demos that showcase principles and best practices for developing high-quality VR experiences. The core mechanics in each demo are built to be easily configurable and reusable for your own applications.” Think of this as a primer on how to create VR apps for Daydream. As of today, there are three VR principles covered by demos in Daydream Elements – these include Locomotion, Menus and virtual controls, and Rendering and lighting. Details to the tech demos are covered in more information available via the source link below.

Your 23-year-old nephew, who travels around the country for his job as a college sports writer, has devoted 233 hours of his young life to writing 932 reviews on Yelp (932 reviews x @15 minutes per review). Yes, our local SEO industry knows that my dad and your nephew need to find accurate NAP on local business listings to actually find and get to business locations. This is what makes our historic focus on citation data management totally reasonable. But reviews are what help a business to be chosen. Phil Rozek kindly highlighted a comment of mine as being among the most insightful on the Local Search Ranking Factors 2017 survey: “If I could drive home one topic in 2017 for local business owners, it would surround everything relating to reviews. This would include rating, consumer sentiment, velocity, authenticity, and owner responses, both on third-party platforms and native website reviews/testimonials pages. The influence of reviews is enormous; I have come to see them as almost as powerful as the NAP on your citations. NAP must be accurate for rankings and consumer direction, but reviews sell.” I’d like to take a few moments here to dive deeper into that list of review elements. It’s my hope that this post is one you can take to your clients, team or boss to urge creative and financial allocations for a review management campaign that reflects the central importance of this special form of marketing. Ratings: At-a-glance consumer impressions and impactful rankings filter Whether they’re stars or circles, the majority of rating icons send a 1–5 point signal to consumers that can be instantly understood. This symbol system has been around since at least the 1820s; it’s deeply ingrained in all our brains as a judgement of value. So, when a modern Internet user is making a snap decision, like where to grab a taco, the food truck with 5 Yelp stars is automatically going to look more appealing than the one with only 2. Ratings can also catch the eye when Schema (or Google serendipity) causes them to appear within organic SERPs or knowledge panels. All of the above is well-understood, but while the exact impact of high star ratings on local pack rankings has long been speculative (it’s only factor #24 in this year’s Local Search Ranking Factors), we may have just reached a new day with Google. The ability to filter local finder results by rating has been around for some time, but in May, Google began testing the application of a “highly rated” snippet on hotel rankings in the local packs. Meanwhile, searches with the format of “best X in city” (e.g. best burrito in Dallas) appear to be defaulting to local results made up of businesses that have earned a minimum average of 4 stars. It’s early days yet, but totally safe for us to assume that Google is paying increased attention to numeric ratings as indicators of relevance. Because we’re now reaching the point from which we can comfortably speculate that high ratings will tend to start correlating more frequently with high local rankings, it’s imperative for local businesses to view low ratings as the serious impediments to growth that they truly are. Big brands, in particular, must stop ignoring low star ratings, or they may find themselves not only having to close multiple store locations, but also, to be on the losing end of competing for rankings for their open stores when smaller competitors surpass their standards of cleanliness, quality, and employee behavior. Consumer sentiment: The local business story your customers are writing for you Here is a randomly chosen Google 3-pack result when searching just for “tacos” in a small city in the San Francisco Bay Area: We’ve just been talking about ratings, and you can look at a result like this to get that instant gut feeling about the 4-star-rated eateries vs. the 2-star place. Now, let’s open the book on business #3 and see precisely what kind of story its consumers are writing. This is the first step towards doing a professional review audit for any business whose troubling reviews may point to future closure if problems aren’t fixed. A full audit would look at all relevant review platforms, but we’ll be brief here and just look at Google and Yelp and sort negative sentiments by type: It’s easy to ding fast food chains. Their business model isn’t commonly associated with fine dining or the kind of high wages that tend to promote employee excellence. In some ways, I think of them as extreme examples. Yet, they serve as good teaching models for how even the most modest-quality offerings create certain expectations in the minds of consumers, and when those basic expectations aren’t met, it’s enough of a story for consumers to share in the form of reviews. This particular restaurant location has an obvious problem with slow service, orders being filled incorrectly, and employees who have not been trained to represent the brand in a knowledgeable, friendly, or accessible manner. Maybe a business you are auditing has pain points surrounding outdated fixtures or low standards of cleanliness. Whatever the case, when the incoming consumer turns to the review world, their eyes scan the story as it scrolls down their screen. Repeat mentions of a particular negative issue can create enough of a theme to turn the potential customer away. One survey says only 13% of people will choose a business that has wound up with a 1–2 star rating based on poor reviews. Who can afford to let the other 87% of consumers go elsewhere? There are 20 restaurants showing up in Google’s local finder for my “tacos” search, highlighted above. Taco Bell is managing to hold the #3 spot in the local pack right now, perhaps due to brand authority. My question is, what happens next, particularly if Google is going to amplify ratings and review sentiment in the overall local ranking mix? Will this chain location continue to beat out 4-star restaurants with 100+ positive reviews, or will it slip down as consumers continue to chronicle specific and unresolved issues? No third-party brand controls Google, but your brand can open the book right now and make maximum use of the story your customers are constantly publishing — for free. By taking review insights as real and representative of all the customers who don’t speak up, and by actively addressing repeatedly cited issues, you could be making one of the smartest decisions in your company’s history. Velocity/recency: Just enough of a timely good thing This is one of the easiest aspects of review management to teach clients. You can sum it up in one sentence: don’t get too many reviews at once on any given platform but do get enough reviews on an ongoing basis to avoid looking like you’ve gone out of business. For a little more background on the first part of that statement, watch Mary Bowling describing in this LocalU video how she audited a law firm that went from zero to thirty 5-star reviews within a single month. Sudden gluts of reviews like this not only look odd to alert customers, but they can trip review platform filters, resulting in removal. Remember, reviews are a business lifetime effort, not a race. Get a few this month, a few next month, and a few the month after that. Keep going. The second half of the review timing paradigm relates to not running out of steam in your acquisition campaigns. One survey found that 73% of consumers don’t believe that reviews that are older than 3 months are still relevant to them, yet you will frequently encounter businesses that haven’t earned a new review in over a year. It makes you wonder if the place is still in business, or if it’s in business but is so unimpressive that no one is bothering to review it. While I’d argue that review recency may be more important in review-oriented industries (like restaurants) vs. those that aren’t quite as actively reviewed (like septic system servicing), the idea here is similar to that of velocity, in that you want to keep things going. Don’t run a big review acquisition campaign in January and then forget about outreach for the rest of the year. A moderate, steady pace of acquisition is ideal. Authenticity: Honesty is the only honest policy For me, this is one of the most prickly and interesting aspects of the review world. Three opposing forces meet on this playing field: business ethics, business education, and the temptations engendered by the obvious limitations of review platforms to police themselves. I recently began a basic audit of a family-owned restaurant for a friend of a friend. Within minutes, I realized that the family had been reviewing their own restaurant on Yelp (a glaring violation of Yelp’s policy). I felt sorry to see this, but being acquainted with the people involved (and knowing them to be quite nice!), I highly doubted they had done this out of some dark impulse to deceive the public. Rather, my guess was that they may have thought they were “getting the ball rolling” for their new business, hoping to inspire real reviews. My gut feeling was that they simply lacked the necessary education to understand that they were being dishonest with their community and how this could lead to them being publicly shamed by Yelp, if caught. In such a scenario, there is definitely opportunity for the marketer to offer the necessary education to describe the risks involved in tying a brand to misleading practices, highlighting how vital it is to build trust within the local community. Fake positive reviews aren’t building anything real on which a company can stake its future. Ethical business owners will catch on when you explain this in honest terms and can then begin marketing themselves in smarter ways. But then there's the other side. Mike Blumenthal recently wrote of his discovery of the largest review spam network he’d ever encountered and there's simply no way to confuse organized, global review spam with a busy small business making a wrong, novice move. Real temptation resides in this scenario, because, as Blumenthal states: “Review spam at this scale, unencumbered by any Google enforcement, calls into question every review that Google has. Fake business listings are bad, but businesses with 20, or 50, or 150 fake reviews are worse. They deceive the searcher and the buying public and they stain every real review, every honest business, and Google.” When a platform like Google makes it easy to “get away with” deception, companies lacking ethics will take advantage of the opportunity. All we can do, as marketers, is to offer the education that helps ethical businesses make honest choices. We can simply pose the question: Is it better to fake your business’ success or to actually achieve success? On a final note, authenticity is a two-way street in the review world. When spammers target good businesses with fake, negative reviews, this also presents a totally false picture to the consumer public. I highly recommend reading about Whitespark’s recent successes in getting fake Google reviews removed. No guarantees here, but excellent strategic advice. Owner responses: Your contributions to the consumer story In previous Moz blog posts, I’ve highlighted the five types of Google My Business reviews and how to respond to them, and I’ve diagrammed a real-world example of how a terrible owner response can make a bad situation even worse. If the world of owner responses is somewhat new to you, I hope you’ll take a gander at both of those. Here, I’d like to focus on a specific aspect of owner responses, as it relates to the story reviews are telling about your business. We’ve discussed above the tremendous insight consumer sentiment can provide into a company’s pain points. Negative reviews can be a roadmap to resolving repeatedly cited problems. They are inherently valuable in this regard, and by dint of their high visibility, they carry the inherent opportunity for the business owner to make a very public showing of accountability in the form of owner responses. A business can state all it wants on its website that it offers lightning-quick service, but when reviews complain of 20-minute waits for fast food, which source do you think the average consumer will trust? The truth is, the hypothetical restaurant has a problem. They're not going to be able to resolve slow service overnight. Some issues are going to require real planning and real changes to overcome. So what can the owner do in this case? Whistle past the graveyard, claiming everything is actually fine now, guaranteeing further disappointed expectations and further negative reviews resulting therefrom? Be gutsy and honest, sharing exactly what realizations the business has had due to the negative reviews, what the obstacles are to fixing the problems, and what solutions the business is implementing to do their best to overcome those obstacles? Let’s look at this in living color: In yellow, the owner response is basically telling the story that the business is ignoring a legitimate complaint, and frankly, couldn’t care less. In blue, the owner has jumped right into the storyline, having the guts to take the blame, apologize, explain what happened and promise a fix — not an instant one, but a fix on the way. In the end, the narrative is going to go on with or without input from the owner, but in the blue example, the owner is taking the steering wheel into his own hands for at least part of the road trip. That initiative could save not just his franchise location, but the brand at large. Just ask Florian Huebner: “Over the course of 2013 customers of Yi-Ko Holding’s restaurants increasingly left public online reviews about “broken and dirty furniture,” “sleeping and indifferent staff,” and “mice running around in the kitchen.” Per the nature of a franchise system, to the typical consumer it was unclear that these problems were limited to this individual franchisee. Consequently, the Burger King brand as a whole began to deteriorate and customers reduced their consumption across all locations, leading to revenue declines of up to 33% for some other franchisees.” Positive news for small businesses working like mad to compete: You have more agility to put initiatives into quick action than the big brands do. Companies with 1,000 locations may let negative reviews go unanswered because they lack a clear policy or hierarchy for owner responses, but smaller enterprises can literally turn this around in a day. Just sit down at the nearest computer, claim your review profiles, and jump into the story with the goal of hearing, impressing, and keeping every single customer you can. Big brands: The challenge for you is larger, by dint of your size, but you’ve also likely got the infrastructure to make this task no problem. You just have to assign the right people to the job, with thoughtful guidelines for ensuring your brand is being represented in a winning way. NAP and reviews: The 1–2 punch combo every local business must practice When traveling salesman Duncan Hines first published his 1935 review guide Adventures in Good Eating, he was pioneering what we think of today as local SEO. Here is my color-coded version of his review of the business that would one day become KFC. It should look strangely familiar to every one of you who has ever tackled citation management: No phone number on this “citation,” of course, but then again telephones were quite a luxury in 1935. Barring that element, this simple and historic review has the core earmarks of a modern local business listing. It has location data and review data; it’s the 1–2 punch combo every local business still needs to get right today. Without the NAP, the business can’t be found. Without the sentiment, the business gives little reason to be chosen. Are you heading to a team meeting today? Preparing to chat with an incoming client? Make the winning combo as simple as possible, like this: We’ve got to manage our local business listings so that they’re accessible, accurate, and complete. We can automate much of this (check out Moz Local) so that we get found. We’ve got to breathe life into the listings so that they act as interactive advertisements, helping us get chosen. We can do this by earning reviews and responding to them. This is our company heartbeat — our story. From Duncan Hines to the digital age, there may be nothing new under the sun in marketing, but when you spend year after year looking at the sadly neglected review portions of local business listings, you realize you may have something to teach that is new news to somebody. So go for it — communicate this stuff, and good luck at your next big meeting!

I mention this in the section about the fast food restaurant outranking businesses with many more positive reviews than they have earned. So, yes, we're still at the point in which it's hard to pinpoint the correlation between high ratings and high rankings, but the couple of examples I've given of Google clearly increasing their focus on this metric are a big hint to us that they are at work on this, particularly the "best X in city" searches defaulting to packs made up of businesses with 4+ star ratings only. I believe we're reaching a tipping point with this, based on what we're observing Google doing. So, a good way to think of this might be that, yes, there is a formula; it's Google local ranking algo, but there are believed to be several hundred factors being taken into account when Google orders its local rankings. Because of this, when you see a business with fewer and worse reviews outranking one with more and better reviews, you have to assume that factors other than review count or sentiment are causing this. It could be the age of the listing, domain authority, user factors like clicks-for-directions, spam, or a variety of other things, combining to push one business up above its competitors. You basically have to do a competitive audit to try to identify what is moving the needle in a specific set of results, and even then, you'll have to make educated guesses, because we don't know ALL of the ranking factors that are part of Google's algo. Good comment, Cory. Thank you so much for discussing this further! 1 0 Reply <p>Hi Cory,</p>

<p>What you've observed is correct - there are countless examples of businesses with less and worse reviews outranking those with more a better reviews. I mention this in the section about the fast food restaurant outranking businesses with many more positive reviews than they have earned. So, yes, we're still at the point in which it's hard to pinpoint the correlation between high ratings and high rankings, but the couple of examples I've given of Google clearly increasing their focus on this metric are a big hint to us that they are at work on this, particularly the "best X in city" searches defaulting to packs made up of businesses with 4+ star ratings only.

When we searching 'Taco in USA', the business name 'Taco Bell' showing up in 2nd place and business 'Taco USA' in 1st place in the local data pack. Obviously 'keyword included business name' is an another major factor for ranking. My question is, how can we maintain citation consistency without losing ranking in the Local data pack? E.g. - In the last year, My business name 'Apple Fix' (phone service store) didn't appear in Local data pack for the keyword 'apple service center' So I rename my business name as 'apple service center - Apple Fix'. Now the business showing in no. 1 place, but I lost my citation consistency. Agree, Reviews are a lifetime effort. But as an analyst I faced many fake review issues in last month back, which is still unsolved. I noticed that the business owner response well to fake reviews, they report by flag option and also asked to Google community. But many times they didn't fix it. As we know that new and positive reviews downgrade the fake/negative reviews, But the earlier rating is a part of overall rating and it will affect the overall rating of the business. Thank you.

I'll try to respond to each. - Yes, keywords in the business name remain a strong local ranking factor. It's a good thing to consider when naming a new business. Unfortunately, it's a also a ranking loophole for businesses that add erroneous keywords to their business name (like adding a city name or some other modifier) in order to rank well. People report this practice moving their listings up an average of 1-4 spots, and I recently saw an SEO reporting that it moved a listing up 6 spots (see the comments on this post: http://blumenthals.com/blog/2017/05/20/should-you-...). Google just isn't doing a good job in upholding their own rule on this which states absolutely clearly that they forbid the practice of stuffing the business title. So, for now, both legitimate keywords in the business title and forbidden keywords in the business title are still highly influencing rank. - In your particular case, if you've legally changed your business name with appropriate gov. agencies to "Apple Service Center - Apple Fix" then you will need to update all of your citations, your website and any other references to your business name to reflect that change of business name. A product like Moz Local can help you automate this when a re-brand happens so that you can achieve consistency once again. However, if you've simply edited the Google My Business business name in order to improve rankings, then this would be a guideline violation. As Mike Blumenthal is discussing in the post I've just linked to, many business owners debate whether they should break Google's guidelines if it will improve their rankings, and it can be tempting to do this because of Google's lack of enforcement of strong penalties for rule-breakers. My advice is not to go down that road. We have seen many historic examples of businesses getting away with certain practices for years, and then a new update or filter is put in place that has significantly negatively impacted the businesses involved, resulting in massive ranking loss, suspensions, etc. Right now, Google appears to be sitting idle while countless businesses are breaking the guidelines surrounding keyword stuffing business names, but I personally wouldn't want to tie any client's business to a practice that relies on Google's permanent idleness. I wouldn't advocate this type of risk taking. So, my suggestion to businesses in this situation is to either legally re-brand their company, or, keep their brand and try to focus on other factors that can hopefully increase rank while reporting any competitors who are breaking guidelines. It's not a perfect model, but it's, at least, a safe one. Hope these thoughts are helpful! 2 0 Reply <p>Hi Kuldeep!</p>

During much of the ’60s and ’70s, Oakes, who was an alumni of San Francisco State University, peacefully protested for the rights and recognition of Native American peoples. The Richard Oakes Google Doodle on the Google.com landing page shows Richard Oakes in the forefront of the image with three significant images of Oakes life in the background. One of the images in the Richard Oakes Google Doodle is of the Akwesasne reserve of the Akwesasne Mohawk people, which is a unique territory that straddles the U.S. and Canadian borders. Alcatraz and Pit River are the other two landmarks.

In 1970, Richard Oakes joined the Pit River Indian nation in an attempt to reclaim their territories from the Pacific Gas and Electric Company. In 1972, and at the tragically young of of only 30, Richard Oakes was assassinated by Michael Morgan, a YMCA camp manager who was later acquitted.

Photo: Screenshot. An Anti-Defamation League (ADL) cyber-hate expert has called on Google to take action following revelations that Holocaust deniers are included in the image bar results for a search of “Holocaust historians.” Jonathan Vick — the ADL’s associate director of investigative technology and cyber-hate — said he was certain that Google would edit the algorithm for the search results to ensure the exclusion of deniers and antisemites. “[Google has] been confronted with this sort of issue in the past, and there is not real question of how they will respond,” Vick said. “These are unintended and painful consequences of an algorithm that clearly needs human intervention.” Related coverage May 22, 2017 9:48 pm 0 Nineteen Murdered, More than 50 Injured, as Terror Bomb Rips Through Pop Concert in Manchester, UK Nineteen people were killed and more than 50 injured after a terrorist bomb ripped through a pop concert in the English city... The very first “historian” listed is David Irving, with other results including David Hoggan, author of The Myth of the Six Million, and one-time Columbia University historian Harry Elmer Barnes, who wrote a 1964 article titled “The Zionist Fraud,” in which he claimed Israel manufactured the Holocaust to squeeze reparations from Germany. All three individuals were discussed in Deborah Lipstadt’s Denying the Holocaust, published in 1993 and considered by many to be a seminal text in the study of Holocaust denial. This was the book that triggered Irving’s failed 1996 libel suit against Lipstadt, a case immortalized last year in the film, “Denial.” Vick said he was highly concerned by the fact that “we don’t know how long this issue has been up, and it would’ve been nice if someone had noticed earlier.” He noted that having misinformation “like deniers being included in a list of legitimate scholars” readily available across the internet “certainly impacts Holocaust education.” Google press representatives did not respond to repeated requests for comment. In 2013, it was exposed that auto-fill suggestions on the search engine for “Jews should” included a host of disturbing antisemitic comments. Google subsequently edited that algorithm to exclude the most offensive statements from appearing in the auto-fill feature.

Image: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty By Katie Dupere2017-05-22 19:29:51 UTC When it comes to the Syrian refugee crisis, the world is looking for answers — literally. Google users around the globe are using the search engine to ask their more urgent questions about the conflict and refugees, and many people are searching for the same information. So Google and the United Nations decided to do something about it, creating a new platform to address frequently asked questions and offer some clarity. SEE ALSO: This gripping app lets you 'walk a mile' in a 16-year-old refugee girl's shoes The U.N. Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and Google on Monday launched Searching for Syria, an immersive website that gives audiences a visual and informative look into the Syrian refugee crisis. The website combines UNHCR data and stories with Google Search trends and Google Maps visuals, exploring the five most common questions people have about the crisis. "Searching for Syria aims to dispel myths and misconceptions about Syria and refugees, and provide an entirely fresh look at the biggest humanitarian tragedy of today," U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said in an in a statement.  Questions like "What is going on in Syria?" and "What was Syria like before the war?" are addressed through vivid photos, striking videos, and 360-degree images. "People are certainly trying to understand the scale of the crisis." The website is available in English, French, German, and Spanish to help reach millions of curious and concerned people around the world. An Arabic version of Searching for Syria will be released soon. "We see through Google Search trends that people are certainly trying to understand the scale of the crisis," William Usdin, project lead for Search for Syria, wrote in a blog post announcing the site. "Among the top trending searches in Germany, France, and the UK last year was, 'What is happening in Syria?' and simply, 'What is a refugee?'" Image: UNHCR As Searching for Syria explains, the conflict in Syria began after a series of peaceful protests in 2011. Before the war, more than 22 million people lived in Syria; now, more than half of those people have been forced from their homes. About 5 million have fled the country and live around the world as refugees. The remaining 6.3 million are internally displaced within Syria. More than 2 million Syrians have been killed or injured. Approximately 24,000 children have died. Life for survivors is anything but comfortable, with many coping with immeasurable trauma and life-altering displacement. In the past six years, Syria's children have collectively lost the equivalent of 24.5 million years of schooling. Millions of acres of farmland have been destroyed or abandoned, causing food prices to soar up to 900 percent. On Searching for Syria, an eerie clock counts how long the war has lasted, down to the second. Image: UNHCR The website also illuminates surprising facts about life in Syria before the war. In 2010, for example, Syria welcomed more tourists than Australia. In that same year, the top Google searches for the region were Arab Idol (the Arabic version of American Idol) , bodybuilding, summer fashion, and Miley Cyrus. One of the site's greatest contributions, however, is debunking myths and tackling stigma surrounding Syrian refugees. There's common rhetoric in the U.S., for example, that claims Syrian refugees have little to contribute to America and will be a burden on the country. But, as Searching for Syria points out, 18 in every 100 Syrian refugees living in the U.S. have an advanced degree. For U.S. citizens, that number is only 11 in every 100. When learning about the harrowing reality of Syrian refugees through Searching for Syria, many users will inevitably come to the same final question: "What can I do?" The website offers suggestions on how people can meaningfully help Syrian refugees, such as spreading awareness of the facts behind the crisis and donating to the work of UNHCR.  While these are just small steps in helping to address a huge problem, any action is vital — and that includes learning the facts behind the crisis.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 22 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman TechCrunch: ‘In the AI wars, Microsoft now has the clearer vision’ A week ago, Microsoft held its Build developer conference in its backyard in Seattle. This week, Google did the same in an amphitheater right next to its Mountain View campus. While Microsoft’s event felt like it embodied the resurgence of the company under the leadership of Satya Nadella, Google I/O — and especially its various, somewhat scattershot keynotes — fell flat this year. The two companies have long been rivals, of course, but now — maybe more than ever — they are on a collision course that has them compete in cloud computing, machine learning and artificial intelligence, productivity applications and virtual and augmented reality. It’s fascinating to compare Pichai’s and Nadella’s keynote segments. Both opened their respective shows. But while Pichai used his time mostly to announce new stats and a new product or two, Nadella instead used his time on stage to talk about the opportunities and risks of the inevitable march of technological progress that went way beyond saying that his company is now ‘AI first.’ “Let us use technology to bring more empowerment to more people,” Nadella said of one of the core principles of what he wants his company to focus on. “When we have these amazing advances in computer vision, or speech, or text understanding — let us use that to bring more people to use technology and to participate economically in our society.” And while Google mostly celebrated itself during its main I/O keynote, Nadella spent a good chunk of time during his segment on celebrating and empowering developers in a way that felt very genuine. Having spent a few days at both events, I couldn’t help coming home thinking that it may be Microsoft that has the more complete vision for this AI-first world we’ll soon live in — and if Google has it, it didn’t do a good job articulating it at I/O this year. AI First The area where this rivalry is most obvious (outside of the core cloud computing services) is in machine learning. Google CEO Sundar Pichai noted during his keynote segment that the company is moving from being a mobile first company to an AI first one. Microsoft is essentially on the same path, even as its CEO Satya Nadella phrased it differently. Neither company really mentioned the other during its keynote events, but the parallels here are pretty clear. The two marquee products both companies used to show off their AI prowess were surprisingly similar. For Microsoft, that was Story Remix, a very nifty app that automatically makes interesting home videos our of your photos and videos. For Google, it was Google Photos, which is using its machine learning tech to help you share your best photos more easily. Remix is a far more fun and interesting product, which garnered massive applause from the developer audience at Build, while the new Google Photos features sound useful enough, but aren’t going to blow people away. There was also nothing developers could learn from that segment. Google Lens, which can identify useful information in images, looks like it could be really useful, too (though we won’t really know until we get our hands on it at some point in the future), but it’s worth noting that Google’s presentation wasn’t very clear here and that a number of people I talked to after the event told me that they had a hard time figuring out whether this was a developer tool, a built-in feature for the Google Assistant or a standalone app. That’s never a good sign. Google also still offers Google Goggles, an app that allowed you to identify objects around you for a few years now. I think Google forgot that even existed, as it’s sometimes prone to do. At the core of the two companies’ AI efforts for consumers are Microsoft Cortana and the Google Assistant. This is one area where Google remains clearly ahead of Microsoft, simply because it offers more hardware surfaces for accessing it and because it knows more about the user (and the rest of the world). Cortana works well enough, but because it mostly lives on the desktop and isn’t really connected to the rest of your devices, using it never comes natural. In the virtual personal assistant arena, Google actually had some interesting announcements (though things like making calls on Google Home fell a bit flat, too, simply because Amazon announced this same feature for its Echo speakers a few days earlier). The fact that it is coming to the iPhone shows that Google wants it to be a cross-platform service and its integration with Chromecast is also really interesting (but again, because Amazon already announced its version of the Echo with a built-in screen, this didn’t land with the big splash Google had surely hoped for either). None of the new Assistant features are available now, which is disappointing and follows an unfortunate trend for Google I/O announcements in recent years. With the Microsoft Graph, it’s worth mentioning, Microsoft is now building a fabric that will tie all of your devices and applications together. Whether that will work as planned remains to be seen, but it’s a bold project that could have wide-reaching consequences for how you use Microsoft’s tools, even on Android, in the future. VR/AR/Real World Another topic both companies talked about at their events are virtual and augmented reality. Here, both Google and Microsoft are talking about the spectrum of experiences that sit between full augmented reality (or “mixed reality” as Microsoft calls it) and virtual reality (and at the other end of that is “real reality” in Google’s charts). With HoloLens, Microsoft has a clear lead in standalone augmented reality experiences. That’s a $3,000 device, though. Google’s current approach is different in that it want to use machine vision (combined with its Tango technology) to use phones as the prime lens for viewing AR experiences. As for VR, Google this year talked a lot about standalone headsets. Yet while it revealed a few partners, it remained vague about specs, prices and release dates. Microsoft, on the other hand, is currently focusing on tethered headsets from partners like Acer that combine some of its HoloLens technology for tracking your movements with the power of the connected Windows 10 PC. Microsoft is shipping dev kits now and consumers will be able to buy them later this year. It’s HoloLens, though, is technically miles ahead of anything Google even showed blueprints of at I/O. That’s a surprise, because Google had a lead in building a VR ecosystem thanks to its quirky Cardboard viewers, but now it feels like it’s at the risk of falling behind. Developer Conferences Both Microsoft and Google used their events to announce relatively evolutionary updates to their flagship operating systems. Google, of course, had already pre-announced Android O and Microsoft had already pre-announced that it’ll now offer two Windows 10 releases a year, so the fact that we’ll get a new update in the fall really wasn’t a surprise. For both companies, these developer shows are high-stakes events. Google I/O, however, felt pretty relaxed this year. Indeed, it almost felt as if I/O came at the wrong time of the year for the company. There simply wasn’t all that much to announce this year, it felt, and while that would’ve allowed Google to more clearly lay out its vision, it instead squandered valuable keynote time on talking about previously announced YouTube features that few people in the audience cared about. While Microsoft admittedly has a far wider product portfolio for developers, its event had far more energy and showed a clearer vision. Microsoft, too, made sure that its event focused almost exclusively on developers (“There will be coding on stage,” a Microsoft representative warned the assembled media before the first keynote). Google’s event (and especially the main keynote) often felt like the company didn’t quite know who its audience was (developers? consumers? the press?). And Google had a “developer keynote” at its developer conference. That must have been a first. When Microsoft showed off Remix at Build, it was to tell developers that they, too, can take the company’s tools and build an experience like this. When Google showed off Google Photos, it showed consumers that they can now use its technology to quickly make photo books. Yet really interesting new feature for developers, like Instant Apps, were barely mentioned in the keynote, even though they touch both consumers and developers. Yet the fact that the addition of Kotlin as a first-class language for Android development got more applause than any other announcement at the show clearly shows what the core audience is (in the press boxes, that announcement mostly resulted in blank stares, of course). So to be blunt, I/O was relativelyboring this year. There was no new hardware, no major new developer tools, no big new consumer product, very few new tools and almost no products that developers or consumers can use right now (and not even a full name for Android O). Maybe this kind of annual cadence for developer conferences simply doesn’t work anymore now that technology moves way too fast for annual updates, but it also remains the most effective tool to bring a developer ecosystem together under one roof (or tents, in Google’s case), state your case and lay out your vision. This year, Microsoft did a better job at that.

up next: now reading: Google Is Building the Future, and the New York Times Is Depressed Google Is Building the Future, and the New York Times Is Depressed By John Tamny May 23, 2017 X Story Stream recent articles Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Here’s a not-so-trick question: if technologically-gifted and offered the chance to develop those talents at Google or the federal government, which would you choose? The question is almost rhetorical it’s so simple.  Working at the Googleplex in Mountain View, CA allows the talented to develop ideas with some of the world’s greatest minds in concert with some of the cushiest corporate perks ever conceived.  So big is the fight for talent in Silicon Valley that even the area’s chefs are enjoying bidding wars for their services.  Google would be a pretty wondrous place to work, and all that’s previously been written ignores the handsome pay; pay that includes equity in one of the 21st century’s greatest growth stories.   The main thing is that talented people logically want to express those talents in the marketplace.  The good news is that they’re getting that chance.  Thanks to a surge of investor interest in Silicon Valley, companies like Google are, according to Farhad Manjoo of the New York Times, “funding the biggest, most world-changing things. They are spending on ideas that, years from now, we may come to see as having altered life for much of the planet.” Yet despite this happy development, Manjoo is downcast.  His concern, if readers can believe it, is that “the American government’s appetite for funding big things — for scientific research and out-of-this-world technology and infrastructure programs — keeps falling.” Manjoo contends that the latter “sets up a looming complication: Technology giants, not the government, are building the artificially intelligent future.” Let’s unpack Manjoo’s comments. For one, individuals who work in government don’t have six fingers on each hand, they don’t have blood types different from us civilians, nor does their employ by the federal government cause angelic qualities to magically enter their bodies.  To state what is a tautology, individuals who work in government used to not work in government.  They’re just like us, though some might reasonably point out that they’re less ambitious and less risk-oriented.  More than Manjoo would perhaps like to admit, government work is to some degree an expression of an individual’s personal makeup, including a desire to avoid the risk of job loss that so often defines real world employment. In short, the big thinkers, innovators and risk-takers don’t generally migrate to bureaucracy and pay grades.  Why then, would those who do be handed the money of others to pursue “world-changing things”? Ok, but the frequent reply from those prone to defending government’s role in shaping our technological future is that absent past government investment in research there would be no internet, nor would there be GPS technology that is more and more driving and shaping the “gig economy.” Back in 2013 Allan Sloan laughably contended that if not for federal research there’s “No Arpanet, no Internet. No Internet, no Amazon, no $25 billion personal fortune for Jeff Bezos.” No doubt some who should know better believe that if not for the Air Force, there would be no GPS technology either. Back to reality, the federal government created primitive and unmarketable versions of the internet and GPS.  More important, government didn’t create the internet or GPS as much resources always and everywhere extracted from the private sector led to advances that had no application in the marketplace.  Regarding GPS alone, it took years of private investment for navigational advances to reach the consumer in remotely affordable fashion.  And then it was entrepreneurial companies like Apple and Samsung that saw the value of inserting GPS into smartphones, only for other bright minds like Travis Kalanick to see the commercial possibilities of GPS technology on the way to Uber.  After that, for Sloan and others to suggest that we wouldn’t have GPS or the internet sans government experimentation is as silly as the suggestion that without federal infrastructure spending, we would be traveling by horseback from Los Angeles and San Francisco.  Sorry, but the private sector that gifted us with cars and airplanes would surely have divined traffic-free motorways absent government provision of that which is regularly choked.  Getting right to the point, and paraphrasing Sloan, without private sector wealth creation there are no roads, there’s no exciting technology to speak of, and surely no federal investment in same.  Only in the New York Times’ newsroom do government jobs simply exist, along with the ability of those in federal employ to spend a lot of money allegedly shaping the future.  Missed by Manjoo is that taxpayers have historically gone without to varying degrees so that federal workers could “tinker." Which brings us to a crucial aspect of technological advance that explains why the federal government’s attempts to shape the future are wholly counterproductive.  In the real world, failure, and lots of it, is what makes eventual success possible.  As Pixar founder Ed Catmull noted in his essential 2014 book Creativity, Inc., all movies produced inside the northern California studio “suck” at first.  Important about what starts out as awful is that Pixar employees race to realize their mistakes.  They have no choice but to do so in light of the shareholders they must please.  Of course it’s this desire to enrich their owners that forces feverish improvement of that which is initially much less than great. The above has forever defined technological advance in the real world.  Thomas Edison felt he’d had a good day if he’d experimented a great deal, only to err each time.  The failure was information crucial to eventual success.  More modernly, Jeff Bezos yearns for blockbuster product rollouts like the Echo since the winners fund lots of experimentation that will surely lead to lots of information-producing losers.  Government technologists can’t operate in the ways described given the basic truth that failure doesn’t inform their experimentation.  Leaving aside the talent deficits inside government bureaucracies, the bigger problem is that the endless inflow of the money of others means that governmental tinkering takes place minus the loss realization without which there can be no victories.  Somehow all of this is lost on Manjoo.  His conclusion is that “We would be wise to chip in — or let them take over the future for themselves.”  Translated, Manjoo proposes further fleecing of non-governmental workers so that those employed by Leviathan can experiment more.  Oh my, wouldn’t we all like free money to do what we want? Actually, not really, but that's another column.   Back once again to reality, if Google and other technologists in the private sector are going to build the future as Manjoo contends, wonderful.  Seemingly missed by Manjoo in a column full of misses is that all the life-enhancing advances are logically crafted in the private sector mainly because all capitalistic advance is preceded by the failure that rarely informs the oxymoron that is “government investment.” Manjoo laments that big technology companies are set to author “the biggest, most world-changing things.” What he doesn't see in his eternal confusion is that he would be stating the obvious whether the federal government invested hundreds of billions each year in technology, or much better, nothing at all.  John Tamny is editor of RealClearMarkets, a Senior Fellow in Economics at Reason Foundation, and a senior economic adviser to Toreador Research and Trading (www.trtadvisors.com).

Image: Google. Alongside Google’s annual developer conference last week, the company held its fourth annual I/O Youth event at the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, CA. Neary 150 students in grades 5-7 from around the Bay Area participated in activities that focused on digital storytelling, science and computer science (CS), according to a company blog post. The event was emceed by leadership at Google's Doodle team and Technovation, a global entrepreneurship program for girls.  First, the participating students played around with Toontastic, an iOS and Android app-based game that allows kids to create their own 3D cartoons. Students can “draw, animate and narrate swashbuckling adventures, breaking news stories, science reports and all your other wacky ideas,” according to the Toontastic website. In the process of bringing their stories and characters to life, users can develop digital storytelling skills. Toontastic works on phones, tablets and some Chromebooks; it works offline and is free to download. Students spent time on another app called Science Journal for an experiment that tasked them with building a wind spinner from craft supplies and calculating wind speed. Google worked with the Imagination Foundation to develop the free app, which has hundreds of thousands of downloads in the Google Play Store. With Science Journal, students can record and document information like wind speed using a smartphone’s sensor data. On the coding side, attendees were introduced to the Google CS First curriculum, a framework used by more than 4,600 CS First clubs nationwide. The curriculum takes a block-based approach to teaching CS with Scratch, a free programming language developed by MIT’s Media Lab. Students also developed a hot potato game using the littleBits Code Kit by littleBits. The set employs Google’s Blockly educational games. Participants each left with a littleBits Rule Your Room Kit, the blog post said. Lastly, the event gave the students a dose of immersive educational experiences, taking students on a virtual field trip with Expeditions. Additionally, Google familiarized them with artificial intelligence (AI), demoing Google Assistant and games from Google’s A.I. Experiments project that aims to inspire everyone to start tinkering with machine learning. Learn more about the event on the Google blog.

The Google Home app now features customizable user-defined shortcuts for Assistant Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/05/17 2:03pm PDTMay 17, 2017 20 Plus 1 on G+ 65 Share on Facebook 38 Share on Twitter Total Shares123 Applications Google News One of the draws of having a personal assistant is being able to control various things through it. Alexa is popular partially for this reason and Google Home/Assistant has been slowly catching up since its launch. Just a few weeks ago, our very own Cody noticed that Google was implementing direct support for IFTTT in the Google app for user-defined actions. Well, this has finally appeared in the Home app in a "Shortcuts" menu in the Assistant section. These customizable user-defined shortcuts are very basic and anyone familiar with IFTTT will feel right at home (heh). The trigger is the "Ok Google, [blank]" phrase that you define, which activates a service like opening Google Play Music or sending a specific text to a certain contact. The best part? Not having to use the IFTTT website to manage your applets.   If you haven't taken up Tasker/AutoVoice/Assistant yet, this is a good way to get started. I am not sure if this is a server-side switch or an app update (I only noticed it this afternoon), but it's super cool nonetheless.

Interesting! But no IFTTT account required I guess, because I created a Todoist shortcut and didn't see any applets added to my IFTTT account on the web. Plus, invoking the shortcut just opens up the Todoist chat interface within the Assistant app, where it takes me through the normal workflow. Jordan Palmer Same. bozzykid Are we sure it is actually using IFTTT? Perhaps they just used ifttt in the UI elements since it is copying their features. XerBlade Considering all this is really doing is remapping Assistant commands to custom phrases (so it can't be used to do anything Assistant can't already do natively, plus you can't give it any variable phrases), I'm pretty sure this has absolutely nothing to do with IFTTT. Seriously, this does one thing and one thing only. You say one custom phrase, and it remaps it to a different phrase and acts as if you said that. tu3218 I just tried this and I don't get it. I selected the voice triggers but I don't see anywhere to actually select the service and the devices that I want to activate based on my command. What am I missing? Alex S it's literally just sending the command directly to assistant, just like if you said it outloud. It's just a way to shorten the command. tu3218 Hmm okay. I tried one and it worked. I see there's an option to turn up the TV. But it said I hadn't linked my Harmony account yet. I went to add devices but don't see Harmony. Seems like we're making progress. bozzykid Harmony is already available at least in the US. tu3218 Nothing here on my end. I am in the US. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7ac7833390bcfeeef1844da6dbc20fc821f9a520d1b90b7b52c870faa3fcf10d.jpg bozzykid You are looking in the wrong place. Its under Assistant Apps. It has been available for months. create812 "It's just a way to shorten the command." This is the real take away here. Alex S A few things: A) It's SUPER specific and only recognizes the EXACT phrase you say. For example if you put "Good night" but assistant picks it up as "goodnight" it won't work. B) You can map multiple key phrases to one action but you cannot match multiple actions to one (or more) key phrases. Not sure why? This actually kind of sucks, because there's really no point to using shortcuts if you can't have multiple actions in one key phrase. Otherwise, why not just ask Google Assistant what you want directly? C) Is the menu broken for anyone else? If I switch to a different app then switch back to the Google Home at it duplicates the examples so the list gets twice as long, then three times, etc. Weird! bozzykid It also only recognizes commands formatted properly. If I have "Ask harmony..." it fails but if I input it as "Ask Harmony..." it works fine. Alex S yea that doesn't bug me as much as some of the other stuff like not being able to do two commands at once. don't really see what the point of this is right now? it's cool you can make commands shorter, though. bozzykid It is great for Harmony because saying "Hey Google, Ask Harmony to turn up the volume" is a bit ridiculous. At least I might actually use my Home for Harmony commands now. Amandafpotter Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Midnitte "The trigger is the "Ok Google, [blank]" phrase that you define, which activates a service like opening Google Play Music or sending a specific text to a certain contact. The best part? Not having to use the IFTTT website to manage your applets." When are they going to add the reverse? I want to be able to trigger the command "Hey Google, catch me up" remotely from something like dismissing my alarm. :/ Any other solution is either too convoluted, clunky, or unreliable. Austin Spangrud Biggest issue that I have is the response back from Google assistant. I have my garage door setup so when I state open garage door, assistant responds with ok opening garage door. But since my garage door is set up as a switch it says turning off garage door. I just want a custom response back. Dammit Google!! Ifttt will let me do it! Jason Creating a custom response is so much fun especially when showing off your little toy to your friends. Alfonso Surroca Sounds like IFTTT is still superior to Shortcuts, since you're able to write custom OK Google responses. "Turning off garage door" sounds annoying. Paulo I have also added: "open my garage door" and "close my garage door" to control my momentary switch so that I do not have to say "turn on my garage door" whenever I want to open or close the door. Seems to work very well but nothing truly amazing other than adding different ways to speak your default command. I must say my brain finds the verbiage much more appealing. Michael Rodgers I'm a bit confused. These settings are in Assistant, but they're only to be used in Google Home? iantrich No, any instance of Google Assistant. Google Home just happens to be the app that has such settings Chronocento Does this work with third party actions? Like, can you bind "OK Google, ask AutoVoice [something]" to "Ok Google, do [something]"? iantrich Yes. One of their examples is for the Harmony 3rd party action João Dias Yes, actually! :) Check here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lPWf-KR9M Chronocento Uao, a reply from João himself! :D Thanks for your great work, I love your AutoApps!!! create812 Anyone else notice how this year's I/O roll outs have gone much smoother and quicker than years past? I'm running Android O beta with little fuss, and have access to features as I hear about them (including these Assistant shortcuts). These are good times. Jerry Palmer How do I share shortcuts and home devices with other users? I have a bunch of shortcuts set up for Harmony. However, my wife is unable to activate them with her voice because we have multiple users setup and none of the shortcuts or home control devices show up in the Home app or Google Assistant for her. Tj Hariharan Google needs to powerup their voice commands, they can so easily make it more powerful than IFTTT - by offering up a way to one one-to-many or many-to-one voice commands and some automations as well. Heck home automation could be built into android and assistant. (things like location and time of day etc). As it stands IFTTT still can't do "if i'm home AND it's after sunset turn my lights on".

Cites weekly gathering at which Alphabet executives answer questions as key Alphabet strength. Financial crisis may have been different if Wall Street firms were run with that level of transparency, she says. John Shinal | @johnshinal 12 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES Adam Jeffery | CNBC Ruth Porat, CFO of Alphabet, at the New York Economic Club on May 22, 2017. Ruth Porat, the former veteran Morgan Stanley executive who's now chief financial officer of Alphabet, suggested Monday that the financial crisis could have been prevented -- or at least made less severe -- if Wall Street had operated with the same transparency as Google's parent company. "The financial crisis would have been different if someone had asked" whether taking on massive amounts of financial leverage was a good idea for the big banks, Porat told a luncheon gathering of the Economic Club of New York. "Culture is more important than rules and regulations" in its contribution to the long-term success of a company, said Porat, who worked at Morgan Stanley for 28 years before joining Google in 2015. "The most important thing is culture," she said. Porat pointed to a long-time management tool used by Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page as key to why Google has continued to steadily boost sales and profits for more than a decade. Every Friday at a company-wide, town-hall style meeting, the executives must answer a question that employees have selected through a vote. The sessions, known as TGIF gatherings, are "not always pleasant," Porat said. But "even though it's unpleasant, it can be hugely valuable," she said, because "it increases productivity and gives everyone a voice," Porat said. "If banks had that kind of system, the financial crisis would have played out very differently." The most important lesson she took away from the financial crisis of 2008-2009 was that companies need to focus on their "source of greatest vulnerability," she said during an interview with Maria Bartiromo, global markets editor of Fox Business Network. On Wall Street, that vulnerability was liquidity. When banks became over-leveraged and liquidity dried up, the resulting freeze nearly brought down the U.S. financial system. For Alphabet, the greatest source of vulnerability is the speed of global innovation. "Competition is one click away," she said. "Innovation happens everywhere...you better have a culture asking for a voice." Part of Google's culture is that "we like all forms of engineering except financial engineering," Porat said, in explaining why the company -- unlike many other technology firms -- includes stock-based compensation in its operating results. Porat is widely credited with bringing financial discipline to Alphabet. Since she was named the company's CFO on March 25, 2015, the company's shares have climbed 70 percent, versus a 25 percent rise in the Nasdaq Composite Index. Separately, Porat also said that she doesn't see the company's YouTube unit creating the same types of original shows as other tech rivals, including Netflix and Amazon, who are spending big on Hollywood-style content. "We have a differentiated asset in our (YouTube) content creators. We don't see going to shows with glitzy production values that others have." John ShinalTechnology Reporter for CNBC.com

Name: Subject: Message: Mophie finally offers its Juice Pack battery case for the Google Pixel XL Newsby John Callaham12 hours ago 5 193 15 Just a few days ago, Mophie launched its Juice Pack battery cases for the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus. However, it took a bit longer for the company to do the same for the Google Pixel XL. Today, Mophie announced the availability of the battery case for Google’s flagship phone, several months after the Pixel XL first went on sale. See also: Problems with the Google Pixel and Pixel XL and how to fix them 2 weeks ago The Juice Pack includes a 2,950 mAh built-in battery that Mophie says will extend the total talk time on a Pixel XL to over 50 hours. The design of the case includes internal rubberized support pads that are supposed to keep the phone safe from falls and drops, along with raised corners for protection against any scratched displays or cracked screens. Charging the Pixel XL with the Mophie case, via a USB Type-C cable, will charge the phone first, and then the case. You can also charge the case with any Qi-based wireless charging pad. It also has magnetic mounts that are designed to keep your phone in place when it charges up. The LED power indicator on the back can be used to check the current battery level or its charge status. Finally, the case has forward-facing speaker ports, which will allow any sounds from the phone’s main speaker to be amplified and redirected out to the front of the case. The Mophie Juice Pack case for the Pixel XL is priced at $99.95, and is now available on the company’s website. It can also be bought at the retail store locations of Verizon Wireless, which has the US carrier exclusive for the phone.

Since Google moved from Moscone West in San Francisco, to the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, they have made the event much larger than before. In fact what’s interesting about the Shoreline Amphitheater is that the majority of Google I/O – including the Sandboxes, other stages and such – are in the parking lots outside of the actual venue. But having a much larger venue for Google I/O means that Google is able to invite many more press to the event, as well as bring in more developers. I went to Google I/O in 2015, the last year they were at Moscone West, and compared to 2017 at the Shoreline Amphitheater, Google I/O has become a much larger beast. As it does every year, Google I/O began day one with a keynote hosted by the company’s CEO, Sundar Pichai. The keynote was scheduled to be about 90 minutes but ended up being closer to two hours. That’s still shorter than it had been in previous years (some being over 3 hours long). Google decided to take out a lot of the more developer-focused announcements from the main keynote and have a separate developer keynote after lunch on the first day. This was likely aimed at the press, as a lot of the developer announcements do go over our head. But it also gave everyone a chance to run out and use the bathroom, and grab lunch before coming back for the second keynote. The keynote had plenty of announcements, but of course the big theme was artificial intelligence and machine learning. Google, as expected, announced some new features and API’s for Google Assistant. For starters, the demo that Google used was the fact that you can talk to Panera and order your food through Google Assistant and have it delivered, without even going to Panera’s website. With Google Assistant, they also made it easier to find apps and services that work with Google Assistant, similar to what Alexa has with her Skills section in her app. Probably one of the more overlooked announcements in Google Assistant is the fact that you can now type to the assistant, instead of always speaking to it. Making it easier to use without the whole world knowing what you’re saying. And of course, Google Assistant came to the iPhone. Android Go was another big part of the keynote. It’s basically looking to be the next evolution of Android One. Instead of Google working with manufacturers to make cheaper handsets running stock Android, they are making Android leaner for these lower-end devices. Android Go is made to run on devices with as little as 1GB of RAM, by making many parts of the OS more lightweight and they even have many of the larger apps available for Android Go which are more lightweight and use less resources, making it great for these cheaper devices. This is the continuation of Google looking to reach the next billion users. Google did also mention that there are now 2 billion people using Android around the world. Considering there are just over 7 billion people in the world, that’s a pretty significant number of people using Android. After the keynote, the huge crowd of people exited the Amphitheater and headed out to get some lunch. Afterwards, many started hitting up the many sandboxes, which were in these huge tents in the parking lot. One of the more interesting demos was the Android + Audi and Android + Volvo demos. Basically, Audi and Volvo had taken Android Auto and turned it into a full-fledged infotainment system for their respective vehicles. So instead of taking your phone to your car and plugging it in, you are simply interacting with an Android interface, but with a skin on top. In fact, most people likely wouldn’t even know it was Android. But it does all the usual things you’d expect. Like streaming music, navigating and much more. Now that wasn’t all for Android Auto. They were also showing off Waze on Android Auto, which is going to be launching in Beta “soon.” There was no word on when exactly. But it’ll be an option for Android Auto users, instead of having to stick with Google Maps. And finally, the ability to use Android Auto wirelessly. So that means over Bluetooth instead of plugging in your smartphone. This is actually not as simple as it sounds, as it needs to be enabled by Google’s partners (so Pioneer, Audi, Ford, Chevrolet, etc), and it won’t be enabled for everyone when it’s complete. Google Assistant was also shown off in the Sandboxes this year. They were showing it off on different devices like the Pixel, LG G6, Samsung Galaxy S8 and even the iPhone. They were also showing developers how they can get started with Actions on Google Assistant and make their app work with Assistant. Speaking of Google Assistant, Deeplocal was there showing off their project they made with the Assistant SDK – It’s Mocktails Mixer. Basically, inside there is a Raspberry Pi that has the Assistant installed and it mixes and pours you a drink. Now the cool thing here is that the Assistant will get better over time thanks to Machine Learning, but you can also set it up to pour specific drinks, and even add your own jokes to it. One of my favorite jokes that Deeplocal had added was “what did the C++ programmer say to the C Programmer? You have no class,” that’s a joke that developers will really only get though. Rounding out day one, Google had quite a few things happening “After Hours.” There was plenty of food to go around, with different cuisine available as well. There was a Comedy Club, a VR Drive-In, a pizza party and a few other fun events going on once it got dark at Google I/O. It was a good way for everyone to relax and still have some fun at Google I/O before heading back to their hotels for the night, and before day two got underway. Speaking of day two, that kicked off with the AR/VR Keynote in the morning. This is where Clay Bavor, who’s the head of Google’s virtual reality ambitions, took the stage and talked about the future of both Tango and Daydream. He reiterated a lot of points that were mentioned in the first keynote. But this keynote did also mention that Daydream 2.0 is coming later this fall. And in this update, Google Cast support is coming, as well as Chrome, among other things. On the AR side of things, the ASUS ZenFone AR is making its way to store shelves this summer, and hitting Verizon in the fall. The rest of the day was mostly full of different sessions and such, with the Android Fireside chat capping things off for the day. The Android Fireside chat is where people – usually developers – can come in and ask the Googlers that work on Android some questions about the platform, but they won’t talk about the future, as those things can change, and often do. Some of the questions were in regards to Kotlin, but they did also mention that now graphics drivers can be updated through the Google Play Store, which can be a pretty big deal – especially since a lot of security issues have been due to graphics drivers in recent security patches. The second day capped off with lots of food, as well as a concert by Holy Ghost and LCD SoundSystem. It was a great time at the Shoreline Amphitheater, at Google I/O 2017. But while you’re in Mountain View, and literally right next to the Googleplex, you can’t not make the walk over there. It’s about a 10-15 minute walk from the Shoreline Amphitheater, and definitely worth it. Google’s campus is massive (and they are actually under construction as they are adding onto the campus) as expected. With lots of cool looking Android statues. Last year, Google moved the Android Statues over to the Visitor Center Beta and the Google Merchandise Store. Inside the Google Merchandise Store, you’ll find just about anything with a Google logo on it. From t-shirts, to hoodies, to pens, to backpacks, and even dog toys. The prices are actually not too bad, I was expecting a slight markup, with them being Google merchandise. It was another great show for Google at their annual developers conference, and according to many that attended in 2016, the infrastructure was much larger this year (making less room for the sea of people to get around), and it was also much better put together, instead of just a mess – especially when it came to logistics. Sure there weren’t a lot of consumer-focused announcements at Google I/O this year, but that is also to be expected, since Google I/O is actually a developers conference and not a regular press conference. But it is still nice to see announcements like Android O, Android Go, Daydream and more.

By Jared Newman5 minute Read Amazon Echo and Google Home would like your attention now. Or at least they will in the near future. advertisement The two tech giants have both recently announced proactive notifications for their connected speakers. Instead of just listening for commands, Echo and Home will soon light up when they have something to say. Users can then ask about what they missed and get notifications read to them by Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa. If you’ve ever been overwhelmed by notifications on your phone, the idea of yet another device begging for attention probably sounds like a nightmare. But with devices like Home and Echo, Google and Amazon have an opportunity to rethink how notifications ought to work in the first place. This is their chance to reduce distractions instead of creating more of them, and deliver only the information that matters. Let’s hope they don’t squander it. The Need For Notifications The desire for proactive notifications on connected speakers is understandable, especially from the perspective of developers making skills for these devices. Huy Nguyen, a software developer at ChefSteps, says notifications would finally allow the company’s Joule sous vide cooker to tell users when the water is heated, when the food is ready, or if there’s a problem with the cooker. Right now, all users can do is walk through recipes and start the cooking process. “We can’t close the loop on a lot of things,” Nguyen says. “It’s not a full conversation without that.” ChefSteps should be able to add those alerts later this year, when Amazon opens up notifications to all Alexa skill developers. (In the near term, Amazon is limiting notifications to a handful of services, including AccuWeather, The Washington Post, Just Eat, and Life360.) Nguyen is also pondering other notification-driven features, such as alerting family members via Alexa when dinner is ready, or asking how they’d like their food cooked. A Time And A Place But while notifications may be useful on devices like Amazon Echo and Google Home, they introduce new complications that don’t exist on smartphones. On a phone, for instance, you can scan through a long list of notifications to decide which ones need immediate attention. That same process would be a waste of time on a voice-driven device like the Echo, which could make you spend minutes running through a list of unimportant alerts. advertisement “It would be smart to allow certain types of notifications, or maybe approve notifications, because no one wants a firehose of stuff,” ChefSteps’ Nguyen says. For now, Amazon and Google have devised crude solutions to this problem: Amazon will require users to opt into notifications for each skill, so they can select just the ones they really want. And Google is starting off with just a handful of high-priority notifications, including flight status, traffic updates, and reminders. Neither approach will be sustainable in the long run. Google will inevitably want to support a broader range of notifications, and Amazon’s all-or-nothing approach isn’t flexible enough. You might, for instance, want to hear a breaking news update from the Washington Post in the evening, but not in the morning when you’re trying to get out the door. A set of flashing lights just isn’t enough to tell you whether you’re being alerted to something important–like traffic on your morning commute–or something that can wait until later. To really deal with this issue, Amazon and Google will need to get smarter about how and when to deliver different notifications. That could mean dividing them into categories and withholding certain types of notifications at times, or waiting for a conversation to happen before interjecting with some related information. Rohit Nadhani, the CEO and cofounder of an email service called Newton, sees the Echo’s Flash Briefing as an opportunity for those kinds of conversations to emerge. If users are already asking about the news and the weather, for instance, it might make sense for a service like Newton to offer a summary of some important emails. “Amazon has announced publicly that they are going to let you do notifications, and then the natural progression there will let me latch onto their daily summary as well,” he says. Putting notifications on a stationary device like the Echo or Google Home also presents some major challenges around location and access. If a user has multiple Alexa or Google Assistant devices around the house–or in other places like their car–should a notification appear on all of them? And how should notifications work on a device with multiple user accounts, such as Google Home? Solving these problems will require a lot more intelligence about where users are and what they’re doing, so that developers can determine where to deliver a notification. advertisement “Right now, we don’t have that information, and I think it’s going to be something they’ll have to solve eventually,” Nguyen says. Less Is More As Amazon and Google figure out timing and delivery for notifications, they should also set guidelines on content. The goal should not be to duplicate the types of alerts people get on their phones, but to summarize and allow for quick action if necessary. “I think fundamentally, Alexa or Google Home notifications are going to be much smarter than mobile notifications,” Nadhani says. “On mobile email notifications, you get notified for every email, or every email in a specific account, and I think that’s a bit too intrusive for an assistant like Google Home or Alexa.” For Newton, Nadhani is envisioning a system that looks through an inbox for important information, and then provides quick summaries or reminders. A device like the Echo, for instance, might provide a nudge if an important client hasn’t responded to your email after a while. And when you’re listening to your daily summary, Newton might chime in with a list of meeting requests or incoming packages. Both Nadhani and Nguyen acknowledge that it’s early days for the concept of voice-driven notifications. Amazon hasn’t released any extensive documentation for notifications on Alexa, and Google hasn’t revealed any sort of developer program for Home’s proactive features. But as the two companies race to one-up each other in the virtual assistant wars, they’ll need to be careful not to gloss over their underlying challenges. Otherwise, they’ll miss their shot to reduce notification overload. “I think there are some really hard problems that need to be solved around how to control these things without holding developers down, without slowing us down,” Nguyen says. “I think it’s in their best interest to solve that before they just totally open it to the wild west, because if people turn off notifications right from the get-go, that whole experience is cut off.” About the author Jared Newman covers apps and technology for Fast Company from his remote outpost in Cincinnati.

(Gary Reyes/ Bay Area News Group) By Patrick May | pmay@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group PUBLISHED: May 22, 2017 at 8:17 am | UPDATED: May 22, 2017 at 4:44 pm When it comes to that one corner of the country that harbors the most desirable companies to work for, a new LinkedIn study says the answer is obvious: The tech-heavy, job-rich, hipper-than-ever San Francisco Bay Area. At the top of the heap is Google parent company Alphabet in Mountain View. But it’s joined by 10 other Bay Area-based firms, most of them tech leaders, to claim over half of the top 20 spots on the list. The survey, which also lays out the most desirable companies in Great Britain, India, Australia, France, Brazil and Germany, lists 50 U.S. firms that span 21 industries and employ 3.3 million workers.The data was collected by looking at LinkedIn’s more than 500 million members and studying their individual actions — what companies they applied to, which firms’ employees they reached out to for networking, and how long they stayed at a given workplace. Here’s at look at four of the locally based firms where everybody wants to work these days and why, according to the data-crunchers at LinkedIn: Alphabet (No. 1) The headquarters: Mountain View The workforce (globally): 72,000 The draw: Known as the mothership of world-changing search engine Google, Alphabet’s corporate culture has long led the way in making the workplace fun. But the real draw, according to the survey, is the opportunities Alphabet offers workers to take on huge and challenging assignments in an intensely innovative and collaborative environment. The boss’s take: “My job as a leader is to make sure everybody in the company has great opportunities, and that they feel they’re having a meaningful impact and are contributing to the good of society,” then-Google CEO Larry Page told Fortune in 2012. “As a world, we’re doing a better job of that. My goal is for Google to lead, not follow that.” The other thing to know: Google set a long-term goal in 2012 to use 100 percent renewable energy for its operations. It’s on track to hit that goal this year. Facebook (No. 3) The headquarters: Menlo Park The workforce: 17,000 The draw: Thanks in large part to its sheer girth as a social-media behemoth, Facebook’s 1.9-billion-strong user base offers its workers one heck of a drawing board to try out new ideas and, yes, change the world in ways not imaginable just a few years ago. The boss’s take: “Facebook is not a company for everyone in the world,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg once said. “The most important thing is to keep your team as small as possible. [Facebook] serves more than a billion people around the world, but our team has fewer than 10,000 people.” The other thing to know: The most popular jobs at Facebook these days include software engineering, infrastructure, machine learning, data analytics and marketing. Salesforce (No. 4) The headquarters: San Francisco The workforce: 25,000 The draw: The cloud-computing giant enlisted the counsel of Buddhist monks on the design of its new HQ, an instant icon on the San Francisco skyline and in the spirit of inclusion the company set aside the 61st floor for employee and community events. In addition, Salesforce has been a leader in ensuring equal compensation across gender, race and ethnicity, investing $3 million last year and another $3 million in April to make sure men and women throughout the company were equitably compensated for their work. The boss’s take: “My job,”  CEO Marc Benioff told the Huffington Post in 2015, “is to make sure that women are treated 100% equally at Salesforce in pay, opportunity and advancement.” The other thing to know: Salesforce recently introduced six months of parental leave for primary caregivers in the U.S. Uber (No. 5) The headquarters: San Francisco The workforce: 12,000 The draw: Why would anyone in their right mind want to join a company run by a controversy magnet like Travis Kalanick in a workplace beset by charges of sexual harassment? Because, as one expert told LinkedIn, landing a job at Uber is like making a splashy entrance in one’s budding career. “Most of the people who work at Uber see it is as a means to an end,” said HR expert Josh Bersin. “They want to work there because the company is well-known and will propel them to the next step.” The boss’s take: (in response to criticism he’s running a messed-up workplace): “I must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up,” Kalanick wrote in an email to staff. “I need leadership help and I intend to get it.” The other thing to know: New employees are asked to subscribe to 14 core company values, including making bold bets, being “obsessed” with the customer, and “always be hustlin”’     Tags:  Amazon Apple Google Jobs LinkedIn Uber Patrick May Patrick May is an award-winning writer for the Bay Area News Group working with the business desk as a general assignment reporter.

Senior House Republican Marsha Blackburn (Tenn.) on Friday introduced the BROWSER Act, which would require all internet service providers and web companies to obtain consumers' consent before using their web browsing history and location data to target ads. The BROWSER acroynym stands for Balancing the Rights of Web Surfers Equally and Responsibly. Blackburn is the chair of the House telecommunications subcommittee. "For internet investors this is scary stuff indeed," Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, said in a report. Paul Gallant, an analyst at Cowen & Co., says it's unlikely the bill will become law. Gallant, though, says the BROWSER Act  "bears watching given the implications for Facebook and Google in particular." The Obama administration's Federal Communications Commission in 2016 approved new consumer data privacy rules that applied to ISPs such as AT&T (T), Comcast (CMCSA) and Verizon Communications (VZ). Following Donald Trump's election as president, a Republican-led FCC in March voted to prevent the privacy rules from fully taking effect. Republicans aim to have the Federal Trade Commission oversee privacy issues. "By proposing legislation that would return ISP privacy jurisdiction to the FTC under an opt-in standard that would apply to Google and Facebook as well, Representative Blackburn, along with co-sponsors Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) and Bill Flores (R-Tex.), has introduced an entirely new — and potentially devastating — regulatory risk for internet edge providers." Moffett said. Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google and Facebook garner the most digital advertising revenue. IBD'S TAKE: Google stock has shot up 20% in 2017 and is no longer in a buy range, trading well above its 50-day moving average. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup. AT&T and Comcast last year charged that the privacy rules would put them at a disadvantage vs. internet firms such as Google and Facebook. Google, in a regulatory filing in early October, asked the FCC to back off, but the agency approved the new rules. Cowen's Gallant says that the new BROWSER bill would forbid any company, including both ISPs and internet firms, from denying service to consumers that do not opt in to tracking. "If the bill gets traction, this 'no denial of service' provision will be a flash point, as it would upend the longstanding compact for services like Facebook and Google — users get a free service in exchange for the company monetizing via tracking," Gallant said.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 22 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Wickfire, LLC and Co-Owners Chet Hall and Jonathan Brown Found Guilty of Intentional Interference with TriMax Media’s Business An Austin based jury unanimously found that Wickfire, LLC and its co-owners, Chet Hall and Jonathan Brown, intentionally interfered with TriMax Media’s business, but the jury failed to award damages. TriMax has filed a notice of appeal regarding the lack of damages awarded as well as other portions of the jury verdict. The case was tried in the Western District of Texas, styled as Civil Action No. 14-CV-34. The lawsuit centered around Google AdWords, an online-auction platform where companies like TriMax and Wickfire compete for advertising space. TriMax argued Wickfire intentionally interfered with TriMax’s contracts by (1) paying kickbacks to merchant representatives; (2) impersonating TriMax by placing unauthorized ads that plagiarized TriMax’s ad copy and contained other identifying information of TriMax; (3) repeatedly clicking on TriMax ads in order to artificially increase TriMax’s costs (known as “click fraud”); and (4) using an automated software program to manipulate the Google AdWords auction system to inflate TriMax’s costs (known as “bid jamming”).  At trial, a financial expert testified that due to Wickfire’s intentional interference over the past five years, TriMax’s damages exceeded $22 million. TriMax presented evidence to the jury that Wickfire had been suspended from over 200 Google AdWords accounts, violated merchant terms, and employed fake user agents and proxies to conceal its identity. The jury also saw evidence that Google referred to Wickfire as “Known Fraudsters” and that Wickfire registered the domain name “GoogleClickFraud.com”. TriMax also presented evidence regarding Wickfire’s destruction of evidence. TriMax learned that during the litigation, Wickfire wiped all the data from its Chief Technology Officer’s laptop, and then failed to disclose that information to TriMax or the court. Once TriMax uncovered the destruction, Wickfire claimed it was necessary, since the laptop had been stolen during a home burglary. However, the police report—which TriMax obtained independently after Wickfire failed to produce a copy—contradicted Wickfire’s story by mentioning nothing about an allegedly stolen laptop. While the jury heard extensive evidence about Wickfire’s conduct comprising the intentional interference, some of the most devastating evidence was excluded. For example, the jury was not permitted to see: The police report from the burglary; Registration documents showing Wickfire as the owner of “BitchesOfFacebook.com” and “PokeBitches.com”; An e-mail from a merchant representative who, after refusing to accept the alleged kickbacks, referred to Wickfire as “criminals”; Screenshots of Wickfire’s ads impersonating TriMax’s; An e-mail from a merchant terminating TriMax after wrongly believing TriMax was the source of the impersonating ads; An e-mail from a merchant complaining that Wickfire violated trademark terms and plagiarized TriMax’s ads; A lengthy technical report that, according to a world-renowned computer expert, proves conclusively that Wickfire committed extensive click fraud against TriMax; A real-time video demonstrating the bid-jamming TriMax experienced; A summary of hundreds of TriMax’s merchant contracts interfered with by bid-jamming; and E-mails from other competitors of Wickfire complaining about Wickfire’s bidding tactics. Despite the jury’s finding against Wickfire, Hall and Brown for intentional interference, no damages were awarded. A post-trial order reasoned the jury might have believed that Wickfire thought its bidding tactics did not violate Google policies. However, the jury was not permitted to see the actual Google policies at issue or hear testimony from the computer expert that Google’s policies prohibit gaming the AdWords auction. TriMax also brought defamation claims against Wickfire, Chet Hall and Jonathan Brown for telling third parties that TriMax committed click fraud. TriMax denied the allegations. Among TriMax’s key exculpatory evidence was the testimony of a third-party suspect who, in response to a question about whether she committed click fraud, pleaded the Fifth Amendment. However, the jury was precluded from seeing additional evidence about this third party, including e-mails in which she used a false identity to communicate with Wickfire. The jury found Wickfire and its co-owners published the statements about TriMax, but again, failed to award TriMax any damages. At trial, Wickfire received additional adverse rulings. The jury ruled against Wickfire on its request for damages on its claim for violation of the Lanham Act. The jury further ruled against Wickfire on its request for exemplary damages. Finally, Wickfire was denied its request for pre-judgment interest. Prior to trial, Wickfire filed multiple discovery motions, which were dismissed, and a motion for summary judgment on TriMax’s claims, which was denied. Wickfire also brought claims against TriMax for injury to business reputation, business disparagement, defamation, unfair competition, and misappropriation. However, Wickfire dropped each of those claims prior to the start of trial. TriMax will be appealing to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and will be asking for, among other things, a new trial to determine the amount of damages resulting from the intentional interference the jury found Wickfire, Hall and Brown committed against TriMax.   Leading the charge for TriMax will be nationally-renowned appellate attorney, Sidney K. Powell. Ms. Powell was formerly an Assistant United States Attorney and is author of the groundbreaking book Licensed to Lie, an exposé on unethical attorney conduct and improper concealment of evidence. Ms. Powell has served as lead counsel in more than 500 appeals in the Fifth Circuit, resulting in more than 180 published opinions. Although statistically, the Fifth Circuit reverses only approximately 15% of its cases, Ms. Powell publishes a record of succeeding in reversing more than 70% of the cases in which she has represented and sought reversal. TriMax’s CEO, Laura Woodruff, commented: “We’re thrilled Ms. Powell has agreed to lead the fight against Wickfire. Given Ms. Powell’s unmatched experience and record of accomplishment at the Fifth Circuit, along with the fact she only accepts few select cases, we have every reason to expect she will deliver a complete victory. Once the smoke clears, we are confident our efforts in this litigation will culminate in an award of damages to TriMax for the interference the jury found against Wickfire and TriMax’s complete exoneration as to Wickfire’s claims.” About TriMax Media: Founded in 2003, TriMax Media is a digital marketing agency specializing in performance-based search engine marketing. TriMax served on the first Google Advertiser Research Council and was one of the first companies to generate over one million leads for its clients utilizing Google AdWords.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 22 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman MaxGroup Media Launches to Dominate Digital Marketing for Clients and to Redefine Branding “If you don’t have an internet SEO strategy and mobile optimized presence today, you simply don’t have a business, or won’t have one for much longer.” – Mark Skovron, Ph.D., Author | Digital Branding Expert | CEO SURPRISE, AZ – 22 May, 2017 – Your Digital Footprint on Google, Yahoo and Bing determine a greater portion of your business income today more than ever before and that’s not going to change.  You must make it easy for customers to find you and do business with you on the web. MaxGroup Business Solutions understands that you want to attract and retain new customers.  They have been showing every kind of business from small boutiques to multi-location franchises how to accomplish that predictably and inexpensively for many years. Using proprietary all-in-one software, they combined unique and proprietary approaches combined with proven and existing strategies. MaxGroup has lead for years and has proven that they know how to increase revenue, while customizing campaigns to increase loyalty and gain additional revenue from a business’s existing customer base. Since MaxGroup Business Solutions asserts, “One Company. 100% Reach,” naturally they opened an entire division dedicated to becoming the best SEO company in the industry. “I originally was reluctant about entering the SEO marketplace,” recalls Mark Skovron, Ph.D., CEO of MaxGroup. “It tends even today to be a bit sleazy since every kid who has taken one online course in SEO practices is now promoting themselves as an expert.  To make matters even worse, businesses have been pillaged by so-called SEO companies that charge exorbitant fees, lock customers into long-term contracts, and produce little measurable results.  This has become a blemish on the industry and a dishonor to businesses worldwide.” MaxGroup’s CEO explained that the more he thought about it, the more it presented itself as the perfect opportunity to become involved and correct the malfeasance by doing things differently. Jeff Peltin, SVP, Chief Marketing & Training Officer explained, “Our executive team as well as our top reps in the field came together and held a mastermind session.  I drew a line on a whiteboard and we listed everything the SEO industry does wrong on the left side and on the right side, the opposite method of operating. It only took a few minutes to draw out, but took months to put in place.  Those notes became our SEO business model and our graphic for our SEO brochure.” Since by now, everyone paying attention knows that Google’s latest changes have put the most weight for rank (over 70%) on original and valuable content, MaxGroup Business Solutions decided to launch MaxGroup Media with the objective of getting their client’s businesses published to achieve authority, credibility and trust with both Google for rank and their client’s customers for their businesses.  This is referred to as the “Google Authority Factor,” and it basically decides where your business and website rank and are returned (or not) in terms of search results for a query. This is why digital marketing and branding giant MaxGroup Business Solutions, LLC invested the time, resources and money to create MaxGroup Media, a fully licensed and registered media outlet.  MaxGroup Media has already become one of the industry leading press release distribution services in digital marketing and public relations by nature of the size of their existing client base. MaxGroup Media has become the preferred service provider for many publicists, marketing & advertising agencies, public relations firms, government agencies and individual companies and organizations.  So there is no question; they are committed to the space and they mean business. So it’s quite easy to understand how important and integral regular press releases have become to overall SEO strategies, digital branding and new customer acquisition.  Most SEO companies won’t use press releases because of the cost factor, yet MaxGroup decided to take the full plunge into the industry and has already assembled experienced journalists, editors and professional content writers.   To this end, MaxGroup Media, a MaxGroup Business Solutions company came busting out of the gate with arguably the most comprehensive Press Release Platform with the most amount of syndicating authority out of any fully credentialed news agency.  In reality, minus the television platform, they do in fact have the publishing power of The Associated Press. Their bragging rights include the ability to accomplish: Reach to 100,000+ Journalists instantly Guaranteed Syndication to 500+ Media Outlets Guaranteed Syndication to Top Tier-1 News Networks including ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX, CW Guaranteed Syndication to Google News, Bing News, Google, Yahoo, Bing National, Regional and Local Syndication Maximum Traffic, Visibility and Exposure WHAT OTHERS ARE SAYING ABOUT MAXGROUP “Within two weeks from the time our press release went out a person came into the office and mentioned they saw something on ‘Google’ about Implants and he scheduled an appointment for the following week. Good news ‘Googles’ fast.” – Ann Garcia, Dental Practice “They designed and created our website and they stay on top of our SEO (making sure we are #1 when you google a dentist in our area). It has been a pleasure working with MaxGroup and their staff.  My only regret is that we didn’t make this decision sooner.” – Tracy Harle, Office Manager “Ten years ago, people still relied on morning papers for news. Today, the vast majority of your company’s customers and prospects scan headlines on Twitter or see what’s trending in their Facebook feed. Press releases are a major news source for media outlets.” – HubSpot “Why use social media? Marketing is no longer about the stuff that you make, but about the stories you tell.” – Seth Godin, Author, ‘Unleashing the Idea Virus’ “You should start building your social media platform the moment you decide you’re going to sell something, whether that will be two days or 200 days from now.” – Guy Kawasaki, Author, ‘Rich Dad-Poor Dad’ THE CLIENT FACING BRANDING BLUEPRINT “Branding is one of the most overused words in marketing and advertising today.  But still, lots of people talk about it, and yet few understand it. Simply put, your brand is your promise to your customer and what you stand for as a company, explains Skovron.  “Marketing is all about perception. Once your brand has created a perception in the mind of a customer, it is difficult (if not impossible), and at a minimum – very expensive to change.”  It only makes sense then, that companies such as MaxGroup Business Solutions and MaxGroup Media will thrive in this environment for many years as they continue to get to know their customer’s needs, and implement solutions for their challenges. ‘Find a need and fill it,’ is the oldest commonly quoted explanation about what makes a successful business.  If the adage is true, MaxGroup seems to have the competitive advantage.  Perhaps even many.

Alongside the move to make the SDKs open, Google announced it will be using GitHub as a core part of its own toolchain to make it possible for external developers to contribute. The improvements to Firebase Analytics were announced along with the news that it will no longer be called Firebase Analytics; instead,  all app analytics reports will come under the Google Analytics brand, even those in the Firebase console. In practical terms, the analytics is now integrated with AdMob, so you can include revenue, impression and click data from AdMob with the rest of your event data collected by the Firebase SDK.   Report parameters are another area that has been improved with support for custom parameters. You can now register up to 50 custom event parameters and see their details in your Analytics reports. If you supply numeric parameters you’ll see a graph of the average and the sum of that parameter, while for text parameters you'll see a breakdown of the most popular values.     As with the rest of your Analytics reports, you can also apply Audience and User Property filters to your custom parameter reports to identify trends among different segments of your user base. One improvement that's in beta is i integration with DoubleClick Campaign Manager and DoubleClick Bid Manager. Away from the Analytics, the open source elements that have been announced so far are in the iOS, JavaScript, Java, Node.js and Python SDKs. Plans are underway to open source the Android SDK as well. For the iOS SDK, the Realtime Database, Auth, Cloud Storage and Cloud Messaging (FCM) SDKs are included, with more to follow.  The JavaScript elements that have been open sourced so far are the Realtime Database, Cloud Storage and Cloud Messaging (FCM) SDKs for JavaScript. The developers say the Firebase Authentication will be added soon. All three Admin SDKs for accessing Firebase on privileged environments are now fully open source, including the recently-launched Python SDK.   More Information Firebase Firebase on GitHub Related Articles Google Firebase Adds Analytics, Improves Gaming To be informed about new articles on I Programmer, sign up for our weekly newsletter, subscribe to the RSS feed and follow us on, Twitter, Facebook, Google+ or Linkedin.   IPython 6 Released Supporting Python 3.3 and Above 24/04/2017 IPython 6.0 has been released and, as expected, drops support for the Python 2.7 branch.

Today, there’s another option on the market as mophie, a well-known battery accessory company, has announced the availability of a battery case for the Pixel XL… UAG Samsung Galaxy S8 Cases The mophie juice pack adds two great things to your Pixel XL: almost double the battery life and wireless charging. The case features a 2,950mAh battery which is just slightly smaller than the XL’s 3,450mAh built-in battery. According to mophie, this extends the phone’s talk time to over 50 hours, but it also adds a decent amount of thickness. Wireless charging is another thing that newer flagships have that the Pixel line is missing. Using Qi and “other” technologies, when this case is on your handset, all you need to do is set it down on a wireless charger and let it do its thing. If you don’t want to wirelessly charge your phone, there is a USB Type-C port which will charge the case and the phone at the same time. If you want to purchase a mophie juice pack for your Pixel XL, you can either order one online directly from mophie or try your luck and grab one from your local Verizon store. The case is available starting today for $99.95. mophie introduces juice pack battery case made for Google Pixel XL Orange County, Calif., (May 22, 2017) – mophie—the #1 mobile battery case brand in the US(1) — is bringing wireless charging to the Google Pixel XL with its latest battery case.

But perhaps the first event that made the public take note of the rise of AI, or artificial intelligence, came a few months earlier than that. An AI called AlphaGo scored a momentous victory over Lee Se-dol, one of the all-time best players of Go, the staggeringly complex ancient Chinese board game. In defeating Lee 4-1, DeepMind, the British startup acquired by Google in 2014 and developer of AlphaGo, achieved something that many computer scientists believed would be decades away. But the matter wasn’t quite settled among the Go community. The world’s current number one, a 19-year-old Chinese player named Ke Jie, came out after AlphaGo’s first win declaring that he believed he could defeat the AI; Ke toned down his rhetoric as AlphaGo further demonstrated his dominance over the series, but the point remains that AlphaGo hadn’t quite beaten the best humanity had to offer. This week, the matter will be settled once and for all. Ke Jie and AlphaGo will face off in a three-game match in Wuzhen, China, as part of the Future of Go Summit being held by Google. As well as the Go matches, the event will host a series of panels from many of Google’s artificial intelligence and machine learning luminaries, who we can expect to expand on many of the initiatives Google laid out last week at I/O. Related Why Google's Go win is such a big deal AlphaGo’s capabilities will further be tested in two exhibition matches with intriguing stipulations. The first, Pair Go, will see two Chinese pros face off against each other alongside an AlphaGo teammate: since Go strategy requires immense foresight and strategy, the helping hand could be more of a hindrance in practice for both human and computer, removing their abilities to plan ahead. Much of the drama last year came from AlphaGo’s unorthodox, baffling moves that later turned out to be inspired and even beautiful, so it will be fascinating to see how the AI performs under these conditions. The second exhibition match, Team Go, is more straightforward: five Chinese pro players will basically gang up on AlphaGo, working together in an attempt to take the AI down. Will the collaborative approach help the human players by providing an avenue for new ideas, or will it be a case of too many people cluttering the strategy? Either way, it’ll make for an opponent unlike any AlphaGo has faced to date. And both stipulation matches will demonstrate not only a wider range of AlphaGo’s capabilities than before, but how the arrival of AI has changed the way that humans play Go. Most eyes will be on the Ke Jie showdown, however, and with good reason. If Ke wins, it won’t exactly diminish DeepMind’s achievement, but it may prompt a slowing of the AI hype train that has occasionally threatened to derail over the past year. If AlphaGo wins, on the other hand, it’ll confirm that the game of Go has been essentially beaten, and no doubt prompt further handwringing about the machines taking over. Related DeepMind founder Demis Hassabis on how AI will shape the future “Instead of diminishing the game, as some feared, artificial intelligence has actually made human players stronger and more creative,” DeepMind CEO and co-founder Demis Hassabis said upon the announcement of the Future of Go Summit. “It’s humbling to see how pros and amateurs alike, who have pored over every detail of AlphaGo’s innovative game play, have actually learned new knowledge and strategies about perhaps the most studied and contemplated game in history. Clearly, there remains much more to learn from this partnership between Go’s best human players and its most creative AI competitor.“ What’s going to happen? Last time, no-one really knew what to predict, but AlphaGo’s strong showing against Lee Se-dol makes it the clear favorite to take the three-game match — it’s likely to be even stronger with another year or so of machine learning under its artificial belt. There’s also the small matter that the AI has already beaten Ke Jie multiple times before in online games conducted under a pseudonym, though that’s a very different setting than the formality of an official match. Ke Jie (far right) explains the beauty of AlphaGo's moves to Google CEO Sundar Pichai Google “My thoughts are that both Ke Jie and the team will have a low chance of winning because when AlphaGo played 60 games online, no one managed to expose its weakness,” says Lee Ha-jin, secretary general of the International Go Federation until last year and a pro player herself. “If I had to choose, I would say the team has a better chance.” Ultimately, of course, the promise of AI is about more than solving board games. This week you can expect to hear DeepMind speak about its health initiatives, and Google should go into further detail about how machine learning is already improving many of its products. But the summit will also serve as a fascinating focal point for the impact of AI; an abstract board game created thousands of years ago in China is now right at the center of what could be one of the most profound technological developments of our time. Go may not be the endgame, but it’s a beguiling, engrossing context for these conversations to be held in. “I am still excited to see the games!” says Lee Ha-jin, who doesn’t particularly seem to mind if AlphaGo prevails. “Go is like a journey and what happens in the journey is more interesting than the result.” The Verge is in Wuzhen covering the Future of Go Summit.

The email comes from a lawsuit filed by an anonymous Google employee who claims the company runs a "spying program" that encourages employees to report each other for leaking information to the press or public, as The Information first reported in December. The lawsuit says the program violates California labor law. According to the latest filing, which was first spotted by The Verge, the email was written by Brian Katz, who identifies himself as the leader of Google's "Investigations team," which includes the "stopleaks@" tip line that allegedly encourages Google employees to report leakers. The email refers to an incident last year when a transcript from an internal all-hands "TGIF" meeting leaked to Recode. The email says the employees who leaked the transcript and memes were identified and fired and warns employees against leaking internal information to the press. A Google spokesperson sent the following statement to Business Insider, but didn't address the "stopleaks@" program at the center of the lawsuit: "We're very committed to transparency and having an open culture, which means we frequently share with employees confidential details of product launches and other types of sensitive, proprietary business information," the spokesperson said in a written email statement. "Our employee confidentiality policies are designed to protect that information, without preventing employees from disclosing information about their terms and conditions of employment, or workplace concerns."

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google to check Android apps for quality with six vital metrics By Rei Padla - May 22, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter The Android platform now has 2 billion global monthly users while the number of Android apps listed on the Play Store has reached about 2.8 million. You can only download so much depending on your device’s memory. You need to be wise on which ones to keep and really use because space is limited. Throughout the years, app sizes increase because of the improvement in graphics, speed, and fluidity. To improve the experience, Google needs to not just update the code of the OS. Change has to come from the developers themselves to start the work and ensure that their apps are now only up-to-date but also follows the highest standards in app development. A lot of factors change the apps, their popularity, and ranking but if you are a developer and you want your work to remain, you have to make important changes so app is stable and is battery-efficient. There are metrics that will be used and time will come that you will have to comply once again to Google. If not, there is a possilibity that your app will be removed. According to a Google executive, each app will be checked by looking at the percentages of users that faced the following: (1) experienced at least one app crash; (2) got the “Application not responding error”; (3) had an app keep their device awake for more than an hour; (4) ran into “frozen,” laggy frame rendering; (5) experienced an app that woke up their device more than 10 times an hour; and (6) saw the app run at slower than 60 frames per second. When Google begins to look into these apps, we’re certain that a lot of apps will be removed from the Play Store. If not removed, then rankings will change. That may be bad news for devs but more good news for the consumers because this means the Play Store will have better quality apps. It’s about time the Android app ecosystem be improved after many years. It’s a constant struggle but looking at each and every app will be helpful. With all those milions of apps, there must be a way that Google effectively weeds out the unnecesary titles. You see, not all apps are useful or are properfly working. Sad to say that there are some that don’t live up to expectations or haven’t been updated in a long time. We know that the company is doing its best to make Google Play friendlier to game developers so expect changes to be revealed soon. Then again, these developers must also think how to improve the quality of their apps on their own. Google has standards but the developers make some enhancements on their own.

The company’s focus has historically been on building an engaged user base through its intuitive, visual interface. As a social network, it has always offered something a little different. However, advertisers have been skeptical about whether Pinterest could ‘monetize’ this model, due to the nature of engagements users have and also the demographics that typically spend time on the site. Those concerns have not been allayed altogether, but Pinterest has made some fascinating moves of late. They have launched a paid search partnership with Kenshoo, completely upgraded their visual search capabilities, and expanded their reach by adding a new Google Chrome extension. By combining an engaged user base with advertising that doesn’t disrupt their experience, Pinterest may have a formula that works in an age of ad blockers and decreased consumer attention spans. Their stated aim has been to own the ‘discovery’ phase of the purchase journey, suggesting products to users before they know exactly what they are looking for. Google has clearly taken notice, too. The search giant’s recent product launches, such as its ‘similar items’ feature and the recent announcement of Google Lens, demonstrate Google’s strategy to stymie Pinterest’s growth. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, after all.

But before taking the plunge and launching a paid campaign, there are some things we need to know. As such, it seems timely to take a step back and assess what really differentiates Pinterest from the competition, what options are open to marketers, and what you need to know before getting started with Pinterest advertising.

Stop overloading your Local SEO content! Developing content for your local business website is clearly important for search engine optimization, but that doesn't mean that more content is always better. Columnist Greg Gifford explains and suggests an alternative strategy. Greg Gifford on May 22, 2017 at 10:07 am More I’ve been spending a lot of time on the road, speaking at conferences and talking to marketers and business owners, and I’ve been having the “content” talk far too often lately. You know, the one that’s almost as awkward as sitting down with your kids to talk about the birds and the bees, but where you’re talking to a business owner and telling them that their last SEO agency duped them. For some reason, more than ever before, it seems like most business owners (and many marketers) are equating content with SEO. It’s like suddenly, the only thing that matters is content, content, CONTENT. If multiple pages aren’t added to the site every month, then obviously, no SEO has been performed. Hopefully, everyone reading this knows that the “content, content, CONTENT” play is way off-base. The problem is that most business owners don’t know, and many of us aren’t doing a sufficient job of educating business owners to show them why. If there’s a huge disconnect between what marketers know and business owners believe, we’re all going to have problems keeping clients. So this month’s edition of Greg’s Soapbox is calling out the “content, content, CONTENT” play and showing why overloading on content is a bad strategy. Lazy local content pages are usually doorway pages In most cases, the local content play involves the monthly addition of “location” targeted pages to a website. Yes, this is a legitimate strategy when done correctly, but, in practice, most of the time the pages created are simply doorway pages. They’re thin pages without any useful content with the sole purpose of ranking in local searches. Google calls those doorway pages and actually penalizes sites for using them. Yep, this is old news — the penalty rolled out in 2015 — but I’m seeing a resurgence of doorway pages in local SEO over the past few months. If your site or your potential client’s site has a ton of pages that aren’t included in any menu, and they’re all basically the same page with different cities listed on each iteration, you’ve got doorway pages. Let’s look at the official Google support docs that talk about doorway pages: Doorways are sites or pages created to rank highly for specific search queries. They are bad for users because they can lead to multiple similar pages in user search results, where each result ends up taking the user to essentially the same destination. They can also lead users to intermediate pages that are not as useful as the final destination. Here are some examples of doorways: Having multiple domain names or pages targeted at specific regions or cities that funnel users to one page Pages generated to funnel visitors into the actual usable or relevant portion of your site(s) Substantially similar pages that are closer to search results than a clearly defined, browsable hierarchy Google’s early 2015 announcement about the Doorway Page Penalty is even more specific: Is the purpose to optimize for search engines and funnel visitors into the actual usable or relevant portion of your site, or are they an integral part of your site’s user experience? Do the pages duplicate useful aggregations of items (locations, products, etc.) that already exist on the site for the purpose of capturing more search traffic? Do these pages exist as an “island?” Are they difficult or impossible to navigate to from other parts of your site? Are links to such pages from other pages within the site or network of sites created just for search engines? Since most of the low-quality local content pages clearly fail these questions, alerting business owners to these pages — and the possible penalty for having them — can go a long way toward helping them understand why continuing to push content pages out every month can be harmful. It’s simple: are the pages there for humans? If you’re a car dealer, and you’ve got 25 pages on your site about the 2017 Ford F-150, with each one targeting a different city, then you’re probably in bad shape. It’s likely that none of the pages are on your main menu, or even within one click of a main menu page. The pages probably all have the same photo of a truck and only a few sentences about how you sell that truck in that particular city. Do these pages provide any value at all for an actual human? Absolutely not. Even if you rewrite the content 25 times, they’re still useless. Sure, they’re not “duplicate” pages, but they’re repetitive pages. They all say exactly the same thing, only with a different city mentioned. There’s zero value there. When you’re writing content for your site, or when your SEO agency is writing the content, you have to ask yourself if the content is being added to make your site better for users — or just to show up in search engines. If the thought process is “This will help me show up in searches in that city,” then your thought process is wrong. You’re not going to gain more visibility in searches in other cities simply by adding a few lazy pages to your site. Period. How many pages do you really need? Many business owners I talk to ask the question, “How many pages do I need?” and the answer is simple. You need however many you need to answer your customers’ questions. Simply adding 10 pages (or 15 pages, or 20 pages) of content a month won’t make your site any better than adding only a few poorly designed location or product pages. In fact, your site will be infinitely better if you only add one or two quality pages every month. Once you’ve got your site where you need it, you don’t even need to keep adding pages! If you’ve decided to add 15 pages a month to your site, ask yourself where that number came from. Why 15? Why 20? What’s the strategy there, and what questions will you be answering? Local SEO is not only content. Many of the factors that affect your local SEO success don’t even live on your website. If you want to target other cities, it takes much more than creating a few repetitive location pages. For a detailed plan of a better way (involving content pages, blog posts, social media, and link building), check out my post from the summer of 2015 about Local Content Silos.

Richard Oakes Google doodle honors activist who championed rights of the American Indian Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Oakes organized peaceful demonstrations aiming to give American Indians the right to control their lands. Amy Gesenhues on May 22, 2017 at 10:10 am More Today’s Google doodle honors American Indian rights activist Richard Oakes. The illustration spotlights Oakes among three US locations that impacted his life — the Akwesasne reservation on the Canada-New York border where Oakes grew up; Alcatraz Island where he organized his most powerful protest; and Pit River, where he helped the Pit River Tribe fight for their land in Northern California. “Over his time as an activist, he fought peacefully for freedom, justice, and the right of American Indians to have control over their lands,” writes the Google doodle team on its blog. Google notes Oakes’ activism and “passion for empowerment through education” was a catalyst for one of the first American Indian studies programs in the US. The doodle leads to a search for “Richard Oakes activist” and includes the usual sharing icon to post the image on social pages or send via email.

Columnist Wesley Young explains why this isn't the good idea that it may seem to be. Wesley Young on May 22, 2017 at 11:15 am More Why are we still having this discussion? Because data show that a surprising number of businesses still don’t have a website. Surveys from as recently as October 2016 find that close to half of all small businesses don’t have a website, and it’s not just solo work-from-home moonlighters, either. Specifically, a Capital One survey of 400 small businesses  — its Fall 2016 Small Business Barometer Survey — found that only 56 percent have a company website. And only 53 percent of those were mobile-optimized. In other words, fewer than 30 percent of businesses surveyed had a mobile-optimized website. Further, there is a fair argument that websites are no longer as effective in the local market. Technology and cost certainly are no longer barriers given the availability of subscription options for even the least sophisticated users and slick DIY platforms for those who don’t want to hire a freelancer or agency. Instead, the challenge is that websites must compete for relevance in a market with many other media platforms — social media sites, directories and review sites — that are often viewed as proxies for the face of the franchise. Today, social media is dominating SMB attention, a survey conducted by the Local Search Association (my employer) has found. Almost 43 percent of SMBs surveyed said that it would be the media of choice if they could only select one form of online marketing to use. That was the top choice by a large margin, with SEO ranking second at 25.6 percent. This preference explains why social media pages such as Facebook pages are increasingly used as the primary public-facing “landing page.” Other “proxy” home pages include directory listings that are sophisticated enough to contain virtually all the key information customers are looking for. Third-party sites can integrate multiple functions such as e-commerce, online booking and reviews and attract a bigger and broader audience than an individual website. And even Google profiles, knowledge graphs and snack-pack listings can suck huge amounts of traffic away from a website. All in all, median click-through-rate (CTR) from a #1 result on Google is down 37 percent over the last two years, according to a study by Wordstream. That seems like pretty strong evidence fewer people are visiting websites and are instead relying on other media. While these reasons are seemingly enough to persuade some that third-party-owned pages are a sufficient and simpler alternative to maintaining a business website, other data reveal a different story. Below are five reasons why every business needs a company website for local search marketing. 1. 63% of consumers use websites to find or engage with businesses According to LSA’s (Local Search Association) April 2017 report, “The Digital Consumer Study,” that examined digital media use in 12 US cities, websites were the second most-used media to find local businesses. Only two forms of media were used by the majority of consumers when looking at “past week” usage trends: search engines and company websites. Consumers use websites to find or engage with businesses 63 percent of the time. And while the perception is that the variety of media available to consumers would decrease website use, LSA’s numbers show something different — 2016’s weekly website usage rate of 63 percent was an increase over 2015’s 60 percent rate. These numbers show that despite the growth of other media, the value of websites has not diminished – in fact, it continues to grow. While Wordstream’s study showed a decline in CTR from Google SERPs (search engine results pages), consumers are finding and clicking through to business websites from other sources such as Yelp, YellowPages.com and Google My Business listings. 2. The top 10 local organic factors for SEO are related to websites Only 5 percent of consumers surveyed by BrightLocal in 2016 never used search engines to find local businesses — which means 95 percent have. And 69 percent reported searching for a local business at least six times per year. So SEO is a big deal. According to Moz’s 2017 Local Search Ranking Factors, the top 10 factors for appearing in organic Google search results are related to a business’s website or domain. These factors include how authoritative your website is, based on who is linking to your site, how many third parties are linking to you and the quality and relevance of your content, to name a few. While arguably, these factors can be fulfilled on a Facebook page, realistically, that doesn’t happen. For one thing, a major factor — authority of the site — is difficult to achieve on a social media site, since Google doesn’t consider social signals such as likes or followers in weighing influence. I performed a few test searches on Google of snorkel gear, ski equipment and pool supplies in Plano and Frisco, Texas, and found only two Facebook pages of local businesses — and they were deep into the search results. In both cases, the Facebook pages appeared many results after the respective websites of those businesses. Note that I’m not talking about searches in which a business’s name is specifically typed into the search box. Those results commonly return Facebook pages, Yelp listings and Groupon offers. However, since finding new customers is the top marketing priority for businesses, according to a Unity Marketing survey last year, businesses can’t count on folks who already know their name and proactively search for it. Maintaining a website that has quality and relevant content that is consistently referenced and linked by other reputable third-party directories, sites, articles and posts is critical to being found when customers conduct research online and are looking for products and services to buy. 3. Local snack-pack and Google map results are influenced by websites, too According to Moz, the biggest impact on local pack ranking factors is your Google My Business (GMB) profile and the proximity of your business to the searcher. Yet having a complete and rich GMB profile does not guarantee you will show up in Google local finder or map results. Businesses often make the mistake of assuming that you’ll automatically show up in searches for your business category (as listed in your GMB profile) in your geographic area. Despite the fact that proximity, physical address and GMB business category rank 1, 2 and 3 in Moz’s local pack ranking factors, Google often lists businesses that are not in the initial search area while omitting results that would otherwise match the search, deeming those other results more authoritative. It’s not just new or small businesses that are affected, either; big brands can struggle with this, too. Some of the factors that affect organic SEO rankings — such as backlinks, domain authority and clicks — are also essential to ranking and appearing in Google local finder and map results. Also, I’ve found that having location-based information on your website and linking to that source from your GMB profile can help boost local search results. 4. 30% of consumers won’t consider a business without a website Just because someone looks at your Facebook page or reads reviews on Yelp doesn’t mean they don’t also want to see your website. In fact, consumers typically rely on multiple sources to gather information before making a purchase decision. Research by YP and LSA found that, on average, consumers use approximately three sources before making an individual purchase decision. And 30 percent automatically strike a business from consideration if they don’t have a website. Thus, those businesses that don’t have a website experience a significant loss of ready-to-buy, high-intent potential customers. 5. 46% say a website is the biggest determinant of whether they trust a company Consumers may find you on Facebook, Google Maps or Yelp, but one big part of your online reputation comes from your website. Research conducted at Stanford in 2002 (PDF) found that 46 percent of consumers made their decision about a website’s credibility based upon its design, layout and typography. Listings may provide business details, and reviews give other customers’ opinions, but on a website, prospective customers hear directly from you about you. Facebook and other social media provide a partial view of your business, but the ability to personalize the design is extremely limited, and your information is presented in a format that’s the same for everyone. A website is a storefront that reflects your identity and allows your consumers to form opinions on the quality of your products or services, the trustworthiness of your business and whether you are someone they want to buy from. It is especially important for services. According to a study from the e-tailing Group and Oracle (PDF), 75 percent of consumers say the quality of product images is essential in selecting and purchasing products online. For services, a website is your product image. Closing thoughts It may seem easy as marketers and agencies to just do what our clients want. Yet marketing decisions that SMBs make may be based on incomplete or out-of-context information. For example, an SMB may look at the time consumers spend on social media and quickly conclude that its marketing resources should be spent in proportion to that social media use. Or an SMB may make an even bigger mistake and decide that it can rely solely on social media. I’m not bashing social media as a marketing tool. However, it behooves us as marketers to educate our clients and make sure they understand the context of data they use to make decisions. We should help our clients look deeper into consumer trends and come away with better insights to make good decisions. One of those is to avoid sacrificing websites in favor of social media or other media in local search marketing. Websites remain a critical part of local search and are essential for attracting the customers necessary for business growth.

Netflix was just the start: Google Play Console lets developers exclude app availability for devices that don't pass SafetyNet Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 3:57am PDTMay 18, 2017 99 Plus 1 on G+ 113 Share on Facebook 86 Share on Twitter Total Shares298 Google News Last weekend, a huge turmoil swept the root-enthusiast Android community as it was discovered then confirmed that the Netflix app was being blocked from showing up in search results on the Play Store for rooted devices. At the time, Netflix said it was using Widevine to block unsupported devices, but that made no sense to us: the app was still functional if it was sideloaded, it was only not showing up as compatible in the Play Store. So what sorcery was Netflix really using?! Turns out it's a new function of the Google Play Console. As part of the updates announced for the Play Console at I/O 2017, Google mentions a new Device Catalog section under Release management that lets developers choose with intricate granularity which devices their app supports on the Play Store. Devices can be viewed and excluded by many attributes including RAM and SoC, but the important factor we're interested in is SafetyNet Attestation. New "Device catalog" lets devs manage the exclusions. Developers will be able to choose from 3 states shown in the top image: not excluding devices based on SafetyNet, excluding those that don't pass integrity, or excluding the latter plus those that aren't certified by Google. That means any dev could potentially block their apps from showing and being directly installable in the Play Store on devices that are rooted and/or running a custom ROM, as well as on emulators and uncertified devices (think Meizu and its not-so-legal way of getting Play Services and the Play Store on its phones). This is exactly what many of you were afraid would happen after the Play Store app started surfacing a Device certification status. This is different from the full SafetyNet API implementation that apps like Android Pay and Pokémon Go use. In the case of Pay/Go, the attestation check happens when the app is installed on your phone and doesn't allow it to run unless it passes the integrity test. But in the case of the Play Console, the attestation check happens when you're browsing the Play Store and only affects the availability of the app for your device. If the full SafetyNet API isn't included in the app itself, you will still be able to grab the APK from other sources, install it, and the app will work just fine. Still, this spells trouble for rooted users and the Android enthusiast community as a whole. Google keeps erecting more and more obstacles each day in the face of root and custom ROMs and even if this won't stop root users who should be knowledgable enough to know how/where to grab an APK and install it, it will make things more and more difficult and maybe less and less worth the trouble. But y'all are rebels and you'll keep on finding a way around it, won't you?

EowynCarter I want "just work" stuff. Not workaround. Maybe Magisk does the job for some, but not an acceptable solution from my point of view. Mainly the "we don't know if it will keep on working" part. saf1927 Well, it's the best solution so far and it has improved a lot since its inception. I never bothered since the Nexus 5 was a secondary device for me, but now that some apps won't show up anymore on the Play Store, I simply flashed Magisk and that's about it. I haven't tweaked anything. Plus, if you are already flashing a custom ROM, flashing an extra zip file isn't that much work anyway. EowynCarter True, but it's the phone I use dailly. I don't want apps sudendly not working, becasue google decided to push an update that broke magisk. mxwp well if you want things to "just work" then i guess get an iPhone EowynCarter Sadly, I'm beginning to think about that. But that would cause others frustrations. ED-Zが現れた! Well, people will just flock to root-supported apps... Milton P. I actually forgot when was the last time I Rooted a device. No biggie. Suicide_Note The bad thing is it isn't just root that causes problems. Simply unlocking the bootloader will produce the same result. Maxr1998 Just because it's no biggie for you, it doesn't mean everyone approves this. I am actually pretty concerned, because this limits the freedom over our devices even more.. Milton P. Define freedom, please. Maxr1998 Software freedom, to be more specific. You should have the freedom to use and modify your device and it's software however you'd like, and have fill control over it. That means, root access. And since the AOSP core IS free software, the 4 freedoms defined by Richard Stallman apply to it. What this change now introduces is that you're forced to decide between either giving up the freedom over your device or not using the app you wanted to download (which will probably have to be my choice, and that sucks). Milton P. But you're not giving up anything, you just have to make a choice. If you put that way, Google has the freedom of doing with the AOSP core whatever they want, the same way you can modify said core and do as you please, the difference is Google has more money and more responsibilities when it comes to their user base. XDA and other sites will still have a bunch of developers making whatever they please (within the AOSP terms) with the AOSP core. This will just change thinks for the people that use those ROMs bit realistically the vast majority of users won't feel the changes. Sad but true. h4rr4r That choice is giving up freedom you had before. The vast majority will see the rate of Android improvements slow as the Devs on XDA and the like lose interest. Android only exists because of Linux, now it is turning its back on that whole culture. Milton P. Well, I don't see your freedom compromised to be honest with you, but we're seeing things from different angles so that's that. Sorry for your loss in that case. h4rr4r You do not think losing control of your device is a loss of freedom? Milton P. Nope, is just a device, I have more important stuff going on, m device is a tool the same way a hammer is a tool, you can buy a hammer and use it as it is. Sometimes my device is a toy, if I buy a remote control car I'll modify it as long as it is possible, the same way I modify my phone. I have control over my phone. I can install whatever I want at my own risk. If I decide to root my phone I expect things to be broken. I remember when I had an HTC and I hated sense so I decided to install a custom ROM, I gave up the camera and I was aware of it. There was always some compromises with custom ROMs, nothing is changing. I rather have a safe device then a compromised one today, still my choice thou. h4rr4r So you want IOS. Got it. Over here I want freedom. I don't think homedepot should be allowed to tell me what I can hit with the hammer I bought. trparky Open platforms rarely stay open once they become popular. Once the Benjamins come rolling in it tends to override open. h4rr4r Tell that to Linus Torvalds. I am sure he will have many many fuck yous for you. trparky Linux is the rare situation. h4rr4r The rare situation like many others that created android and even google. trparky Yeah but look at Android, the walls are closing around it and there's nothing you can do about it. Face it man, the geeks may have built the system but the common man now rules it. Geeks love choice, yes, they do love their choice but your average person doesn't give a rat's ass about choice. All they want is a device that does what they need it to do when they want to do it. They have no inclination to learn how it works or why it works just as long as it does. This is what geeks do not and refuse to understand. h4rr4r Sure there is, stop using it. Then the common folks will have to follow us to the next platform. trparky As long as their is money involved in maintaining Android it doesn't matter if something better comes along, people will continue supporting Android because it makes them money. Money makes the world go round, get used to it. Maxr1998 ^ What @h4rr4r:disqus says. trparky Yep. The root and ROM community is such a small portion of the Android ecosystem that they really don't matter to them. People have been screaming at Google for years to get the Android house fixed up, this is them doing just that. You can't blame them for doing what the people have asked for. mxwp I agree with you, but sadly you only have freedom over hardware. You can do what you want with the device you buy. But with software you never actually buy it... you only buy a license to use it. Thus you have no real freedom with software. Maxr1998 Android is free software, Apache 2.0 license. At least the AOSP part of it. trparky But the Google parts of it are not covered under the Apache 2.0 license. That's essentially why ROM developers can't package the Google Play Services pack with the ROM itself and instead requires you to download a separate ZIP package from Google to install it separate from the ROM package. Android itself may be free and open but the Google Play Services part is not. Sudev There are far more than few arguments against root access but here are some: Root access is meant for experimental & development purpose and not for Daily Driver for any average user of the platform. Google Play Services & Apps available on Play Store are not "Free Software". Google as provider of Play Services infrastructure has much more liabilities then one can simply assume. And also the app developers have responsibility to protect end users' data. If device has root access available and any rouge app / maleware steals other apps data which is possible, who will be at stack? Maxr1998 1) No, it isn't. Just look at Linux/Windows. There you need root/admin access for installing or updating applications all the time. You type in your password (on Linux) or click grant, done! Same with using e.g. SuperSu on Android, you grant the su request, done. 2) Google doesn't use it to protect YOUR data, they provide it as DRM method for 3rd parties - basically "locking down" your device. 3) Uhmmm.. Nope? If you root your device, apps can't just use the su rights without your permission - except if they use an exploit, which would also work on an unrooted device. And if you yourself give a malware app su rights because you couldn't understand the situation, it's completely your own fault. h4rr4r The ability to do anything I want with my things that I own. Milton P. You​ can do whatever you want with your device, nobody is stopping you. You might see that some apps are not showing up in the play store but you can still side load them, I still see freedom in your future. h4rr4r For how much longer? Soon these apps will ask play services if they are supposed to be installed on that device, at that point you can say goodbye to sideloading. If this is what people want then IOS was the platform for them. thecoolkid Ok Google, define freedom... 😁 Nick I would imagine a great deal of people on this site will be upset, but in actuality I don't think this will affect the user base of many apps that badly h4rr4r Not in the short term. However in the long term it will. Android only exists because of the FREE software movement. Nick Yes, but that doesn't apply to applications, which this is about. h4rr4r Think long term. Same thing applies. trparky No it won't because the root and ROM community is so small it doesn't matter to Google anymore. The 95% of people who simply want a device that works don't care and likely won't ever care. As long as they can play NetFlix, Pokemon Go, or whatever is the next craze they don't care. h4rr4r Again, that is short term thinking. Think past the end of your nose. Android exists because of linux. Google needs this small group to create the very stuff they rely on. trparky You overestimate the value that the community has now. Android may have needed the community back in the beginning to gain the foothold that it has in the market but not so anymore. Android has near 100% market penetration, they have achieved world domination. They don't need the community anymore, they have achieved their goals. h4rr4r Until they are unseated. IBM once had a monopoly on computing devices. They did not need the community to gain a foothold, they would not have a product to gain a foothold without the community. Android only exists because of a collection of those projects. trparky No, Android exists because Samsung, HTC, and LG make devices people want and it makes them money by the semi-truck full. The community doesn't mean shit now, all that matters to these companies is one thing... money, money, and more money. Oh, and did I mention money? This is capitalism man, money rules the world. If you don't make money you are dead. h4rr4r Please tell me how that would have happened without linux. Money loses to good engineering every day. Look at how linux killed solaris. trparky Tell me why Windows is the defacto monopoly on the desktop despite the fact that Linux is better in every damn way possible under the hood? That's right... money. h4rr4r Because the desktop is dead. The fight is over. They lost. Even money can't keep them relevant. trparky Oh, you're funny. The desktop is not dead, it will never be dead. When people need to do real work, they sit down at a desktop. When people want to play real games, they sit down at a desktop. When people need to type out anything longer than a page like a college term paper, they sit down at a desktop. The desktop is king and will always be king. Long live the desktop! h4rr4r The Desktop is a dead man walking. When they do real work, they use a Citrix session. When they game they use a console, or they are already nerds. When people type they can use a fucking chromebook. The desktop as you think of it died already. trparky Try and say that shit over at TechPowerUp, HardOCP, Overclock.net, TomsHardware, etc. and trust me when I say this... you'll be run out of town by people with pitchforks and torches. h4rr4r Those are all nerds. Those are the folks who have desktops running 3 different OSes. They are the folks who are pissed about android being locked down. trparky And your point being? You just admitted that only the "nerds" care about Android being open. Sure, those same "nerds" will go off and create a new platform but the rest of the people who are living in the real world and who don't care one damn bit about how it works will continue to use Android. h4rr4r Those people will eventually move to the new platform. Just like they did with Android. trparky And the same thing will happen to that platform in the future that's happening to Android now. Open platforms are nice and all, I'll admit that, but your average person doesn't care one bit. I dare you to go up to any person on the street and ask them anything about Android. What phone do they have? What model? Most will say "I don't know, something that my carrier gave me for cheap." h4rr4r The wheel of computing we call it. It has happened and will happen again. So what? trparky Which reinforces the idea that I said before, eventually all open systems will become closed (or less open) at some point in their life cycle. It usually happens when it becomes popular with the common man. Why? Because like I've been trying to get through your thick skull, the average person doesn't care how any of this stuff works so long as it works. h4rr4r The average person does not matter. Few open systems become closed. AOSP is still fine. trparky What the hell do you mean by "they don't matter"? They're the ones buying the devices, buying the apps, looking at the ads, etc. Just how the fuck does that translate to "they don't matter"? h4rr4r Because they don't. They don't create, they don't cause new things to be created. They are just users, just like I don't matter to how movies are created. trparky But without money from the people who are consuming said things developers won't make new stuff. Developers do have to eat you know and put a roof over their heads. h4rr4r The giant world of FOSS pretty much proves you wrong. Demand cannot create supply. I don't pirate anything kiddo. I have way too much to lose for that. One of those lawsuits I would actually have to pay, since I could. trparky I'll give a hint on how FOSS works a lot of the time. Some of the top tier Linux kernel developers actually work for companies and they just contribute code in their free time. They may work for Intel, AMD, nVidia, or God knows what but only after their day job is done. Why? Because they need money and they need to eat. This is a basic requirement for people in this world. They need money!!! People don't just write code for the love of it, even Linus Torvalds who's in charge of the Linux kernel itself works for the Linux Foundation and yes, he gets paid for his work to the tune of $10 Million a year. Sorry to burst your bubble man but FOSS projects aren't all happy, happy, joy, joy here... people need to be paid real money to be able to eat, drive a car, put a roof over their heads, etc. On second thought, I'm not sorry I burst your bubble! You need it burst! PEOPLE NEED TO BE PAID REAL FUCKING MONEY!!!! h4rr4r No, they get paid to contribute. During the work day. Not as a hobby. Lots of projects are like that. I won't say exactly how I know about that ;) Their employers just aren't as short sighted as you. Linus did not however create linux to get rich. Great code like great art gets created because it must be. People do what they love. Kid, you will get it one day. When you have enough that you aren't worried about it each day, money stops being that big of a deal. Don't worry everybody goes through a phase like you are now. trparky Dude, we are not the Federation of Planets here living in a happy, happy, joy, joy world in which people can just do whatever they want to do without a care in the world. As long as human greed exists there will always be a need for money. And believe you me, greed will never go away unless we breed a new kind of human and I don't see that happening any time soon. Gene Roddenberry's future will never happen, it just won't. Contrary to a lot of geek dreams it just won't. h4rr4r No idea where you got that idea. Never suggested it. My point was the personal relative value of increasing income drops as income goes up. If you make minimum wage doubling your income is a huge deal. Adding the same amount to my income would not get me to take a job I like less. Offering it to Linus would be a waste of time. Yes, some people will keep chasing dollars, they are the exception not the rule. The employers are working on enlightened self interest. Either they use the FOSS product, gain market advantage with direct knowledge, use it for marketing or believe they are getting something else. PostgreSQL for example has a lot of paid contributors who work for companies that either provide customization, consulting or depend on the project. Others just because it increases quality. Commercial software by and large is not high quality. I have seen a lot of it and 90% if you tried to submit it to a FOSS project of any size would get you denied and possibly mocked. This system continues to be more innovative because it is easy to continue to expand. Anyone with a good idea can fork if their idea is not accepted. trparky > My point was the personal relative value of increasing income drops as income goes up. Tell that to the people in Washington or any CEO that demands ever increasing yearly salaries and end of year bonuses all while raping the companies that they work for. Tell that to the psychopaths on Wall Street. For as long as their is money, people will want more of it. Anyone who says that they don't is flat out lying. h4rr4r Those are the exception not the rule. That is why you call them psychopaths. Honestly, correcting for inflation I really don't care that much if I ever make more. Would it be nice sure, would I give up anything I like about my job? No. If you could double my income but it prevented me from contributing to FOSS projects or owning code I generate off the clock, I would not take that deal. If money was enough to make people do anything MS would have offered Linus $11 million a year to not write it. Heck, Sun would have done it while they were still around. trparky What can I say, I have a VERY cynical view of the world. This world is going to hell is a handcart and every day it's picking up speed. trparky What can I say, I have a VERY cynical view of the world. This world is going to hell is a handcart and every day it's picking up speed. Every day we're going faster and faster down that hill straight to hell. Those who have the money may survive but the rest of us poor slobs have no hope of surviving what's coming next. trparky Either you're a child that doesn't know how the adult world works or you're a fucking troll. h4rr4r So you have no idea who makes stuff, neat. I guess you think Henry Ford should have made a faster horse. trparky Oh, I know who makes the stuff I use but I also make sure that they are paid! I give money to those developers who write the programs that I enjoy and if I can't pay them I won't use their programs. I only use a program if I can pay for it. I have put money into their tip jars on their web site, I look for PayPal links and I donate even if it's something small like $5. They deserve it! h4rr4r Good for you! There is a lot of great software that does not make money that way. Some even just ask is that you follow the license, like linux which mediatek steals by not releasing kernel source. So I hope you avoid buying that kind of thing. trparky MediaTek controller chips are known to suck so I don't buy them out of that reason alone. h4rr4r Now I have given you another good reason to avoid them. Bunch of thieves. Rita El Khoury I don't even remember when I last bootloader unlocked. But I know this move toward closing the ecosystem further and further will have ripples in the future. The enthusiast community flocked toward Android for its openness and we have custom ROMs and their enterprising devs to thank for HUNDREDS of new features that they implemented first and everyone clamored for and applauded until they became features in AOSP. If Google thinks it can steer this ship alone and it knows best what to do next, we may have less and less interesting features in the future and more and more of what only one entity thinks is best, not a diverse set of opinions. Nick Given that this only gives the developer the option of requiring these checks, it makes me believe that Google had to do this for some companies that have regulatory or other kinds of requirements. Which is a shame for the rooted (and unlocked?) community, but understandable. Shame Google is most likely going to take the blame here in this comment section though. Rita El Khoury Well, maybe they had to, but that won't stop any developer from implementing it without any regulatory or legal requirement pushing them to do so. Nick Right, which puts this choice on the developer, not Google. Google was stuck behind a rock and hard place, perhaps. EowynCarter Well, google is certainly to blame for not planing to update my nexus 6 to android O. And now I can't even use custom rom as plan B without losing some apps :( Suicide_Note Boo hoo. Buy a new phone and quit crying that Google doesn't support phones forever. EowynCarter Fine can you order a pixel XL and ship it to me in France ? Plus, my nexus 6 still works, I hate having to replace working stuff. Makes no sense, economically and ecologically speaking. Suicide_Note I'll sell you my XL when I'm done with it, but only after i get the Pixel XL 2. :) EowynCarter Well, I do hope Google sells the "pixel 2 "( or whatever its name) here. For now, I'm'just hoping my nexus 6 don't break. Else I might jump on the iOS ship. I'm not convinced the the other android alternatives. Note 8 would be the closest, but touchwiiz, delayed updates.... I'm spoiled after a few years with a nexus. Suicide_Note There always eBay or Swappa if you want to get a first gen Pixel. I was looking at prices over the weekend, and mint condition Pixels are going for about $450. EowynCarter Not so much in France. And eBay for suff that cost more that a few bucks, too risky. Plus, the pixel is getting "old" by now. Wilton Daniel Pinto Troll found trparky Yet Microsoft still supports Windows 7 EIGHT YEARS LATER! How come Microsoft can do that yet Google can't? Alex Louderback Actually, that's Qualcomm EowynCarter Source for this ? trparky And Qualcomm can go fuck themselves. Gee... I wonder why they're being hit with an anti-trust lawsuit. Could this be one of many reasons why? trparky Yes, Google is to blame for that. There's no damn reason why your Nexus 6 can't run Android O other than the fact that they just don't want to. Bojan Bunić My bootloader was unlocked prior to changing the mobo on my 5X, courtesy of Booty Loops. Root, well, probably before I got my Nexus 4. Although I'll see how it'll go on in the future, as we don't have Pixels here, so the only near stock possibility is either OnePlus, or some other device and a custom ROM. Milton P. Agree 100% with you, I mean I remember the old days when I hated HTC's Sense, I literally decided that a phone without a camera was better than whatever HTC did back then, but Android has evolved quite a lot nowadays, don't get me wrong, I do believe that custom ROMs did a great job showing Google what the users want but that won't change, as long as someone shows Google what people want Google will keep improving Android, because there's no limits. Now if they go the Apple way and lock EVERYTHING then we'll be fucked, I'm the meantime developers will find a way around the system pushing Google along. Premsuraj An open bootloader and root actually solves a lot of problems still existing in AOSP. The Nougat update absolutely destoryed the battery life of many Nexus 6P devices, with Google only focussing on the Pixels, there was no fix in it. I unlocked, used Franco Kernel + naptime + Greenify and I now I get adequate battery life. Another feature I can think of is theming. Material design is good, but the whiteness is rage inducing Maxr1998 Well, fuck them. Let's just hope not many devs will use this, and Google won't enable this by default anytime soon. Maxr1998 The more I think about this, the more concerned I get. This will reduce the freedom over our devices, and also limit developers in the awesome things they could do before because of Android's openness. I am all in for device security and fighting against malware, trojans and phishing applications, don't understand me wrong, but that doesn't mean that you have to take people away their freedom - just look at how Linux (GNU and Linux) is doing it. Tom Westrick How does this limit developers? If anything it gives them more control. Maxr1998 Fair point, I should have been more specific. With "developers", I meant rom developers and modders, app developers only if they require root access for their apps. "Normal" developers can use this to enforce a "secure" (read: DRM locked-down) environment, but that's not really a good thing in my opinion.. (Refer to my other comments.) trparky You're angry at the wrong people, you should be angry at Hollywood; they're the ones that are demanding this kind of stuff. Their content, their rules; it's how things are in the real world. They have to do what they need to do to protect their investments, plain and simple. We don't necessarily have to like it, hell... we may even hate it, but that's how it is. You want the content? Play by their rules. Colin Richardson If you are an app developer and want your app to run on custom roms..... don't turn on "Requires SafetyNet"... bekifft We are increasingly living in the future Richard Stallman warned us about. With Google taking all these steps, may as well go back to using jailbroken iPhones. Bart Janusz I've already enabled it and I know at least 3 others devs that did it as well. I really don't care about root per se, but custom roms and xposed is source of countless problem as both are buggy as hell. Maxr1998 But in which way does that influence you? Xposed can introduce bugs to the system, sure, but it won't affect the performance of your app unless it itself is modded, so you probably don't have to fear bad reviews for bad performance anyway. And custom roms? LineageOS on my mother's Moto G runs like a champ and much better than the 5.1 stock rom before. And in my experience as a dev, there were much more incompatibilities with Samsung TouchWiz than with AOSP-based custom roms. refthemc I'm sure he's just trying to avoid the headache of emails he gets daily from users who have no idea that it's their fault the app is not working or crashing... Bart Janusz Indeed, not to mention extra crash and ANRs reports which seems to influence app positioning. Maxr1998 But why? The device may behave more buggy at some parts because of Xposed (and mine definitely ran like shit on MM because of some mods, but I NEVER blamed any apps), but the apps itself won't run worse if not modded - normally they should even run better if you only use performance mods like Greenify, NLP Collector wakelock disabler and other light mods. I don't think he gets many reports anyway, considering what @marcusmarcus2:disqus said. Bart Janusz You may not, but many users do, and as I said there are a lot of bogus ANRs and crash reports. Since my app depends heavily on low level OS elements both custom ROMs and xposed are deal breakers (and you really should check source, since I do not update my website as I moved to G+/FB but app has sizable user base given its niche and I'd to deal with ROM/xposed issues fequently). Maxr1998 Well, but the same type of users also give bad reviews etc. without using any mod or root. You generalize modders to only cause problems, and therefore lock out everyone. About your app/website thing: fair point, I didn't look at it yet, and have to apologize for being a little rude. marcusmarcus2 You need to take your own advice, "you really should check source". If you moved to G+/FB, then why does your app on the play store still point to the same website as well. Or at least put a link on the old website that directs to G+/FB. There is nothing that points to your so called G+/FB source. So @Maxr1998:disqus has no other source to check at the moment. Bart Janusz Not that I care but if you try to draw conclusion about app you should probably visit Play Store listing. Anyhow that's really not important I just chimed in to explain why developer will use this. I've choose to do so due to extra burden which in effect hurts majority of my user base, one of my colleagues cited lucky patcher and freedom (which I think is not such a good idea but its his choice). trparky You may not blame the apps because you know better but most people don't understand that, most people see a crashing app and suddenly you see, as the developer, a ton of comments saying that your app sucks. h4rr4r Please do tell us about your apps so we can be sure to avoid them on any devices we have not yet rooted. marcusmarcus2 His disqus profile leads to this website http://artflowstudio.com/ which has a few apps listed. Art oriented apps. There is only 1 update on that website since 2014, so I don't think I would be to concerned about installing one of his apps. Jordan Palmer Nice detective work. Adrian I can see a lot of refund requests coming from people who paid for apps and suddenly are told "Nope. Not for you anymore." A lot of us are rooted and buy apps and you'd better believe noise will be made if an app I use daily, that I paid for, suddenly breaks with an update because it's no longer blessed by the dev to run on my device. It's your app and you can do what you want with it, but there is always another side to the coin. BAlGaInTl That's not the way that Netflix worked it, and I doubt other developers of paid apps would either. I have a OnePlus One, that I run Lineage OS on since the original Cyanogen OS is now defunct and does not receive any updates. Netflix simply doesn't update to v 5+. It still works just fine. I may not get the newest and latest features, but part of that is on me for using a device that is dated. I'm not one of those users who, because I paid for an app once, fells that I should get all of the updates from now until the end of time. That isn't sustainable for developers. It could very well be that Netflix has some new features/offerings in the works in which they are getting pressure from outside sources to push this. A lot of valid reasons for a developer to enable the check exist. As long as they do it in the same manner that Netflix has, I don't see the issue. Adrian And just like Pokemon Go, eventually you'll get a message that you need to upgrade to the latest version or the app won't work, you know, that new version that won't let you actually log into it anymore. We've already seen this happen so let's not pretend that it isn't the next logical step. They aren't going to keep letting people sign in indefinitely with an app that doesn't have the security level they want. It's naive to think that hey I can just stick with the last version that works for root. It takes all of what, the time it takes to create a switch that says minimum version required to log in is "DRM version" BAlGaInTl Good Point. I recognize that. But it seems that the blame (in general) is being directed at Google in many of these posts. If that scenario happens, it isn't Google that blocked you from accessing Netflix. The need for this level of security is on the increase. The same users demanding better security and longer updates are the first ones to cry foul when Google starts laying the groundwork for exactly what they have asked for. Adrian I think there is a way to do both that doesn't piss off a very active community that helped take Android from a very very very ugly, second class OS to what we have now. I know a lot of us remember just how crippled Android was and it was the root/mod community that produced the bulk of what is now standard on Android. There needs to be a way to secure the devices AND not turn their back on the developer community that contributes. The idea, in Netflix's case, that root = pirate is insane. Why in the world would someone prefer to rip content on their phone to say a computer or XBox that is never going to move and can do it while you get on with your life? They're doing something for the sake of saying they're doing something, but if they think it's going to make a dent in piracy they, and the studios are nuts. I watch a lot of Netflix and still prefer to buy discs. People who do things the right way and are perfectly happy paying for content shouldn't have to jump through hoops to watch it. Those of us who root usually have a handful of things that stock Android is not doing for us. It's why we root. If all of these things were available in stock, my reasons for rooting would disappear but I don't see that happening any time soon. I think Android is getting so much better but if they make it exactly like iOS, might as well go to the dark side because Apple's apps tend to be more polished, come out first and OS updates are frequent. Don't bite the hand that feeds you just because you're getting more popular. BAlGaInTl I think that Netflix is a good example. It is HIGHLY likely that the reason for recent unpopular changes (see also VPN blocking) are being driven by other entities. It isn't that Netflix thinks its a problem, but the people that control a large portion of their content do. root pirate but it does introduce a security risk. I don't see how Google is turning their backs on developers. Developers are free to develop as they see fit and choose (at least for the moment) whether or not they will implement the SafetyNet check. The inherent problem is that a circumvented security is still circumvented and can no longer be considered secure. I can clearly see why some apps would and should frown upon that. Maybe not Netflix and Mario (IMHO), but certainly something like bank and payment apps. I don't think the inherent open nature of android will ever reduce to the level of iOS. But some changes have to occur to meet the needs/desire of the majority. Security is inherently difficult. The easier and more flexible you try to make it, the less secure it becomes. Adrian I do think banking apps should run in a secure space. Completely agree with that, but I disagree with root = less secure. My nexus devices stopped getting OS and security updates. Nothing. VERY insecure and dangerous. I rooted them, updated the OS with images from XDA developers and my devices that were once easy targets are more secure. There is always two sides to it. I see that Google is finally trying to take security seriously on Android and doing things in layers that completely cut out the vendor AND the carriers is the right step. Right now, Root is the only way to update a perfectly good device like my Nexus tablet tablet that the vendor said "oh well" to. Until Google has a REAL strategy in place to keep ALL Android devices secure, root will be necessary. Not everyone wants to or can upgrade devices every two years because they get abandoned. My father doesn't need an S8. He does need a device that gets security updates for more than a year after purchasing his phone. BAlGaInTl You are exactly correct, and I'm in the same situation with my OnePlus One. But in working to increase your security level, you leave holes behind. The key words that you used are "more secure." I agree. You are "more secure." But still (probably) less secure than a device that has been thoroughly tested, certified, and passes SafetyNet without hacks. Google has been open that they are working on security updates. They have improved significantly over the last couple years in getting those out. I feel that they are putting in place a real strategy to keep Android devices secure. This is part of that groundwork. I also feel that they are actively looking to replace Android in it's current state, and I can't say I blame them. The only real strategy may be to take lessons learned and start over. Lucky for them, they have the resources to do so. trparky > take lessons learned and start over Pretty much. The worst thing that they did from the very beginning was to allow for the OEMs to do what they wished. Google essentially made a deal with the devil when they released Android to the world. They wrote no requirements into the Android agreements that the OEMs agreed to to require updates to be a necessary thing. Big mistake Google. BAlGaInTl The really needed to in order to get their foot in the door of the market. If it would not have been open source from the beginning, none of the major manufactures would have bought off on it. The fact that they could use it for free (essentially) and still be able to customize on top of it is what sold it. trparky And now look at it, Android is a fucking mess of non-updated insecure devices that are ripe for anyone to be able to take over and turn into a botnet. trparky And you should be raising holy hell with the OEM that made that device! Just because your device is old doesn't mean that it shouldn't still be supported. Windows 7 is nearly eight years old and it still receives Windows Updates. Why can't your device? BAlGaInTl Normally, I would agree, but the OnePlus One is a special case. The OEM operating system is the now defunct Cyanogen OS. I had to balance having the original OS without updates, or running another with updates. The phone is now almost three years old. If I bought a PC with Windows on it three years ago, and Microsoft had since gone out of business, should the PC manufacturer be responsible for providing Windows 7 updates? Even though the PC is beyond it's support date? Sure, I can increase the security by switching to another OS that is updated. It may even be a Windows clone. But if a software developer decided to only support "original, unmodified" PC configurations, that would be within their right. trparky But it can be adapted to run LineageOS. Sudev There is bit difference in analogy here: OnePlus manufactured the phone and Cynogen Inc customized AOSP Android OS for it, they didn't developed it from ground up. I understand that Cynogen INC is out of business now too. However in PC world, it would be the case that you purchased a PC from Dell and get Microsoft Windows OS with some additional Dell software. If Dell or developer of that custom software goes out of business you still get OS update for your PC. Its not android OS itself out business here. Adrian and for the record, I absolutely agree that it was the content providers and not all on Netflix. trparky You should be demanding that OnePlus send an official update to your device. So what if your device is old? It should be still supported. Windows 7 is still supported nearly eight years later, why can't your device be supported for that long as well? Plumplam Who cares except for a bunch of XDA nerds? If it means better security then I'm all for it. Dmitri Smirnov Well, for starters, it doesn't mean better security, since it does nothing to address the problems with vulnerable outdated android versions that will be "certified", but will allow malicious apps to quietly escalate their privileges and do their dirty work, but will block "uncertified" custom roms that actually have all the recent secuirity patches and give user full control over who has root access and how. Also, "bunch of XDA nerds" are the source of a lot of features that had their trial run in custom ROMs and then were adopted to the AOSP. Should I remind you of "The Oak and the Pig" fable? Alienate the developers bringing new ideas to the ecosystem - lose the competetive edge you had over other OSes saf1927 Actually, custom ROMs never really have the latest security patches despite what they claim since kernels aren't maintained and no proprietary blobs is updated anymore. If ROM developers were OEMs, they'd be violating their agreements with Google by bumping the patch level without actually addressing all the vulnerabilities. Dmitri Smirnov Well they patch the AOSP to the same level as latest official one and kernel - if it's possible to do so without breaking the compatibility with compiled blobs or at least on the level of latest official firmware. So in the end run it's at least as secure as the official firmware, often - much more so. saf1927 If you look at the security bulletin, most vulnerabilities come from proprietary drivers and require these to be updated. On a supported device, these are provided by the chip manufacturers to the OEMs, on an unsupported device they aren't updated anymore. A custom ROM can only fix userspace security issues. In the end, bumping the patch level without addressing all vulnerabilities in that patch gives a false sense of security to users. Dmitri Smirnov If anything, this is an argument for forcing OEMs to opensource their blobs. For some reason community is much better at releasing the fixes for what they can change (userspace), while OEMs generally stop caring as soon as device is out the door. saf1927 The problem goes beyond OEMs unfortunately. All the phones you can buy are assembled with off-the-shelf components that they buy from other manufacturers and it is them that provide the binary blobs to the OEMs. If they stop supporting components, the OEMs can't do anything. For the chip, it's companies like Qualcomm, Samsung, Mediatek etc. that need to support it with up-to-date drivers. Once they stop, the life-cycle of a phone comes to an end. trparky And that is probably one of many reason why Qualcomm is facing a nice fat anti-trust lawsuit. Serves them right. trparky That ain't ever going to happen. There's no way they're going to allow for their intellectual property to be open for all the world to see and have it cracked open. It would be corporate suicide since their competitors would be able to reverse engineer their stuff. Suicide_Note Never heard of "The Oak and the Pig" before. Could you tell me more? Seriously. Dmitri Smirnov http://www.aliceswonderland.eu/Alice-ska350-en.html Maxr1998 Ah, Lessing. Going to read the original version in a minute :) username_not_valid Thats a very generous view of the custom ROM community. It might be true of a few, very few devs, but most ROMs are unsupported garbage with serious security issues. Dmitri Smirnov Maybe so, but out of this cesspool of garbage CyanogenMod was born, which became LineageOS. I'd say their quality standard appeals me more than a lot of OEMs. username_not_valid Cyanogen and Lineage was what i had in mind.. Each to his own i guess. BAlGaInTl Yes and no. I run Lineage on my OnePlus One because Cyanogen OS is no longer supported. I can say with certainty that Lineage introduces stability issues that I have to deal with to be up to date. Wilton Daniel Pinto Ninna pooty bewarci Qwip Consider the bigger picture. Right now, users are being shuffled into a situation where they must restrict the control they have over their device if they want to be able to use Netflix (and presumably banking apps will follow soon). That may seem fine, and from some security perspective it is probably a good thing. How much control do you have over your _laptop_? How much do you want? Right now, we're blissfully able to install unsigned software on our computers (although various OSs will complain about it), but will that last? How long will it be before we can only open our banking interface on our laptop using a trusted, digitally signed browser on a machine that is using secure boot and can only run signed binaries? I can understand the direction that Netflix (and others) are coming from, and to them it may even make sense. The question is: what is the cost of ceding control over our devices/machines in order to be able to watch netflix, etc. trparky Yeah and that's why Windows is the virus filled cesspool that it is today. Windows 10 is slowly changing Windows to be an app store based ecosystem in which all apps will be sandboxed. It's coming to the desktop near you. saf1927 I hope Magisk (or other similar mods in the future) keep working, so to prevent this. Not a problem on my Pixel XL since I haven't rooted it, but on my Nexus 5 Magisk allows it to pass Safety Net even though it's running a custom ROM (7.1.2) and it's rooted. Hendrik Leppkes SafetyNets primary purpose is to secure devices for Android Pay, and when you deal with actual money transactions on your device, you really don't want any hack interfering with it - so I'm quite certain they'll do whatever they can to break hacks like this and ensure the security and integrity of the device. h4rr4r No, its primary purpose is to make the device trustworthy for others not the person who paid for it. This is how it makes it "secure" for android pay. You are a possible threat and this closes that. Suicide_Note It would seem that Google is erecting a wall around their garden, too. EowynCarter While Apple opens iOS more and more. YouNex According to the support/help page, a device is not certified if it stops getting Android updates. How fuck up is that ? I don't get it. My Moto X has always been on stock ROM, yet it's showing up as non certified. Yes it's rooted + system modifications, but at no point is it stated that root prevents it from being certified. Suicide_Note Really? You can't understand why your rooted/system modified device is non-certified? YouNex I know how to read, but this is vague https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png "Not secure" jonzey231 Root and/or unlocked bootloader = Not certified. YouNex It says nothing about root or bootloader https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png ast00 Can't wait until LastPass excludes root users... Fuck them. Adonis K. If they do, I'm cancelling my subscription... Naxx ENVY Fuck them and yet they haven't done anything yet ... #internetlogic Also i know right , crazy for a company that stores your passwords to make themselves more secure . ABSOLUTE CRAZY , RAGE RAGE RAGE Jordan Palmer I don't understand your reasoning or rationale for these two statements. ast00 The second part is related to Google. Sorry about the confusion. Believe it or not, most of us root users keep SELinux in it's Enforcing state. This means we are safe. Nothing gets root rights without us knowing. Our phones are just as safe if not safer than most stock phones. JATIN BANSAL SafetyNet test can be passed using Magisk Manager. I am using it and it works fine for me. Even in play store, my device is certified. May be this helps someone. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3756499ff5876545740cd0e88e38961bb2c327d90fc43f5801f4bce5d802c990.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/44185f640490cb506a68a3414579bd345123f7d52ee2e11802d31d5141db11ae.png Nick Most people are worried about the future when the exploits that Magisk uses are patched and it continues to make it harder for people to get around this. JATIN BANSAL That's what I am also worried about. I just posted this for those who are already rooted and for now want to keep the root. My main purpose of rooting was to flash lineage OS. I think custom rom is the only way of staying updated to latest version of Android as google itself doesn't update their phones after 2 years (18 months I think) for reasons they have. I think if someone buys a flagship device which costs 700$+, it should have 3-4 years of full software update support. 😆😄 2 years of major OS version updates and 3 years of security patches. After 3 years, its time to buy a new phone cuz its so old anyway. trparky Says you! Windows 7 was released on July 22, 2009 and they still support it EIGHT YEARS LATER! And they plan on supporting it until the year 2020 which means it will be supported for a total of ELEVEN YEARS! If Microsoft can do it, Google can too!!! Does Microsoft suddenly say "Your machine is too old, go buy a new one"? No, they continue to give you Windows Updates for years later. We should also be demanding that the Android OEMs do so as well. A Samsung Note 5 has more than enough hardware in it to run Android 7 but no... we can't do that, we need to make money so we don't update them to force you to buy a new device. Lambdadelta Magisk...alright, thanks for the tip-off. I really must get it. TadMSTR Magisk doesn't always pass SafetyNet. I have some devices it fails on. However, several other devices it works just fine. Make sure you turn on the hide root option, it's off by default. Lambdadelta Well, I do have a problem, and that is my device is not able to download it directly from Google Play, so I have to get the APK from XDA. I dunno why this is the case for my phone though. Is it because it's a 4.4.4? Either way, I'll get the APK moved to my phone later tonight. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson I have activated hide root option, and it passes SafetyNet, but in Google Play Store, it still shows uncertified. What app should I hide root from to get Play Store to show Certified? JATIN BANSAL As per XDA: Q: Safety Net fails after enabling MagiskHide A: Magisk can only hide Magisk core features, for Magisk modules it depends on what the module does. If your ROM itself is not able to pass SafetyNet, then there is nothing Magisk can help. Your best bet is 100% stock ROMs, because your phone manufacturer is forced to release a device passing CTS. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson What in Magisk Hide did you check/how did you do it? Google Play Store? Or Play services? Because here it says uncertified :( JATIN BANSAL Just clear app data of play store. Now it will show your device certified Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson Thanks! Muzaffar I believe that root and custom rom makes android what it is now. This feels like betrayal for Android enthusiast. username_not_valid Well maybe in the very early days (maybe), but not any more. Rooted phones make up a tiny fraction of active devices. Muzaffar It's not about active devices. It's about how android develop together with community (well as i remember) I believe that those "rooted user" contribute many things that make android right now. I still remember status bar (and nav bar) color change was implemented on Kitkat before it becomes official on lollipop. Also, we can't forget how badly mobile active network bug happens in lollipop if it's not those "rooted user" who found out the fix via xposed. and i believe there are still more. trparky We can blame the OEMs for that kind of stuff because of things like locked bootloaders, eFuses, etc. username_not_valid Or we can blame ROM makers for it because they kept breaking the devices causing warranty claims. Naxx ENVY no offence but that's small thinking ... i'd say 90% of people on Android devices don't want or even know about root, heck it may even be 95% ... security is more of a concern, sure it annoys us geeks, but that's the 5% at most. Muzaffar And about half of android devices is left outdated. Not to mention bugs that unsolved on previous android. I'll pick a dumb phone instead, if android becomes a closed platform. trparky And truth be told that's why I have an iPhone. I simply got sick and tired of the lack of updates so I told myself I'm going to the iPhone and have been happy ever since. OK sure, it may not have all of the customization features that Android has but I can be guaranteed that I will get software and security updates on time, every time, regardless of my carrier of choice. refthemc I think you misread his comment, he's saying that root and custom roms got Android to where it is TODAY not saying that it is necessary TODAY. And I agree. trparky It pretty much comes down to this. Google is simply targeting a much larger piece of the pie. You can't blame them for trying to do what is necessary to protect not only the platform but the Android brand itself. Qwip Well, it isn't like there is anywhere else to go though, is it? Google can basically throw enthusiasts who have promoted and fostered android development under the bus - they don't need them any more. trparky Money trumps community. Always has, always will. username_not_valid Ad blocking was the last holdout reason to root for me, but even thats no longer a good reason with things like Adhell, Adguard etc I have no other reason to root now, custom ROMs are generally garbage, and bloat can usually be uninstalled or disabled, so its just not needed. Adonis K. custom ROMs have nothing to do with root... thevigilante Custom ROMs have uncertified flag in Play Store Mike Avellanosa Not all, though George Byers My Nexus 7 2013 is passing safteynet running Lineage unrooted. Wilton Daniel Pinto Let me guess, you have a Pixel. Or you wouldn't call custom ROMs bloated while the reality is other way round username_not_valid Wouldn't touch a Pixel actually. username_not_valid Should be noted that I didn't call custom ROMs bloated, I guess you misread it. Wilton Daniel Pinto Oh yeah, I misread it . My bad Zach Mauch This is going to cause the same problem I see in governments work with security. They will blindly block things like root and bootloader unlock regardless of if it poses any credible threat because it FEELS more secure. Blah!!!!!! Naxx ENVY it IS more secure, not just " feels" h4rr4r More secure for them, not for me the owner of the device. Besides, not even for them in the long term. An up to date ROM has many exploits patched that a two versions out of date and 12 months behind on security patches OTA has. Zach Mauch What I mean is they will apply restrictions because they easily can and it gives a warm fuzzy for them. They will do this regardless of the impact to the user. The analogy here is that in my job I am constantly unnecessary restrictions and bureaucracy that make doing my job much more difficult. For instance, we are disallowed from using remote desktop on standalone computer networks. It would make our job MUCH MUCH easier in many circumstances and save money on software as I could remote into my PC from anywhere in the building. Yet they deny us that and claim security. jonzey231 So this will force people to install apps from unauthorized sources, thus making the whole Android malware issue that much more prevalent. Great.. Suicide_Note Unless being held at gunpoint, no one is forced to install apps from unauthorized sources. That's a user's CHOICE. jonzey231 You know what I mean. Stop playing devil's advocate on everyone's posts. Eric Braun He's not incorrect. Kyle R Krcmaric "Stop providing an alternate viewpoint to my own." It's just comments. Anyway, I think Google also announced that even sideloaded apps will get scanned by their new Google Play Protect service, which may help nullify the risk of sideloading in the first place. d0x360 That's not an alternate viewpoint unless your view is "don't install any apps ever" There is no logical argument to defend this move by Google. None. username_not_valid Yes there is. Come content creators will not allow a provider to support a rooted or otherwise compromised device. Right or wrong in your eyes thats the reality, and in order for Android to be able to have such services Google have to do this. d0x360 What you said isn't an alternate viewpoint lol you are just repeating the reason Google is doing this which everyone agrees is a fact. As for this new comment...a rooted phone isn't compromised. Tell me...what would a rooted user do with Netflix that would make Netflix want to block them? Are they worried about people copying movies because if they think Android is the vector for that action they are idiots. All they are doing is making a problem by allowing bad actors to inject malware into a Netflix apk that could be installed by both root and unrooted users. Genius! Give me 1 good reason to block rooted phones from an app like oh I dunno, Mario run or whatever it's called. Any answers you give are false. Wanna know why? Hacked apks exist to allow cheating and they can be installed by anyone rooted or not. In fact I'd stake my life that your average unrooted user is installing more modified apk files to cheat in games or whatever than any rooted user. People who root are generally better educated about the Android eco system and do less dumb stuff. As for Netflix I cancelled my account on the day they did this and now I just use a friends account so they lost a subscriber due to this move and I rarely ever used the app. Sure 1 person closing an account that's existed since the day they opened isn't going to do much but I vote with my wallet and if a company does something I dislike then they simply don't get my money. The first person I asked gave me their login info and I made a profile. It's just like how I share my HBO subscription with someone else. Easy easy. username_not_valid See my previous comment. Its not for me to argue, the fact is content providers want it, fair or not, end of story, therefore its going to happen. The tiny number of rooters out there are meaningless to them, and Google. Netflix has to do this because the providers of its non-original content demand it. Its not Netflix fault, they either do it or lose shows. Losing large amounts of their content would affect their subscription base several orders of magnitude more than losing rooted users, who chances are, use the service on more than their phone or tablet anyway. d0x360 Once again I ask... what about a rooted device is dangerous to an app and also this is now a second question, what makes it compromised? BAlGaInTl Clearly you've made up your mind on the issue, but I'll give it a go. It isn't necessarily the root that is dangerous to an app or vice versa. The compromise comes from other apps/processes that can take advantage of root. If you don't understand that, then you don't understand what root really is. It has a lot of valuable uses, but it can also be dangerous. To address your previous statement, just because it rubs me the wrong way. So your "solution" was to cancel your Netflix account and then steal the content? So clearly, you aren't "actually" affected by the change, because you can still watch Netflix. You do realize that watching their content is also valuable to them and makes them money? If you want to boycott Netflix for their practices, then by all means do. Otherwise, it just comes across as hypocritical IMHO. d0x360 I don't believe I asked you. No I'm not stealing Netflix content, it's being paid for and Netflix has many times in the past encouraged account sharing. Of course they did so in the hopes you would join but they still allow it. I paid my Netflix dues. Day 1 4 disc member, then as soon as it was available I upgraded to the 4k 4 user package. It's not piracy either, I'm not recording or distributing the content. If Netflix wants to dick with me I'll dick with them. I never said this was permanent but I vote with my wallet. Vote cast. I also haven't used Netflix once since that day despite being able to. I've been using Amazon and Microsoft video where I own over 500 movies so you can stuff the whole theft argument. I've bought more content than most and that doesn't include my DVD, Blu-ray, and uhd Blu-ray collection which is well over 1400 movies and TV shows at this point. Your right...I've been rooting since the first Android phone but I totally don't understand the possibilities. My argument is simple. The overwhelming majority of root users don't mess with apps. To hell with that nonsense argument anyways. What is the danger to Netflix? Copying movies? Please...it's a million times easier to do it on a PC. Even windows xp can handle it without issue. Does Netflix and you I suppose really think root users are using the app to steal content? If so how? Show me one forum topic, one article, one modified Netflix apk that allows downloading and bypassing their drm. I'm begging you. Just 1. BAlGaInTl I reviewed the Netflix TOS, and I will agree that you are not stealing. I'll even remove the verbiage from my post. Netflix does not make any such stipulation. They speak only of the "Account Owner" and "Devices." I guess I just assumed that, and that's my bad. As I've said in other posts... It isn't all about Netflix. A large part of it is about their content. They really can't argue that point with providers. You either play by their rules, work to establish new rules, or choose not to carry them. Netflix wants to stay relevant on all platforms. That's the main danger to Netflix. In addition, I shouldn't have to give an example in the wild of an exploit. Just because it is difficult to find doesn't mean it doesn't exist. What if someone else writes an app that uses root to mine user account data from Netflix? Should Netflix not be worried about protecting user data? If that happens, who is responsible for the security and the bad press? Probably not Netflix, but they would certainly be impacted. I checked my app really quick (which is stuck on version 4 because I'm affected). Since Netflix keeps you logged in for convenience (that's spelled out in their terms), a quick look gives my full name, username, phone number, zip code, the brand of payment card, and the last 4 digits of that card. That's quite a bit of information that can easily be gathered by a piece of Malware. Now as I said... Netflix probably wouldn't be liable if a user was compromised because of root. It would certainly be a danger to their business however. Why should the be asked to take that risk? It seems to me that they are approaching this in a realistic manner, and rolling it out in a reasonable way. Would this affect the majority of root users? Probably not. By their nature, root users will find ways around it anyway. The problem is that the impact to Netflix from losing content and/or a compromised app is disproportionate the loss of blocking root users. It's simply a numbers game, and you can't blame Netflix for that. And you certainly can't blame Google who is trying to improve security. username_not_valid Thats not for me to decide, or argue, the fact is the content providers have decided that rooting is a risk to their copyrighted content, and as such services like Netflix, Amazon, and other streaming services must comply and lock out rooted devices. Passing safetynet and using Googles DRM framework is the easiest way to claim due diligence, so thats what they will do, and in order to keep Android competitive Google is providing the tools needed to make it possible. What I will argue though is that your notion that custom ROMs etc are more secure is unfounded. The best might well be, but there are hundreds of completely random and unchecked ROMs out there that could contain absolutely anything, you cant possibly claim that custom ROMs are inherently safer or more secure than OEM ROMs, outdated or not. jonzey231 So let's play this out: If someone takes the Netflix .apk and mods it with malware and then signs it, it will pass installation on the device. 1. User opens app. 2. App does whatever shitty thing it's designed to do while the user thinks they just got around the block. 3. The OS scans the app and warns the user it's been modified and they should uninstall it. 4. User thinks "Ha! I know and that's why it works!" 5. User keeps app until they get a call from Credit Karma that their identity was probably stolen but they don't know how. 6. Person spends 6 months fixing stolen identity. But still uses that app the whole time. Ultimately, that user is still going to be screwed. Would you or I make this mistake? No. Would your cousin's friend's dad because he had his son root so he could tether for free and overheard you guys talking about sideloading apps and googled how to do it? Yes. Randroid Problem is, even in your scenario, root has nothing to do with it. Someone who is not rooted could do the same thing. The only problem is, now MORE people who root are going to be *forced* to look for a modified apk because the official apk is not available from the Play Store. So in the end, it's causing more problems than it's fixing. Corbin Baxter Here's the thing about rooting: when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. This just helps discourage rooting, which can alter a new users perspective on Android, or make someone reconsider getting an Android device. someone755 For what it's worth, back in 2011/2010, many of us bought into Android *because* we could root. Imagine the possibilities of being in control of so much more of your system than with any mobile OS prior; We've spent hundreds (some, thousands) of dollars in this environment, on devices, apps, books etc. I understand this isn't how things stand nowadays, but root is still prevalent because of one issue that Google will not fix (or at least, won't until O+ is running on the majority of devices, but that'll take two years at the minimum), and those are updates and vendor apps (i.e. bloatware). If my phone is stuck on Lollipop I'm going to root it; I'll be able to mitigate the memory leak performance drops, and overall customize the device to fit my specific needs -- I've made quite a few friends (think ROM and kernel devs) because I just wanted to put a thermal engine better than Qualcomm's horrendous MPDecision into the kernel directly (i.e. I took the kernel source and modified it to fit my needs). What Google is trying to do here is, yes, discourage rooting, but instead of fixing the root cause (heh) behind why people root in the first place (that is, again, customizability and personal(ized) performance tuning, in large part to keep devices on older Android versions alive), root wouldn't be necessary. In the long run this *might* fix the symptom, but it most definitely will not help in fixing the cause. And that's because the cause is Google itself. As if apps like Snapchat blocking power users from their apps wasn't enough, now there's this -- If it becomes so common that even Google's own apps start to utilize the feature, I'll be gone to another mobile platform within a month. That might mean iOS, it might mean S60v3, I'll know that if (or rather, when) it happens. tl;dr: Google is putting a band-aid on a shotgun wound. Corbin Baxter I'm speaking mainly for new Android users. They don't feel as comfortable rooting. Doing this makes Android SEEM more like iOS. This doesn't MAKE Android like iOS. New users are comfortable with that. This is the same issue Microsoft had with Windows 8/8.1. Classic users, and Windows enthusiasts, hated someone changing the way they would use their computers. Microsoft introduced a different way of doing things, and to enthusiasts, it was bad, no matter how good it might be. Google's Project Treble should mostly fix the fragmentation problem, therefore giving Android users one less reason to root. To us enthusiasts, nothing can beat rooting, but it might not be the best solution to the problems Android has. Google seems intent on fixing the problems rooting tries to solve, but in a higher-quality and reliable way. No hard feelings😉 trparky They won't understand that, they're too blinded by their geek rose colored glasses. Corbin Baxter I don't expect everyone to understand, but I'll be happy if even a small handful understand what Google is doing here. someone755 I don't think that's true -- new Android users will soon enough become old ones, and with that they'll learn that the platform (especially update-wise) is a mess without some system privileges beyond those needed to change the display brightness. Not being to use the core functions of the ecosystem that we pay to use because we decide we deserve to have more control over the devices we pay for is absolutely on Apple's level, if not made worse because of the implication that this OS is somehow different from iOS. Windows Vista was a revolutionary piece of software, and people hated it. Why? Because what was expected from Microsoft was both huge change as well as keeping everything as it is -- and Vista was exactly that: an OS modern enough to be the core basis for Windows 7, and an inspiration for features several years into the future (Vista pioneered almost every feature that W7 had), with many similarities to Windows XP. But naturally because of the expectations, the OS failed miserably, being fondly remembered by nobody (with the exception of a few people, including myself). The ones who vote and voice their opinion are not always the brightest of people. Google's Treble is sure to mitigate Android's fragmentation *to some extent*, but it'll take several years for it to reach the majority of devices (based on the data that Nougat, today, works on 10% of devices, including custom ROM-ed ones, which, when talking about custom Android O ROMs, won't count towards the number of devices supporting Treble). We can't say this is unexpected -- after all, Google does bring features into Android that enthusiasts developed before official implementation. But this is a moot point if we consider that these things usually take at least three years. Tethering, using camera flash as a torch, quick settings and editing quick settings, even night light -- these are all root features that, when first introduced, were community hacks to improve Android devices, and they are all part of Google's Android (AOSP, even) today. If Google discourages rooting, they discourage development of future Android features, which are, historically, largely taken from the operating system's community of developers and enthusiasts. If that is how things must be in pursuit of a false sense of security and tighter control over the platform in the hopes of improving its quality, so be it. But saying that this is the platform I once adored is false -- if anything, this is its polar opposite; something we knew back in 2011 as "iOS". Corbin Baxter Android can still be rooted, and I don't think that Google is going to take that away. someone755 They aren't taking away the ability to root, no. They are, however, taking away the incentive to root, as well as root users' access to services they pay (or have paid) for. Dmitri Smirnov > when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. As if right now Google or the OEMs are in any ways responsible for the malware or unpatched firmware vulnerabilities that stay this way for year. But yes, the users that root are the problem. Corbin Baxter For unrooted phones, yes Google and OEMs are very responsible. But after you root, Android loses most of its security and stability, and rooting is basically tinkering with core system files. Google doesn't have any control over what the user can or can't do after that. someone755 I respectfully disagree. There is no loss in stability aside from the forced Knox/SafetyNet/whatever software alerts from OEMs and Google, and there's definitely no loss in security -- if anything, the system is more secure because of my control over apps' privileges (i.e. I am free to control what apps do on my device, including stopping data theft by apps like Facebook etc). Why Google would have to be responsible for what a person does with their phone is beyond me -- the warranty doesn't cover it, and there are warnings of dos and don'ts plastered most everywhere online. (I'd very much like to say here that if you can't follow simple instructions you should go back to using tin cans on a string, but I realize that way 90% of the population would be excluded from the money making machine.) Simply put, I don't understand why Google would care over what the user can or can't do, as long as the user isn't somehow hurting the company (which, with root alone, they aren't and can't). Corbin Baxter You have a good point... bekifft That wasn't even a devil's advocate, that was a straight up strawman. Frosted Butts Yes.. please tell me about all the Netflix alternatives i can install, that can legally stream from Netflix...... Right now, if i am rooted and want Netflix (a service i am paying for), i must go through 3rd party app stores to install the APK. There is no choice at all... R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Umm you have the choice to unroot your device. Maxr1998 ..which is a bad choice for many. d0x360 Yes you do except I rooted my device to make it MORE secure. Unrooting would make my device less secure than sideloading apps would. username_not_valid People can keep saying that, but the content providers have no way to know whether or not you have taken measures to secure your custom device, whereas if they go down this root they know its handled. BAlGaInTl "whereas if they go down this root they know its handled" I see what you did there. 😆😄 ...or just watch Netflix from Chrome! You could even do this from a Linux box with root! 😃 Suicide_Note Sure there is: unroot. Problem solved. neoKushan "I've solved this problem by creating 3 more problems - but it IS solved!" Eric Braun https://www.amazon.com/Netflix-Inc/dp/B005ZXWMUS Option C .. ?? h4rr4r A choice that is now more popular. dcdttu It's not so much about what a user chooses to do. It's about probability. The probability that sites are going to try to lure users into downloading malware-infected Netflix APKs from 3rd party sites is going to go up if you can't download it from a safe source in the first place. This is just like the fact that, if you don't give drug users a safe and clean place to shoot up, they're going to go do it somewhere else that's much more dangerous. Both of these scenarios are bad for society in general, no matter what the original intention was. kgptzac 1/10. Gotta try harder. My1 if you are rooted and wanna watch netflix on mobile, you have not much choice. Suicide_Note Sure you do. Unroot, or use Magisk to hide root. My1 unroot isnt always a choice for a firewall or being better at taking permissions away. and magisk, well does it work everywhere, I certainly dont know. and if youhave opened your bootloader, you would need to close it again if you want to go stock again which on some devices triggers a data wipe. Premsuraj How? Google Play Protect will still catch malicious apps makapav Yes but you're potentially making people venture through shady sites to get the APKs. Eric Braun Or to Amazons App store or Fdroid. The people going to shady sites are already going there, this isn't going to increase the traffic by any real amount. tehboogieman Are you sure that Google will continue allowing GPP for unlocked or rooted users going forward? Not to mention that it's not a silver bullet for 0days d0x360 It barely works as is. There are tons of apps that slip through every day. Krebs on security reports on them quite frequently. I don't trust Google's scanning of apps at all which is why I root. I can make my phone more secure and I can also image the device as often as I want so if something does happen it's fixed within 5 min. If I unroot then I lose the protection along with the backups. Premsuraj Custom ROMs and root can't protect from 0days either. And just out of curiosity how is root going to provide more security? If anything it makes the device less secure tehboogieman Nobody said root makes a device more secure. Blocking root users from downloading apps from the Play Store puts users at more risk since those users will be more inclined to sideload apps from sources that might not be as reliable as the Play Store. Premsuraj The only people who cares about this are the people who root. And those user's generally tend to be more knowledgeable about what kind of apps and app stores they can trust. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And only <2% of users will do this to keep rooted. xxTheGoDxx Only the plus 50 - 100 Million users that have root: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.chainfire.supersu ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You do realize that that's just downloads right? ...not active users. blindexecutioner I'm not mad. I continue to use things like magisk to help get around stuff like this. All this will do is encourage me to use unauthorized sources for offending apps if magisk ever stops working. There is a reason I use Android over iOS and it certainly isn't because the apps are better designed or whatever. brian. Magisk is a good way around this. However, I don't know how long this will last. I would think with security in mind and developers trying to monetize more, it will put pressure on Google to make SafetyNet get triggered much easier. Obviously, I don't have any way of knowing, but this could easily turn into a cat and mouse game more than it already is. Android Pay was first, other apps did it like Super Mario Run, which who cares, but now Netflix? Changes are coming, and it doesn't look good for the rooting community. D13H4RD2L1V3 I'm not sure if everyone gets why some of us went through the trouble of gaining SU access. Sure, maybe there's a few who went through all that trouble for nefarious purposes (and maybe that got regulatory bodies concerned to the point where Google even needed to consider this) but from my perspective at least, a lot of us gain Superuser access mainly to get features that we liked on other Android flavors, especially in the case of a build of Android that's very close to Google's vision. Such as the ability to hide the navbar at any time we wanted and also to gain theming support (which I feel should be added officially sooner rather than later because I absolutely hate how Google is making their already-bright UI even more eye-searing with even more white-colored elements, which also makes the benefits of OLED much less obvious). I wouldn't be as concerned if these features were pushed to AOSP soon, but as it stands, I feel that Google should probably think about making these features available soon. Marty Thank the bad apples for why you no longer have freedom. Jeremy ディリマ Would changing region firmware with Odin flag the SafetyNet check on Samsung mobiles? Soz if it's a stupid question a lot has changed since I last fiddled with Android Christopher Robert This was a long time coming. Once root user started using root to pirate software, and/or get around geo locks, instead of using it to add feature to their firmware or improve their devices performance, it was only a matter of time before it all got torn down. h4rr4r Get around geo locks? You mean have my device report the location I want it to report? Yeah, how terrible that I control what my computer does. dizel123 You still do. This doesn't affect that at all h4rr4r You said the justification for that was people using their devices for their own reasons in the way they liked. I was pointing out that this is a normal thing and not something that should be punished. Cuvis You don't need root to pirate. You never did. Marty Apple says, Thank you. h4rr4r Sounds like we need a new FREE platform. Maybe Amazon can use this to push their store. mxwp but will the Netflix from the Amazon App Store work on rooted phones? Curt RIP Root. I'm not moving from stock anymore, just cab with the hassle. Until there's a 'reliable' way to hide from Safety Net, I'll enjoy my Android Pay, banking apps and overall smoothness. (If it was up to me, I'd be rooted with Linage) h4rr4r IOS is the platform for you. That was the deal from the beginning. hp-fourtwenty magisk....giyf .y phone is rooted with lineage 14.1, and passes safetynet. problem solved! jcopernicus Fantastic news. Lawstorant All this butthurt for what? You all sound like Magisk doesn't exist. Dave Hamilton Lets take Apple and there closed source. Lets take Google and there open source, the freedom to do and change as you please to make the device yours. No two devices have to be the same. Lets get 115 million android users, and then start deciding you no longer have this choice and freedom to do what you want! When something gets better and better, its only a matter of time before all the things you love are removed and comersilised Eric Braun You still have the option to do what you want. However like everything there are reactions for every action. Want to root or unlock your device? Sure, however there may be a few apps that no longer appear in the playstore. May want to have a backup like Amazon App Store or something similar ready. No one is stopping you, feel free to do as you please. tehboogieman Man, if I have to choose between having a device with root or a device with apps that use day to day, the iPhone goes from a 1% chance of being my daily driver to about 50% There are still a lot that can Android can do that iOS can't, but if I'm living in a walled garden the iPhone is looking pretty attractive. 5+ years of official OS support, solid retail network for quick service or hardware exchanges. The Play Store is my main source of apps that I know are vetted and generally safe. I have no desire to manage app updates manually. There is always a chance that someone will build and maintain an appstore that will have all root blocked apps (maybe the future of APKMirror?). If not it might be the death of Android for users like me Eric Braun Even without all of this I would use an APKMirror App that allowed for updating of apps automatically. dizel123 Google gives app developers more control over their apps. Whiny entitled internet crybabies go on the internet and whine and cry. Aka...Thursday neoKushan Alternatively: Google restricts users from using their device, which they own, how they see fit. dizel123 Except Google isn't restricting anyone from doing anything. But being 100% wrong has never stopped anyone in the internet NubCake being an asshole (in your case) hasn't stopped anyone from commenting eather it seems. dizel123 I can admit to being an asshole. But I'm also right so it's all good. neoKushan It's certainly not stopping you. dizel123 I haven't experienced it so of course it's not stopping me trparky You may own the hardware but you don't own the software, you only have a license to use it. Csöpi Thats so greate. I have a stock oneplus one and for some strange reasons i was failing the test beforhand, but now its all green. Still cant update the netflix app hence chromecast isnt working either anymore. Not really happy. JC If there's a will there's a way. brian. If more developers get on board with this, I can't see why I would switch to Android. I've always been curious about new Android phones, bought a bunch and rooted them all if I could. This is not good for a person like me. d0x360 If Google keeps this up and app devs include the api to block rooted phones then my days using Android will be over and Google will have lost a user who's been there since the g1. I don't know what I'd switch to... probably windows mobile because I'm not a fan of apple whatsoever. It's really a shame because if I had to guess I'd say 99.99% of people who root do so for either the added security and or customized experiences. For example I use root to modify my status bar and quick panel as well as firewall my apps and use adaway and yes Google I do whitelist sites that aren't obnoxious with their ads. John Doe All the more reason for the APK mirror appstore LoL Jan-Lk Else Yeah Google want's us to buy tooooo expensive phones to just get the latest Android, because cheap phones suck at updates and so they need to be flashed and rooted... trparky But if the community raises holy hell with the OEMs then maybe it will be corrected. There's no damn reason why a three year old device can't be updated when an eight year old Windows 7 machine is still receiving Windows Updates. Jan-Lk Else OEMs don't care about customers, they care about money. And with Windows the OEMs don't need to provide updates themselves. trparky So why should I care about them? Why should I buy their products? Why should I give even one red cent of my money? That's right, I shouldn't and you shouldn't either. The only way to teach these companies is to hurt them where it hurts the most, in their bank accounts. A year or two of reduced profits from less device sales should send a clear message to them that unless they start supporting older devices (for at least three years) we won't buy their new devices, simple as that. I myself voted with my wallet, I bought an iPhone. I'm guaranteed updates the same day that everyone else gets the updates. I'm guaranteed updates for at least four years. McStagger WHY DOES NETFLIX CARE IF THE PHONE IS ROOTED?!?!?!?! mxwp Netflix does not care, but the content creators that make the stuff you see on Netflix do care. They care because they are idiots who think it is easier to pirate from rooted phones. bekifft Again, Google becomes more and more restrictive. I switched from iPhone because the screens were too small, and Google was far less restrictive. Both of those issues are now resolved, and Google's upped the price of their device to match Apple. May as well switch back to iPhone, Google seems to support it just as much as Android anyway. Luxferro Except it's not just rooted users! Any device with an unlocked bootloader. hp-fourtwenty Your comment sucks for misinforming users about what safetynet is....has NOTHING to do with unlocked bootloaders. Luxferro Sure it does. My Nexus 6P only has an unlocked bootloader, and Netflix disappeared from the play store after the last update. And I'm not the only one, so I suggest you do some reading. TechGuy22 more reason for me to pirate hey, have at it Matías Duarte I hope Netflix does the same with Jailbroken iOS devices. Why they do this btw? To prevent people recording their movies? You can do that with Windows.. Knowledgeborn Allah In all honesty, that'll probably never happen. Jailbreaking iOS opens the doors to a lot of customization on an iPhone, but the security issues are often minimal (with the exception being not having the latest software version). Jailbreaking is pretty much filtered through the Cydia platform. You don't have access to the entire system with a jailbreak. Rooting is completely different, because you can completely reshape the core OS. fbl Note : I don't work for Netflix so I can't comment for them. Possible causes : - the right holders might be pushing for this. I work on roughly the same product area and we don't implement DRM because we like them, we implement them because we contractually have to. -Netflix is tired of getting low notes because of crashes coming by shitty hacks in custom roms. Zach Mauch Anyone know how chromebooks will be affected by this? Will dev mode being enabled cause you to fail SafetyNet Checks? That is currently the only way to install apks on Chromebooks. Branko But Android AOSP!11 -Google 2011 How the times how changed. Wayne Randall ALT arguement, because I don't have time to read every comment... This doesn't limit me and my rooted N6P at all, this move limits how much money they (the devs and Google) are going to make. I can't buy it (the app or coins, or special characters, or bonus content, w/e) if I can't see it. Plain and simple. The important apps will still be there. No app is worth unroot. Block Project Fi from root though... weeeellll. I guess I'd unroot for that. mxwp yeah, only Netflix, banks, and big names will use these blocks. i am guessing most devs want as much exposure as possible. PVL_93_RU Google is actively trying to kill the modding community. Not the Custom ROM makers, but people who root and install Xposed. All because they compromise the security for Android Pay I fear the day root and Xposed apps start disappearing from the Play Store trparky If it comes to security vs being open, security will always win (or at least should always win). Eric Koop I had my Shaw Gateway app update yesterday and they changed it so it doesn't work if rooted. So I had to uninstall and find an APK online of an older version. Now it's just a matter of time before I forget and re-install the update. What a pain... disqus_em5YfkbWdk Well this would certainly get me to cancel Netflix. My personal Plex server is far better than Netflix could ever be anyway. Vivek Rameses Becoming apple more and more every day. Disgusting. Knowledgeborn Allah Android is starting to look more and more like iOS with each update... ¯_(ツ)_/¯ trparky Open platforms rarely stay open once the Benjamins start rolling in. hp-fourtwenty Go ahead and block me...I'll just pirate your app. Play nice and so will I. Start poking me and I'll poke back by never giving you another penny. App devs can't beat XDA devs. It's not going to happen. My unlocked, rooted, rommed and modded device still passes safety net. The day that stops, so does the flow of money leaving my hands on the play store. Luxferro Lay off the sodas.... UniBroW Question, can those of you without access to Netflix on Google play, can it be installed from the Amazon App Store? Stanley C. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/dd381b7e8a39df74c4725712a0db906098c965e9ee4194b6e01e020fd69ee566.png Thats how magisk is made... Magic! Marti Abernathey Yawn. I've got a rooted device and just installed Netflix... because? Magisk. As soon as they made this choice I cancelled. Not because I can't get around it, but because they make me do that. mrjayviper even on a non-rooted LOS mis 5s+, I cannot install Netflix. unlocking the bootloader already tripped safety. And I don't want to root. The features available in non-rooted LOS is enough for me. Teh BuG No. Bueno. TedPhillips Sigh. What's the over-under on this becoming pervasive in the play store... MicroG / Fdroid I'm coming soon. World needs a solid single alternative gcm replacement to catch on. TedPhillips As far as the potential for support overhead, being rooted is generally less than the pain coming from the Xposed/magisk crowd. You need to be actively interfering with an app via root vs code being injected into low levels of the framework that everything uses. TedPhillips I think the best outcome could be that Google opens up their process for little guys to certify there own rom builds, ala let's encrypt lowering friction on getting ssl setup. AOSP should not be a functionally useless base implementation for I'm roms, but something you can use in​ practice. TedPhillips Hey guys, don't worry. Google says Android is for everyone. https://www.android.com/everyone/ That includes AOSP developers too, right? That website seems to tread the line pretty carefully, ala 'no one is forcing you use Google play' but Hiroshi's quote seems like it comes with a grain of salt since he owns Play. I'd love to see AP interview him about this. qkjDlav As an app developer for a large app used globally, the two biggest time wasters in a developer's life are a) debugging device specific issues (HTC, Samsung, etc) and b) crash logs with Xposed in the stack trace. Developers are tired of having to sit around with device farms at their desks just to make sure new features and changes work with each quirky variant of Android that manufacturers want to deploy, and custom roms do make it worse. Enthusiasts are welcome to customize their own versions of Android and sideload apps, but we don't want to see crashlogs in the Developer Console from rooted/custom ROM users. And companies probably don't want to keep paying us to debug issues that only a small minority of users will see. Lê Nguyên Chương Most stupid thing I've ever heard in my life.

To date, the company has encouraged developers to adhere to best practices guidelines in areas of both app design and performance, and they reward developers mostly with increased visibility on Google Play. That is, you won’t see Google recommending a note taking app for, say, best productivity apps if the app looks like it was made in 2008. Developers are also naturally inclined to take up these best practices for the sake of being on the good side of editorialists everywhere, because we can tell you we definitely do pass on requests to promote ugly or buggy apps if they don’t have some niche killer feature. If your app looks like it came from this era and runs like crap, prepare to be irrelevant. But Google apparently wants to go even further by implementing a penalty system for apps that are performing poorly. The system would check the percentage of users who experienced a poorly performing app, including things like app crashes, lengthy and excessive device wakeups, apps that drain battery, or apps that freeze up or render at slow framerates. If your app ranks in the bottom 25% of any of these categories, Google will not only alert you and offer tips to improve it, but may also dock you huge points in Google Play’s search engine ranking (which could make all the difference between your app being one of the top 3 results to not even showing up on the first page). We’re not sure how, exactly, the system will work when it comes to tangible penalties and whether there’s any grey area for developers to work around, but any developer serious about their work should consider this a warning shot to ensure their apps are performing as well as they can just to dodge having to deal with it in the first place. It’ll help yourself, Google, and — most importantly — your users. local_offer    Google   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (9) stars Further Reading Google Photo Books are arriving on mobile devices Google and Mobvoi bring Assistant to the Tichome Mini Here are the 2017 Google Play Award winners Android Pay hits 5 more countries Google Assistant gets an app directory stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertNexus 6P and 5X getting an Android O upgrade error closeGetting the Nexus 6P & 5X: Android O Upgrade Error?

These Photo Books can be made from your mobile device or through the web browser on your computer. Google said Photo Books would be coming to the Photos mobile app in the “coming weeks”, but it seems some folks are already seeing the option in the app. Once you’re ready to create a Photo Book for yourself or a loved one, Google will use its machine learning techniques to automatically suggest photo books for you to buy. If you’re interested in picking up one for yourself, you can either check the Photos app on your mobile device or hit the button below to snag one. Pricing starts at $9.99 for the softcover book with 20 pages, while the hardcover book is priced at $19.99. If you want to expand past the 20-page limit, you can do so for $0.35 per page in the softcover book or $0.65 in the hardcover book.

"Following" : "Follow"}} May 22, 2017 12:17pm   Comments Share: Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) expounded on its model to productize and monetize artificial intelligence and machine learning at last week’s Google I/O Conference ━ and effectively won over Deutsche Bank analyst Lloyd Walmsley. “Given Google's long standing expertise here from core search, we see the company poised to innovate more rapidly on consumer product[s] with a stronger relative competitive position,” Walmsley wrote in a Monday note. Mobile Boosts He was particularly impressed by the company’s accelerated mobile pages ad product, which eliminates the need for web-hosting services by enabling content hosting on its search results page. The AMP model promotes video and carousel ads with lower launch times and accommodates Moat analytics. “Though only a limited percentage of Google ads thus far, AMP has shown compelling early results since its 2015 launch (relative to their non-AMP counterparts),” Walmsley wrote. Using the piloted model, 90 percent of publishers reported improved click-through rates, 70 percent increased viewability and 70 percent heightened effective cost per mille. Weighing these factors, Walmsley expects Google’s product to attract and retain publishers, including many of which pulled out in the height of the recent YouTube ad controversy. Virtual Reality The analyst was less convinced by progress on Google’s virtual reality platform, Daydream, which was unveiled at the 2016 conference. So far, the technology works on eight smartphone models and is enhanced by a standalone headset co-developed with QUALCOMM, Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM), but it’s not necessarily enough. “While the infrastructure appears promising, a relative dearth of VR content strikes us as a limiting factor near-term,” Walmsley wrote. “Google noted a need to offer free VR content trials to bolster consumer willingness to buy (few VR content providers offer such due to the content’s high expense), an introduction that we believe could unlock seemingly pent-up demand [...] and yield a compelling game to catalyze engagement and spur further demand.” Walmsley predicted a virtual reality market three times the size of that for two-dimensional apps, with a 32-percent spending increase per active user. However, he will not commit to bullishness before assessing content progress. Considering the company’s position to dominate the AI product field, Walmsley maintains a Buy on the stock with a $1,250 price target. At the time of publication, GOOG was trading around $939.50, while GOOGL was at $962.41.

Transparent Systems By Mike Alsup | May 22, 2017 CHANNEL: Information Management The future of ECM is coming, and it's going to be hard for most vendors to keep up PHOTO: Riccardo Annandale The future of enterprise content management (ECM) is coming, and it is going to be hard for many vendors to keep up. My friend John Mancini, Chief Evangelist of AIIM, recently described his vision of ECM’s future.  Inspired in part by the rash of acquisitions and consolidation in the market in 2016, Mancini foresees ECM moving into a “System of Understanding.” His perspective on the past and future of ECM (as seen in the table below) put into focus several issues I’ve been grappling with and resulted in this question: “What if the future is more like the past?” ECM past, present and future according to John ManciniPHOTO: John Mancini/AIIM A Vision of ECM's Future In my version of this chart, ECM would move not to Systems of Understanding, but to Transparent Systems.  (Editor's Note: Mancini's point of view changed as well. More on this below) These Transparent Systems will include the following elements: Technology Drivers Everyone has devices.  Business continues whenever, wherever. Technology isn’t a driver, it is an enabler and an anchor.   The cost of migrating legacy ECM technology implementations is what keeps organizations from moving to new ECM solutions.  The technology drivers Mancini sees as shaping the future — Hadoop, noSQL, analytics, cognitive computing, business intelligence — will have no meaning in the future. Almost all technology will be in the cloud, and subject matter expertise and user and administrative governance will act as the foundation of the ECM industry.   Problem  The tidal wave of information is accelerating. Companies enlist multiple ECM repositories to handle this, creating further problems rather than solutions. Nothing can be found, managed or governed.   In the future, organizations will store their content mainly in Amazon Web Services (AWS), Office 365/Azure or in Google. Microsoft and Google are competing to create unified object environments (Document, Voice, Email, Viewer, etc.) in Google Drive and in Office 365/Azure.   All other solutions will be too expensive, too cumbersome, not coordinated or integrated enough, or not compliant with rules like GDPR or data sovereignty. Issues related to cross-repository authentication, privacy, security and identity management will only get more complicated.   Business solutions found in platforms like Salesforce, SAP, Oracle, Workday, etc. will negotiate separate truces with these content platforms.   I once read that Microsoft has more servers in each of its 32 global data centers than SAP has on the earth. If SAP, which purportedly manages over half of the gross domestic product of the earth in its enterprise resource planning systems, can't compete at scale, how can OpenText or MicroFocus or Box?   The question will become “Why don’t you move everything or leave everything in Office 365 or Google or AWS?”   I predict the concept of organizations taking content out of Office 365, especially email, in order to govern it will cease to be a useful concept in 2017. Leave the repository driving to us.   Focus  Simplicity and consistency will be the two goals here. Once all information is consistently and transparently tagged and managed, extracting insights and relationships will be so much easier.   Information Managed  Paper is convenient to read and is easy and lightweight to carry, but it has no place in the future.  Wet signatures will give way to digital signatures. Information management will be a transparent, policy-driven background activity.   Information is a subset of data. Systems will consistently apply tags across all object types. No one will ever consider archiving email to manage it again.  Nothing on paper will be a record, unless viewed as an antiquity.   People  Distinctions like information professional or knowledge worker carry no more meaning than water-consuming humans or electricity-consuming humans.   These meaningless distinctions will be put aside in favor of people — just people. We are all information consuming and producing humans.   Process Focus Governance and IT as processes will (mostly) disappear from view for users.  Processes are functional, as in Finance or HR or Engineering. Tools support processes, and governance is a transparent background element of these tools. Subject matter expertise in Finance or HR or Engineering includes information management administration and configuration.   IT Role  IT's role (as it currently stands) will dwindle to almost non-existent. IT in the new age is akin to plumbing for water or electricians for electricity: it might be complex on the backend, but organizations don't want to think about it.  Plug in and it works, except most of the work is done by cloud-based services and it is all wireless and William Gibson-ish. In the future, IT will handle administrative configuration and monitoring, not technology integration.   Usability   Usability applies to the choice of apps (manly productivity) employees work with — and if it isn't usable, they will not work with it.  Today's concept of usability focuses on the absence of choice. In the future, it will be about choice. Governance will move to a platform function, unrelated to usability, rather than an app function.   Governance  Legal, HR and Business Departments will collectively decide what content needs to be governed from a privacy, access and retention perspective and will transparently enforce these rules at a content/tag level. Containers and templates will automatically (and transparently) apply governance policy.  Buyers There will be fewer solutions and the solutions that still exist will be akin to applications on iPhone or Salesforce.com — applications residing on a platform. ECM or repository platform solutions face almost certain obliteration. Microsoft, AWS and Google are the competitive platforms.   Transparent Systems Are Already Here With all of this in mind, here is my revised version of Mancini's chart:   So what do I mean when I say "Transparent Systems"? We can find examples of transparent systems that have existed for a few years now. Amazon’s One Click ordering is one example and another is how products you view on websites result in those ads that stalk you across the web.   Transparent systems aggregate a multi-faceted understanding of who you are and what you are doing, in order to cater to you and to your organization’s requirements and governance policies.   Microsoft's introduction of the Security and Compliance Center in the E5 tenant of Office 365 is the manifestation of its version of a transparent systems governance vision.  Based on my discussions with Fortune 20 companies, this approach will cause a large number of them to (at minimum) question why they should classify, archive or manage content retention outside of Office 365. How can ECM vendors, whose business models depend on convincing large organizations to archive content outside of Office 365, contemplate survival in this world?   While the solution may not be perfect today, the vision is unstoppable. Joe Shepley did a terrific job describing the industry's reaction to and dilemmas surrounding Office 365's growing capabilities and cloud governance vision in his recent article, “Is Office 365 Going to Eat Your Lunch?”  My follow up article will focus on how other vendors and partners can survive and prosper in this new world.    Author's Note: I shared this article pre-publication with Mancini.

The search engine has revolutionised the way we discover things, and a wealth of information is just a few clicks away. But there's one feature that can tell us a lot about what people are thinking.

You've probably noticed that when you start typing something into Google, suggestions can come up before you've finished typing. This is called Google Suggest, and it gathers predictions from common phrases other people have searched for. With that in mind, we decided to do a bit of an experiment to see what people want to know about Leicester. And we've gone even further by answering their questions. Why does Leicester... Why does Leicester have a statue of liberty? The Liberty Statue stood on top of the Liberty Shoe Factory in Walnut Street for 80 years – but when the factory was demolished, it was put into storage. In 2008 it was rehomed to a roundabout near Bede Island. Why does Leicester smell? Rude! But in all seriousness, muck spreading around the county can often cause a bit of a whiff around Leicester. A small price to pay for having all that gorgeous countryside. Why does Leicester have a fox? This one is probably in reference to Leicester City FC, who are also known as the Foxes due to the club's emblem. The design was inspired by the history of fox hunting in Leicestershire. Where does Leicester... Where does Leicester water come from? The water in Leicester taps is supplied by Severn Trent. They have reservoirs in multiple locations including Derbyshire and Warwickshire. Where does Leicester University rank? The most recent University League Table puts Leicester University in 29th place; and De Montfort at 82nd. Where does Leicester City play? Leicester City FC play at King Power Stadium, on Filbert Way. How is Leicester... How is Leicester pronounced? This one was so common that Google filled in the sentence for us. For the ongoing hilarity of Americans being unable to pronounce Leicester, their best bet would be to go with the classic 'less-tah' pronunciation. How is Leicester City doing? It was very unlikely that Leicester City would be champions for a second year in a row, and this year they finished 12th in the Premier League. How is Leicester to live? Leicester was recently ranked 17th on a list of best cities to raise a family in the UK. So not the best – but we did manage to beat Birmingham and London. How is Leicester City in the Champions League? Leicester's Champions League dream was crushed after a quarter-final draw against Atlético (2-1 on aggregate) – but they had a great run, and were the last UK team in the competition. Does Leicester... Does Leicester have an airport? Our nearest airport is East Midlands Airport, which is located between Derby, Nottingham and Leicester. Does Leicester City play today? Seeing as the Premier League just finished, no. Leicester City played their final match of the season against Bournemouth yesterday, drawing 1-1. Does Leicester Square have a lift? Wrong city mate. Does Leicester have Uber? Yes – the popular taxi service is available in Leicester. Flat fares are also available to airports. Leicester is...

Segment fees paid by airlines, age of the technology and how long it takes to get anything new done are all popular reasons for GDS bashing. However, at an airline event last week, the bashing was reserved for Google Flight Search, which is ringing alarm bells for some in the travel industry for the strength it is gathering. It’s a subject close to the heart of CarTrawler’s technology chief Bobby Healy who first laid out his concerns here about a year ago. In short, Healy feels GFS is “very bad” for the airline industry (and travel in general), airline.com and future distribution. He sees the roll out of the service enables Google to extend its reach to the top of the trip planning funnel – i.e where consumers go first to start planning a trip. And, Healy thinks airlines need to evaluate GFS in a different way to other potential threats because of Google’s power and the data it has on consumers and their purchase intent. He says that “in good times” a GDS makes about $3 per booking, an airline makes about $21 but currently, according to Healy, Google is making $16 per online airline booking. “It’s growing every year, widening and deepening as they take more of the travel funnel.” It’s not about cost Healy was speaking at the CAPA conference in Dublin last week but said it’s actually not about cost but about “the loss of control.” He likens Google to a “blender” because it attracts more and more users with its products and ecosystem and gathers more information, data and insight on them. “They have more access to you customers then you’ll ever have, more insight into your customers, more data. It knows your customers location, it knows absolutely everything about your customer. “It has an engineering capability like nothing we’ve ever seen and produce products quicker than anyone else. “Airlines willingly give Google their pricing data and inventory in real time sub 10 response times. That key item is the problem here as you have created the perfect storm for intermediation of your own customer base.” What to do? Airlines can push back GFS on this by only giving up their data on their own terms. This is something Healy believes both American Airlines and Ryanair are doing. And, provide the sort of value Google is providing, via better mobile products, for example. Or, wait for the regulators to catch up. Those solutions seem weak as pointed out by CNN journalist Richard Quest who was moderating the CAPA session and says it’s like “trying to hold back the tide.” He questions whether it’s possible for the airline to be in control and own the customer with the number of distribution channels out there and ongoing disruption. But, ultimately control lies with the customer as Travelport global head of product and marketing Ian Heywood stresses. “That’s where it should reside but it’s about what is put in front of the customer. Is the airline going to be able to do that or is someone else going to do it for them?” Heywood says a more collaborative approach is the way forward so that airlines can improve how products and services are shown to consumers and it is no longer all about price. He adds that airlines need to take steps along an API path to move forward generally. “Everyone talks about disruption, that’s the reason no one has moved anywhere. Airlines have been waiting for a big disruption rather than working with the industry to plan evolution.” Steps to IATA NDC Heywood says airlines need to start using a combination of existing ATPCo technology and API to ensure their content is being distributed via various channels. “Once you have those steps in progress then arilines can see how they can get more content into the API path.” He stresses that it’s going to take a lot of time and will require investment in both API technology and a merchandising platform. “ATPCO works well and is really efficient so we’ve got to make sure new technology and processes are as effective and as efficient.” Heywood adds that carriers will also need to “reengineer the human process” to get buy in from everyone. The last word So, taking into consideration slim margins, 40 years of technology and the complex fare structure – can it be done? Healy says airlines really need to focus on what the problem is. SAP general manager and global head of travel & transportation Paul Pessutti adds that the airline industry needs to invest in areas such as data science. For Heywood, although the industry is only a “minute way along the path” – the technology is there and the standard is there so it’s just about bringing it all together.

Required fields are marked * Comment Notify me of followup comments via e-mail Name * Email * Website Ted There’s only one reason why I start with Google Flights anytime I search for a flight — it doesn’t suck. (1) it doesn’t take forever to give me results; (2) it doesn’t bias the result based on whatever airline is giving them more money (3) the results isn’t cluttered with pop-ups reading “978 other people are buying this ticket” or “add insurance to this trip” (4) they give me the information I want (type of aircraft, meal or no meal, seat pitch or, if in business, lie flat or slanted seats, entertainment or no entertainment, Wi-Fi or no Wi-Fi, etc.), (5) they compare buying separate tickets on roundtrips, (6) their recommendations are usually very good and (7) they allow me to compare flights from different airlines. As a consumer, it’s very clear that the enemy in airline distribution are the airline themselves, whose sites totally suck. For example, on the site from the world’s largest airline, American Airlines, I can’t even tell what meals are included in my $2,000 business class ticket, what type of seat I will be sitting in, or if there will be any seatback entertainment. Why would I ever want to start my purchase there? You should ask consumers before writing articles! Reply 6 days ago   N Funny that Mr. Healy balks at the $16 GFS makes per booking, then he goes on to talk about how Google has more access to customers and engineering capability no one else has. Perhaps the $16 is commensurate for the value added by the capabilities/data/funnel of Google that airlines don’t have (and will probably never have). However, I do agree that airlines may be working themselves into a corner by embracing Google. I would also like to know where the $16 number comes from. I suspect he is confusing revenue and profit. Reply 6 days ago   Bobby Healy Hi N, not confusing rev from profit…the number on GOOG is indeed rev, because it’s impossible to get to EBITDA based on the numbers they publicly disclose. That number is actually provided by a recent SKIFT article. I think it’s fair to compare GOOGs rev alongside other numbers as an indicator of how rich the segment is for them and how much they are ultimately taking out of the total wallet. Ultimately, ALL of these costs will be paid by the consumer – so the more GOOG take, either the airlines have to subsidise that in some way, or the Hotel and other ancillary aggregators do. Or…(and this is what the EU believes), the Consumer will end up paying. The more expensive advertising becomes, the more the prices will have to rise, or margins decline. And there will only be ONE winner in that equation. The monopoly that controls ALL the traffic. Reply 5 days ago   Josh Gunn So Lufthansa estimates that selling a fare through the GDS amounts to €16 and Google is apparently earning $16 (€14.35 as of May ’17) for a flight booked through GFS. Which is the better user experience for the person actually paying for the ticket? Undeniably GFS. Admittedly not a complete apples to apples comparison as both sets of figures are assumptive, but when cost is more or less equal, user experience wins. I agree that a travel industry dominated by Google and Amazon isn’t a future many people, including myself, want but it’s basic human nature to want 1. Choice 2. Value and 3. Simplicity. These things will not change. If the industry ignores that and keeps treating people like they shouldn’t be trying to compare costs and offerings in a quick and simple way then they’ll have nobody to blame but themselves. They should redouble their efforts to build loyal brand followers (looking at you United, BA) while accepting that for many, we just want the cheapest flight with the least amount of hassle involved in booking it. Ps. An airline’s brand investment should inform the user’s decision ahead of time, not dictate it at the point of sale. Reply 4 days ago   Ian R Clayton Well GDS is pretty outdated and it time for modern technology and up to date systems to replace it. I am not happy that is Google. It is being very disruptive to travel companies now, from hotels to activities and all the steps from planning to purchase. Its power is unrelenting and it looks poised to close down all the small companies who provide services to travels and hotels. We do not want a single company dominating the entire landscape! Reply 7 days ago   Henry Harteveldt ATPCO may “work” well but it is as relevant as a DC-6 in today’s airline world. Airlines are, as the should be, intent on pursuing dynamic pricing, which means less reliance on pre-filed fares and, in turn, ATPCO. Reply 7 days ago   Ian Tunnacliffe Henry, you are right but with very few exceptions airlines are literally years away from being able to do dynamic pricing. And this whole mantra about GDSs being outdated is something I have been hearing for more than 20 years. Remember the GDSs rôle is providing data to intermediaries who then interpret it for consumers. These intermediaries may be human travel agents or additional technology layers. The end consumer should never see a raw GDS display. With that in mind, where are the deficiencies in GDS technology? I can think of some but they are as much to do with airlines’ inability to provide their offers in a modern form as they are about the GDSs inability to consume them. Lest anyone be unclear, I do think that the GDSs have been under responsive to airlines’ wishes to update their proposition and I certainly think that there was a period from roughly 1995 to 2005 when they were guilty of some horrific price gouging. All that said, any airline that wants to switch to an API connection to the GDSs is able to do it today, so why have so few outside the LCC space chosen to do so? Reply 17 hrs ago   Paul Byrne Henry, Agree that the desire for airline to retake control, make the offer and know their customer in order to better serve them is the way forward. All of this in real time, in addition. Cost saving/reduced filing/fewer ADMs are all desirable outcomes also.

We have covered some of the major announcements to give you an indication of where the company is headed. Artificial Intelligence (AI) Steals the Limelight With AI and machine learning dominating the announcements, it appears that Google is banking on these for much of its future growth. Google Assistant was first announced at I/O 2016 and today it has a slew of new features. It is now equipped with computer-vision technology called Google Lens that can analyze anything the phone’s camera is seeing and reveal relevant information. Google is expanding Assistant to iOS, offering almost the same functions as on Android.  The company will also be launching assistant in new languages and an Assistant developer kit for third parties. With Google Home, Google became the second entrant in the Home Assistant space after Amazon AMZN. Amazon leads the space with its Echo device, but Google still has enough scope. The Google Assistant powered Home can personalize user’s experience probably more completely (when linked to user’s Google profile) and also help search for pretty much everything under the sun. In the coming months, Google Home will be able to make hands-free calls to any phone in the U.S. and Canada. This way it will have an edge over Amazon Echo that can make calls to Echo users only. The device will feature a new skill called “proactive assistance”, with which it will notify users of upcoming traffic, meetings, and other related stuff based on their schedule. In addition Home will now connect to a user’s phone or a Chromecast streaming device to reveal the required information. It will control Hulu, SoundCloud, HBO Now, Deezer, and more. Users will now have access to Home’s Bluetooth radio. With the kind of advantages Google is pushing to Home, it appears that it has already cracked the code on how to answer all those Amazon Echo offers. We believe Alphabet’s continuous focus on innovation and its technological prowess are contributing significantly toward driving up its shares. The stock has rallied 20.5% compared with the Zacks Internet-Services industry’s gain of 16.8% on a year-to-date basis. View photos The company announced that the upcoming virtual reality (VR) headsets from its partners including Lenovo and HTC will be standalone and therefore will not need a smartphone. Google has built a reference design in partnership with Qualcomm. There were speculations that Google will merge Tango with Daydream.  The company stated that its Tango powered “WorldSense” technology will track user’s location in the virtual space. This could give Google competitive advantage over Facebook FB and Microsoft MSFT who are also working on similar technologies. Google’s Photos app now has a host of new features. The app’s new AI-based feature called Suggested Sharing can recommend users to share a photo with people who are part of it. The Shared Library feature allows users to effortlessly add images to a central collection. Google has also added the option of digital photo book creation. Users can get softcopies mailed for $9.99 while the hardcopy costs $19.99. Google stated that in the future, the app will remove unwanted items from photos. Read More Google is adding the AI based Smart Reply feature to Gmail. It will suggest responses (three) to mails received based on typing style and habit. As it is based on machine learning, it gets better with usage. Google for Jobs will now use Google’s search technology and machine learning to collect, categorize and sort job postings from the web. Alphabet Inc. Net Income (TTM) View photos Alphabet Inc. Net Income (TTM) | Alphabet Inc. Quote A More Developer Focused I/O 2017 This year’s I/O has seen Google improving on developer centrism. Instead of big-bang product announcements to impress customers and the press, Google has opted to be more informative for developers and help them better understand its technological improvements. Google released the first beta version of Android O. Users can download it on a compatible smartphone. Expected updates to Google’s latest Android version are picture-in-picture video, new emoji, security enhancements, auto-fill logins and passwords, more AI capabilities and more battery life. Google is set to roll out a new version of Android called Android Go especially designed to be compatible with smartphones with 1GB of memory or less. The operating system will feature YouTube Go to allow users save videos and watch or share them offline. This will particularly enable developers and hardware manufacturers develop low-priced phones without compromising on the quality of user experience. On the Hardware Front The company introduced the second generation of its tensor processor units (TPUs) for its prospering cloud service business. TPU chips facilitate fast and efficient building of AI on Google’s platform. CEO Sundar Pichai stated that TPU and the TensorFlow platforms are now optimized to work together, which indicates that Google’s cloud computing platform is being converted to Android for AI. This could easily give Google an edge over competitors. Android Crosses 2 Billion Monthly Active Users Google has taken the mobile market transition in its stride. Pichai stated that the figure of monthly active Android Devices has surpassed 2 billion. This includes any device that runs on Android including smartphones, tablets, Android TVs, and Android Wear devices. To Conclude Google’s speed and scale of technological improvements clearly indicate that it refuses to rest on its past laurels and continues to adapt to changing market trends. Google’s innovations outside the core search business include healthcare, voice-controlled platforms, self-driving cars, cloud computing and drones, all being driven significantly by machine learning. We believe Google is just starting to scratch the surface of what it could do with AI. Currently, Alphabet sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Apple is shoring up Siri for its next generation of intelligent devices Posted May 16, 2017 by John Mannes (@JohnMannes) 0 SHARES Next Story Apple could release MacBook updates soon Advertisement Apple once led the pack with its intelligent assistant Siri, but in just a few years, Amazon, Microsoft and Google have chipped away at its lead. Siri is a critical component of Apple’s vision for the future, so integral that it was willing to spend $200 million to acquire Lattice Data over the weekend. The startup was working to transform the way businesses deal with paragraphs of text and other information that lives outside neatly structured databases. These engineers are uniquely prepared to assist Apple with building a next-generation internal knowledge graph to power Siri and its next generation of intelligent products and services. Broadly speaking, the Lattice Data deal was an acquihire. Apple paid roughly $10 million for each of Lattice’s 20 engineers. This is generally considered to be fair market value. Google paid about $500 million for DeepMind back in 2014. At that time, the startup had roughly 75 employees, of which a portion were machine learning developers. Give or take a few million, the math pretty much works out. But beneath the surface, the deal signals that Apple is willing to spend significant capital shoring up the backbone of Siri. Apple and its peers grapple with the challenge of teaching conversational assistants basic knowledge about the world. Apple relies on a number of partnerships, including a major one with Yahoo, to provide Siri with the facts it needs to answer questions. It competes with Google, a company that possesses what is largely considered to be the crème de la crème of knowledge graphs. Apple surely has an interest in improving the size and quality of its knowledge graph while unshackling itself from partners. Lattice’s experienced engineers are particularly important to Apple as it designs future products for an AI-first world. Companies like Microsoft, Facebook and Google have already declared their intentions to build up infrastructure to support the implementation of machine learning in as many products and services as possible. Apple brought on Rus Salakhutdinov in October 2017 to lead research efforts at the company, and it has acquired startups like Turi and RealFace, but it still has a lot of work to do if it intends to remain competitive in AI in the long run. “Google is applying machine and deep-learning to about 2,500 different use cases internally now. Apple should be doing the same,” asserted Chris Nicholson, CEO of Skymind, the creators of the DL4J deep learning library. Latest Crunch Report Ford Gets A New CEO | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes At Apple, the Lattice Data team could start by helping Apple get its knowledge graph up to speed. This infrastructure is integral to Apple’s plan to embed Siri into each of its products. It’s an ideal place to start because it both improves existing offerings like Siri search on Apple TV and lays the groundwork for future products like its rumored Amazon Echo competitor. Siri for Apple TV allows for complex multi-part natural language searches. A knowledge graph is a representation of known information about the world. Information within a knowledge graph can either come from structured data from a database or unstructured data scraped from a document or the internet. When you use Siri to search iTunes, the results have to come from somewhere. A knowledge graph makes it possible to draw complex relationships between entries. Today, Siri on Apple TV allows for complex natural language search like “Find TV shows for kids” followed up by “Only comedies.” A surprising amount of information is required to return that request and some of it might be buried in the summaries of the shows or scattered on the internet. “Machine learning algorithms produce better results the more data you expose them to,” explained Nicholson. “So if you can find a way to extract value from unstructured data, you’re tapping the largest data set in the world, and the expectation would be that it produce the best results.” Crunchbase Steve Jobs Bio Steve Jobs was the co-founder and CEO of [Apple](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/apple) and formerly [Pixar](/company/pixar).

SRI spun off Siri, Inc., in 2007, and this company launched a personal assistant app in February 2010. … Location San Jose, CA Categories iOS, Consumer Electronics, Software, Virtualization Website https://www.siri.com Full profile for Siri Google’s knowledge graph returns basic information on popular topics so you don’t always have to click on a website to get what you’re looking for. The problem with extracting data from unstructured sources is that it’s difficult to verify the accuracy of the information being pulled. Dr. Dan Klein, chief scientist at Semantic Machines, a startup building its own conversational AI, explained to me that companies typically run shallow natural language models to pull dates and facts from text sources. Initially this process is probabilistic, meaning that what text is labeled as important data is a matter of confidence and likelihoods, but once that data is extracted, it’s effectively treated as a certainty. “You can do a better job of extracting unstructured data if you track confidence all the way through,” added Klein. This is the idea behind Stanford professor Christopher Ré‘s work on DeepDive that was ultimately commercialized as Lattice Data. Classical databases assume everything is correct, so any future queries might unwittingly return false information.  You can better account for this dangerous uncertainty by tracking how vetted information is. A unified rather than pipeline approach increases accuracy and makes it clear what is known, unknown and uncertain at any given time, Klein told me. Greater confidence in the information you’re extracting allows you to create larger, more connected, knowledge graphs that can accommodate more complex searches. This gives any machine intelligence-powered services that sit on top of the data an edge over competitors. Siri could be improved to answer a wider variety of questions — accounting for its own uncertainty to deliver a better customer experience.

How Google plans to tackle power consumption even more aggressively in Android Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 5:29pm PDTMay 18, 2017 15 Plus 1 on G+ 99 Share on Facebook 58 Share on Twitter Total Shares172 Android OS Development Google News Videos Yesterday at I/O Google had an interesting talk called Background Check and Other Insights into the Android Operating System Framework. It's a long name, but really it's about improving battery life in Android. It went on at great length as to how, exactly, they plan on doing that, and it's quite worth a watch. We have the video here, but if you don't have the half-hour to check it out, then you are welcome to read below. The central methodology Google is using to try to improve things is the idea of visibility. When something is running in the background and doing a ton of stuff like calling your location at quick intervals, it results in battery drain. So now Google wants to change how things happen in the background, by ensuring that free-running background services aren't sucking your battery dry. Background apps will be pushed out of memory when they leave the foreground, and requests for things like location or WiFi happening in the background will only occasionally see new information from Android. Applications that would otherwise receive broadcasts also might not wake up unless they are given an explicit call to do so in the broadcast, although there are some exceptions. Apps can still get around this by being foregrounded in some way, but now that will be something visible that the user is aware of. This focus on visibility for apps will also mean developers will have to make decisions about what is really better to the user. If doing an ongoing notification as a means of bypassing the stuff above would confuse a user, is that really the right thing for them to do in that case? Other tools can be used to schedule your tasks ahead of time or to wait for events like the job intent service that developers can use in both pre and post-O environments. Jobs and alarms also allow the OS to defer. So, if something happens that would trigger a bunch of other apps to wake up, like a new picture being taken, that can be passed to those apps one at a time after a delay. That way the user doesn't suddenly have a ton of performance issues and drain out of nowhere. Basically, Google wants to solve some of the problems with battery life by defining bad behaviors for developers, like persistent background services or accidental leaks to the background of typically foregrounded activities, and make it clear that things have to be done the right way going forward or their stuff won't work. But it's also giving them new tools and choices for how to best accomplish the things they need to do. The new features in the Play Console and in Android Studio should also help developers be aware of when they are making these mistakes so that they can be fixed. It's a matter of visibility for the developers as well as visibility for the users. To paraphrase Steve Balmer: Visibility, visibility, visibility. A significant user-facing change of this visibility mindset is a new battery menu in O, with a focus on actionable interaction. Instead of just seeing stuff like Screen and Google Play Services next to a number that they won't understand, now users will be given ways of interacting with that data if they don't like it, and can better see how they are using applications without needing to do a bunch of mental calculations. So, when a user has a problem with their expectations of battery performance and goes looking to see what might be causing it, they are more likely to find what caused it, understand what it means, and take action about it. All of these changes are is in pursuit of Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life. Right now the tools in software aren't all there, but these are steps that can take us in that direction.

Good feature to take from iOS Knowledgeborn Allah This does seem similar to what Apple implemented in iOS, but I'm curious about how this will impact RAM management. If it reduces the cache file too much, it'll just close the application completely, and you'll have to start over every time you want to use the app again. Apple somehow found a way around this problem, even in devices with less RAM, but I'm not too sure how Google will accomplish this. Even "doze" on my Pixel XL kills apps in the background all the time. This new thing sounds it could potentially make the problem worse. Justin Osborne Well I sure can tell a difference since upgrading, that's for sure. The new battery section makes me feel a lot better about how the battery is looking. But that's where it ends. Today, I got a full hour less out of my battery than normal. 2 hours vs 3-3.5 on the Pixel. That said, it's a beta, so I'm not complaining. It's definitely not the direction I want to go tho (nor are these new emoticons, sigh). marcusmarcus2 "Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life." I'm glad, but can we get a two pronged attack to address this. Yes, Google needs to keep improving the software side, but OEMs need to help out and quit making thinner phones. They are thin enough, give us more battery capacity. AbdulB1 actually they save quite a lot by putting small batteries in the phones instead of big ones. Krzysztof Jozwik I'm not sure you read OP's comment. Nothing was said about saving... AbdulB1 smaller capacity battery is much cheaper marcusmarcus2 My original comment was not about savings, cheapness, cost, etc. Jack Jennings You've said the same thing twice for no reason. Krzysztof Jozwik I wouldn't say "much" I'm no expert on the matter, but last I checked replacement batteries aren't that expensive, and I don't have the buying power of an oem AbdulB1 Most phones today dont have replacement batteries, they have unremovable ones. OEM or no OEM a 3000mAh battery will always be cheaper than 4000mAh one. marcusmarcus2 I can find batteries for my different Moto G phones that have "Non-User replaceable batteries" for nearly the same price as my LG phones that have user replaceable batteries online. Most likely the OEMs can get them for about the same as well so replaceable or not really does not matter. Either way, yes a 3000mAh battery will be cheaper than a 4000mAh one for OEMs, but probably not much at all, especially at the volume they would by at. I'm guessing they are choosing smaller batteries to make their phones thinner and not because it is slightly cheaper for them. Thinness is better to advertise to most consumers as most consumers are drawn to looks over functionality now a days. I still prefer function over looks for my devices. Krzysztof Jozwik And non replaceable will always be cheaper than replaceable. The point is, the batteries aren't the bulk of the cost. Geoff Johnson What the hell is your point? He never said anything about cost, he was just talking about stop making phones thinner for design and aesthetic reasons. james fuston The idea that smaller and thinner phones result in less battery life is a bit of a misnomer. For an example, I'd refer you to the iPhone SE. marcusmarcus2 I never said smaller and thinner. I just said thinner. They could make some of the phones the same height and width as the current one but make it a little thicker to give a thicker battery, and that would help with the battery life. james fuston Okay, but your general sentiment is still that battery life is tied directly to physical size which, again stating my example of the iPhone SE, isn't the case. The power draw of the components is far more important than the physical size of the phone. marcusmarcus2 My general sentiment is ONLY in regards to thickness of the phone. My sentiment is not to width or height, which also make up the size of the phone. The width and height is usually determined more by the screen where thickness is more often do to battery. A larger screen (component) will draw more power than a smaller screen, I agree with you there. But you seem to think the size of the battery does not make a difference, please correct me if I am wrong. Using your example of iPhone SE, if they would have made that a little thicker than it is now by making the battery larger, that would have made the battery life even longer than it already is. That is my point. james fuston > A larger screen (component) will draw more power than a smaller screen, I agree with you there. Let me give this one more shot. "your general sentiment is still that battery life is tied directly to physical size which, again stating my example of the iPhone SE, isn't the case" To break out the pieces, battery life is tied...to physical size...which, again...isn't the case. In other words, we do not agree. The iPhone SE is the exact same size as the iPhone 5S and it gets 30%+ better battery life purely through efficiency in components. To say high mAh results in long battery life is a misnomer that the G6 or V20 should be a clear reminder of. You also cannot equate physical size to battery capacity as energy density is not a universal measurement. marcusmarcus2 You are comparing different phones with different components. I agree with you that component efficiency has an effect on battery life. But... Let me give you one more shot. We will use your iPhone SE for this. If there were 2 versions of the SE. Both have the exact same components except one has a battery that is 1000 mAh larger than the other (thus making it slightly thicker), than the one with the larger battery would have more battery life, Thus the thicker one would have better battery life. That is what I am saying. I'm not comparing large phones to small phones. I'm saying if they had a larger battery in a phone with the exact same specs/components then the battery life would be better. That is all my point was. Do you not agree with that? EDIT: Yes, size of the battery may not increase with capacity due to density, but it usually will increase in size as it does increase in capacity, especially if it increases a lot. Geoff Johnson Again, you're talking about it being smaller. The iPhone SE gets good battery life because it has a 4" screen. The complaint is that phones are getting THINNER. Meaning that they still have 5.5-6" displays, but are thinner and translate to smaller batteries. james fuston Nope, not at all. The cell in the SE is about 50mAh bigger than the 5S (which is the exact same size). The 30%+ battery life improvement comes from more efficient components, not just their size. marcusmarcus2 Technically it is 2 dimensional train of thought. Also, if they increased it horizontally or vertically, then they would most likely have to increase the dimensions of the phone horizontally or vertically, thus changing the size of the screen or bezel. Increasing it thickness wise means they would not have to change the look of the of the front of the phone. Anywho, I'm only talking about thickness, not height, width, different components, different phones, not small phones or big phones. I'm talking just battery capacity, if all other components remain the same. Thickening the battery would add battery capacity without changing the over all look much at all. It could be any phone of your choosing. If adding a thicker/higher capacity battery to whatever 1 phone you want, that phone would have a longer battery life. Do you not agree with that logic? james fuston Thickness is commonly referred to as "depth" otherwise known as the Z-axis. That's one dimension. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8cba520372d511803190227fe949a5d698a79509804cb6ec7f8f2afbe25323c3.gif marcusmarcus2 you are right, that is 1 dimensional thinking. I read it wrong. And you are right I miss the joke as I do not see what is funny. I'm glad you know that thickness is depth, but when referring to phones, depth is commonly referred to as thickness. Anyways, You are the one that is applying 3 dimensional thinking when my general sentiment was only referring to 1 dimension, thus you pretty much accused me of referring it to all dimensions, when I was not. Now you are complaining I'm only applying it to 1 dimension. Which is it? https://68.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmbq2nuTrp1qcr8tuo1_500.gif In all seriousness though. I AM only referring to 1 dimension, thickness or depth (whichever you want to go by). Then they can fit a thicker battery in to increase its capacity without having to get a higher cost denser battery and without changing the over all look of the phone. Compare that to getting a battery that is larger in height and/or width, that phone would need to be designed with either a larger bezel (which would most likely make the phone look bad) or use a larger screen (which would most likely be less power efficient which would negate some of the extra battery capacity). james fuston > you are right I miss the joke as I do not see what is funny. Missing the joke and not seeing the joke as funny are two different things, but the joke wasn't really meant for you either way. > I'm glad you know that thickness is depth, but when referring to phones, depth is commonly referred to as thickness Yes, this is referred to as a "synonym" in the English language. > You are the one that is applying 3 dimensional thinking when my general sentiment was only referring to 1 dimension, thus you pretty much accused me of referring it to all dimensions I'm not sure you understand how to use "thus." To recap; you said the way to make battery life longer was to make phones thicker. I said you shouldn't conflate (that means mistakenly associate) thickness with battery life, as the physical size of a battery can also be increased with an adjustment in width or height of a phone. Not sure how you got me "[accusing you] of referring it to all dimensions" out of that. I can tell now that your argument originates from the fact that you don't like bezels and aren't crazy about large screens, but also want longer battery life. The reality here is that the majority of people disagree with you and would care significantly if their next phone was substantially thicker than their current phone, largely due to the fact that increased thickness makes curved-edged or "bezel less" phones significantly harder to hold. marcusmarcus2 >Yes, this is referred to as a "synonym" in the English language. Yes, we both agree on the fact it means the same. I just wasn't sure why you pointed out it is the same as depth when that seems to have been obvious to both of us. Maybe I did not use 'thus' correctly, but I'm sure you know what I meant and just don't want to address it. >To recap; you said the way to make battery life longer was to make phones thicker. I said you shouldn't conflate (that means mistakenly associate) thickness with battery life, as the physical size of a battery can also be increased with an adjustment in width or height of a phone. Not sure how you got me "[accusing you] of referring it to all dimensions" out of that. How do you not get you, you just repeated it? I was only referring to 1 dimension and you are trying to apply more dimensions to, which would change the over all look of the phone which would make people that like that phone not want that phone any more, whatever the phone was to begin with. Also, your recap is incorrect. I just said phones should be thicker for better battery life, meaning the thickness should come because of a thicker battery. Your response was address "smaller AND thinner phones" meaning you were applying other dimensions to the thickness which would make it a different phone with most likely different parts. >I can tell now that your argument originates from the fact that you don't like bezels and aren't crazy about large screens Half right and half wrong. I don't like bezels. I do like large screens though. I'm not referring to big phones or small phones. I'm refering to and phone compared to itself but thicker. You are the one comparing different size (width and height) phones. My point is you don't have to change the look of whatever phone you like if you just increase the thickness, whether that phone is large or small. >The reality here is that the majority of people disagree with you You sure about that? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/013a3bd18bb4ffc1eba1ece1d07e1fe9b6aeb2639380ca6c9fe00b40e043e452.png When a company releases 2 choices of the same phone with only the thickness/battery being different (same screen size, storage, RAM, processor, etc.) then we can see if people really do feel about thickness over battery life) Sk0ly You can't compare between OSs. There is a reason Android uses more battery, it features true multitasking and doesn't drastically limit background processes like iOS. Looks like Google is going a bit to the Apple approach going forward as devs can't be counted on to write decent code. james fuston Seeing as we're talking about physical dimensions and hardware specifications and they're effect on power draw, you absolutely can compare between operating systems. Processors aren't suddenly able to use more power than they're designed to use just because you've installed a different operating system. Jason B "Processors aren't suddenly able to use more power than they're designed to use just because you've installed a different operating system." Just to jump in: sure, they won't use more than their design power, but they can be used very inefficiently depending on OS. All modern mobile SoCs have hardware clock and power gating, but if software isn't allowing the SoC to idle properly or needs to use more CPU/GPU cycles to complete tasks versus other OS, yes, you will use more power as the clocks+voltage jump around instead of going into SoC's proper sleep mode for former or will hold onto higher clocks longer for latter. Apple makes both its hardware and software, so if you think that has no net effect, well ... Sk0ly Except the OS's operate in a completely different manner. Androids advantage being background functionality and iOS advantage being battery life. marcusmarcus2 What's this "We" stuff? You are talking about physical dimensionS and hardware specificationS. I'm talking about A physical dimension and the only hardware specification I'm talking about is the capacity of the battery resulting from it being thicker. You don't like @Sk0ly:disqus comparing different OS's when OS's have nothing to do with the point you are making? That's funny because you are doing the same thing to me, comparing different size (height and width) phones with different specs when that has nothing to do with the point I am making. marcusmarcus2 To be fair, @j_fuze:disqus was not comparing between OSs. He was comparing between different iOS devices. Specifically iPhone SE and iPhone 5S. You have to read a few of his comments to see what he was comparing. Either way, he missed my point by comparing different phones with different specs. My point was if ALL things being the same between 2 phones, except one had a thicker/larger capacity battery, that would give that thicker phone more battery life. I'm not sure why James is so hell bent on comparing different size phones with different specs/components. james fuston > James is so hell bent on comparing different size phones with different specs/components. lol, because I'm not interested in comparing different colors of the same phone? I didn't realize we were comparing battery life of hypothetical devices. marcusmarcus2 Colors? What are talking about now? Seriously, focus. >I didn't realize we were comparing battery life of hypothetical devices. I'm glad you started to finally read then and figured it out. Unfortunately, they will stay hypothetical until companies come out with devices with bigger batteries. james fuston Yes, colors. What other difference could there possibly be if the dimensions and specs of the phone are the same? You're 0/3 on understanding a point presented by someone else now. marcusmarcus2 >You're 0/3 on understanding a point presented by someone else now. haha. Lets address this part first because it is too funny. Not only can you not focus, you are delusional. You are the one who cannot get a point and you try to say I don't get a point. You are hilarious. I'm the OP of this thread of comments, you replied to me initially and you failed to understand the point. You have since replied numerous other times and have failed again and again to understand the point, each time bringing up different aspects of a phone that had nothing to do with my initial point. I get your points, but they have nothing to do with what my point is initially. Just because you can't understand that does not mean I don't get your point. >Yes, colors. What other difference could there possibly be if the dimensions and specs of the phone are the same Hmm. This is a tough one. Maybe battery capacity and additional thickness dues to extra battery capacity, you know, like I have said since the bigining and in every other comment since then. No other dimension and spec other than those, like I said each time. Talk about not understanding a point, you are the king of missing the point. https://media.giphy.com/media/14r9VMLSuQUzQs/giphy.gif Lets try to make this easy for you. Try to answer the following. I'll give you a little help by giving you the answers seeing as you have trouble catching the point of this original comment thread. Would a larger capacity battery give a phone more battery life compared to a smaller capacity battery, considering that is the only difference? Yes. Would increasing the thickness of a battery give it more capacity, considering that is the only difference? Yes. Would a thicker battery result in a thicker phone, considering that is the only difference? Yes. Are there other ways of increasing battery life? (This was not part of my original point, but since you keep adding it then I'll address it) Of course, like more optimized software or more efficient parts. Would including a larger capacity battery along with optimizing the software and more efficient parts give more battery life than optimized software and more efficient parts alone? Of course they would. Do more efficient parts have anything to do with your point you are trying to make? No What about color? Again, nothing to do with my point. What about box the phone comes in? No, but I thought I'd through that in there as a guess what James might try and distract with next. Do you get my point yet? My point is a larger capacity battery through making battery and the phone thicker would make any phone have more battery life. I really hope you get the point this time as you seem to be the only one who can't comprehend this. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/013a3bd18bb4ffc1eba1ece1d07e1fe9b6aeb2639380ca6c9fe00b40e043e452.png james fuston > Of course, like more optimized software or more efficient parts. Hey look! After another 5 paragraphs he comes around to the same conclusion as the "delusional" guy. I'm looking forward to reading the next essay, keep em coming. Oh and keep posting screenshots of the up/downvotes you've enabled, it's highly entertaining. marcusmarcus2 Not picking out only parts of my response and ignoring what you don't want to address. I have not come to the same conclusion as you. Like I said I got your point about more efficient parts. But like I said, that has nothing to do with the point I was making. I won't explain it again, I've done so enough and if you don't get it by now, then you are either a special kind of stupid, smart but to suborn to admit your wrong, or a troll who successfully trolled me. I'm done reading your lack of intelligent responses. I'll let Bobby finish talking to you because I am done. http://pa1.narvii.com/5800/e40bec66da3b149914b3323a0a2d5e07bc96bce2_hq.gif https://m.popkey.co/765dfc/Re7oQ.gif JD The SE wasn't thinner. Ryne Hager Give me a OnePlus with 5000mAh and I would be so happy. someone755 Give me a 4.7" phone like the og Moto X and I would be so happy. Neither of us are going to be happy, Ryne. Drakenoid OG Moto X updated for current year would be perfect for me. Vlad I never broke a single headphone since I first had a smartphone in 2011 until I got a 5" phone. Since then, I need to buy new ones if I use one daily for more than 2 weeks, simply because sitting or walking up on stairs will break the cable thanks to the length of the phone. Upsides: 5" phone with 4100 mAh battery => amazing. And it's also thin as heck. Downsides: breaks headphones, bends, need to root for decent software (Xiaomi). Gimme back my 4.5" 720p screen, Motorola. Kristian Ivanov I highly agree on the thin phones part. Bought a Huawei P10 2 days ago, for me, that thing is unusable without a case to make it a bit fatter. Karly Johnston If they fix idle battery drain that doesn't become an issue. marcusmarcus2 I'm not saying they should not fix battery drain. I'm saying if they fix battery drain AND add higher capacity battery (making phone a little thicker), they could increase battery life even more than just addressing one of them. So if fixing the battery drain adds another day and a thicker battery adds another day, you'd go from 1 day to 3 days instead of just 2 days from only fixing battery drain. Karly Johnston The battery life the current 625 phones are getting is where flagships need to be. That should be enough for anyone. marcusmarcus2 Everyone is not all the same. It may be enough for you. I'm saying, phones are beyond thin enough and could be thicker to increase battery life even more beyond what a 625 phone can do. Now, this is my opinion in regards to how I would like to use a phone. You are welcome to your own opinion. I'm not going to say what should be enough for anyone other than me. Karly Johnston The OEMs don't think that is what the vast majority of people need or want. Their target is a full day of battery life which is what most people are worried about. It isn't my opinion, it is the industry opinion of what the marketing priorities are. X-47B My phone has 4000 mAh battery, and it's 5.5-inch display. I easily get 2 days of battery even after heavy usage. Margaritas Ante Porcos Installed O on my 6p and battery still drains like a whore in a bukkake twelvesome. Google really can't do nothing at this point. Android is breaking to pieces. So many things needed to be fixed in O but instead Android's got even worse. That notification empty desert area of white grey nothingness kills me the most. Hate it really bad. The last Android I liked was 6th. catalysto Not sure what you're talking about. Battery life on my 6P with the new O is great. Maybe you have an aging battery? Margaritas Ante Porcos as long as your 6p works great, nothing else matters, right? Roy That's right. catalysto Just saying. My anecdotal evidence is as good as yours. And having poor battery life across multiple OS versions is a pretty strong indicator for a bad battery, don't ya think? In fact, I had the same problem with a previous 6P. iFeign Complain some more about your beta software Margaritas Ante Porcos It started with 7.1.2. Do you really need to be a btch when bad things happen to others? Roy For me everything goes smooth on my 6P on 7.1.2. so I need to complain that Android to good. The Wrath of Kahn If your 6P has shut down even once before reaching about 5% then you most likely have one of the defective batteries. I had to have mine replaced, but after that, it runs all day like a charm. ODP2 improved it, if anything. Margaritas Ante Porcos it was fine for a long time until I updated to 7.1.2. That update screwed the battery that was working superb all the time. DANA Try to do a factory reset, it fixes many problem for some user. Margaritas Ante Porcos It was one of the first things I did. Twice. Did not help. Paul_Werner Yeah you got to call Google (if you got yours from the Play Store). They've been replacing 6Ps with factory refurbished ones even out of warranty (source: it happened to me) Matthew Skalecki The update didn't screw up your battery. The battery was going to crap out on you regardless of which Android version you had. This happened to many people including me. Replacing the battery fixes the issue; reverting to a previous os does nothing. Zach Mauch Did you go through Google or a local shop? The Wrath of Kahn Unfortunately it was out of warranty, had a friend with the skills do it for me. JD I need more of this colorful imagery to describe simple everyday problems. mchalakov First off you are using a beta OS don't complain. Second thing is that battery drain comes mostly from the (bad)apps - if you watched the video or read the article you could understand. Third - I'm pretty sure you can go back to Marshmallow if you are so so so unhappy with Nougat or O. Jakst Really? Yesterday was my first day with Android O. I plugged my phone out at 7, and come home at midnight with 35 % battery left. I've never had that kind of battery life in my 6P before. So I've seen huge gains with this O preview. thereasoner The Android O beta I'm using is so slow to charge my Pixel today that it seems like that's what they tackled​....and not in a good way. iFeign Surprise, surprise, you're running BETA software. Smh. thereasoner Yeah I know and I'm sure it will get fixed between now and September. I'm just saying that the current difference in charge time is quite noticable at this point. AbdulB1 maybe they removed quick charge support in beta mattcoz Pixel never had quick charge. AbdulB1 hmm interesting. I thought it has qualcomm processor so it must have qc 3.0 too. Must be some proprietary stuff or qualcomm must be asking for more money to enable it. mattcoz Google is pushing the open USB-C power delivery standard. AbdulB1 Display screen eats up most of my battery. I can't see what google is doing will fix it somehow. We need different types of screens now. iFeign Uhh, it's as if you expect things to use NO battery at all. Infinite battery life! Of course using the screen, aka, using the phone, is going to be the largest proportionate power drain - no matter how fancy the screen tech. AbdulB1 battery tech has still not improved and nor did the screen tech. I can accept that the screen tech will remain same for a long time but as far as batteries are concerned they can be improved , made for longer number of recharge cycles but that hasn't caught up with the manufacturers yet. One thing which can be done is increasing the battery capacity but we all know this is not happening as phone manufactures think it will make phones bulky , add weight and in long term affect the sale of newer devices. Latheryin Multi day battery life will not happen until new battery tech comes around. With people needlessly having screen on times of 5+ hours there is no way to keep a battery charged for extended periods. Krzysztof Jozwik I average 2 hours of screen on time a day. Just because some use their phone 24/7 doesn't mean we all do. I have a job where I'm not on my phone, at home I have better screens to get info from. The phone is there when I need it. Your nonstop use case is not the norm. Latheryin As do I but that is not the norm. Might want to look at any forum about battery life and looking at screen on times. Most want and use 5+ hours. It's mainly the older generation like us that doesn't need it and are not on the device all the time. Krzysztof Jozwik Obviously the forums about battery life have people winning that they want 48 hours of screen on. That is not the norm. Sure, lots of people want that, most do not. Latheryin Most want more screen on time. Why do you think battery life is such an issue. disqusdeeznuts My Moto Z Play begs to differ. Motorola does it right with this phone. It has a good size battery (3510), an efficient processor, and runs smooth. It can be done, but for some reason, it just isn't a focus for a majority of manufacturers. Latheryin Well sure all the devices with that mid range chip and battery combo can get ok battery life. I could easily. Get 2 days out of my device and it only has a 3200 battery. It is not the oem. It's people. They need to spend less time look at their phone and more time living life. Which many are unprepared for. Cakefish I'm going the leaked Moto X4 continues that legacy onwards! Rod Ever heard of the Moto z Play, or Lenovo P2? Latheryin As already stated on that. The moto has a mid tear chip. As for the Lenovo, nope. Can't say I have, it's either not sold in my country or a mid low tier device that I wouldn't have noticed. Just looked. They both use the same mid tier chip. Also that does have a good battery. But that like the K1000 with a 10000 battery are the exception and seldom are they flagship quality. WarpspeedScp The Moto z does not have an SD 820 on it. Neither does the P2. It's very annoying that manufacturers can't give us something functional instead of eye-candy for once. Rod While it's not top of line sillicon, real world testes have proven that, for everyday tasks, there's virtually no difference between the S625 ans 821 WarpspeedScp Well, my phone has an SD 650, and dolphin emulator just about keeps up (wind waker and super smash Bros). On an 820, there would definitely be better results. Paul Troy I have a better idea. Get the hardware manufacturers to put a bigger battery in their devices. 💡 Taedirk If we could convince hardware manufacturers to do something useful, we wouldn't be on yet another revision to how Android updates the OS. Alex Yeah so this way the horrible wakelocks (that Android makes almost impossible to manage) will be less visible. Cakefish Why not both? Zach Mauch All I want to know is can they stop wakelocks. JD Same bullshit every year. I'll believe it when I see it. Unless Android O somehow allows me to download more mAh. Morten Ulv Are you trying to say Android battery life hasn't improved VASTLY over the years? JD Yep in fact it's regressed Morten Ulv I have no such issues. Better battery all across the board. JD What ever you're smoking pass that shit around Morten Ulv Your shit must be stronger than mine. browngeek I miss the days of my Xperia Z3 Lollipop and Stamina mode. Used to get 48 hours and 5-6 hours SOT. D13H4RD2L1V3 I hope this actually does something when the final build is out. I'm getting tired of hearing of every new battery improvement in a new version of Android only to have a wakelock pretty much make all of that moot. Dennis Ulijn I am on the Android O beta, and i must say that the information i get from it it really useful! I never could find the wakelocks because i'm not rooted, but now i can easily see what apps use up battery in the background. Awake meditation app was in use for 15 minutes (meditation) and active in the background for 1 hour (basically, ever since the meditation)! "Restrict background usage" to on, and we'll see what it brings tomorrow. PI this is interesting .... :) ,, Whats the current update Dennis Ulijn I'm in Europe so I just woke up. I'll let you know end of the day. Dennis Ulijn k. End of the day here. The apps (pocketcasts and aware) behaved nicely now. at 23%, which is not that great with 2 hours of screen on time and 32% and 5%of the battery used up by system and services respectively. (apps 32%, system 32%, services 5%, Cell standby 3%, idle 2%, bluetooth and wifi 0%) PI System 32% ,,, ???? Dennis Ulijn Yeah, last weeks i had the bug where system was using a lot of battery... I don't care right now, because i'm not expecting good battery life while on a beta. I did find a fix for system battery usage on Reddit though, which is to reset app preferences (which mostly only resets permissions and things like default apps. PI When in fist saw it ,,I was like WTH 32% but then it's beta software ,,so we kinda expect it . Yes per app battery usage section with foreground and background Info is really great . But I suspect google play services and Android os battery section will not be effective that much unless they show wahts making them to suck up battery . Sabin Bajracharya Meanwhile Google's own apps will somehow be able to bypass this restriction :D Michael Sørensen Google's own location services, Now cards, Chrome, etc. eats the most battery for me - even worse with location history on. How about fixing that first...? WarpspeedScp Try Firefox! Also, turn location off as soon as you can. mlm5em But with O, you can now turn off Background activity on an app specific basis. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/eaaaef5de863733535628a24f5b0d44f888ae3ff0cb89d1c8cffc0680083c526.png mattcoz Good to see there's an option to turn it off. Morten Ulv Very handy! IncCo Anything that improves the battery life is awesome John Monks I have concerns about this. There are some apps I *want* running in the background, but I don't want them filling up the notification shade. One example, Lightflow has to have a pointless notification in order to do the job I installed it to do. I know it's there, any consequences for my battery life are mine to live with. It would be OK if I could toggle a setting to permit a particular app to run a 'free running background service' silently but this is Google so I expect I'll have to put up with spam instead (and no, collapsed notifications are still notifications), or there will be a toggle that does nothing, like the 'ignore optimisation' setting that currently exists. Drakenoid There apparently is, check comments above, there's a screenshot. David Onter You can disable all notifications from an app, which removes the permanent notification. Cakefish It's about damn time. All hail Android O. AdamH So does it mean my phone will be useless? something_new Apple was right then Đức Thành I'm beginning to get excited again, even knowing that actually achieving this would take many years. Fidelator Allow us, the end user, to have absolute control over which apps can run in the background under certain conditions, I have disabled notifications on Facebook and Instagram yet they still have multiple persistent RAM hogging battery sucking services 100% of the time smeddy My next phone won't get a look-in without a 4000mah+ battery in it. Since Samsung dropped the removable battery, battery anxiety has crept back into my life. abc Multi-day battery life? Ha! I solved this over a decade ago. The key to long battery life is having an actual life. Have friends and family and an active social life. Don't be the loser who keeps fiddling with his phone every few mins, when everyone already knows you don't get any important messages. You'll be amazed how long your battery lasts when you aren't pulling out to jerk off on it every few mins. And for god's sake, at home, a cell phone should be no different than a landline. If you're watching videos or playing games on your 5" inch screen, you need to invest in a PC or console. Sk0ly Good for Google. Some apps, particularly Facebook and Facebook messenger run ALWAYS in the background, even when you haven't used the applications in days. In my opinion, this is just lazy coding and is likely due to Facebook's data mining. In comparison, Hangouts and Allo only run on demand. Android has always allowed developers freedom to responsibly code their apps to allow them to do more. This is recognition that this freedom has been abused and now developers have to be treated more similarly to how they are on iOS.

 An internal Google email reveals more evidence of the company's tip line for reporting whistle-blowers Steve Kovach May 22, 2017, 10:12 AM 7,362 facebook linkedin twitter email print REUTERS/ Ruben Sprich A new filing in a lawsuit against Google shows evidence that the company's rumored team that tracks down employees who leak information does indeed exist. The email comes from a lawsuit filed by an anonymous Google employee who claims the company runs a "spying program" that encourages employees to report each other for leaking information to the press or public, as The Information first reported in December. The lawsuit says the program violates California labor law. According to the latest filing, which was first spotted by The Verge, the email was written by Brian Katz, who identifies himself as the leader of Google's "Investigations team," which includes the "stopleaks@" tip line that allegedly encourages Google employees to report leakers. The email refers to an incident last year when a transcript from an internal all-hands "TGIF" meeting leaked to Recode. The email says the employees who leaked the transcript and memes were identified and fired and warns employees against leaking internal information to the press. A Google spokesperson sent the following statement to Business Insider, but didn't address the "stopleaks@" program at the center of the lawsuit: "We're very committed to transparency and having an open culture, which means we frequently share with employees confidential details of product launches and other types of sensitive, proprietary business information," the spokesperson said in a written email statement. "Our employee confidentiality policies are designed to protect that information, without preventing employees from disclosing information about their terms and conditions of employment, or workplace concerns."

Here are all the Instant Apps announced at Google I/O Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 2:36pm PDTMay 18, 2017 45 Plus 1 on G+ 139 Share on Facebook 74 Share on Twitter Total Shares258 Google News Instant apps were announced one year ago at Google I/O 2016, but only now are they rolling out to a large amount of users. Now any developer can make instant apps, and Google showed off a massive list of them at a session earlier today (seen above). Some of the highlights include Vimeo for watching videos, Jet for shopping, Periscope for watching live streams, The Weather Channel, and even the New York Times crossword puzzle. Most of these already have mobile web app versions, but the point is that Instant Apps provide a native application experience. Even though the Instant Apps feature is already rolled out to me, I'm unable to use some of these, perhaps indicating that some are still in testing. For example, I couldn't get the Weather Channel or Periscope ones to work, but Vimeo and Jet did. Instant apps currently work on Android 6.0 or higher.

If you were already using them, you'd have them installed and have no need for an instant app. Shazmil Nassar Well if you're using it you won't get the instant app at all when you search. . . boop I've yet to figure out how instant apps work. DieselBeats Basically the experience of the app without having to download it. It's moreso if you are really only going to use the app once so it's not just hogging up space on your phone and never being used. boop I now that much. I mean I've never been able to pull one up. Sruly J Do you have the Google Play Services for Instant Apps app installed? Michel S. weird, why can't I find that in the Play Store? (on Android O beta, en-US) Sruly J It's not available through the Play Store. Officially the app is supposed to roll out to devices in the background, with the same going for updates. It's available on APK Mirror though. Richard Riker in theory you should get a button when you google for the app. But it may be US only at the moment, having the location set to en-us doesn't help. And at least in the show-off at last years I/O you should have such a button in the play store too. But you'll have to have Play Services for Instant apps and activate them in the play services settings antonio cesar you must have a specific google play services called google play services for instant apps, it dosent come preloaded David Onter It downloads native mini-apps in the background and displays them to you instead of the website when you click on a link. Jpx I remember when I was sent a zillow link from my girlfriend last month. It used instant apps and I freaked out. I was rambling to her like she had any idea what I was talking about. It is such a great feature, that really doesn't feel like a big deal. Which means its amazing. Sir_Brizz "amoutsn" Carson Saldanha "amountsn fo" Sir_Brizz LOL Total Insecurity XDD Total Insecurity XD Carson Saldanha I have instant apps enabled, but they don't show up in search results. (I'm on Google US btw) Renaud Lepage What the HELL is the CBC in there for? abqnm So if you're searching for something and the result points to the CBC, you get the instant app for CBC. Not only Canadians get news from the CBC. Say, for example if you're from the US, you probably won't have the app installed, but you may get a CBC news story or such in your search results, so by providing an instant app, the user gets mostly the same experience as they would if they had the app installed. Renaud Lepage I know the why, I'm Canadian. I'm just surprised they actually gave enough of a shit to do an Instant App. abqnm Alright, point. But it's not like the instant apps are hard if you already have an app. I guess maybe they are focusing on engagement in search more now. That's really what these are. Renaud Lepage If I'm being an insufferable pedant (and trust me, I am), sometimes, a pre-existing app's lifecycle could ACTUALLY *really* not support the Instant App approach. Case in point, applications that have a Shared Account login: I'm not sure that's allowed. skillfulshoe I keep catching my phone "downloading" an update but it is for instant apps and the notification disappears within a second. Anyone know what is happening? Corbin Davenport That's the support library/APK for instant apps updating. skillfulshoe I've seen it do that about 5 times in the past few days. Anyways, thanks for the answer! Mike in KC I've noticed the same thing on my phone as well. Ozl Awesome, i cant wait to ditch my iPhone for a new Pixel 2.0 whenever they are available xD Jack Smith Two of us. Looking forward to getting a Pixel 2. Just hope I can get my hands on one. Ozl Yes, ill be there waiting to click that buy button on day one xD mehmehmeh I have noticed that since I switched back from iPhone to the S8+ that app updates seem smaller. Did they change how apps are updated in the 6ish months I was away from Android? iFeign Delta updates http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/07/23/new-play-store-tools-help-developers-to-shrink-the-size-of-app-updates/ patkoscsaba So. I have Google Play services for Instant Apps installed. I am also a beta user for Google App. How do I get an instant app? Can someone provide a step by step example with a an existing app? João Victor Schiavo What is your country? patkoscsaba Romania. João Victor Schiavo I'm in Brazil, I guess we are out of lucky. 😣 iAndroHacker Mine installed instant-apps services for a month ago but how do i use it? Nate Harris Pretty sure Instant Apps are supposed to work all the way back to KitKat. They specifically demoed it on KitKat at last year's I/O João Victor Schiavo They promised Jelly Bean up... BlackeyeX2 Better yet, post links for each one so we can try it out... boo Jay Does anyone have an actual "list" of these apps with names? I don't recognize 80-90% of these app icons.

Because of everything happening in the country, many have turned to Google to ask about the crisis, the country, and the refugees. To answer all of these questions and more, Google has partnered with UNHCR to create Searching for Syria… UAG Samsung Galaxy S8 Cases Over the last six years, over five million people have not only had to leave their homes but also their family and friends, as they’ve made their way out of the war-stricken country. In that time, Google.org has invested over $20 million in grant money to help over 800,000 refugees. Searching for Syria is a joint venture between Google and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees as a way to provide answers to the world’s questions. Using the UNHCR’s extensive data on Syria and Google Search trends, Searching for Syria answers questions such as “What is happening in Syria?” and “What is a refugee?” while also providing a thorough background on the history of Syria. If you would like to know more about Google’s partnership with UNHCR, you can head on over and read the full blog post. You can also go to searchingforsyria.org to learn more about Syria, the crisis, and what you can do to help.

Tech Industry by Katie Collins May 22, 2017 6:15 AM PDT @katiecollins European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager has led the fight against Google. John Thys/AFP/Getty Images The European Union's years-long, seemingly never-ending investigation into Google is coming to an end at last, according to an EU official. Regulators will rule in the next few months on whether Google abused its dominant position to get people to use its apps and services over those of rivals, Reuters reported Monday. The tech giant is accused of guiding people who use its platforms like search and Android toward picking its own services by promoting them high up in listings and toward using its own apps by insisting they get preloaded on phones. The EU is worried this may have stopped people from discovering other services and apps that may better suit their needs. The pan-European governing body has gone toe to toe with tech companies for almost as long as people have had personal computers and other gadgets close at hand, dating back at least to its landmark judgment against Microsoft in 2004. More recently the targets of its investigations have included Apple, for its tax practices; Amazon, for e-book deals; and Facebook and Twitter, for hate speech on their sites. Europe's Competition Commission is examining three separate antitrust complaints against Google, one of which dates back to 2010. If the EU decides Google is breaking its rules, it could fine the company up to 10 percent of its annual global turnover for each case. "In the next few months, we will reach a decision on the Google cases, Google search, AdSense and to me the most interesting is Android," Tommaso Valletti, the Commission's chief competition economist, told a conference organized by the University of Oxford's Centre for Competition Law and Policy. A spokesman for the EU Competition Commission did not immediately respond to a request for further comment. Special Reports: CNET's in-depth features in one place.

But it seems the tech company wants to finally punish apps that demonstrate poor stability and power efficiency. Announced at the recently concluded Google I/O, Google is introducing Android Vitals for its developers. This initiative aims to analyze various metrics and scores of an app in relation to speed, security, and stability. Google will be looking at things like “App not responding (ANR) rates,” “Crash rate,” “Slow rendering,” Frozen frames,” “Stuck wake locks,” and “Excessive wake-ups.” Using these metrics Google will see which apps are ranked at the bottom 25 percent. The penalty for these apps is they might no longer be visible on the Play Store. If this helps improve the quality of apps that show up on the Play Store, then we’re all for it.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) for control of your car’s infotainment system for several years now. Google’s Android Auto and Apple’s CarPlay are now mainstream and offered in hundreds of new vehicles and third-party car stereos. Source: Google However, these two systems don’t go deeper than that in-dash display and require a smartphone to be present. One of the announcements from last week’s Google I/O changes that. Android Automotive is a new initiative that integrates Android much deeper, letting Google’s operating system control systems like the air conditioning and power windows. Google is pushing to make Android an embedded OS that runs your car’s systems — not just an infotainment system that runs on top. It has its first two partners in Volvo and Volkswagen AG (ADR)’s (OTCMKTS:VLKAY) Audi. This is a development that should be worrying to BlackBerry Ltd (NASDAQ:BBRY) as it represents a direct attack on that company’s profitable QNX division. Google Announces Android Automotive While much of Google I/O 2017 was dominated by artificial intelligence and AI-powered smart camera features like Google Lens, Android Automotive was also introduced. Audi and Volvo both showed off concept vehicles that use Android Automotive instead of a proprietary embedded operating system. According to Google, both auto makers are building Android into their next generation of cars. Android Automotive Is Not Android Auto While the naming of the two systems is confusingly similar, Android Automotive is not the same thing as Android Auto. Like Apple CarPlay, Android Auto is a layer than runs on top of a car’s existing infotainment system. It relies on a user’s smartphone to interact with and it is focused on services like playing music, navigation and playing back messages. Conversely, Android Automotive is a version of Android designed to be an embedded operating system — the software that runs that infotainment system. It can support apps without a smartphone present. It can control other functions in the car, such as power windows and seats, the sunroof and the car’s heating and cooling system. Critical dashboard display info like speed usually has its own dedicated system, but Android Automotive could also control other information in that instrument cluster. In other words, Google is gunning for the territory where BlackBerry’s QNX division is currently a leader. However, Google will have the advantage of integration potential with billions of other Android devices, ranging from smartphones to smart speakers, along with massive third-party developer support. Android Automotive Is Also Not Waymo or Project Titan Google has a long-standing self-driving car project, now known as Waymo. Apple also has self-driving automotive system ambitions in its Project Titan.

clock menu more-arrow How Anker is beating Apple and Samsung at their own accessory game by Nick Statt@nickstatt May 22, 2017, 10:19am EDT Illustrations by William Joel Photography by James Bareham share tweet Linkedin Steven Yang quit his job at Google in the summer of 2011 to build the products he felt the world needed: a line of reasonably priced accessories that would be better than the ones you could buy from Apple and other big-name brands. These accessories — batteries, cables, chargers — would solve our most persistent gadget problem by letting us stay powered on at all times. There were just a few problems: Yang knew nothing about starting a company, building consumer electronics, or selling products. “I was a software engineer all my life at Google. I didn’t know anyone in the electronics manufacturing world,” Yang tells me over Skype from his office in Shenzhen, China. But he started the company regardless, thanks in no small part to his previous experience with Amazon’s sellers marketplace, a platform for third-party companies and tiny one- or two-person teams interested in selling directly to consumers. He named the company Anker, after the German word for ship anchor. The steady rise of the company’s profile... is proof that it’s possible to meet one very specific consumer need and ride that wave Anker has since become the most popular brand of portable battery packs on Amazon. Portable chargers had a bit of a standout moment last summer, when players of the wildly-popular and battery-hogging Pokémon Go could be seen roaming the streets, their phones constantly plugged in. But these accessories have existed for years as a remedy for our battery woes since the standard smartphone tends to last no more than a day on a single charge. So in airports, the back of cabs, and on city streets we’re plugging into lithium-ion slabs in our pockets and bags to stay connected. The market for portable battery packs generated $360 million in the 12 months ending in March, 2017 in the US alone. The brands behind these packs are largely anonymous — Kmashi, Jackery, and iMuto — and they often stay that way. Except Anker. The steady rise of the company’s profile is proof that it’s possible to meet one very specific consumer need and ride that wave as it continues to ripple out to other markets. A majority of Anker’s sales come from cables and wall chargers, and it’s now moving into the smart home and auto market — anywhere a plug and a cable can solve a problem. Yang and his team started a company with the sole purpose of selling a better third-party accessory. But they stumbled onto a more lucrative reality: mobile phones, once niche luxury items, are now ubiquitous centerpieces of our digital lives. Each of these phones, and all the products that connect to them, need their own cable and plug. And each and every day these devices die before we want them to. PowerCore 10000 If there’s anything you should know about smartphone development over the last ten years, it’s this: batteries are not lasting longer. Phones may be thinner and faster, with larger screens and better cameras, but they don’t stay powered for longer than a day, perhaps 36 hours at best. The culprit is the fundamental science of lithium-ion batteries, which are tremendous at storing energy but only within limited size and capacity constraints. The lithium-ion batteries we have today operate at about a fifth of their potential storage capacity, says Lynden Archer, a professor of chemical engineering at Cornell University. And yet that’s still at about 90 percent of the maximum potential today’s battery science allows. “A breakthrough would require a new paradigm,” he says. “A huge part of Anker’s success is the fact that our batteries don’t last long enough.” That stagnation has allowed Anker to flourish. “A huge part of Anker’s success is the fact that our batteries don’t last long enough,” says Joanna Stern, a technology columnist and gadget reviewer for The Wall Street Journal. “They saw that accessories needed to be made to address customers’ pain points. They’re making the chargers, the cases, the cords — and they’re making it for affordable prices so you can have one of these in every place you are.” Mobile battery packs weren’t the company’s initial goal. In the late 2000s, Yang identified a consumer need not being met: well-built, reliable laptop battery replacements. “You have a Dell or HP laptop — let’s assume you got it in 2009 — and in 2011 the battery is dying and you want to get a new one,” he says. Back then you had two choices: buy directly from Dell or HP, with a high price tag, or buy a white-label battery that’s cheap but poorly made. “Which one do I want to buy?” asks Yang. “The answer is neither of them.” Yang saw a desire for a better type of accessory — one that wouldn’t cost as much as a replacement straight from the original manufacturer, but that would be of a high enough quality to earn consumers’ trust. Before he could sell that product, he needed to figure out how to make it. It was a long and painful process. After he quit his job at Google in July of 2011, Anker took 12 months just to prototype its first laptop battery. That was even after Yang and the core team moved to Shenzhen to find reliable manufacturing partners. “I knew that if I stayed in California and had people FedEx me prototypes in a week, it was just not going to work,” he says. Many hardware companies, especially crowdfunded ones in the US, learn that lesson the hard way, by missing deadlines and hitting snags that lead to months-long delays. A solid supply chain is so crucial to a hardware company’s survival that there’s an entire consulting industry around helping startups find suppliers and set expectations. Critical to avoiding these pitfalls was Dongpong Zhao, Google’s then-head of sales in China. Zhao joined Anker in early 2012, and helped Yang build out the company’s supply chain. Anker was made up of around ten people at the time. “Think of it as a small family business instead of like an actual company,” Yang says. The company tirelessly built out a supply chain in its first year and began testing its first products — the laptop chargers and batteries it would begin selling direct to consumers on Amazon. “We were able to make cell phone battery cells that actually had slightly better capacity,” Yang says. “That got us quite the reputation.” From there, Anker ventured into smartphone batteries with a replacement unit for the HTC Sensation. “We were able to make cellphone battery cells that actually had slightly better capacity,” Yang says. “That got us quite the reputation.” Early on, Anker developed close relationships with suppliers in Asia, including Panasonic and anode supplier BTR, to help test and quickly develop new batteries. Yang says he and Anker’s small team “definitely saw the explosion of smart devices” as its biggest and most obvious opportunity, and Anker started aggressively expanding into portable battery packs, wall chargers, and cables. By the end of 2012, after shifting more resources toward portable chargers, Yang says Anker went from selling 100 to 1,000 products per day. “The challenge wasn’t selling products,” Yang says. “It was making products and making sure they were high-quality as well. That’s why we spent a majority of our effort on R&D and product development.” The company does a majority of its sales directly to consumers over Amazon Marketplace, where a combination of strong reviews, low prices, and prominent placement in search rankings can turn a single product into a lucrative line. For the accessories market, which tends to piggyback off trends in mainstream consumer electronics, a true breakthrough is rare. But Anker found one in charging, based on the realization that while batteries may not be improving, charging time certainly was. According a study conducted last year by PhoneArena, it took more than two hours on average to charge a device to 100 percent in 2013. Today, it can be done in almost half the time. So Anker set out to make the fastest chargers available. Take the PowerPort 5, a matte black rectangle no larger than a deck of playing cards, with five USB ports. When it was first introduced in 2015, it was the only accessory on the market capable of charging five devices simultaneously at optimal speed. Or the company’s standard PowerCore portable charger, roughly the size of a credit card and just under one inch thick — a white block encasing 10,000mAh of lithium-ion battery cells. It has four pinholes that light up in LED blue when you press an elliptical button on the top to check its remaining charge. It can refill a depleted iPhone 7 in just over 60 minutes nearly four times over before it needs to be recharged. Most Anker charging products have one signature: the PowerIQ logo. Launched in 2013, the company’s proprietary charging standard is now present on nearly all of its batteries and wall plugs. The technology, carried by a small chip inside each charger, identifies whatever device is being plugged in, be it an iPhone 7 Plus, Google Pixel, or an iPad Pro 9.7-inch, in order to detect and deliver the maximum current the product allows. Anker says the technology can shave hours off the amount of time it takes to reach a full charge. A next-generation version of the chip, a sequel to PowerIQ, is slated to start shipping in new Anker charging products later this year, allowing for smaller and lighter accessories. On top of its products’ technical advantages, Anker banks on looks to make its chargers stand out. Brand manager Elisa Lu says every device’s packaging is carefully thought out from the moment customers receive the product, to when they open it and use it. Devices come in a white and light-blue box with the name Anker printed in all caps across the front. Inside is a meticulously packaged arrangement of lightweight cardboard. Anker products carry that new-gadget smell — a blend of peculiar odors from the evaporation of chemical compounds in the plastics and the epoxy coatings of the device. Beside its red cables, which Anker offers in both standard and braided nylon versions, and a single one-off red battery pack, the company sells products in only two color options: black and white. All this has a strategic business purpose. “When our consumers receive our products, we want to make sure they know they are getting it from a reliable and trustworthy company,” Lu says. Brand trust is a pivotal consideration when purchasing what may seem like random electronics off Amazon. Inside the the box with Anker’s larger products, you’ll also find a small square piece of paper with two questions: are you happy, or are you unhappy? If you’re unhappy, a block of text instructs you to contact Anker customer support via phone, email, or on its website. If you’re satisfied, it asks you to tell your friends or family. Better yet, leave an Amazon review. PowerCore Slim 5000 In many ways, Anker’s success is born from the failures of premier manufacturers like Apple and Samsung. Where those companies introduce points of friction — like ever-thinner devices with short battery lives — Anker offers a remedy. “My feeling is that Anker is a success because Apple offers such subpar and expensive accessories,” says Stern, who’s often recommended Anker products in her WSJ column. It may be surprising that Apple sat idly as the accessory market ballooned around it; it took the company years to develop its own battery case for the iPhone to compete with Mophie. But Apple has always favored high margins on premium products, even the cables and earbuds it sells in the Apple Store. This has given ample room to companies like Anker, with the low overhead of an e-commerce business, to sell similar products of near-identical quality for $10 to $20 cheaper. And where Apple and others failed to develop products of their own like multi-port wall plugs and portable chargers, Anker saw the opportunity and capitalized on it. The company is quick to fill gaps created by smartphone manufacturers. When Apple removed the headphone jack on the iPhone 7, for instance, Anker saw a giant opportunity to begin producing new dongles and other cable adapters to help consumers adjust. But mastering Amazon was the real key to securing Anker’s future. Search for a generic accessory like “cell phone wall charger” or “Lightning cable” and you’ll find the Anker brand high up in the search results If you head over to Amazon.com right now and peruse the retailer’s most popular smartphone accessories and you’ll find Anker products at the top. Search for a generic accessory like “cell phone wall charger” or “Lightning cable” and you’ll find the Anker brand high up in the search results, typically with a 4.5 or 5-star rating. In fact, Anker products take up the first five slots on Amazon’s list of best-selling portable batteries. And alongside the ratings, you’ll find thousands of customer reviews — reviews that the company scans meticulously for ideas on how to improve their development process. Two years before he left Google, Yang became intimately familiar with Amazon’s Marketplace when he built an automated system for a friend who was selling third-party products on Amazon as a side business. It essentially took care of aspects of the business like inventory, logistics and fulfillment, and sales tracking. “It took me two months, evenings and weekends, to develop this system,” Yang explained in a video produced by Amazon last year to promote entrepreneurship on its platform. “Within a month, she was fulfilling 300 orders a day.” Building this system gave Yang invaluable insight into how third-party selling on Amazon functioned. He discovered what worked and what didn’t, and how entire brands could crop up overnight and fade into obscurity the next day. Anker thrived by borrowing infrastructure from Amazon and relying on engineering and support in China. “Amazon provides loads of services — financial services, fulfillment. It actually makes selling a low-barrier thing,” Yang says. Although the company attempted to handle its own fulfillment in its early days, it eventually discovered it could not compete with what Amazon offered. Now, about 95-percent of Anker’s products are listed as “Fulfilled by Amazon.” You can build an online retail business off Amazon, but making sure your products get exposure is the hard part. “The biggest challenge for Anker is not sales. It’s customer perception,” Yang says. “People think they need [Apple’s] cube charger and stock cable.” Teaching people that there is a superior product out there, and then convincing them to keep buying, is Anker’s core challenge. “Amazon reviews were really enormously helpful,” Yang says. “The Amazon reviews just come and come automatically.” PowerLine+ USB-C to USB 3.0 Silicon Valley is full of breathless mission statements designed to inspire and justify the power and influence of technology, like Apple’s famous “think different” slogan, and Google’ ominous and now defunct “don’t be evil” mantra. Facebook, back in 2012, celebrated its billion-user milestone with an ad comparing the social network to chairs, bridges, and even nations. Anker has never aspired to such grand ambitions. “At Anker, we can't exactly help you unwind,” the company admits on its Amazon sellers page. Instead, Anker takes a more straightforward approach by solving the inevitable problems technology creates. “Say goodbye to first-world tech woes like oppressive low batteries and limited ports,” the page says. “Say hello to an easier, smarter life.” Yang is trying to extend this simple philosophy to categories like headphones, speakers, phone cases, and now smart home appliances under a new brand called Eufy. Launched last September, Eufy is Anker’s avenue for selling things like Roomba clones, desk lamps, and bathroom scales. Expanding into more product categories is a logical evolution for Anker, but it’s also a response to a looming existential threat: Yang says he foresees a future where portable chargers won’t be necessary due to advancements in both fast charging and wireless charging. “I think we all agree that the portable charger isn’t forever,” Yang says. But consumers will always need wall plugs and cables, and Anker sees its goal now as keeping pace with changing standards, like the introduction of USB-C. PowerCore 5000 In the meantime, Yang says it’s diversifying with a future expansion into audio, smart home, and automotive product lines. Anker already produces Bluetooth headphones and speakers, but it has aspirations to compete with the likes of Harman Kardon and Bose. Key to the success of those products is moving to brick-and-mortar retailers. Terrence Wang, the company’s chief marketing officer hired from Procter & Gamble in 2015, says having a presence in Best Buy and Walmart, a process that began last year, is the next stage of Anker’s evolution. “Expanding from online to offline is critical actually,“ Wang says. “We are trying to get as many people to know that they have a simple, convenient, portable, fast solution rather than just have to bring their own charger wherever they go. That’s the original brand vision.” The company’s focus on storefront retail is a response to a second very real threat — dependence on a direct-to-consumer online-only model. The company has found it difficult these days to launch new products on Amazon. Older products have thousands of reviews, while newer ones need to earn placement in the search rankings and collect testimonials before more cautious buyers pull the trigger. “We’re seeing a bit of a dilemma on that one,” Yang says. “To a lot of people, the original charger and the original cable are the only means to charge their devices.” The company is also struggling with its complex product line, with a dizzying number of choices that may alienate consumers who are looking for a simple choice. “We’re converging to this generation approach,” Yang says. “So we’ll try to release a generation of products every 18 to 24 months.” Choosing which products to promote at Best Buy, which to discontinue, and where to put resources for the future are all part of Anker’s growing pains. The company’s success hinges on convincing — or “educating” — their consumers about the value of what they’re offering. Yang likes to tell a story about a moment he sees play out on repeat every single time he’s at an airport, anywhere on the planet. He sees people, smartphones in hand, rushing from outlet to outlet, looking for space with “the little Apple cube in their hands” and running out of options. “To a lot of people, the original charger and the original cable are the only means to charge their devices, in their mind,” he says. “I look at those people and I always want to go up to them and talk to them.” Instead, Yang and the Anker team started conducting an annual consumer survey. It has only one question: how often does your smartphone run out of battery? Once every day? Once a week? Once a month? Or perhaps never? “Forty percent of people say their battery ran out at least once last week, another 40 percent say at least once last month,” Yang says. “As long as these numbers don’t go down, I think we have a lot of work to do.” Policy & Law PayPal burns Pandora to the ground in lawsuit over logo similarities Circuit Breaker The Finger Spinner iOS game is about free-to-play monetization, not fidget spinning Circuit Breaker Amazon Video can now stream in 4K on Xbox One S View all stories in Tech Loading comments...

Google thwarts recent attempt to genericize its trademarked brand name Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/17 8:21am PDTMay 17, 2017 10 Plus 1 on G+ 46 Share on Facebook 34 Share on Twitter Total Shares90 Google News Google might have joined the common vernacular — it was entered into the venerable Oxford English Dictionary back in 2006, after all — but it has staunchly resisted attempts to render the actual trademark "Google" invalid. A recent suit to invalidate the term has been decided in Google's favor, so that's one more attempt thwarted. Instead of joining the vaulted halls of cellophane, linoleum, and thermos, Google will remain a trademark. Genericization is a big problem for big businesses. Companies like Xerox and Zamboni have had to launch ad campaigns in the past to keep their terms out of common use. This particular suit originated off of an earlier conflict back in 2012 in which Google wrangled back some squatted domains that used their trademark. The domain-holder then filed suit to try to have Google's trademark invalidated. A decision in Google's favor was reached in 2014, and with the most recent ruling, all realistic subsequent appeals have now been exhausted. At least for now, Google's trademark is safe. Realistically, though, it's not as if anyone says they are going to Google something and then use Bing, right? To Google is to Google.

I'll just "duckduckgo" that. Just to check what's going on with Google. JPLoureiro I shall Ask Jeeves about said Duck. Max Johnson I was going to say that. Lol. thartist rolls off the tongue! JPLoureiro Google be like: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9442c103b06f02e26bb50b06104ad7260df9f7af5e6215c0c7525d1ddad1f2dd.jpg Latheryin I really wish I could say that, but the other day I told someone to Google something and they sure enough opened the edge browser and used bing. I know a few then refer to any Internet search as googling. Even heard a teacher refer to it once. I made sure to clarify. Matt Well, if Bing was set as the default search engine, did you really expect the person to type in google.com just because you said to google it? Christopher Bement Yes. JRomeo it's not that. it's that they think searching on bing is a form of googling it. Latheryin Bingo. Too many people really think googling is a term for an Internet search. abc lol. That's probably because it is and the Oxford dictionary defines it as such. Christopher Bement Seriously, punch this person. It is so irritating. Where did you find this out? On google. When they really mean, I opened CHROME, and searched bing or yahoo or aol. Martin You asking them to google something and them then using Bing is not the same thing as them calling using Bing "googling". My guess is that they interpreted your request as "search the web", and used their search engine of choice. Just like I fire up Google Music whenever someone tells me to search for something on Spotify, because I know what they really mean is "listen to this track". Latheryin I am a firm believer in say what you mean and mean what you say. All that says is people can't follow simple directions. If I meant use bing then I would have said to use bing, or Yahoo or what ever. marcusmarcus2 If you are a firm believer in say what you mean, you should tell them to search for something on google or do a google search for it. Saying google it does not fully say what you mean. Google does a lot now a days. You could mean search something, put it in a google document, email through googles email, invent 5 different messaging apps for said thing, buy said thing for the patents and turn around and sell it. All could technically mean googling something. Latheryin No I could not mean that as it is not what I said. If I say to Google it then there really is only one way to do that. If a person can't follow those simple instructions then normally I really start to question their worth to the company in their currant roll. Google search is the only product from Google that is used in the office. Everything else I Microsoft or company based. mxwp well this is what the genericize suit is about. "googling" something has already become genericized as using a q-tip. so that is what you mean when you tell something to google it. so they are not being an idiot and instead just makes you sound like a pedantic prick. are you going to get mad that i used a Target brand cotton swab instead of a Q-Tip? next time specify that you literally want someone to use the Google search engine if you really care about "meaning what you say." Martin I can picture you emptying a salt shaker into your hand when someone asks you to pass the salt. 😜 Latheryin Hope they can catch. I said that to my father once. Haha abc If google is used as a verb, it means "to use a search engine" not "to use Google search". Latheryin That is what Google just fought to stop and I'm betting now we will see that removed from the terms. 4Ui812 I'm gonna have to Lycos this story to make sure it checks out. :-) dizel123 I just asked Jeeves and he said its legit 4Ui812 I'm gonna double check that with Dogpile (it was Google before Google was born) dizel123 I never heard of Dogpile, so I looked it up on Excite. Seems pretty cool. George Alta Vista also confirms the story is legit. 4Ui812 Damn , I forgot about Excite lol . You get 1,000 up votes. Anu6is Felt the same way when I read his comment. lol Codemonkey83 I was going to check Infoseek (1994) about this ... but they dead :-( Tabe Has anyone crosschecked this with Hotbot? Lon Grove Hotbot was definitely the go to in the pre-Google days. UKTK8 Tripled checked on cuil. Still legit. vzwuser76 What? No mention of Netscape Navigator? C'mon people! Ammar "Realistically, though, it's not as if anyone says they are going to Google something and then use Bing, right?" I won't be surprised if this actually happens. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Bing it to find out. si3ge you mean google it? Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Do I? si3ge yes Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Oh, okay then. marcusmarcus2 I duck duck goosed it, it turned around and slapped me. Tomáš Petrík You mean you duck duck went it? Elemetrix Yea it definitely happens from people less computer literate. To google it means to use whatever search option happens to be on their browser homepage. Matt Update: I recently heard someone say "You can google it on Facebook." Gregory But it's only the companies themselves for whom that brand recognition is important. Most people couldn't care less. vladashram Not really. Slap the term Google Infront of any product and increase it's sales. People like their brands. If Google were to lose the Google trademark, imagine the quantity of items being sold that use the term Google in the name. Colin Richardson Every Chinisium grade (read: worthless) item would be Google Lock, Google Dock, Google Sock, Google C... you get the idea. Mark Curtis "imagine the quantity of items being sold that use the term Google in the name". Doesn't that already happen? JD Increase it's sales....? Right now I associate anything with Google infront of it as being the Alpha version of that thing. Pixel is the Beta. George Bing is synonymous with Search as Apple is to Innovation... OrionBeast https://media.giphy.com/media/up931VbiJsyze/giphy.gif Christopher Bement Here's more shots: Bing sucks ass. I'm not binging shit. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I thought Bing was the sound your penis makes during its first erection *bing!* Dn Bro I like to use the phrase I'm going to bing that. I think it rolls off the tongue better. George it rolls off your tongue like your head off your shoulders. Daniel In Germany the "duden" has to change it's definition of "googeln" (to google smth) from searching something on the web to search something with Google so Google don't lose the rights on the name Pixelexel But it's important to keep their trademark in control. Wouldn't that be the only way to prevent misuse someone using Google's name to sell a shady service? Cakefish Google = internet search, in my mind. Except when I'm not using Google, which is never. marcusmarcus2 Really? Zamboni had to do an ad campaign to keep their terms out of common use? I guess that is partly my fault. I always referred to street sweepers as a "Road Zamboni". I'm sorry! bekifft This was the correct judgement but I absolutely have seen people "Google" something by searching using whatever was in front of them, usually Yahoo through trickery and deception.

Is this the moment that my Acer Chromebook will finally get Android apps? So far, the answer has always been no, and it doesn’t look like that will change anytime soon. Samsung’s new Chromebook Pro starts shipping on Sunday, but Android apps will remain in beta at least through the summer, as reported last week by The Verge. Google didn’t have much to say about the state of Android on Chrome OS during last week’s annual Google I/O conference. But the company did run a dedicated I/O session aimed at teaching developers how to target their apps for Chromebooks and larger screen devices, as first spotted by Thurrott.com. The big takeaway from that session is that Google is grappling with the same issues we’ve been hearing about for months. At the opening of the session, Google even showed some of its own apps, including Google Maps and Hangouts, that aren’t yet tuned for large screen devices. Basically, the big issues that Android apps need to deal with during the migration to Chromebooks are support for wider screens; including a landscape mode in addition to portrait; allowing for adjusting an app’s window size; and tweaking input approaches to suit a laptop with a keyboard and mouse. The issues aren’t just affecting Chromebooks either. Google said these optimizations can improve the experience on Android-based laptops, as well as newer Android phones that have a desktop mode like Samsung’s Galaxy S8. Google Google Maps running on a Chromebook. Even if an app is lacking some of these tweaks, they can still work pretty well. The wider-screen issue, for example, just makes some apps look odd. The image above is of Google Maps’ explore feature. All the content is in the middle of a screen, while the menu is stretched out across the entire display. Similarly, not having a landscape mode just means that an app feels cramped on a laptop, but it’s still usable. The bigger issue, however, is window resizing. Some older apps become unstable when you try to resize them on a laptop, because they were never meant to do anything but display on a phone or tablet.  To confront the window-resizing issue, Google’s baked several tools in its newest Chrome OS window manager. The system scans apps to see which “era” of Android they were built for. If the app is not density-aware, for example, the app will always display in a maximized window. Pre-Android N apps, meanwhile, will switch between a fullscreen view and a fixed window size. For Android N and later, most apps are freely resizable, thanks to the windowing features built into Android 7.1. That said, some apps may not use the resizable feature, in which case they would fill the screen. The impact on you at home Unfortunately, this still doesn’t answer the question of when all those older Chromebooks slated for Android support will get it. Currently there are just six Chrome OS devices that support Android apps in the stable channel. Two are in beta, and more than 80 are “planned” to get Android apps in the future, according to Google’s Chromium site. Hopefully, this will all be sorted out by the fall, but at this point there’s really no point in predicting when the great Android app revolution will happen on Chrome OS.

During the keynote, Google announced Actions on Google would help make Assistant a bit more useful, as it looks to compete against Amazon Alexa. Before I/O began, Google announced the new Google Assistant SDK, which will now allow developers to create Assistant devices. One such accessory was announced by Mobvoi, which is one of Google’s Chinese partners. You may have heard of Mobvoi before, as the company launched a new smartwatch on Kickstarter, the Mobvoi Ticwatch 2, which blew its goal out fo the water in just 10 minutes. However, later this Summer, Mobvoi announced the Tichome Mini which has a similar look to Amazon’s Echo Dot but will be powered by Google Assistant. The Tichome Mini features a puck design, but includes microphones and speakers, making it an extremely portable option to access Google Assistant in your home. Unfortunately, Mobvoi didn’t share any information regarding pricing or availability, so we’ll be keeping our ears to the ground as we await an official launch. Let us know what you think about the Tichome Mini and if you’ll be looking to get one once they are made available.

Name: Subject: Message: Google will learn if it will be charged in EU antitrust cases in a few months Newsby John Callaham16 hours ago 3 97 10 Google will learn very soon if it will be charged in the many antitrust cases that have been under investigation by the European Commission, the European Union body that oversees competition. See also: Here are the five best things that were announced at Google I/O 2017 3 days ago According to Reuters, Tommaso Valletti, the European Commission’s chief competition economist, stated in a conference today that the agency will announce its decision on all the Google cases “in the next few months.” If the Commission does decide that Google did violate its anti-trust laws, the company could be hit with large fines. The Commission actually has three separate antitrust probes into Google's business practices. The Commission actually has three separate antitrust probes into Google’s business practices. It first started investigating the company way back in 2010, with the Commission claiming that Google promoted its own shopping listings on its search results over its rivals. Google has tried to settle that particular case a number of times, but so far its efforts have not satisfied the Commission. In 2016, the Commission announced it was filing official charges against Google for anti-competitive behavior surrounding its Android operating system. The Commission claims Google has prevented competitors from offering rival search apps and other services on Android devices. While Google has denied those charges from the Commission, it recently settled with the country of Russia over similar antitrust complaints. Among other things, Google has agreed to not require hardware makers that apps like Maps, Gmail and others to be pre-installed on phones sold in Russia in order for those devices to gain access to the Google Play Store (they will still have the option to preinstall those apps, however). Later that year, the Commission said it was also looking into Google’s AdSense service, which provides the majority of Google’s revenue. It says it is investigating complaints from rivals that AdSense, combined with Google’s search engine, offer an unfair advantage when running ads on websites. Google has tried in the past to make the case that its business practices actually encourages competition, as well as provide more choices for European consumers. The Commission doesn’t seem to agree, and we won’t have to wait much longer to find out exactly what changes the agency will ask Google to make for Europe, along with any fines it will have to pay.

gizmodo Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root gizmodo The Best Apps for Hearing the News Before Anyone Else David NieldYesterday 8:44am Filed to: apps mobile news Android iOS 21 5 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink Image: Gizmodo You might have noticed we’re in a crazy news cycle right now, and in these times of political and civil uncertainty, staying on top of breaking news is more important than ever. If you want the most relevant stories delivered to your phone in the shortest possible time, we’ve got the apps for you. You can pick up news apps of all shapes and sizes for Android and iOS, but here we’ve tried to focus on the candidates that excel in one particular area: breaking news. That means push notifications that surface the stories most relevant to your interests, and delivered as fast as possible. The number of alerts you get varies depending on how you configure each app, but having carried these apps around for a couple of days, both AP Mobile and News360 are the most consistent for throwing up news stories that are just breaking, with the AP app best for local news stories (if you’ve set local news stories up). Advertisement Each of these apps has their merits though, so we’d recommend trying out a few to see which ones work best for your news taste. Nuzzel Image: Screenshots Nuzzel scans what your friends on Twitter and Facebook are sharing and uses that as an indicator of what news you might want to hear about. The app’s ability to filter news headlines based on their timeliness as well as their popularity on your social graph is handy. in general, Nuzzel doesn’t show alerts for as many stories as other apps, but when something big is breaking on Facebook or Twitter, it seems to do the best job at showing the news first. Indeed, the app’s breaking news alerts consistently impressed us with their speed and relevance. Additionally, you can customize the threshold used to trigger a breaking news alert as well as limit the number of push notifications you get a day in the app settings. Sponsored Nuzzel (free) for Android and iOS Google Now Image: Screenshots Google Now or the Google app or whatever you want to call the service (it varies based on who you ask and which platform you’re on) isn’t the most advanced news app in the world but it is smart. (One advantage of letting Google track you just about everywhere is that it does a good job of working out which news stories you’re going to want to read.) You can turn on push notifications for news (and traffic updates and the weather) from inside the app settings, and we’ve seen numerous timely headlines appear while we’ve been using the Google Now launcher that comes on stock Nexus phones. It’s less aggressive on iOS, but you can still configure push alerts on the news you want. Google (free) for Android and iOS Flipboard Image: Screenshots Everyone’s favorite mobile magazine maker is also useful for breaking news alerts too, and you can either tap into the shared knowledge of your social media feeds or rely on Flipboard to ping you regularly based on the topics of your choosing. The app was recently redesigned so flicking through your curated stories works more smoothly than ever. Advertisement You don’t get all that much control over which stories prompt alerts and how often they come through, but there’s an impressive level of customization when it comes to the topics that Flipboard pulls together for you, and a host of news sources to pore through. When you’re ready to read something, the interface is hard to beat.

The new organization’s app design won’t win any beauty contests, but when it comes to getting notifications relevant to your interests, the AP is killer. Advertisement AP Mobile doesn’t tap into your social feeds and doesn’t even require any kind of registration, so it’s a more straight-up take on the day’s news, sorted into the categories or the parts of the world you specify. Inside the app settings you can set up a ‘quiet time’ when you won’t be buzzed by whatever breaking news story is about to hit the headlines. AP Mobile (free) for Android and iOS News360 One of the more venerable news apps out there, News360 has been treading the beat for a while now, but still comes up with the goods if you’re after fresh, relevant news headlines pushed straight to your phone. It’s one of the best at sifting the genuinely important stories from the rest, and you can go pretty specific in terms of news topics. News alerts can be switched on or off for certain categories, if you want push notifications on tech news but not sports scores, and there is the option to link your Facebook and Twitter for a more personalized feed, though this isn’t essential. You can like or dislike stories you read too, which means News360 learns more about what you want over time.

The special reader mode for articles is friendly on the eyes too.

Google’s new website explains Syrian refugee crisis with 360 degree photos, satellite imagery, video & more Posted 16 hours ago by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story Ford names Jim Hackett CEO to take its connected car plans up a gear The charitable arm of Google and the UN have teamed up on a new website aimed at helping people better understand the Syrian refugee crisis through the combination of data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) along with satellite imagery, 360 degree photos and stills, videos, stories from refugees, and more. The new site, called “Searching for Syria,” presents this information to visitors in an accessible way – by providing simple but visually immersive answers to questions like “What is happening in Syria?” and even, “what is a refugee?” Google explained that it’s been able to gauge how much worldwide interest there is on the web from people using its search engine for answers to basic questions about the refugee situation in Syria. “What is happening in Syria?” was among the top trending searches in Germany, France and the U.K. last year, for example, and over tens of millions in 2016 searched for information on the Syria. The company, including its Google.org arm, partnered with the UNHCR to combine the organization’s annual Global Trends report – which contains facts and figures about refugees, asylum-seekers, migrants and others – with Google’s Search trend data. The idea is to offer web searchers better answers to their ongoing questions, but one that taps into more visual imagery to help paint a picture of the human side of the crisis, and the scale of the situation in the country of Syria. The site begins with a brief introduction, then takes you pages of questions about Syria, like “What was Syria like before the war?,” “What is going on in Syria?” “Where are Syrian refugees going?” and others. Questions are answered with short text blurbs relying factual answers and statistics, which are combined with full-screen photos, some of which can be turned 360 degrees for a more immersive viewing of a given place or scene. For example, one section of the website lets you visit half a dozen UNESCO world heritage sites in 360 degrees, including the ancient cities of Aleppo, Bosra, and Damascus, the ancient villages of Northern Syria, Crac des Chevaliers and Qal’at Salah El-Din and the site of Palmyra. After panning through the beautiful imagery, you scroll down to the next slide and learn that the war in Syria has damaged or destroyed them all. Visualization in the form of charts and graphs are also sometimes present, along with personal stories from refugees and videos from YouTube. There are only five questions on the site, but scrolling through all their components takes some time. In reading through and watching the material, visitors are meant to understand the true human toll the war has taken on Syrian lives. The site also encourages visitors to learn how they can help – by signing the UNHCR’s petition to pledge your support that you stand #WithRefugees, making a donation, or just sharing the website to raise awareness. Though largely an educational experience, there’s of course a political undertone to Google’s investment in this resource. The U.S. and some other countries have pushed back against allowing Syrian refugees to cross their borders. This includes Trump’s hardline stance on Syria in general in which the president has proposed cuts to foreign aid, including the U.N. and agencies helping refugees. He has also tried to stop Syrian refugees from entering the country twice – moves that were blocked by courts. Meanwhile, on Sunday, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. – seemingly ignoring Trump’s proposed budget – has pledged increased support from the U.S. for the refugees. This is not Google.org’s first time addressing the crisis – it has already invested more than $20 million in grants supporting solutions to provide over 800,000 refugees with emergency support and access to critical information and education, the company says. The new site is available here. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Google Founded 1998 Overview Google is a multinational corporation that is specialized in internet-related services and products.

Both Google and Amazon have surged ahead with the Google Assistant and Alexa landing in UK homes encased in gadgets known as 'smart speakers'. This new category of home automation lets you set timers, play music and even control other devices - just by yelling at them. But the success of Google Home and Amazon Echo has left Apple trailing in third place with just its popular iPhones and iPads listening out for commands. Read More Apple's 'next big thing' could be a Siri-powered smart speaker to take on Amazon Echo and Google Home Amazon Alexa, Echo and the All-New Echo Dot However, internet rumours are swirling that Tim Cook & Co have plans to join the fray with a new Siri-powered smart speaker. Here's what we know about it so far. Latest news According to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has a track record of leaking accurate information on Apple products, there is an "over 50% chance" the new speaker will be unveiled at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) next month. The annual event, which Apple usually uses to introduce new software features to developers, is scheduled for June 5-9 . Read More WWDC 2017: Siri speaker to be unveiled alongside iOS 11 and macOS 10.13 at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference Apple's Tim Cook holds up Brandon Moss' 100th career home run during the keynote speech at the Worldwide Developers Conference (Photo: TNS /Landov / Barcroft Media) Kuo added that the device will most likely start selling in the second half of 2017, in order to compete with the new Amazon Echo models expected to launch around that time. "We expect Apple's first home AI product will have excellent acoustics performance (one woofer + seven tweeters) and computing power (similar to iPhone 6/6S AP)," Kuo said in a research note obtained by MacRumors . Release date If analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is to be believed, then Apple could make its new product available in the second half of 2017. Apple has a long history of revealing its new iPhone models in September and launching them either straight away or in October. If the company is building a smart speaker, it may decide to combine distribution costs and launch it alongside the forthcoming iPhone 8 . Price Apple's pricing is likely to be influenced slightly by the £129 Google Home and £149 Amazon Echo . Current rumours suggest Apple's speaker will be priced higher than Amazon's in an effort to reach the premium end of the market. PC Advisor pegs the cost at potentially around £200. Read More Google’s virtual butler will obey your commands, from turning on music to ordering flowers Apple Music is Apple's music service which it could use with a smart speaker Interestingly, Apple-focused site 9to5Mac predicted back in January that Apple's speaker could come in at only $100. That would make it around £75 here in the UK - a price point that would immediately make it more attractive than its rivals. Design The clearest evidence yet that Apple is building a smart speaker comes from a patent that was granted on May 16, 2017. It describes a cylindrical new gadget with "radially deployed components" that could include lamps, displays, speakers, microphones or a range of different sensors. Another prolific Apple leaker, Sonny Dickson, has tweeted that the new speaker could be similar in appearance to a Mac Pro. Read More We're Siri-ous: Google launches it's voice-controlled Assistant on your iPhone (Photo: USPTO) He said it will have a concave top, built-in controls, and speaker meshing covering the majority of its surface. The device will run a variation of iOS, according to Dickson, and feature technology from its Beats range of audio equipment. Beats already makes a portable speaker called the Beats Pill, which pairs with a smartphone, tablet or computer over Bluetooth and boasts 12-hour battery life. Several design sketches were included with the patent application and could give an idea of what the speaker may look like. Features Industry watchers believe Apple's speaker will run a modified version of iOS with Siri as the interface. It will therefore be able to perform all the actions that Siri can currently do, including answering questions, playing music, reading the news, setting timers and controlling special connected devices. Read More Google I/O 2017 keynote LIVE: Tech giant to announce updates to Android, Home and Daydream at annual developer conference (Photo: Amazon) Apple will likely include its AirPlay technology - which means the streaming would be particularly stable. It could also allow users to access other Apple services like iTunes and Beats radio. Of particular interest is whether Apple would include a screen similar to the Amazon Echo Show . That would enable people to use FaceTime video chat from the same device. Ming Chi Kuo has stated there will be a touch "panel" on the front of the device, but stopped short of saying Apple will include a full touchscreen. When will we know more? With Apple's Worldwide Developer's Conference mere weeks away, it might not be long before we know more about this mysterious device. If the company doesn't reveal its finished product at the programmer-focused event, then it may well drop a few carefully placed hints instead. We'll keep this article updated with the latest news on Apple's rumoured Siri smart speaker.

Only 5 per cent of the tech giant's staff are black or Hispanic Reuters/Beck Diefenbach Any advocate of diversity in business has excuses to despair galore these days. White, predominately privately educated men run corporate Britain. The gender pay gap is doggedly stuck in double digits and, as of late last year, more than half of FTSE 100 companies did not have any directors of colour. Only nine BME executives held the position of chair or chief executive. Elsewhere it’s still not unusual for professionals of any seniority level to hide their sexual orientation, fearful that it might sway their image or potential in the workplace. Case in point: it took until 2014 for Britain to have its first openly gay CEO of a FTSE 100 company, courtesy of Burberry’s Christopher Bailey.  Especially in London, we have a tendency to pinpoint the finance industry as the worst offender when it comes to attracting talent of all genders, skin colours, religions and beliefs. And why wouldn’t we? The Oxbridge-educated bankers and investors, with their double-barrelled surnames and corner offices in Canary Wharf’s ivory towers, are an easy target for our grievances. But as the tech industry continues to balloon, enticing graduates with golden handshakes, free food, yoga breaks, exotic “off-sites” and the opportunity to help save the world one driverless car at a time, we need to reassess the targets of our frustrations.  Head of Google HR explains what helps them retain their best employees By most measures, at least half of the world’s 10 biggest companies are tech firms and, at the explosive rate at which they’re swelling, it’s only a matter of time before the tech world dictates the culture of global business. Perhaps it already does. A recent survey of more than 60,000 UK university students awarded Google the title of most popular graduate employer. Tech peers Microsoft and Amazon cruised into the top 10 too, pushing the highest placed banks, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, into 12th and 20th place respectively. A separate study showed this month that JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs were the fourth and fifth most attractive employers in the UK for business and engineering students – but Google and Apple triumphed in first and second spot.  Understandably, an office full of bean bags and resident pooches may seem more appealing than working under the staid auspices of Wall Street luminaries, but if role models really are a magnet for new talent, then we may be degenerating at a petrifying pace when it comes to progress towards stamping out archaic homogeneity. The most recently available data shows men account for 69 per cent of Google’s workforce, 59 per cent are white and a measly 5 per cent are black or Hispanic. If you think that’s poor, then take a look at the company’s tech teams, where the male contingent shoots up to 81 per cent, with just 4 per cent black or Hispanic. Men hold 76 per cent of leadership positions, and blacks and Hispanics just 3 per cent. Asians hold 25 per cent. Read more If you think Theresa May can't speak for women, you've given up The picture is similar at Facebook. As of July last year, the company’s representation in senior leadership was 6 per cent Black and Hispanic and 27 per cent women, mirroring Apple where the figures came in at 10 per cent and 28 per cent respectively. In other words, Silicon Valley is dominated by tech bros. Progress of any scale in the tech industry is of course commendable, especially when companies commit to concrete goals and very public campaigns: cloud computing behemoth Salesforce has appointed a chief equality officer, who reports directly to the CEO. The company runs at least a dozen resource groups promoting a diverse and inclusive working culture, and commits to interviewing at least one female candidate or underrepresented minority for every executive position. But that’s far from the norm. As the pace of hiring hastens, as companies surpass new valuation benchmarks and gobble up the smartest graduates who are the most likely to be able to change the outdated make-up of our corporate culture, full marks for effort may be praiseworthy but far from good enough. Of course most other industries – not least banking and finance – still have a mountain of progress to scale. But in the world of tech, where a “CE Bro” culture rules, the threat of being bulldozed by an army of white, male coders and programmers, who know everything about you (thanks to their command over the Internet of Things) is perhaps more real because it’s less obvious.  Jeremy Corbyn ambushes Theresa May during Facebook Live event with TV debate challenge Tech companies may generally be seen as progressive, future-focused, inclusive, open-minded and liberal. But the vicious sexism row that’s engulfed Uber offers just a small, deeply terrifying peek into a dark world. Until now we might have considered a well-tailored suit and tie, member-club cufflinks and an expensive watch to be the uniform most emblematic of a homogenous workforce, but beware of the hoodie and trainers. Those who don them are proving that they can pack a powerful punch when it comes to cultural progress. And although they’re doing a good job, we’re going to need more than Sheryl Sandberg or Arianna Huffington to save us.

How Google plans to tackle power consumption even more aggressively in Android Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 5:29pm PDTMay 18, 2017 15 Plus 1 on G+ 99 Share on Facebook 58 Share on Twitter Total Shares172 Android OS Development Google News Videos Yesterday at I/O Google had an interesting talk called Background Check and Other Insights into the Android Operating System Framework. It's a long name, but really it's about improving battery life in Android. It went on at great length as to how, exactly, they plan on doing that, and it's quite worth a watch. We have the video here, but if you don't have the half-hour to check it out, then you are welcome to read below. The central methodology Google is using to try to improve things is the idea of visibility. When something is running in the background and doing a ton of stuff like calling your location at quick intervals, it results in battery drain. So now Google wants to change how things happen in the background, by ensuring that free-running background services aren't sucking your battery dry. Background apps will be pushed out of memory when they leave the foreground, and requests for things like location or WiFi happening in the background will only occasionally see new information from Android. Applications that would otherwise receive broadcasts also might not wake up unless they are given an explicit call to do so in the broadcast, although there are some exceptions. Apps can still get around this by being foregrounded in some way, but now that will be something visible that the user is aware of. This focus on visibility for apps will also mean developers will have to make decisions about what is really better to the user. If doing an ongoing notification as a means of bypassing the stuff above would confuse a user, is that really the right thing for them to do in that case? Other tools can be used to schedule your tasks ahead of time or to wait for events like the job intent service that developers can use in both pre and post-O environments. Jobs and alarms also allow the OS to defer. So, if something happens that would trigger a bunch of other apps to wake up, like a new picture being taken, that can be passed to those apps one at a time after a delay. That way the user doesn't suddenly have a ton of performance issues and drain out of nowhere. Basically, Google wants to solve some of the problems with battery life by defining bad behaviors for developers, like persistent background services or accidental leaks to the background of typically foregrounded activities, and make it clear that things have to be done the right way going forward or their stuff won't work. But it's also giving them new tools and choices for how to best accomplish the things they need to do. The new features in the Play Console and in Android Studio should also help developers be aware of when they are making these mistakes so that they can be fixed. It's a matter of visibility for the developers as well as visibility for the users. To paraphrase Steve Balmer: Visibility, visibility, visibility. A significant user-facing change of this visibility mindset is a new battery menu in O, with a focus on actionable interaction. Instead of just seeing stuff like Screen and Google Play Services next to a number that they won't understand, now users will be given ways of interacting with that data if they don't like it, and can better see how they are using applications without needing to do a bunch of mental calculations. So, when a user has a problem with their expectations of battery performance and goes looking to see what might be causing it, they are more likely to find what caused it, understand what it means, and take action about it. All of these changes are is in pursuit of Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life. Right now the tools in software aren't all there, but these are steps that can take us in that direction.

Good feature to take from iOS Knowledgeborn Allah This does seem similar to what Apple implemented in iOS, but I'm curious about how this will impact RAM management. If it reduces the cache file too much, it'll just close the application completely, and you'll have to start over every time you want to use the app again. Apple somehow found a way around this problem, even in devices with less RAM, but I'm not too sure how Google will accomplish this. Even "doze" on my Pixel XL kills apps in the background all the time. This new thing sounds it could potentially make the problem worse. Justin Osborne Well I sure can tell a difference since upgrading, that's for sure. The new battery section makes me feel a lot better about how the battery is looking. But that's where it ends. Today, I got a full hour less out of my battery than normal. 2 hours vs 3-3.5 on the Pixel. That said, it's a beta, so I'm not complaining. It's definitely not the direction I want to go tho (nor are these new emoticons, sigh). marcusmarcus2 "Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life." I'm glad, but can we get a two pronged attack to address this. Yes, Google needs to keep improving the software side, but OEMs need to help out and quit making thinner phones. They are thin enough, give us more battery capacity. AbdulB1 actually they save quite a lot by putting small batteries in the phones instead of big ones. Krzysztof Jozwik I'm not sure you read OP's comment. Nothing was said about saving... AbdulB1 smaller capacity battery is much cheaper marcusmarcus2 My original comment was not about savings, cheapness, cost, etc. Jack Jennings You've said the same thing twice for no reason. Krzysztof Jozwik I wouldn't say "much" I'm no expert on the matter, but last I checked replacement batteries aren't that expensive, and I don't have the buying power of an oem AbdulB1 Most phones today dont have replacement batteries, they have unremovable ones. OEM or no OEM a 3000mAh battery will always be cheaper than 4000mAh one. marcusmarcus2 I can find batteries for my different Moto G phones that have "Non-User replaceable batteries" for nearly the same price as my LG phones that have user replaceable batteries online. Most likely the OEMs can get them for about the same as well so replaceable or not really does not matter. Either way, yes a 3000mAh battery will be cheaper than a 4000mAh one for OEMs, but probably not much at all, especially at the volume they would by at. I'm guessing they are choosing smaller batteries to make their phones thinner and not because it is slightly cheaper for them. Thinness is better to advertise to most consumers as most consumers are drawn to looks over functionality now a days. I still prefer function over looks for my devices. Krzysztof Jozwik And non replaceable will always be cheaper than replaceable. The point is, the batteries aren't the bulk of the cost. Geoff Johnson What the hell is your point? He never said anything about cost, he was just talking about stop making phones thinner for design and aesthetic reasons. james fuston The idea that smaller and thinner phones result in less battery life is a bit of a misnomer. For an example, I'd refer you to the iPhone SE. marcusmarcus2 I never said smaller and thinner. I just said thinner. They could make some of the phones the same height and width as the current one but make it a little thicker to give a thicker battery, and that would help with the battery life. james fuston Okay, but your general sentiment is still that battery life is tied directly to physical size which, again stating my example of the iPhone SE, isn't the case. The power draw of the components is far more important than the physical size of the phone. marcusmarcus2 My general sentiment is ONLY in regards to thickness of the phone. My sentiment is not to width or height, which also make up the size of the phone. The width and height is usually determined more by the screen where thickness is more often do to battery. A larger screen (component) will draw more power than a smaller screen, I agree with you there. But you seem to think the size of the battery does not make a difference, please correct me if I am wrong. Using your example of iPhone SE, if they would have made that a little thicker than it is now by making the battery larger, that would have made the battery life even longer than it already is. That is my point. james fuston > A larger screen (component) will draw more power than a smaller screen, I agree with you there. Let me give this one more shot. "your general sentiment is still that battery life is tied directly to physical size which, again stating my example of the iPhone SE, isn't the case" To break out the pieces, battery life is tied...to physical size...which, again...isn't the case. In other words, we do not agree. The iPhone SE is the exact same size as the iPhone 5S and it gets 30%+ better battery life purely through efficiency in components. To say high mAh results in long battery life is a misnomer that the G6 or V20 should be a clear reminder of. You also cannot equate physical size to battery capacity as energy density is not a universal measurement. marcusmarcus2 You are comparing different phones with different components. I agree with you that component efficiency has an effect on battery life. But... Let me give you one more shot. We will use your iPhone SE for this. If there were 2 versions of the SE. Both have the exact same components except one has a battery that is 1000 mAh larger than the other (thus making it slightly thicker), than the one with the larger battery would have more battery life, Thus the thicker one would have better battery life. That is what I am saying. I'm not comparing large phones to small phones. I'm saying if they had a larger battery in a phone with the exact same specs/components then the battery life would be better. That is all my point was. Do you not agree with that? EDIT: Yes, size of the battery may not increase with capacity due to density, but it usually will increase in size as it does increase in capacity, especially if it increases a lot. Geoff Johnson Again, you're talking about it being smaller. The iPhone SE gets good battery life because it has a 4" screen. The complaint is that phones are getting THINNER. Meaning that they still have 5.5-6" displays, but are thinner and translate to smaller batteries. james fuston Nope, not at all. The cell in the SE is about 50mAh bigger than the 5S (which is the exact same size). The 30%+ battery life improvement comes from more efficient components, not just their size. marcusmarcus2 Technically it is 2 dimensional train of thought. Also, if they increased it horizontally or vertically, then they would most likely have to increase the dimensions of the phone horizontally or vertically, thus changing the size of the screen or bezel. Increasing it thickness wise means they would not have to change the look of the of the front of the phone. Anywho, I'm only talking about thickness, not height, width, different components, different phones, not small phones or big phones. I'm talking just battery capacity, if all other components remain the same. Thickening the battery would add battery capacity without changing the over all look much at all. It could be any phone of your choosing. If adding a thicker/higher capacity battery to whatever 1 phone you want, that phone would have a longer battery life. Do you not agree with that logic? james fuston Thickness is commonly referred to as "depth" otherwise known as the Z-axis. That's one dimension. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8cba520372d511803190227fe949a5d698a79509804cb6ec7f8f2afbe25323c3.gif marcusmarcus2 you are right, that is 1 dimensional thinking. I read it wrong. And you are right I miss the joke as I do not see what is funny. I'm glad you know that thickness is depth, but when referring to phones, depth is commonly referred to as thickness. Anyways, You are the one that is applying 3 dimensional thinking when my general sentiment was only referring to 1 dimension, thus you pretty much accused me of referring it to all dimensions, when I was not. Now you are complaining I'm only applying it to 1 dimension. Which is it? https://68.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmbq2nuTrp1qcr8tuo1_500.gif In all seriousness though. I AM only referring to 1 dimension, thickness or depth (whichever you want to go by). Then they can fit a thicker battery in to increase its capacity without having to get a higher cost denser battery and without changing the over all look of the phone. Compare that to getting a battery that is larger in height and/or width, that phone would need to be designed with either a larger bezel (which would most likely make the phone look bad) or use a larger screen (which would most likely be less power efficient which would negate some of the extra battery capacity). james fuston > you are right I miss the joke as I do not see what is funny. Missing the joke and not seeing the joke as funny are two different things, but the joke wasn't really meant for you either way. > I'm glad you know that thickness is depth, but when referring to phones, depth is commonly referred to as thickness Yes, this is referred to as a "synonym" in the English language. > You are the one that is applying 3 dimensional thinking when my general sentiment was only referring to 1 dimension, thus you pretty much accused me of referring it to all dimensions I'm not sure you understand how to use "thus." To recap; you said the way to make battery life longer was to make phones thicker. I said you shouldn't conflate (that means mistakenly associate) thickness with battery life, as the physical size of a battery can also be increased with an adjustment in width or height of a phone. Not sure how you got me "[accusing you] of referring it to all dimensions" out of that. I can tell now that your argument originates from the fact that you don't like bezels and aren't crazy about large screens, but also want longer battery life. The reality here is that the majority of people disagree with you and would care significantly if their next phone was substantially thicker than their current phone, largely due to the fact that increased thickness makes curved-edged or "bezel less" phones significantly harder to hold. marcusmarcus2 >Yes, this is referred to as a "synonym" in the English language. Yes, we both agree on the fact it means the same. I just wasn't sure why you pointed out it is the same as depth when that seems to have been obvious to both of us. Maybe I did not use 'thus' correctly, but I'm sure you know what I meant and just don't want to address it. >To recap; you said the way to make battery life longer was to make phones thicker. I said you shouldn't conflate (that means mistakenly associate) thickness with battery life, as the physical size of a battery can also be increased with an adjustment in width or height of a phone. Not sure how you got me "[accusing you] of referring it to all dimensions" out of that. How do you not get you, you just repeated it? I was only referring to 1 dimension and you are trying to apply more dimensions to, which would change the over all look of the phone which would make people that like that phone not want that phone any more, whatever the phone was to begin with. Also, your recap is incorrect. I just said phones should be thicker for better battery life, meaning the thickness should come because of a thicker battery. Your response was address "smaller AND thinner phones" meaning you were applying other dimensions to the thickness which would make it a different phone with most likely different parts. >I can tell now that your argument originates from the fact that you don't like bezels and aren't crazy about large screens Half right and half wrong. I don't like bezels. I do like large screens though. I'm not referring to big phones or small phones. I'm refering to and phone compared to itself but thicker. You are the one comparing different size (width and height) phones. My point is you don't have to change the look of whatever phone you like if you just increase the thickness, whether that phone is large or small. >The reality here is that the majority of people disagree with you You sure about that? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/013a3bd18bb4ffc1eba1ece1d07e1fe9b6aeb2639380ca6c9fe00b40e043e452.png When a company releases 2 choices of the same phone with only the thickness/battery being different (same screen size, storage, RAM, processor, etc.) then we can see if people really do feel about thickness over battery life) Sk0ly You can't compare between OSs. There is a reason Android uses more battery, it features true multitasking and doesn't drastically limit background processes like iOS. Looks like Google is going a bit to the Apple approach going forward as devs can't be counted on to write decent code. james fuston Seeing as we're talking about physical dimensions and hardware specifications and they're effect on power draw, you absolutely can compare between operating systems. Processors aren't suddenly able to use more power than they're designed to use just because you've installed a different operating system. Jason B "Processors aren't suddenly able to use more power than they're designed to use just because you've installed a different operating system." Just to jump in: sure, they won't use more than their design power, but they can be used very inefficiently depending on OS. All modern mobile SoCs have hardware clock and power gating, but if software isn't allowing the SoC to idle properly or needs to use more CPU/GPU cycles to complete tasks versus other OS, yes, you will use more power as the clocks+voltage jump around instead of going into SoC's proper sleep mode for former or will hold onto higher clocks longer for latter. Apple makes both its hardware and software, so if you think that has no net effect, well ... Sk0ly Except the OS's operate in a completely different manner. Androids advantage being background functionality and iOS advantage being battery life. marcusmarcus2 What's this "We" stuff? You are talking about physical dimensionS and hardware specificationS. I'm talking about A physical dimension and the only hardware specification I'm talking about is the capacity of the battery resulting from it being thicker. You don't like @Sk0ly:disqus comparing different OS's when OS's have nothing to do with the point you are making? That's funny because you are doing the same thing to me, comparing different size (height and width) phones with different specs when that has nothing to do with the point I am making. marcusmarcus2 To be fair, @j_fuze:disqus was not comparing between OSs. He was comparing between different iOS devices. Specifically iPhone SE and iPhone 5S. You have to read a few of his comments to see what he was comparing. Either way, he missed my point by comparing different phones with different specs. My point was if ALL things being the same between 2 phones, except one had a thicker/larger capacity battery, that would give that thicker phone more battery life. I'm not sure why James is so hell bent on comparing different size phones with different specs/components. james fuston > James is so hell bent on comparing different size phones with different specs/components. lol, because I'm not interested in comparing different colors of the same phone? I didn't realize we were comparing battery life of hypothetical devices. marcusmarcus2 Colors? What are talking about now? Seriously, focus. >I didn't realize we were comparing battery life of hypothetical devices. I'm glad you started to finally read then and figured it out. Unfortunately, they will stay hypothetical until companies come out with devices with bigger batteries. james fuston Yes, colors. What other difference could there possibly be if the dimensions and specs of the phone are the same? You're 0/3 on understanding a point presented by someone else now. marcusmarcus2 >You're 0/3 on understanding a point presented by someone else now. haha. Lets address this part first because it is too funny. Not only can you not focus, you are delusional. You are the one who cannot get a point and you try to say I don't get a point. You are hilarious. I'm the OP of this thread of comments, you replied to me initially and you failed to understand the point. You have since replied numerous other times and have failed again and again to understand the point, each time bringing up different aspects of a phone that had nothing to do with my initial point. I get your points, but they have nothing to do with what my point is initially. Just because you can't understand that does not mean I don't get your point. >Yes, colors. What other difference could there possibly be if the dimensions and specs of the phone are the same Hmm. This is a tough one. Maybe battery capacity and additional thickness dues to extra battery capacity, you know, like I have said since the bigining and in every other comment since then. No other dimension and spec other than those, like I said each time. Talk about not understanding a point, you are the king of missing the point. https://media.giphy.com/media/14r9VMLSuQUzQs/giphy.gif Lets try to make this easy for you. Try to answer the following. I'll give you a little help by giving you the answers seeing as you have trouble catching the point of this original comment thread. Would a larger capacity battery give a phone more battery life compared to a smaller capacity battery, considering that is the only difference? Yes. Would increasing the thickness of a battery give it more capacity, considering that is the only difference? Yes. Would a thicker battery result in a thicker phone, considering that is the only difference? Yes. Are there other ways of increasing battery life? (This was not part of my original point, but since you keep adding it then I'll address it) Of course, like more optimized software or more efficient parts. Would including a larger capacity battery along with optimizing the software and more efficient parts give more battery life than optimized software and more efficient parts alone? Of course they would. Do more efficient parts have anything to do with your point you are trying to make? No What about color? Again, nothing to do with my point. What about box the phone comes in? No, but I thought I'd through that in there as a guess what James might try and distract with next. Do you get my point yet? My point is a larger capacity battery through making battery and the phone thicker would make any phone have more battery life. I really hope you get the point this time as you seem to be the only one who can't comprehend this. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/013a3bd18bb4ffc1eba1ece1d07e1fe9b6aeb2639380ca6c9fe00b40e043e452.png james fuston > Of course, like more optimized software or more efficient parts. Hey look! After another 5 paragraphs he comes around to the same conclusion as the "delusional" guy. I'm looking forward to reading the next essay, keep em coming. Oh and keep posting screenshots of the up/downvotes you've enabled, it's highly entertaining. marcusmarcus2 Not picking out only parts of my response and ignoring what you don't want to address. I have not come to the same conclusion as you. Like I said I got your point about more efficient parts. But like I said, that has nothing to do with the point I was making. I won't explain it again, I've done so enough and if you don't get it by now, then you are either a special kind of stupid, smart but to suborn to admit your wrong, or a troll who successfully trolled me. I'm done reading your lack of intelligent responses. I'll let Bobby finish talking to you because I am done. http://pa1.narvii.com/5800/e40bec66da3b149914b3323a0a2d5e07bc96bce2_hq.gif https://m.popkey.co/765dfc/Re7oQ.gif JD The SE wasn't thinner. Ryne Hager Give me a OnePlus with 5000mAh and I would be so happy. someone755 Give me a 4.7" phone like the og Moto X and I would be so happy. Neither of us are going to be happy, Ryne. Drakenoid OG Moto X updated for current year would be perfect for me. Vlad I never broke a single headphone since I first had a smartphone in 2011 until I got a 5" phone. Since then, I need to buy new ones if I use one daily for more than 2 weeks, simply because sitting or walking up on stairs will break the cable thanks to the length of the phone. Upsides: 5" phone with 4100 mAh battery => amazing. And it's also thin as heck. Downsides: breaks headphones, bends, need to root for decent software (Xiaomi). Gimme back my 4.5" 720p screen, Motorola. Kristian Ivanov I highly agree on the thin phones part. Bought a Huawei P10 2 days ago, for me, that thing is unusable without a case to make it a bit fatter. Karly Johnston If they fix idle battery drain that doesn't become an issue. marcusmarcus2 I'm not saying they should not fix battery drain. I'm saying if they fix battery drain AND add higher capacity battery (making phone a little thicker), they could increase battery life even more than just addressing one of them. So if fixing the battery drain adds another day and a thicker battery adds another day, you'd go from 1 day to 3 days instead of just 2 days from only fixing battery drain. Karly Johnston The battery life the current 625 phones are getting is where flagships need to be. That should be enough for anyone. marcusmarcus2 Everyone is not all the same. It may be enough for you. I'm saying, phones are beyond thin enough and could be thicker to increase battery life even more beyond what a 625 phone can do. Now, this is my opinion in regards to how I would like to use a phone. You are welcome to your own opinion. I'm not going to say what should be enough for anyone other than me. Karly Johnston The OEMs don't think that is what the vast majority of people need or want. Their target is a full day of battery life which is what most people are worried about. It isn't my opinion, it is the industry opinion of what the marketing priorities are. X-47B My phone has 4000 mAh battery, and it's 5.5-inch display. I easily get 2 days of battery even after heavy usage. Margaritas Ante Porcos Installed O on my 6p and battery still drains like a whore in a bukkake twelvesome. Google really can't do nothing at this point. Android is breaking to pieces. So many things needed to be fixed in O but instead Android's got even worse. That notification empty desert area of white grey nothingness kills me the most. Hate it really bad. The last Android I liked was 6th. catalysto Not sure what you're talking about. Battery life on my 6P with the new O is great. Maybe you have an aging battery? Margaritas Ante Porcos as long as your 6p works great, nothing else matters, right? Roy That's right. catalysto Just saying. My anecdotal evidence is as good as yours. And having poor battery life across multiple OS versions is a pretty strong indicator for a bad battery, don't ya think? In fact, I had the same problem with a previous 6P. iFeign Complain some more about your beta software Margaritas Ante Porcos It started with 7.1.2. Do you really need to be a btch when bad things happen to others? Roy For me everything goes smooth on my 6P on 7.1.2. so I need to complain that Android to good. The Wrath of Kahn If your 6P has shut down even once before reaching about 5% then you most likely have one of the defective batteries. I had to have mine replaced, but after that, it runs all day like a charm. ODP2 improved it, if anything. Margaritas Ante Porcos it was fine for a long time until I updated to 7.1.2. That update screwed the battery that was working superb all the time. DANA Try to do a factory reset, it fixes many problem for some user. Margaritas Ante Porcos It was one of the first things I did. Twice. Did not help. Paul_Werner Yeah you got to call Google (if you got yours from the Play Store). They've been replacing 6Ps with factory refurbished ones even out of warranty (source: it happened to me) Matthew Skalecki The update didn't screw up your battery. The battery was going to crap out on you regardless of which Android version you had. This happened to many people including me. Replacing the battery fixes the issue; reverting to a previous os does nothing. Zach Mauch Did you go through Google or a local shop? The Wrath of Kahn Unfortunately it was out of warranty, had a friend with the skills do it for me. JD I need more of this colorful imagery to describe simple everyday problems. mchalakov First off you are using a beta OS don't complain. Second thing is that battery drain comes mostly from the (bad)apps - if you watched the video or read the article you could understand. Third - I'm pretty sure you can go back to Marshmallow if you are so so so unhappy with Nougat or O. Jakst Really? Yesterday was my first day with Android O. I plugged my phone out at 7, and come home at midnight with 35 % battery left. I've never had that kind of battery life in my 6P before. So I've seen huge gains with this O preview. thereasoner The Android O beta I'm using is so slow to charge my Pixel today that it seems like that's what they tackled​....and not in a good way. iFeign Surprise, surprise, you're running BETA software. Smh. thereasoner Yeah I know and I'm sure it will get fixed between now and September. I'm just saying that the current difference in charge time is quite noticable at this point. AbdulB1 maybe they removed quick charge support in beta mattcoz Pixel never had quick charge. AbdulB1 hmm interesting. I thought it has qualcomm processor so it must have qc 3.0 too. Must be some proprietary stuff or qualcomm must be asking for more money to enable it. mattcoz Google is pushing the open USB-C power delivery standard. AbdulB1 Display screen eats up most of my battery. I can't see what google is doing will fix it somehow. We need different types of screens now. iFeign Uhh, it's as if you expect things to use NO battery at all. Infinite battery life! Of course using the screen, aka, using the phone, is going to be the largest proportionate power drain - no matter how fancy the screen tech. AbdulB1 battery tech has still not improved and nor did the screen tech. I can accept that the screen tech will remain same for a long time but as far as batteries are concerned they can be improved , made for longer number of recharge cycles but that hasn't caught up with the manufacturers yet. One thing which can be done is increasing the battery capacity but we all know this is not happening as phone manufactures think it will make phones bulky , add weight and in long term affect the sale of newer devices. Latheryin Multi day battery life will not happen until new battery tech comes around. With people needlessly having screen on times of 5+ hours there is no way to keep a battery charged for extended periods. Krzysztof Jozwik I average 2 hours of screen on time a day. Just because some use their phone 24/7 doesn't mean we all do. I have a job where I'm not on my phone, at home I have better screens to get info from. The phone is there when I need it. Your nonstop use case is not the norm. Latheryin As do I but that is not the norm. Might want to look at any forum about battery life and looking at screen on times. Most want and use 5+ hours. It's mainly the older generation like us that doesn't need it and are not on the device all the time. Krzysztof Jozwik Obviously the forums about battery life have people winning that they want 48 hours of screen on. That is not the norm. Sure, lots of people want that, most do not. Latheryin Most want more screen on time. Why do you think battery life is such an issue. disqusdeeznuts My Moto Z Play begs to differ. Motorola does it right with this phone. It has a good size battery (3510), an efficient processor, and runs smooth. It can be done, but for some reason, it just isn't a focus for a majority of manufacturers. Latheryin Well sure all the devices with that mid range chip and battery combo can get ok battery life. I could easily. Get 2 days out of my device and it only has a 3200 battery. It is not the oem. It's people. They need to spend less time look at their phone and more time living life. Which many are unprepared for. Cakefish I'm going the leaked Moto X4 continues that legacy onwards! Rod Ever heard of the Moto z Play, or Lenovo P2? Latheryin As already stated on that. The moto has a mid tear chip. As for the Lenovo, nope. Can't say I have, it's either not sold in my country or a mid low tier device that I wouldn't have noticed. Just looked. They both use the same mid tier chip. Also that does have a good battery. But that like the K1000 with a 10000 battery are the exception and seldom are they flagship quality. WarpspeedScp The Moto z does not have an SD 820 on it. Neither does the P2. It's very annoying that manufacturers can't give us something functional instead of eye-candy for once. Rod While it's not top of line sillicon, real world testes have proven that, for everyday tasks, there's virtually no difference between the S625 ans 821 WarpspeedScp Well, my phone has an SD 650, and dolphin emulator just about keeps up (wind waker and super smash Bros). On an 820, there would definitely be better results. Paul Troy I have a better idea. Get the hardware manufacturers to put a bigger battery in their devices. 💡 Taedirk If we could convince hardware manufacturers to do something useful, we wouldn't be on yet another revision to how Android updates the OS. Alex Yeah so this way the horrible wakelocks (that Android makes almost impossible to manage) will be less visible. Cakefish Why not both? Zach Mauch All I want to know is can they stop wakelocks. JD Same bullshit every year. I'll believe it when I see it. Unless Android O somehow allows me to download more mAh. Morten Ulv Are you trying to say Android battery life hasn't improved VASTLY over the years? JD Yep in fact it's regressed Morten Ulv I have no such issues. Better battery all across the board. JD What ever you're smoking pass that shit around Morten Ulv Your shit must be stronger than mine. browngeek I miss the days of my Xperia Z3 Lollipop and Stamina mode. Used to get 48 hours and 5-6 hours SOT. D13H4RD2L1V3 I hope this actually does something when the final build is out. I'm getting tired of hearing of every new battery improvement in a new version of Android only to have a wakelock pretty much make all of that moot. Dennis Ulijn I am on the Android O beta, and i must say that the information i get from it it really useful! I never could find the wakelocks because i'm not rooted, but now i can easily see what apps use up battery in the background. Awake meditation app was in use for 15 minutes (meditation) and active in the background for 1 hour (basically, ever since the meditation)! "Restrict background usage" to on, and we'll see what it brings tomorrow. PI this is interesting .... :) ,, Whats the current update Dennis Ulijn I'm in Europe so I just woke up. I'll let you know end of the day. Dennis Ulijn k. End of the day here. The apps (pocketcasts and aware) behaved nicely now. at 23%, which is not that great with 2 hours of screen on time and 32% and 5%of the battery used up by system and services respectively. (apps 32%, system 32%, services 5%, Cell standby 3%, idle 2%, bluetooth and wifi 0%) PI System 32% ,,, ???? Dennis Ulijn Yeah, last weeks i had the bug where system was using a lot of battery... I don't care right now, because i'm not expecting good battery life while on a beta. I did find a fix for system battery usage on Reddit though, which is to reset app preferences (which mostly only resets permissions and things like default apps. PI When in fist saw it ,,I was like WTH 32% but then it's beta software ,,so we kinda expect it . Yes per app battery usage section with foreground and background Info is really great . But I suspect google play services and Android os battery section will not be effective that much unless they show wahts making them to suck up battery . Sabin Bajracharya Meanwhile Google's own apps will somehow be able to bypass this restriction :D Michael Sørensen Google's own location services, Now cards, Chrome, etc. eats the most battery for me - even worse with location history on. How about fixing that first...? WarpspeedScp Try Firefox! Also, turn location off as soon as you can. mlm5em But with O, you can now turn off Background activity on an app specific basis. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/eaaaef5de863733535628a24f5b0d44f888ae3ff0cb89d1c8cffc0680083c526.png mattcoz Good to see there's an option to turn it off. Morten Ulv Very handy! IncCo Anything that improves the battery life is awesome John Monks I have concerns about this. There are some apps I *want* running in the background, but I don't want them filling up the notification shade. One example, Lightflow has to have a pointless notification in order to do the job I installed it to do. I know it's there, any consequences for my battery life are mine to live with. It would be OK if I could toggle a setting to permit a particular app to run a 'free running background service' silently but this is Google so I expect I'll have to put up with spam instead (and no, collapsed notifications are still notifications), or there will be a toggle that does nothing, like the 'ignore optimisation' setting that currently exists. Drakenoid There apparently is, check comments above, there's a screenshot. David Onter You can disable all notifications from an app, which removes the permanent notification. Cakefish It's about damn time. All hail Android O. AdamH So does it mean my phone will be useless? something_new Apple was right then Đức Thành I'm beginning to get excited again, even knowing that actually achieving this would take many years. Fidelator Allow us, the end user, to have absolute control over which apps can run in the background under certain conditions, I have disabled notifications on Facebook and Instagram yet they still have multiple persistent RAM hogging battery sucking services 100% of the time smeddy My next phone won't get a look-in without a 4000mah+ battery in it. Since Samsung dropped the removable battery, battery anxiety has crept back into my life. abc Multi-day battery life? Ha! I solved this over a decade ago. The key to long battery life is having an actual life. Have friends and family and an active social life. Don't be the loser who keeps fiddling with his phone every few mins, when everyone already knows you don't get any important messages. You'll be amazed how long your battery lasts when you aren't pulling out to jerk off on it every few mins. And for god's sake, at home, a cell phone should be no different than a landline. If you're watching videos or playing games on your 5" inch screen, you need to invest in a PC or console. Sk0ly Good for Google. Some apps, particularly Facebook and Facebook messenger run ALWAYS in the background, even when you haven't used the applications in days. In my opinion, this is just lazy coding and is likely due to Facebook's data mining. In comparison, Hangouts and Allo only run on demand. Android has always allowed developers freedom to responsibly code their apps to allow them to do more. This is recognition that this freedom has been abused and now developers have to be treated more similarly to how they are on iOS.

Unfortunately, nowadays, things don’t always work out that easily. Take a look at this research by Steve Rayson. It presents an in-depth analysis of over one million articles and was carried out to understand the correlation between shares and links as well as what type of content gets more shares and links. A randomly selected sample of 100,000 posts showed that more than 50 percent of these posts had two or less Facebook interactions (shares, likes, or comments), and more than 75 percent had no external links. On top of this, the majority of highly profitable industries are extremely competitive when it comes to ranking in Google. That’s why you have to find less competitive niches in your industry and try to acquire a sufficient number of links. Otherwise, your chances of appearing in Google’s top two pages is next to zero. In this article, I’ll share a step-by-step process for developing an effective content strategy that will guarantee that all your posts will generate enough links to begin receiving traffic from Google. I’ve been working on improving and updating this process for quite a long time. This approach will help you avoid creating content that will never rank in Google. 1. Analyze the Competitive Landscape When it comes to creating content that drives traffic from Google, there’s no silver bullet. Each industry has different target audiences that behave in a unique way and require a personalized approach. That being said, I was personally involved in a situation where the research stage was skipped and a generic, elementary approach was used instead. I had a client who worked in education and was interested in acquiring more links for his website. Since content is my favorite way of building links, I like to perform in-depth research that can be effortlessly distributed among bloggers and journalists. However, that’s not how things work in education. In this niche, influencers are teachers who have no clue what SEO is and see no sense in linking to external content. We didn’t take into consideration the reasons why our audience would link to a particular page. That’s why we failed with our research, had to regroup, and were forced to return to the research stage. Eventually, we came up with a solution. We conducted comprehensive research and found that a majority of teachers want to link to roundups and interviews they’ve taken part in because they see such activities as notable and they want to be recognized. My story confirms that if you don’t want to waste your time, effort, and money on trial and error, then your best bet is to invest a substantial amount of time into researching information. Gathering data will point you in the right direction, and it will make it easier for you to create content that journalists and bloggers want to read and link to. Typically, I use a combination of tools like BuzzSumo, Ahrefs, or SEMrush for this. With the help of BuzzSumo, you can get a list of the most shareable and linkable posts by any domain or search term. For instance, here’s a list of the most successful posts for the search query “content marketing”: The reason you want to use Ahrefs or SEMrush in addition to BuzzSumo is because the latter doesn’t provide data about organic traffic. That’s a really important and, unfortunately, missing piece of BuzzSumo. You have to export everything from BuzzSumo and add two more columns with the URL’s number of keywords and organic traffic: This data tells us that if you’re going to create a post that will include the keyword “content marketing” in its title, then you need to have approximately 24 referring domains linking to this post to begin receiving around 100 organic visitors on a monthly basis. Also, about 40 percent of analyzed articles have 10 or so linking domains, but this won’t bring any organic visitors. However, more than half of those posts show up in search for at least one keyword in Google’s top 100 results. So there’s potential to get enough traffic if you get more links. Furthermore, after looking at our dataset, I spotted a couple of features that all the successful pieces of content had in common: All of these pieces have been published on well-established domains with strong link profiles. Here are the domains and their overall SEO performance, which includes their number of referring domains and organic traffic: Only a couple of domains have less than 10,000 linked sites, so it’s not that easy to rank for keywords related to the search query “content marketing”. Analyzing the titles and the content revealed that the following types of posts seem to perform the best: List-based articles that might cover the best or the most inspiring content marketing examples. Predictions, trends, and statistics. With the help of this quick yet powerful analysis, you can evaluate the real cost of each piece of content as well as how much effort and time you need to invest in it to begin receiving organic traffic. In our case, the topic “content marketing” requires no less than 24 referring domains per post, as well as having an authoritative domain as part of your backlink profile. 2. Strategically Link to Relevant Content in Your Articles This step will help you distribute your content among desired sources and spend less time acquiring links. You can use BuzzSumo to discover articles that are relevant to your future post and that have also gained enough links. But make sure you check what kind of sites refer to those articles. Ideally, you need to find anywhere from 10 to 20 sites that you want to establish relationships with and eventually link to them. In order to make things happen the right way, you need to reach out to them and let them know you have something they may be interested in publishing, but don’t forget to properly mention the selected sites in your article. If they’re interested in your offer, you’ll need to feature them in your article accordingly. To make things a bit easier for you, here are some ideas on how to achieve this: Ask to quote an expert, industry professional, or researcher. Add a list of useful resources at the end of your piece. Link to their posts where it’s appropriate. Conduct a short survey and list all the experts who participated. 3. Prepare Your Outreach Strategy in Advance If you spend a couple of days making a list of people you want to reach out to via social media or email, it’ll help you reach your goals much faster. You need to gear up with a list of Twitter accounts and Facebook and LinkedIn groups that are relevant to the subject of your piece of content. Also, when reaching out on Facebook and LinkedIn, you need to work on your introduction pitch because social media is all about captivating brevity. When it comes to contacting bloggers, it makes sense to use a list of sites you’ve analyzed in your previous articles, but extend this list by including sites that publish content on related topics. For instance, if the topic you’ve selected is “content marketing,” posts that cover how to build links through content will work for you. After you build a list of domains, you need to track down the person responsible for a specific article or blog. BuzzSumo will usually display the author’s name. If not, then try LinkedIn. Need to find someone’s email address? Try a tool called Hunter.io. By collecting all necessary information well beforehand, you’ll be able to reach all of your goals, save a lot of time, and connect with a much broader audience. That’s exactly what you need to increase your number of social shares and links. Summary Yes, implementing this strategy requires a lot more than just simply writing high-quality content then promoting a couple of SMM shout-outs. However, if you’d like to create and nurture your content the old-fashioned way, then you’ll have to wait more than two years for it to begin performing, and even longer for it to start driving traffic. If you’re short on time, feeling impatient, and want to see traffic flowing in now, then simply follow the steps I described above, and let organic traffic find you.

Google loves Easter eggs and in Android Lollipop it introduced a hidden game within the operating system’s settings. The game was a nod to the once popular Flappy Bird that sparked countless clones and reportedly made its developer a ton of money. It can be accessed in Lollipop and Marshmallow versions without having to download anything extra, just go to Settings > About Phone and look for the Android version number. Tap it several times and you’ll see the corresponding Android version logo. Tap the logo a few more times followed by a long press and the secret mini-game will appear. Much like Flappy Bird, a tap makes your character jump and you’ll need to avoid obstacles as long as you can to keep the Android robot alive. The game alternates which way it moves so you could be jumping between lollipops or marshmallows — depending on your version of Android — going left or right. Starting with Android Nougat, "Flappy Droid" has taken the back seat to Android Neko (below), but it's still possible to access two older Easter eggs: Marshmallow Land and Dessert Case. The code for these seems an intentional leftover by Google, hidden under the System UI app. To launch these you'll need to download a third-party launcher app (Activity Launcher is simple and free). From the top drop down menu select "All Activities," scroll down to System UI. Then look for Marshmallow Land (Flappy Droid) and Dessert Case, an older Easter egg from the 'Kit Kat' days. Android Neko Google also included a new mini game in Nougat (and Android O Beta) but it takes a few extra steps to access it. The game is called Android Neko and is a take on the “Neko Atsume Kitty Collector” virtual cat collecting game, but it’s presented as a function of the OS that you play passively. You start off the same way by going to Settings > About Phone then tapping on the Android version number until the Nougat logo comes up. Tap a few more times followed by a long press and if you’ve done it right a small cat emoji will appear towards the bottom of your screen. From here you need to swipe down from the top of your screen two times to fully expand your Quick Settings panel, then press the "Edit" button in the bottom-right corner of this menu. Scroll down to the bottom of the list, and you'll find a tile labeled "Android Easter Egg." Long-press this tile, then drag it up into the top part of this panel so it’s accesible among your regular Quick Settings toggles. You’ve unlocked the game, now it’s time to put food out in the hopes of luring a cat that you can catch and share with friends. Expand your Quick Settings menu again, then tap the "Empty Dish" icon. You'll be prompted to pick a snack — Bits, Fish, Chicken, or Treat. Pick one and patiently wait. It may take a few hours for your treat to lure in a cat but eventually you’ll receive a notification that says “A cat is here” along with its number. When you open the notification you’ll be taken to your ‘Cats’ menu, this is where you’ll be able to see all the cats you collect. You can tap any of them to give them custom names and by long pressing on a cat you’ll be presented with options to share it or, god forbid, delete it. There are hundreds of cats available and you can always go back to the Cats menu to browse the ones you’ve caught by long-pressing on the dish or food icon in your Quick Settings panel. 5 days, 5 killer tech tips is a TechSpot monthly feature On the third week of every month, we'll publish 5 killer tech tips, one for each day of the week for a given app, service, or platform.

AutoVoice for Chrome can add Google Assistant voice commands to your PC Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/02 11:11am PDTMay 2, 2017 27 Plus 1 on G+ 49 Share on Facebook 54 Share on Twitter Total Shares130 Applications Google News Videos Google launched Assistant last year in Allo, and then it came to the Pixel and Google Home. The period of exclusivity for Google is over now with Assistant on tons of Android devices, and there's even an API for developers to implement on just about anything. Case in point, there is now a version of the AutoVoice Chrome extension that can call upon the power of Assistant. However, the setup process is quite a slog. The video above shows the end result of the setup, and it looks pretty neat. You can use the Chrome extension to contact Assistant from your PC with any wake up phrase you want (because AutoVoice) and use the same commands you would on other Assistant devices. In order to get this working, you have to go through two setup processes: the first to get Assistant on your PC, and another to plug in AutoVoice. You need to enter some text in a command line, but there's an XDA tutorial for the Assistant installation. The AutoVoice dev has instructions on how to download the special AutoVoice version of the Google Assistant server. Again, command lines. This lacks the polish of a finished product, but it could be a cool evening project if you want to mess around with it.

But we all have our own priorities. Lars Jeppesen That's true but I*m not the one saying Assistant is stupid in comparison to Google Now.. they're different beasts in many regards imho Good_Ole_Pinocchio I'm the one saying it's stupid because Google has it gimped out of the gate.

New, 33 comments For those of us who prefer software to be reactive rather than proactive by Vlad Savov@vladsavov May 22, 2017, 9:37am EDT share tweet Linkedin Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge At Google I/O this past week, I got my first taste of the next version of Android and I enjoyed almost everything about it. Android has gotten to the stage where improvements come in only incremental steps, and Google is mostly making the right ones with its annual updates. But I have an underlying worry about where this is all going: as Android grows more proactive and assistive, I fear it might end up alienating its more technically inclined users. So here’s a radical thought: maybe there’s now room for more than one canonical variant of Android. I can already hear the chorus of disagreement, chanting the word "fragmentation" with cautionary zeal, but Google is already working on a modified version with Android Go, its extra lean serving for lower-spec devices. What I have in mind is a similarly stripped-down option intended for pro users: an Android Pro. Google’s vision of the future of Android — and the future of mobile and personal technology more broadly — is defined by automation. Google Assistant is the user-facing aspect of an artificial intelligence juggernaut that promises to transform how we use our devices and, in many ways, make us more dependent on them. Oreos for the pros As Android has evolved, it has consistently moved closer to Apple’s deliberately simplified approach to mobile software. The latest Android O streamlines the settings menu by presenting only the most-used options and tucking the rest away into expandable "advanced" menus. With every version of the core OS and app updates, I see more hand holding and bigger training wheels from Google. As enthusiastic a Google Photos user as I am, I don’t like being nagged to back up my photos every time I open the app, and I don’t think I’ll much enjoy receiving constant reminders about Google photo books when they become available. There used to be a time when Google Maps was just a mapping application, but now it takes a couple of extra seconds to load while Google furnishes it with extra search options and local business information (mostly the locations of the nearest pizzerias). Maps has also developed an unfortunate habit of pumping notifications my way, whether it’s for road traffic that isn’t relevant to me or urging me to contribute my photos of known landmarks. It is while setting up a new Android phone, as I uncheck every superfluous notification option on Maps, Android Pay, Docs, Drive, Photos, and YouTube that I come to think, this is Windows behavior. My standard operating procedure with any new Windows PC setup is to deselect all the options that Microsoft ticks for me — and now Android is bulking out to match that (admittedly minor) annoyance. Speaking with Android chief Hiroshi Lockheimer during Google I/O, I was told that the teams responsible for all of these apps make their decisions based on a lot of user research and (anonymized, he was quick to point out) data. One of Android’s outstanding challenges is informing people of everything the system can do, and the prompts for action from Google’s apps are helpful pointers for neophytes. In essence, Google’s lowest common denominator is gradually shifting lower, as the company looks to scoop up every last feature phone holdout while at the same time matching the accessibility of Apple’s iOS. If cars can have a sport mode that disables assists, why not phones too? There’s always a balance to be struck when trying to keep experienced users moving at their fastest without leaving new ones behind. The trouble for me is that Google’s assistive efforts aren’t all optional. The suggested email replies of Google Inbox, for example, were promoted to the main Gmail app in Android during I/O — and, much like my colleague Adi Robertson, I find them off-putting in the way they impersonate me. Aside from the inappropriateness of offering canned responses when someone might be reading an intensely personal message, these responses just take up screen space. If cars can have a sport mode that stiffens the suspension, heightens throttle response, and disables driving assists for a purer and faster experience, why not phones, too? I want something like Android Go — barebones, simplified, streamlined to run as fast as possible — but with all the latest and greatest capabilities that Android can support. All the torque, none of the training wheels. My idea for an Android Pro wouldn’t meaningfully contribute to Android’s long-unresolved issue of software fragmentation because the thing I envision is taking features away, not adding more. I can live without Google Assistant and without Uber and Lyft being directly integrated into Maps. Just give me the familiar single-purpose, siloed-off apps, and let me worry about connecting the dots between them. That’s the way Android grew to its present popularity, and there are many of us already accustomed to highly effective workflows built atop its simple, un-enhanced structure. An Android Pro could also serve as a useful branding tool, giving Android OEMs an excuse not to mess around with creating their own skins and user assists, shipping Google’s prepared code as it is, which could in turn accelerate updates and reinforce the idea of this being an OS for professionals. Apple might not have more than one version of iOS, but then Apple isn’t trying to address the full range of smartphone users. Google, on the contrary, wants to put an Android device in everyone’s hands, and that’s what has pushed it to create Android Go for the affordable segment of the market. Now how about an Android Pro for the enthusiast and professional groups that gave Android its first taste of success?

This issue affects developers creating $0.99 games as well as those coding $5 photo editing applications. To make up for lost revenue, developers have turned to using in-app purchases as well as subscription-based models. To make subscriptions a more viable option for companies and individual developers alike, Google has introduced several new tools within the Google Play Console… UAG Samsung Galaxy S8 Cases The latest tool for developers to use is a new subscription dashboard within the Play Console. Here, they can see “new subscribers, cancellations, and total subscribers. It also displays daily and 30-day rolling revenue data, and highlights your top-performing products.” Basically, Google is able to track all of these important numbers for you automatically which might help identify an issue with your subscription model or be the deciding factor in a future business decision. The second new tool is something called “account hold.” Available for developers starting in June, account hold is a way for an application to block premium content from being displayed if a user’s payment does not go through. According to research done by Google, companies that used account hold saw a 25 percent increase in its renewal rate because the withholding of premium features was enough for most users to take out their wallets and renew. If you would like to know more about Google’s new tools as well as other insightful data about the use of a subscription-based revenue model, you can read Google’s blog post on the subject. Additionally, you can watch the “Make more money with subscriptions on Google Play” session from Google I/O 2017 embedded below.

This feature was enabled online right after its announcement, but it now looks like the feature is rolling out to the Google Photos app on Android. UAG Samsung Galaxy S8 Cases A member of Android Police noticed over the weekend that the photo book creation tool was showing up on his Pixel XL. As you can see from AP’s screenshots below, the option to create a book can be found in the overflow menu, right above the device folders category. As Artem was running the latest version (2.15.0.156463917) of Google Photos and he appears to be one of the few already seeing the photo book option, it looks like this change is being done server-side.

On April 7, a DoL attorney, as well as a department's regional solicitor provided The Guardian with some details related to the investigation, in particular, about the evidence of extreme discrimination and pay disparities in Google obtained by the department, as well as about Google attempts to hide the relevant data. The IT giant used this interview as a pretext to file a motion for the case dismissal, stressing potential violation of the ethics rules by the attorney, though the motion was rejected by the court. The newspaper added that the company also tried to restrict press access during a hearing, held last month, however, the request was also rejected by the judge. In April, the DoL said in a statement that it discovered pay inequities in 2015 data on wages, though it needed to obtain more documents to access the issue, as well as to interview employees. As Google is a federal contractor, it must comply with equal opportunity laws and provide the DoL records for inspection. Google has repeatedly denied all accusations, claiming that the payment gap was eliminated by compensation schemes, though no relevant data was provided.

The latest was a major December update aimed at improving the game. There’s plenty to love about the latest changes, but it’s also causing problems for some. Here we’ll explain how to fix the “Device is not compatible” error while trying to update Clash of Clans on Android. Additionally, we have more details about Google accounts not syncing correctly for saved villages. It’s one of the most popular titles on Android and iOS. Millions of people play it daily. This isn’t the first time we’ve seen this error message, but recently it has been happening more frequently. Most other issues can be fixed with the instructions below. Read: Clash of Clans Updates: 7 Things We Want Next The last update added tons of level 11 troops, cheaper costs and other things. However, it also added some problems. In fact, some can’t update the game at all. As a result it can’t be played. This is a big issue, and hopefully the few suggestions below can help. If you haven’t updated you’ll see a notification upon launching the game that an update is available. You cannot play until you accept this, go to the Google Play Store, and update to the latest version of the game. Everything is fine for those on iOS, but Android users are being met with a very odd problem. Users are getting an error on the Google Play Store for Clash of Clans that says, “Device is not compatible with this version” and are unable to update. Supercell confirmed this is a problem, and has offered up a fix for those having issues. Players affected by "Your device is not compatible with this version", please try: Settings >App Manager>Google Play Store>Clear data/cache — Clash of Clans (@ClashofClans) January 26, 2016 If you can’t update, you can’t play. Some are even in an active Clan War and can’t update in order to fight before time runs out. Which as many can imagine, would be very frustrating. Update: On February 26th Supercell made some changes and had another small maintenance break to fix the device incompatible and other Google services issues. Let us know in the comments below if the problem is still going on. Update #2: On March 4th Supercell finally fixed the Google Play Store device not compatible Clash of Clans problem, as well as the Google Games ID and sync issue many users have been experiencing. According to them, those who were unable to sync their Google Games account to restore or save a village, and the thousands of users who couldn’t update, should all be able to download the latest update from the Google Play Store release late last night and this morning. Head into the Play Store, check for updates, and download it right now to get back to Clashing. Update #3: The new December Clash of Clans update made this issue appear again. Users have also experienced crashes while in global chat, chat logs being out of order and other small things. Supercell may release another optional update to fix this. Even people that have been using the same device for well over a year are having issues. We’re seeing reports all over Twitter that people with tablets, the LG G3, Galaxy S6 and other devices are all experiencing this error. I’ve updated a Galaxy S7, Nexus 6P, Pixel C tablet and Nexus 9 all without any problems. So we’re not sure what is causing this at the moment, or what Android devices are experiencing it. been playing #COC on the same phone for 3 months and today its telling me that my device is not compatible with this version @ClashofClans — EllisWard✌️ (@fan_paige_wwe) January 26, 2016 If you are trying to update Clash of Clans on an Android device but running into problems, there are a few potential fixes. There is either something messed up with the Google Play Store, or something Supercell did. They’re blaming it on the Google Play, and suggest users clear the Store cache or data to resolve it. Above are basic instructions, but below are screenshots to help those experiencing issues. Instructions To fix the Clash of Clans update “your device is not compatible with this version” error message, try clearing the Google Play Store cache, and then data. Next, restart the Google Play Store and accept the update again. Pull down the notification bar on your Android device and hit the gear-shaped settings icon, or find “settings” in the application tray. From here navigate to Apps, or App Manager. Next scroll down and find Google Play Store. Select this, and tap “Clear Cache or Data” as shown below. This should erase everything, and get rid of any corrupt files that seem to be causing this problem. Supercell claims this will fix the error. Multiple comments suggest it worked. Now go back and download the update. Other Options However, if this doesn’t solve the problem another option is to uninstall Clash of Clans and re-install it. Yes, that sounds scary, and no one wants to lose their entire village by uninstalling the game. You won’t. Obviously proceed at your own risk and use caution. Read: How to Transfer Clash of Clans to a New Phone If the game is backed up to Google+ or Google Games (an option in settings) your progress is saved. Meaning you can uninstall Clash, reinstall it, and restore your progress simply by going into settings and connecting to Google+, and it will restore your village in less than 10 seconds. However, if you never linked the two, this won’t work. So do not uninstall Clash of Clans unless you know it’s backed up. The guide above goes over a few details regarding transferring the game to a new phone, which is also how you can save progress. That said, if you can’t open the game you can’t link it to Google Games. Do not uninstall Clash of Clans unless you know it is saved. Conclusion This is a big problem. Supercell states that clearing the Google Play Store cache is your only option, and it should solve any issues. They’re currently looking into other options, and will offer up additional information if available. At the end of the day, did clearing the cache or data fix it for you? Let us know in the comments below. Those who fixed it using other methods, feel free to share it below. The December update was loaded with content and a Christmas theme. Expect a bug fixing update in 2017 along with removal of the winter theme. 246 Responses 01/26/2016 kim Reply No, it did not work for me. It is asking me to redeem and then asking for a code. 01/27/2016 Tyr Reply Heya! It didn’t work out for me at first until I cleared out my Google Play Services as well. Hope it helps! 01/28/2016 JUCARIBU Reply THAT WORK FOR ME THANKS 01/31/2016 Albertman Reply My clash restored and updated after i deleted the cache and data from google play store and play store services 02/02/2016 C. Sims Reply Listen to the man or woman lol… Delete all data in “Google Play Store” & “Google Play Services” from your phones settings… this guaranteed to work (then go back to Google play store, accept terms. Then update the app)… from what I know it works with newer phones, if not you could be out of luck. 04/19/2016 ScottManJo Reply Finally got all my favorite Supercell games loaded onto my Galaxy Tab E Lite. Be sure to clear out the Cache & Date from the following 3 apps: Google Play Services, Google Play Store AND Google Play Games. I was able to get CoC & Boom Beach by clearing the first 2 but only could get Clash Royale after clearing Google Play Games. Hope this helps! Good luck & god speed! 05/02/2016 Jeremy Reply ^^ had to do all 3 for mine to work also! Thanks. 07/17/2016 Michael Reply OMG DUDE THANKS!! I got the same device and got super nervous when I couldnt get clash of clans! Your a lifesaver! 10/26/2016 Arjun Reply Now This worked for me.. erazin all 3 of those.. 05/27/2016 Uhoh Reply Worked for me too. Thanks! 02/06/2016 Laryssa Reply I have the g4 it didn’t work for me. Won’t even come up when I search it. Neither does boom beach so I am guessing it has something to do with supercell. Very frustrating because I have been playing for over a year 04/24/2016 Emily Reply Same here, very frustrated and I can’t back it up as to is so I can’t uninstall and reinstall even if I could. 02/20/2016 Shaun Reply i am having this issue with needing a redeem code to even get on the play store now! 02/29/2016 Moaz Reply Thank you very much, it worked immedietly after i did these easy steps, am really grateful :-) thx again 03/20/2016 Logan Reply Didn’t work for me. It said the cache was cleared, but still refused to download. 03/22/2016 anirban mitra Reply m using nokia x series and google play store is not supported in my device..how can i back up if i uninstall it 03/26/2016 Amanda George Reply I just bought a new tablet and it is saying device in not compatible. I have nothing to clear out. I don’t understand. 07/03/2016 wardojr Reply try updating play store service… 01/26/2016 sol goslin Reply No it diddnt work. I had hopes it would but no such luck. This sucks. I cant even get to the supercell customer service/help line. There may be other issues with this though. Im also noticing a significant drop in the speed of my device, so it may be something that either supercell got in its system, or someone hacked google and delivered a little viral surprise. If thats the case Im sure it will make itself known in a bigger than life fashion. Hopefully that isnt the case. Keep posting updates on what happens. A LOT of people are locked out of the game through this. 07/22/2016 Clara Icasiano Reply just uninstall in play games then install it again. Hope it works :) \ 01/26/2016 Tom Reply no…. 01/26/2016 Steve Reply Hi. I’m on an amazon fire tablet which doesnt support google+ so my game isn’t backed up.

Try giving that a shot 01/26/2016 Mike Reply Didn’t work on my LG G4, I tried u installing and reinstalling… Still not compatible. 01/27/2016 Tyr Reply I use LG as well.

This isn’t the first time and they always say the same fixes and is not working. He brought a new phone and 3_4 months , the same problem. And with their lack of customer service good luck on their emails telling you to contact them in the game. If not fixed soon I will retire my three accounts and so will my friend with four, and its sad seeing that we both spent over $150 on accounts each. 01/28/2016 Nathalie Blues Reply I have spent over $1300 and lead a clan where my friends have spent the same. This is not acceptable SuperCell. Get with the freaking program and fix this. Fix it now ! 01/26/2016 dan Reply Did not work for me either. Th 9 and 3 years of playing gone. They need to sort this shit out. That’s bullshit. 01/26/2016 Scott Reply Didn’t work on my galaxy s5 active. Thus is very frustrating being I’m in a active war and can’t attack.

What worked was clearing cache per the suggestion, but when doing the update go to my apps and bulk update all apps that need an update. If I went directly to COC under my apps I still got a message stating it wasn’t compatible. 01/26/2016 Dave Reply I deleted the game and now its completely gone from the google play store, same for boom beach 01/26/2016 Bethany Reply Nope didnt work 01/26/2016 Ryan Reply After just clearing the cache my problem was fixed . hope that helps everyone else 01/26/2016 LEI Reply Me too..tried to uninstall coc but unforunately when i try to download it again, cannot find coc in play store… Help pls… 01/26/2016 Anthony Williams Reply Didn’t work for my kindle fire. 01/26/2016 Bob the clasher Reply Figured it out!!

Tried updating, no dice. Tried Clearing the data and cache, same. Tried uninstalling\reinstalling, no longer able to even see COC in Google Play. Re-tried clearing the GP cache and data, still not available. 01/27/2016 Techymarkbo Reply For those not seeing in Google Play store after installing, You have to go to Google Play Games app in order to install after uninstalling. Your device is listed as not compatible so it will not show up. Also, if you find a copy of the new update By searching coc apk file on Google, it will install by side loading also. 01/27/2016 Techymarkbo Reply Here is a link to the latest download for sideloading. http://www.apkmirror.com/apk/supercell/clash-of-clans/clash-clans-8-116-2-android-apk-download/ 01/27/2016 Shawn Reply S5 being playing for a year now suddenly cant play, this is unacceptable, why was the upgrade not tested, when will you resolve it?! 01/27/2016 Umang Reply For everyone who’s facing this problem..go to Google play store through your browser, log in and install the game.

After I post the above comment, now it show up on my play game and when click install in my play game, it redirect me to play store and god bless the install button shows up! Installing.. Later update u guy on that 01/27/2016 bernard Reply OK.. Nexus 9 brand new lollipop 5.0 after setting my google account straight looking for coc(not dare to update firmware) 1. It did not show up on play store but yes did show on play game. Click install on play game redirect me to play store but is list under incompatible device. No install button after that 2. Read comment here and have tried clear cache, data and uninstall update for play store, play game, and play service. Still no luck. Not even show up in play store. 3. Post my comment here and back try again. It just suddenly show up. Install it and play.. No lag no issue. Around 1 hours of time for me to make that god damn stupid install button appear in my play store for doc game! Stupid conclusion from me after tried to install it. Someone say clear 3 time and bulk update. So, MAYBE after we have clear that, it will automatic download the update for playstore and it need sometime for that and without any notification on it. Give it some time after clear cache and data than try again. Hope that’s help. 01/27/2016 Sean Reply Motorola moto 3. Cleared cacache. Nope. Cleared data. Nope.

Then you get the message of incompatibility. I cleared Play Store cache and data once. Not solved. Did it once more and restarted the phone. Not solved. Instead chose option ‘update all’ on notification drop-down menu. It updated CoC! Opened CoC page in Play Store. Did still after update say device not compatible and no option to open the game.

I decided to uninstall the game and check the store, where it still said my device (LG phone) wasn’t compatible. Vexing to say the least.

Rishi Chandra, senior product manager of Google, discusses the Google Home device during a product launch event in San Francisco last fall. Credit: Michael Short/Bloomberg Most Popular Here is Google's vision for the future of computing: As you drive home from work, you tell your car, "Ok, Google," triggering the company's Assistant. You order food, the digital helper handles the transaction and makes sure it's ready when you arrive. Right now, Amazon and its Alexa digital assistant are closer to realizing that goal, having cut a deal this year with Ford Motor Co. to let drivers search, shop and control other devices by voice from their vehicles. That's just one of the ways Amazon is outpacing Google in the race to weave a digital assistant into consumers' lives. What's more, Amazon has a leading e-commerce business well suited to this emerging world, with a massive delivery network to speed orders to shoppers -- an area where Google has struggled. Amazon's Echo connected speakers, launched in 2014, have given Alexa an early lead by reaching millions of users at home, while Google's rival Home device only came out late last year. "Amazon kind of fell into this lead in 2014 because it wanted to sell more things to people in new ways," said Brian Roemmele, founder of ReadMultiplex.com, a website about voice-based commerce and computing. "Google is trying to evolve its online search experience into devices that have a voice. That philosophy limits its ability to really go after Amazon." Related Stories Stop Saying AI Can't Replace Humans Central to Alexa's appeal: Amazon has thousands of voice-based apps up and running, far outnumbering Google's tally. The Alphabet unit used its recent I/O developer conference to try to narrow Amazon's lead by wooing skilled programmers capable of building tools and services that can make the Google Assistant more useful. The company stressed experience with mobile software and the millions of things it already understands on the web and in the real world. Vehicle and payment functions were rolled out to expand the Assistant beyond the more simple ways people use it now, such as setting alarms and playing music. "A lot of what you need to get done is transactional," said Gummi Hafsteinsson, product director for the Assistant. "We take care of all the nitty-gritty hard parts." Technology giants think voice-based computing could be the next big platform, after mobile. The company that wins will have the most users talking to devices and the most developers creating new experiences. Google's Assistant has only been active for six months. That's a major disadvantage when it comes to creating that virtuous circle of users and developers. It tried to get that circle spinning faster at I/O. About 7,000 conference attendees were offered a free Google Home speaker and $700 worth of credits for its cloud-computing service. The company is hoping these developers will use both to build and test new voice-based apps (known as Actions on Google) for the company's Assistant. It needs to fire up these developers, many of whom have already been building for Amazon's Alexa system. By February, there were 10,000 Alexa Skills -- the equivalent of an app for Amazon's voice-based system -- up from 1,000 in June 2016. Bloomberg News counted fewer than 300 Actions for Google's Assistant built by outside developers on Friday afternoon. Last June, the voice-based technology wasn't available publicly yet. Not even near the 'uncany valley' Artificial intelligence researchers talk about an "uncanney valley" in which human-like machines make people uneasy. Neither Google or Amazon has to worry about that yet, with even naturally conversant tabletop devices still far off. But Google is leaning on its expertise in AI fields like voice recognition and automated language understanding to push it ahead if or when this form of human-computer interaction takes off. It also hopes long experience collecting and organizing information from the web will provide a useful fallback solution when the company's Assistant lacks a specific Action to address user questions. Take cooking recipes, an early use for hands-free speakers. By November, Alexa could talk budding home chefs through more than 60,000 recipes. That came from a Skills integration with the cooking app Allrecipes. The latest Echo Look device, with a screen, is particularly well suited to voice-based kitchen use because it can show people recipes, as well as tell them about ingredients and cooking steps. Asking Google's Assistant to talk to Allrecipes on Friday afternoon turned up web links rather than an integrated voice-based Action. However, the Assistant has access to 45,000 recipe websites that have already been marked up with special code that lets Google's software read out ingredients and other related information, Hafsteinsson said. "Google has better understanding. It has been working on AI much longer," said Patricia Carando, a mobile developer attending the I/O conference. She's been working on an Alexa Skill, but she was learning how to create an Action for Google's Assistant during coding classes at the event on Thursday. Eventually, consumers will pick one digital assistant "and stick with it," pushing developers to mostly build on that platform, she added. A deep concern for Google is that more people will stick with Amazon or a potential device from other competitors like Apple. That's behind Google's rush to integrate its Assistant with any and all connected devices. At I/O, Google executives unveiled Home Graph, a system for connecting and controlling smart home devices by speaking to the Assistant. There are about 70 outside companies working with Google to sync things like dishwashers, fridges and light bulbs to the voice-based platform, including GE Appliances, Osram Lighting and Leviton, the internet giant said. Even so, Amazon is making the most of its earlier start. The day before I/O began, a new Amazon program emerged for outside developers working with the company's Alexa digital assistant, which controls its Echo devices and a rising number of other gadgets. If users talk a lot to a developer's Alexa Skill, then Amazon will send a reward of cold hard cash, according to note posted Amazon's Alexa developer website. What it means to be an assistant On Amazon's website, there are hundreds of home devices already for sale that work with Alexa, made by roughly 30 companies such as Samsung Electronics, Philips and Wink. Google is taking pains to show how easy it is to use its tools. During an I/O demo in front of a packed crowd of developers on Thursday, a Google engineer built a simple Action for the Assistant that turned on a set of virtual light bulbs, then turned them green, by voice. The company is working on "What it means to be a washing machine," the engineer said, to giggles from some in the audience. Google is also working on what it means to be an assistant. Organizing web information and supporting apps is familiar terrain. Discerning what consumers want to hear from their voice-based devices is new territory. At an another panel during the week, Google engineers showed developers a list of criteria the company uses to decide what Actions and other data to surface within its new Assistant world. Those included questions about whether end users had to repeat requests, learned something or "LOL" (laughed out loud). The company rarely exposes such specific guidelines. It's famously secretive about these types of criteria when it comes to search results, to avoid website developers gaming the system and ruining the experience. The fact that it's being so open, shows how eager it is to lure a new army of outside voice-based developers. "Please, please think about those things," Valerie Nygaard, a Google product manager, told the audience. "These are the questions we ask ourselves." -- Bloomberg News In this article: A.I.

Tech Industry by Katie Collins May 22, 2017 6:15 AM PDT @katiecollins European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager has led the fight against Google. John Thys/AFP/Getty Images The European Union's years-long, seemingly never-ending investigation into Google is coming to an end at last, according to an EU official. Regulators will rule in the next few months on whether Google abused its dominant position to get people to use its apps and services over those of rivals, Reuters reported Monday. The tech giant is accused of guiding people who use its platforms like search and Android toward picking its own services by promoting them high up in listings and toward using its own apps by insisting they get preloaded on phones. The EU is worried this may have stopped people from discovering other services and apps that may better suit their needs. The pan-European governing body has gone toe to toe with tech companies for almost as long as people have had personal computers and other gadgets close at hand, dating back at least to its landmark judgment against Microsoft in 2004. More recently the targets of its investigations have included Apple, for its tax practices; Amazon, for e-book deals; and Facebook and Twitter, for hate speech on their sites. Europe's Competition Commission is examining three separate antitrust complaints against Google, one of which dates back to 2010. If the EU decides Google is breaking its rules, it could fine the company up to 10 percent of its annual global turnover for each case. "In the next few months, we will reach a decision on the Google cases, Google search, AdSense and to me the most interesting is Android," Tommaso Valletti, the Commission's chief competition economist, told a conference organized by the University of Oxford's Centre for Competition Law and Policy. A spokesman for the EU Competition Commission did not immediately respond to a request for further comment. Special Reports: CNET's in-depth features in one place.

Home > Google News > Should Google Assistant Be Part Of Google's Core iOS App Should Google Assistant Be Part Of Google's Core iOS App May 22, 2017 • 8:10 am | (2) by Barry Schwartz | Filed Under Google Search Engine Prev Story Next story Tweet Pin It   Prev Story Next Story The other day, out of Google I/O, we reported the news about Google Assistant for iPhone. But it is a standalone app, you need to download yet another Google app to your iPhone. The Google Assistant app is over here. That makes 87 different iPhone apps for iOS from Google. 87! So Danny Sullivan did a poll on Twitter asking if you prefer Google Assistant to be baked into the Google app or separate. Only 150 people or so took the poll but most said the app should be combined as one app: Take my poll? -- I would like Google Assistant in the Google Search App on iOS -- I like them being two separate apps.— Danny Sullivan (@dannysullivan) May 17, 2017 Google believe people use the Google app to search for things while Google Assistant is different behavior. I wouldn't be surprised if Google does bring in the Assistant features into the core Google App, and even into other apps like Google Maps and more over time. Do you think it is useful to have it as a separate app? Search is changing - so put it into the Google core app. Forum discussion at Twitter.

The problem is, when someone is complaining that their web site has lost a ton of traffic from Google and then someone at Google tells you that this is as expected, that can hurt. One webmaster shared this graph showing the decline in his web site's traffic: He then asked John Mueller what is going on with Google. Why is his web site not ranking well anymore. John then responds that it is ranking where it should. @Consellero Double-checking some of that, I don't see any negative-SEO effects in play. From our point of view, your site is ranking normally.— John ☆.o(≧▽≦)o.☆ (@JohnMu) May 22, 2017 That is a huge zinger and it can be hard to hear the truth.

How Google plans to tackle power consumption even more aggressively in Android Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 5:29pm PDTMay 18, 2017 15 Plus 1 on G+ 99 Share on Facebook 58 Share on Twitter Total Shares172 Android OS Development Google News Videos Yesterday at I/O Google had an interesting talk called Background Check and Other Insights into the Android Operating System Framework. It's a long name, but really it's about improving battery life in Android. It went on at great length as to how, exactly, they plan on doing that, and it's quite worth a watch. We have the video here, but if you don't have the half-hour to check it out, then you are welcome to read below. The central methodology Google is using to try to improve things is the idea of visibility. When something is running in the background and doing a ton of stuff like calling your location at quick intervals, it results in battery drain. So now Google wants to change how things happen in the background, by ensuring that free-running background services aren't sucking your battery dry. Background apps will be pushed out of memory when they leave the foreground, and requests for things like location or WiFi happening in the background will only occasionally see new information from Android. Applications that would otherwise receive broadcasts also might not wake up unless they are given an explicit call to do so in the broadcast, although there are some exceptions. Apps can still get around this by being foregrounded in some way, but now that will be something visible that the user is aware of. This focus on visibility for apps will also mean developers will have to make decisions about what is really better to the user. If doing an ongoing notification as a means of bypassing the stuff above would confuse a user, is that really the right thing for them to do in that case? Other tools can be used to schedule your tasks ahead of time or to wait for events like the job intent service that developers can use in both pre and post-O environments. Jobs and alarms also allow the OS to defer. So, if something happens that would trigger a bunch of other apps to wake up, like a new picture being taken, that can be passed to those apps one at a time after a delay. That way the user doesn't suddenly have a ton of performance issues and drain out of nowhere. Basically, Google wants to solve some of the problems with battery life by defining bad behaviors for developers, like persistent background services or accidental leaks to the background of typically foregrounded activities, and make it clear that things have to be done the right way going forward or their stuff won't work. But it's also giving them new tools and choices for how to best accomplish the things they need to do. The new features in the Play Console and in Android Studio should also help developers be aware of when they are making these mistakes so that they can be fixed. It's a matter of visibility for the developers as well as visibility for the users. To paraphrase Steve Balmer: Visibility, visibility, visibility. A significant user-facing change of this visibility mindset is a new battery menu in O, with a focus on actionable interaction. Instead of just seeing stuff like Screen and Google Play Services next to a number that they won't understand, now users will be given ways of interacting with that data if they don't like it, and can better see how they are using applications without needing to do a bunch of mental calculations. So, when a user has a problem with their expectations of battery performance and goes looking to see what might be causing it, they are more likely to find what caused it, understand what it means, and take action about it. All of these changes are is in pursuit of Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life. Right now the tools in software aren't all there, but these are steps that can take us in that direction.

Good feature to take from iOS Knowledgeborn Allah This does seem similar to what Apple implemented in iOS, but I'm curious about how this will impact RAM management. If it reduces the cache file too much, it'll just close the application completely, and you'll have to start over every time you want to use the app again. Apple somehow found a way around this problem, even in devices with less RAM, but I'm not too sure how Google will accomplish this. Even "doze" on my Pixel XL kills apps in the background all the time. This new thing sounds it could potentially make the problem worse. Justin Osborne Well I sure can tell a difference since upgrading, that's for sure. The new battery section makes me feel a lot better about how the battery is looking. But that's where it ends. Today, I got a full hour less out of my battery than normal. 2 hours vs 3-3.5 on the Pixel. That said, it's a beta, so I'm not complaining. It's definitely not the direction I want to go tho (nor are these new emoticons, sigh). marcusmarcus2 "Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life." I'm glad, but can we get a two pronged attack to address this. Yes, Google needs to keep improving the software side, but OEMs need to help out and quit making thinner phones. They are thin enough, give us more battery capacity. AbdulB1 actually they save quite a lot by putting small batteries in the phones instead of big ones. Krzysztof Jozwik I'm not sure you read OP's comment. Nothing was said about saving... AbdulB1 smaller capacity battery is much cheaper marcusmarcus2 My original comment was not about savings, cheapness, cost, etc. Jack Jennings You've said the same thing twice for no reason. Krzysztof Jozwik I wouldn't say "much" I'm no expert on the matter, but last I checked replacement batteries aren't that expensive, and I don't have the buying power of an oem AbdulB1 Most phones today dont have replacement batteries, they have unremovable ones. OEM or no OEM a 3000mAh battery will always be cheaper than 4000mAh one. marcusmarcus2 I can find batteries for my different Moto G phones that have "Non-User replaceable batteries" for nearly the same price as my LG phones that have user replaceable batteries online. Most likely the OEMs can get them for about the same as well so replaceable or not really does not matter. Either way, yes a 3000mAh battery will be cheaper than a 4000mAh one for OEMs, but probably not much at all, especially at the volume they would by at. I'm guessing they are choosing smaller batteries to make their phones thinner and not because it is slightly cheaper for them. Thinness is better to advertise to most consumers as most consumers are drawn to looks over functionality now a days. I still prefer function over looks for my devices. Krzysztof Jozwik And non replaceable will always be cheaper than replaceable. The point is, the batteries aren't the bulk of the cost. Geoff Johnson What the hell is your point? He never said anything about cost, he was just talking about stop making phones thinner for design and aesthetic reasons. james fuston The idea that smaller and thinner phones result in less battery life is a bit of a misnomer. For an example, I'd refer you to the iPhone SE. marcusmarcus2 I never said smaller and thinner. I just said thinner. They could make some of the phones the same height and width as the current one but make it a little thicker to give a thicker battery, and that would help with the battery life. james fuston Okay, but your general sentiment is still that battery life is tied directly to physical size which, again stating my example of the iPhone SE, isn't the case. The power draw of the components is far more important than the physical size of the phone. marcusmarcus2 My general sentiment is ONLY in regards to thickness of the phone. My sentiment is not to width or height, which also make up the size of the phone. The width and height is usually determined more by the screen where thickness is more often do to battery. A larger screen (component) will draw more power than a smaller screen, I agree with you there. But you seem to think the size of the battery does not make a difference, please correct me if I am wrong. Using your example of iPhone SE, if they would have made that a little thicker than it is now by making the battery larger, that would have made the battery life even longer than it already is. That is my point. james fuston > A larger screen (component) will draw more power than a smaller screen, I agree with you there. Let me give this one more shot. "your general sentiment is still that battery life is tied directly to physical size which, again stating my example of the iPhone SE, isn't the case" To break out the pieces, battery life is tied...to physical size...which, again...isn't the case. In other words, we do not agree. The iPhone SE is the exact same size as the iPhone 5S and it gets 30%+ better battery life purely through efficiency in components. To say high mAh results in long battery life is a misnomer that the G6 or V20 should be a clear reminder of. You also cannot equate physical size to battery capacity as energy density is not a universal measurement. marcusmarcus2 You are comparing different phones with different components. I agree with you that component efficiency has an effect on battery life. But... Let me give you one more shot. We will use your iPhone SE for this. If there were 2 versions of the SE. Both have the exact same components except one has a battery that is 1000 mAh larger than the other (thus making it slightly thicker), than the one with the larger battery would have more battery life, Thus the thicker one would have better battery life. That is what I am saying. I'm not comparing large phones to small phones. I'm saying if they had a larger battery in a phone with the exact same specs/components then the battery life would be better. That is all my point was. Do you not agree with that? EDIT: Yes, size of the battery may not increase with capacity due to density, but it usually will increase in size as it does increase in capacity, especially if it increases a lot. Geoff Johnson Again, you're talking about it being smaller. The iPhone SE gets good battery life because it has a 4" screen. The complaint is that phones are getting THINNER. Meaning that they still have 5.5-6" displays, but are thinner and translate to smaller batteries. james fuston Nope, not at all. The cell in the SE is about 50mAh bigger than the 5S (which is the exact same size). The 30%+ battery life improvement comes from more efficient components, not just their size. marcusmarcus2 Technically it is 2 dimensional train of thought. Also, if they increased it horizontally or vertically, then they would most likely have to increase the dimensions of the phone horizontally or vertically, thus changing the size of the screen or bezel. Increasing it thickness wise means they would not have to change the look of the of the front of the phone. Anywho, I'm only talking about thickness, not height, width, different components, different phones, not small phones or big phones. I'm talking just battery capacity, if all other components remain the same. Thickening the battery would add battery capacity without changing the over all look much at all. It could be any phone of your choosing. If adding a thicker/higher capacity battery to whatever 1 phone you want, that phone would have a longer battery life. Do you not agree with that logic? james fuston Thickness is commonly referred to as "depth" otherwise known as the Z-axis. That's one dimension. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8cba520372d511803190227fe949a5d698a79509804cb6ec7f8f2afbe25323c3.gif marcusmarcus2 you are right, that is 1 dimensional thinking. I read it wrong. And you are right I miss the joke as I do not see what is funny. I'm glad you know that thickness is depth, but when referring to phones, depth is commonly referred to as thickness. Anyways, You are the one that is applying 3 dimensional thinking when my general sentiment was only referring to 1 dimension, thus you pretty much accused me of referring it to all dimensions, when I was not. Now you are complaining I'm only applying it to 1 dimension. Which is it? https://68.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmbq2nuTrp1qcr8tuo1_500.gif In all seriousness though. I AM only referring to 1 dimension, thickness or depth (whichever you want to go by). Then they can fit a thicker battery in to increase its capacity without having to get a higher cost denser battery and without changing the over all look of the phone. Compare that to getting a battery that is larger in height and/or width, that phone would need to be designed with either a larger bezel (which would most likely make the phone look bad) or use a larger screen (which would most likely be less power efficient which would negate some of the extra battery capacity). james fuston > you are right I miss the joke as I do not see what is funny. Missing the joke and not seeing the joke as funny are two different things, but the joke wasn't really meant for you either way. > I'm glad you know that thickness is depth, but when referring to phones, depth is commonly referred to as thickness Yes, this is referred to as a "synonym" in the English language. > You are the one that is applying 3 dimensional thinking when my general sentiment was only referring to 1 dimension, thus you pretty much accused me of referring it to all dimensions I'm not sure you understand how to use "thus." To recap; you said the way to make battery life longer was to make phones thicker. I said you shouldn't conflate (that means mistakenly associate) thickness with battery life, as the physical size of a battery can also be increased with an adjustment in width or height of a phone. Not sure how you got me "[accusing you] of referring it to all dimensions" out of that. I can tell now that your argument originates from the fact that you don't like bezels and aren't crazy about large screens, but also want longer battery life. The reality here is that the majority of people disagree with you and would care significantly if their next phone was substantially thicker than their current phone, largely due to the fact that increased thickness makes curved-edged or "bezel less" phones significantly harder to hold. marcusmarcus2 >Yes, this is referred to as a "synonym" in the English language. Yes, we both agree on the fact it means the same. I just wasn't sure why you pointed out it is the same as depth when that seems to have been obvious to both of us. Maybe I did not use 'thus' correctly, but I'm sure you know what I meant and just don't want to address it. >To recap; you said the way to make battery life longer was to make phones thicker. I said you shouldn't conflate (that means mistakenly associate) thickness with battery life, as the physical size of a battery can also be increased with an adjustment in width or height of a phone. Not sure how you got me "[accusing you] of referring it to all dimensions" out of that. How do you not get you, you just repeated it? I was only referring to 1 dimension and you are trying to apply more dimensions to, which would change the over all look of the phone which would make people that like that phone not want that phone any more, whatever the phone was to begin with. Also, your recap is incorrect. I just said phones should be thicker for better battery life, meaning the thickness should come because of a thicker battery. Your response was address "smaller AND thinner phones" meaning you were applying other dimensions to the thickness which would make it a different phone with most likely different parts. >I can tell now that your argument originates from the fact that you don't like bezels and aren't crazy about large screens Half right and half wrong. I don't like bezels. I do like large screens though. I'm not referring to big phones or small phones. I'm refering to and phone compared to itself but thicker. You are the one comparing different size (width and height) phones. My point is you don't have to change the look of whatever phone you like if you just increase the thickness, whether that phone is large or small. >The reality here is that the majority of people disagree with you You sure about that? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/013a3bd18bb4ffc1eba1ece1d07e1fe9b6aeb2639380ca6c9fe00b40e043e452.png When a company releases 2 choices of the same phone with only the thickness/battery being different (same screen size, storage, RAM, processor, etc.) then we can see if people really do feel about thickness over battery life) Sk0ly You can't compare between OSs. There is a reason Android uses more battery, it features true multitasking and doesn't drastically limit background processes like iOS. Looks like Google is going a bit to the Apple approach going forward as devs can't be counted on to write decent code. james fuston Seeing as we're talking about physical dimensions and hardware specifications and they're effect on power draw, you absolutely can compare between operating systems. Processors aren't suddenly able to use more power than they're designed to use just because you've installed a different operating system. Jason B "Processors aren't suddenly able to use more power than they're designed to use just because you've installed a different operating system." Just to jump in: sure, they won't use more than their design power, but they can be used very inefficiently depending on OS. All modern mobile SoCs have hardware clock and power gating, but if software isn't allowing the SoC to idle properly or needs to use more CPU/GPU cycles to complete tasks versus other OS, yes, you will use more power as the clocks+voltage jump around instead of going into SoC's proper sleep mode for former or will hold onto higher clocks longer for latter. Apple makes both its hardware and software, so if you think that has no net effect, well ... Sk0ly Except the OS's operate in a completely different manner. Androids advantage being background functionality and iOS advantage being battery life. marcusmarcus2 What's this "We" stuff? You are talking about physical dimensionS and hardware specificationS. I'm talking about A physical dimension and the only hardware specification I'm talking about is the capacity of the battery resulting from it being thicker. You don't like @Sk0ly:disqus comparing different OS's when OS's have nothing to do with the point you are making? That's funny because you are doing the same thing to me, comparing different size (height and width) phones with different specs when that has nothing to do with the point I am making. marcusmarcus2 To be fair, @j_fuze:disqus was not comparing between OSs. He was comparing between different iOS devices. Specifically iPhone SE and iPhone 5S. You have to read a few of his comments to see what he was comparing. Either way, he missed my point by comparing different phones with different specs. My point was if ALL things being the same between 2 phones, except one had a thicker/larger capacity battery, that would give that thicker phone more battery life. I'm not sure why James is so hell bent on comparing different size phones with different specs/components. james fuston > James is so hell bent on comparing different size phones with different specs/components. lol, because I'm not interested in comparing different colors of the same phone? I didn't realize we were comparing battery life of hypothetical devices. marcusmarcus2 Colors? What are talking about now? Seriously, focus. >I didn't realize we were comparing battery life of hypothetical devices. I'm glad you started to finally read then and figured it out. Unfortunately, they will stay hypothetical until companies come out with devices with bigger batteries. james fuston Yes, colors. What other difference could there possibly be if the dimensions and specs of the phone are the same? You're 0/3 on understanding a point presented by someone else now. marcusmarcus2 >You're 0/3 on understanding a point presented by someone else now. haha. Lets address this part first because it is too funny. Not only can you not focus, you are delusional. You are the one who cannot get a point and you try to say I don't get a point. You are hilarious. I'm the OP of this thread of comments, you replied to me initially and you failed to understand the point. You have since replied numerous other times and have failed again and again to understand the point, each time bringing up different aspects of a phone that had nothing to do with my initial point. I get your points, but they have nothing to do with what my point is initially. Just because you can't understand that does not mean I don't get your point. >Yes, colors. What other difference could there possibly be if the dimensions and specs of the phone are the same Hmm. This is a tough one. Maybe battery capacity and additional thickness dues to extra battery capacity, you know, like I have said since the bigining and in every other comment since then. No other dimension and spec other than those, like I said each time. Talk about not understanding a point, you are the king of missing the point. https://media.giphy.com/media/14r9VMLSuQUzQs/giphy.gif Lets try to make this easy for you. Try to answer the following. I'll give you a little help by giving you the answers seeing as you have trouble catching the point of this original comment thread. Would a larger capacity battery give a phone more battery life compared to a smaller capacity battery, considering that is the only difference? Yes. Would increasing the thickness of a battery give it more capacity, considering that is the only difference? Yes. Would a thicker battery result in a thicker phone, considering that is the only difference? Yes. Are there other ways of increasing battery life? (This was not part of my original point, but since you keep adding it then I'll address it) Of course, like more optimized software or more efficient parts. Would including a larger capacity battery along with optimizing the software and more efficient parts give more battery life than optimized software and more efficient parts alone? Of course they would. Do more efficient parts have anything to do with your point you are trying to make? No What about color? Again, nothing to do with my point. What about box the phone comes in? No, but I thought I'd through that in there as a guess what James might try and distract with next. Do you get my point yet? My point is a larger capacity battery through making battery and the phone thicker would make any phone have more battery life. I really hope you get the point this time as you seem to be the only one who can't comprehend this. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/013a3bd18bb4ffc1eba1ece1d07e1fe9b6aeb2639380ca6c9fe00b40e043e452.png james fuston > Of course, like more optimized software or more efficient parts. Hey look! After another 5 paragraphs he comes around to the same conclusion as the "delusional" guy. I'm looking forward to reading the next essay, keep em coming. Oh and keep posting screenshots of the up/downvotes you've enabled, it's highly entertaining. marcusmarcus2 Not picking out only parts of my response and ignoring what you don't want to address. I have not come to the same conclusion as you. Like I said I got your point about more efficient parts. But like I said, that has nothing to do with the point I was making. I won't explain it again, I've done so enough and if you don't get it by now, then you are either a special kind of stupid, smart but to suborn to admit your wrong, or a troll who successfully trolled me. I'm done reading your lack of intelligent responses. I'll let Bobby finish talking to you because I am done. http://pa1.narvii.com/5800/e40bec66da3b149914b3323a0a2d5e07bc96bce2_hq.gif https://m.popkey.co/765dfc/Re7oQ.gif JD The SE wasn't thinner. Ryne Hager Give me a OnePlus with 5000mAh and I would be so happy. someone755 Give me a 4.7" phone like the og Moto X and I would be so happy. Neither of us are going to be happy, Ryne. Drakenoid OG Moto X updated for current year would be perfect for me. Vlad I never broke a single headphone since I first had a smartphone in 2011 until I got a 5" phone. Since then, I need to buy new ones if I use one daily for more than 2 weeks, simply because sitting or walking up on stairs will break the cable thanks to the length of the phone. Upsides: 5" phone with 4100 mAh battery => amazing. And it's also thin as heck. Downsides: breaks headphones, bends, need to root for decent software (Xiaomi). Gimme back my 4.5" 720p screen, Motorola. Kristian Ivanov I highly agree on the thin phones part. Bought a Huawei P10 2 days ago, for me, that thing is unusable without a case to make it a bit fatter. Karly Johnston If they fix idle battery drain that doesn't become an issue. marcusmarcus2 I'm not saying they should not fix battery drain. I'm saying if they fix battery drain AND add higher capacity battery (making phone a little thicker), they could increase battery life even more than just addressing one of them. So if fixing the battery drain adds another day and a thicker battery adds another day, you'd go from 1 day to 3 days instead of just 2 days from only fixing battery drain. Karly Johnston The battery life the current 625 phones are getting is where flagships need to be. That should be enough for anyone. marcusmarcus2 Everyone is not all the same. It may be enough for you. I'm saying, phones are beyond thin enough and could be thicker to increase battery life even more beyond what a 625 phone can do. Now, this is my opinion in regards to how I would like to use a phone. You are welcome to your own opinion. I'm not going to say what should be enough for anyone other than me. Karly Johnston The OEMs don't think that is what the vast majority of people need or want. Their target is a full day of battery life which is what most people are worried about. It isn't my opinion, it is the industry opinion of what the marketing priorities are. X-47B My phone has 4000 mAh battery, and it's 5.5-inch display. I easily get 2 days of battery even after heavy usage. Margaritas Ante Porcos Installed O on my 6p and battery still drains like a whore in a bukkake twelvesome. Google really can't do nothing at this point. Android is breaking to pieces. So many things needed to be fixed in O but instead Android's got even worse. That notification empty desert area of white grey nothingness kills me the most. Hate it really bad. The last Android I liked was 6th. catalysto Not sure what you're talking about. Battery life on my 6P with the new O is great. Maybe you have an aging battery? Margaritas Ante Porcos as long as your 6p works great, nothing else matters, right? Roy That's right. catalysto Just saying. My anecdotal evidence is as good as yours. And having poor battery life across multiple OS versions is a pretty strong indicator for a bad battery, don't ya think? In fact, I had the same problem with a previous 6P. iFeign Complain some more about your beta software Margaritas Ante Porcos It started with 7.1.2. Do you really need to be a btch when bad things happen to others? Roy For me everything goes smooth on my 6P on 7.1.2. so I need to complain that Android to good. The Wrath of Kahn If your 6P has shut down even once before reaching about 5% then you most likely have one of the defective batteries. I had to have mine replaced, but after that, it runs all day like a charm. ODP2 improved it, if anything. Margaritas Ante Porcos it was fine for a long time until I updated to 7.1.2. That update screwed the battery that was working superb all the time. DANA Try to do a factory reset, it fixes many problem for some user. Margaritas Ante Porcos It was one of the first things I did. Twice. Did not help. Paul_Werner Yeah you got to call Google (if you got yours from the Play Store). They've been replacing 6Ps with factory refurbished ones even out of warranty (source: it happened to me) Matthew Skalecki The update didn't screw up your battery. The battery was going to crap out on you regardless of which Android version you had. This happened to many people including me. Replacing the battery fixes the issue; reverting to a previous os does nothing. Zach Mauch Did you go through Google or a local shop? The Wrath of Kahn Unfortunately it was out of warranty, had a friend with the skills do it for me. JD I need more of this colorful imagery to describe simple everyday problems. mchalakov First off you are using a beta OS don't complain. Second thing is that battery drain comes mostly from the (bad)apps - if you watched the video or read the article you could understand. Third - I'm pretty sure you can go back to Marshmallow if you are so so so unhappy with Nougat or O. Jakst Really? Yesterday was my first day with Android O. I plugged my phone out at 7, and come home at midnight with 35 % battery left. I've never had that kind of battery life in my 6P before. So I've seen huge gains with this O preview. thereasoner The Android O beta I'm using is so slow to charge my Pixel today that it seems like that's what they tackled​....and not in a good way. iFeign Surprise, surprise, you're running BETA software. Smh. thereasoner Yeah I know and I'm sure it will get fixed between now and September. I'm just saying that the current difference in charge time is quite noticable at this point. AbdulB1 maybe they removed quick charge support in beta mattcoz Pixel never had quick charge. AbdulB1 hmm interesting. I thought it has qualcomm processor so it must have qc 3.0 too. Must be some proprietary stuff or qualcomm must be asking for more money to enable it. mattcoz Google is pushing the open USB-C power delivery standard. AbdulB1 Display screen eats up most of my battery. I can't see what google is doing will fix it somehow. We need different types of screens now. iFeign Uhh, it's as if you expect things to use NO battery at all. Infinite battery life! Of course using the screen, aka, using the phone, is going to be the largest proportionate power drain - no matter how fancy the screen tech. AbdulB1 battery tech has still not improved and nor did the screen tech. I can accept that the screen tech will remain same for a long time but as far as batteries are concerned they can be improved , made for longer number of recharge cycles but that hasn't caught up with the manufacturers yet. One thing which can be done is increasing the battery capacity but we all know this is not happening as phone manufactures think it will make phones bulky , add weight and in long term affect the sale of newer devices. Latheryin Multi day battery life will not happen until new battery tech comes around. With people needlessly having screen on times of 5+ hours there is no way to keep a battery charged for extended periods. Krzysztof Jozwik I average 2 hours of screen on time a day. Just because some use their phone 24/7 doesn't mean we all do. I have a job where I'm not on my phone, at home I have better screens to get info from. The phone is there when I need it. Your nonstop use case is not the norm. Latheryin As do I but that is not the norm. Might want to look at any forum about battery life and looking at screen on times. Most want and use 5+ hours. It's mainly the older generation like us that doesn't need it and are not on the device all the time. Krzysztof Jozwik Obviously the forums about battery life have people winning that they want 48 hours of screen on. That is not the norm. Sure, lots of people want that, most do not. Latheryin Most want more screen on time. Why do you think battery life is such an issue. disqusdeeznuts My Moto Z Play begs to differ. Motorola does it right with this phone. It has a good size battery (3510), an efficient processor, and runs smooth. It can be done, but for some reason, it just isn't a focus for a majority of manufacturers. Latheryin Well sure all the devices with that mid range chip and battery combo can get ok battery life. I could easily. Get 2 days out of my device and it only has a 3200 battery. It is not the oem. It's people. They need to spend less time look at their phone and more time living life. Which many are unprepared for. Cakefish I'm going the leaked Moto X4 continues that legacy onwards! Rod Ever heard of the Moto z Play, or Lenovo P2? Latheryin As already stated on that. The moto has a mid tear chip. As for the Lenovo, nope. Can't say I have, it's either not sold in my country or a mid low tier device that I wouldn't have noticed. Just looked. They both use the same mid tier chip. Also that does have a good battery. But that like the K1000 with a 10000 battery are the exception and seldom are they flagship quality. WarpspeedScp The Moto z does not have an SD 820 on it. Neither does the P2. It's very annoying that manufacturers can't give us something functional instead of eye-candy for once. Rod While it's not top of line sillicon, real world testes have proven that, for everyday tasks, there's virtually no difference between the S625 ans 821 WarpspeedScp Well, my phone has an SD 650, and dolphin emulator just about keeps up (wind waker and super smash Bros). On an 820, there would definitely be better results. Paul Troy I have a better idea. Get the hardware manufacturers to put a bigger battery in their devices. 💡 Taedirk If we could convince hardware manufacturers to do something useful, we wouldn't be on yet another revision to how Android updates the OS. Alex Yeah so this way the horrible wakelocks (that Android makes almost impossible to manage) will be less visible. Cakefish Why not both? Zach Mauch All I want to know is can they stop wakelocks. JD Same bullshit every year. I'll believe it when I see it. Unless Android O somehow allows me to download more mAh. Morten Ulv Are you trying to say Android battery life hasn't improved VASTLY over the years? JD Yep in fact it's regressed Morten Ulv I have no such issues. Better battery all across the board. JD What ever you're smoking pass that shit around Morten Ulv Your shit must be stronger than mine. browngeek I miss the days of my Xperia Z3 Lollipop and Stamina mode. Used to get 48 hours and 5-6 hours SOT. D13H4RD2L1V3 I hope this actually does something when the final build is out. I'm getting tired of hearing of every new battery improvement in a new version of Android only to have a wakelock pretty much make all of that moot. Dennis Ulijn I am on the Android O beta, and i must say that the information i get from it it really useful! I never could find the wakelocks because i'm not rooted, but now i can easily see what apps use up battery in the background. Awake meditation app was in use for 15 minutes (meditation) and active in the background for 1 hour (basically, ever since the meditation)! "Restrict background usage" to on, and we'll see what it brings tomorrow. PI this is interesting .... :) ,, Whats the current update Dennis Ulijn I'm in Europe so I just woke up. I'll let you know end of the day. Dennis Ulijn k. End of the day here. The apps (pocketcasts and aware) behaved nicely now. at 23%, which is not that great with 2 hours of screen on time and 32% and 5%of the battery used up by system and services respectively. (apps 32%, system 32%, services 5%, Cell standby 3%, idle 2%, bluetooth and wifi 0%) PI System 32% ,,, ???? Dennis Ulijn Yeah, last weeks i had the bug where system was using a lot of battery... I don't care right now, because i'm not expecting good battery life while on a beta. I did find a fix for system battery usage on Reddit though, which is to reset app preferences (which mostly only resets permissions and things like default apps. PI When in fist saw it ,,I was like WTH 32% but then it's beta software ,,so we kinda expect it . Yes per app battery usage section with foreground and background Info is really great . But I suspect google play services and Android os battery section will not be effective that much unless they show wahts making them to suck up battery . Sabin Bajracharya Meanwhile Google's own apps will somehow be able to bypass this restriction :D Michael Sørensen Google's own location services, Now cards, Chrome, etc. eats the most battery for me - even worse with location history on. How about fixing that first...? WarpspeedScp Try Firefox! Also, turn location off as soon as you can. mlm5em But with O, you can now turn off Background activity on an app specific basis. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/eaaaef5de863733535628a24f5b0d44f888ae3ff0cb89d1c8cffc0680083c526.png mattcoz Good to see there's an option to turn it off. Morten Ulv Very handy! IncCo Anything that improves the battery life is awesome John Monks I have concerns about this. There are some apps I *want* running in the background, but I don't want them filling up the notification shade. One example, Lightflow has to have a pointless notification in order to do the job I installed it to do. I know it's there, any consequences for my battery life are mine to live with. It would be OK if I could toggle a setting to permit a particular app to run a 'free running background service' silently but this is Google so I expect I'll have to put up with spam instead (and no, collapsed notifications are still notifications), or there will be a toggle that does nothing, like the 'ignore optimisation' setting that currently exists. Drakenoid There apparently is, check comments above, there's a screenshot. David Onter You can disable all notifications from an app, which removes the permanent notification. Cakefish It's about damn time. All hail Android O. AdamH So does it mean my phone will be useless? something_new Apple was right then Đức Thành I'm beginning to get excited again, even knowing that actually achieving this would take many years. Fidelator Allow us, the end user, to have absolute control over which apps can run in the background under certain conditions, I have disabled notifications on Facebook and Instagram yet they still have multiple persistent RAM hogging battery sucking services 100% of the time smeddy My next phone won't get a look-in without a 4000mah+ battery in it. Since Samsung dropped the removable battery, battery anxiety has crept back into my life. abc Multi-day battery life? Ha! I solved this over a decade ago. The key to long battery life is having an actual life. Have friends and family and an active social life. Don't be the loser who keeps fiddling with his phone every few mins, when everyone already knows you don't get any important messages. You'll be amazed how long your battery lasts when you aren't pulling out to jerk off on it every few mins. And for god's sake, at home, a cell phone should be no different than a landline. If you're watching videos or playing games on your 5" inch screen, you need to invest in a PC or console. Sk0ly Good for Google. Some apps, particularly Facebook and Facebook messenger run ALWAYS in the background, even when you haven't used the applications in days. In my opinion, this is just lazy coding and is likely due to Facebook's data mining. In comparison, Hangouts and Allo only run on demand. Android has always allowed developers freedom to responsibly code their apps to allow them to do more. This is recognition that this freedom has been abused and now developers have to be treated more similarly to how they are on iOS.

Leaks to the media are forbidden, and employees are encouraged to monitor their colleagues for leaks, according to the suit, which was filed in December by an anonymous ex-employee who claims they were unjustly fired. Contains a “stop leaks” email address We’re now seeing some of the first evidence to support those allegations. Earlier this month, attorneys for the plaintiffs entered an email as an exhibit in the case. The May 2016 document — one that has been previously quoted from in the lawsuit but not published in full — describes the result of an internal hunt for a leaker, mentioning a dedicated “stopleaks” internal email address, presumably directing to a team that the lawsuit claims is tasked with such investigations. The story behind the all-staff email starts with an incident from last year. In April, Recode published internal, employee-generated memes roasting Nest CEO Tony Fadell for a decision to shut down products from Revolv, a company acquired by Nest. In response to the criticism, Fadell gave a talk at the company’s weekly TGIF meeting and claimed Nest’s culture, another subject of criticism, was “improving.” The transcript from the talk was then also published by Recode. The internal email was sent a few weeks later, on May 6th, with the subject line “the recent leaks.” Written by Brian Katz, a former State Department special agent who now runs “investigations” at Google, it begins with a stern warning: “INTERNAL ONLY. REALLY.” “INTERNAL ONLY. REALLY.” Katz introduces himself as the head of the “stop leaks” team, a group of employees that the lawsuit claims is tasked with tracing the source of information that makes its way to the public. Katz writes that the company identified and fired the leaker for “their intentional disregard of confidentiality.” As a result of the leaks, Google stopped publishing transcripts of its TGIF talks, opting for a live stream instead. (The plaintiff who brought the suit says he was falsely accused by Katz of being the source of the leaks.) “We’ve all worked hard to create an environment where we can share information openly,” Katz writes. “Our culture relies on our ability to trust each other — we share a lot of confidential information, but we also commit to keeping it inside the company. We don’t want that to change.” He went on to encourage employees to share concerns with managers or through the human resources department, rather than airing them publicly. The Information noted in a story last year that, around the same time, Katz allegedly told employees in a webcast “to look to their left and look to their right,” saying one of those people may be leaking information. Katz ended by writing that the conversation had turned “less than civil” inside Google, and points to conversations on internal Google tools like Memegen as problems. “Memegen, Misc, Internal G+, and our many discussion groups are a big part of our culture — they keep us honest — but like any conversation amongst colleagues, we should keep it respectful.” “We should keep it respectful.” The lawsuit alleges that Google’s leaks policy covers essentially all company information and prohibits reasonable discussion about company activities. The stop leaks team is a primary object of criticism in the suit, which alleges that the team encourages employees to report any suspicious activity from their colleagues and streamlined the leak-reporting process with a dedicated URL. The email references a dedicated email address as well: “stopleaks@”. Google declined to elaborate on how the stop leaks team works. An attempt at emailing the group resulted in a bounce. A related case was also recently brought to the National Labor Relations Board. “We're very committed to an open internal culture, which means we frequently share with employees details of product launches and confidential business information,” a Google spokesperson told The Verge in a statement. “Transparency is a huge part of our culture. Our employee confidentiality requirements are designed to protect proprietary business information, while not preventing employees from disclosing information about terms and conditions of employment or workplace concerns." The full text of the email is copied below. Subject: The recent leaks From: Brian Katz To: Googlers INTERNAL ONLY. REALLY. Hi there. I’m Brian. I lead the Investigations team, which includes stopleaks@. At TGIF a few weeks back we promised an update on our investigation into some recent leaks, and here it is: We identified the people who leaked the TGIF transcript and memes. Because of their intentional disregard of confidentiality, they’ve been fired. We’ve all worked hard to create an environment where we can share information openly. Our culture relies on our ability to trust each other—we share a lot of confidential information, but we also commit to keeping it inside the company. We don’t want that to change. That said, we’ll be making some changes to TGIF to help keep the information shared internal-only, starting by no longer posting the written transcript to go/tgif. Instead, you’ll be able to watch a live stream, and for those who can’t tune in live, we’ll be offering the full video with Q&A. We’ll continue to share information internally because the vast majority of Googlers and Characters respect our culture and don’t leak—thank you for that. That commitment toward a common vision and goal makes this a special place to work. Please remember: whether malicious or unintentional, leaks damage our culture. Be aware of the company information you share and with whom you share it. If you’re considering sharing confidential information to a reporter—or to anyone externally—for the love of all that’s Googley, please reconsider! Not only could it cost you your job, but it also betrays the values that makes us a community. If you have concerns or disagreements, share them constructively through your manager, HRBP or go/saysomething. Which brings me to my final point: some of the recent discourse on Memegen and elsewhere within the company has been, shall we say, less than civil. Memegen, Misc, Internal G+ and our many discussion groups are a big part of our culture—they keep us honest—but like any conversation amongst colleagues, we should keep it respectful.

The push for data localization requirements—mandating that certain user data be kept within national borders—reflects an inaccurate understanding of the Internet. The reality is that we cannot have widespread data localization without making web services we rely on technically unviable. To understand why this is the case, we first have to answer a question at the heart of the Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA) and cross-border data transfer debate: Where is data located? It is effectively impossible for users of services like Facebook or Google’s Gmail to know where their data is stored. Yet in the MLA debate, courts have resolved tricky questions of jurisdiction through reasoning about the physical location of digital data. Take, for example, the Microsoft Ireland case. There, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the location of a Microsoft server in Ireland established that its data was extraterritorial, and thus was out of the reach of US law enforcement under ECPA. That may have led to a convenient outcome in the particular case, but the opinion does not accurately reflect how web services actually store their data.  Courts frequently use simplistic mental models for complex systems out of necessity. Legal reasoning does not require—nor could it likely accommodate—a completely faithful representation of how the Internet works. In the debate around data localization, however, over-simplification leads to some negative legal and public policy outcomes with wide-ranging consequences. And questions of how we should treat data aren’t only relevant to the data localization debate. How we cope with the transnational nature of the Internet will also impact issues ranging from intellectual property law to global anti-censorship efforts. That is why it is important to base the public conversation on a more sophisticated understanding of the nature of data storage. To that end, below is an overview of several of the ways in which well-developed web services might actually store your data across borders and why they do so. Consider a (fictional) email service that hosts your email and makes it accessible to you wherever you may be. Your emails would probably exist in multiple copies, which could be located in more than one country. Here are some possibilities for where your data might be stored: Your data might be stored in edge caches across borders One of the main pillars of web architecture is performance: applications need to get data to users as fast as is reasonably possible. One way to accomplish this is to keep a copy of select chunks of data in “edge caches.” Caches place the most in-demand content as close as possible to the end users who will want it, shortening the trip data has to take across the network. The cache network can strategically choose what data to include in cache based on changing demand and other factors. Thus, the expense of storing all data can be moved to a more centralized location while cheaper machines (possibly in different countries) can more quickly distribute data to their locale. Your data might be replicated for load balancing. Another principle driving the development web services is efficiency: there should be no wasted resources. To make more efficient use of their servers, a web service might replicate user data across multiple data centers in different regions. If one region sees more user activity and has trouble meeting demand, the network might instead route some user activity to a service’s replica in a different region. Your data might be ‘sharded’ across multiple machines in multiple datacenters. A web service may store millions of gigabytes of data. To do this, the web service stores data across many “shards,” with an individual computer responsible for holding a shard of data. An individual’s data can be split between any number of shards and distributed, copied, and backed up across multiple machines. This helps support a web service’s goals for performance and efficiency—load balancing, for instance, can be made even more efficient if the network chooses which “shards” of data need to be copied and distributed based on demand.   Your data might be backed up to multiple locations in case of failure. Most people have experienced the horrible realization you’ve accidentally deleted an important file. Imagine accidentally deleting data for several million customers. These sorts of disasters affect even the most mature web applications—in 2011, Gmail lost millions of users’ inboxes thanks to a software bug. Fortunately for those users, Google kept regular backups and so the data was never truly lost. This demonstrates how web services need to maintain a high degree of data integrity: the assurance that data will not be lost or corrupted over its lifetime. Emergencies caused by natural disaster or physical disruption to a data center require that backups be readily deployable to different data centers in different regions. Your data might be made accessible to engineers in different countries for maintenance and debugging. No software is perfectly written on the first go, and new issues will always pop up. This is a normal and expected part of software’s lifecycle. How well a web service functions will depend on how well engineers can diagnose and fix a problem. In some cases, this might mean engineers in one country have access to user data originating from another. Even if engineers only have access to activity logs—records of simple timestamps noting when a user accesses a service—those logs can constitute metadata.      Your data might be processed in batches at a central location, to add features like search or artificial intelligence. Fetching an email from your inbox or writing a new post on a friend’s social media page are relatively cheap jobs for the web service to perform. Relative to those basic operations, adding more advanced features like the ability to search your inbox or use artificial intelligence to build spam filters are more costly. Fortunately, the service might not need to update the feature immediately with every user action. A web service can save crucial resources by processing data in batches on a set schedule. These operations don’t necessarily need to have the same redundancy as other, more user-visible processes, so data can be copied to one single location that is responsible for all of the expensive work. That location might be any one of the data centers that the service operates around the world.      Your data might be used to generate “derived data.” In many cases derived data requires the same protections as the private data it came from—if an AI could extract your opinion about everyone you’ve spoken to from your text messages, you’d likely consider that information highly sensitive and requiring a level of protection similar to the texts themselves. In other cases, aggregate statistics derived from data could be useful to share between engineers or release publicly without revealing anything about any individuals—if an AI only noted how many people you text regularly, without recording their names or your name, you’d probably view that as less sensitive information than the content of the original texts. Deciding when derived data is sufficiently “safe” can be a difficult problem. The overarching point is that data can live ephemerally, in many copies and in many places. Some of our most important Internet applications, from search functions to communications, rely on those places being across a national border. It is an immense challenge to design laws and policies that best serve the interests of users and law enforcement without compromising on the principles that power the Internet. We will only be able to meet that challenge, however, by developing a more complete understanding of how our data actually exists in the world.

The app is available for download on the Google Play Store to help people locate public toilets near their location. The app was published by the Ministry of Urban Development and it uses Google Maps to mark out the nearby toilets in your vicinity. According to a report by Times of India, the government has planned to launch the ‘Mission Toilet Locator; to Agra, Ajmer, Ahmedabad, Bhilai Nagar, Bhubaneswar, Dhanbad, Greater Mumbai, Guwahati, Jammu, Kochi, Vijayawada, and Greater Bengaluru. The department of Urban development has suggested the municipal bodies tie up with Quality Council of India to map all the community and public toilets in a given area under control by any given municipal body. The government started this in New Delhi and regions around the national capital. The report detailed that about 50-60 people use the app on a regular basis in NCR and the initiative has pushed the municipality to map about 5,162 toilets across the region. As a part of the announcement, the ministry has plans to start a reward scheme to push users to use the feedback option along with ratings on the toilets in order to increase the popularity of the app. As soon as you launch the app, you are presented with the option to search toilet for ‘Female’ or ‘Male’ in addition to the options to search any toilet anywhere and one where you can submit a new entry using the ‘Submit Toilet’. When you take any of the buttons to search the public toilets, the app pushes you to a Google map where you can see all the pins corresponding to toilets. When you tap on the pin on the map, the app tells you if the location has been verified along with a reference photo. One thing to note here is that the photo is not always a proper image of the location. Instead, it looks like a random image pulled from the cloud to match the location. Each screen of the public toilet shows the average score of the toilet based on parameters like ‘Hygiene’, ‘Infrastructure’, ‘Safety’, ‘Seat Type’, and ‘if the toilet is paid’ or free. You also get the fields that will inform if the toilet is ‘disabled friendly’, has ‘Sanitary Pad Disposal’. Other details include ‘Opening Hours’, Seats available including directions and a button to provide feedback about that particular toilet.

You can get our headlines via email as well, or follow us on Twitter. Last week was marked by significant changes rolled out on Google AdWords, one affecting the Ad Rank thresholds, and the other concerning Quality Scores. New Google AdWords Ad Rank Thresholds Google announced the rollout of new Ad Rank thresholds since the beginning of the month, but it implemented the changes slowly. The Ad Rank is the value used to determine the position of an ad on a search or web page and is calculated using your bid amount, the components of Quality Score (expected clickthrough rate, ad relevance, and landing page experience), and the expected impact of extensions and other ad formats. With the new changes implemented to Ad Rank thresholds this month, bids will carry more weight and Ad Rank thresholds can also be based on the meaning of the query. The changes have already impacted many AdWords users, while others can notice them closer to the end of the month, or beginning in June. To clarify, the two changes are significant, especially with an official statement from Google that confirms that bids will carry a larger weight in Ad Rank than in the past for some queries: While ad quality continues to play a very important role in the Ad Rank calculation, this particular improvement adjusts the thresholds such that bids may carry a larger weight in Ad Rank than in the past for some queries. You may notice that on these queries, even though you continue to have high keyword Quality Scores, that you experience a change in your core ad metrics. Since the change also means that CPCs could increase, advertisers should now monitor and adjust their bid terms to ensure that they are not paying more than what they are willing to pay and value a click at. Another possible side-effect of the changes is a lower impression volume for keywords with bids that are not high enough. Improved Quality Score Reporting The second important change rolled out last week by Google AdWords concerns the reporting interface, which now includes an easier way to get more visibility for the keyword Quality Score components. Google has added three status columns for Quality Score – “Exp. CTR,” “Ad Relevance” and “Landing Page Exper,” – and four for the historical Quality Score – “Qual. Score (hist.),” “Landing page exper. (hist.),” ““Ad relevance (hist.),” and “Exp. CTR (hist.).” According to Google, there are two important things to know about these columns: they reflect the last known score for the date range you selected, and they show daily values that reflect what your scores were at the end of each day if you apply the “Day” segment to your Keyword reports. Since Quality Scores are important to improve Ad quality, you can always see the official guide provided by Google to understand how to use them to improve your ad performance in AdWords. Quiet Conversion Import Update Besides new Ad Rank thresholds and improved Quality Score reporting, Google has also quietly announced updates to the Conversion Import feature: Starting today, you can schedule these uploads to save time and reduce errors. AdWords will automatically upload offline conversions from clicks and calls into individual or manager accounts on a daily or weekly basis. The new features are explained in detail in this guide that shows how to import conversions from ad clicks into Google AdWords. Google has just admitted that its AdWords product is too complicated for small business owners who have little digital marketing experience. “Over the last decade, AdWords has gone from a very simple platform to a very complicated platform for someone who is a busy small business owner, and for someone who isn’t a digital marketer, let alone an expert in AdWords,” said Google product marketing manager Duncan McGrath cited by AdNews. Therefore, Google now offers free training to help business owners boost their digital marketing skills via a new online training tool, aptly named Digital Garage.

York but migrated to San Francisco where he got to know local Native American communities. After enrolling at San Francisco State University, Oakes helped create a Native American studies department, one of the first in the country.  His academic and social connections, coupled with the revolutionary atmosphere of the late 1960s, led Oakes to launch some of the most radical direct action ever undertaken by Native American activists.  In 1969, he led a group of students and Native Americans to the site of Alcatraz prison, in the San Francisco Bay. Oakes swam to the island when the boats were stopped.  Read more Pope appears to back Native Americans over Dakota Access Pipeline Native Americans vow to stop Trump building border wall on their land Chris Hemsworth apologises for cultural appropriation Native Americans most likely ethnic group to be killed by police The activists turned Alcatraz into a sanctuary for Native Americans and made it a focal point for protest against the Indian termination policy. Dating back to the 1940s, the policy enacted a number of measures aimed at integrating the Native American population into mainstream society. But Oakes and his fellow protesters argued for self -determination. Oakes’ group released the Alcatraz Proclamation, announcing the intention to turn the island into an Indian cultural centre and offered to buy the land for $24 in cloth and beads – which European colonisers bought Manhattan Island for in 1626.   "We invite the United States to acknowledge the justice of our claim,” Oakes said a message to the San Francisco Department of the Interior.   “The choice now lies with the leaders of the American government - to use violence upon us as before to remove us from our Great Spirit's land, or to institute a real change in its dealing with the American Indian.  “We do not fear your threat to charge us with crimes on our land. We and all other oppressed peoples would welcome spectacle of proof before the world of your title by genocide. Nevertheless, we seek peace.” The protesters, numbering around 400 at their peak, stayed on Alcatraz for more than a year. They drew significant media attention and fuelled the debate surrounding Native American rights. A Native American tribe's fight to preserve its language The occupation had fizzled out by 1971 but was credited with being the inspiration of at least 200 more acts of Native American protest. Most crucially, the peaceful activism was credited with changing the US government’s position on Indian termination and President Richard Nixon spoke in support of self-determination.  The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act was passed in 1975, which allowed federal agencies to work with recognised Native American tribes.  After leaving Alcatraz, Oakes continued his activism and was frequently arrested and suffered violence. He was shot and killed after an argument with a California YMCA leader in 1972. His killer, Michael Morgan, was acquitted of murder.  More about: Richard Oakes Google Doodle Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

Such decisions are having an impact on the lives of people in domains as diverse as digital media, advertising, finance, credit, employment, education and criminal sentencing. Marketers and companies need to understand that we are entering into a new generation of optimizing websites for search engines. While many principles and tactics stay the same in search engine optimization, we cannot deny the current path of technological breakthroughs, such as the introduction of complex machine learning algorithm systems like Google’s RankBrain.      To the non-search engineer, CTO or data scientist, the concept of RankBrain may seem technical and intimidating, but it is one that chief marketing officers for brands — not just technically savvy search marketers — will have to understand to be competitive in 2017 and beyond.   An intro to Google’s RankBrain RankBrain is a machine learning artificial narrow intelligence system that was introduced to the public in 2015.  Bloomberg was the first news publication in mainstream media to break the news about Google’s newest search ranking factor in an interview with Greg Corrado, a senior research scientist at Google. RankBrain is designed to better understand the meaning behind the words a person uses and types into his or her search engine because 15 percent of queries per day had never been seen by Google before.This concept is explained in this article detailing their algorithm’s ability to better understand word relationships. You will definitely want to learn more about this technology!    The rise of mobile: A primary driver of RankBrain’s existence? Voice search has been on the rise for a while now. Mary Meeker, a partner at the VC firm, Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers, states in this presentation that voiced search is up 7 fold since 2010. RankBrain deals well with the conversational long-tail queries that are common to voice search today. Mobile search behavior has been a game changer when it comes to queries with AI assistants: Siri, Google Now, Cortana as well as those coming from voice assistants such as Alexa and Google Home.   A rundown of what RankBrain actually does RankBrain was designed to better analyze the language of websites in Google’s index in order to apply that analysis to a particular search query. Because there are a number of core algorithms that exist to parse queries in Google’s search pages, it is RankBrain’s job to learn what mixture of these core algorithms can best be applied to each type of search result. By better understanding the search query, Google’s search has a more precise ability to match users with websites and pages. The purpose is to better understand the meaning of content and the intent behind a search query. Once it understands the intent, it can presumably apply appropriate Google algorithm signals that deserve the most weight to determine what results to show based on the search query.    A search result will bring up websites that include a mixture of hundreds of algorithm ranking factors used to determine the relevance of the page in relation to the search query. Along with the ability to better understand concepts on a web page, RankBrain also allows for a better understanding of the association between multiple queries, such as: “Where is the Eiffel Tower?” Followed by: “How tall is it?”       How does RankBrain actually learn? During an SMX West Expo conference, speakers Marcus Tober, founder of Searchmetrics, and  Eric Enge, CEO of Stone Temple consulting, respectively, shared examples of RankBrain working in action. One of the studies showed how RankBrain better interpreted the relationships between words. This can include the use of stop words in a search query (“the,” “and,” without,” etc) — words that were historically ignored previously by Google but are sometimes of a major importance to fully understanding the meaning or intent behind a person’s search query. It’s also able to parse patterns between searches that are seemingly unconnected, to understand how those searches are similar to each other. Let’s say we use the example of the comedy TV series “The Office”.  This is an example of a search that would be taken out of context without reading and incorporating the all-important “the” word, if it was indeed typed into to the search box.       There are several theories on how RankBrain may use data to learn to show the best results for a query. It is also completely possible that a person’s engagement with the search result might be a factor in how RankBrain determines the relevancy of a result, as Rand Fishkin founder of Moz, suggests in a keynote last July 2016.   How RankBrain works with other Google algorithm ranking signals In 2016, a Googler named Andrey Lipattsev confirmed that RankBrain was now among it’s top three ranking signals for search, along with links and content as the other two most influential factors. This is an important concept for marketers and business owners to understand. Google clearly stated that the signals that the SEO marketing world believes to be important still matter quite a lot: quality content and authoritative links.     While the content on a website and its links are both vital to determining meaning and relevance, RankBrain works in partnership by assisting the Google search engine to better determine if a website is the most relevant to the searchers implied intent–based on signals and algorithms. According to Aleh Barysevich the CMO of Link-Assistant.com, there are seven ways Google rewrites search queries behind the scenes to produce better search results.      The impact RankBrain has for big brands      With machine learning, RankBrain learns associations over time. This means that if a brand becomes associated with a certain product, the queries about that product may lead to more branded search results. Because Google tends to favor or give preference to bigger brands for a variety of reasons, with RankBrain metrics like a site’s engagement rate, mentions of the brand across multiple social media sites, and so on, may further enhance partiality. This may also happen in spite of the fact that some larger brands may have a weaker link profile than some other competitor websites in their respective industry. What RankBrain means for your SEO and online marketing strategy OK, now for some action items … SEO and your content     First, let’s discuss content.  For many marketers, it’s actually just business as usual. You should examine your content to ensure it provides the best, most comprehensive answers to satisfy a particular query, whether you are trying to rank for an informational page or selling a product or service. RankBrain is a machine learning system, but it still needs input from your site. It’s working better to understand and make connections about concepts. For example, we can give RankBrain credit for understanding a page is about baseball even if the words, and only the words, “New York Yankees” and “Boston Red Sox” are present on a page.    One of the goals of SEO is to better help search engines understand what your content is about. It is still crucial that you make sure to include the keywords that are relevant and important to your company on your website’s pages. This includes “stemming” keywords, (if you took the word “search” and made additional keywords from the word search such as “searcher,” “searches,” “searching,” “searched,” and “searchable.”) while using prefix, suffix, or pluralization, synonyms and natural word variations to help make connections between ideas. Another example of this could be the word “mercury.” You could use this word “mercury” 12 times on a page, but if you forget to use the word “planet”, then the search engine may be confused about the subject of the page. Is it an element, a car, insurance or something else?    This is when the time for exploring and implementing  structured data markup, which helps search engines to better make connections as to what a page is about more easily, is essential. Bruce Clay, a veteran SEO marketer, discusses how SEO professionals should approach RankBrain in this podcast. Remember, the little things matter as they always have in Search Engine Optimization       You will want to continue to pay attention to make sure your search results listings stand out from the crowd if one of your marketing goals includes ranking on the first page.  That means ensuring each web page has unique meta data in addition to exploring other ways you can make your page stand out; using schema markup and useful, engaging content. Another question to ask: once people land on your website, is it helping them move farther along in their journey by offering up related content that explores a topic/product/service or more?  This can be done by siloing your content to create subject themes around around the key terms that will help your website rank on search results pages for your business.     RankBrain and digital marketing strategies I mentioned earlier that RankBrain will likely favor big brands. So what happens if you are a startup or small business? Now is the time to start thinking about improving your online marketing team and strategy, if you haven’t already.  While it’s a great idea to have a robust and thorough SEO and content marketing strategy, it’s never a great idea to put all of your eggs or marketing budget in one basket, so to speak.     In the era of RankBrain, even though the basics of search engine optimization that marketers know and love are still crucial, it is suggested that you also think of creative ways to grab that SERP real estate. That could mean if you are not in the upper echelon of well known brands online, you could consider supplementing your search marketing strategy with PPC advertising.   Also, Google is pushing organic results down even further in SERPs – when it  took away the right rail of ads and added a fourth ad now being shown for commercial and transactional queries, we see this in action. In December 2016 Google rolled out a new desktop search interface that mimics its modular mobile user interface. To those unfamiliar with the mobile design, the new desktop design actually looks like it and consists of a tabular design that highlights search features in boxes. This is essentially imitating the desktop Knowledge Graph real estate, which appears in the right-hand rail of the search engine result page and allows for featured elements to frequently display Twitter carousels, People Also Search For, and Top Stories (vertical and horizontal design) modules.     Critical technical SEO issues to examine   In the age of RankBrain, these foundational technical SEO issues still matter. Prioritizing an SEO to do list is is important for business. Focus your resources on SEO work that is actually going to improve rankings, increase clicks and drive revenue. Most companies should focus on engagement SEO work, but technical tasks can’t be ignored completely — especially if you have major problems.  Some issues you may want to tackle as soon as possible include blocked resources/crawl issues which will limit the amount of traffic coming into your website. Site is not optimized for mobile, and its performance or the speed of your site on both desktop and mobile will limit the amount of people that stay on your website to visit more pages. This, will in turn, decrease the relevance on google’s search engines. RankBrain is not the end of SEO but it is changing it If your company is worried about how RankBrain impacts SEO, there is quite possibly more to worry about than you may think. RankBrain is search results relevance on steroids.  Simply put, you must improve your content relevancy to match the query intent. Yes, SEO best practices are crucial to traffic, and rankings are competitive than ever.    But, it’s also important for startups to focus their content marketing strategies, from a macro and micro level, and how your website’s content (as a whole) helps to answer the questions your audience is looking for.   And don’t forget to supplement your digital marketing strategy with things like paid search, remarketing social and other channels to keep your brand top of mind. Technology is advancing rapidly, and buyer expectations and demands are evolving alongside these innovations. Today’s critical SEO priorities will be tomorrow’s outdated practices, because search engines are designed to cater to people, and people change.  A few SEO takeaways to keep in mind: Each competitive keyword environment will need to be examined on its own Most sites will need to stay niche to avoid misclassification Each site should mimic the structure and composition of their respective top sites in that niche Do you have insights on the impact of RankBrain on search rankings?  I want to know.

Here’s Where to Stash Your Cash Instead Home | Companies Tags: Google | Developers | Amazon | Digital | Assistant | Race Google Woos Developers to Catch Amazon in Digital Assistant Race (AP/Getty) Monday, 22 May 2017 08:08 AM Close  More ways to share... Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Here is Google's vision for the future of computing: As you drive home from work, you tell your car, "Ok, Google," triggering the company's Assistant. You order food, the digital helper handles the transaction and makes sure it's ready when you arrive. Right now, Amazon.com Inc. and its Alexa digital assistant are closer to realizing that goal, having cut a deal this year with Ford Motor Co. to let drivers search, shop and control other devices by voice from their vehicles. That's just one of the ways Amazon is outpacing Google in the race to weave a digital assistant into consumers' lives. What's more, Amazon has a leading e-commerce business well suited to this emerging world, with a massive delivery network to speed orders to shoppers -- an area where Google has struggled. Amazon's Echo connected speakers, launched in 2014, have given Alexa an early lead by reaching millions of users at home, while Google's rival Home device only came out late last year.  “Amazon kind of fell into this lead in 2014 because it wanted to sell more things to people in new ways," said Brian Roemmele, founder of ReadMultiplex.com, a website about voice-based commerce and computing. "Google is trying to evolve its online search experience into devices that have a voice. That philosophy limits its ability to really go after Amazon.” Central to Alexa's appeal: Amazon has thousands of voice-based apps up and running, far out-numbering Google's tally. The Alphabet Inc. unit used its I/O developer conference this week to try to narrow Amazon's lead by wooing skilled programmers capable of building tools and services that can make the Google Assistant more useful. The company stressed experience with mobile software and the millions of things it already understands on the web and in the real world. Vehicle and payment functions were rolled out to expand the Assistant beyond the more simple ways people use it now, such as setting alarms and playing music.  "A lot of what you need to get done is transactional," said Gummi Hafsteinsson, product director for the Assistant. "We take care of all the nitty-gritty hard parts." Technology giants think voice-based computing could be the next big platform, after mobile. The company that wins will have the most users talking to devices and the most developers creating new experiences. Google’s Assistant has only been active for six months. That’s a major disadvantage when it comes to creating that virtuous circle of users and developers.  It tried to get that circle spinning faster at I/O. About 7,000 conference attendees were offered a free Google Home speaker and $700 worth of credits for its cloud-computing service. The company is hoping these developers will use both to build and test new voice-based apps (known as Actions on Google) for the company’s Assistant.  It needs to fire up these developers, many of whom have already been building for Amazon's Alexa system. By February, there were 10,000 Alexa Skills -- the equivalent of an app for Amazon's voice-based system -- up from 1,000 in June 2016. Bloomberg News counted fewer than 300 Actions for Google’s Assistant built by outside developers on Friday afternoon. Last June, the voice-based technology wasn't available publicly yet. Neither company is anywhere close to the dream of a naturally conversant machine. But Google is leaning on its expertise in artificial intelligence fields like voice recognition and automated language understanding to push it ahead if or when this form of human-computer interaction takes off. It also hopes long experience collecting and organizing information from the web will provide a useful fallback solution when the company’s Assistant lacks a specific Action to address user questions. Take cooking recipes, an early use for hands-free speakers. By November, Alexa could talk budding home chefs through more than 60,000 recipes. That came from a Skills integration with the cooking app Allrecipes. The latest Echo Look device, with a screen, is particularly well suited to voice-based kitchen use because it can show people recipes, as well as tell them about ingredients and cooking steps. Bloomberg News asked Google’s Assistant to talk to Allrecipes on Friday afternoon, and the digital helper sent web links rather than an integrated voice-based Action. However, the Assistant has access to 45,000 recipe websites that have already been marked up with special code that lets Google’s software read out ingredients and other related information, Hafsteinsson said. "Google has better understanding. It has been working on AI much longer,"said Patricia Carando, a mobile developer attending the I/O conference. She's been working on an Alexa Skill, but she was learning how to create an Action for Google's Assistant during coding classes at the event on Thursday. Eventually, consumers will pick one digital assistant "and stick with it," pushing developers to mostly build on that platform, she added.  A deep concern for Google is that more people will stick with Amazon or a potential device from other competitors like Apple Inc. That's behind Google's rush to integrate its Assistant with any and all connected devices. At I/O, Google executives unveiled Home Graph, a system for connecting and controlling smart home devices by speaking to the Assistant. There are about 70 outside companies working with Google to sync things like dishwashers, fridges and light bulbs to the voice-based platform, including GE Appliances, Osram Lighting and Leviton, the internet giant said. Even so, Amazon is making the most of its earlier start. The day before I/O began, a new Amazon program emerged for outside developers working with the company’s Alexa digital assistant, which controls its Echo devices and a rising number of other gadgets. If users talk a lot to a developer’s Alexa Skill, then Amazon will send a reward of cold hard cash, according to note posted Amazon’s Alexa developer website. On Amazon’s website, there are hundreds of home devices already for sale that work with Alexa, made by roughly 30 companies such as Samsung Electronics Co., Philips and Wink. Google is taking pains to show how easy it is to use its tools. During an I/O demo in front of a packed crowd of developers on Thursday, a Google engineer built a simple Action for the Assistant that turned on a set of virtual light bulbs, then turned them green, by voice. The company is working on “What it means to be a washing machine,” the engineer said, to giggles from some in the audience. Google is also working on what it means to be an assistant. Organizing web information and supporting apps is familiar terrain. Discerning what consumers want to hear from their voice-based devices is new territory. At an another panel during the week, Google engineers showed developers a list of criteria the company uses to decide what Actions and other data to surface within its new Assistant world. Those included questions about whether end users had to repeat requests, learned something or "LOL" (laughed out loud). The company rarely exposes such specific guidelines. It's famously secretive about these types of criteria when it comes to search results, to avoid website developers gaming the system and ruining the experience. The fact that it's being so open, shows how eager it is to lure a new army of outside voice-based developers. "Please, please think about those things," Valerie Nygaard, a Google product manager, told the audience. "These are the questions we ask ourselves." © Copyright 2017 Bloomberg News.

TechRadar claims that it received an intriguing chart from a trusted source, which is allegedly showing off internal testing of app load times for the OnePlus 5, and compares them to the results of the Galaxy S8 and the Google Pixel XL. Now, if you’re interested in checking out the aforementioned chart, you’ll find it right below this article. As you can see, the OnePlus 5 beats both the Galaxy S8 and the Google Pixel XL. For example, the device 12 seconds, on average, to fully open Asphalt 8: Airborne game. For comparison’s sake, it takes 16 seconds, on average, for the Galaxy S8 to do the same thing, and 26 seconds for the Google Pixel XL. There are three additional game tests that you can check out down below, if you’re interested. Now, as far as apps concerned, there are quite a few apps listed down below, including Facebook, Gmail. Google Maps, Spotify, Twitter, etc. The OnePlus 5 managed to fully open Facebook in 3.9 seconds (on average), while the Galaxy S8 managed to do the same in 4.7 seconds (on average). It took the Google Pixel XL 5.1 seconds to do the same thing, once again, these are average times. Neither of the iPhone-branded phones are listed here, which is a shame, but it makes sense considering we’re looking at a completely different OS here. If you’d like to find out more, check out the provided chart down below. The OnePlus 5 will launch during the summer, OnePlus already confirmed that, and chances are it will arrive next month, considering that its predecessor was announced back in June 2016. The OnePlus 5 is expected to sport a dual camera setup on the back, and it will be fueled by the Snapdragon 835 64-bit octa-core SoC. The phone will probably ship with a 5.5-inch fullHD or QHD AMOLED display, and it will pack in 6GB or 8GB of RAM. Android 7.1.1 Nougat will come pre-installed on the device, and on top of it, you’ll get the company’s custom skin, OxygenOS. That’s pretty much all the info that we have at the moment, do keep in mind these specs are not confirmed or anything of the sort, they were mentioned in a number of rumors, however, and the phone also leaked a number of times thus far.

The move comes amid growing criticism of the controversial plans to recoup the cost of social care from people's estates, over £100,000 and make pensioners shoulder the burden of increasing care costs. The party performed badly in a slew of polls over the weekend, following the announcement at last week's Conservative manifesto launch. U-turn coming on social care. There will be a cap. Read today's @EveningStandard for the details— George Osborne (@George_Osborne) May 22, 2017 The former chancellor George Osborne, now Evening Standard editor, has suggested Mrs May's team is preparing for a u-turn on the policy. In a tweet he said: "U-turn coming on social care. There will be a cap. Read today's @EveningStandard for the details." In an attempt to combat the criticism, Theresa May's team has paid Google to make sure a link to their website with the words "The so-called 'dementia tax' - Get the real facts" comes up at the top when users search "dementia tax". Labour has also bought an ad on Google titled 'Tory Dementia Tax - What You Need to Know", which links through to the party's website. It was featured underneath the Conservative advert. Image: Google advertisements bought by Labour and the Tories Mrs May has been warned her plans could hit a roadblock because of poor-performing councils, already failing to make arrangements for people to pay for care after their deaths that were introduced in 2015. According to research by the insurance firm Royal London, people in some areas are struggling to strike a deal with councils over deferring payment for their care until their death. Freedom of Information responses from 140 local councils showed a huge difference in how councils performed across the country on coming to agreements with those about payment for residential care. Ten of the 140 councils had failed to strike even one social care deal - while 47 councils said they had made fewer than 10 agreements. In other areas councils had made hundreds of deals. Video: Watch: The key points from Tory manifesto launch :: Conservative manifesto: What it says, what it means But former Lib Dem pensions minister Steve Webb, who is now director of policy at Royal London, described the current system as "very shaky" and said the Government would need to overhaul it. Otherwise, he added, it could not be expected to cope with the demands under the so-called "dementia tax" Mrs May plans to introduce. He said: "It is clear that there is already a lottery as to whether people facing significant care costs can exercise their legal right to defer their payments under the existing system. "The Government will need to investigate very quickly why the present system is not working properly, otherwise there is a danger of building a new system on very shaky foundations." :: Labour manifesto: What it says, what it means Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson refused to be drawn on suggestions Mrs May's team had failed to consult Cabinet ministers over plans. Image: Nick Timothy, seen with fellow May adviser Fiona Hill, reportedly put the measures in the Tory manifesto at the last minute It was claimed Mrs May's chief of staff, Nick Timothy, included the measures at the last minute. Mr Johnson suggested on Peston on Sunday that the proposals could be altered. He said: "I do understand people's reservation and the questions that people are asking about some of the detail of this but the broad thrust is right, and, as the Prime Minister said there will be a consultation on getting it right." He would not be drawn on whether he had been consulted on the plans before the manifesto launch. According to the Liberal Democrats, the social care changes could see 90% of English homes eligible to be put on the market to cover the cost of treatment costs. Tim Farron told Sky News at the weekend: "If you or your loved one has or will get dementia, they are coming for you." Video: Jeremy Corbyn criticises Conservative manifesto The Liberal Democrats are seeking to increase spending on the NHS and social care by putting an extra 1p on income tax. Mr Farron has said he will be looking for the support of medical charities to help oppose the plans, including Alzheimer's Research UK, whose president is now former Prime Minister David Cameron. :: Liberal Democrats' manifesto: What it says, what it means The Liberal Democrats have set up a "Scrap the dementia tax" petition on their website.

Last week at Google’s annual developer conference, the company presented its vision for how it expects its users—more than a billion people—to interact with technology in the coming years. And for the most part, it didn’t involve typing into a search box. Instead, Google’s brass spent its time onstage touting the company’s speech recognition skills and showing off Google Lens, a new computer vision technology that essentially turns your phone’s camera into a search engine. Technology has once again reached an inflection point. For years, smartphones relied on hardware keyboards, a holdover from the early days of cell phones. Then came multitouch. Spurred by the wonders of the first smartphone screens, people swiped, typed, and pinched. Now, the way we engage with our phones is changing once again thanks to AI. Snapping a photo works as well, if not better, than writing a descriptive sentence in a search box. Casually chatting with Google Assistant, the company’s omnipresent virtual helper, gets results as fast, if not faster, than opening Chrome and navigating from there. The upshot, as Google CEO Sundar Pichai explained, is that we’re increasingly interacting with our computers in more natural and emotive ways, which could mean using your keyboard a lot less. Ask the people who build your technology, and they’ll tell you: The camera is the new keyboard. The catchy phrase is becoming something of an industry-wide mantra to describe the constant march toward more visual forms of communication. Just look at Snapchat. The company bet its business on the fact that people would rather trade pictures than strings of words. The idea proved so compelling that Facebook and Instagram unabashedly developed their own versions of the feature. “The camera has already become a pervasive form of communication,” says Roman Kalantari, the head creative technologist at the design studio Fjord. “But what’s the next step after that?” For Facebook and Snapchat, it was fun-house mirror effects and goofy augmented reality overlays—ways of building on top of photos that you simply can’t with text. Meanwhile, Google took a decidedly more utilitarian approach with Lens, turning the camera into an input device much like the keyboard itself. Point your camera at a tree, and it’ll tell you the variety. Snap a pic of the new restaurant on your block, and it’ll pull up the menu and hours, even help you book a reservation. Perhaps the single most effective demonstration of the technology was also its dullest—focus the lens on a router’s SKU and password, and Google’s image recognition will scan the information, pass it along to your Android phone, and automatically log you into the network. This simplicity is a big deal. No longer does finding information require typing into a search box. Suddenly the world, in all its complexity, can be understood just by aiming your camera at something. Google isn’t the only company buying into this vision of the future. Amazon’s Fire Phone from 2014 enabled image-based search, which meant you could point the camera at a book or a box of cereal and have the item shipped to you instantly via Amazon Prime. Earlier this year, Pinterest launched the beta version of Lens, a tool that allows users to take a photo of an object in the real world and surface related objects on the Pinterest platform. “We’re getting to the point where using your camera to discover new ideas is as fast and easy as typing,” says Albert Pereta, a creative lead at Pinterest, who led the development at Lens. Translation: Words can be hard, and it often works better to show than to tell. It’s easier to find the mid-century modern chair with a mahogany leather seat you’re looking for when you can share what it looks like, rather than typing a string of precise keywords. “With a camera, you can complete the task by taking a photo or video of the thing,” explains Gierad Laput, who studies human computer interaction at Carnegie Mellon. “Whereas with a keyboard, you complete this task by typing a description of the thing. You have to come up with the right description and type them accordingly.” The caveat, of course, is that the image recognition needs to be accurate in order to work. You have agency when you type something into a search box—you can delete, revise, retype. But with a camera, the devices decides what you’re looking at and, even more crucially, assumes what information you want to see in return. The good (or potentially creepy) news is that with every photo taken, search query typed, and command spoken, Google learns more about you, which means over time your results grow increasingly accurate. With its deep trove of knowledge in hand, Google seems determined to smooth out the remaining rough edges of technology. It’ll probably still be a while before the keyboard goes extinct, but with every shot you take on your camera, it’s getting one step closer. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

As such, it can be confusing if you want to upgrade your old machine or dive into the operating system for the first time. How do you know what to look out for? What are the key specs and features? If you’re about to hit the shops, read this article first. I’m going to introduce you to seven features your next Chromebook must have. 1. Android Apps Compatibility Google had been talking about bringing Android apps to Chromebooks for a long time, and in early 2017, we finally saw the dream become a reality All New Chromebooks Will Run Android Apps All New Chromebooks Will Run Android Apps Any new Chromebooks launched in 2017 and beyond will ship with access to the Google Play Store included as standard without the need for an update. Read More . The first Chromebook that supported Android apps fresh “out of the box” was the Samsung Chromebook Plus, but an increasing number of pre-existing models are now being brought onboard. They include popular machines such as the Dell Chromebook 13 (7310), the HP Chromebook 14 G4, and the Lenovo N23 Chromebook. On its website, Google lists more than 80 devices that’ll eventually be able to install the Google Play Store. Android apps on Chromebooks bring a lot of benefits. You can access more productivity tools, more offline content, and more games. At the moment, a lot of the developers still haven’t optimized their apps for the platform, but it’s clear the momentum is building.

And guess how much storage it has? That’s right, 16 GB. It confuses me, therefore, why some expensive models are still shipping with only 16 GB all this time later. I appreciate Chromebooks are “online” devices Chromebooks Don't Work Offline? Debunking the Myths Chromebooks Don't Work Offline? Debunking the Myths One of the biggest criticisms aimed at Google's Chromebooks is that they are online-only machines – ergo, no Internet, no point. How true is this statement? Read More and integrate seamlessly with Google Drive, but saving files in the cloud isn’t always practical or desirable. In 2017, you shouldn’t settle for less than 32 GB of storage capacity. The HP Chromebook 13 G1 comes with 32 GB, as does the Acer Chromebook 14. The ASUS Chromebook Flip comes with a mammoth 64 GB. At the other end of the scale, the Lenovo N22 only comes with 16 GB. Avoid it. ASUS Chromebook Flip C302CA-DHM4 12.5-Inch Touchscreen Intel Core m3 with 64GB storage and 4GB RAM ASUS Chromebook Flip C302CA-DHM4 12.5-Inch Touchscreen Intel Core m3 with 64GB storage and 4GB RAM The flexible 360 degree hinge and 12.5" Full-HD touchscreen lets you use the C302 in tablet or laptop mode. Buy Now At Amazon $499.00 3. Tablet Mode Tablets are another category of device that have been losing market share to Chromebooks in the last 18 months. It seems consumers prefer a lightweight fully-fledged browser rather than locked-down ecosystem and range of apps. However, their shape has always put them at a slight disadvantage. It’s simply not as comfortable to sit with a laptop on your knee as it is to hold a 10-inch display. Image Credit: 1stockphotopro via Shutterstock But all that’s about to change. The latest class of Chromebooks now offer 180-degree barrel hinges. They allow the screen to fold back on itself, giving you a tablet-esque user experience. The Samsung Chromebook Pro (and its little brother, the Plus) both offer tablet screens. If the $450 price tag is too steep for you, check out the Dell Chromebook 11 for $225. 4. 4 GB of RAM I’m going to refer back to my three-and-a-half-year-old HP Chromebook. It has 2 GB of RAM, and while it still performs most tasks with aplomb, it definitely struggles when several browser tabs are open The 10 Best Extensions For Chrome Tab Management The 10 Best Extensions For Chrome Tab Management If you’re a multi-tasker like me, you love tabs.

It even lags when I’m using TweetDeck and have a few live searches running at once. Therefore, it raises the question: Why are we still seeing some manufacturers release 2 GB models in 2017? Avoid them like the plague. You need a machine with 4 GB of RAM, especially now using your Chromebook is about to get even more resource intensive with the arrival of Android apps. Once again, the current best-in-class Samsung Chromebook Pro has 4 GB, as do the Acer Chromebook R11, the HP Chromebook 14, and the Toshiba Chromebook 2. Depending how much you’re willing to spend, you can even bump the HP Chromebook 13 as high as 16 GB. Toshiba Chromebook 2, 13.3", Intel Celeron 3215U, 4GB RAM, 16GB SSD (Certified Refurbished) Toshiba Chromebook 2, 13.3", Intel Celeron 3215U, 4GB RAM, 16GB SSD (Certified Refurbished) This Certified Refurbished product is tested & certified by Toshiba to look and work like-new.

Ideally, therefore, they should also be lightweight. You want to be able to throw it in your bag and forget it’s there, not feel like you’ve done a gym workout How To Workout Without Going To The Gym How To Workout Without Going To The Gym It's hard enough setting aside time for actual exercise, but throw in your commute and it can add up to a lot of wasted time. Try these effective workouts without ever leaving your home. Read More by the time you get home. The weights of the different models vary wildly. For example, the Acer Chromebook 15 tips the scales at a porky 4.85 pounds (2.2 kg). Sure, it boasts a larger-than-most 15.6-inch HD screen, but such high-end specs almost defeat the purpose of a Chromebook. Several models weigh less than 2.5 pounds (1.1 kg). They include the ASUS Chromebook Flip, HP Chromebook 11, and ASUS Chromebook 11. 6. Ports Not all Chromebooks are created equal — some have a wider selection of ports. Sure, you’ll always have a couple of USBs ports and an HDMI point, but what else is available? When you’re looking for your next device, you need to make sure it has either USB Type-C connections What Can You Shove In a USB C Port? What Can You Shove In a USB C Port?

SD card compatibility is the more common of the two. The ASUS Chromebook Flip has two USB-C ports and an SD card slot, while the HP Chromebook 13 G1 only has one USB-C port to accompany its SD card slot.

Battery Life Google touts Chromebooks as being perfect for students and people on-the-go. Therefore, a long battery life is an essential feature. To be fair to ChromeOS, it’s always been quite light on battery consumption. But that doesn’t mean there aren’t some laptops that are better than others. The aforementioned Samsung Chromebook Pro and Plus both come with a 5,140 mAh battery that the company claims will last up to seven hours of continuous usage. ASUS goes one better with its Flip model, boasting nine hours. On the other hand, the HP Chromebook 13‘s QHD+ display eats through power. You’ll be lucky to see more than four hours. Which Features Are Important to You? I’ve shown you seven essential features and specs you need to pay attention to if you’re about to hit the shops for a new Chromebook. However, these might not be the most important things you consider. I want to know what you’re going to be looking in your next Chromebook. What features are must-have and which features don’t matter to you?

It has replaced a 15 inch MacBook Pro, and I have to admit I was a little worried. However, having the Android and Chrome OS has made it an easy transfer. I would agree with all the points in this article, this combo is the way forward and if you're not requiring full professional use design, photo/video suites you're going to be fine. I plumped for the 8gb RAM just to be safe and have a 128gb stick that has USB-C and typical type A, and I have everything I could need. I love it and am a total convert. Reply Jerry Suppan May 22, 2017 at 1:11 pm Even 32GB storage is insufficient IMHO. Since we now deal with the era of Android apps compatibility on a Chromebook, that means Android apps are also downloadable and usable locally. That converts to storage space requirement. 32GB storage will just fill up too quickly for my comfort. (I have both a 64GB and 256GB storage capacity smartphone, so, I know the space will be appreciated). There should be minimally 64GB of storage, preferably 128GB with this in mind. And for related reasons, RAM should also be at least 4GB and perhaps 8GB or 16GB is not so far-fetched either. I am thinking in terms of using the Chromebook as a convertible, tablet-type Android device and not just only a Chromebook function. Reply Frank John May 22, 2017 at 1:04 pm Screen size. Miracast.

Investors weren't happy. Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) May 22, 2017 at 7:11AM Snap's (NYSE:SNAP) initial public offering earlier this year was met with huge excitement from investors, launching the company to a lofty valuation. Last week, the Snapchat operator reported its first-ever quarterly earnings -- and the stock plummeted over 20% as a result. On this episode of Industry Focus: Tech, Motley Fool analyst Dylan Lewis and senior tech specialist Evan Niu dive into the earnings report, and explain what major red flags had so many investors exiting their positions. Listen in to find out the most important numbers in terms of growth rates, revenue, and monthly active users, and what they mean for the company; a few critical issues that Snap isn't addressing; how the Spectacles are performing and where they fit into the company's strategy; the less-than-inspiring way that CEO Evan Spiegel is responding to competitive threats from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB); and more. A full transcript follows the video. This video was recorded on May 12, 2017. Dylan Lewis: Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. It's Friday, May 12, and we finally got our hands on Snap's first earnings release. I'm your host, Dylan Lewis, and I'm joined on Skype by Evan Niu. Evan, how's it going? Evan Niu: Pretty good, I'm having way too much fun watching Snap tank today, I have to admit. Lewis: You do have a little bit of options action with Snap, right? Niu: Right, I am short, small a short position with some puts. So, I'm enjoying the action today. Lewis: Even without having any skin in the game, so to speak, I will say this was the earnings report I was most looking forward to this quarter. We got a look at Snap's prospectus a couple months back, but you talked about, when a company goes public, the idea that very often, it's when it's in the company's best interest, or current management's best interest to go public. The numbers look maybe as good as they're going to for a while until they figure out monetization. I certainly thought that was the case with Snap. It seems like you probably did, too. Niu: Yeah. Generally speaking, I consider IPOs a marketing event because you go on this road show, you're drumming up interest. And you have to have some numbers, of course, to back it up, but it's really about how you spin numbers and how you tell your story. And if you have a good road show, you have a good IPO, you raise a bunch of money. But now, we're at the first public earnings release, and I think that's really the wake-up call for any company that goes public recently, and it's the first big test. Now that we're public, because, obviously, earnings releases are a regular quarterly thing, and now you get to follow the company on an ongoing basis, it's not just this big marketing event like the IPO was. Lewis: Yeah, the honeymoon period is certainly over for Snap. Following the release, shares were down 20%. And that's really because the numbers didn't look all that great. Revenue came in at just under $150 million, which was up from $39 million a year ago previous quarter, and the Street was looking for somewhere in the neighborhood of the high $150 [million]-$160 million range. Net loss came in at $2.2 billion, which was up from $100 million a year ago, a large chunk of that was from stock-based compensation. We're going to touch on that later. Shares fell 20%. I think one of the big scary things, also, looking at the report, was what was going on with user numbers. Niu: Right. Of course, with any social media company, user metrics are extremely important. Everyone is all too familiar with how Twitter did not do well with putting up user numbers, and that's really why Twitter as a stock has lagged. They also haven't really been putting up strong ad revenue numbers, either. So, that's kind of where Snap now finds itself. We'd already seen in the prospectus that daily active user growth was decelerating, especially if you look at it on a sequential basis, which is what I like to do with social media companies. Yeah, they're up to 166 million. It's better this quarter than, probably, the past couple of quarters. But it was also shy of what people expected. Lewis: Yeah, you can break out what's going on with users a couple different ways. You said sequentially or year over year. Quarter to quarter, the company did add more daily actives this quarter than they did the previous quarter, so, some cheers there. But if you look on the year-over-year growth rates, they're decelerating. You go back a couple quarters, and the company was posting growth rates of 65%, 62%, 48%, and now they're at 36% year over year. It seems like they're getting a little bit closer, a little bit closer, a little bit closer to the ceiling in terms of user growth, and what that overall audience might look like, and that's naturally what's going to scare investors quite a bit. They've talked a little bit in the past about how they're not huge on overall user numbers, they're really big on engagement, they like to highlight what was going on in terms of user spend with time on the platform. And they highlighted that people are spending 30 minutes per day on average on the platform last quarter. And they said the metric was up. I don't really remember them giving a firm number in the past when we were looking at the prospectus, Evan, do you? Niu: I don't remember. They might have, but I can't recall off the top of my head. Lewis: Yeah, I was looking back and I saw a range of 25-30 minutes when they released all their information for the IPO. So, it's hard to know exactly how high that's up. If management is saying that it's trending up, that's nice. But it's not like it was a massive improvement, based on, at least, what we know going back to the prospectus. Niu: Speaking on user numbers, Evan Spiegel had this really weird comment on the call about how, "Our rivals are doing what we call growth hacking," which is when you send people notifications, and prod people into using the app and getting their friends to use the app. He was kind of saying this in a bad way, like, "We're not going to resort to those types of methods to try and grow user numbers." But, it's like, why is that a bad thing? Everything these companies do, all of them, is meant to increase engagement on the platform. Why is it a bad thing when a company is experimenting in different ways to try to get their users engaged, get their users to grow their own network of friends on the platform? Those, to me, are just regular things that a company should be doing to increase engagement. Yet, Evan Spiegel is trying to downplay, and say, "We're not going to do that." It was a really bizarre way to frame that, when you would think that a company like Snap that's trying very hard to grow users would consider experimenting with some of those types of things. It was just a weird comment to make. Lewis: And, also, to put the platform under a microscope for a minute, I don't know if you use the messaging side of Snapchat at all, or if you're more on the story side with your posts, but if you wind up actually sending each other messages to friends back and forth on the platform, you get a notification that your friend is typing a message. Are there any other platforms where you get that notification? That is absolutely a push to get people playing on the platform or, and to give people a heads up. Niu: Yeah, exactly. I wasn't aware of that because I don't really use the platform. That's kind of crazy, because that sounds exactly like what he's talking about, which is sending you little notifications and prodding you to stay in the app, stay engaged. Lewis: And I see that and I don't need that. Just tell me when I actually have the message. Niu: [laughs] Yeah, that's a weird notification, that someone is typing. Of course, a lot of time on messaging platforms, you see when people are typing. But a notification that someone is typing does seem kind of annoying. Lewis: Yeah. Something else to keep an eye on with what's going on with user growth is, all of it's coming from North America and Europe. You look at the company's rest of world segment -- those are the three ways they break it out right now -- and that's been relatively flat over the last three quarters. It's like 39 million, 39 million, 40 million. I think some of that is connectivity. Obviously, developing parts of the world don't necessarily have access to the same broadband cell service. And, obviously, Snap is a very visual and data-heavy app. But, I think that's problematic long-term for the company.  Niu: Yeah. I think that's a conscious decision on their part, because they're only focused on the U.S. and Europe. There's been all of these headlines you've probably seen about, Evan Spiegel called India as being a poor country, and doesn't want to expand into it. Of course, that didn't go over very well with users in those countries. But, the underlying business rationale for why you might not want to expand in those countries is, ad monetization in those countries is very low. It is, financially, very hard to make money there. But, of course, saying the country is poor is a horrible way to go about it. But, if you look at their business, they don't really scale well to emerging markets because of their use of third-party cloud infrastructure, which we'll touch on in a minute. Their costs are very high, and the monetization is very low. So, if they were to expand into emerging markets, it accelerates their losses, because they get pinched by really poor ad rates and really high costs. So, financially, they don't really have that much of a choice, because they would bleed out a ton of money if they tried. Lewis: Yeah. I guess I would argue that they're still in the phase of business where it's OK to be creating losses, because if you're building the daily active user base, people are going to ignore that for a long time. If you can get into some of these emerging markets and really be rooted there, you're putting yourself in a better long-term position. Whereas, right now, Facebook is eating their lunch in a lot of these developing markets, and they're just dropping a lot of features that Snap has in its app that they really developed and popularized. I think by the time Snap gets to some of those markets, people are going to be like, "I can already do this on Messenger or Instagram." Niu: Yeah, I definitely think it's a short-sighted thing, to ignore these emerging markets. Lewis: But you also think the company's hosting strategy as well is short-sighted, as well. This is something that a lot of companies haven't done. Rather than investing in their own infrastructure, whether it's building out their own data centers, or doing co-located facilities for their servers, Snap is relying entirely on third-party cloud infrastructure providers. That's kind of new. I know you've been a skeptic of that in the past. Niu: Yeah, it's a very unique strategy. If you look at it from Snap's perspective, the benefits they're saying of why they do it this way is, I think one is reliability and resilience, because AWS and Google Ad are extremely powerful. That way, they can ensure the services are up-and-running. If you remember Twitter in the early days, it had outages all the time because they had so much trouble scaling because people were coming to the service so quickly, it was overwhelming Twitter's own servers, and their in-house infrastructure that caused constant outages. So, by relying on AWS and Google Cloud, Snap can avoid that, because those clouds are so strong that it's really unlikely they're going to be hit with an outage. Of course, it could happen. But there's much less risk of that happening. The other piece of it is, they're trying to save all this money on capital expenditures. Capital expenditures last quarter were very low. They're always low for Snap, because that's just how they approach their cloud stuff. It was $18 million or something.  On the call, they mentioned, "We estimate that using a capital-light approach has saved us billions of dollars in capital expenditures," which is true, but if you turn around, they've also committed to spending $3 billion at AWS and Google Cloud over the next five years, combined. You're not really saving that money, you're still spending it, you're just, instead of spending money on capital expenditures and having that asset on your balance sheet where you depreciate over time and it's your infrastructure, now you're relying completely on these third parties. Those are variable costs. That's going to be a really big challenge for scaling, because those costs are going to scale, too. They did renegotiate their contract pricing during the quarter with both AWS and Google Cloud. They did say that lower contract pricing did help their cost structure a little bit. And if you're looking at it from Amazon or Google's perspective, Snap is a huge customer in the space. They're probably one of the biggest customers out there with these types of spending commitments. These are the two biggest cloud providers, so of course they're going to be bidding pretty aggressively and competing for this contract, and I'm sure Snap is pitting them against each other and really leveraging that in negotiating. So, yeah, they are getting some better pricing now. But, it just doesn't seem like a good long-term strategy. If you really want to have good long-term growth, you just build infrastructure yourself, eat the costs up front, but then you can scale so much better. Lewis: Yeah. You talked about it being variable and somewhat subjective to pricing negotiations. This most recent quarter, hosting costs ate up 70% of revenue, and that's actually down from the last couple quarters where it was up near 80% a few quarters ago.  Niu: A year ago, it was like 160% -- hosting costs exceeded revenue a year ago. Lewis: Yeah, I'm not sure how much further that's going to fall. We might continue to see it move down into the high 60s, or something like that. But, I don't know how much lower that floor is going to be. But, it really speaks to how their cost structure is very different than a Facebook, a company that has decided to build out, what, seven data centers at this point? Niu: Nine. Lewis: Nine? Wow. So, rather than have that fixed cost, like you said, as they have more people using the platform, and more people using the platform longer, the cost for them doing that is going to continue to go up, which is something that could be good or bad, it depends on your outlook and what you value for the business. Niu: It gives them more flexibility if things start heading down, if people stop using the platform and users start abandoning Snapchat. Then it's better, in that situation, because you're not stuck with all this infrastructure you have built, and your costs will scale down. But, obviously, Snap is hoping things go up, in which case, it's really hard. They're getting squeezed by these costs, and I think it's really short-sighted. But to be fair, they have hinted that they might pursue their own infrastructure at some point in the future. But, they were very vague about it in the prospectus. They didn't specify timing, and, of course, they do have spending commitments for five-plus years. So it doesn't seem like if they do it on their own, it would be within the next five years, at least. Lewis: Yeah. And vague has been a consistent theme in a lot of the communication we've gotten from Snap's management. Evan, I know that we had a couple little other interesting tidbits we wanted to touch on. Why don't we start with Spectacles? I know leading up to their IPO, one of the biggest things I was wondering was, what is this doing for their business? This is hardware, we think of them as a software and platform play. Are they getting anything meaningful there? What your take on what's going on? Niu: It's weird because Spectacles seems to be the basis for why they rebranded themselves a camera company, because now they make a camera product. But, we've talked about this before, it's a strange identity to try to carve out for yourself. But, they have started disclosing a little bit more detail about Spectacles. They said last quarter, Spectacles revenue was about $8 million. At the same time, they've also broken down their costs in more detail, which is very useful for investors. We talked about the hosting costs, which they broke out. But, if you look at this other category, other cost to revenue was about $20 million, and I'm pretty sure that is predominantly related to Spectacles, if you look at the language in their filing. If you think about it, that's operational, the only other real part it could be. The revenue, $8 million, and the cost was $20 million, so obviously they're losing about $12 million in the quarter on Spectacles on the hardware side. And that includes building these machines and having inventory costs, and all the physical logistics associated with physically selling a product, which, this is the first time they've ever done that. So, they're probably losing a bunch of money upfront. Hardware is, of course, naturally very hard to do as a sustainable business in long term, where you can have product cycles and get people to constantly buy your product. But, in terms of engagement, I think it's very interesting because it doesn't seem like Spectacles do a whole lot in terms of engagement, either. On the call, Spiegel said there have been 5 million Snaps created via Spectacles to date. Spectacles launched in November. At the same time, they said in the first quarter there were three billion Snaps per day created. So, throughout the whole quarter, we're talking about 270 billion Snaps that are created on the platform. Less than 5 million of that comes from Spectacles. If you do the math, that's 0.002% of Snaps created -- less than that because that's just in the quarter. So, it just begs the question, why are you doing this? No one is using these things in a meaningful way. It's literally a rounding error at this point, 0.002%. Who cares about that? Lewis: Yeah, that's basically a footnote, right? Niu: Yeah. You're losing money, you're putting all this effort into it, you're probably hiring a bunch of people to work on these things and whatever comes next in the product pipeline on hardware. And they're not doing anything in terms of engagement, users aren't really using them, and now you're jumping into this space of trying to develop camera hardware, which, the other 99.998% of usage is coming from smartphone cameras. Smartphone cameras are amazing these days. There's no way that Snap is going to come out with a better camera than Apple or Samsung. So, why? It makes no sense to me. They're losing money, they're not helping engagement, and there's no way they can actually compete. Lewis: Yeah, when I first saw them doing this, I thought they were really smart in creating a lot of buzz every time that they launched a new location, they would drop these vending machines that had a limited number of Spectacles in the middle of these remote spots, or in city areas. They wound up getting a ton of press for it. I thought it was a really brilliant marketing play, and it built a lot of awareness for the company. But there's a big difference between building buzz and being a viable product segment. I don't think that investors should expect a whole lot to be coming from the Spectacles or the hardware segment any time soon, if ever, just because, like you ran through the economics right there, and they're really not that great for the business. Niu: Yeah. I definitely agree that the launch was a very successful marketing campaign, because everyone was buzzing about it. There was a lot of hype around these things. So, I definitely agree that the event was successful as a marketing event. But, now that we're starting to get some numbers out of the company, in terms of usage and financials, it just doesn't seem worth it to me. Lewis: One of the other things that popped out to me looking at the report was, I mentioned earlier, net loss came in at $2.2 billion. Non-GAAP EBITDA (earnings before interest before taxes, depreciation, and amortization), which backs out stock-based compensation, came in at just under $200 million loss. I think it's worth emphasizing that EBITDA backs out stock-based compensation, because stock-based compensation was huge for Snap in this most recent quarter. Niu: Yeah. Out of the total net loss of $2.2 billion, $2 billion of that was stock-based compensation. It's not uncommon for companies that go public, because what usually happens is, a lot of the private stock that's been given out when the company is private, there's these performance conditions that can only get met when the company goes public. So, what that does is triggers a ton of vesting and huge expenses are now recognized. So, that's what happened here. But, I think in this case, it's a huge number. For context, when Facebook went public, their first public earnings release, they reported $1.3 billion in stock-based compensation. That's less than what Snap just reported. And when Facebook went public, it was a massive company already, and they IPO-ed at over a $100 billion market cap, and they had 700 [million]-800 million monthly active users -- they were much bigger at that time, and their stock-based comp was less than what Snap just put up. Lewis: I think one thing that's worth emphasizing with this argument, though, is one grant in particular ate up one-third of that total $2 billion. Niu: Yeah. That's another red flag to me. As soon as Snap went public, Evan Spiegel got a giant bonus for taking the company public. Those bonuses aren't unheard of in themselves. But what's alarming is the magnitude of it. The CEO grant says he gets an extra 3% of shares outstanding once they go public. So, it turned out to be about $625 [million]-$640 million, that Snap recognized all upfront, immediately after the IPO. And that's just for him, which, as you mentioned, is about a third of the $2 billion total for the quarter. But, what is so weird about it is this award vested immediately, but they pay it out to him in quarterly installments over three years. It's considered an unsecured liability, like, you are an unsecured creditor with this. But then, why did it vest? Because it vested all up front, they ate this giant cost up front. And because it vested up front, there's no service requirements. Obviously, the point of having vesting time frames is to retain employees and make sure they stick around. But they just gave him all this up front, and he could leave the company right now if he wanted to. Lewis: And he would retain all those shares. Niu: Yeah, he still gets to keep them, and they just pay them out over three years. But they're vested, they're his. Lewis: Yeah. Evan, I know you wrote a whole fool.com piece about this. Listeners, if you want to see the numbers broken down on paper rather than having them told to you, email into the show, industryfocus@fool.com. I'm happy to send it along. I think the thing that you need to remember with this is, the type of grant that we see here, one, it's not particularly great for the business, because you're recognizing a ton of stock-based compensation at once. And it's also not particularly great if you're a long-term investor who wants the CEO to stick around and have skin in the game and a vested interest in the long-term outcome of the business. Like you said, he can walk whenever now. Niu: Yeah. I don't understand why they wouldn't have it vest over time. Not only would that spread out the cost of the grant, but it also has retention effects. Not that I'm a huge fan of Evan Spiegel as a product visionary, per se, to begin with. But, on principle from a governance perspective, it just doesn't seem right. Combined with all the other governance red flags we've seen with this company, like no voting and things like that, it just doesn't seem like Snap cares about its investors. It seems like they just want to enrich themselves, particularly Evan Spiegel. Lewis: Yeah. And frankly, a lot of the comments from management seem to strike that tone with me, too. A couple in particular that really stood out -- one from Spiegel, "We're kind of famous for not giving guidance on product pipeline." We talk about transparency and having shareholders' best interest in mind, there wasn't any guidance anywhere. We didn't really get much in terms of product, we didn't get much in terms of financial guidance. I understand that it's a high-growth business, and it's obviously going to take some time to settle out. I think we were bound to have a big reaction either way to the results, because no one knew what to expect, really. But, it feels a lot like this is a company being run by Spiegel and Murphy that have all the controls and don't have to answer to anybody, and that's because they don't. That's exactly what this is. The way it's all set up, they can do whatever they want. Niu: Yeah. The whole voting structure, it's very literally saying, "We want your money but not your opinion." [laughs] And that's never good, in any context. Just to touch on what you're saying, his comments on the call had this air of arrogance, like, "Oh, we don't care." Of course, they don't want to give any hints about what they have in the product, because they don't want Facebook to copy them, [laughs] of course, until they release it, and then Facebook will just copy them later. But, yeah, they came off as very smug and arrogant, despite the fact that investors are clearly not impressed. I think heading into the results, the chances of the stock jumping were very remote, because of the valuation. There's so much priced into the valuation at the IPO, which we've talked about on previous shows. The bar is very high already. Any small miss, you're going to get punished for. They missed quite a bit on several fronts. So, it's not really surprising to me that the stock dropped as much as it did, because there's no way it could have lived up to the valuation. Lewis: In fairness, this is something we've seen time and time again. This happened with Twitter, this happened with Facebook. A lot of expectations coming out of the IPO, and then the next morning wake-up where you're like, "Oh, we need to run a real business here that's making money and put up solid numbers quarter to quarter." I think this is part of the reason why, even if you do think Snap is a long-term stock that you want to own, you want to buy -- or really, for that matter, any recently public stock -- it might make sense to wait a few quarters and see how the numbers shake out first. Because management knows a lot more than you do when it's time to go public, in terms of the trajectory of the business. And also, when you're pre-monetization the way that Snap was, you're not exactly sure what those revenue streams are going to look like, or what the final business is really going to become. Niu: Exactly. That supports my theory that they're just trying to cash out. Some people argue that they went public prematurely relative to -- usually, you want to have some more solid financial numbers before you go public. They were just now starting to grow the ad business, which is why the growth rate in the first quarter was so huge, because they're coming off such a tiny base. So, there was some concern, like, why are they going public now, versus waiting until they have some better results in their track record? Which, of course, makes it better to justify to investors. But, I think the whole thing is, they just want to cash out as soon as they can, and get rich. Lewis: Yeah. In some ways, I can't blame them, right? [laughs] Evan, anything else you want to hit? Niu: No. I hope they keep trending lower. Lewis: [laughs] Listeners, if you want to check out any more of our coverage, Evan's done an awesome job looking at some of the stuff from earnings for Snap.

Google is working on a new payment API for the web and mobile Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 10:05am PDTMay 18, 2017 18 Plus 1 on G+ 49 Share on Facebook 57 Share on Twitter Total Shares124 Google News Videos Manually entering your payment information every time you check out on a new site (or app) is incredibly annoying. In fact, Google says virtual shopping carts are abandoned twice as often on mobile for that very reason. To help alleviate this problem, it looks like Google is working on a PayPal-like payment API that works on desktop and mobile. Google already allows apps and websites to use Android Pay, but that is obviously limited to Android devices. This API will allow any app or website to use the payment information stored in your Google account, instead of your Android Pay wallet. In summary, the new API is like Google's version of PayPal Checkout. The new API will soon be used in Google Assistant, allowing you to quickly send money to your contacts with simple voice commands (skip to about 14 minutes in the above video for a demo). Google has tried having its own payment system a few times - first with Google Checkout, then with the Google Wallet API for digital goods.

PayPal is razor focused in what they want with a long-term roadmap. Logan Graham Can't wait for this to be deprecated in a year and a half! Morten Ulv Can't wait for you guys to get tired of the same old comments. Logan Graham I'm usually not one to say that, but haven't all of their previous web checkout solutions been shutdown?

Ailín Ó’S Source? antonio cesar Android Police itself, there was an article about that a few days ago Ailín Ó’S You're absolutely right. My mistake! HBK008 Personally I will research but "abandon" all shopping on my phone since I have a computer as an option... no improvements to phone payments will change that. Jan-Lk Else I wonder what Google wants for that. Because using PayPal isn't that cheap... Abhilash Bingi 'Pay with Google' and 'Android Pay'. In true Google fashion, two of everything! :D But can't really blame them. Android Pay can't work for iOS users and users on the web, so they have to do something about it. John Galt This is not new. This is web html standards and Edge already supports it. Chrome for Android also supports the API which is what gets you Android Pay in the browser. Google is just finally enabling it on desktops. Really nothing to see here and they didn't invent anything. Corbin Davenport You're talking about the Payment Request API, which is indeed a web standard that Chrome already supports: http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/02/chrome-56-adds-official-web-bluetooth-api-support-new-tab-page-changes-experimental-webvr-apk-download/#Payment_Request_API_Android_Pay This is something entirely different (and probably proprietary), as it uses your Google account for checkout as opposed to your Android Pay wallet (which is what the paymentRequest API on Android uses). John Galt 1. Chrome on desktop doesn't support Payment Request Api. Only Chrome on Android does. 2. Unless it's intercepting it and actually doing the checkout and payment processing instead of using a merchant's processor, this is absolutely just Payment Request Api coming to Desktop. From what I can tell from the link it's not doing the former and is just the later and they've added some candy to use stuff stored in the browser as well as Android Pay Wallet.

Google will soon offer automatic APK size optimization to developers Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 10:53am PDTMay 18, 2017 19 Plus 1 on G+ 43 Share on Facebook 51 Share on Twitter Total Shares113 Development Google News Videos Apps are probably one of the biggest uses of space on your device, and they might be slimming down in the future. Google is preparing to offer developers an automatic APK optimization service. The idea is to deliver smaller APKs to users that have all the extraneous bits stripped out. Google has been doing something similar internally for years, which is why there are often so many different builds for each app. After opting in, third-party apps will get the same treatment. Devs upload the universal APK with the libraries and resources needed for all devices. Google can then trim things from the APK before delivering it to a user. For example, an app might include libraries for ARM and x86, but you don't need both of those on a phone. So, before sending an APK to an ARM phone, Google's Play Store magic could strip out all the x86 libraries. Google says it has seen a 20% drop in file sizes with some of its testing partners. That's great for your data usage, but it will mean more versions of APKs floating around that will only work on certain devices. It could get messy for sideloaders.

One of the things that I think are the silliest is that there are different apps for something perhaps on your phone, in vr, on your watch, etc. It'd be great if that was just a single app intelligently delivered in the smallest filesize. No need for different apps. JSo This would have been nice over the past year I had my 16GB Nexus 5X. I barely had anything on my internal storage but I was always low on space because of apps. My Nexus 5 never had this problem so I'm assuming apps just got bigger since then. antonio cesar actually, the difference between your nexus 5 and nexus 5x is that the nexus 5X has more space reserved for the system partition. the nexus 5 had about 1.8gb for the system partitions, i would assume the 5X has 3-4gb, to accomodate the more pre loaded gapps. JSo That could be the case. I just know I would scan my storage with a third party app and it would say all my space was being taken up by apps. antonio cesar its because those apps wont generally scan the sizes of the partition. sure your current data is filled with apps, but its because it has less space than your nexus 5. if you installed the same apps on your 5 and 5x and did the same scan, you would see that apps would consume less %of space than your 5x JSo Yeah, I get what you're saying. Regardless, smaller app sizes would have helped. antonio cesar Also I Also forgot to mention your /cache is larger aswell, on the Nexus 5 it was 500mb only, your 5x is larger due to larger OTA Sizes. I bet its about 1 - 1.5 GBs. Yes, anything helps with storage. i was just giving you the real reason why you had the lost of space between two identical storages Fardeen Beharry it is a good idea but it would suck so so much to sideload or transfer apk from one devices to another, iOS used to have a single fat IPA file for its app, since iOS 9 the did this app thinning thing like google is doing, it made backing up apps or sideloading so much more difficult Stu On iOS how has the change affected download and update times when using the app store? (If there's been a change at all) Fardeen Beharry made sideloading so annoying especially when u are trying to send IPA files to different models or architecture 😆😄 Another Play Store decision by Google that will alienate the 1% of its users. Jan-Lk Else Hard work will come to APKMirror Artem Russakovskii :-/ makapav The biggest risk I see is good luck getting stuff to work on Nvidia shield TV through side loading. ast00 I hope they start with their own apps.

The “Searching for Syria” site launched on Monday and will be featured on the Google home page “in selected countries,” according to a press release from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), The Verge says. Searching for Syria combines data from the UNHCR and Google to answer five questions: “what was Syria like before the war?”; “what is happening in Syria?”; “who is a refugee?”; “where are Syrian refugees going?”; and “how can I help Syrian refugees?” The site includes stories of people who have been displaced by the six-year war, alongside statistics that detail the scope of its devastation. It also features 360-degree videos of ancient sites that have been damaged or destroyed during the conflict, as well as Google Earth imagery taken before and after the war. A link to donate to the UNHCR is included at the very bottom of the page, as well as a link to the organization’s #WithRefugees petition, which calls for guaranteed education for refugee children and adequate homes for displaced families. “Searching for Syria aims to dispel myths and misconceptions about Syria and refugees and provide an entirely fresh look at the biggest humanitarian tragedy of today,” Filippo Grandi, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said in a statement Monday. “This is a fantastic project with Google that allows us to pinpoint and answer the five key questions about Syrian refugees and displaced that audiences most want to know and help us rally much needed support and funding for our humanitarian effort.” The site is currently available in English, French, German and Spanish, with an Arabic version to launch soon.

The world's most popular internet search engine has been in the Commission's crosshairs since 2010 over the promotion of its own shopping service in internet searches at the expense of the services of rivals. The EU competition enforcer opened a second front against Google last year as it charged the company with using its dominant Android mobile operating system to squeeze out rivals. It has since levelled a third charge, that of blocking rivals in online search advertising. This relates to Google's "AdSense for Search" platform, in which Google acts as an intermediary for websites such as online retailers, telecoms operators or newspapers. These searches produce results that include search ads. "In the next few months, we will reach a decision on the Google cases, Google search, AdSense and to me the most interesting is Android," Tommaso Valletti, the Commission's chief competition economist, told a conference organised by the University of Oxford Centre for Competition Law and Policy. The Commission has already warned Google that it would be fined if found guilty of breaching EU antitrust rules. Sanctions could reach 10 percent of annual global turnover for each case. Alphabet made consolidated revenues of around $90 billion in 2016. Google has in the past rejected the accusations, saying that its innovations had increased choice for European consumers and promoted competition. It made three unsuccessful attempts to settle the internet search case without any finding of wrongdoing and sanctions with European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager's predecessor, Joaquin Almunia.
