It was too late to stave off pernicious false rumors about Hillary Clinton’s health problems, or her involvement in a nonexistent underground child-prostitution ring, but the companies still moved to make it harder to spread similar misinformation in the future. Facebook and Google quickly took aim at the most egregious offenders: websites that peddled deceptive news stories in order to attract hordes of readers and make money off of advertising. Both companies banned those types of sites from their powerful ad networks. But there’s a category of often-misleading news sources that seems to have escaped the notice of tech companies: state-sponsored outlets like RT, a TV network and online news website that’s funded by the Russian government. As my colleagues Julia Ioffe and Rosie Gray wrote in the Columbia Journalism Review and BuzzFeed, respectively, RT—formerly known as Russia Today—routinely shapes its coverage portray Russia in the best possible light, and to make the West, and especially the United States, look bad. As part of a landmark report released last month, the intelligence community concluded that RT was part of a “state-run propaganda machine” that spread misinformation about the U.S. election. The report said RT “actively collaborated” with WikiLeaks, and gave its founder, Julian Assange, a platform from which to publicize documents stolen from top Democrats. (Some experts say, however, that the intelligence community may have overstated the channel’s influence.) RT stories regularly appear toward the top of Google search results. Earlier this month, when I Googled “ODNI hacking report” on my smartphone, I was inundated with links to RT news stories and video clips from its TV broadcasts. (ODNI stands for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which released the document.) A screenshot of Google search results for "ODNI hacking report." The first two items in the carousel of “featured news stories,” the top three listed search results, and seven of the ten featured videos on the page linked to RT content. One story presented the Kremlin’s line on the report: “It is truly reminiscent of a witch hunt.” In another story, Assange called the report “quite embarrassing to the reputations of the U.S. intelligence services.” The stories and videos aren’t factually inaccurate; they’re simply framed to discredit the hacking report and distance Russia from the accusations it contains. A Google spokesperson declined to comment on whether the company had any policies for how to rank and display news stories and videos from state-sponsored outlets like RT. But since I reached out to the company, searching for “ODNI hacking report” no longer displays sections for featured news stories or videos. On Tuesday, only one link on the first page of Google results for the search pointed to RT. Google came under fire in November when searches for “final election results” prominently featured a page from an amateur website that falsely claimed that President Donald Trump had won the popular vote. (In fact, Clinton received nearly 2.9 million more votes than Trump.) “In this case we clearly didn’t get it right,” a spokesperson for Google told me at the time. “But we are continually working to improve our algorithms.” Real estate on the all-important first page of Google results is a zero-sum game. Google searches for other political issues also turn up plenty of RT content, but none featured as many as the hacking report search earlier this month. The top news result in a search for “how big was women’s march” is an RT article focused on criticism of the mess left behind by demonstrators. A search for “Trump inauguration attendance” returned an RT story as a featured news article, with the headline, “‘You are wrong’: Trump & spokesperson blast media over inaugural attendance figures.” Data about Facebook engagement and reach isn’t public, beyond the number of people who like RT’s Facebook page: more than 4 million. That pales in comparison to Facebook pages of major American news networks, but eclipses the audience of smaller news sites and magazines. I asked a spokesperson for Facebook, which has taken an aggressive approach to slowing the spread of misleading news stories, if articles or videos from state-sponsored outlets are treated the same way as content from The New York Times or The Wall Street Journal. The spokesperson only pointed me to changes the company has already announced, which suppress the circulation of links to news stories that users report as false. But since RT’s stories are more likely to be biased than to be “purposefully fake or deceitful,” as Facebook’s reporting tool puts it, its users may not report them that way. Before Trump’s inauguration last week, RT was briefly banned from posting links, photos, and videos to Facebook. The network decried the ban as an act of censorship, but a Facebook spokesperson said that suggesting that the move was “in any way linked to outside factors or events is entirely inaccurate.” RT said the ban may have stemmed from a copyright claim. There’s a bright line between discussing how technology companies circulate news stories from state-funded outlets and advocating for media censorship. RT and other foreign state-sponsored sources can legally broadcast and publish in the United States without fear of reprisal or meddling. But today’s gatekeepers of online information, like Facebook, Google, and Twitter, get to decide what information deserves to be elevated—in Google’s “Top Stories” box, for example—and which, by extension, get suppressed. Real estate on the all-important first page of Google results is a zero-sum game: Only about ten links will ever appear on it for any one search, and if four of them point to one news site, those slots can’t be used to direct users elsewhere. Russia is far from the only country to sponsor a media organization. The U.K. helps fund the BBC, France 24 is paid for by the French government, and the U.S. funds publishers and broadcasters like Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. The problem isn’t RT’s funding sources, but rather its record of skewed, pro-Moscow reporting. Speaking to The Atlantic in 2015, Ann Cooper, a professor of journalism at Columbia University and an expert on Russian media, said that the government shouldn’t designate RT as a foreign agent. “You don’t want to get into a situation where you’re trying to set up categories and define different news agencies and basically say, ‘These ones are good, these ones are not,’” Cooper said. She argued that the public should be allowed to choose what news source they want to listen to. And RT, of course, isn’t about to swallow up a significant portion of the U.S. news landscape. According to The Economist, the network routinely inflates the size of its TV audience, and its performance on Facebook and Twitter falls way behind mainstream news networks like CNN and the BBC, newspapers like The New York Times, and news services like Reuters and the Associated Press.

Twitter Facebook Email Most Popular Presented by Pablo Martinez Monsivais / AP How Trump’s Executive Orders Could Set America Back 70 Years Jeremi Suri The president is taking the United States back to the nightmares of the world before the Second World War: closed borders, limited trade, and a go-it-alone national race to the bottom. Despite all the lies and distortions, President Donald Trump has spent his first week in office assembling a coherent and well-planned framework for foreign policy. It is hiding in plain sight—frequently missed in the storm of tweets and the attacks on domestic enemies. Read as a whole and in detail, with attention to their larger single-minded purpose, Trump’s executive orders are the blueprints for the most significant shift in American foreign policy since the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. The latest drafts of executive orders, several of which the president will reportedly sign Friday at the Pentagon, are bold and breathtaking in their reach. They are strategic and transformative. They are also poised to destroy the foundations for the last 70 years of American-led peace and prosperity. The orders question the very ideas of cooperation and democracy, embodying an aggressive commitment to “America First” above all else. So much for the “defense of the free world,” and the “march of freedom”—obvious soft-headed “loser” ideas for the new team of White House cynics. Continue Reading Lucy Nicholson / Reuters On Pitying Melania Megan Garber Via memes, jokes, and fan fictions, many Americans have taken it upon themselves to feel bad for their new first lady. She is not in need of the sympathy. Did you see the gif? The one that features Melania Trump, the newly installed first lady of the United States, radiantly smiling as her husband gazes upon her … and then, as he turns away, allowing the grin to melt into a frown? Grin-grimace, grin-grimace, grin-grimace, looping into eternity. Call it a Kinsley gif: The image seemed to reveal, in its frozen fluidity, an unspoken truth—about Melania, about her marriage, about all of us. During a time of Much News, it quickly became conversation fodder. Slate offered “A Detailed Forensic Analysis of Melania Trump’s Creepy, Devastating Inauguration Smile/Frown.” Jezebel shared it with the sardonic declaration that “Melania Trump Definitely Loves Her Husband and Is Very Happy to Be Here.” New York magazine did a fact-check of the video the gif came from to assure us, finally, that “That Awkward Clip of Donald and Melania at the Inauguration Is Definitely Real.” (Snopes agreed, but warned that the video is inconclusive when it comes to its ability to reveal Melania’s emotions.) #FreeMelania trended. Continue Reading Lenny Ignelzi / AP Which Christians Are Telling Donald Trump to Keep Out Refugees? Emma Green Many religious groups have urged the president not to give Christians priority in seeking asylum, but some conservative political organizations back his new policy. President Trump has signed an executive order that temporarily suspends the U.S. refugee program and bars Syrian refugees. It will likely suspend immigration from certain Muslim-majority countries and bars the admission of anyone who engages in “acts of bigotry or hatred,” including “the persecution of those who practice religions different from their own.” It also allows the the secretaries of State and Homeland Security to jointly admit individuals on a case-by-case basis, “including when the person is a religious minority ... facing religious persecution.” In an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network on Friday, Trump clarified what this means: Christians refugees will be given priority status. “They’ve been horribly treated,” the president said. “Do you know if you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible, at least very tough, to get into the United States? If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible.” People overseas “were chopping off the heads of everybody, but more so the Christians,” he added, “so we are going to help them.” Continue Reading Tom Pennington / Getty Images The Mind of Donald Trump Dan P. McAdams Narcissism, disagreeableness, grandiosity—a psychologist investigates how Trump’s extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006, Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate, near Aberdeen, Scotland, aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estate’s owner, Tom Griffin, sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock & Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator, reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But, as Michael D’Antonio writes in his recent biography of Trump, Never Enough, Griffin’s most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. “It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump,” Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Bettman / Getty A Twitter Tribute to Holocaust Victims Candice Norwood A new social-media project commemorates refugees turned away by the United States in 1939. Software developer Russel Neiss and Rabbi Charlie Schwartz have collaborated on a number of projects that use technology to bring awareness to Jewish issues, history, and culture. But last night they dreamt up the St. Louis Manifest, a Twitter project sharing the story of some 900 Jews who fled Nazi Germany in 1939 on the MS St. Louis in an attempt to gain entry into the United States. After being turned way, the passengers were forced to return to Europe, where a number of countries accepted them as refugees; 254 of them were killed in the Holocaust. This story, Neiss and Schwartz believe, serves as a fitting tribute to International Holocaust Remembrance Day on Friday, and a reminder of a time in American history when the country closed its doors to refugees. Continue Reading Mark Kauzlarich / Reuters What Does the Billionaire Family Backing Donald Trump Really Want? Rosie Gray The Mercers are enjoying more influence than ever with their candidate in the White House—but no one seems to know how they intend to use it. She owns a cookie store. He loves model trains. They both hate the Clintons. And beyond that, not much is clear about the motivations of the Mercer father-daughter duo of Republican megadonors who have become two of the most powerful people in the country over the last 18 months. Hedge-fund billionaire Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebekah were among the earliest and strongest backers of Donald Trump while other elite donors still disdained him. It turned out to be a good investment. But now, with their favored candidate freshly installed as president of the United States, it remains unclear what they believe, or what they hope their investment will yield. The Mercers have been a quiet but constant presence in the background of Republican politics since the beginning of the 2016 cycle. They started the campaign as backers of Ted Cruz, pouring millions into one of the main super PACs supporting his candidacy. Their data firm, Cambridge Analytica, was hired by the Cruz campaign. They switched to support Trump shortly after he clinched the nomination, and he eventually hired Cambridge Analytica, as well. Their top political guru is Steve Bannon, the former Breitbart News chairman and White House chief strategist. They’re close, too, with Trump’s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, who also has a senior role in the White House. They never speak to the press and hardly ever even release a public statement. Like Trump himself, they’ve flouted the standard playbook for how things are done in politics. Continue Reading Stoyan Nenov / Reuters The Coldhearted Folly of Trump's Proposed Immigration Order Graeme Wood The countries likely affected are not those whose nationals have actually perpetrated the most ghastly attacks on Western targets. When I first started talking to ISIS propagandists and supporters, I was much impressed by one of their favorite Koranic verses: “We have already created man and know what his soul whispers to him, and We are closer to him than [his] jugular vein.” The verse is a reminder of God’s omnipresence, and his Santa Claus-like awareness of our deepest selves, our sins, and our good deeds. In time, I came to associate that unsettling proximity (He is closer than you think) not only with God, but also with ISIS. They too were less distant than they seemed. What seemed at first like a movement of barbarians with alien origins and impulses looked increasingly like a human phenomenon, with human flaws and virtues (mostly flaws). The more I investigated the group’s supporters, the more I found people who at one point had shared my culture and community, even if they tried to throw it all away in the service of something wicked. In the end I discovered that one of the most important figures in the Islamic State, a mysterious ideologue named Yahya Abu Hassan, was not Syrian or Iraqi at all, but a 33-year-old American, a dope-smoking theological prodigy from my own hometown.

It’s a little before 3 p.m. on a sunny Friday afternoon and Laugardalur Park, near central Reykjavik, looks practically deserted. There’s an occasional adult with a stroller, but the park’s surrounded by apartment blocks and houses, and school’s out—so where are all the kids? Walking with me are Gudberg Jónsson, a local psychologist, and Harvey Milkman, an American psychology professor who teaches for part of the year at Reykjavik University. Twenty years ago, says Gudberg, Icelandic teens were among the heaviest-drinking youths in Europe. “You couldn’t walk the streets in downtown Reykjavik on a Friday night because it felt unsafe,” adds Milkman. “There were hordes of teenagers getting in-your-face drunk.” Continue Reading Jon Woo / Reuters Can the U.S. Military Compete With China’s Rooster-Dancing Capabilities? Uri Friedman Behold the awesome power of the People’s Liberation Army. The Chinese government clearly received the message when Donald Trump pledged to not only rebuild the U.S. military, but also show it off with parades down Pennsylvania Avenue and flyovers of New York City. In response, Beijing has sent America’s new president a signal that it too can play that game. That signal comes in the form of a rooster, which, in Chinese astrology, is associated with people who are hardworking, supremely confident, and demanding of attention. In marking the dawn of each new day, one Chinese scholar observes, roosters are in charge of “time.” The Chinese government’s point—at a time of serious tensions between the world powers over trade, Taiwan, and the South China Sea—is unambiguous: Trump may want to Make America Great Again, but the coming century belongs to China, not America.

It was late October, Friday the 21st, and the president had spent many of the previous weeks, as he would spend the two subsequent weeks, campaigning for the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton. Things were looking up. Polls in the crucial states of Virginia and Pennsylvania showed Clinton with solid advantages. The formidable GOP strongholds of Georgia and Texas were said to be under threat. The moment seemed to buoy Obama. He had been light on his feet in these last few weeks, cracking jokes at the expense of Republican opponents and laughing off hecklers. At a rally in Orlando on October 28, he greeted a student who would be introducing him by dancing toward her and then noting that the song playing over the loudspeakers—the Gap Band’s “Outstanding”—was older than she was.

Sci-Tech by Eric Mack January 26, 2017 11:56 AM PST @ericcmack Up Next Meet Jon Hamm, the hologram (aka the holohamm) Enlarge Image A new algorithm can visually discern malignant skin lesions from less dangerous ones. Stanford/Matt Young Artificial intelligence that diagnoses skin cancer as well as a dermatologist could one day rest in the palm of your hand. A team from the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory set up a machine-learning AI to teach itself to diagnose cancer by looking at skin lesions just as a doctor would during an exam. The team tested the algorithm against 21 board-certified dermatologists, and it performed just as well as its human counterparts. "We realized it was feasible, not just to do something well, but as well as a human dermatologist," Sebastian Thrun, an adjunct professor in the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, said in a statement. "That's when our thinking changed. That's when we said, 'Look, this is not just a class project for students, this is an opportunity to do something great for humanity.'" Thrun is perhaps better known as one of the founders of both Udacity and Google X. A paper on the system co-authored by him and his colleagues appeared in the journal Nature Wednesday. 17 How Hollywood sees AI, in 16 films The researchers envision making the algorithm compatible with smartphones, putting skin cancer diagnosis into the hands of just about anyone anywhere. "Early detection is critical, as the estimated five-year survival rate for melanoma drops from over 99 percent if detected in its earliest stages to about 14 percent if detected in its latest stages," the paper reads. "We developed a computational method which may allow medical practitioners and patients to proactively track skin lesions and detect cancer earlier." The AI is a convolutional neural network, the same type of system Google uses to wallop masters of the ancient game Go. The researchers used one of Google's AI systems -- the GoogleNet Inception v3 CNN architecture, which had already been taught to visually identify different objects. But it hadn't yet been trained to tell the difference between a malignant carcinoma and a harmless skin lesion, so the team pulled together a dataset to transform the neural network into a digital dermatologist. 'Farsighted' looks on the technological bright side of 2016 (Farsighted, Ep 3) Not everyone loved 2016, but we could look back on it as the year we made real progress toward living longer, better and perhaps even on Mars. by Eric Mack 51:04 Close Drag More from the future Dr. Google may check your eyes in the future Artificial intelligence has a big year ahead 2016 wasn't so bad: 5 ways this year will shape the future "There's no huge dataset of skin cancer that we can just train our algorithms on, so we had to make our own," said Brett Kuprel, co-lead author of the paper and a graduate student in the Thrun lab. "We gathered images from the internet and worked with the medical school to create a nice taxonomy out of data that was very messy -- the labels alone were in several languages, including German, Arabic and Latin." The coders collaborated with dermatologists and others in the medical field on the project. "Advances in computer-aided classification of benign versus malignant skin lesions could greatly assist dermatologists in improved diagnosis for challenging lesions and provide better management options for patients," said Susan Swetter, professor of dermatology and co-author of the paper. "However, rigorous prospective validation of the algorithm is necessary before it can be implemented in clinical practice, by practitioners and patients alike." Last year, Google announced that it trained an algorithm to spot diabetic retinopathy, which can cause blindness. Fortunately, while we wait for these sort of "doctor's helpers" forms of A.I. to hit hospitals and clinics, we can bide our time by letting the same sorts of systems kick our butts at Go and all sort of other games.

The suit further alleged that Anderson downloaded “hundreds of gigabytes of Tesla confidential and four proprietary information” documents to his personal computer. When he was terminated, Anderson returned the documents, but not the backups he created, the company alleged. In addition to making offers to a dozen Tesla employees — only two of whom accepted, according to the suit — Tesla is also alleging Anderson worked on the company Urmson was starting, called Aurora, during company time. Recode first reported that Urmson was starting his own self-driving company and that he was recruiting big names from many players, including Tesla and Uber. The suit claims that Urmson recruited Tesla engineers on behalf of Anderson, and Anderson recruited engineers from Google on behalf of Urmson to avoid being accused of breach of contract. According to the suit: Although Anderson worked mostly behind the scenes so that he could try to create the false impression that his "hands stayed clean" — ignoring that his contract with Tesla prohibited both direct and indirect solicitation of Tesla employees — he took a more hands-on role with respect to certain recruits, directly lobbying them to join Aurora. Anderson’s conversations with Urmson began in the summer of 2016, according to the suit, but it wasn’t until December 2016 that he notified Tesla he was leaving. The company claims that he did not indicate he was leaving to join a competing venture with Urmson and instead said that he was going to spend time with family or start a non-competing company. “Obviously, had Anderson disclosed the true facts to Tesla, he would have been terminated immediately,” the suit read. “Instead, it was agreed that Anderson would remain with the company through the release of the next Autopilot upgrade, expected within the following several weeks.” Anderson joined Tesla in 2014 as a senior product manager and was promoted to director of Autopilot in 2015. Tesla also claims Anderson attempted to cover his tracks and wiped his work computer and iPhone before returning them to the company “in a manner intended to prevent them from being restored and manipulated the timestamps,” the suit reads. The company is seeking damages, to be determined during a jury trial, from both Anderson and Urmson for breach of contract, breach of duty of loyalty and aiding and abetting breach of duty of loyalty among other things. Update: Urmson sent Recode this statement: “Tesla’s meritless lawsuit reveals both a startling paranoia and an unhealthy fear of competition. This abuse of the legal system is a malicious attempt to stifle a competitor and destroy personal reputations. Aurora looks forward to disproving these false allegations in court and to building a successful self-driving business.” Tesla said it had no comment beyond what was included in the suit.

Although Google hasn't released sales figures, industry researchers say the Pixel has been a hot item since its October debut was greeted with mostly glowing reviews and the biggest marketing blitz in Google's 18-year history. But there were missed opportunities. FILE - In this Tuesday, Oct. 4, 2016, file photo, the new Google Pixel phone is displayed following a product event, in San Francisco. Google¿s head-on rival to the iPhone, the Pixel, is off to a modest but promising start. It is Google's first step in what it says will be a years-long effort to take on Apple where it¿s strongest. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File) Google didn't have enough Pixels available to meet demand. Rather than wait several weeks, many consumers interested in the Pixel probably bought an iPhone, Galaxy or another phone instead. And these people aren't likely to need a phone replacement for another year or two. Google also struck a deal to sell it through just one wireless carrier, Verizon. Although Google's online store sold Pixels compatible with other wireless networks, most people don't shop for phones that way. Of course, it's a moot point if there weren't enough Pixels to sell, but Google likely would have produced more if it had distribution deals with other carriers. It's not surprising that Google misjudged the market, given that this is the search company's first stab at making its own phone. Previously, it partnered with various manufacturers on a Nexus line of phones to showcase its Android operating system, but that effort barely made a dent. "This was probably a really good learning experience for them," says Neil Doshi, an analyst with Mizhuo Securities USA. The Pixel's success is important to Google because it wants to ensure there's a stylish Android phone to compete with the iPhone and drive more affluent consumers to its search engine, maps, YouTube videos and other services. Samsung's Galaxy and other phones also run on Android, but those devices have been de-emphasizing Google's services. Google, which is based in Mountain View, California, can afford to make some mistakes as it tries to establish the Pixel because its internet search and advertising network brings in so much revenue. Alphabet, Google's corporate parent, provided another reminder of its financial might with Thursday's release of its fourth-quarter earnings. The company earned $5.3 billion on revenue of $26 billion during the final three months of last year. Even after subtracting commissions paid to Google's ad partners, Alphabet's revenue totaled $21 billion — a 23 percent increase from a year earlier. The company's profit rose 8 percent from the prior year. Although Pixel sales weren't disclosed, the numbers provided a clue on how the phone did. Google's "other revenue" segment, which covers all sales outside of advertising, generated $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter, a 62 percent increase from the same time last year. Some of those gains came from sales of Google's new internet-connected speaker, Home, and its business software services, but Doshi believes most of the increase was generated by the Pixel. He estimates Google sold 1 million to 1.5 million Pixels during the fourth quarter. That's still just a sliver of the estimated 77 million that Apple sold during the same period (Apple is scheduled to release its numbers Tuesday). Pixel sales are also well below the roughly 15 million Galaxy S7 that Samsung sold during that device's first quarter on the market. Still, analysts say the Pixel did exceptionally well for a new phone with little brand recognition. "Without question, Google has a hit on its hands and is building a platform for success," says Jeff Moore, principal of Wave7 Research. Wave7 estimates that Pixel accounted for 12 percent of activations in December compared with 51 percent for iPhones and 26 percent for Samsung devices. Localytics, which tracks app activity on nearly 2 billion smartphones, also reported Pixel activations have steadily increased since sales began, especially around the Thanksgiving weekend and the holidays. "It looks like it has the potential to be a strong competitor to the likes of Apple and Samsung," says Josh Todd, Localytics' chief marketing officer.

Sign up now Menu ARN Gmail will block JavaScript attachments, a common source of malware Gmail will block JavaScript attachments, a common source of malware In February, the .JS file extension will be added to a list of 31 file types that Gmail already blocks Lucian Constantin (IDG News Service) 27 January, 2017 06:59 - - - - print email Comments Starting Feb. 13, Google will no longer allow JavaScript attachments on its Gmail service, killing one of the main methods of malware distribution over the past two years. Users will no longer be able to attach .JS files to emails in Gmail, regardless of whether they attach them directly or they include them in archives like .gz, .bz2, .zip or .tgz. For those rare cases when such files need to be shared via email, users can upload them to a storage service like Google Drive and then share the link. The .JS file extension will be added an existing list of other banned file attachments that includes: .ADE, .ADP, .BAT, .CHM, .CMD, .COM, .CPL, .EXE, .HTA, .INS, .ISP, .JAR, .JSE, .LIB, .LNK, .MDE, .MSC, .MSP, .MST, .PIF, .SCR, .SCT, .SHB, .SYS, .VB, .VBE, .VBS, .VXD, .WSC, .WSF and .WSH. Most of these file types have long been abused by cybercriminals to send malware via email. The same thing has happened with .JS over the past two years, especially since JavaScript files can be executed directly on Windows thanks to a system component called the Windows Script Host (WSH). The JavaScript files, which are typically obfuscated, can serve as downloaders for other malware and have been especially preferred by ransomware pushers. Widespread threats like TeslaCrypt and Locky have used this method of distribution and one particular ransomware program dubbed RAA was written completely in JavaScript. "Be wary of emails with JavaScript attachments," researchers with Microsoft's Malware Protection Center warned in a blog post in April. "It is uncommon and quite suspicious for people to send legitimate applications in pure JavaScript file format (files with .js or .jse extension) via email. Do not click or open it." Other scripting files like .VBS (VBScript), .VBE (VBScript Encoded), .WSH (Windows Script Host Settings File) and .WSF (Windows Script File) -- all of which Gmail already blocks -- can be used in a similar way. The general rule is that if you don't recognize a file type and don't know what it does, you should never open it. If you are expecting files in unusual formats, you should always double check the source before opening them and it would be best not to share them via email.

Google’s Sundar Pichai says it’s ‘very early days’ in the battle against Amazon Echo Posted yesterday by Brian Heater (@bheater) 0 SHARES Next Story The League brings its picky dating app to Android Between the Pixel and Google Home, 2016 was a big year for Google voice search, but the company’s plays in the space still seemed to pale in comparison to Amazon’s infiltration, courtesy of its wildly successful Echo devices. In today’s Q4 Alphabet earnings call, Google Inc. CEO Sundar Pichai addressed what looks to be a late start from the company, calling the voice search space, “very early days,” adding, “We expect voice to work from many different contexts. We are thinking about it across phones, homes, TVs, cars and trying to drive the ecosystem that way, and we want it to be there for users when they need it.” Without giving specific numbers, the exec cited Home’s brisk sales, calling Q4 “very strong” for the product. Pichai added that the company plans to invest “a lot” in the category, coupled with a long-term commitment to voice that predates the connected home device by some time. “When I look at what it would take to do voice search well, our years of research into natural language voice processing comes into play,” he said. “I think there’s a lot of work ahead to make this work well for users. This is a core area we’ve invested in for the long term, so this is an area I feel comfortable about how it will play out in the future.” Pichai’s not wrong, of course. The real war for the connected home has really only started playing out, but it’s hard to ignore Amazon’s healthy head start, both in terms of home infiltration and third-party partners. Google has certainly been aggressive on both fronts, with a number of announcements around Home and Assistant in recent months. That, coupled with widespread Android device deployment and years of search and voice investment, could ultimately end up paying off for the company in the long run.

She previously was a reporter for the Wall Street Journal. Follow @ShiraOvide Facebook Twitter Email Print Share Jan 26, 2017 5:41 PM EST ALPHABET INC-CL A -11.95 At Closing, Jan 27th 845.03 USD AMAZON.COM INC -3.38 At Closing, Jan 27th 835.77 USD Eventually, investors' worst fears about Google may come true. Just not yet.  For all the buzz about Google's self-driving cars and other science projects, Google parent company Alphabet Inc. generates about 90 percent of its revenue from the old-fashioned business (with a Google twist) of advertising. And much of those ad dollars emanate directly or indirectly from Google’s absolute lock on its original business in web search. Essentially the world's second-most valuable company is a one-trick pony -- although it is perhaps the best pony ever created. And if the pony ever goes lame, so does Google. The horror story about Google’s end days plays out something like this: As more people surf smartphones and not computers, they won't need to search on Google for a new winter coat, a hotel room in Hawaii or the winner of the 1984 Super Bowl. They'll simply go directly to Amazon, Expedia or ask Siri for the answer. If the zeal to Google things slowly ebbs, that will allow Facebook and others to chip away at Google's commanding share of the $200 billion global market for online advertisements. In Front Google continues to grab by far the largest share of digital advertising in the world, although its market share has ebbed a bit Source: eMarketer, Sept. 2016 estimates Note: Figures are for net revenue from ads shown on computers, mobile phones and other internet-connected devices. Despite an earnings miss on Thursday, it's tough to find evidence that the pony is anywhere close to be putting out to pasture. Alphabet said on Thursday that its revenue excluding payments to advertising partners rose 23 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016 from a year earlier. That was the company's 12th consecutive quarter of at least 13 percent net revenue growth on a year-over-year basis, according to Bloomberg data. It is extremely unusual for companies with $90 billion in yearly revenue to grow so quickly. Amazon.com Inc. and Chinese e-commerce website JD.com Inc. are among the handful of giant companies with a faster rate of sales gains than Alphabet. Neither of them has operating profit margins anywhere close to Alphabet’s 25.5 percent in the fourth quarter. In short, Alphabet is huge, incredibly profitable, added $15 billion in new revenue in 2016 and has by far the best technology in the giant market for internet advertisements. Google Envy Google's parent company posted its 12th consecutive quarter of revenue growth above 13% Source: Bloomberg Note: Revenue figures exclude payments to distribution partners. Google continues to grow because it keeps coming up with new ways to squeeze more advertising dollars from its command of the intricacies of the internet and troves of data on how people spend their digital lives. It has been dialing up the number of ads it sells next to many Google searches on smartphones. Trying to steal a page from Amazon, Google is also becoming more sophisticated in paid product placements in digital catalogs. The number of clicks on ads sold by Google rose 36 percent in the fourth quarter, the best gain in years. Even subtle improvements in Google’s ability to get people to click on digital advertisements really add up for a company that touches nearly everything people do online or on their phones. Even the worst fear -- that people would stop searching on smartphones -- hasn’t panned out yet. Google has said that more than half of its web searches are on mobile devices. It’s hard to know exactly how individual parts of Google are doing, but RBC Capital Markets estimates ad sales for the company’s core web search operation are growing by a low-to-mid teens percentage each year. On a call with analysts on Thursday, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the web search business has "lots of headroom ahead."  Consecutive Quarters of 13%+ Net Revenue Growth at Alphabet 12 And while YouTube isn’t quite living up to its financial potential, that valuable asset plus early efforts to turn Google Maps into a billboard for advertisements will be surefire future sources of revenue growth. That means even if Larry Page’s various experiments in driverless cars, curing the world’s diseases and internet-beaming drones never pan out, Alphabet should still do just fine. The worst fears about Google may come true someday. People may eventually stop searching. The burning piles of cash from Page's nonadvertising projects could drag the company down. Regulators in Europe and beyond are keeping close watch on Google’s growing power and could move to curb it. For now, however, the constant stream of new types of ads in more places -- combined with Google's reams of consumer information -- is keeping the Alphabet advertising engine churning. The one-trick pony should keep galloping for years to come. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners. It’s amazing how little is known about the financial performance of individual parts of Alphabet. Even for YouTube, one of Google's biggest businesses, its number of users and annual revenue are unclear.  To contact the author of this story: Shira Ovide in New York at sovide@bloomberg.net To contact the editor responsible for this story: Daniel Niemi at dniemi1@bloomberg.net Over It Over It Honeywell cut its overall revenue guidance for 2017 and investors were unfazed as they focused on other things Source: Bloomberg Bottom Line Honeywell Delivers Where It Counts Industrials Brooke Sutherland Weak Spot Google Has a Chink in Its Ad Armor Tech Shira Ovide Share Of Memory Chip Business Toshiba Might Sell 20% Yum Toshiba Chips Make for Tasty Chinese Takeout Tech Tim Culpan Mo' Money Mo' Money The swell of assets chasing hedge fund strategies has been too much for the industry to bear Source: Bloomberg Smart Money Harvard Goes Back to Hedge Fund Basics Markets Nir Kaissar Publicis shares, intraday +1.01% Au Revoir Levy Ends an Era Management Leila Abboud Hello ECB We Have a Problem With You Here Hello ECB We Have a Problem With You Here Inflation is anathema to Germans and with elections this September the heat is on Source: Bloomberg Big Jump German Inflation's Back.

Don't Miss: Netflix for Android just got a new feature iPhone owners will never see Google already blocks certain file types that can execute programs on a computer, including .exe, .bat, and .msc files. But starting February 13th, Gmail users won’t be able to open .js files from Gmail. In fact, Google will not even let you receive JavaScript attachments anymore. A warning telling you that some files are blocked will pop up, and you won’t be able to attach a .js file to an outgoing email in Gmail no matter what you do. You can’t even archive it. Google will detect .js files in archives including .zip, .tgz, .gz, and .bz2 files, so there’s no point trying. Naturally, if you have genuine reasons to share .js files, you still can do it, but you’ll have to go through Google Drive instead of attaching them to Gmail emails. The worry with JavaScript attachments is that they can open the door to severe malware attacks, including ransomware. The malicious .js files might not do any harm by themselves, but they can act as downloaders for other programs that could lock you out of your computer or install other malware. It’s great to see Google strengthening Gmail security, especially in light of the fact that hackers continuously come up with more sophisticated attacks. Just recently, Gmail users discovered a pretty scary phishing attack that’s able to fool even some of the most savvy Android users into handing hackers their Google account credentials.

 Google's Q4 profit comes up short and the stock takes a hit Steve Kovach Jan. 26, 2017, 3:45 PM 8,195 facebook linkedin twitter email print Alphabet CEO Larry Page.AP Alphabet's stock sank in after hours trading on Thursday after the Google-parent company missed Wall Street's earnings target. Google’s mobile search and video ads boosted revenue in the fourth quarter, but increased spending in hardware and other new businesses, as well as a larger-than-expected tax rate, weighted on the bottom line. Alphabet stock was down about 2% at $814.80 in after-hours trading on Thursday. Here are the key numbers from Q4: Revenue: $26.06 billion, up 22% year-on-year and above the $25.2 billion expected by analysts EPS (adjusted): $9.36 versus $9.67 expected by analysts Cost of revenues: $10.66 billion (up from $8.188 billion in the year-ago quarter) Paid clicks on Google properties: Up 43% year over year Paid click on Google Network Members' properties: Up 7% year over year Cost-per-click on Google properties: -16% year over year Cost-per-click on Google Network Members' properties: -19% year over year Other Bets revenues: $262 million (was $150 million in the year-ago quarter) Other Bets operating loss: $1.088 billion (was $1.21 billion in the year-ago quarter) "Other revenues" were up 62% year over year. That figure represents hardware, which Google has increasingly focused on with the launch of new products like the Google Pixel phone, Daydream View virtual reality headset, and Google Home voice-controlled speaker. In addition to the hard numbers, investors had their eyes on Alphabet's Other Bets companies — the collection of "moonshot" businesses focused on everything ffrom self-driving cars to biotech. Alphabet ended several projects and lost many top executives and leaders during the back half of 2016. The moves were designed to help cut costs from Other Bets, which have yet to generate any meaningful revenue for Alphabet. Alphabet's CFO, Ruth Porat, only briefly touched on Other Bets in her opening remarks during the company's earnings call, saying she will continue to look at investments in those projects. One Other Bet that did get some positive attention this week: Verily. On Thursday morning, Alphabet announced that Verily, which develops health technology like smart contact lenses, received a $800 million investment from a private firm based in Singapore. During the call, Google CEO Sundar Pichai touched a lot on Google's main new areas of investment like hardware, cloud services, and YouTube. However, Pichai wouldn't give any hard numbers for subscribers to paid YouTube services like YouTube Red or YouTube Music, saying only it was "early days" for those products. As for voice search, which is built into the Home speaker and other Google products and services, Pichai slightly downplayed its importance, saying voice is just one way users will interact with Google. One concern with the growth in voice search is that Google won't be able to sell ads against it like it can with search on mobile or desktop. Pichai said he sees this problem as "more of an opportunity than a challenge."

Credit: Raspberry Pi More like this Apple collaborates with rivals to advance A.I. research Why Google A.I. is the last user interface Intel chases A.I. with new chips, but still lacks a potent GPU Video Smart Cities: Barcelona Google wants to bring smarts to cool gadgets and devices made using Raspberry Pi 3 or Intel's Edison. The company is chasing makers with open-source tools needed to add artificial intelligence to consumer, industrial, and retail devices made using board computers. The plan may include machine-learning tools, which are central to A.I. Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, and Microsoft's Cortana answer questions with the help of A.I., and the technology also helps self-driving cars cruise the streets safely. "We don't have any specifics to announce right now, but we're excited to keep sharing open-source machine learning tools with the community -- stay tuned for more this year," a Google spokesman said in an email. Earlier this week, Google published a market research survey in an effort to get a better grip on the maker community and its priorities. In the survey, Google hinted it was bringing "smart tools" to makers. In a blog entry, Raspberry Pi said those machine-learning tools will come later this year and will make smart devices even more powerful. [ To comment on this story, visit Computerworld's Facebook page. ] Devices could incorporate Google A.I. technologies like image and speech recognition. For example, a home-brewed robot or drone may be able to better recognize objects with Google's tools, or be able to respond to queries. Google provides APIs (application programming interfaces) so the services can be tweaked in gadgets. Google's voice recognition is the company's most visible A.I. technology. The Google Assistant is used in smartphones, tablets, TVs, and appliances like Google Home. But the technology hasn't been fully explored in smart devices made using board computers like Raspberry Pi 3. Providing a helping hand to makers could provide Google one more avenue to grow in the emerging internet-of-things market. According to analyst firm IHS, shipments of IoT devices will reach 30.7 billion by 2020 and 75.4 billion by 2025, outstripping smartphones and PCs. The spread of Google's A.I. tools to IoT devices could also help Google take on Amazon, whose Alexa voice assistant dominated CES this year. Alexa is being incorporated into cars, home appliances, and numerous gadgets. Companies like Microsoft, Samsung, and Intel have also been chasing makers. Microsoft's Windows 10 IoT Core is compatible with Raspberry Pi 3, and makers get access to analytics and machine-learning tools in the Azure cloud. Samsung is providing its Artik Board users access to the Artik Cloud, through which makers can access to data analysis services and A.I. technologies. Artik Cloud also works with Raspberry Pi boards, Amazon Echo, Nest devices, and wearables like Fitbit trackers. It's possible Google could make the machine-learning framework called TensorFlow available to makers. The software could help devices learn based on patterns, input, and trends. But boards don't have much processing power, so the tools could push back decision-making to Google's cloud, which has more powerful A.I. and data-analysis tools. For example, a robot may have limited image recognition technology and may instead consult the cloud when trying to identify an obstacle. Some companies like Movidius -- which is part of Intel -- have modified TensorFlow code to improve computer vision in robots and drones. Google is also finalizing its IoT technology called Android Things, a lightweight version of the Android OS. The company hasn't talked about A.I. technologies available in Android Things.

While advertising still accounts for the lion's share of Google's revenue, rising 17.4 percent to $22.4 billion in the quarter, Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat underscored that the company is broadening its business - pointing to growth in hardware, app sales and the cloud business. The company's other revenue, which captures such businesses, climbed 62 percent to $3.4 billion. "We see tremendous potential ahead for these businesses, as well as in the continued development of non-advertising revenue streams for YouTube," Porat said on a call with investors. The results were met with a mixed reaction from Wall Street, which sent shares down 2.2 percent to $838 in extended trade after closing at $856.98 on Nasdaq. Google faced a higher tax rate of 22 percent, compared to 19 percent for the year overall, contributing to the dent in profitability. "If you look above that, it's business as usual," said analyst James Wang of ARK Investment Management. "There has been no margin compression in the actual business." Executives suggested that they are beginning to reap the rewards of their investment in hardware. Porat spotlighted the company's line of Nest smart home products, saying sales doubled during the key holiday period including Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Google-branded hardware also showed promise as Google Home, a smart speaker, and the Pixel smartphone gained traction over the holidays, Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said during the call. "We're committed to this for the long term as a great way to bring a beautiful, seamless Google experience to people," he said. The company posted a stronger-than-expected 22.2 percent increase in quarterly revenue as advertisers spent more to reach an expanding user base that spends more time on smartphones and YouTube. Research firm eMarketer has estimated that Google will capture $60.92 billion in search ad revenue this year, or 58.8 percent of the search ad market worldwide. Paid clicks, or clicks on Google ads, rose 36 percent, compared with a 33 percent increase in the third quarter. Paid clicks are those ads on which an advertiser pays only if a user clicks on them. Analysts on average had expected a rise of 26.9 percent, according to FactSet StreetAccount. Cost-per-click dropped 9 percent, a slide that has continued as Google sells more mobile ads, which command lower prices. However, the shift is not necessarily alarming as it suggests Google is selling more ads on YouTube, which are seen as a key growth driver, Rice said. Alphabet's Other Bets revenue increased to $262 million from $150 million a year earlier, while the operating loss of $1.09 billion narrowed from $1.21 billion. Other Bets includes broadband business Google Fiber, home automation products Nest, self-driving technology company Waymo as well as X, the company's research facility that works on "moon shot" ventures. Verily Life Sciences, one such bet, announced Thursday that Singapore-based investment company Temasek had invested $800 million for a minority stake in the company. The investment reflects Alphabet's greater fiscal discipline under Porat and suggests a potential new model for the other bets, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. "Getting external investors involved helps spread that risk out and reduces Google's exposure," he said. "It also allows some things to move faster than they would if it were just Google's cash backing them." Alphabet's net income rose to $5.33 billion, or $7.56 per Class A and B share and Class C capital stock, in the fourth quarter, from $4.92 billion, or $7.06 per share, a year earlier. See graphic on earnings: (http://bit.ly/2kyl4fS) Excluding items, the company earned $9.36 per share, below the average estimate of $9.64 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company's consolidated revenue rose to $26.06 billion above the average estimate of $25.26 billion.

Google’s head-on rival to the iPhone, the Pixel, is off to a modest but promising start. It is Google's first step in what it says will be a years-long effort to take on Apple where it’s strongest. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File)(Credit: AP) SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The Pixel phone, Google’s answer to Apple’s iPhone and Samsung’s Galaxy, is off to a promising start — but might have done even better had Google managed consumer demand as smartly as the device’s sleek design. Although Google hasn’t released sales figures, industry researchers say the Pixel has been a hot item since its October debut was greeted with mostly glowing reviews and the biggest marketing blitz in Google’s 18-year history. But there were missed opportunities. Google didn’t have enough Pixels available to meet demand. Rather than wait several weeks, many consumers interested in the Pixel probably bought an iPhone, Galaxy or another phone instead. And these people aren’t likely to need a phone replacement for another year or two. Google also struck a deal to sell it through just one wireless carrier, Verizon. Although Google’s online store sold Pixels compatible with other wireless networks, most people don’t shop for phones that way. Of course, it’s a moot point if there weren’t enough Pixels to sell, but Google likely would have produced more if it had distribution deals with other carriers. It’s not surprising that Google misjudged the market, given that this is the search company’s first stab at making its own phone. Previously, it partnered with various manufacturers on a Nexus line of phones to showcase its Android operating system, but that effort barely made a dent. “This was probably a really good learning experience for them,” says Neil Doshi, an analyst with Mizhuo Securities USA. The Pixel’s success is important to Google because it wants to ensure there’s a stylish Android phone to compete with the iPhone and drive more affluent consumers to its search engine, maps, YouTube videos and other services. Samsung’s Galaxy and other phones also run on Android, but those devices have been de-emphasizing Google’s services. Google, which is based in Mountain View, California, can afford to make some mistakes as it tries to establish the Pixel because its internet search and advertising network brings in so much revenue. Alphabet, Google’s corporate parent, provided another reminder of its financial might with Thursday’s release of its fourth-quarter earnings. The company earned $5.3 billion on revenue of $26 billion during the final three months of last year. Even after subtracting commissions paid to Google’s ad partners, Alphabet’s revenue totaled $21 billion — a 23 percent increase from a year earlier. The company’s profit rose 8 percent from the prior year. Although Pixel sales weren’t disclosed, the numbers provided a clue on how the phone did. Google’s “other revenue” segment, which covers all sales outside of advertising, generated $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter, a 62 percent increase from the same time last year. Some of those gains came from sales of Google’s new internet-connected speaker, Home, and its business software services, but Doshi believes most of the increase was generated by the Pixel. He estimates Google sold 1 million to 1.5 million Pixels during the fourth quarter. That’s still just a sliver of the estimated 77 million that Apple sold during the same period (Apple is scheduled to release its numbers Tuesday). Pixel sales are also well below the roughly 15 million Galaxy S7 that Samsung sold during that device’s first quarter on the market. Still, analysts say the Pixel did exceptionally well for a new phone with little brand recognition. “Without question, Google has a hit on its hands and is building a platform for success,” says Jeff Moore, principal of Wave7 Research. Wave7 estimates that Pixel accounted for 12 percent of activations in December compared with 51 percent for iPhones and 26 percent for Samsung devices. Localytics, which tracks app activity on nearly 2 billion smartphones, also reported Pixel activations have steadily increased since sales began, especially around the Thanksgiving weekend and the holidays. “It looks like it has the potential to be a strong competitor to the likes of Apple and Samsung,” says Josh Todd, Localytics’ chief marketing officer.

If you’re going into the city to see a movie, you can now check Google Maps for a small icon that tells you how much trouble you’re likely to have finding a spot. Don't Miss: Google Pixel 2: Detailed report reveals potential specs, budget model “To see how hard it might be to park where you’re headed, just get directions to your destination and look for the parking difficulty icon in the directions card at the bottom of the screen,” Google explains. “Parking difficulties range from limited to medium to easy and are based on historical parking data.” Without a doubt, this is one of the more clever and interesting additions to Google Maps in recent memory, but there’s a catch. Like many new features, the parking difficulty indicator will only show up if you live in one of the twenty five cities that Google chose for the initial rollout of the feature. This is the current list of all the cities where the parking difficulty feature has rolled out: San Francisco, Seattle, Miami, Atlanta, Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, Minneapolis/St. Paul, New York City, Orlando, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, San Diego, St. Louis, Tampa, Washington, DC, Cleveland, Dallas/Fort Worth, Denver, Houston, Phoenix, Portland, Sacramento As you can see, only major metro areas are able to access the feature for now, but more cities should join the list eventually.

Home World news Alphabet quarterly profit misses estimates, shares fall Alphabet quarterly profit misses estimates, shares fall Google parent Alphabet Inc posted fourth-quarter profit below analysts' estimates on Thursday, increasing pressure on the company to deliver on new bets in hardware and cloud computing as its advertising business matures. By: Reuters | Published: January 27, 2017 5:20 AM Google parent Alphabet Inc posted fourth-quarter profit below analysts’ estimates on Thursday, increasing pressure on the company to deliver on new bets in hardware and cloud computing as its advertising business matures. (Reuters) Google parent Alphabet Inc posted fourth-quarter profit below analysts’ estimates on Thursday, increasing pressure on the company to deliver on new bets in hardware and cloud computing as its advertising business matures. While advertising still accounts for the lion’s share of Google’s revenue, rising 17.4 percent to $22.4 billion in the fourth quarter, Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat underscored that the company is diversifying its business, pointing to growth in hardware, app sales and the cloud business. The company’s other revenue, which captures such businesses, climbed 62 percent. “We see tremendous potential ahead for these businesses, as well as in the continued development of non-advertising revenue streams for YouTube,” Porat said on a call with investors. She spotlighted the company’s line of Nest smart home products, saying sales doubled during the key holiday period including Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Google-branded hardware also showed promise as Google Home, a smart speaker, and the Pixel smartphone gained traction over the holidays, Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said during the call. “We’re committed to this for the long term as a great way to bring a beautiful, seamless Google experience to people,” he said. The company posted a stronger-than-expected 22.2 percent increase in quarterly revenue as advertisers spent more to reach an expanding user base that spends more time on smartphones and YouTube. Despite the slight miss on earnings per share, analyst Kerry Rice of Needham and Company said the strong revenue growth suggests that Google’s core business remains healthy.”The top line indicated that the growth fundamentals are still well intact for the business,” he said. Research firm eMarketer has estimated that Google will capture $60.92 billion in search ad revenue this year, or 58.8 percent of the search ad market worldwide. Paid clicks, or clicks on Google ads, rose 36 percent, compared with a 33 percent increase in the third quarter. Paid clicks are those ads on which an advertiser pays only if a user clicks on them. Analysts on average had expected a rise of 26.9 percent, according to FactSet StreetAccount.Cost-per-click dropped 9 percent, a slide that has continued as Google sells more mobile ads, which command lower prices. However, the shift is not necessarily alarming as it suggests Google is selling more ads on YouTube, which are seen as a key growth driver, Rice said. Alphabet’s Other Bets revenue increased to $262 million from $150 million a year earlier, while the operating loss of $1.09 billion narrowed from $1.21 billion. Other Bets includes broadband business Google Fiber, home automation products Nest, self-driving technology company Waymo as well as X, the company’s research facility that works on “moon shot” ventures. Alphabet’s net income rose to $5.33 billion, or $7.56 per Class A and B share and Class C capital stock, in the fourth quarter, from $4.92 billion, or $7.06 per share, a year earlier. See graphic on earnings: Excluding items, the company earned $9.36 per share, below the average estimate of $9.64 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company’s consolidated revenue rose to $26.06 billion above the average estimate of $25.26 billion. Shares of the company fell 3 percent to $832 in extended trade after closing at $856.98 on Nasdaq. Please Wait while comments are loading...

 Google's CEO didn't have a very convincing answer for a potentially huge weakness in the company's business Steve Kovach Jan. 26, 2017, 6:45 PM 77,365 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google CEO Sundar Pichai.AP If Google has one weak spot right now, it's voice-based computing. And on Thursday's fourth-quarter earnings call, Wall Street analysts cut right to the chase, asking Google executives whether the company was at risk from the growing popularity of voice-enabled devices, which lack the screens on which Google's online ads rely. Google CEO Sundar Pichai sought to tamp down the concerns, telling analysts on the call that Google was "comfortable" about the way things would play out over the coming years. But Pichai didn't provide any details about how Google planned to evolve its ad business into the world of voice-based computing. Instead, he tried to assure his audience that the threat wasn't as big as some might expect. Sure, voice-enabled gadgets like the Amazon Echo and Google's own Home device don't have screens — eliminating the online ads that account for the vast majority of Google's revenue. But in Pichai's view, that doesn't necessarily mean screens are going away altogether. Voice will be only "one mode," he said. "Users will have many different ways by which they interact" with computers. It's still "early days" for voice-based computing, Pichai added. And he stressed that Google's years of experience working on natural language search and speech recognition gave his company a big edge over the competition. The Google Home speaker.Hollis Johnson/Business Insider Still, the fact is that Google is at an inherent disadvantage when it comes to voice computing. The big player in voice computing right now is Amazon, which sells the Amazon Echo speaker as well as a slew of new and coming products with the Alexa voice assistant built in. Amazon doesn't need to make money from search ads. Instead, it can use Alexa as a way to encourage users to buy more stuff from Amazon and sign up for services like Amazon Prime. Google makes its own voice-enabled gadgets to compete with the Echo, called the Home. The problem is that Google can sell plenty of Home devices, but they won't make up for the bigger loss of ad revenue if voice really catches on and the world moves away from screens. Google needs to figure out a new type of ad or a new business model. Just trust us If there's a plan, Google is keeping it close to the vest and hoping that investors won't worry too much. "We think about it from a long-term perspective," Pichai said. "So I see more opportunity than challenge when I think about voice search." And yes, Google has successfully navigated a major platform shift before — to smartphones from desktop computers. So Google defenders will argue that the company deserves the benefit of the doubt. But that was a shift to a small screen from a big screen. Now the world may be going to no screen. And as voice-enabled devices like the Echo become more popular, the questions on conference calls are sure to become more frequent. It may be time for Google to start preparing a better answer.

Responsible for authenticating the identity of websites, Google Trust Services will operate certificates on behalf of Google and Alphabet. The company has already been operating its own subordinate Certificate Authority (GIAG2) to more rapidly handle the SSL/TLS certificate needs of its products. Google is now expanding on those efforts with its own Root Certificate Authority. With Google Trust Services, the company is taking ownership of the highest level in the security structure used to authenticate a website’s identity. Specifically, it is used to sign other subordinate certificates. Google’s current ones have been issued by a third-party and will continue to be operated to hasten the transition to an independent structure. To further speed up the process of embedding Root Certificates into products, Google is purchasing two existing Root Certificate Authorities, GlobalSign R2 and R4. These acquisitions will allow “independent certificate issuance sooner rather than later.” End users should not see a disruption, but developers building products that interact with Google services will have to include the new Root Certificates.

Twitter Facebook IBM brings Google's AI tools to its powerful computers IBM is integrating the open-souce TensorFlow into its PowerAI toolkit Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 26 January, 2017 16:00 - - - - print email Comments Google has cool technology to recognize images and speech, and IBM's hardware can diagnose diseases and beat humans in Jeopardy. Combine the two, and you get a powerful computer with serious brains. IBM is merging Google's artificial intelligence tools with its own cognitive computing technologies, allowing deep-learning systems to more accurately find answers to complex questions or recognize images or voices. Google's open-source TensorFlow machine-learning tools are being packed into IBM's PowerAI, which is a toolkit for computer learning. The two can be combined to improve machine learning on IBM's Power servers. A computer learns as more data fed into its system, much like how a human learns.  PowerAI and TensorFlow tools can help track patterns and classify data, and spit out approximate answers to queries. The answers will be more accurate as a computer learns more. IBM already has Watson, which uses advanced software and hardware to find answers to complex questions. But PowerAI is more customizable compared to Watson, which is more of a pre-packaged set of hardware, software, and cloud technologies targeted at use models like medicine and finance. Integrating TensorFlow into PowerAI will solve a big problem of installing Google's machine-learning technologies on Power systems, said Sumit Gupta, vice president of high-performance computing and analytics at IBM. Right now, customers have to download TensorFlow from Google's site and install it separately, which can be time-consuming. The optimization of TensorFlow for PowerAI will make provide a hassle-free way of installing TensorFlow, Gupta said. Google also upgrades TensorFlow every month or so, and keeping up is a headache for customers, Gupta said. IBM will update PowerAI with the latest TensorFlow tools every quarter. IBM isn't creating a fork of TensorFlow for PowerAI, though that could be on the roadmap, Gupta said. The company has created a version of the open-source Caffe deep-learning framework for its PowerAI toolkit. Forking TensorFlow to work with specific hardware or applications is commonplace. Specific versions of TensorFlow have been created for use with GPUs from Nvidia, embedded devices, robots, and drones. Integrating and optimizing TensorFlow for PowerAI also speeds up machine-learning. The new PowerAI is designed for IBM Power Systems S822LC server, which has the speedy Nvidia NVlink interconnect to connect to GPUs, where most of the computer learning takes place. The NVlink is faster than the PCI-Express 3.0 interface on most servers today. The S822LC server is designed to work with Nvidia's Tesla P100 GPU. Those who don't own IBM hardware but want to test the latest version of PowerAI with TensorFlow can do so on a cloud service provided by Nimbix. Beyond computer learning, PowerAI can help in fraud detection or recommendation engines, especially for shopping. As a computer learns from input, patterns, and classifications, it'll be more adept at identifying suspicious transactions, which is valued by financial institutions, Gupta said. The recommendations engine can help online stores sell more products. PowerAI is not as popular as Watson, which became famous as a high-powered computer that beat a human in jeopardy. But PowerAI, TensorFlow, and Watson overlap, and also complement each other to build powerful learning models, Gupta said. A company using Watson may plug in TensorFlow or PowerAI for specific computer-learning tasks. Many machine-learning frameworks like Caffe, Torch, and Theano are now integrated into PowerAI.

Jänner 2017, 06:00 4 Postings "Bad Ads"-Bericht des Onlinewerberiesen: 1,7 Milliarden Banner gelöscht – Doppelt so viel Werbung wie 2015 Mountain View/Wien – Die Information zu Fake News und anderen irreführenden – quasi redaktionellen – Inhalten steht weit unten im alljährlichen Google-Report, der sich eigentlich den Bad Ads widmet, die der globale Onlinewerberiese im Vorjahr gelöscht hat. 200 Seitenbetreiber sperrte Google demnach dauerhaft von seiner Werbevermarktung. Erst im November 2016, nach der US-Präsidentenwahl, hat Google seine Nutzungsbedingungen in Sachen Fake News verschärft: Sie richten sich einerseits gegen Webseiten, die etwa vortäuschen, sie wären Info-Portale, und Seiten mit irreführenden Inhalten. Fake News, Fake Publishers: 340 in zwei Monaten Im November und Dezember 2016 hat Google nach eigenen Angaben 550 Seiten geprüft, die im Verdacht standen, falsche Inhalte zu veröffentlichen und/oder so zu tun, als wären sie Medienseiten. Gegen 340 dieser 550 Portale wurde Google nach eigenen Angaben wegen Fake News oder anderer Verstöße gegen die (neue) Policy aktiv. "Fast 200" der Betreiber wurden laut Google von dessen Werbevermarktung "dauerhaft ausgeschlossen" – eine eher höfliche Übersetzung von "kicked out". Abgedreht: 1,7 Milliarden Werbe-Aktivitäten Kicked out hat Google 2016 nach eigenen Angaben auch 1,7 Milliarden Werbemittel, mehr als doppelt soviele wie 2015. Google führt diese doch recht dramatische Steigerung zurück auf erweiterte Geschäftsbedingungen gegen irreführende und täuschende Werbung. Verschärft wurden demnach auch die technischen Vorkehrungen gegen "trick to click"-Fenster, die Google als "Ads" klassifiziert: Sie sehen aus wie Warnungen des Betriebssystems, die zum Klicken auffordern und dann Schadsoftware installieren. Der Google-Report kündet von 112 Millionen solcher – entdeckter – "Ads", sechsmal soviele wie 2015.

From today on, any develop who wishes to connect to a Google service will need to two root certificates specified by Google. The search giant and the world's most popular website is also now its own root certificate authority (CA). Google says the reason it’s established its root certificate authority (CA) is because it believes HTTPS, a protocol that encrypts communications between users and websites, is key to the future of a more secure web. “As we look forward to the evolution of both the web and our own products it is clear HTTPS will continue to be a foundational technology. This is why we have made the decision to expand our current Certificate Authority efforts to include the operation of our own Root Certificate Authority,” Ryan Hurst, a security and privacy engineer at Google, said in a blog post. Google has created a new company called Google Trust Services (GTS) LLC, which operates its own certificate authorities on behalf of Google and its parent company, Alphabet. GTS now oversees all of Google’s public key infrastructure and the issuance of digital security certificates. While it will allow Google to accelerate the move to HTTPS for its own products, it also gives it fuller control over certificates for Google domains, enabling it to revoke them if necessary. Google will, for example, oversee the process of validating private encryption keys held by website operators that are seeking a certificate. Should anyone try to get a certificate for a Google domain, it could deny the application. Google has in the past reacted strongly to rogue and error-prone CA’s that have issued certificates for Google domains, which allowed certificate holders to spoof its sites and intercept user communications. It follows a recently discovered blunder by Symantec, one of the largest CAs, in issuing several certificates to domains without the domain owner’s knowledge. Google last year also threatened to distrust Symantec-issued certificates in Chrome after it wrongly issued certificates for several Google domains. Had Google followed through with the threat, sites that used Symantec’s certificates would have been flagged as not safe. On several occasions CAs have given cause for distrust in their role in securing the web. Mozilla, the maker of Firefox, last year distrusted Chinese CA WoSign, for dubious behavior and before that distrusted Chinese government CA, CNNIC, for issuing certificates that undermined trust. Reactions on Y-combinator's Hacker News to Google becoming its own CA are mixed. “You can now have a website secured by a certificate issued by a Google CA, hosted on Google web infrastructure, with a domain registered using Google Domains, resolved using Google Public DNS, going over Google Fiber, in Google Chrome on a Google Chromebook. Google has officially vertically integrated the Internet,” wrote one user. On the other hand, what other company is better placed to verify Google domains than Google? “Instead of a third-party you trust (or rather, your user-agent trusts) vouching that Google's indeed Google, it's now Google vouching for itself, and you trust them by the virtue that they're Google. This ought not be surprising: presumably, who better to say that Google is indeed Google than Google itself?” To launch its new certificate authority, Google acquired several root certificates from GMO GlobalSign last August and took full control of them in December. It’s now published them on its own site. “Prior to 11 August 2016, the Roots R2, R4, GTS Root R1, GTS Root R2, GTS Root R3 and GTS Root R4 were operated by GMO GlobalSign, Inc. according to GMO GlobalSign, Inc.’s Certificate Policy and Certification Practice Statement. Between 11 August 2016 and 8 December 2016, Google Inc. operated these Roots according to Google Inc.’s Certification Practice Statement. As of 9 December 2016, Google Trust Services LLC operates these Roots under Google Trust Services LLC’s Certificate Policy and Certification Practice Statement,” Google says its certificate policy document. Hurst notes that going forward, any product that connects to Google property will need to to include the GS Root R3 and GeoTrust certificates.

Updated: January 27, 2017 @ 10:53 pm Full Forecast News Sports Obituaries Opinion Buy & Sell AP Business Highlights By The Associated Press Jan 26, 2017 Updated Jan 26, 2017 0 ___ For most Americans, Dow 20,000 carries little benefit WASHINGTON (AP) — While Wall Street celebrates yet another stock market record — surpassing 20,000 on the Dow Jones industrial average — many Americans have little reason to cheer. Despite the spread of 401(k) retirement plans, the wealthiest 10 percent of households own roughly 80 percent of stock market wealth. The Dow's 23 percent surge over the past year has benefited mostly investors who were already well-off. The rising concentration of wealth at the top is one reason why the economy's significant gains since the Great Recession ended 7½ years ago haven't been felt by many Americans. Though the Dow more than doubled in President Barack Obama's two terms, pay growth was stagnant, especially for people without higher education or high-tech skills. Discontent and anxiety about the economy's direction helped fuel President Donald Trump's election victory. ____ Slow fix: VW diesel owners complain of buyback delays DETROIT (AP) — Volkswagen's efforts to do right by owners who unknowingly purchased cars and SUVs that cheat on emissions tests have run into some speed bumps. Owners say the company isn't delivering on a promise to quickly buy back their vehicles. Some complain about multiple requests for paperwork, even after being told their application was complete. The German automaker acknowledges some hiccups, but blames delays on an overwhelming volume of buyback requests. A company lawyer told the judge handling the VW case that almost 400,000 owners had applied to have their vehicles repurchased in the three months since a legal settlement was approved. ___ Ford CEO hopeful that Trump will ease gas mileage standards DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) — Ford Motor Co.'s top executive is hopeful that President Donald Trump could ease government fuel economy requirements and reduce corporate taxes to help the auto industry grow and create jobs. The comments from Chief Executive Mark Fields came Thursday, two days after he and his counterparts at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and General Motors Co. met with Trump at the White House. Fields said on a conference call after Ford announced its 2016 earnings that they discussed emissions and gas mileage requirements that were finalized by the Environmental Protection Agency in the waning days of the Obama administration. "We may see some actions on that which could be positive for our business," Fields said. ___ US new-home sales tumble in December WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans pulled back sharply from buying new homes in December, but sales for all of 2016 were the highest since 2007. The Commerce Department said Thursday that new-home sales last month fell 10.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate 536,000. But sales totaled 563,000 in 2016, up 12.2 percent over the past year. Much of the sales growth during 2016 came from low mortgage rates and a steadily improving job market. But 2017 begins with some of that momentum possibly stalling as mortgage rates have risen since the November presidential election, worsening affordability and potentially curbing sales growth as more buyers cope with affordability issues. ___ J&J to spend $30 billion on Swiss drugmaker Actelion Johnson & Johnson will buy Swiss drugmaker Actelion in a $30 billion deal that both secures promising research and bolsters the product portfolio controlled by the U.S. health care giant. Much of Actelion's research operation will be spun off into a separate company in which J&J will own a minority stake. The U.S. conglomerate will then buy Actelion's seven drugs that are currently on the market and two potential treatments in late-stage testing. ___ Your cable company wants to be your phone company, too NEW YORK (AP) — Your TV provider may soon become your phone company. Which seems only fair, because your phone company also wants to be your TV provider. In the next few months, cable giant Comcast will start selling wireless service, just as AT&T and Verizon already do. Charter, the No. 2 cable company, also has a mobile plan. Meanwhile, the largest wireless carriers — AT&T and Verizon — have launched digital TV services. The wireless companies are also developing a faster, more reliable version of the mobile internet that could compete with cable's broadband. ___ Google's Pixel phone shines despite misgauging demand SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The Pixel phone, Google's answer to Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy, is off to a promising start — but might have done even better had Google managed consumer demand as smartly as the device's sleek design. Although Google hasn't released sales figures, industry researchers say the Pixel has been a hot item since its October debut was greeted with mostly glowing reviews and the biggest marketing blitz in Google's 18-year history. But there were missed opportunities. Google didn't have enough Pixels available to meet demand. Rather than wait several weeks, many consumers interested in the Pixel probably bought an iPhone, Galaxy or another phone instead. And these people aren't likely to need a phone replacement for another year or two. ___ Average US 30-year mortgage rate rises to 4.19 percent WASHINGTON (AP) — Long-term US mortgage rates rose this week after three weeks of declines, marking their first increase of the year. Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday the rate on 30-year fixed-rate loans climbed to an average 4.19 percent from 4.09 percent last week. That was still sharply higher than a 30-year rate that averaged 3.65 percent for all of 2016, the lowest level recorded from records going back to 1971. A year ago, the benchmark rate stood at 3.79 percent. The average for a 15-year mortgage increased to 3.40 percent from 3.34 percent last week. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average rose 32.40 points, or 0.2 percent, to 20,100.91. The S&P 500 index fell 1.69 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,296.68. The Nasdaq slid 1.16 points, or 0.02 percent, to 5,655.18. Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose $1.03, or 2 percent, to close at $53.78 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, gained $1.16, or 2.1 percent, to close at $56.24 a barrel in London. Wholesale gasoline rose 2 cents to $1.54 a gallon, while heating oil added 3 cents to $1.64 a gallon. Natural gas futures rose 5 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $3.38 per 1,000 cubic feet.

But its other wild bets are starting to make more money. Tech Industry by Richard Nieva January 26, 2017 1:37 PM PST @richardjnieva Up Next Beautiful scene shows universe is growing quicker than we knew Google has been scaling back on some of its moon shots. Justin Sullivan, Getty Images In the past few years, Google has become known for more than just its iconic search engine. You know, the one that tells you at a moment's notice the population of San Diego or what movie won the best picture Oscar in 1952 (1.3 million and "An American in Paris," respectively). It's also become known for its Jetson's-like ambitions: cars shuttling people around sans human drivers, high-flying balloons that beam Wi-Fi to remote regions, and nanoparticles that aim to detect cancer in early stages. When you describe something as "googley" in Silicon Valley, people know what you mean -- whimsical, scientific and with a dash of free food. It looks like some of those moon shots, called "Other Bets" in Google parlance, are starting to pay off. Google's parent company, Alphabet, said Thursday that, as a whole, those bets made $260 million in sales in the fourth quarter, compared to $150 million the year before. The costs associated with those bets also fell: The company spent $1.08 billion on Other Bets in the fourth quarter, versus $1.21 billion in the same period the year before. Alphabet also gave us a snapshot of how its business is doing overall. In the three months ended December 31, it recorded $26.06 billion in sales, surpassing analyst forecasts of $25.22 billion. Profit, after some costs, was $9.36 a share, falling short of analyst expectations of $9.67 per share. "We're seeing great momentum in Google's newer investment areas and ongoing strong progress in Other Bets," Ruth Porat, Alphabet's CFO, said in a statement. Moon shots downed In the last few months, Google has stepped up scrutiny of its moon shots, with some of them shut down or scaled back. There are a few reasons for that. Failure comes with the territory. Astro Teller, who runs the X lab, the self-described moon shot factory that develops most of the company's secretive projects, touts a now-cliched mantra: "Fail fast." "We work hard at X to make it safe to fail," Teller said during a keynote speech at South by Southwest last year. "We killed over 100 investigations last year alone." Another likely reason is Porat, chief money minder. A Morgan Stanley veteran, she arrived in March 2015 to great fanfare. "Ruthless Ruth," as she's reportedly called among Google's rank and file, is apparently notorious for cutting projects deemed too expensive or that haven't captured the excitement of Alphabet CEO Larry Page. "The internal transparency we've provided to our business leaders across the Other Bets and Google is helping us to allocate resources more thoughtfully across the opportunities that we see," Porat said during a conference call with analysts Thursday. It's hard to argue with her calls. After her first earnings report on the job, Google's market value swelled by $60 billion the next day, the biggest one-day gain for any company in history. But while that's no doubt tickled Wall Street, it's come at the expense of some of those pie-in-the-sky, dare-to-dream projects. Among some of the scaled-back efforts: the robotics division. It was started by Android creator Andy Rubin, who built it up thanks to an acquisition spree that included at least 11 companies in 2013. But after Rubin left Google in 2014, the effort was rudderless. The robotics division was eventually swallowed up by X, before Teller put the kibosh on it completely. The company also decided to halt expansion of its high-speed internet service, called Fiber, though it will continue operations in eight cities where it's already in place. Google also scaled back its efforts with drones and is now mostly focusing on trying to use them as a delivery service for things like pizza and groceries instead of for spreading internet connectivity. "As we reach for moon shots that will have a big impact in the longer-term, it's inevitable that there will be course corrections along the way," Porat said in October. "Some efforts will be more successful than others." CNET Magazine: Check out a sampling of the stories you'll find in CNET's newsstand edition.

USA TODAY Sports Wisconsin basketball player Bronson Koenig is an activist in the Native American community. (Photo: Benny Sieu, USA TODAY Sports) MADISON, Wis. — Google Maps told the Koenig brothers the trip to Standing Rock would take nine hours. But Google didn’t know how how many donated items — warm clothing, camping supplies and dry food — filled the 18-foot trailer they drove, slowing them down for all the right reasons. They put a flag for their Ho-Chunk tribe on the trailer, so it could fly alongside them as they drove. It took the brothers 14 hours on that September weekend to get from Madison to the camp in North Dakota, to the Standing Rock Sioux reservation that had filled with Native Americans from more than 300 tribes in RVs, tents and teepees who had come together to protest the building of the Dakota Access Pipeline. The tribe and supporters say the $3.7 billion pipeline will destroy Native American burial grounds and could contaminate the reservation’s water supply. Bronson Koenig, the University of Wisconsin basketball star, and his brother Miles joined the protest. USA TODAY Bronson Koenig turns to celebrity trainer to get in best shape of his life USA TODAY What Wisconsin star Bronson Koenig's tattoos mean Their visit that weekend was short but overwhelming in its impact. Koenig had planned to put on a basketball camp for kids at the local high school, but there were so many others who couldn’t afford to come or couldn’t get rides to the school, Miles said, that Bronson ended up hosting a smaller informal clinic first — for about 50 kids, at the outdoor hoop. As he watched his younger brother put on these free camps and saw so many Native children asking questions, hoping to be like him when they were older, Miles became overwhelmed by emotion. “I saw them all just in awe of him,” Miles said. “It hit me then. It made me tear up.” Wisconsin guard Bronson Koenig is having an All-American-caliber season as a senior.  (Photo: Jordan Johnson, USA TODAY Sports) Bronson was not just an inspiration to the hundreds of kids he spoke to at Standing Rock. He was a role model for all Native Americans, someone to look up to in a community that has lacked people to emulate. “I didn't expect he would ever be like that, but he is, and I don't really know how to explain it, but it's really cool,” Miles said. “I’m really proud of him.” Though basketball itself seems to pale in comparison to a fight that continues against the construction of a pipeline — President Trump this week signed an executive order aimed to clear the path for the controversial oil pipeline’s completion — the sport has actually has benefited from it. As Koenig, 22, has grown into an activist and role model that those around him couldn’t have foreseen years ago, he also has grown into arguably Wisconsin’s most important player. *** Three and a half years ago, just a couple of days into his freshman year at Wisconsin, Koenig was approached by a professor in a hallway. All Don Stanley knew about Koenig was that a he was Ho-Chunk. Stanley asked him about the Ho-Chunk wellness center near La Crosse, Wis., Koenig’s hometown, a conversation starter that would lead to a friendship. “I don't think we've ever talked basketball actually,” said Stanley, who teaches design and digital marketing. “I’m a sports fan, of course, but I’m more of a fan of each of my students as people and getting to know them.” Wisconsin guard Bronson Koenig has seen his game flourish while working as an activist in the Native American community off the court.  (Photo: Benny Sieu, USA TODAY Sports) Stanley had become active in Native communities, first educating himself on the past and then figuring out ways to help. Education is always the starting point. Even Koenig needed to begin there, with the history of his own tribe being forcibly relocated in the 19th century. Koenig’s mother, Ethel Funmaker, is 100% Ho-Chunk; his father is white. Koenig is a light-skinned Native American who grew up in a city and took occasional visits to Black River Falls, the tribe’s headquarters. Taken together, as he put it to Stanley once the two grew close, he felt “like a minority within a minority.” Koenig didn’t know where he fit in. “It took a lot of bravery to talk about that, and him struggling with a sense of ‘Who am I?’ ” Stanley said. “You get that with a lot of Native people who don't grow up on reservations. Suicide rates, alcoholism and substance abuse rates are really, really high, and I think a lot of it stems from that sense of struggle with identity.” It’s a struggle Koenig openly discusses now, and it’s a feeling that may always resonate on some level. But Koenig continued to learn, signing up and taking American Indian Studies courses at Wisconsin. He asked his mother questions he hadn’t asked before. “She’s more laid-back, really quiet, more reserved,” he said. These topics hadn’t come up this way before, even though she works for the tribe in the executive building. “I’ve always wanted to know more,” Koenig said. But that didn’t necessarily mean he planned on becoming the face of the Native American community, even with his mother’s involvement. She took him to speak to Native schools, even when he hated public speaking. She helped him realize he could be the role model he never had as a kid. When asked who he looked up to as a Native American kid, he paused. “There wasn’t really any,” Koenig said. “Jim Thorpe, I guess, but he was so long ago. And I play basketball.” Bronson Koenig, a Native American community activist, shows one of his meaningful tattoos.  (Photo: Benny Sieu, USA TODAY Sports) Far more common than role models were cautionary tales, of promising Native athletes waylaid by alcohol or depression. But maybe that’s changing. When Koenig stood up in front of all those kids in Standing Rock, he felt their eyeballs on him. He felt their hope. He felt their future. “He's still trying to gain clarity in his own life, but to see that those kids weren't judging him, they were just seeing him as somebody they can aspire to be like,” Stanley said. “As he continues to get more familiar and more comfortable with who he is, both with his European heritage as well as his Ho-Chunk heritage, I think he'll start to shine even more. That's a process and I think all of us go through that. Who are we? What are we about? Why are we here? I think Native people tend to go on a deeper struggle because of some of the history. “I’m sure he doesn't feel like a role model. That can be a burden for some people, but if you have the right support, which I think he's putting into place around him, it won't be a burden. It'll be a positive weight to carry. It'll be something that drives him to do better and be better in all areas of what he does.” ** That includes basketball. As Koenig has grasped a better understanding of his heritage, his activism and his sense of self, his basketball has flourished. His focus has narrowed in all areas of his life, as he’s figured out what he wants to prioritize. To achieve the goals he’s set for himself in basketball this, his senior year, and beyond, he knew he needed to get himself into better shape, and he needed to eat better. Wisconsin's Bronson Koenig, who played point guard in two Final Fours, has made a name for himself on and off the court now.  (Photo: Benny Sieu, USA TODAY Sports) This past summer, he hired celebrity trainer Corey Calliet — he’s the one who whipped Michael B. Jordan into shape for Creed — to work with him in Los Angeles for two months. Calliet also sent Koenig a meal plan to follow. He started making sure he got enough rest as well. By the time Koenig attended the Under Armour All-America camp in July, he’d noticeably leaned out. A referee complimented him on his more chiseled physique, an outward manifestation of the change he felt inside, too. “I could feel it 100%, just everything,” Koenig said. “When you eat healthy, you just feel better. Your mindset, everything, feels better. That's kind of how I felt. I didn't really get tired on the court. I was quicker, more explosive, jumping way higher.” It helped, too, that Koenig had time to recover from a knee bruise sustained last season that turned into tendinitis and didn’t fully heal until this fall. Head coach Greg Gard said he believes the sense of urgency that comes along with a player heading into his final season contributes, too — in a good way. “Like, ‘What else can I do to make myself have the best senior year possible?’ ” Gard said. “They can see the light at the end of the tunnel. It’s coming to an end sooner rather than later. … For older players, it’s part of a growth and maturity process.” Said senior forward Nigel Hayes: “This is the biggest jump in skill level I've seen Bronson make in our four years here together. He took this offseason 100 times more seriously than he has other previous offseasons. You can see it in his work ethic now. … He's not letting other people distract him from basketball now. Some of that could be attributed to knowing it's his senior year so this is it, but I think it's got a lot to do with his awakening as far as, not only with his Native American history but him wanting to reach his goals. “He's finally hitting that maturity level that he needs in order to accomplish his goals and things he wants.” Perhaps more than any other college basketball coach in the nation, Gard has been willing to allow his players to grow both on and off the court. Hayes, too, uses his platform as a well-known college basketball star to advocate for change both with social justice issues, like the treatment of African-Americans by police, and within the NCAA system regarding unpaid student-athletes. Wisconsin guard Bronson Koenig, shown here with coach Greg Gard, is averaging 14.6 points a game this season.  (Photo: Mary Langenfeld, USA TODAY Sports) Gard has supported both of his stars as they’ve taken on their roles as activists. He met with Koenig before Koenig drove to Standing Rock to talk about why he was going, and what he would do to keep himself safe if the peaceful protest took a turn toward violence. Koenig had thought everything through, and he wanted to go make a difference. So he did. “Everybody can point at what the problem is," Gard said, "but not everybody is taking a step toward being part of the solution." *** March is little more than a month away, and the Badgers are 17-3 (6-1 in Big Ten play), tied atop the league’s standings. Koenig leads the team in scoring at 14.6 points a game. He’s shooting better — 45.6% from the field, 41.3% from beyond the arc — than he has at any point in his college career. Badgers sophomore forward Ethan Happ, who averages nearly a double-double, has emerged as a candidate for national player of the year and this week was named to the midseason watch list for the Oscar Robertson Trophy. But Koenig quietly has been the straw that stirs the Badgers, much like he has in the past. He’s a player who has played as integral a part in elevating this program to the nation’s elite as anyone. He’s been to two Final Fours, and he’d like to get to another. It would feel a little different, though, if Koenig were able to reach the sport’s biggest stage once again. No longer a reluctant role model, he would feel comfortable — well, as comfortable as he can be — in the spotlight, knowing what it means for Native American kids all over the country to see him there and knowing why that matters. He needs only to look down for a reminder. On his right pectoral muscle is a tattoo that reminds him that Ho-Chunks are fierce warriors. The intricate details of the headdress, the red war paint — the whole process took three hours. He got that tattoo last summer, and his other, a dreamcatcher along the side of his left rib cage, the summer before. And two years, two tattoos and one trip to Standing Rock later, he’s a different Bronson Koenig — but he's finally a Bronson Koenig he’s starting to truly understand.

Google and Tesla are manufacturing their own fleets of branded robo-cars, while Uber has plans to turn your existing car into an autonomous vehicle.  The truth is, with no firm regulations in place, and no current system of liability, no one knows what the future holds for self-driving cars . . . and the future is happening right now. The Idea Isn't New The first self-driving vehicle appears in the sketchbooks of Leonardo DaVinci. His spring-powered cart could "navigate" through a track of wooden blocks. The earliest model of DaVinci's cart was built in 1748. Zooming ahead in time, General Motors pushed the concept of an automated car early and often with it's FireBird Series in the 1950's. The look didn't catch on, but this version of automated driving built upon the success of DaVinci – the FireBird controlled steering by following a specially painted track on the road. Although the automated guidance feature was fresh, the FireBird was too futuristic looking. Thankfully, the self-driving car of the future may look very familiar. Your Car Could Become A Self-Driving Car Google and Tesla are currently in a manufacturing arms race to build fleets of branded, autonomous cars. Each company is investing millions in design, software, hardware, infrastructure, lobbying efforts, and research and development. But the self-driving cars of the future may not look like Google's computer pods, or Tesla's sleek robo-roadsters. Indeed, the car of the future may be your Honda Civic; just with a few special "enhancements." Uber's version of self-driving cars, hitting the streets last September in Pittsburgh,  are current Volvos that have been enhanced. Through an added on "kit" containing GPS, radar, and guidance capabilities that can see through solid objects, the Volvo of today magically becomes the smart car of tomorrow. Otto, a self-driving technology company founded by ex-Googlers, recently announced plans to release similar kits later this year. Their version attaches to any existing 16 wheel truck, making it autonomous within hours. Uber recently acquired Otto for over $600 million. The idea of self-driving cars has never been closer to reality. But many critics of the robot revolution on the roadways are unable to ignore the pending obstacles and the imminent dangers the technology presents. Most critics envision self-driving cars hitting the roads five, maybe even ten years in the future. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick begs to differ. "We are going commercial," he said in an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek. "This can't just be about science." No One Knows How This Is Going To Turn Out Some governments, like UK and New Zealand, are working on plans that accept autonomous vehicles on their roadways this year. In contrast, places known for their exotic traffic patterns, like India, Vietnam, and Rome – have significant obstacles in their way when it comes to allowing robot motorists on their streets. And what about insurance for your robot chauffeur? Does anyone have a plan for that? Answers? More like, more questions! "When it comes to self-driving cars and accidents, the questions of insurance and who's to blame, or liable, seem to be the most pressing," says Richard Rose, senior partner at The Sawaya Law Firm. He points to a scenario in Texas, where a man driving a Tesla in auto-pilot mode, crashed into a fence last year. "The driver may have admitted fault," says Rose, "but that's not stopping the insurance company from launching an inspection of the car, introducing the prospect of a suit against Tesla." Does that mean higher premiums for self-driving car owners? More lawsuits against smart-car manufacturers for defects? We will have these answers soon – but at what cost? From the 1700's to today, we've always been interested in innovation, and self-driving technology will ultimately make our roads safer. But the automation of transportation raises serious questions, that have yet to receive solid answers. And with new state laws passed that eliminate the requirement that a human operator be present when testing autonomous cars, the reality of our automated future may soon be pulling around your corner.

USA TODAY Sports Wisconsin basketball player Bronson Koenig is an activist in the Native American community. (Photo: Benny Sieu, USA TODAY Sports) MADISON, Wis. — Google Maps told the Koenig brothers the trip to Standing Rock would take nine hours. But Google didn’t know how how many donated items — warm clothing, camping supplies and dry food — filled the 18-foot trailer they drove, slowing them down for all the right reasons. They put a flag for their Ho-Chunk tribe on the trailer, so it could fly alongside them as they drove. It took the brothers 14 hours on that September weekend to get from Madison to the camp in North Dakota, to the Standing Rock Sioux reservation that had filled with Native Americans from more than 300 tribes in RVs, tents and teepees who had come together to protest the building of the Dakota Access Pipeline. The tribe and supporters say the $3.7 billion pipeline will destroy Native American burial grounds and could contaminate the reservation’s water supply. Bronson Koenig, the University of Wisconsin basketball star, and his brother Miles joined the protest. USA TODAY Bronson Koenig turns to celebrity trainer to get in best shape of his life USA TODAY What Wisconsin star Bronson Koenig's tattoos mean Their visit that weekend was short but overwhelming in its impact. Koenig had planned to put on a basketball camp for kids at the local high school, but there were so many others who couldn’t afford to come or couldn’t get rides to the school, Miles said, that Bronson ended up hosting a smaller informal clinic first — for about 50 kids, at the outdoor hoop. As he watched his younger brother put on these free camps and saw so many Native children asking questions, hoping to be like him when they were older, Miles became overwhelmed by emotion. “I saw them all just in awe of him,” Miles said. “It hit me then. It made me tear up.” Wisconsin guard Bronson Koenig is having an All-American-caliber season as a senior.  (Photo: Jordan Johnson, USA TODAY Sports) Bronson was not just an inspiration to the hundreds of kids he spoke to at Standing Rock. He was a role model for all Native Americans, someone to look up to in a community that has lacked people to emulate. “I didn't expect he would ever be like that, but he is, and I don't really know how to explain it, but it's really cool,” Miles said. “I’m really proud of him.” Though basketball itself seems to pale in comparison to a fight that continues against the construction of a pipeline — President Trump this week signed an executive order aimed to clear the path for the controversial oil pipeline’s completion — the sport has actually has benefited from it. As Koenig, 22, has grown into an activist and role model that those around him couldn’t have foreseen years ago, he also has grown into arguably Wisconsin’s most important player. *** Three and a half years ago, just a couple of days into his freshman year at Wisconsin, Koenig was approached by a professor in a hallway. All Don Stanley knew about Koenig was that a he was Ho-Chunk. Stanley asked him about the Ho-Chunk wellness center near La Crosse, Wis., Koenig’s hometown, a conversation starter that would lead to a friendship. “I don't think we've ever talked basketball actually,” said Stanley, who teaches design and digital marketing. “I’m a sports fan, of course, but I’m more of a fan of each of my students as people and getting to know them.” Wisconsin guard Bronson Koenig has seen his game flourish while working as an activist in the Native American community off the court.  (Photo: Benny Sieu, USA TODAY Sports) Stanley had become active in Native communities, first educating himself on the past and then figuring out ways to help. Education is always the starting point. Even Koenig needed to begin there, with the history of his own tribe being forcibly relocated in the 19th century. Koenig’s mother, Ethel Funmaker, is 100% Ho-Chunk; his father is white. Koenig is a light-skinned Native American who grew up in a city and took occasional visits to Black River Falls, the tribe’s headquarters. Taken together, as he put it to Stanley once the two grew close, he felt “like a minority within a minority.” Koenig didn’t know where he fit in. “It took a lot of bravery to talk about that, and him struggling with a sense of ‘Who am I?’ ” Stanley said. “You get that with a lot of Native people who don't grow up on reservations. Suicide rates, alcoholism and substance abuse rates are really, really high, and I think a lot of it stems from that sense of struggle with identity.” It’s a struggle Koenig openly discusses now, and it’s a feeling that may always resonate on some level. But Koenig continued to learn, signing up and taking American Indian Studies courses at Wisconsin. He asked his mother questions he hadn’t asked before. “She’s more laid-back, really quiet, more reserved,” he said. These topics hadn’t come up this way before, even though she works for the tribe in the executive building. “I’ve always wanted to know more,” Koenig said. But that didn’t necessarily mean he planned on becoming the face of the Native American community, even with his mother’s involvement. She took him to speak to Native schools, even when he hated public speaking. She helped him realize he could be the role model he never had as a kid. When asked who he looked up to as a Native American kid, he paused. “There wasn’t really any,” Koenig said. “Jim Thorpe, I guess, but he was so long ago. And I play basketball.” Bronson Koenig, a Native American community activist, shows one of his meaningful tattoos.  (Photo: Benny Sieu, USA TODAY Sports) Far more common than role models were cautionary tales, of promising Native athletes waylaid by alcohol or depression. But maybe that’s changing. When Koenig stood up in front of all those kids in Standing Rock, he felt their eyeballs on him. He felt their hope. He felt their future. “He's still trying to gain clarity in his own life, but to see that those kids weren't judging him, they were just seeing him as somebody they can aspire to be like,” Stanley said. “As he continues to get more familiar and more comfortable with who he is, both with his European heritage as well as his Ho-Chunk heritage, I think he'll start to shine even more. That's a process and I think all of us go through that. Who are we? What are we about? Why are we here? I think Native people tend to go on a deeper struggle because of some of the history. “I’m sure he doesn't feel like a role model. That can be a burden for some people, but if you have the right support, which I think he's putting into place around him, it won't be a burden. It'll be a positive weight to carry. It'll be something that drives him to do better and be better in all areas of what he does.” ** That includes basketball. As Koenig has grasped a better understanding of his heritage, his activism and his sense of self, his basketball has flourished. His focus has narrowed in all areas of his life, as he’s figured out what he wants to prioritize. To achieve the goals he’s set for himself in basketball this, his senior year, and beyond, he knew he needed to get himself into better shape, and he needed to eat better. Wisconsin's Bronson Koenig, who played point guard in two Final Fours, has made a name for himself on and off the court now.  (Photo: Benny Sieu, USA TODAY Sports) This past summer, he hired celebrity trainer Corey Calliet — he’s the one who whipped Michael B. Jordan into shape for Creed — to work with him in Los Angeles for two months. Calliet also sent Koenig a meal plan to follow. He started making sure he got enough rest as well. By the time Koenig attended the Under Armour All-America camp in July, he’d noticeably leaned out. A referee complimented him on his more chiseled physique, an outward manifestation of the change he felt inside, too. “I could feel it 100%, just everything,” Koenig said. “When you eat healthy, you just feel better. Your mindset, everything, feels better. That's kind of how I felt. I didn't really get tired on the court. I was quicker, more explosive, jumping way higher.” It helped, too, that Koenig had time to recover from a knee bruise sustained last season that turned into tendinitis and didn’t fully heal until this fall. Head coach Greg Gard said he believes the sense of urgency that comes along with a player heading into his final season contributes, too — in a good way. “Like, ‘What else can I do to make myself have the best senior year possible?’ ” Gard said. “They can see the light at the end of the tunnel. It’s coming to an end sooner rather than later. … For older players, it’s part of a growth and maturity process.” Said senior forward Nigel Hayes: “This is the biggest jump in skill level I've seen Bronson make in our four years here together. He took this offseason 100 times more seriously than he has other previous offseasons. You can see it in his work ethic now. … He's not letting other people distract him from basketball now. Some of that could be attributed to knowing it's his senior year so this is it, but I think it's got a lot to do with his awakening as far as, not only with his Native American history but him wanting to reach his goals. “He's finally hitting that maturity level that he needs in order to accomplish his goals and things he wants.” Perhaps more than any other college basketball coach in the nation, Gard has been willing to allow his players to grow both on and off the court. Hayes, too, uses his platform as a well-known college basketball star to advocate for change both with social justice issues, like the treatment of African-Americans by police, and within the NCAA system regarding unpaid student-athletes. Wisconsin guard Bronson Koenig, shown here with coach Greg Gard, is averaging 14.6 points a game this season.  (Photo: Mary Langenfeld, USA TODAY Sports) Gard has supported both of his stars as they’ve taken on their roles as activists. He met with Koenig before Koenig drove to Standing Rock to talk about why he was going, and what he would do to keep himself safe if the peaceful protest took a turn toward violence. Koenig had thought everything through, and he wanted to go make a difference. So he did. “Everybody can point at what the problem is," Gard said, "but not everybody is taking a step toward being part of the solution." *** March is little more than a month away, and the Badgers are 17-3 (6-1 in Big Ten play), tied atop the league’s standings. Koenig leads the team in scoring at 14.6 points a game. He’s shooting better — 45.6% from the field, 41.3% from beyond the arc — than he has at any point in his college career. Badgers sophomore forward Ethan Happ, who averages nearly a double-double, has emerged as a candidate for national player of the year and this week was named to the midseason watch list for the Oscar Robertson Trophy. But Koenig quietly has been the straw that stirs the Badgers, much like he has in the past. He’s a player who has played as integral a part in elevating this program to the nation’s elite as anyone. He’s been to two Final Fours, and he’d like to get to another. It would feel a little different, though, if Koenig were able to reach the sport’s biggest stage once again. No longer a reluctant role model, he would feel comfortable — well, as comfortable as he can be — in the spotlight, knowing what it means for Native American kids all over the country to see him there and knowing why that matters. He needs only to look down for a reminder. On his right pectoral muscle is a tattoo that reminds him that Ho-Chunks are fierce warriors. The intricate details of the headdress, the red war paint — the whole process took three hours. He got that tattoo last summer, and his other, a dreamcatcher along the side of his left rib cage, the summer before. And two years, two tattoos and one trip to Standing Rock later, he’s a different Bronson Koenig — but he's finally a Bronson Koenig he’s starting to truly understand.

It’s coming to an end sooner rather than later. … For older players, it’s part of a growth and maturity process.” Said senior forward Nigel Hayes: “This is the biggest jump in skill level I've seen Bronson make in our four years here together. He took this offseason 100 times more seriously than he has other previous offseasons. You can see it in his work ethic now. … He's not letting other people distract him from basketball now. Some of that could be attributed to knowing it's his senior year so this is it, but I think it's got a lot to do with his awakening as far as, not only with his Native American history but him wanting to reach his goals. “He's finally hitting that maturity level that he needs in order to accomplish his goals and things he wants.” Perhaps more than any other college basketball coach in the nation, Gard has been willing to allow his players to grow both on and off the court. Hayes, too, uses his platform as a well-known college basketball star to advocate for change both with social justice issues, like the treatment of African-Americans by police, and within the NCAA system regarding unpaid student-athletes. Wisconsin guard Bronson Koenig, shown here with coach Greg Gard, is averaging 14.6 points a game this season.  (Photo: Mary Langenfeld, USA TODAY Sports) Gard has supported both of his stars as they’ve taken on their roles as activists. He met with Koenig before Koenig drove to Standing Rock to talk about why he was going, and what he would do to keep himself safe if the peaceful protest took a turn toward violence. Koenig had thought everything through, and he wanted to go make a difference. So he did. “Everybody can point at what the problem is," Gard said, "but not everybody is taking a step toward being part of the solution." *** March is little more than a month away, and the Badgers are 17-3 (6-1 in Big Ten play), tied atop the league’s standings. Koenig leads the team in scoring at 14.6 points a game. He’s shooting better — 45.6% from the field, 41.3% from beyond the arc — than he has at any point in his college career. Badgers sophomore forward Ethan Happ, who averages nearly a double-double, has emerged as a candidate for national player of the year and this week was named to the midseason watch list for the Oscar Robertson Trophy. But Koenig quietly has been the straw that stirs the Badgers, much like he has in the past. He’s a player who has played as integral a part in elevating this program to the nation’s elite as anyone. He’s been to two Final Fours, and he’d like to get to another. It would feel a little different, though, if Koenig were able to reach the sport’s biggest stage once again. No longer a reluctant role model, he would feel comfortable — well, as comfortable as he can be — in the spotlight, knowing what it means for Native American kids all over the country to see him there and knowing why that matters. He needs only to look down for a reminder. On his right pectoral muscle is a tattoo that reminds him that Ho-Chunks are fierce warriors. The intricate details of the headdress, the red war paint — the whole process took three hours. He got that tattoo last summer, and his other, a dreamcatcher along the side of his left rib cage, the summer before. And two years, two tattoos and one trip to Standing Rock later, he’s a different Bronson Koenig — but he's finally a Bronson Koenig he’s starting to truly understand.

Revenue in the last three months of the year jumped 22 percent from a year earlier, reaching $26.1 billion, while net income rose 8 percent to $5.3 billion. “2016 was simply a great year for us,” said Ruth Porat, chief financial officer of Alphabet and Google, in a conference call with analysts. The vast majority of the quarter's revenue, $22.4 billion, came from Google's advertising business, with $3.4 billion coming from other business segments such as hardware sales, the Google Play Store and Google's Cloud services. Google's so-called "other bets," the fancy and fantastical projects such as self-driving cars, Google Fiber and internet from drones, contributed $262 million, up 75 percent. The other bets division curbed losses at $1.1 billion, slightly smaller the $1.2 billion it lost in the last three months of 2015. But despite the strong results, Wall Street was expecting better for the quarter. It had been hoping for earnings of about $9.67 per share, so the actual $9.36 per share was lower than expected. "2016 was a great year for Google, and 2017 is shaping up to be even more exciting," said Sundar Pichai, Google CEO, on the conference call. Pichai said 2016 stood out as the year artificial intelligence became central to Google's mission as a company. AI, which includes machine learning, has been used in services like Google Photos for a while, and in 2016 it expanded greatly with services like the Google Assistant. The Google Assistant allows users to make voice queries of Google. "It’s off to a great start," said Pichai. He said he was happy with Google's "big bets" on three technologies: YouTube is booming thanks to a focus on key content providers, Cloud is on a "terrific upswing" and more than 3 million companies are now paying for GSuite services, and Pichai said he was thrilled with the reception of the Pixel smartphone and Google Home device.

Alphabet earned less than expected during the quarter — partially due to the costs of a slew of new initiatives in its core business. Increased costs in its newly expanded hardware business, including the Pixel phone and Google Home personal assistant; spending on data centers amid its ambitious cloud push; and content acquisition for YouTube were among the main factors weighing on earnings, chief financial officer Ruth Porat said in a call with investors. Overall, cost of revenues increased from $8.19 billion a year ago to $10.66 billion in this year's fourth quarter, and went from 38 percent of revenue to 41 percent of revenue. While they hurt the bottom line, the nature of the costs are a change for a company that's historically splurged in far-reaching projects. Porat has been lauded on Wall Street for reining in Google's "moonshot" projects. The company posted fourth-quarter earnings per share of $9.36, adjusted and excluding items, on revenues of $26.06 billion on Thursday. Analysts expected $9.64 on $25.26 billion in revenue, according to a consensus estimate from Thomson Reuters. The company's traffic acquisition costs hit $4.8 billion during the quarter, up from a year ago and higher than the $4.7 billion expected by a StreetAccount estimate. Porat blamed the fact that Google's strongest growth areas, search and programmatic, "carry a higher acquisition cost." The company also saw a 29 percent increase in stock based compensation. Google CEO Sundar Pichai said there are two main areas of investment for YouTube: Improving the speed and searchability of the platform, and more original content, songs, and kids' shows. Meanwhile, Google's core search advertisements getting more clicks than before, but making less money from them. Google's costs-per-click — the amount it gets from advertisers— fell 16 percent year over year, more than the 11 percent expected by StreetAccount estimates. But eventually, ads on YouTube, and machine learning initiatives, could prove a transition point for Google. Forrester analyst Thomas Husson compared Google to Apple, as both companies are diversifying beyond their historical core businesses. "Apple is starting to generate meaningful service revenue while hardware revenue is decelerating," Forrester analyst Thomas Husson told CNBC in a statement. "On the contrary, Alphabet is investing to be less directly dependent on Google's core advertising business."

Laptops by Joshua Goldman 25 January 2017 7:00 am GMT @ByJoshG Up Next Meet Jon Hamm, the hologram (aka the holohamm) The Dell 3000 Series Latitude notebook is also available as a Chromebook. Dell Dell isn't playing favorites with its education laptops: All three of its new systems are available to run on Microsoft Windows 1o or Google Chrome. Both Microsoft and Google announced education initiatives this week and part of those was new low-cost laptops and convertibles made specifically for classroom use. For Dell that list includes the 11.6-inch Latitude 11 and Chromebook 11, the 13.3-inch Latitude 13 and Chromebook 13 and the 11.6-inch Latitude 11 Convertible and Chromebook 11 Convertible. All of the new systems are reinforced for shock protection and have rubberized base trim so they can better withstand a drop off a desk. They also have fully sealed keyboards and touchpads to protect against spills. Dell is promising all-day battery life from them, too. The convertibles are able to be used as a traditional notebook or with the screen rotated around 360 degrees and used as a tablet. The Windows version supports input with Dell's Productivity Active Pen so students can write and draw on the screen, and it has a world-facing camera that sits above the keyboard so that it can be used when the Latitude is in tablet mode. The Dell Chromebook 11 convertible's screen rotates 360 degrees from laptop to tablet. Dell For the other Latitude and Chromebook models, the screens have 180-degree lay-flat hinges making them easier for students to gather around. Other than their larger screen size, the 13-inch models are available with or without a touch display, can be configured with higher-performance Core i3 or Core i5 processors (the 11-inch models run on Pentium and Celeron CPUs) and are available with mobile broadband (Windows only) allowing students to stay connected when Wi-Fi isn't available. All of the systems are expected to be available in early February. Pricing was not announced. Alongside the laptops, Dell announced two 4K-resolution touch displays for use in classrooms or offices. Joining the company's current 70-inch 1080p interactive touch monitor, the 55- and 86-inch displays use a new InGlass technology for a natural writing experience using the two included passive styluses according to Dell. Also, although the displays have room on back for a Dell OptiPlex Micro desktop that can be powered off the display, a Dell spokesperson said they can be used with any computer. Both will be available at the end of March at a price below $5,000 for the Dell 55 (roughly converted to £4,000 or AU$6,600) and below $11,000 for the Dell 86 (£8,800 or AU$14,500).

SUBSCRIBE Google: $26 billion in Q4 revenue beats expectations but earnings down Total company revenues for 2016 were $90.3 billion vs. $75 billion in 2015. Greg Sterling on January 26, 2017 at 5:50 pm More Google parent Alphabet Inc. announced financial results for the fourth quarter of last year. The company reported $26.06 billion in quarterly revenue, which was more than financial analysts had expected. However, adjusted earnings per share of $9.36 were below expectations. Overall year-over-year revenue growth was 22 percent. Ad revenues were $22.4 billion, representing 17 percent growth. Despite these figures, the stock was down in after-hours trading. Paid clicks were up on Google sites and network properties, 43 percent and 7 percent respectively. But CPCs were down 16 percent and 19 percent. The company credited mobile search and video advertising with driving its top-line revenue growth. Google reported “other revenues” growth of 62 percent to $3.4 billion. This category includes some of the hardware products that the company has developed (e.g., Pixel, Google Home). Financial analysts estimate that Google may have sold one million Pixel phones during the holiday quarter. Sales for Google Home have been estimated at between 400,000 and 500,000 units. Alphabet has roughly $86 billion in cash and marketable securities. Total revenues for 2016 were $90.3 billion vs. $75 billion in 2015. Notes from the earnings call: Most of the analyst questions surrounded three areas: mobile/voice search, YouTube ads and non-ad YouTube revenue and expenses that were higher than expected. On voice search and related monetization, Sundar Pichai said, “We are really excited about [voice search]. We expect voice to work across many different contexts: phones, homes, TVs, cars. Google Home had a very strong quarter; we’re going to invest a lot in it in 2017.” In response to a question about Google’s search model and vulnerability to competition (read: Amazon), Pichai said, “The Google Assistant is an end-to-end thing. Users engage with us across devices throughout the day. I see more opportunity than challenge when I think of voice search.” On the Pixel opportunity, Pichai said, “It’s important for us to work at the intersection of hardware, software and services.” He said he didn’t think that Google’s release of the Pixel phone and potential successor efforts in the future would harm the broader Android ecosystem. On how AI may be impacting monetization across Google, Pichai says it’s definitely having a positive impact on revenues, although he cautioned that it’s early days.

Google, even without its Other Bets like Fiber, Nest, and Waymo (the self-driving car initiative), has managed to eke out more revenue than Microsoft for three consecutive quarters now. For the past few years Google has been closing in on Microsoft. Now it’s not just an aberration; it’s a trend. Above: See the change in the past three quarters? Image Credit: Jordan Novet/VentureBeat Microsoft and Google accumulate revenue in different ways. But they both do business in areas like document creation (Google Docs/Sheets/Slides vs. Microsoft Word/Excel PowerPoint), web search (Google vs. Bing), and even desktop operating systems (Windows vs. Chrome OS). Oh, and mobile operating systems (Windows vs. Android). And so on. As for Alphabet’s Other Bets, they are small in a financial sense — contributing just $262 million in revenue out of Alphabet’s total of $26.06 billion — but they are becoming a factor right as Google and its parent company pull ahead. Google announced the Alphabet switch-up way back in August 2015. Now Google just has to take on Apple, whose revenue in the third quarter was pretty much twice that of Alphabet.

Despite the spread of 401(k) retirement plans, the wealthiest 10 percent of households own roughly 80 percent of stock market wealth. The Dow's 23 percent surge over the past year has benefited mostly investors who were already well-off. The rising concentration of wealth at the top is one reason why the economy's significant gains since the Great Recession ended 7? years ago haven't been felt by many Americans. Though the Dow more than doubled in President Barack Obama's two terms, pay growth was stagnant, especially for people without higher education or high-tech skills. Discontent and anxiety about the economy's direction helped fuel President Donald Trump's election victory. ———— Slow fix: VW diesel owners complain of buyback delays DETROIT (AP) — Volkswagen's efforts to do right by owners who unknowingly purchased cars and SUVs that cheat on emissions tests have run into some speed bumps. Owners say the company isn't delivering on a promise to quickly buy back their vehicles. Some complain about multiple requests for paperwork, even after being told their application was complete. The German automaker acknowledges some hiccups, but blames delays on an overwhelming volume of buyback requests. A company lawyer told the judge handling the VW case that almost 400,000 owners had applied to have their vehicles repurchased in the three months since a legal settlement was approved. ——— Ford CEO hopeful that Trump will ease gas mileage standards DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) — Ford Motor Co.'s top executive is hopeful that President Donald Trump could ease government fuel economy requirements and reduce corporate taxes to help the auto industry grow and create jobs. The comments from Chief Executive Mark Fields came Thursday, two days after he and his counterparts at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and General Motors Co. met with Trump at the White House. Fields said on a conference call after Ford announced its 2016 earnings that they discussed emissions and gas mileage requirements that were finalized by the Environmental Protection Agency in the waning days of the Obama administration. "We may see some actions on that which could be positive for our business," Fields said. ——— US new-home sales tumble in December WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans pulled back sharply from buying new homes in December, but sales for all of 2016 were the highest since 2007. The Commerce Department said Thursday that new-home sales last month fell 10.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate 536,000. But sales totaled 563,000 in 2016, up 12.2 percent over the past year. Much of the sales growth during 2016 came from low mortgage rates and a steadily improving job market. But 2017 begins with some of that momentum possibly stalling as mortgage rates have risen since the November presidential election, worsening affordability and potentially curbing sales growth as more buyers cope with affordability issues. ——— J&J to spend $30 billion on Swiss drugmaker Actelion Johnson & Johnson will buy Swiss drugmaker Actelion in a $30 billion deal that both secures promising research and bolsters the product portfolio controlled by the U.S. health care giant. Much of Actelion's research operation will be spun off into a separate company in which J&J will own a minority stake. The U.S. conglomerate will then buy Actelion's seven drugs that are currently on the market and two potential treatments in late-stage testing. ——— Your cable company wants to be your phone company, too NEW YORK (AP) — Your TV provider may soon become your phone company. Which seems only fair, because your phone company also wants to be your TV provider. In the next few months, cable giant Comcast will start selling wireless service, just as AT&T and Verizon already do. Charter, the No. 2 cable company, also has a mobile plan. Meanwhile, the largest wireless carriers — AT&T and Verizon — have launched digital TV services. The wireless companies are also developing a faster, more reliable version of the mobile internet that could compete with cable's broadband. ——— Google's Pixel phone shines despite misgauging demand SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The Pixel phone, Google's answer to Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy, is off to a promising start — but might have done even better had Google managed consumer demand as smartly as the device's sleek design. Although Google hasn't released sales figures, industry researchers say the Pixel has been a hot item since its October debut was greeted with mostly glowing reviews and the biggest marketing blitz in Google's 18-year history. But there were missed opportunities. Google didn't have enough Pixels available to meet demand. Rather than wait several weeks, many consumers interested in the Pixel probably bought an iPhone, Galaxy or another phone instead. And these people aren't likely to need a phone replacement for another year or two. ——— Average US 30-year mortgage rate rises to 4.19 percent WASHINGTON (AP) — Long-term US mortgage rates rose this week after three weeks of declines, marking their first increase of the year. Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday the rate on 30-year fixed-rate loans climbed to an average 4.19 percent from 4.09 percent last week. That was still sharply higher than a 30-year rate that averaged 3.65 percent for all of 2016, the lowest level recorded from records going back to 1971. A year ago, the benchmark rate stood at 3.79 percent. The average for a 15-year mortgage increased to 3.40 percent from 3.34 percent last week. ——— The Dow Jones industrial average rose 32.40 points, or 0.2 percent, to 20,100.91. The S&P 500 index fell 1.69 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,296.68. The Nasdaq slid 1.16 points, or 0.02 percent, to 5,655.18. Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose $1.03, or 2 percent, to close at $53.78 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, gained $1.16, or 2.1 percent, to close at $56.24 a barrel in London. Wholesale gasoline rose 2 cents to $1.54 a gallon, while heating oil added 3 cents to $1.64 a gallon. Natural gas futures rose 5 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $3.38 per 1,000 cubic feet. 0 Shares Email Star Comments Business Highlights " Trump Orders Suspension of All Refugees, Immigrants From Some Muslim Nations " Trump Called National Park Service Upset Over Inauguration Crowd Retweet " Vice President Mike Pence Tells March for Life: 'Life Is Winning Again in America' " Seasonal Flu Reaches Epidemic Levels in US " Trump Says He'll Let Defense Secretary 'Override' Him on Torture After New Rape Lawsuit, Baylor Says Made 'Great Progress' " Trump, Mexico's President Speak by Phone " Putin Consults His Security Council Before Talking to Trump " Mumps Outbreak Worsens in Washington State " Army Veteran, Double-Amputee Finds New Battlefield in DC " Georgia Town Leaders Apologize for 1940 Lynching " In Iowa, Trump Voters Cheer Changes, Dismiss Petty Fights " Ivanka Trump's Son Crawls for First Time in White House " Holocaust Site Spurs Questions on Young Germans' Changing Views " How Trump's Memorandum Could Boost Military Readiness " Philadelphia Mayor: Trump's Remarks an 'Insult' to Police " New Trump Agency Memo Gags Staff Communications, Democrats Say " Little Girl Befriends Baby Cow Who Lost Its Mom " NASA Opens Exhibit on 50th Anniversary of Apollo 1 Fire " FBI Offers Up to $10K Reward for Information in Murder of ABC Chicago Producer in Belize " 'Hamilton' Actors to Sing 'America the Beautiful' at Super Bowl LI " Inside Taylor Swift's $25 Million Beverly Hills Mansion " 'Bear' the Dog Hoping to Find a New Forever Home

The company posted a stronger-than-expected 22.2 per cent increase in quarterly revenue as advertisers spent more to reach an expanding user base that spends more time on smartphones and YouTube. While advertising still accounts for the lion’s share of Google’s revenue, rising 17.4 per cent to $22.4 billion in the quarter, Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat underscored that the company is broadening its business — pointing to growth in hardware, app sales and the cloud business. The company’s other revenue, which captures such businesses, climbed 62 per cent to $3.4 billion. “We see tremendous potential ahead for these businesses, as well as in the continued development of non-advertising revenue streams for YouTube,” Porat said on a call with investors. The results were met with a mixed reaction from Wall Street, which sent shares down 2.2 per cent to $838 in extended trade after closing at $856.98 on Nasdaq. Google faced a higher tax rate of 22 per cent, compared to 19 percent for the year overall, contributing to the dent in profitability. “If you look above that, business as usual,” said analyst James Wang of ARK Investment Management.  “There has been no margin compression in the actual business.”  Executives suggested that they are beginning to reap the rewards of their investment in hardware. Porat spotlighted the company’s line of Nest smart home products, saying sales doubled during the key holiday period including Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Google-branded hardware also showed promise as Google Home, a smart speaker, and the Pixel smartphone gained traction over the holidays, Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said during the call. “We are committed to this for the long term as a great way to bring a beautiful, seamless Google experience to people,” he said. The company posted a stronger-than-expected 22.2 per cent increase in quarterly revenue as advertisers spent more to reach an expanding user base that spends more time on smartphones and YouTube. Research firm eMarketer has estimated that Google will capture $60.92 billion in search ad revenue this year, or 58.8 per cent of the search ad market worldwide. Paid clicks, or clicks on Google ads, rose 36 per cent, compared with a 33 per cent increase in the third quarter. Paid clicks are those ads on which an advertiser pays only if a user clicks on them. Analysts on average had expected a rise of 26.9 per cent, according to FactSet StreetAccount. Cost-per-click dropped 9 per cent, a slide that has continued as Google sells more mobile ads, which command lower prices. However, the shift is not necessarily alarming as it suggests Google is selling more ads on YouTube, which are seen as a key growth driver, Rice said. Alphabet’s Other Bets revenue increased to $262 million from $150 million a year earlier, while the operating loss of $1.09 billion narrowed from $1.21 billion. Other Bets includes broadband business Google Fiber, home automation products Nest, self-driving technology company Waymo as well as X, the company’s research facility that works on “moon shot” ventures. Verily Life Sciences, one such bet, announced Thursday that Singapore-based investment company Temasek had invested $800 million for a minority stake in the company. The investment reflects Alphabet’s greater fiscal discipline under Porat and suggests a potential new model for the other bets, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. “Getting external investors involved helps spread that risk out and reduces Google’s exposure,” he said. “It also allows some things to move faster than they would if it were just Google’s cash backing them.” Alphabet’s net income rose to $5.33 billion, or $7.56 per Class A and B share and Class C capital stock, in the fourth quarter, from $4.92 billion, or $7.06 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned $9.36 per share, below the average estimate of $9.64 per share, according to Thomson Reuters. The company’s consolidated revenue rose to $26.06 billion above the average estimate of $25.26 billion.

The company’s shares fell slightly in closed-market trading after it published fourth-quarter results as investors balked at an increase in spending. Alphabet reported a 22pc increase in quarterly revenue to $26.1bn (£20.8bn), which the company said was down to growing advertising income from mobile searches and its YouTube video service. Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, said the Christmas season had seen a big rise in mobile shopping compared to the previous year. Profits grew 8pc to $5.3bn, but missed forecasts. In October, Google released its first smartphone in an attempt to challenge Apple’s iPhone, as well as its Google Home smart speaker as part of a new push into hardware. Though Mr Pichai said he had been “thrilled” with the reception for the company’s new devices, Google has spent heavily on an advertising blitz to support them. Capital expenditure also rose by 46pc as the company invested heavily to challenge Microsoft and Amazon in the fast-growing market for cloud computing, in which businesses rent remote computing capacity from providers. Google restructured itself into the new Alphabet company in 2015, separating the core business of its search engine and Android operating system from other divisions such as its self-driving car project, its healthcare arm Verily and the DeepMind artificial intelligence division. Google is still the driver of Alphabet's profits Google’s co-founder Larry Page became chief executive of Alphabet under the new structure, with Mr Pichai put in charge of the day-to-day running of the internet business. Despite the changes, Google is by far Alphabet’s biggest money maker. It reported $25.8bn in revenue and an operating profit of $7.9bn in the quarter, while the remaining businesses known as “other bets” had revenues of just $262m and made a yawning $1.1bn loss, although this was slightly narrower than a year ago. Alphabet shares, which were trading at an all-time high, fell by around 3pc this evening. Microsoft also reported quarterly results tonight, posting a rise in sales and profit thanks to the growth of its cloud services. The Seattle-based company’s Azure cloud computing business and its Office 365 subscription service both grew strongly, while the slowing decline in PC sales also helped to support revenues. PC sales, from which Microsoft makes money by selling licences to Windows, have slumped in recent years, but the decline appeared to tail off last year. The company’s revenue grew 1pc to $24bn and profits were up 3.6pc to $5.2bn. Shares rose slightly in after-hours trading. The company’s market value recently surpassed $500bn.

Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google, reports earnings Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The Pixel phone, Google's answer to Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy, is off to a promising start — but might have done even better had Google managed consumer demand as smartly as the device's sleek design. Although Google hasn't released sales figures, industry researchers say the Pixel has been a hot item since its October debut was greeted with mostly glowing reviews and the biggest marketing blitz in Google's 18-year history. But there were missed opportunities. Google didn't have enough Pixels available to meet demand. Rather than wait several weeks, many consumers interested in the Pixel probably bought an iPhone, Galaxy or another phone instead. And these people aren't likely to need a phone replacement for another year or two. Google also struck a deal to sell it through just one wireless carrier, Verizon. Although Google's online store sold Pixels compatible with other wireless networks, most people don't shop for phones that way. Of course, it's a moot point if there weren't enough Pixels to sell, but Google likely would have produced more if it had distribution deals with other carriers. It's not surprising that Google misjudged the market, given that this is the search company's first stab at making its own phone. Previously, it partnered with various manufacturers on a Nexus line of phones to showcase its Android operating system, but that effort barely made a dent. "This was probably a really good learning experience for them," says Neil Doshi, an analyst with Mizhuo Securities USA. The Pixel's success is important to Google because it wants to ensure there's a stylish Android phone to compete with the iPhone and drive more affluent consumers to its search engine, maps, YouTube videos and other services. Samsung's Galaxy and other phones also run on Android, but those devices have been de-emphasizing Google's services. Google, which is based in Mountain View, California, can afford to make some mistakes as it tries to establish the Pixel because its internet search and advertising network brings in so much revenue. Alphabet, Google's corporate parent, provided another reminder of its financial might with Thursday's release of its fourth-quarter earnings. The company earned $5.3 billion on revenue of $26 billion during the final three months of last year. Even after subtracting commissions paid to Google's ad partners, Alphabet's revenue totaled $21 billion — a 23 percent increase from a year earlier. The company's profit rose 8 percent from the prior year. Although Pixel sales weren't disclosed, the numbers provided a clue on how the phone did. Google's "other revenue" segment, which covers all sales outside of advertising, generated $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter, a 62 percent increase from the same time last year. Some of those gains came from sales of Google's new internet-connected speaker, Home, and its business software services, but Doshi believes most of the increase was generated by the Pixel.

He estimates Google sold 1 million to 1.5 million Pixels during the fourth quarter. That's still just a sliver of the estimated 77 million that Apple sold during the same period (Apple is scheduled to release its numbers Tuesday). Pixel sales are also well below the roughly 15 million Galaxy S7 that Samsung sold during that device's first quarter on the market. Still, analysts say the Pixel did exceptionally well for a new phone with little brand recognition. "Without question, Google has a hit on its hands and is building a platform for success," says Jeff Moore, principal of Wave7 Research. Wave7 estimates that Pixel accounted for 12 percent of activations in December compared with 51 percent for iPhones and 26 percent for Samsung devices. Localytics, which tracks app activity on nearly 2 billion smartphones, also reported Pixel activations have steadily increased since sales began, especially around the Thanksgiving weekend and the holidays. "It looks like it has the potential to be a strong competitor to the likes of Apple and Samsung," says Josh Todd, Localytics' chief marketing officer.

Introduced earlier this month, a new feature on Google Maps aims to alleviate a bit of that stress. The app indicates how difficult it will be to find parking at your destination. “Historical parking data” calculates a parking difficulty score, according to Google. The score is then displayed in the app with notifications such as “limited,” “medium” or “easy,” based on documented parking space demand. But Google’s parking feature doesn’t seem to take into account current conditions. To implement the feature, set the destination and activate directions in the app. An icon indicating the parking demand will then be featured at the bottom of the screen. Google is experimenting with the new feature in 25 large cities, including San Francisco, Seattle, Miami and Denver.

Zeman   @phonescooper Google today added a tool to Google Maps that helps people gauge how difficult parking will be when they arrive at their destination. Google will rate parking difficulty across 25 metro regions in the U.S., including major cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Dallas, Denver, Orlando, Seattle, and Atlanta. Parking difficulty will be rated easy, medium, or limited. Google says it will use historical parking data to make these assessments for each location. The parking difficulty tool is only available within the turn-by-turn navigation feature of Google Maps for Android. The idea is to let people factor in the time it will take to find parking when planning trips. Google expects to make the new version of Maps available via the Google Play Store over the next few days. more info at Google » Related Google news Android news AD Comments Start a new discussion You must log in to post.

(Big Stock Photo / AVA55) It can be nearly impossible to find parking in Seattle, or any major city for that matter. But now, rather then heading out for a work meeting or dinner date only to find yourself circling the block a dozen times, you can check Google Maps before you leave. (Google Graphic) On Thursday, Google added a parking difficulty icon to Maps. The feature will appear in the directions section of the app and label street parking at your destination as either easy, medium or limited. Similar to Google’s algorithm that determines popular times of a business, the company will use historical parking data showing what parking looks like at certain times of the day. The feature — which is for Android right now — is currently available in 25 cities in the U.S., including Seattle, Portland, San Francisco and Los Angeles.

Google parent company Alphabet saw shares fall slightly after missing analyst expectations for its fourth quarter earnings report. Alphabet, the holding company that includes Google, posted $26 billion in revenue, beating the $25.2 billion Wall Street expected, and up 22 percent year-over-year. The company also posted adjusted profit of $9.36 per share; analysts expected $9.64. Shares were down 3 percent in after-hours trading; shares are up more than 14 percent in the past year. “Our growth in the fourth quarter was exceptional — with revenues up 22% year on year and 24% on a constant currency basis,” Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat said in a statement. “This performance was led by mobile search and YouTube. We’re seeing great momentum in Google’s newer investment areas and ongoing strong progress in Other Bets.” The Google business (search, ads, maps, apps, cloud, Play, YouTube, Android, virtual reality, etc.) was responsible for $25.8 billion in operating income this past quarter (up from $21.2 billion last year) and $7.9 billion in profits (up from $6.7 billion last year). Alphabet’s category called “Other Bets” — which includes more risky projects like Google X, Calico, Life Sciences, and more — posted revenue of $262 million on an operating loss of $1.1 billion. That’s up from revenue of $150 million on an operating loss of $1.2 billion a year ago. Advertising is still Alphabet’s cash cow. Total advertising revenue was up 17 percent to $22.4 billion. Aggregate cost-per-click fell 15 percent, but aggregate paid clicks were up 36 percent from the year-ago quarter. Alphabet added 2,100 employees during Q2 and now employs 72,053 people, up from 61,814 one year ago. Alphabet ended 2016 with $86.3 billion in cash, up from $73 billion a year ago. It’s been a busy quarter for Google’s hardware team, as the company rolled out its voice assistant Google Home, Pixel smartphone, and Daydream View VR headset. Google didn’t break out hardware sales data in its earnings, however, the company’s “other revenues,” which do not include advertising, were up 62 percent year-over-year.

It's supposed to feature waterproofing with a "decent water and dust resistance rating", the report said. The upcoming flagship will also have a much improved camera, as Google seems to be really focusing on that spec, trying to master low light photography. Keep in mind Google heavily marketed the first Pixel's low-light capabilities, and generally has been well received. Although the phone's camera will "not have large MP size," it will "compensate in extra features". Other leaked details includes a note that Google is making a few prototypes, including a budget "Pixel 2B" version that's being tested with different chipsets - "some with Snapdragon 83X chips, others with Intel chips" or even a Google-developed "custom chipset" - and less powerful hardware. Pixel 2B would also be significantly cheaper than the Pixel 2, and it could launch at the same time or shortly after Pixel 2, which is getting a $50 price hike. The two versions would be aimed at different markets. The Pixel 2B, for instance, appears geared toward emerging markets. Check out Pocket-lint's round-up of Pixel 2 features we'd like to see.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 6:20 AM, January 27, 2017 Updated: 10:10 AM, January 27, 2017 Google parent Alphabet Inc posted fourth-quarter profit below analysts' estimates on Thursday, hurt by a higher tax rate, but analysts cheered the company's progress in diversifying its business beyond advertising. While advertising still accounts for the lion's share of Google's revenue, rising 17.4 percent to $22.4 billion in the quarter, Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat underscored that the company is broadening its business - pointing to growth in hardware, app sales and the cloud business. The company's other revenue, which captures such businesses, climbed 62 percent to $3.4 billion. "We see tremendous potential ahead for these businesses, as well as in the continued development of non-advertising revenue streams for YouTube," Porat said on a call with investors. The results were met with a mixed reaction from Wall Street, which sent shares down 2.2 percent to $838 in extended trade after closing at $856.98 on Nasdaq. Google faced a higher tax rate of 22 percent, compared to 19 percent for the year overall, contributing to the dent in profitability. "If you look above that, it’s business as usual," said analyst James Wang of ARK Investment Management. "There has been no margin compression in the actual business." Executives suggested that they are beginning to reap the rewards of their investment in hardware. Porat spotlighted the company's line of Nest smart home products, saying sales doubled during the key holiday period including Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Google-branded hardware also showed promise as Google Home, a smart speaker, and the Pixel smartphone gained traction over the holidays, Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said during the call. "We’re committed to this for the long term as a great way to bring a beautiful, seamless Google experience to people," he said. The company posted a stronger-than-expected 22.2 percent increase in quarterly revenue as advertisers spent more to reach an expanding user base that spends more time on smartphones and YouTube. Research firm eMarketer has estimated that Google will capture $60.92 billion in search ad revenue this year, or 58.8 percent of the search ad market worldwide. Paid clicks, or clicks on Google ads, rose 36 percent, compared with a 33 percent increase in the third quarter. Paid clicks are those ads on which an advertiser pays only if a user clicks on them. Analysts on average had expected a rise of 26.9 percent, according to FactSet StreetAccount. Cost-per-click dropped 9 percent, a slide that has continued as Google sells more mobile ads, which command lower prices. However, the shift is not necessarily alarming as it suggests Google is selling more ads on YouTube, which are seen as a key growth driver, Rice said. Alphabet's Other Bets revenue increased to $262 million from $150 million a year earlier, while the operating loss of $1.09 billion narrowed from $1.21 billion. Other Bets includes broadband business Google Fiber, home automation products Nest, self-driving technology company Waymo as well as X, the company's research facility that works on "moon shot" ventures. Verily Life Sciences, one such bet, announced Thursday that Singapore-based investment company Temasek had invested $800 million for a minority stake in the company. The investment reflects Alphabet's greater fiscal discipline under Porat and suggests a potential new model for the other bets, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. "Getting external investors involved helps spread that risk out and reduces Google’s exposure," he said. "It also allows some things to move faster than they would if it were just Google's cash backing them." Alphabet's net income rose to $5.33 billion, or $7.56 per Class A and B share and Class C capital stock, in the fourth quarter, from $4.92 billion, or $7.06 per share, a year earlier. See graphic on earnings: (http://bit.ly/2kyl4fS) Excluding items, the company earned $9.36 per share, below the average estimate of $9.64 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company's consolidated revenue rose to $26.06 billion above the average estimate of $25.26 billion.

Close share panel Image copyright Getty Images Google parent Alphabet's latest profit figures have missed forecasts, sending the tech giant's shares falling in extended trading on Wall Street. Profits rose 8% to $5.3bn (£4.2bn) for the last three months of 2016, fuelled by more advertising on mobile phones and YouTube. But analysts had expected more, and Alphabet's shares fell almost 3% . However, revenue for the quarter topped $26bn, up 22% from the same period the year before. Google's advertising revenue, which accounts for the bulk of its business, rose 17.4% to $22.40bn in the quarter. Paid clicks, or clicks on Google ads, rose 36%, compared with a 33% increase in the third quarter. Paid clicks are those ads on which an advertiser pays only if a user clicks on them. "Our growth in the fourth quarter was exceptional," Alphabet chief financial officer Ruth Porat said in a statement. "We're seeing great momentum in Google's newer investment areas and ongoing strong progress in Other Bets." 'Tremendous potential' For earnings purposes, Alphabet separates operations such as self-driving cars and broadband into its Other Bets category, which nearly doubled revenue to $262m in the quarter but still posted a loss of nearly $1.1bn. Under its new structure, Alphabet is seeking to expand beyond its role as a search engine and develop new revenues streams. Ms Porat pointed to growth app sales, hardware and the cloud business. "We see tremendous potential ahead for these businesses, as well as in the continued development of non-advertising revenue streams for YouTube," she said.

Despite the spread of 401(k) retirement plans, the wealthiest 10 percent of households own roughly 80 percent of stock market wealth. The Dow's 23 percent surge over the past year has benefited mostly investors who were already well-off. The rising concentration of wealth at the top is one reason why the economy's significant gains since the Great Recession ended 7 years ago haven't been felt by many Americans. Though the Dow more than doubled in President Barack Obama's two terms, pay growth was stagnant, especially for people without higher education or high-tech skills. Discontent and anxiety about the economy's direction helped fuel President Donald Trump's election victory. ____ Slow fix: VW diesel owners complain of buyback delays DETROIT (AP) " Volkswagen's efforts to do right by owners who unknowingly purchased cars and SUVs that cheat on emissions tests have run into some speed bumps. Owners say the company isn't delivering on a promise to quickly buy back their vehicles. Some complain about multiple requests for paperwork, even after being told their application was complete. The German automaker acknowledges some hiccups, but blames delays on an overwhelming volume of buyback requests. A company lawyer told the judge handling the VW case that almost 400,000 owners had applied to have their vehicles repurchased in the three months since a legal settlement was approved. ___ Ford CEO hopeful that Trump will ease gas mileage standards Continued below. Related Content Rodney Hide: Waitangi Day a shemozzle Your views: Readers' letters Small businesses upbeat about year ahead DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) " Ford Motor Co.'s top executive is hopeful that President Donald Trump could ease government fuel economy requirements and reduce corporate taxes to help the auto industry grow and create jobs. The comments from Chief Executive Mark Fields came Thursday, two days after he and his counterparts at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and General Motors Co. met with Trump at the White House. Fields said on a conference call after Ford announced its 2016 earnings that they discussed emissions and gas mileage requirements that were finalized by the Environmental Protection Agency in the waning days of the Obama administration. "We may see some actions on that which could be positive for our business," Fields said. ___ US new-home sales tumble in December WASHINGTON (AP) " Americans pulled back sharply from buying new homes in December, but sales for all of 2016 were the highest since 2007. The Commerce Department said Thursday that new-home sales last month fell 10.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate 536,000. But sales totaled 563,000 in 2016, up 12.2 percent over the past year. Much of the sales growth during 2016 came from low mortgage rates and a steadily improving job market. But 2017 begins with some of that momentum possibly stalling as mortgage rates have risen since the November presidential election, worsening affordability and potentially curbing sales growth as more buyers cope with affordability issues. ___ J&J to spend $30 billion on Swiss drugmaker Actelion Johnson & Johnson will buy Swiss drugmaker Actelion in a $30 billion deal that both secures promising research and bolsters the product portfolio controlled by the U.S. health care giant. Much of Actelion's research operation will be spun off into a separate company in which J&J will own a minority stake. The U.S. conglomerate will then buy Actelion's seven drugs that are currently on the market and two potential treatments in late-stage testing. ___ Your cable company wants to be your phone company, too NEW YORK (AP) " Your TV provider may soon become your phone company. Which seems only fair, because your phone company also wants to be your TV provider. In the next few months, cable giant Comcast will start selling wireless service, just as AT&T and Verizon already do. Charter, the No. 2 cable company, also has a mobile plan. Meanwhile, the largest wireless carriers " AT&T and Verizon " have launched digital TV services. The wireless companies are also developing a faster, more reliable version of the mobile internet that could compete with cable's broadband. ___ Google's Pixel phone shines despite misgauging demand SAN FRANCISCO (AP) " The Pixel phone, Google's answer to Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy, is off to a promising start " but might have done even better had Google managed consumer demand as smartly as the device's sleek design. Although Google hasn't released sales figures, industry researchers say the Pixel has been a hot item since its October debut was greeted with mostly glowing reviews and the biggest marketing blitz in Google's 18-year history. But there were missed opportunities. Google didn't have enough Pixels available to meet demand. Rather than wait several weeks, many consumers interested in the Pixel probably bought an iPhone, Galaxy or another phone instead. And these people aren't likely to need a phone replacement for another year or two. ___ Average US 30-year mortgage rate rises to 4.19 percent WASHINGTON (AP) " Long-term US mortgage rates rose this week after three weeks of declines, marking their first increase of the year. Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday the rate on 30-year fixed-rate loans climbed to an average 4.19 percent from 4.09 percent last week. That was still sharply higher than a 30-year rate that averaged 3.65 percent for all of 2016, the lowest level recorded from records going back to 1971. A year ago, the benchmark rate stood at 3.79 percent. The average for a 15-year mortgage increased to 3.40 percent from 3.34 percent last week. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average rose 32.40 points, or 0.2 percent, to 20,100.91. The S&P 500 index fell 1.69 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,296.68. The Nasdaq slid 1.16 points, or 0.02 percent, to 5,655.18. Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose $1.03, or 2 percent, to close at $53.78 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, gained $1.16, or 2.1 percent, to close at $56.24 a barrel in London. Wholesale gasoline rose 2 cents to $1.54 a gallon, while heating oil added 3 cents to $1.64 a gallon. Natural gas futures rose 5 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $3.38 per 1,000 cubic feet.

The Associated Press Published Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017 5:34PM EST Last updated Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017 5:34PM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print ___ For most Americans, Dow 20,000 carries little benefit WASHINGTON (AP) — While Wall Street celebrates yet another stock market record — surpassing 20,000 on the Dow Jones industrial average — many Americans have little reason to cheer. Despite the spread of 401(k) retirement plans, the wealthiest 10 per cent of households own roughly 80 per cent of stock market wealth. The Dow's 23 per cent surge over the past year has benefited mostly investors who were already well-off. The rising concentration of wealth at the top is one reason why the economy's significant gains since the Great Recession ended 7 1/2 years ago haven't been felt by many Americans. Though the Dow more than doubled in President Barack Obama's two terms, pay growth was stagnant, especially for people without higher education or high-tech skills. Discontent and anxiety about the economy's direction helped fuel President Donald Trump's election victory. ____ Slow fix: VW diesel owners complain of buyback delays DETROIT (AP) — Volkswagen's efforts to do right by owners who unknowingly purchased cars and SUVs that cheat on emissions tests have run into some speed bumps. Owners say the company isn't delivering on a promise to quickly buy back their vehicles. Some complain about multiple requests for paperwork, even after being told their application was complete. The German automaker acknowledges some hiccups, but blames delays on an overwhelming volume of buyback requests. A company lawyer told the judge handling the VW case that almost 400,000 owners had applied to have their vehicles repurchased in the three months since a legal settlement was approved. ___ Ford CEO hopeful that Trump will ease gas mileage standards DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) — Ford Motor Co.'s top executive is hopeful that President Donald Trump could ease government fuel economy requirements and reduce corporate taxes to help the auto industry grow and create jobs. The comments from Chief Executive Mark Fields came Thursday, two days after he and his counterparts at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and General Motors Co. met with Trump at the White House. Fields said on a conference call after Ford announced its 2016 earnings that they discussed emissions and gas mileage requirements that were finalized by the Environmental Protection Agency in the waning days of the Obama administration. "We may see some actions on that which could be positive for our business," Fields said. ___ US new-home sales tumble in December WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans pulled back sharply from buying new homes in December, but sales for all of 2016 were the highest since 2007. The Commerce Department said Thursday that new-home sales last month fell 10.4 per cent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate 536,000. But sales totalled 563,000 in 2016, up 12.2 per cent over the past year. Much of the sales growth during 2016 came from low mortgage rates and a steadily improving job market. But 2017 begins with some of that momentum possibly stalling as mortgage rates have risen since the November presidential election, worsening affordability and potentially curbing sales growth as more buyers cope with affordability issues. ___ J&J to spend $30 billion on Swiss drugmaker Actelion Johnson & Johnson will buy Swiss drugmaker Actelion in a $30 billion deal that both secures promising research and bolsters the product portfolio controlled by the U.S. health care giant. Much of Actelion's research operation will be spun off into a separate company in which J&J will own a minority stake. The U.S. conglomerate will then buy Actelion's seven drugs that are currently on the market and two potential treatments in late-stage testing. ___ Your cable company wants to be your phone company, too NEW YORK (AP) — Your TV provider may soon become your phone company. Which seems only fair, because your phone company also wants to be your TV provider. In the next few months, cable giant Comcast will start selling wireless service, just as AT&T and Verizon already do. Charter, the No. 2 cable company, also has a mobile plan. Meanwhile, the largest wireless carriers — AT&T and Verizon — have launched digital TV services. The wireless companies are also developing a faster, more reliable version of the mobile internet that could compete with cable's broadband. ___ Google's Pixel phone shines despite misgauging demand SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The Pixel phone, Google's answer to Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy, is off to a promising start — but might have done even better had Google managed consumer demand as smartly as the device's sleek design. Although Google hasn't released sales figures, industry researchers say the Pixel has been a hot item since its October debut was greeted with mostly glowing reviews and the biggest marketing blitz in Google's 18-year history. But there were missed opportunities. Google didn't have enough Pixels available to meet demand. Rather than wait several weeks, many consumers interested in the Pixel probably bought an iPhone, Galaxy or another phone instead. And these people aren't likely to need a phone replacement for another year or two. ___ Average US 30-year mortgage rate rises to 4.19 per cent WASHINGTON (AP) — Long-term US mortgage rates rose this week after three weeks of declines, marking their first increase of the year. Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday the rate on 30-year fixed-rate loans climbed to an average 4.19 per cent from 4.09 per cent last week. That was still sharply higher than a 30-year rate that averaged 3.65 per cent for all of 2016, the lowest level recorded from records going back to 1971. A year ago, the benchmark rate stood at 3.79 per cent. The average for a 15-year mortgage increased to 3.40 per cent from 3.34 per cent last week. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average rose 32.40 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 20,100.91. The S&P 500 index fell 1.69 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 2,296.68. The Nasdaq slid 1.16 points, or 0.02 per cent, to 5,655.18. Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose $1.03, or 2 per cent, to close at $53.78 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, gained $1.16, or 2.1 per cent, to close at $56.24 a barrel in London. Wholesale gasoline rose 2 cents to $1.54 a gallon, while heating oil added 3 cents to $1.64 a gallon. Natural gas futures rose 5 cents, or 1.5 per cent, to $3.38 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Alphabet had a massive quarter—but Wall Street is still not sold on its future Written by Mike Murphy January 26, 2017 What else is there? (AP/Kim Jin-a/Newsis) Share Written by Mike Murphy January 26, 2017 The broth in Alphabet’s soup is still pretty much Google. Alphabet announced its fourth-quarter earnings today. Wall Street had been expecting the company to post revenue of around $25 billion (up from $17 billion in the fourth quarter of 2015). Alphabet in fact generated more than $26 billion, up 22% over the same quarter last year. “Our growth in the fourth quarter was exceptional,” chief financial officer Ruth Porat said in a release. “This performance was led by mobile search and YouTube.” The overwhelming majority of that revenue—nearly 99%—came from Google. “Other Bets,” Alphabet’s catchall term for the companies and projects it’s exploring to diversify its revenue streams beyond search and advertising, lost roughly $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter. It seems beating analysts’ revenue expectations wasn’t enough for Wall Street though: Alphabet’s stock price was trading down roughly 2.5% (about $20) in after-hours trading. It’s likely that a small miss in earnings-per-share ($9.36, excluding some expenses, versus $9.61 expected) caused some of the market’s consternation, as did the fact that Alphabet doesn’t seem to be reeling in those “Other Bets” losses. Google is still generating lots of money Wall Street ambivalence aside, Google is still finding ways to increase its revenue. Google revenue for the quarter was nearly $26 billion—up 22% over the same quarter last year—and it brought in $7.8 billion in profit, up roughly 17%. “2016 was a great year for Google, and 2017 is shaping up to be even better,” Google CEO Sundar Pichai said on the company’s earnings call. That discrepancy between growth in quarterly revenue and quarterly profit, however, may give investors reason to be concerned about the long-term growth prospects of a company that has been so focused on search and advertising. Hardware is hard In October, Google launch a slate of self-branded products, arguably in an attempt to keep users locked into its ubiquitous software ecosystem, much as Apple does. The company released a new line of Pixel smartphones, a voice-activated smart speaker called Home, a virtual reality headset, wifi routers, and a new Chromecast streaming device. But it seems that these devices have not sold in quantities great enough to be noteworthy in Porat’s statement. Google did, however, report a 62% increase in non-advertising revenue over the same quarter in 2015. That roughly $1 billion increase was partially a result of an increase in hardware sales. And this could just be the beginning of Google’s hardware ambitions. Apple rakes in billions of dollars each quarter on iPhone sales alone, and did not report sales figures for many quarters after the initial launch of the iPhone 10 years ago. It remains to be seen whether anyone will want to switch to a Google-branded phone (in the US, initially, these phones were only available through Verizon), and whether Google’s smart-hub offering can differentiate itself enough from the early leader in the space, the Amazon Echo. What comes after search On Alphabet’s earnings call, Porat said sales in programmatic and YouTube advertising helped drive Google’s revenue growth in the quarter, and that cloud services constituted a “priority area” for Google’s hiring in 2017. Additionally, she said that Google’s non-advertising revenue growth was promising, and primarily driven by a mixture of hardware sales, media and app sales through the Google Play store, and cloud services, a business line in which the company is investing. “We see tremendous potential in these businesses,” Porat said, adding that Google is also investing in machine learning and “next-generation” computing systems. “Our cloud business is on a terrific upswing,” Pichai added. For all the growth in non-advertising revenue, however, 87% of Google’s revenue is still from advertising sales—although this is down from about 90% in the same quarter last year. Other Bets are still just bets Although Alphabet has grand designs on changing the world with self-driving cars, cures for disease, internet balloons, and all sorts of other fantastical projects, for now those ambitions are mostly money pits. A few Other Bets companies have put products on the market—smart-home-technology company Nest and broadband internet provider Fiber—but neither has driven noticeable revenue. In fact, Fiber has “paused operations” and Nest had a tumultuous 2016, with multiple top executives leaving the company. Other Bets did at least reduce its losses over the same quarter a year ago—$1.24 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016, versus $1.08 billion in 2015. Porat added on the call that for the full year, Other Bets generated $809 million in revenue, led by Nest, Fiber, and Verily, its life-sciences division. But the division lost $3.6 billion over the same period.

This is a 22 percent increase year over year. It’s important to note that when adjusted for payments for online traffic from distribution partners, fourth quarter revenue amounts to $21.2 billion. Overall, Google recorded revenues of $90.2 billion USD for the whole fiscal year. While Google’s search segment still represents the vast majority of the company’s revenue at $25.8 billion, the Other Bets division (responsible for everything outside of Google and YouTube) is slowly but surely gaining traction with $262 million in recorded revenue this past quarter. That’s up from $150 million at the same time last year. Its losses are also decreasing. In the 2015 fourth quarter results, Google revealed it lost $1.2 billion on the ‘moon shots’ division. In this year’s results, it lost only $1.08 billion. This can be partly attributed to Google spinning out its driverless car division project into a standalone company — Waymo.

Well, all that changes today, with a new update for the Android version of Google Maps. Initially rolling out in 25 major US cities, the app will warn you when parking near your destination may be limited, but it’ll also say when it’s likely to be easy. Related: Google Pixel 2: Five Features it must have While this is little help in actually finding a place to dump your car, the warning could encourage drivers to leave a little earlier than planned. In a post on its official blog, Google explains: “To see how hard it might be to park where you’re headed, just get directions to your destination and look for the parking difficulty icon in the directions card at the bottom of the screen. “Parking difficulties range from limited to medium to easy and are based on historical parking data (similar to how we calculate Popular Times and Visit Duration).” Here are the major US cities currently covered by the parking tool: San Francisco, Seattle, Miami, Atlanta, Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, Minneapolis/St. Paul, New York City, Orlando, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, San Diego, St. Louis, Tampa, the DC area, Cleveland, Dallas/Fort Worth, Denver, Houston, Phoenix, Portland and Sacramento. No news yet on when the feature might spread beyond the US. Is Google Maps still your navigation app of choice?

Roston - Jan 26, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Google has made it easier than ever to read Japanese: all you need is a phone. Using the Google Translate app’s camera feature, users can point their phone at a bit of Japanese text and see it on their screen in real-time, only with English where the Japanese text previously existed. In that way, it functions essentially as an augmented reality translation app, marking another step toward breaking down the language barrier. Google calls this Translate feature ‘Word Lens,’ and says the Japanese real-time translation support is now available to Android and iOS users. This joins the app’s previous (and still existing) ability to translate written Japanese text by taking a snapshot of it. As the video above shows, you don’t need to take a photo for this Word Lens feature — instead, just hold the camera in front of it as if you’re recording a video. Look at the text through your phone screen rather than directly. Read the Japanese text in your own language. It’s about as close to magic as you can get. Google lists the feature as being able to translate Japanese into English and English into Japanese. It isn’t clear when other languages will also be available for this Word Lens translation tool. To use the feature, you’ll need to download the Google Translate app for iOS or Android.

Alphabet’s bets beyond search are starting to pay off Posted yesterday by Matthew Lynley (@mattlynley) 0 SHARES Next Story Existing Nvidia Shield TV owners can now update to get 4K HDR streaming Google reported mixed earnings for its fourth quarter today — but we’re starting to see some flashes of improvement in its “other bets” category, which is where it stuffs pretty much everything that lives outside of Google proper. In the fourth quarter, Alphabet’s other bets recorded $262 million in revenue, a healthy jump from $150 million in the fourth quarter a year ago. But more importantly, the company’s losses in the division shrank from the previous year, from $1.2 billion in Q4 2015 to around $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter this year. Google’s other bets consists of products like Nest, and while this represents a tiny fraction of Google’s overall business, it’s important because it represents a lot of the market Google envisions itself occupying in the years to come — and it’s equally important to see strong performance in that category. CFO Ruth Porat dove into further into the other bets category for the full year, where other bets generated $809 million in 2016, up 82% vs 2015 — which was primarily generated by Nest, Fiber and Verily. The operating loss for the division was $2.9B for the first year 2016, a slight decline from 2015 (Porat didn’t specify there). So even if it’s a slight decline, it looks like things aren’t getting quite out of hand and losses are accelerating as Alphabet enters 2017. Alphabet will “continue to calibrate the magnitude and pace” of its investments in other bets, and “exercise careful stewardship over the amounts and pace of investments,” Porat said. Alphabet’s other bets in 2016 in particular faced scrutiny. The company sought to trim down a lot of the underperforming segments of Alphabet in order and focus its resources on the operations that were working. Alphabet has for a long time (with Google X) been known as a bit of a playground for new ideas — like balloons and fiber internet — but the company is showing signs that it needs to push forward into areas that it knows best and where it can dominate. That’s included making some aggressive moves like spinning out its self-driving car unit into a new company called Waymo, among others. If you wanted some perspective on how tiny this component is, here you go (but remember this is a significant area of importance for the company): FindTheCompany | Graphiq We’ve also seen Google expand into newer areas like trying to expand its Google Cloud, with moves like the hiring of Diane Green. It became clear that this could be a hugely lucrative business in 2016 by just looking at the performance of Amazon’s AWS business over the past year. That business has quickly become one of Amazon’s most efficient operations and contributing segments to its profitability, something which has surely not gone unnoticed with Google. Microsoft is also working to aggressively snap up as much of this space as it can, so there is plenty of competition. Here’s a point of performance for Google’s areas that include Play, Cloud and Hardware: Google’s “other revenues” which encompass that was up 62% to $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter, up from $2.1 billion in the same quarter a year earlier. There weren’t specific break-outs for those individual divisions, but it looks like either all are growing in a healthy clip or at there is some outsized performance in one or more. Analysts were looking for earnings of $9.67 per share on $25.22 billion in revenue. The company reported earnings of $9.36 per share on revenue of $26.06 billion. Given the mixed results, the stock was largely unchanged, but we’re starting to see some interesting developments for Google beyond search. Alphabet’s shares in extended trading fell around 2.5% — which, for a massive company for Google, is quite a bit — meaning there may be some uncertainty among Wall Street that Google is steering in the right direction as that ad value continues to fall. That it didn’t generate the earnings that Wall Street was expecting probably represents some concern that it’ll continue to be a cash machine while it figures out what happens throughout the next few years. Last year was essentially a transition year for Alphabet, which over the course of 2016 showed flashes of its transition beyond simply a search engine advertising business. While search has always been Google’s core competency — and decades of that have helped it build a powerful AI ecosystem — it’s not like it can continue monetizing with desktop search ads forever. The biggest result of this major shift away from desktop search is Google’s perpetually declining advertising value. The play for mobile has largely been to either figure out new advertising formats, or figure out how to generate more value from the much larger amount of impressions mobile devices generate. As a result, Google is able to offset its declining value per ad (the cost-per-click) with more impressions and still generate impressive results that keep Wall Street happy for now. Not surprisingly, we’re still seeing that in decline. Google’s cost-per-click once again fell, this time down 15% in the fourth quarter from the same quarter a year earlier. Its paid clicks, as expected, continued to rise and were up 36% in the fourth quarter from the same quarter a year earlier. So, on the advertising front, more or less the same story as the past previous quarters. Related Articles HTC's head VR designer joins Google as industrial design director IBM adds support for Google's Tensorflow to its PowerAI machine learning framework Google Maps will now tell you how bad the parking is at your destination Google Translate now provides live translation of Japanese text We’ve seen that with the likes of Google’s extension into a voice-based user interface. Google launched Google Assistant in the hopes that people would simply talk to their phones (and eventually find a way to monetize that). And then it quickly followed Amazon into created a living room-based speaker that its users can talk to for simple tasks like queries and streaming music. All of this helps Google get its users more accustomed to “asking” Google for answers and actions in a more conversational way, where it finds itself quickly diving into a massive competition with Amazon and Apple’s Siri. Conversational user interfaces seem like they may have snuck up on us, but it over time became very clear to Google that it couldn’t just be a box where users could type in keywords with results that it could advertise against.   Google’s pitch to Wall Street over the past year or so seems to have been good enough. So far, its advertising business is good enough — and continuing to grow as mobile devices continue to proliferate — while it figures out what comes next with its voice-enabled interface and also future platforms like VR. FindTheCompany | Graphiq Alphabet, for its part, has a huge window in 2017 to reclaim its crown as the most valuable company in the world — something it’s held for a brief moment over Apple. Apple’s growth strategy came to a halt in 2016. While it’s signaled it’ll return to growth on the strength of the iPhone 7 and other products in the first quarter this year, it’s opened a massive hole for a company to come in and scoop up potential new users in new avenues — like a voice-based UI — that Apple hasn’t captured just yet.

REUTERS/Regis Duvignau By Julia Love and Anya George Tharakan Google parent Alphabet Inc posted fourth-quarter profit below analysts' estimates on Thursday, hurt by a higher tax rate, but analysts cheered the company's progress in diversifying its business beyond advertising. While advertising still accounts for the lion's share of Google's revenue, rising 17.4 percent to $22.4 billion in the quarter, Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat underscored that the company is broadening its business - pointing to growth in hardware, app sales and the cloud business. The company's other revenue, which captures such businesses, climbed 62 percent to $3.4 billion. "We see tremendous potential ahead for these businesses, as well as in the continued development of non-advertising revenue streams for YouTube," Porat said on a call with investors. The results were met with a mixed reaction from Wall Street, which sent shares down 2.2 percent to $838 in extended trade after closing at $856.98 on Nasdaq. Google faced a higher tax rate of 22 percent, compared to 19 percent for the year overall, contributing to the dent in profitability. "If you look above that, it’s business as usual," said analyst James Wang of ARK Investment Management. "There has been no margin compression in the actual business." Executives suggested that they are beginning to reap the rewards of their investment in hardware. Porat spotlighted the company's line of Nest smart home products, saying sales doubled during the key holiday period including Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Google-branded hardware also showed promise as Google Home, a smart speaker, and the Pixel smartphone gained traction over the holidays, Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said during the call. "We’re committed to this for the long term as a great way to bring a beautiful, seamless Google experience to people," he said. The company posted a stronger-than-expected 22.2 percent increase in quarterly revenue as advertisers spent more to reach an expanding user base that spends more time on smartphones and YouTube. Research firm eMarketer has estimated that Google will capture $60.92 billion in search ad revenue this year, or 58.8 percent of the search ad market worldwide. Paid clicks, or clicks on Google ads, rose 36 percent, compared with a 33 percent increase in the third quarter. Paid clicks are those ads on which an advertiser pays only if a user clicks on them. Analysts on average had expected a rise of 26.9 percent, according to FactSet StreetAccount. Cost-per-click dropped 9 percent, a slide that has continued as Google sells more mobile ads, which command lower prices. However, the shift is not necessarily alarming as it suggests Google is selling more ads on YouTube, which are seen as a key growth driver, Rice said. Alphabet's Other Bets revenue increased to $262 million from $150 million a year earlier, while the operating loss of $1.09 billion narrowed from $1.21 billion. Other Bets includes broadband business Google Fiber, home automation products Nest, self-driving technology company Waymo as well as X, the company's research facility that works on "moon shot" ventures. Verily Life Sciences, one such bet, announced Thursday that Singapore-based investment company Temasek had invested $800 million for a minority stake in the company. The investment reflects Alphabet's greater fiscal discipline under Porat and suggests a potential new model for the other bets, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. "Getting external investors involved helps spread that risk out and reduces Google’s exposure," he said. "It also allows some things to move faster than they would if it were just Google's cash backing them." Alphabet's net income rose to $5.33 billion, or $7.56 per Class A and B share and Class C capital stock, in the fourth quarter, from $4.92 billion, or $7.06 per share, a year earlier.

Revenues rose 22 percent year-on-year to USD 26.064 billion, led by growth in mobile search and YouTube, according to Google CFO Ruth Porat in a statement. Net profit improved to USD 5.333 billion or USD 7.56 per share from USD 4.923 billion or USD 7.06 per share a year ago.  Google contributed USD 25.082 billion in revenue, up 18 percent from a year earlier, and operating profit of USD 7.883 billion, up 16.1 percent. The other bets had revenue of just USD 262 million, while their operating loss narrowed to USD 1.088 billion from USD 1.213 billion in Q4 2015.  Google's advertising revenues rose 17 percent to USD 22.399 billion, led by the growing mobile market, and other Google revenues were up an even stronger 62 percent to USD 3.403 billion. Traffic acquisition costs rose slightly to 22 percent of ad revenue from 21 percent a year ago.  Google reported a nearly 50 percent increase in capital expenditure to over USD 3 billion in the quarter, but free cash flow was still up 40.6 percent to USD 6.335 billion. The company ended the year with total cash of USD 86.333 billion, up from USD 73.066 billion a year earlier. Its headcount rose by over 10,000 in the past year to just over 72,000 employees at the end of 2016.  Free Headlines in your E-mail Every day we send out a free e-mail with the most important headlines of the last 24 hours.

The company is chasing makers with open-source tools needed to add artificial intelligence to consumer, industrial, and retail devices made using board computers. The plan may include machine-learning tools, which are central to AI. AI helps Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, and Microsoft's Cortana answer questions, and also helps self-driving cars cruise the streets safely. "We don't have any specifics to announce right now, but we're excited to keep sharing open-source machine learning tools with the community -- stay tuned for more this year," a Google spokesman said in an email. Earlier this week, Google published a market research survey in an effort to get a better grip on the maker community and its priorities. In the survey, Google hinted it was bringing "smart tools" to makers. In a blog entry, Raspberry Pi said those machine-learning tools will come later this year and will make smart devices even more powerful. Devices could get Google AI technologies like image and speech recognition. For example, a home-brewed robot or drone may be able to better recognize objects with Google's tools, or be able to respond to queries. Google provides APIs (application programming interfaces) so the services can be tweaked in gadgets. Google's voice recognition is the company's most visible AI technology. The Google Assistant is used in smartphones, tablets, TVs, and appliances like Google Home. But the technology hasn't been fully explored in smart devices made using board computers like Raspberry Pi 3. Providing a helping hand to makers could provide Google one more avenue to grow in the emerging internet-of-things market. According to analyst firm IHS, shipments of IoT devices will reach 30.7 billion by 2020 and 75.4 billion by 2025, outstripping smartphones and PCs. The spread of Google's AI tools to IoT devices could also help Google take on Amazon, whose Alexa voice assistant dominated CES this year. Alexa is being incorporated into cars, home appliances, and numerous gadgets. Companies like Microsoft, Samsung, and Intel have also been chasing makers. Microsoft's Windows 10 IoT Core is compatible with Raspberry Pi 3, and makers get access to analytics and machine-learning tools in the Azure cloud. Samsung is providing its Artik Board users access to the Artik Cloud, through which makers can access to data analysis services and AI technologies. Artik Cloud also works with Raspberry Pi boards, Amazon Echo, Nest devices, and wearables like Fitbit trackers. It's possible Google could make the machine-learning framework called TensorFlow available to makers. The software could help devices learn based on patterns, input, and trends. But boards don't have much processing power, so the tools could push back decision-making to Google's cloud, which has more powerful AI and data-analysis tools. For example, a robot may have limited image recognition technology and may instead consult the cloud when trying to identify an obstacle. Some companies like Movidius -- which is a part of Intel -- have modified TensorFlow code to improve computer vision in robots and drones. Google is also finalizing its IoT technology called Android Things, a lightweight version of the Android OS. The company hasn't talked about AI technologies available in Android Things.

Google parent misses quarterly profit estimates as shares plunge Results raise concerns that growth in the company's ad business is slowing Posted a stronger-than-expected 22.2 percent increase in quarterly revenue By Reuters Published: 17:08 EST, 26 January 2017 | Updated: 17:49 EST, 26 January 2017 e-mail 5 shares 3 View comments Google parent Alphabet posted fourth-quarter profit below analysts' estimates on Thursday, sending its shares down 2.7 percent in late trade and raising concerns that growth in the company's powerhouse advertising business may be slowing. The company, however, posted a stronger-than-expected 22.2 percent increase in quarterly revenue as advertisers spent more to reach an expanding user base that spends more time on smartphones and YouTube. Google's ad revenue, which accounts for the bulk of its business, rose 17.4 percent to $22.40 billion in the fourth quarter. Google parent Alphabet Inc posted fourth-quarter profit below analysts' estimates on Thursday, raising concerns that growth in the company's powerhouse advertising business may be slowing. 'Our growth in the fourth quarter was exceptional -- with revenues up 22% year on year and 24% on a constant currency basis.  'This performance was led by mobile search and YouTube.  'We're seeing great momentum in Google's newer investment areas and ongoing strong progress in Other Bets,' said Ruth Porat, CFO of Alphabet.

ALPHABET'S SLIPPING SHARES Google parent Alphabet posted fourth-quarter profit below analysts' estimates on Thursday, sending its shares down 2.7 percent in late trade and raising concerns that growth in the company's powerhouse advertising business may be slowing.  FindTheCompany | Graphiq   Research firm eMarketer has estimated that Google will capture $60.92 billion in search ad revenue this year, or 58.8 percent of the search ad market worldwide. Paid clicks, or clicks on Google ads, rose 36 percent, compared with a 33 percent increase in the third quarter.  Paid clicks are those ads on which an advertiser pays only if a user clicks on them. Analysts on average had expected a rise of 26.9 percent, according to FactSet StreetAccount. Cost-per-click dropped 9 percent, a slide that has continued as Google sells more mobile ads, which command lower prices.  However, the shift is not necessarily alarming as it suggests Google is selling more ads on YouTube, which are seen as a key growth driver, Rice said. GOOGLE'S PIXEL GAMBLE  The Pixel phone, Google's answer to Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy, is off to a promising start - but might have done even better had Google managed consumer demand as smartly as the device's sleek design. Although Google hasn't released sales figures, industry researchers say the Pixel has been a hot item since its October debut was greeted with mostly glowing reviews and the biggest marketing blitz in Google's 18-year history. The Pixel phone, Google's answer to Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy, is off to a promising start But there were missed opportunities. Google didn't have enough Pixels available to meet demand. Rather than wait several weeks, many consumers interested in the Pixel probably bought an iPhone, Galaxy or another phone instead. And these people aren't likely to need a phone replacement for another year or two. Google also struck a deal to sell it through just one wireless carrier, Verizon. Although Google's online store sold Pixels compatible with other wireless networks, most people don't shop for phones that way. Of course, it's a moot point if there weren't enough Pixels to sell, but Google likely would have produced more if it had distribution deals with other carriers. It's not surprising that Google misjudged the market, given that this is the search company's first stab at making its own phone. Previously, it partnered with various manufacturers on a Nexus line of phones to showcase its Android operating system, but that effort barely made a dent. 'This was probably a really good learning experience for them,' says Neil Doshi, an analyst with Mizhuo Securities USA.   Alphabet's Other Bets revenue increased to $262 million from $150 million a year earlier, while the operating loss of $1.09 billion narrowed from $1.21 billion. Other Bets includes broadband business Google Fiber, home automation products Nest, self-driving technology company Waymo as well as X, the company's research facility that works on 'moon shot' ventures. Alphabet's net income rose to $5.33 billion, or $7.56 per Class A and B share and Class C capital stock, in the fourth quarter, from $4.92 billion, or $7.06 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned $9.36 per share, below the average estimate of $9.64 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company's consolidated revenue rose to $26.06 billion above the average estimate of $25.26 billion. Shares of the company slipped to $834 in extended trade after closing at $856.98 on Nasdaq.  Share or comment on this article e-mail 5 shares Most watched News videos 'There goes that relationship' Trump's quip to BBC question Graphic: NZ Breakers player's eye dislodged in horrific injury Pizza Hut customer finds workers in the back of empty restaurant in Bristol Shocking CCTV shows car speed into Humber Bridge barrier Heartwarming scene as Grayce shares her puppies with owner Florida couple passed out in their car with two children in the backseat A close look at the huge crack formed across Arizona desert Bizarre footage of multiple UFOs hovering near Mexican border Enraged man punches laptop and quits job during 'meltdown' at airport Alarming moment guy violently pushes man onto tube tracks CCTV shows brave man fighting nunchuck-wielding robbers Inauguration etiquette 101: Escort First Lady up White House steps First ladies first?

Image: DUSTIN DRANKOSKI/MASHABLE By Kerry Flynn2017-01-26 21:53:02 UTC Search, clicks and views aren't everything for Google anymore.  Alphabet, the technology giant formerly known as Google, still makes majority of its revenue from ads, but it's starting to build big gains elsewhere.  SEE ALSO: Google's PR team penned the mother of all replies Google reported $3.7 billion in other revenue, including hardware and leaving out advertising, for the fourth quarter of 2016. In the grand scheme of Alphabet, that's quite small. It was bump up by 62 percent from the year prior. For Google, that's good.  “Our growth in the fourth quarter was exceptional," said Ruth Porat, CFO of Alphabet, in a statement. "This performance was led by mobile search and YouTube. We’re seeing great momentum in Google’s newer investment areas and ongoing strong progress in Other Bets." "Exceptional" hasn't really been visible for "other bets" prior. Other bets are still such a tiny part of Google's revenue, but it's finally starting to move the needle — and not into the red.  Updated $GOOG numbers, still lol https://t.co/ololMFLXLH pic.twitter.com/DuhmXWF1EI — Mike Murphy (@mcwm) January 26, 2017 That's an important move for Google. The company is still winning in the ad department, despite fake news sites being purged from using its ad service. But that's a shrinking market. Web and mobile ads are dropping in value. Google’s cost-per-click dropped 15 percent in the fourth quarter from the same period the year prior.  Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the company is prioritizing YouTube, integrating more machine learning to improve content and advertising. Facebook, Snapchat and other over-the-top services are biting into that as they all look to pull from TV budgets. "I think it's important for us to work in the intersection of hardware, software and services," Pichai said Thursday on a call with analysts.  Google has been making big moves in hardware. The company released its new line of smartphones called Pixel and Pixel XL in October, which is competing with Apple's iPhone. Google didn't break out how much money is coming from the new smartphones. Analysts predictions are all over the place, some pegging it at just over 500,000 and others at 1 million. It's still early days for Pixel smartphones. For now, it's limited to Verizon customers.  Google later released Google Home, its answer to Amazon Echo, a home speaker powered by a digital assistant.  "We are committed to this to the longterm as a great way to bring a seamless Google experience," Pichai said. "You can expect to see us expand our offerings thoughtfully." Google Daydream is its first VR headset, a step down from Facebook's Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. It competes with the likes of Samsung Gear VR.  But the concern around Facebook's competition extends beyond the digital ad duopoly and into video and VR. Facebook is also betting on video consumption in its platform. Facebook revealed earlier Thursday a new emphasis on longer videos in News Feed, and, on Wednesday, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Hugo Barra (a well-respected former Googler) will run its virtual reality division. In a move that'll please investors, Alphabet has cut its losses on some efforts, known as "Other Bets." The company halted the expansion of Google Fiber, its internet project, in October last year. Those cutbacks included layoffs of employees. Craig Barratt, CEO of Google Access, also stepped down.  I feel like this label is probably relevant.

Alphabet (GOOGL, Tech30), Google's parent company, lost nearly $1.1 billion from its "other bets" division in the fourth quarter of 2016. By Seth Fiegerman NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Google is still struggling to bring the expenses for its moonshot projects back to earth. Alphabet, Google's parent company, lost nearly $1.1 billion from its "other bets" division in the fourth quarter of 2016, according to earnings results on Thursday. That brings the total loss for this division to about $3.6 billion in 2016, slightly more than the year before. The "other bets" portion of its business includes ambitious projects like self-driving cars, life sciences research and high-speed Internet access. Since restructuring as Alphabet, the company has pushed for more financial discipline and accountability from its riskiest ventures. Alphabet shuttered a project to beam Internet to rural areas with solar-powered drones, halted the expansion of its costly Google Fiber effort, and forced Nest to cut costs and pay for its own legal and PR expenses. At the same time, the company has moved other moonshot projects closer to market. In December, Alphabet spun off its self-driving car program into a separate company called Waymo and began working on partnerships with automakers. "We continue to calibrate the magnitude and pace of investments [for other bets]," Ruth Porat, Alphabet's CFO, said on a conference call Thursday. While the losses for its moonshot projects remained essentially unchanged, Alphabet did manage to grow revenue from this division substantially. Alphabet's other bets posted sales of $808 million for the full year, up 82% from a year earlier. Porat said much of that sales growth came from Nest, Fiber and Verily, its life sciences division. But that remains a drop in the bucket for the company. Alphabet's overall sales for the quarter topped $26 billion, a gain of 22% from a year earlier. However, Alphabet's earnings fell short of Wall Street estimates, pushing the stock down by 2% in after hours trading. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

(Graham Hughes/CP) You can make the case that, at the outset of 2017, no business can afford not to be a technology company. Technology has so pervaded the day-to-day operations of virtually any company—not to mention the behaviour of its customers—that very few leaders can afford to ignore the prevailing trends. So, we asked five of Canada’s top tech executives to reveal the trends they’re most excited to witness—and participate in—over the year ahead: 1. Canada will become an AI leader “I’m a technology optimist. We’re entering a new era in which people will experience computing more naturally and seamlessly in the context of their lives, powered by intelligent assistance and the cloud. This transition is as significant as the move over the last decade from desktops to mobile devices. How Google's Canadian office design encourages collaboration “I’m particularly excited to see how advances in artificial intelligence and deep learning research in 2017 will make a material impact on the consumer products we interact with every day. I also expect to see indications of AI making positive contributions to health sciences. “This is a particularly exciting moment for Canada, which is fast becoming a global powerhouse in AI. The pioneering work of Yoshua Bengio at the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms and Geoffrey Hinton, who splits his time between Google Toronto and his lab at University of Toronto, has fostered a rich culture of academic research in Canada. And what we’re seeing right now is academic institutions, large companies, startups, incubators and federal investment coming together to support a shared vision: To make Canada the global leader in AI research. It’s really exciting to see this kind of focus in Canada on a technology that will define innovation for years to ” —Sam Sebastian, managing director, Google Canada 2. Every business will undergo digital transformation Cisco's Bernadette Wightman on what's next for the Internet of Things “I’m excited to see what’s possible in this new world of digital transformation. Businesses and organizations are now recognizing the essential role technology will play in their ability to not only thrive, but to simply survive in this new digital world. Digital transformation is changing every industry – and we expect 2017 to be a hallmark year for innovation in the areas of clean energy, improved health care, better customer interactions and operational efficiencies. Disruptive technologies such as blockchain, virtual reality and mixed reality, AI and the Internet of Things will have increased demonstrable applications in Canada and around the world. Canadian entrepreneurs and startups have a leading role to play here, keeping our brilliant minds and new graduates here at home in Canada. ” —Bernadette Wightman, president, Cisco Canada 3. Social media will pervade all facets of customer behaviour How Hootsuite built a cool office (that makes people work harder) “Social media is playing a bigger role in every phase of the customer lifecycle: not just as a marketing tool, but for everything from sales to customer service, too. The surge of chatbots on platforms like Facebook Messenger shows just how scalable social customer service can be, and I think we’ll see major progress here in 2017. At the same time, we’re suddenly seeing CEOs and top leadership taking the lead in championing social media for their companies. This all points to a kind of emerging consciousness that social media is the best—and maybe the only—place to reach customers, employees and stakeholders right now.” —Ryan Holmes, founder and CEO, Hootsuite 4. Fintech disruption will be the new media disruption Michele Romanow's secret to succcess? Launch now, fix later “I’m excited about the change I’m seeing with fintech. Ten years ago is when we disrupted the media industry [at Buytopia, where Romanow was co-founder]. With the recent U.S. election, you can see that the way that we consume media is fundamentally different than the way we did 10 years ago. Now I see that transformation in financial world. I think that the way that we manage, control and invest our money is going to really change in the next 10 years, and a lot of that innovation is happening right now and is coming from Canada. That’s what’s making me excited going into 2017.” —Michele Romanow, entrepreneur and investor on CBC’s Dragons’ Den 5. Wearables will integrate more seamlessly into daily life Thalmic Labs CEO Stephen Lake on mainstreaming wearables “Wearables continued to fight and make traction in 2016, but new form factors will open up new possibilities in 2017. “Now that we have the investments and R&D in place [Thalmic raised US$120 million in venture capital in October 2016], I’m most excited for 2017 to be the year that we further push the boundaries of human-computer interaction bringing new technologies to market, and become one year closer to our vision of a more seamless future.” —Stephen Lake, co-founder and CEO, Thalmic Labs MORE ON TECHNOLOGY: The four technologies that really mattered at CES 2017 How the Internet of Things is going to transform retail Want to build a truly innovative economy?

After all that’s where DeepMind came from. Google, Facebook and Amazon are investing heavily in this region, but the UK has huge leadership in the field of AI. All the big tech firms also know this.

Advertisement Advertisement If you're heading out to eat without a pre-booked reservation—and wondering whether there's already a long wait at your favorite restaurant—now you won't have to call ahead. In its latest update, Google Maps will show you exactly how busy restaurants are—in real time. For a while, now, Google Maps has featured "Popular Times" in restaurant listings. "Popular times are based on average popularity over the last several weeks," the search engine FAQ explains—and it's predictive, not live. "Popularity for any given hour is shown relative to the typical peak popularity for the business for the week." As of the iOS app's most recent update, today, Google Maps will showcase live visit data, which is updated in real time. There's also a new feature that show the average amount of time customers spend in the restaurant. How does Google do it? Well, when Popular Times first rolled out, Google used "anonymous mobile positioning data" to gather information about customer movements. The new live tool, "rolls real-time smartphone location data into its crowd estimate algorithm," explains AppleInsider, "allowing more accurate and timely results." This functionality was first rolled out to Google Maps' desktop experience in November, just before Black Friday—and now it's finally available on the mobile app. Google Maps isn't the only way to save yourself time at no-reservation restaurants. Last August, mobile app Nowait rolled out to users. The app partnered with over 4,000 restaurants nationwide to allow customers to put their names down for tables remotely—and receive a text when their tables are ready. "For restaurants, Nowait integrates, streamlines, and optimizes the entire front of house—from waitlists to table turnover to analytics and more—so that they efficiently provide amazing service," Nowait's website explains. "Guests use Nowait to add themselves to a restaurant's list, get texted when their table is ready, and privately rate their experiences at the end of the meal. Easy to use and even easier to love, Nowait provides the ideal restaurant experience for both sides of the table."

REUTERS/Regis Duvignau By Julia Love and Anya George Tharakan Google parent Alphabet Inc posted fourth-quarter profit below analysts' estimates on Thursday, hurt by a higher tax rate, but analysts cheered the company's progress in diversifying its business beyond advertising. While advertising still accounts for the lion's share of Google's revenue, rising 17.4 percent to $22.4 billion in the quarter, Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat underscored that the company is broadening its business - pointing to growth in hardware, app sales and the cloud business. The company's other revenue, which captures such businesses, climbed 62 percent to $3.4 billion. "We see tremendous potential ahead for these businesses, as well as in the continued development of non-advertising revenue streams for YouTube," Porat said on a call with investors. The results were met with a mixed reaction from Wall Street, which sent shares down 2.2 percent to $838 in extended trade after closing at $856.98 on Nasdaq. Google faced a higher tax rate of 22 percent, compared to 19 percent for the year overall, contributing to the dent in profitability. "If you look above that, it’s business as usual," said analyst James Wang of ARK Investment Management. "There has been no margin compression in the actual business." Executives suggested that they are beginning to reap the rewards of their investment in hardware. Porat spotlighted the company's line of Nest smart home products, saying sales doubled during the key holiday period including Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Google-branded hardware also showed promise as Google Home, a smart speaker, and the Pixel smartphone gained traction over the holidays, Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said during the call. "We’re committed to this for the long term as a great way to bring a beautiful, seamless Google experience to people," he said. The company posted a stronger-than-expected 22.2 percent increase in quarterly revenue as advertisers spent more to reach an expanding user base that spends more time on smartphones and YouTube. Research firm eMarketer has estimated that Google will capture $60.92 billion in search ad revenue this year, or 58.8 percent of the search ad market worldwide. Paid clicks, or clicks on Google ads, rose 36 percent, compared with a 33 percent increase in the third quarter. Paid clicks are those ads on which an advertiser pays only if a user clicks on them. Analysts on average had expected a rise of 26.9 percent, according to FactSet StreetAccount. Cost-per-click dropped 9 percent, a slide that has continued as Google sells more mobile ads, which command lower prices. However, the shift is not necessarily alarming as it suggests Google is selling more ads on YouTube, which are seen as a key growth driver, Rice said. Alphabet's Other Bets revenue increased to $262 million from $150 million a year earlier, while the operating loss of $1.09 billion narrowed from $1.21 billion. Other Bets includes broadband business Google Fiber, home automation products Nest, self-driving technology company Waymo as well as X, the company's research facility that works on "moon shot" ventures. Verily Life Sciences, one such bet, announced Thursday that Singapore-based investment company Temasek had invested $800 million for a minority stake in the company. The investment reflects Alphabet's greater fiscal discipline under Porat and suggests a potential new model for the other bets, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. "Getting external investors involved helps spread that risk out and reduces Google’s exposure," he said. "It also allows some things to move faster than they would if it were just Google's cash backing them." Alphabet's net income rose to $5.33 billion, or $7.56 per Class A and B share and Class C capital stock, in the fourth quarter, from $4.92 billion, or $7.06 per share, a year earlier.

Name: Subject: Message: Find out how bad parking will be at your destination with this Google Maps update Apps & Games Newsby Team AA1 day ago 442 8 Google Maps is usually pretty accurate when it comes to estimating the time it’ll take to get to your destination, but getting there is only half the battle. If you’ve ever driven to a concert, restaurant or any other public place in a major city, you’re probably aware that trying to find a parking space can be a huge hassle. Like, a really huge hassle. That’s why, with the latest Google Maps update, the popular navigation app will start estimating how long it will take to park at your destination. Right next to the travel time estimation and distance, you’ll find a little ‘P’ icon that will tell you if parking at that destination will be limited, medium or easy based on historical parking data. Google is rolling out this feature to 25 metro areas throughout the U.S., starting today. The list of metro areas can be found below: San Francisco Seattle Miami Atlanta Boston Charlotte Chicago Detroit Los Angeles Minneapolis/St. Paul New York City Orlando Philadelphia Pittsburgh San Diego St. Louis Tampa Washington, DC Cleveland Dallas/Fort Worth Denver Houston Phoenix Portland Sacramento See also: Best GPS app and navigation app options for Android April 14, 2016 That’s not all, though. The company is also rolling out yet another Google Maps update that will help make it easier to find the hotel that’s right for you. Now, when you search for a hotel, motel or other similar lodging, Google Maps will display an album of amenities that you can find at that location. So, if you’re looking for a hotel with a big pool, for instance, this feature could be particularly useful, as you’d be able to check out a photo of the pool without the need to check out the hotel website. It appears most of the photos in these albums right now are provided by hotel websites, but it likely won’t be long until user-submitted shots start appearing. This is likely a simple server-side update, so this feature should already be available to you as long as you’re running version 9.44.0 and above. It’s always a good idea to keep your apps updated, though, so head to the Play Store link below to grab the latest Google Maps update. Previous updates Uber integration and new UI improvements January 12: Google has brought full Uber integration to Maps on Android, allowing you to book, complete and pay for an Uber ride directly within the app. There’s also a new interface in Maps that shows the types of ride options you have in a particular location. Tons of new voice commands September 29: A ton of new voice commands are now available within Google Maps on Android, allowing you to mute, show route overview, avoid tolls, and much more, all while using your voice. A full list of the new voice commands can be found here. Speed limit signs September 14: While this feature may not be live for everyone, Google Maps has started showing speed limit signs on certain roads. These signs appear as small, unobtrusive notifications on the bottom-left of the navigation display.

But its other wild bets are starting to make more money. Tech Industry by Richard Nieva January 26, 2017 1:37 PM PST @richardjnieva Up Next Beautiful scene shows universe is growing quicker than we knew Google has been scaling back on some of its moon shots. Justin Sullivan, Getty Images In the past few years, Google has become known for more than just its iconic search engine. You know, the one that tells you at a moment's notice the population of San Diego or what movie won the best picture Oscar in 1952 (1.3 million and "An American in Paris," respectively). It's also become known for its Jetson's-like ambitions: cars shuttling people around sans human drivers, high-flying balloons that beam Wi-Fi to remote regions, and nanoparticles that aim to detect cancer in early stages. When you describe something as "googley" in Silicon Valley, people know what you mean -- whimsical, scientific and with a dash of free food. It looks like some of those moon shots, called "Other Bets" in Google parlance, are starting to pay off. Google's parent company, Alphabet, said Thursday that, as a whole, those bets made $260 million in sales in the fourth quarter, compared to $150 million the year before. The costs associated with those bets also fell: The company spent $1.08 billion on Other Bets in the fourth quarter, versus $1.21 billion in the same period the year before. Alphabet also gave us a snapshot of how its business is doing overall. In the three months ended December 31, it recorded $26.06 billion in sales, surpassing analyst forecasts of $25.22 billion. Profit, after some costs, was $9.36 a share, falling short of analyst expectations of $9.67 per share. "We're seeing great momentum in Google's newer investment areas and ongoing strong progress in Other Bets," Ruth Porat, Alphabet's CFO, said in a statement. Moon shots downed In the last few months, Google has stepped up scrutiny of its moon shots, with some of them shut down or scaled back. There are a few reasons for that. Failure comes with the territory. Astro Teller, who runs the X lab, the self-described moon shot factory that develops most of the company's secretive projects, touts a now-cliched mantra: "Fail fast." "We work hard at X to make it safe to fail," Teller said during a keynote speech at South by Southwest last year. "We killed over 100 investigations last year alone." Another likely reason is Porat, chief money minder. A Morgan Stanley veteran, she arrived in March 2015 to great fanfare. "Ruthless Ruth," as she's reportedly called among Google's rank and file, is apparently notorious for cutting projects deemed too expensive or that haven't captured the excitement of Alphabet CEO Larry Page. "The internal transparency we've provided to our business leaders across the Other Bets and Google is helping us to allocate resources more thoughtfully across the opportunities that we see," Porat said during a conference call with analysts Thursday. It's hard to argue with her calls. After her first earnings report on the job, Google's market value swelled by $60 billion the next day, the biggest one-day gain for any company in history. But while that's no doubt tickled Wall Street, it's come at the expense of some of those pie-in-the-sky, dare-to-dream projects. Among some of the scaled-back efforts: the robotics division. It was started by Android creator Andy Rubin, who built it up thanks to an acquisition spree that included at least 11 companies in 2013. But after Rubin left Google in 2014, the effort was rudderless. The robotics division was eventually swallowed up by X, before Teller put the kibosh on it completely. The company also decided to halt expansion of its high-speed internet service, called Fiber, though it will continue operations in eight cities where it's already in place. Google also scaled back its efforts with drones and is now mostly focusing on trying to use them as a delivery service for things like pizza and groceries instead of for spreading internet connectivity. "As we reach for moon shots that will have a big impact in the longer-term, it's inevitable that there will be course corrections along the way," Porat said in October. "Some efforts will be more successful than others." CNET Magazine: Check out a sampling of the stories you'll find in CNET's newsstand edition.

Alphabet, Google’s parent company, lost nearly $1.1 billion from its “other bets” division in the fourth quarter of 2016, according to earnings results on Thursday. That brings the total loss for this division to about $3.6 billion in 2016, slightly more than the year before. The “other bets” portion of its business includes ambitious projects like self-driving cars, life sciences research and high-speed Internet access. Since restructuring as Alphabet, the company has pushed for more financial discipline and accountability from its riskiest ventures. Alphabet shuttered a project to beam Internet to rural areas with solar-powered drones, halted the expansion of its costly Google Fiber effort, and forced Nest to cut costs and pay for its own legal and PR expenses. At the same time, the company has moved other moonshot projects closer to market. In December, Alphabet spun off its self-driving car program into a separate company called Waymo and began working on partnerships with automakers. “We continue to calibrate the magnitude and pace of investments [for other bets],” Ruth Porat, Alphabet’s CFO, said on a conference call Thursday. While the losses for its moonshot projects remained essentially unchanged, Alphabet did manage to grow revenue from this division substantially. Alphabet’s other bets posted sales of $808 million for the full year, up 82% from a year earlier. Porat said much of that sales growth came from Nest, Fiber and Verily, its life sciences division. But that remains a drop in the bucket for the company. Alphabet’s overall sales for the quarter topped $26 billion, a gain of 22% from a year earlier. However, Alphabet’s earnings fell short of Wall Street estimates, pushing the stock down by 2% in after hours trading.

Covering the final three months of the year, these numbers notably include the first holiday season featuring the Google-made Pixel and Home. While beating analyst expectations, the stock is down in after-hours trading. Revenue is up 22% from $21.3 billion in Q4 2015, with net income at $5.3 billion for this quarter. For comparison, Alphabet reported $22.4 billion in revenue and $5 billion in net income last quarter. Not reported separately, Google’s hardware sales are grouped together with Play Store sales, enterprise efforts, and more in “Other Revenues.” Year-over-year, it is up 62% to $3.4 billion and a notable increase from $2.4 billion last quarter. CFO Ruth Porat notes, “great momentum in Google’s newer investment areas and ongoing strong progress in Other Bet.” The much-analyzed “Other Bets” is again losing money, but continues to show increased revenue from the previous quarter. Revenues were $262 million and an operating loss of $1 billion. Since last quarter, Alphabet has made a number of significant moves in regard to its subsidiaries. The self-driving car project was spun out as its own company called Waymo and continues testing with their latest vehicle from Chrysler. Meanwhile, streamlining is still underway with the Project Wing delivery drone on pause and internet-oriented Project Titan shut down. Meanwhile, the Terra Bella satellite division working on live imagery is being sold off. As usual, Alphabet will hold an earnings call with investors and members of the press to further break down numbers from its Q4 2016 earnings release.

Google hasn't released sales figures, but industry researchers say the Pixel has been a hot item since its October debut. One analyst estimates at least 1 million Pixels were sold in the past quarter, even though Google didn't do enough to keep the phone in stock. Google can afford to make some mistakes because digital advertising network is so lucrative. Alphabet, Google's corporate parent, provided another reminder of its financial might with Thursday's release of its fourth-quarter earnings.

Related: Google Pixel 2 - 5 features it must have A 9to5Google source says the firm is looking to further improve the excellent camera, which we called ‘the best on any phone to date.’ According to the person familiar with Google’s plans, waterproofing the sequel is also on the table. The report says Google is looking at two differing chipsets which, unfortunately, would give it an even higher price tag. Given we debated whether these handsets (at £599/£719 respectively) were overpriced, a bump 12 months on is unlikely to go down too well. However, there may be hope for those operating at the lower end of the market, according to the report. “Finally, the same source says Google has lately been testing lower-end Pixel devices which would bring lesser specs and a much lower price tag,” the report says. Given the Pixel phones weren’t released until October last year, we’re unlikely to see follow ups until the autumn. Google has confirmed its annual I/O conference will kick of on May 17, which definitely sounds too soon. What do you want from a Google Pixel 2? Share your thoughts in the comments below.

Jänner 2017, 06:00 4 Postings "Bad Ads"-Bericht des Onlinewerberiesen: 1,7 Milliarden Banner gelöscht – Doppelt so viel Werbung wie 2015 Mountain View/Wien – Die Information zu Fake News und anderen irreführenden – quasi redaktionellen – Inhalten steht weit unten im alljährlichen Google-Report, der sich eigentlich den Bad Ads widmet, die der globale Onlinewerberiese im Vorjahr gelöscht hat. 200 Seitenbetreiber sperrte Google demnach dauerhaft von seiner Werbevermarktung. Erst im November 2016, nach der US-Präsidentenwahl, hat Google seine Nutzungsbedingungen in Sachen Fake News verschärft: Sie richten sich einerseits gegen Webseiten, die etwa vortäuschen, sie wären Info-Portale, und Seiten mit irreführenden Inhalten. Fake News, Fake Publishers: 340 in zwei Monaten Im November und Dezember 2016 hat Google nach eigenen Angaben 550 Seiten geprüft, die im Verdacht standen, falsche Inhalte zu veröffentlichen und/oder so zu tun, als wären sie Medienseiten. Gegen 340 dieser 550 Portale wurde Google nach eigenen Angaben wegen Fake News oder anderer Verstöße gegen die (neue) Policy aktiv. "Fast 200" der Betreiber wurden laut Google von dessen Werbevermarktung "dauerhaft ausgeschlossen" – eine eher höfliche Übersetzung von "kicked out". Abgedreht: 1,7 Milliarden Werbe-Aktivitäten Kicked out hat Google 2016 nach eigenen Angaben auch 1,7 Milliarden Werbemittel, mehr als doppelt soviele wie 2015. Google führt diese doch recht dramatische Steigerung zurück auf erweiterte Geschäftsbedingungen gegen irreführende und täuschende Werbung. Verschärft wurden demnach auch die technischen Vorkehrungen gegen "trick to click"-Fenster, die Google als "Ads" klassifiziert: Sie sehen aus wie Warnungen des Betriebssystems, die zum Klicken auffordern und dann Schadsoftware installieren. Der Google-Report kündet von 112 Millionen solcher – entdeckter – "Ads", sechsmal soviele wie 2015.

Nexus 5X Is Now Running Sailfish OS, Because Why Not GO An unofficial port that still needs some work Jan 26, 2017 21:34 GMT  ·  By Andrei Vlad  ·  Share:  The Nexus 5X is the result of the collaboration between Google and LG. It's a solid device that's been recently updated to Android 7.1.1 Nougat, but will probably never get another major OS upgrade since it will be more than two years old when Google releases Android O. So, instead of throwing the phone into the bin of forgetfulness, the good folks roaming on XDA forums have decided to keep the Nexus 5X alive by any means possible. XDA Senior Member m4r0v3r managed to cook a port of Jolla's Sailfish OS for the Nexus 5X. It's quite refreshing to know that this type of devices would be able to run just about any operating system out there with a little bit of tinkering. Since this is the first release, if you own a Nexus 5X and want to check out what Sailfish OS has to offer, then you should know there are still a couple of issues that must be addressed. First of all, there are some functions that will stop working if you install the Sailfish OS port on the Nexus 5X. Play Video For example, if you need your camera to take pictures, you shouldn't install the ROM yet since it will disable the Nexus 5X's camera. Furthermore, the fingerprint sensor and Bluetooth connectivity won't work either. On the bright side, the creator of the port confirms that the audio (including music) is working smoothly, as well as calls, texts, data and Wi-Fi connectivity. However, future builds could address these problems, so that Nexus 5X owners can use the Sailfish OS port as their daily driver. If you're into installing custom ROMs, all the information you need to put Sailfish OS on your Nexus 5X has been posted on the original thread on XDA forum. Make sure you back up all your information before flashing the Sailfish OS port on your Nexus 5X, since you'll most likely lose everything if you don't. #Nexus 5X#Sailfish OS#Nexus 5X ROM#Sailfish port#XDA forums subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Nexus 5X and 6P Affected by In-Car Bluetooth Issues After Android 7.1.1 Update Google Rolls Out Android 7.1.1 Nougat Update to Nexus and Pixel Devices Android 7.1.1 Nougat Coming to Nexus Devices in Early December LG Giving Full Refunds for Some Defective Nexus 5X Units Windows 10 Mobile Start Screen vs. iOS Home Screen: Beauty and the Beast Let’s Chat: With or Without an Antivirus in Windows 10?

Twitter bird Credit: Marisa Allegra Williams for Twitter Most Popular The past year has not been kind to Twitter. User growth has slowed. Trolls, bots and abuse continue to be problems. And marketers have complained that product innovation has not kept pace with competitors. Following an unsuccessful attempt to sell itself this fall, Twitter is back to going it alone. Yet despite its troubles, Twitter remains a distinctive platform with a massive audience and the ability to deliver outsized returns in the right situations. Immediacy, organic reach, content discovery and lighter algorithmic curation of what users see are areas where Twitter shines. Consequently, the most effective strategies are the ones that best leverage these unique attributes. Where does Twitter offer marketers the best opportunities? Here are four areas: 1. Target people based on what they are saying. Twitter is unique as a social platform in allowing marketers to target audiences not just on behavior, demographics and interests, but also by what they are saying via real-time keywords. This is a powerful capability that enables brands to identify and capitalize on moments when a consumer is likely to be most receptive to a particular marketing message. For example, a manufacturer of Apple peripherals could target ads to people tweeting about getting a new MacBook, iPhone, or iPad. A cosmetics brand could reach consumers discussing a specific fashion look with a how-to guide on how to create that look using the brand's products. It's an extra level of precision that goes beyond simply identifying people who are generally relevant to a brand's business (someone interested in Apple hardware or cosmetics) to people who are relevant right now. Tweet-based keyword targeting also allows brands to identify people who they normally wouldn't advertise to. The same cosmetics manufacturer could show ads to men tweeting about or engaging with content about gifts for wives or girlfriends. 2. Boost search success. Because Twitter content is surfaced in Google's search results, having a strong Twitter presence is a great way to gain organic reach outside of the Twitter platform. For instance, a Google search for a retail brand will bring up not just the retailer's website but the company's Twitter feed -- often as the second or third result. Consumers can view a short selection of recent tweets on the search-results page, and then click through to Twitter to explore in more depth. Twitter also benefits Google search results behind the scenes. When a brand links its social channels to its website, Google will crawl those channels and use the content for weighting its results. This can be particularly useful in helping brands improve their results for generic searches that are relevant to them. It would allow, for instance, a car manufacturer to place higher in organic searches for "new car" or an apparel brand in to place higher in searches for "fall fashion trends." 3. Promote original content and capitalize on real-time events. People go to Twitter to discover interesting content and stay on the pulse of breaking news. Unlike Facebook and Instagram, where the content comes to you via an algorithmically-curated newsfeed, Twitter allows users more control of their timeline, enabling them to directly follow content from media outlets and influential users. This makes Twitter an incredible, organic content distribution platform, especially for brands or influential people who have an established following outside of Twitter. The nature of this user-directed experience also means that Twitter users are more likely to be open to other new content -- content that educates, informs, or provides insight into real-time, breaking events. Marketers can feed this appetite by serving as a resource on topics people are talking about and seeking information on. The trick is identifying what matters to your audience and where your brand is best positioned to add legitimate value to the conversation. Take a retailer capitalizing on buzz during Black Friday weekend by outpricing the competition in real-time, owning the conversation around the best deals and feeding coupons and information to users flocking to Twitter to find sales. Or a financial firm providing insight into what the recent Federal Reserve rate hike means for credit card or mortgage rates. 4. Use Twitter's "Firehose" as the ultimate media planning tool. The Twitter "Firehose" is the raw stream of tweets (500 million per day) and associated data that marketers can access through a handful of third party Twitter partners. The Firehose is a goldmine for media planning, allowing brands to gain a phenomenally detailed understanding of how people are discussing their company and their products -- and see how these discussions fit into the overall market landscape. Before launching a campaign, Firehose data can be used to identify relevant audiences, as well as pinpoint what marketing approaches might work best, based on the conversations they are having. For instance, knowing that key audiences are negatively disposed towards conspicuous consumption, a fashion brand could highlight messages around comfort and utility, or focus on higher-order issues such as being of service to others. During campaigns, real-time Twitter data is an excellent tool for monitoring response and then using this data to craft responsive media elements. When Lexus launched an initial 37-second teaser video for its SLIDE hoverboard, conversation on Twitter exploded immediately. A key finding was that no one believed it was real. Lexus used this information to create follow-up messaging that addressed these questions, featuring interviews with pro skater Ross McGouran, who discussed the experience of riding the liquid nitrogen-powered hoverboard. The result? Lexus achieved better engagement with those interested in the story. In this article: DigitalNext Social James Chanter James Chanter is associate media director at m/SIX.

Analysts were expecting revenue to jump around 18 percent to more than $25 billion. Alphabet bested that with revenue of just over $26 billion, up 22 percent over the same period last year. Some analysts had predicted income of $9.64 per share, a new record for profit in a single quarter by the company. Alphabet fell a little short of that, notching $9.36 per share, which translates to a profit of $6.59 billion. Alphabet’s “Other Bets” division, which includes everything outside Google and YouTube, managed to reduce its losses. It lost $1.21 billion in the fourth quarter of last year, and just $1.08 billion for the same period in 2016. Of course, the improvement did not come easy. In an effort to improve financial performance Alphabet has spun out its driverless car project into a standalone company, Waymo. And as financial goals become more demanding, many of its high-profile moonshots, including Google Glass, Project Loon, Project Wing, and Google Fiber have lost key executives. As always the core of Google’s business, and thus Alphabet’s revenue, is advertising. The biggest areas of growth this quarter — YouTube, mobile, and programatic advertising — didn’t change the ongoing trend. When asked, Google decline to give any solid numbers on signups for its YouTube Red subscription service. But Google, like Amazon and Microsoft, has been banking on cloud services to drive its future revenue growth. “And as we head into 2017, I expect Cloud to be one of our largest areas of investment and headcount growth,” said CEO Sundar Pichai on last quarter’s earnings call. This quarter Pichai highlighted data analytics and security as two verticals where he belives Google’s offerings are emerging as the industry leader. Much of the progress here is driven by artificial intelligence, and Pichai said the company had over 350 product launches in 2016 which were powered by advances in machine learning. But the company has also moved aggressively into hardware, producing its own line of Pixel smartphones and the Google Home smart speaker which competes directly with Amazon’s Echo. No specifics were provided on sales. Pichai did say that he sees personal computing moving beyond a device or two. He believes the company’s strength in voice control means its well positioned for a world in which computing is available in whatever context - phones, homes, televisions, and cars, work, etc - a consumer might find themselves. “It’s really important for us to work at the intersection of hardware, software, and services,” said Pichai on today’s call.

While advertising still accounts for the lion's share of Google's revenue, rising 17.4 percent to $22.4 billion in the quarter, Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat underscored that the company is broadening its business - pointing to growth in hardware, app sales and the cloud business. The company's other revenue, which captures such businesses, climbed 62 percent to $3.4 billion. "We see tremendous potential ahead for these businesses, as well as in the continued development of non-advertising revenue streams for YouTube," Porat said on a call with investors. The results were met with a mixed reaction from Wall Street, which sent shares down 2.2 percent to $838 in extended trade after closing at $856.98 on Nasdaq. Google faced a higher tax rate of 22 percent, compared to 19 percent for the year overall, contributing to the dent in profitability. "If you look above that, it’s business as usual," said analyst James Wang of ARK Investment Management. "There has been no margin compression in the actual business." Executives suggested that they are beginning to reap the rewards of their investment in hardware. Porat spotlighted the company's line of Nest smart home products, saying sales doubled during the key holiday period including Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Google-branded hardware also showed promise as Google Home, a smart speaker, and the Pixel smartphone gained traction over the holidays, Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said during the call. "We’re committed to this for the long term as a great way to bring a beautiful, seamless Google experience to people," he said. The company posted a stronger-than-expected 22.2 percent increase in quarterly revenue as advertisers spent more to reach an expanding user base that spends more time on smartphones and YouTube. Research firm eMarketer has estimated that Google will capture $60.92 billion in search ad revenue this year, or 58.8 percent of the search ad market worldwide. Paid clicks, or clicks on Google ads, rose 36 percent, compared with a 33 percent increase in the third quarter. Paid clicks are those ads on which an advertiser pays only if a user clicks on them. Analysts on average had expected a rise of 26.9 percent, according to FactSet StreetAccount. Cost-per-click dropped 9 percent, a slide that has continued as Google sells more mobile ads, which command lower prices. However, the shift is not necessarily alarming as it suggests Google is selling more ads on YouTube, which are seen as a key growth driver, Rice said. Alphabet's Other Bets revenue increased to $262 million from $150 million a year earlier, while the operating loss of $1.09 billion narrowed from $1.21 billion. Other Bets includes broadband business Google Fiber, home automation products Nest, self-driving technology company Waymo as well as X, the company's research facility that works on "moon shot" ventures. Verily Life Sciences, one such bet, announced Thursday that Singapore-based investment company Temasek had invested $800 million for a minority stake in the company. The investment reflects Alphabet's greater fiscal discipline under Porat and suggests a potential new model for the other bets, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. "Getting external investors involved helps spread that risk out and reduces Google’s exposure," he said. "It also allows some things to move faster than they would if it were just Google's cash backing them." Alphabet's net income rose to $5.33 billion, or $7.56 per Class A and B share and Class C capital stock, in the fourth quarter, from $4.92 billion, or $7.06 per share, a year earlier.

The company's consolidated revenue rose to $26.06 billion above the average estimate of $25.26 billion.

January 26, 2017 | 01:11PM PT Google CEO Sundar Pichai didn’t provide any concrete sales numbers for his company’s new Pixel phones and other recently-introduced hardware devices during Thursday’s earnings call of Google parent Alphabet, only telling analysts  that “the early signs are promising.” That left analysts no other choice than to read the tea leaves, and scour Alphabet’s earnings numbers for any indication on whether the Pixel phone is a success or not. Alphabet booked revenue of $26 billion during the three months ending December 31 2016, compared to $21.3 billion during the same time last year. The company’s adjusted net income for Q4 of 2016 was $5.3 billion, compared to $4.9 billion a year ago. This equals earning per share of $9.36, compared to $8.67 a year ago. Analysts had expected earnings of $9.64 per share after the company delivered a massive beat with its Q3 2016 results. That slight miss sent Alphabet’s stock down in after-hours trading. Google’s ad business is still the biggest money-maker for Alphabet — but this time around, analysts and industry observers paid especially close attention to a different source of revenue: Google generated $3.4 billion with its “other segments” of business, which include not only Play Store and services revenues, but also sales of hardware like the recently-introduced Pixel Phone. Google unveiled the Pixel phone as a contender to Apple’s iPhone last fall, but has said little about the device’s performance since. Pixel phones are currently only available through Verizon, as well as via Google’s own web store. Recent reports indicated that both had trouble keeping up with demand for some of the phone’s models. Google also introduced a range of other hardware devices in recent months, including its own line of Wifi routers, an Amazon Echo competitor called Google Home and its first VR headset. With lower retail prices, these devices likely didn’t have as much of an impact on Google’s overall hardware revenue, but Pichai still suggested that Google will continue to expand its hardware lineup. He didn’t provide many details on initial usage patterns, but said that the company saw a lot of usage during the holidays. “In particular, Google Home was a very popular present,” he said.

Google's Pixel phone shines despite misgauging demand by: MICHAEL LIEDTKE, AP Technology Writer Updated: Jan 26, 2017 - 4:14 PM Twtter SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - The Pixel phone, Google's answer to Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy, is off to a promising start - but might have done even better had Google managed consumer demand as smartly as the device's sleek design. Although Google hasn't released sales figures, industry researchers say the Pixel has been a hot item since its October debut was greeted with mostly glowing reviews and the biggest marketing blitz in Google's 18-year history. But there were missed opportunities. Google didn't have enough Pixels available to meet demand. Rather than wait several weeks, many consumers interested in the Pixel probably bought an iPhone, Galaxy or another phone instead. And these people aren't likely to need a phone replacement for another year or two. Google also struck a deal to sell it through just one wireless carrier, Verizon. Although Google's online store sold Pixels compatible with other wireless networks, most people don't shop for phones that way. Of course, it's a moot point if there weren't enough Pixels to sell, but Google likely would have produced more if it had distribution deals with other carriers. It's not surprising that Google misjudged the market, given that this is the search company's first stab at making its own phone. Previously, it partnered with various manufacturers on a Nexus line of phones to showcase its Android operating system, but that effort barely made a dent. "This was probably a really good learning experience for them," says Neil Doshi, an analyst with Mizhuo Securities USA. The Pixel's success is important to Google because it wants to ensure there's a stylish Android phone to compete with the iPhone and drive more affluent consumers to its search engine, maps, YouTube videos and other services. Samsung's Galaxy and other phones also run on Android, but those devices have been de-emphasizing Google's services. Google, which is based in Mountain View, California, can afford to make some mistakes as it tries to establish the Pixel because its internet search and advertising network brings in so much revenue. Alphabet, Google's corporate parent, provided another reminder of its financial might with Thursday's release of its fourth-quarter earnings. The company earned $5.3 billion on revenue of $26 billion during the final three months of last year. Even after subtracting commissions paid to Google's ad partners, Alphabet's revenue totaled $21 billion - a 23 percent increase from a year earlier. The company's profit rose 8 percent from the prior year. Although Pixel sales weren't disclosed, the numbers provided a clue on how the phone did. Google's "other revenue" segment, which covers all sales outside of advertising, generated $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter, a 62 percent increase from the same time last year. Some of those gains came from sales of Google's new internet-connected speaker, Home, and its business software services, but Doshi believes most of the increase was generated by the Pixel. He estimates Google sold 1 million to 1.5 million Pixels during the fourth quarter. That's still just a sliver of the estimated 77 million that Apple sold during the same period (Apple is scheduled to release its numbers Tuesday). Pixel sales are also well below the roughly 15 million Galaxy S7 that Samsung sold during that device's first quarter on the market. Still, analysts say the Pixel did exceptionally well for a new phone with little brand recognition. "Without question, Google has a hit on its hands and is building a platform for success," says Jeff Moore, principal of Wave7 Research. Wave7 estimates that Pixel accounted for 12 percent of activations in December compared with 51 percent for iPhones and 26 percent for Samsung devices. Localytics, which tracks app activity on nearly 2 billion smartphones, also reported Pixel activations have steadily increased since sales began, especially around the Thanksgiving weekend and the holidays. "It looks like it has the potential to be a strong competitor to the likes of Apple and Samsung," says Josh Todd, Localytics' chief marketing officer. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Josh Miller Phones by Gordon Gottsegen 27 January 2017 6:43 am AEDT Up Next Meet Jon Hamm, the hologram (aka the holohamm) The Google Pixel and Pixel XL were only released this past October, but the rumor mill has already begun churning out details about the follow-up Pixel 2. The next Pixel is rumored to be even better than the highly regarded original, with potential upgrades like water-resistance, an improved camera and a faster processor, 9to5Google reports. And, for Pixel fans on a budget, the high-priced phone could get a cheaper version to go alongside it, the story noted. Right now, 9to5Google's source is referring to it as the "Pixel 2B." What sort of features could the next Pixel bring us? Josh Miller Google did not immediately respond to CNET's request for comment. With Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 recalled in the wake of two major battery fires, Google's Pixel is currently our top Android phone. Google hit it big after ditching the Nexus brand name, and creating its first premium phone to use its name. But it also comes with a premium price that's out of reach to many wallet-watchers. A stronger Pixel 2 could help cement Google's reputation as a world-class phonemaker, while a cheaper addition to its portfolio could help the brand gain headway further downstream. Let's dig a little more into two of the rumors, shall we? Besides dunking your Pixel in the tub, which Google may still be considering, the Pixel 2 could take improved low-light photos. Other details are vague: the camera may not come with greater megapixels, but the phone could allegedly come with other features to make up for it -- that could mean filters or shooting modes. It's still very early, but Google is believed to also be testing out a few new processors for the Pixel 2, from Qualcomm, Intel and possibly Taiwanese chipset manufacturer MediaTek. These improvements could mean that the phone won't come cheap. Added features and improved hardware could run the price up at least another $50/£40/AU$66, the source says. The Pixel and Pixel XL are already expensive phones to make, and can cost buyers a pretty penny if they opt for more storage or bigger sizes. That's where the cheaper Pixel, or "Pixel 2B," could come in as an alternative. Pixel XL vs. iPhone 7 Plus: Battle of the cameras Does Google's new Pixel phone really have the best camera ever put in a smartphone? We tested it against Apple's dual-lens iPhone 7 Plus to find out. by Vanessa Hand Orellana 2:41 Close Drag Personally, it's hard to imagine a smartphone for the mainstream market getting even pricier than the Pixel and Pixel XL. Companies usually keep phones roughly the same price year after year, and sell the previous year's models at a discount. There's a long way to go before we expect Google to add to its Pixel family, so we could see the rumors change as more leaks surface about Google's developing Pixel plans.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Allo gets “Lucky” as a new chat bot By Rei Padla - January 26, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Are you only Allo already? If not, you may consider downloading it today because you will get “lucky” with Lucky. It’s a new chat bot that can reply to you with gifs and other funny stuff. If you’re familiar with Giphy support on Slack, this is similar. Google is famous for the “I’m feeling Lucky” treat and it has recently arrived on Allo. Google has been making Allo more special and interesting perhaps to attract more users to download. Recently, Star Wars Rogue One stickers were added. Support for Brazilian Portuguese and Hindi for Google Assistant was also included. If you may remember, Buzzfeed also released special Thanksgiving stickers for Allo. Of course, we can’t forget the Fantastic Beasts and Stranger Things goodies. We’re not sure if those things added to Allo helped Google gain more people to use the chat app but we know there are already those enjoying it with Pushbullet integration, split-screen support, and direct reply from notifications.

The company's costs also ticked higher, as it invested in talent and the core business. Revenue topped expectations, led by YouTube and mobile search, chief financial officer Ruth Porat said in a statement. But a Google representative told CNBC that YouTube has been slower to pick up the slack from Google's other advertising properties. The company posted fourth-quarter earnings per share of $9.36, adjusted and excluding items, on revenues of $26.06 billion. Analysts expect Google-parent Alphabet to report earnings of about $9.64 per Class A share on $25.26 billion in revenue, according to a consensus estimate from Thomson Reuters. Shares fell about 3 percent in after-hours trading. Getty Images Google CEO Sundar Pichai Cost of revenues rose from a year ago to 41 percent of revenues, up from 38 percent a year ago. The company's traffic aquisition costs hit $4.8 billion during the quarter, up from a year ago and higher than the $4.7 billion expected by a StreetAccount estimate. Alphabet also reporting a tax-charge related to stock-based compensation of $586 million, higher than the $316 million a year ago. Google's costs-per-click — the amount it gets from advertisers— fell 16 percent year over year, more than the 11 percent expected by StreetAccount estimates. "The core of Alphabet's business is still about both Google's search and YouTube's revenues," Forrester analyst Thomas Husson told CNBC in a statement. "The majority of these revenues derive from mobile, and the lower cost-per-click here should be compensated by a higher volume. I'd argue that the stability of Google's revenue in the next two to three years will depend on their ability to maintain the growth of mobile revenues. While there might be slower growth, the mid-term prospect looks good given the fact that advertisers will wake up to the mobile Web opportunity after having focused too much on mobile apps." The results hinge on Google's new advertising formats, like promoted pins in Maps, and progress monetizing YouTube. Investors will listen closely to the quarterly conference call for any signs that YouTube, like rival Facebook, is closing in on the maximum number of ads its customers will tolerate. Google did not share specifics on the holiday season sales of the new Pixel phone and Google Home, its competitor to Amazon's Echo. Neil Doshi, managing director at Mizuho Securities, estimated that Google sold about 1 million Pixels during the quarter. CEO Sundar Pichai told investors that the company was thrilled with the reception of the Pixel, and that the Google Home was a very popular present for the holidays. Earnings are also a chance for chief financial officer Ruth Porat to share progress on reigning in the company's "other bets" category, which includes Nest home automation products, venture investments and self-driving car technology (recently renamed Waymo). The company reported "other bets" revenue of $262 million for the fourth quarter, much higher than the $150 million in the year ago period. The operating loss also narrowed from a year ago: In the fourth quarter, it was a loss of $1.088 billion, compared to a loss of $1.213 billion a year ago. Porat said that Waymo is ontinuing to drive down hardware costs, while sales of Nest's key products more than doubled over the two weeks including Black Friday and Cyber Monday, Porat said. Wall Street has lauded the financial discipline, transparency and shareholder return of the Alphabet structure, even if the company has lost key staffers in the process. Shares of Alphabet hit an all-time intra-day high of $861 a share on Thursday, as the broader markets hit record levels. — CNBC's Deirdre Bosa contributed to this report. show chapters Garrity on Google: Potential area of growth surrounding driverless vehicles    Thursday, 26 Jan 2017 | 5:09 PM ET | 04:31 Anita BalakrishnanNews Associate Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change GOOGL --- Binge 'Walking Dead' a megahit, thanks in part to white-knuckled binge-watchers By: Marc Gilbert, senior producer, CNBC Walking Dead producer: The phenomenon is no accident    Walking Dead producer: The show isn’t about zombies    Terminator writer sounds alarm on AI    Walking Dead producer: VR makes me nauseous    To view this site, you need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser, and either the Flash Plugin or an HTML5-Video enabled browser.

Credit: Martyn Williams More like this Tweaking WSH helps defend Windows PCs from malicious email attachments Ransomware became one of the top threats to enterprises this year Blocking JavaScript can stop some Windows malware Video IT security: 3 things you need to know now Starting Feb. 13, Google will no longer allow JavaScript attachments on its Gmail service, killing one of the main methods of malware distribution over the past two years. Users will no longer be able to attach .JS files to emails in Gmail, regardless of whether they attach them directly or they include them in archives like .gz, .bz2, .zip or .tgz. For those rare cases when such files need to be shared via email, users can upload them to a storage service like Google Drive and then share the link. The .JS file extension will be added an existing list of other banned file attachments that includes: .ADE, .ADP, .BAT, .CHM, .CMD, .COM, .CPL, .EXE, .HTA, .INS, .ISP, .JAR, .JSE, .LIB, .LNK, .MDE, .MSC, .MSP, .MST, .PIF, .SCR, .SCT, .SHB, .SYS, .VB, .VBE, .VBS, .VXD, .WSC, .WSF and .WSH. Most of these file types have long been abused by cybercriminals to send malware via email. The same thing has happened with .JS over the past two years, especially since JavaScript files can be executed directly on Windows thanks to a system component called the Windows Script Host (WSH). The JavaScript files, which are typically obfuscated, can serve as downloaders for other malware and have been especially preferred by ransomware pushers. Widespread threats like TeslaCrypt and Locky have used this method of distribution and one particular ransomware program dubbed RAA was written completely in JavaScript. "Be wary of emails with JavaScript attachments," researchers with Microsoft's Malware Protection Center warned in a blog post in April. "It is uncommon and quite suspicious for people to send legitimate applications in pure JavaScript file format (files with .js or .jse extension) via email. Do not click or open it." Other scripting files like .VBS (VBScript), .VBE (VBScript Encoded), .WSH (Windows Script Host Settings File) and .WSF (Windows Script File) -- all of which Gmail already blocks -- can be used in a similar way. The general rule is that if you don't recognize a file type and don't know what it does, you should never open it. If you are expecting files in unusual formats, you should always double check the source before opening them and it would be best not to share them via email.

A new report today claims to shed some light on Google's next smartphones, but it is apparently based off of just one source, so have your grain of salt nearby for this one. Although we'll be referring to just one Pixel 2 device, we assume that Google will once again launch two, in two different sizes. The Pixel 2 is said to come with an even better camera than the original, with Google reportedly putting an emphasis on great low-light photography. The snapper won't have a lot of megapixels, but will "compensate in extra features", whatever that may mean. The original Pixel's camera has been a selling point for Google, so it's unsurprising that it would want to keep the crown when the next generation comes along. Water-resistance for the Pixel 2 is "still on the table", which makes it sound like Google isn't 100% sure about including this feature. Though given how basically every single big flagship device this year will be able to boast that, it would be pretty foolish for the search giant to omit it again. Original Google Pixel from 2016 As you'd expect, at this stage multiple Pixel 2 prototypes are being evaluated, and they feature multiple chipsets. One of those is unsurprisingly a Snapdragon 83x, but another allegedly comes from Intel, and there's also a custom chipset developed by Google in testing. It's unclear which of the SoCs will make the cut, and there's still plenty of time for such preliminary testing since we're many months away from the Pixel 2's assumed fall release. If you were one of the people who complained about the original Pixel matching the iPhone in price, you're definitely not going to like what Google's doing with its successor. Today's report says you should expect at least a $50 price hike compared to last year's model. Interestingly, Google is thinking of alleviating the concerns of budget-conscious buyers by possibly launching a different handset, codenamed Pixel 2B, which will be "significantly cheaper" than the flagship device. Obviously this should come with lesser specs, and it's going to be "aimed at different markets". Wondering what that means? Well, the company's goal is said to be bringing the "Google experience and the Google Phone to emerging markets", so there you have it. Perhaps the Pixel 2 will be confined to some developed markets like its predecessor, while the cheaper Pixel 2B will make it to emerging markets only. There are currently a few prototypes of this smartphone in testing too, and if everything goes well (and Google doesn't change its mind about launching the lower-end model) it should arrive around the same time as the Pixel 2 or shortly after that.

The allegations raised in a lawsuit filed Thursday in California state court in Santa Clara are sure to rock the nascent self-driving car industry that is racing to put automated vehicles on the roadways in the next few years. Tesla’s lawsuit accuses Sterling Anderson of violating his employment contract with the company by trying to recruit at least a dozen engineers and taking “hundreds of gigabytes” of confidential and proprietary information for the benefit of a company he allegedly founded while still at Tesla TSLA, +0.17% Anderson oversaw the team developing the semiautonomous Autopilot system from November 2015 until this month. The auto maker also accuses Anderson’s business partner, Chris Urmson, of helping to recruit Tesla workers for their new startup called Aurora. Urmson is the former chief technology officer of Alphabet Inc.’s GOOGL, -1.39%  Google self-driving effort, now called Waymo. “Tesla cannot sit idly by when an employee like Anderson abuses his position of trust and orchestrates a scheme to deliberately and repeatedly violate his non-solicit agreement, hide evidence, and take the company’s confidential and proprietary information for use in a competing venture,” Tesla said in the lawsuit.

Google Maps: Here's How Likely You Are to Find Parking Space GO Google uses data stored by users on its servers Jan 26, 2017 20:41 GMT  ·  By Gabriela Vatu  ·  Share:  Google Maps is upping the game, and it’s trying to not only get you to your destination in record time but also to tell you how hard finding a parking spot is going to be. The chances are that if you’re going to a location you’ve visited before, you already know what to expect when it comes to parking spaces. But if you’re going to a new place, you’re going to need a little warning. Rolling out for San Francisco, Miami, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, San Diego, Tampa, Cleveland, Denver, Phoenix, Sacramento, Seattle, Minneapolis, Charlotte, Detroit, Atlanta, Orlando, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, Dallas, Washington, Houston and Portland, the new historical parking data will surely come in handy. How does it work? So how does Google do it? Unfortunately, it can’t tell you in real time how busy the parking lots in the area will be, but it can tell you how things have been there historically. Once you type in the address you’re going to, Google Maps will pull up a parking difficulty icon on the directions card. Ranked from limited to medium to easy, you’re at least getting a warning to know how to handle parking in that general area. For instance, if Google Maps tells you there’s limited parking space, you might want to consider checking out a different street, or even parking on a different block and walking a bit just so you don’t spend an hour driving in circles, praying someone’s going to move their car. The parking function on Google Maps compiles data from users that store location information on Google’s servers, much like it does with many of its other services. Before you get all upset about how Google uses your data, remember you probably signed up for it without even knowing because nobody reads those Terms. This whole idea sounds great, and there’s a lot of hoping that it will reach more US cities and even cross borders and Oceans to reach the less fortunate Europeans who always seem to be the last to get the updates. #Google#Google Maps#parking space#update subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news DuckDuckGo Finally Hits 10 Billion Searches Net Neutrality Uncertainty Worries IT Professionals, Study Shows Google I/O Date and Location Revealed Through Puzzles Google Creates Two New Chromebooks for Students Windows 10 Mobile Start Screen vs. iOS Home Screen: Beauty and the Beast Let’s Chat: With or Without an Antivirus in Windows 10?

According to Jaron Lanier, information is more important than physical labor. Data is what allowed Google to launch Google Flight and become a dominant player in the Online Travel Agency market, overnight and without any prior experience in Travel. Data can literally make or break new business models. Data even gets presidents elected nowadays. Data comes with a cacophony of buzzwords and tech concepts that can seem both convincing and confusing: big data, data warehouse, machine learning, RMDBs, cloud, meta-data, dark data. But at its core, data is just information. It is stored in various databases and is structured. It can then be accessed… or lost forever. Some have value, some are worthless. Hoteliers and Data Hotel managers are not technology people and are perhaps less primed to be data aware. They are already painfully aware that their industry could be further disrupted by the likes of Airbnb and other big data players. In most cases, they have never accessed their data. Hotel IT infrastructures are outdated and error-prone. They tend to rely on various legacy systems and databases that do not communicate with each other. The data this ecosystem produces tends to be unstructured. Any attempt at plugging an off-the-shelf BI tool would be futile without a large data warehouse upstream. Hotels Generate Data, Lots of Data At Boost-inn we sell software solutions to chains of hotels so we see a lot of hotels of different sizes with different operations, needs or even business models. However, all generate data. The first time we plugged to an average-sized chain of hotels, we had a bit of a revelation. A small chain of 12 regional hotels in France generated data on more than 50,000 reservations per year. This small chain had data on 50,000 credit card holders per year. Compared to a large online retail platform this may seem insignificant but hotels are not online retailers; they are traditional service providers with physical assets and as such rely on foot traffic. Foot Traffic With a Digital Footprint 50,000 people made reservations with their credit card over a 12-month period. These people traveled alone, as couples, as families, on vacation or on business. They ate at the hotels’ restaurants or preferred to go out, they made Spa reservations, booked additional concierge services, went to the bar etc. It is a fact that hotels have lost control of the online booking battle. To some extent they have surrendered the online customer interface to third party providers (OTAs). However, hotels have a marked advantage. It takes second to book a hotel online but guests typically spend anything between 12 hours and a few days on the premises. Data Helps Hoteliers Sell Rooms and Experiences As always with data, the fun part starts when users can visualize it intuitively using hotel dashboards. Revenue or Yield Managers are responsible for setting prices and achieving the best possible profit margins based on occupation rates and variety of other fluctuating factors. They need live, accurate and wide-ranging data to make predictions and sell the most rooms and the best possible price. Data impacts the RevPar (Revenue Per Available Rooms); one of the key metrics for hoteliers. Marketing officers armed with accurate data can launch marketing strategies that turn bookers into repeat business and impacts direct bookings. We have seen hotels make gains of up to 20% in direct bookings purely on the back of data. Reservation Agents who are often the first point of contacts to guests can also use data to their advantage to create tailor-made experiences in the fly for their guests. Our clients claim this has led to an increase of between 20-30% of their positive reviews. In this case data affects the hotels e-reputation. We are at a turning point where hoteliers are increasingly seeing the direct and practical benefits of mastering their data. As they become more data fluent, hoteliers realize they can compete with OTA’s and players like Airbnb. They need not be disrupted so long as they adapt and innovate. This article was written by Bahadour Moussa, Chief Evnagelist at Boost-Inn, and discusses ways traditional hotels can smartly leverage data to compete with tech giants like AirBNB.

Recode revealed in early September that Urmson was working on his own self-driving car company. The complaint, filed in California Superior Court, County of Santa Clara, alleges that Anderson attempted to recruit at least 12 Tesla engineers to a new self-driving venture that he and Urmson were starting, in violation of Anderson’s non-solicitation agreement, and that Anderson took confidential Tesla information and “destroy[ed] evidence in an effort to cover his tracks.” Aurora denied all the allegations in a statement. Tesla is alleging that Urmson and Aurora Innovation “knew of” and “intended to cause Anderson to breach his agreements with Tesla,” as well as to “[interfere] with prospective economic advantage” between Tesla and its employees. Tesla alleges that Anderson transferred hundreds of gigabytes of “Tesla confidential and proprietary information” to his personal hard drives, and failed to return that information when he left the company, in violation of his contract. It also says he altered the timestamps on files on his company-issued laptop and erased others, “all in an attempt to conceal his misdeeds.” erased files “in an attempt to conceal his misdeeds” It says that Anderson and Urmson worked together while Anderson was “on Tesla time, using his Tesla company laptop, and on Tesla’s premises,” including a time when Anderson took his Tesla laptop to Urmson’s home and accessed a document called “Recruiting targets.” Tesla says Anderson had a non-solicitation contract with the company that extended 12 months beyond his last day of work. In the complaint, Tesla says it “does not file this action lightly” and says that the company is “typically supportive” of the personal ambitions of its employees, but “cannot sit idly by” when an employee “abuses his position of trust and orchestrates a scheme to deliberately and repeatedly violate his non-solicit agreement, hide evidence, and take the company’s confidential and proprietary information for use in a competing venture.” only two employees ended up leaving Tesla Out of the dozen employees that Tesla says Anderson tried to poach, only two ended up leaving the company, according to the filing. It goes on to claim Anderson told Tesla he was leaving the company in early December, but didn’t mention the new venture. He stayed at the company for several weeks, agreeing with Tesla that he would see the next Autopilot upgrade through to release. On January 3rd, the complaint says, three engineers from the Autopilot group told Tesla that they would be joining Aurora (one later changed his mind), and Anderson allegedly began covering his tracks, erasing his phone and some files (including some Aurora-related documents) from his company-issued laptop. The complaint alleges that Anderson did not hand over hard drives he used to back up his company laptop when his employment with the company ended on January 4th. The lawsuit also sheds some light on Urmson’s new venture, Aurora Innovation. It says Anderson said to a Tesla engineer that the “scope of hardware development” at Aurora would be “more expansive” than they might expect and that the company had already taken meetings with “four of the top five OEMs.” The lawsuit asks for a jury trial to determine compensatory damages, as well as auditing of Aurora’s systems for “unlawful retention or use” of Tesla’s information. Tesla directed us to the lawsuit filing when asked for comment. Sterling Anderson sent The Verge this statement from Aurora Innovation: Tesla’s meritless lawsuit reveals both a startling paranoia and an unhealthy fear of competition. This abuse of the legal system is a malicious attempt to stifle a competitor and destroy personal reputations. Aurora looks forward to disproving these false allegations in court and to building a successful self-driving business. Tesla’s complaint, filed today, is embedded below.

Users will no longer be able to attach .JS files to emails in Gmail, regardless of whether they attach them directly or they include them in archives like .gz, .bz2, .zip or .tgz. For those rare cases when such files need to be shared via email, users can upload them to a storage service like Google Drive and then share the link. The .JS file extension will be added an existing list of other banned file attachments that includes: .ADE, .ADP, .BAT, .CHM, .CMD, .COM, .CPL, .EXE, .HTA, .INS, .ISP, .JAR, .JSE, .LIB, .LNK, .MDE, .MSC, .MSP, .MST, .PIF, .SCR, .SCT, .SHB, .SYS, .VB, .VBE, .VBS, .VXD, .WSC, .WSF and .WSH. Most of these file types have long been abused by cybercriminals to send malware via email. The same thing has happened with .JS over the past two years, especially since JavaScript files can be executed directly on Windows thanks to a system component called the Windows Script Host (WSH). The JavaScript files, which are typically obfuscated, can serve as downloaders for other malware and have been especially preferred by ransomware pushers. Widespread threats like TeslaCrypt and Locky have used this method of distribution and one particular ransomware program dubbed RAA was written completely in JavaScript. "Be wary of emails with JavaScript attachments," researchers with Microsoft's Malware Protection Center warned in a blog post in April. "It is uncommon and quite suspicious for people to send legitimate applications in pure JavaScript file format (files with .js or .jse extension) via email. Do not click or open it." Other scripting files like .VBS (VBScript), .VBE (VBScript Encoded), .WSH (Windows Script Host Settings File) and .WSF (Windows Script File) -- all of which Gmail already blocks -- can be used in a similar way. The general rule is that if you don't recognize a file type and don't know what it does, you should never open it. If you are expecting files in unusual formats, you should always double check the source before opening them and it would be best not to share them via email.

Google on Wednesday revealed that it took down 1.7 billion "bad ads" in 2016, more than double the amount it removed the year before. Around 112 million were so-called "trick to click" ads, which "often appear as system warnings to deceive users into clicking on them, not realizing they are often downloading harmful software or malware," Google's Director of Product Management for sustainable ads, Scott Spencer, wrote in a blog post. Google took down six times more "trick to click" ads last year than it did in 2015. Nearly 80 million of the ads Google took down in 2016 were removed for being "deceiving, misleading, and shocking users." Examples of these include ads asking "'Are you at risk for this rare, skin-eating disease?' or offering miracle cures like a pill that will help you lose 50 pounds in three days without lifting a finger," Spencer wrote. Meanwhile, bad ads for pharmaceuticals shot up last year: Google removed more than 68 million ads for "healthcare violations" in 2016, up from 12.5 million the year before. The company also took down more than 17 million bad ads for illegal gambling violations. "A free and open web is a vital resource for people and businesses around the world. And ads play a key role in ensuring you have access to accurate, quality information online," Spencer wrote. "But bad ads can ruin the online experience for everyone. They promote illegal products and unrealistic offers. They can trick people into sharing personal information and infect devices with harmful software. Ultimately, bad ads pose a threat to users, Google's partners, and the sustainability of the open web itself." Google also in 2016 removed: nearly 7 million ads for intentionally attempting to trick its detection systems; 5 million payday loan ads, which "often result in unaffordable payments and high default rates for users;" 900,000 ads that contained malware; and more than 23,000 "self-clicking" mobile ads, which just appear on your phone and download an app you didn't want, Spencer wrote. Google in 2016 also discovered a new type of scammer its calling "tabloid cloakers," who try to game the system by pretending to offer news content. Related Yahoo Squashes Ads Infected by Malware Yahoo Squashes Ads Infected by Malware "Cloakers often take advantage of timely topics—a government election, a trending news story or a popular celebrity—and their ads can look like headlines on a news website," Spencer wrote. "But when people click on that story about Ellen DeGeneres and aliens, they go to a site selling weight-loss products, not a news story." The company suspended more than 1,300 accounts for doing this. Spencer explained that Google also often suspends websites and accounts associated with bad ads. The company last year disabled 8,000 sites promoting payday loans, plus 6,000 sites and 6,000 accounts attempting to advertise counterfeit goods. Google also "took action" against 47,000 sites "for promoting content and products related to weight-loss scams" and 15,000 sites for unwanted software.

Sci-Tech by Eric Mack January 26, 2017 11:56 AM PST @ericcmack Up Next Meet Jon Hamm, the hologram (aka the holohamm) Enlarge Image A new algorithm can visually discern malignant skin lesions from less dangerous ones. Stanford/Matt Young Artificial intelligence that diagnoses skin cancer as well as a dermatologist could one day rest in the palm of your hand. A team from the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory set up a machine-learning AI to teach itself to diagnose cancer by looking at skin lesions just as a doctor would during an exam. The team tested the algorithm against 21 board-certified dermatologists, and it performed just as well as its human counterparts. "We realized it was feasible, not just to do something well, but as well as a human dermatologist," Sebastian Thrun, an adjunct professor in the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, said in a statement. "That's when our thinking changed. That's when we said, 'Look, this is not just a class project for students, this is an opportunity to do something great for humanity.'" Thrun is perhaps better known as one of the founders of both Udacity and Google X. A paper on the system co-authored by him and his colleagues appeared in the journal Nature Wednesday. 17 How Hollywood sees AI, in 16 films The researchers envision making the algorithm compatible with smartphones, putting skin cancer diagnosis into the hands of just about anyone anywhere. "Early detection is critical, as the estimated five-year survival rate for melanoma drops from over 99 percent if detected in its earliest stages to about 14 percent if detected in its latest stages," the paper reads. "We developed a computational method which may allow medical practitioners and patients to proactively track skin lesions and detect cancer earlier." The AI is a convolutional neural network, the same type of system Google uses to wallop masters of the ancient game Go. The researchers used one of Google's AI systems -- the GoogleNet Inception v3 CNN architecture, which had already been taught to visually identify different objects. But it hadn't yet been trained to tell the difference between a malignant carcinoma and a harmless skin lesion, so the team pulled together a dataset to transform the neural network into a digital dermatologist. 'Farsighted' looks on the technological bright side of 2016 (Farsighted, Ep 3) Not everyone loved 2016, but we could look back on it as the year we made real progress toward living longer, better and perhaps even on Mars. by Eric Mack 51:04 Close Drag More from the future Dr. Google may check your eyes in the future Artificial intelligence has a big year ahead 2016 wasn't so bad: 5 ways this year will shape the future "There's no huge dataset of skin cancer that we can just train our algorithms on, so we had to make our own," said Brett Kuprel, co-lead author of the paper and a graduate student in the Thrun lab. "We gathered images from the internet and worked with the medical school to create a nice taxonomy out of data that was very messy -- the labels alone were in several languages, including German, Arabic and Latin." The coders collaborated with dermatologists and others in the medical field on the project. "Advances in computer-aided classification of benign versus malignant skin lesions could greatly assist dermatologists in improved diagnosis for challenging lesions and provide better management options for patients," said Susan Swetter, professor of dermatology and co-author of the paper. "However, rigorous prospective validation of the algorithm is necessary before it can be implemented in clinical practice, by practitioners and patients alike." Last year, Google announced that it trained an algorithm to spot diabetic retinopathy, which can cause blindness. Fortunately, while we wait for these sort of "doctor's helpers" forms of A.I. to hit hospitals and clinics, we can bide our time by letting the same sorts of systems kick our butts at Go and all sort of other games.

If that wasn’t impressive enough, DuckDuckGo has also enjoyed its biggest day ever, completing 14 million searches in one 24-hour period. And yet most people have still never heard of DuckDuckGo… DuckDuckGo isn’t yet a household name, but it has actually been around since 2008. In the big scheme of things, especially when compared to Google, DuckDuckGo is still the underdog. Or perhaps the underduck. However, DuckDuckGo has grown steadily over the last nine years without gaining much attention. For the uninitiated, DuckDuckGo is a search engine 8 Search Tricks That Work on DuckDuckGo but Not on Google 8 Search Tricks That Work on DuckDuckGo but Not on Google Google Search is king.

DuckDuckGo will search the web for you while protecting your privacy. It promises not to track you, or share any identifiable information about you with third parties.

It enjoyed a noticeable increase in its number of users when Edward Snowden revealed how the NSA is tracking everybody Your Interest in Privacy Will Ensure You're Targeted By The NSA Your Interest in Privacy Will Ensure You're Targeted By The NSA Read More . And it’s enjoying another noticeable increase as we speak for obvious reasons. In a celebratory blog post, DuckDuckGo CEO and Founder Gabriel Weinberg has announced that the search engine has now completed 10 billion searches. An impressive 4 billion of those took place in 2016. And on January 10, 2017, DuckDuckGo completed 14 million searches in one day. This is mightily impressive. However, to put it in context, according to The Verge, Google completes around 40,000 searches every second, which equates to 3.5 billion searches every day. So in just three days Google completes the same number of searches as DuckDuckGo has managed in its lifetime. The World’s Most Trusted Search Engine? DuckDuckGo is unlikely to ever be the most popular search engine in the world, but it continues to grow at a steady pace. And for a website that’s on a mission to be “the world’s most trusted search engine,” perhaps being popular isn’t considered the true measure of success Why This Longtime Google Fan Now Prefers DuckDuckGo Why This Longtime Google Fan Now Prefers DuckDuckGo Most of us don't remember life before Google search.

Won't ever go back to Google. Reply Thomas January 26, 2017 at 11:24 pm I use DuckDuckGo for a couple reasons. I like trying different things so I made DuckDuckGo my default search engine many months ago. Since then it has been serving up content that I find useful so I continue to use it. As I often need to find information that is work related and may not be specifically related to my personal interests I find it is a good option to have rather than always relying on Google which constantly thinks it knows me. Reply EMS January 26, 2017 at 11:20 pm I've been using duckduckgo for 7-8 years and I LOVE IT. I also respect DuckDuckGo for keepig its word after all these years. Searches are great and none of that advertising if you don't want it. PLUS It's my first choice. When I have a project or desire to gather as much info as possible on something, I supplement with a Google search and NEVER click on one of the first "paid for" deceptive listings that come up....ESPECIALLY if "Ask" is even hinted at. I think Bing is "left in the dust" the majority of time, and I also believe I've given it a fair shot periodically since MS tried to "force" it on me through their OS upgrades. I have stopped using any other search engines. DuckDuckGo, then Google for back-up or comparison. NO need for anything else. Reply decafjava January 27, 2017 at 9:04 am Absolutley I am a big fan and in any case I still use Google by using DDG's bang feature.

Google Pixel 2 to Pack Improved Camera and CPU, Cheaper Model Also Coming GO The high-end version will cost more than the current one Jan 26, 2017 20:06 GMT  ·  By Andrei Vlad  ·  Share:  It comes as no surprise that Google's next flagship smartphone will be a consistent upgrade over the current model. Obviously, we don't know whether or not it will be called Pixel 2, but we do know a couple of things that Google hasn't yet announced (nor confirmed). We've reported earlier today that the Pixel 2 is likely to feature a waterproof design, but new information has just emerged that points out to even more changes Google plans to make. A new report coming from 9to5Google claims Google, once again, will focus on the camera. The Pixel XL has one of the best cameras on a smartphone, but Google wants to go beyond that by making major improvements to the low light photography features. In addition, sources familiar with Google's plans say the Mountain View company won't be increasing the number of megapixels in the camera, instead it will focus on “extra features.” Hardware-wise, Google is now collaborating with two chipset makers, testing various prototypes. At some point, MediaTek was among Google's partners, but it is said that it's no longer going to lend its chipset to the Pixel phones. Due to the improved chipset, the price of the Pixel 2 will be slightly higher than the current model. Sources say the upcoming flagship will cost around $50 more than the Pixel smartphone. The cheaper Pixel phone could replace Android One program? Nevertheless, Google has a second Pixel 2 smartphone in the works with lower specs, which will probably be launched alongside the flagship. This budget variant is referred to as Pixel 2B and will be “aimed at different markets.” The reason Google will launch a much cheaper Pixel phone this year is to expand its audience and offer “Google experience and Google Phone to emerging markets,” something that it is now trying to do with the Android One program. The budget-friendly Pixel 2 smartphone will be significantly cheaper than the regular model, but Google hasn't yet decided whether it will bring it to the market or not. One last piece of information provided by the source is the fact that Google has already developed “a custom chipset for a test device,” but it isn't decided if it will be packed inside the Pixel 2 since “multiple test devices with different chipsets are being used now.” #Google Pixel#Pixel 2#Google smartphone#Google flagship#Google phone subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Pixel and Pixel XL Successors Will Likely Be Waterproof Samsung to Work with Google on Advancing Artificial Intelligence Google's Android Wear 2.0 Smartwatches Leaked in Low-Res Renders LG Partners with Google and Amazon to Feature AI on the G6 and Other Devices Windows 10 Mobile Start Screen vs. iOS Home Screen: Beauty and the Beast Let’s Chat: With or Without an Antivirus in Windows 10?

Josh Miller Phones by Gordon Gottsegen January 26, 2017 11:43 AM PST Up Next Meet Jon Hamm, the hologram (aka the holohamm) The Google Pixel and Pixel XL were only released this past October, but the rumor mill has already begun churning out details about the follow-up Pixel 2. The next Pixel is rumored to be even better than the highly regarded original, with potential upgrades like water-resistance, an improved camera and a faster processor, 9to5Google reports. And, for Pixel fans on a budget, the high-priced phone could get a cheaper version to go alongside it, the story noted. Right now, 9to5Google's source is referring to it as the "Pixel 2B." What sort of features could the next Pixel bring us? Josh Miller Google did not immediately respond to CNET's request for comment. With Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 recalled in the wake of two major battery fires, Google's Pixel is currently our top Android phone. Google hit it big after ditching the Nexus brand name, and creating its first premium phone to use its name. But it also comes with a premium price that's out of reach to many wallet-watchers. A stronger Pixel 2 could help cement Google's reputation as a world-class phonemaker, while a cheaper addition to its portfolio could help the brand gain headway further downstream. Let's dig a little more into two of the rumors, shall we? Besides dunking your Pixel in the tub, which Google may still be considering, the Pixel 2 could take improved low-light photos. Other details are vague: the camera may not come with greater megapixels, but the phone could allegedly come with other features to make up for it -- that could mean filters or shooting modes. It's still very early, but Google is believed to also be testing out a few new processors for the Pixel 2, from Qualcomm, Intel and possibly Taiwanese chipset manufacturer MediaTek. These improvements could mean that the phone won't come cheap. Added features and improved hardware could run the price up at least another $50/£40/AU$66, the source says. The Pixel and Pixel XL are already expensive phones to make, and can cost buyers a pretty penny if they opt for more storage or bigger sizes. That's where the cheaper Pixel, or "Pixel 2B," could come in as an alternative. Pixel XL vs. iPhone 7 Plus: Battle of the cameras Does Google's new Pixel phone really have the best camera ever put in a smartphone? We tested it against Apple's dual-lens iPhone 7 Plus to find out. by Vanessa Hand Orellana 2:41 Close Drag Personally, it's hard to imagine a smartphone for the mainstream market getting even pricier than the Pixel and Pixel XL. Companies usually keep phones roughly the same price year after year, and sell the previous year's models at a discount. There's a long way to go before we expect Google to add to its Pixel family, so we could see the rumors change as more leaks surface about Google's developing Pixel plans.

Google Pixel 2 will "definitely" come with waterproofing technology, 9to5Google's Stephen Hall said in a tweet on Jan. 25.

Credit: Tom's Guide Hall added that the source, who wasn't identified in the report, told him that Google decided against offering waterproofing in the first model because of a "time constraint." He went on to say that Google was having trouble getting the hardware waterproof in time and for the right price. The news comes as rumors are running rampant in the smartphone industry. Samsung's Galaxy S8 and LG G6 are both expected to find their way to store shelves in the coming months, and have been the subject of countless reports. MORE: Google Pixel vs. iPhone 7 vs. Galaxy S7: Which Flagship is Best? However, the Google Pixel 2 has been largely forgotten amid that talk. The Google Pixel, after all, just reached store shelves in the fall, and it's unlikely that a new handset from the company will be announced for several months. Still, the Google Pixel has proven popular in the Android ecosystem. The Pixel and its larger counterpart, the Pixel XL, are the first handsets fully designed and engineered by Google. Previously, the company offered Nexus handsets under its brand that were designed and engineered by smartphone partners. The Google Pixel line is Google's answer to Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy S devices, offering big screens, ample power, and high-end cameras. And while debate rages over how well they'll sell as time goes on and they face more competition, they're clearly designed to be flagship handsets for anyone who wants a top-notch Android experience. Looking ahead, the Google Pixel 2 will need to face off with powerful competitors, including the iPhone 8, which could make an appearance before the Pixel 2 this fall. According to rumors, the iPhone 8 could come with an all-new all-glass design, curved screen, and smarter Siri. Expect to hear much more about the Pixel 2 in the coming months as rumors continue to surface.

Peter Power/ Reuters/ File | Caption Fullscreen Loading... Patrick Reilly Staff | @PatrickfReilly January 26, 2017 —Amid rising concerns about unsavory online behavior, Google is assuring users it’s working to keep them safe. In a blog post published Wednesday, Scott Spencer, director of product management for the internet search giant, touted the company’s progress in controlling "bad ads," which peddle sketchy products and target internet users’ computer systems and personal information. "In 2016, we took down 1.7 billion ads that violated our advertising policies, more than double the amount of bad ads we took down in 2015," Mr. Spencer wrote. These included ads making illegal, dishonest, or predatory offers, "tabloid cloakers" that pose as news websites but link to sales pages, and "self-clicking ads" that can cause automatic software downloads. Spencer also pointed out that the company had banned ads for payday loans. Internet firms have faced increased pressure to block nefarious online actors in recent months. But much of this scrutiny is focused on "fake news" websites rather than the broader category of "bad ads." While the crackdown on "bad ads" does not mention targeting fake news sites, in particular, Google did implement new rules last fall to prohibit "misrepresentative content." Brian Wieser, a media industry analyst at Pivotal Research, told Wired on Wednesday that fake news constitutes a relatively new "brand un-safe environment" for advertisers, who are wary of trumpeting their brands alongside disreputable content. "It falls under the ad quality issue rather than the bad ads issue," he noted. Given that 90 percent of Google's revenue comes from ad placement, the company has a clear incentive to fight bad ads, as Wired points out, to persuade advertisers and customers to keep coming back. What Google's investments reveal about the company and the future According to the Wall Street Journal’s Jack Nicas, there’s less of an incentive to crack down on distasteful or misleading pages than on ads themselves, since ad-tech firms make money each time the ad appears. "Google, the biggest player in digital advertising, said it would stop placing ads on sites with 'deceptive or misrepresentative' content," Mr. Nicas reported in December. "But so far, enforcement appears spotty: Many Google-placed ads, including those for big brands, continue to appear on the sites, even including ads for Google’s new Pixel smartphones." Google’s current AdSense policy states that it will not place ads on any web page that "advocates against an individual, group, or organization," or features "misrepresentative content."

Sign-Up × After reports that sites espousing racist views were popping up among Google's top results, the company recently changed its search algorithms to prioritize websites with high-quality information and bump down sites that host hate speech. Google users had previously filed complaints about sites like Stormfront, a white supremacist group, and auto-fill queries like "Are Jews evil?" Google has "the power to stymie hate speech circulated by hate groups, but this means that all kinds of alternative ideas could be limited through tweaks to its algorithm," Melissa Zimdars, a professor of communications and media at Merrimack College, told the Monitor in December. "Overall, we need a lot more transparency about why we're seeing what we're seeing, and perhaps more importantly, more knowledge about what we're not seeing."

Bengaluru: Homegrown e-commerce giant Flipkart on Thursday said Peeyush Ranjan will join the company as Senior Vice President and Head of Engineering. Ranjan spent the last nine years in Google at its Mountainview, California headquarters, where most recently he managed Google's Android One engineering group, Flipkart said in a statement. He has also managed Motorola's Value Devices engineering group and was Managing Director of Google India for Research and Development, it said. Ranjan would work closely with Flipkart Commerce Platform (Head) Mukesh Bansal to build on the company's strong technology expertise and support its commitment to excel as a world-class technology company. Stating that the senior appointment comes shortly after Flipkart announced the hiring of Punit Soni as Chief Product Officer, who was a senior product management executive for Google and Motorola, it said both of them are moving from Mountainview, California, to Flipkart's headquarters in Bengaluru. Soni and Ranjan have worked closely together for Google and Motorola, including on the launch of Motorola's Moto G and Moto E devices, which are highly popular in emerging markets like India, the company said. "I am delighted Peeyush will be moving from the Bay Area to Bangalore to play this important role in Flipkart's further development," said Flipkart CEO & Co-Founder Sachin Bansal.

We’ve weathered the Penguins and Pandas that thankfully stopped old hacks from working these past couple of years; but what about what the next algo Zebra or Walrus, or maybe that bigger Elephant in the room affecting search traffic – personalization? This one’s even bigger and less cuddly than the two that came before. The thing we should really be aware of, however, is the fact that Google’s latest animal doesn’t have a name because personalization is invisible. Still, I’m going to call it Elephant because that just feels right to me. Here's a few things you need to know… Artificial Intelligence and User Experience are Coming Together It’s no secret that search is becoming increasingly personalized. A number of industry observers (myself included) noticed the trend long ago, and felt it significantly last year. Google isn’t just separating search results by location and device type; it’s also further incorporating search history and user behavior into its algorithm. That means no two people are guaranteed to see the exact same search results - in fact, in many cases they won’t even see results that are similar to one another, even if they use the exact same query. The effect of personalized search has gotten even stronger with the growth of Google’s AI engine, Rankbrain. By bringing together semantic (contextual) search with intent-discerning algorithms, the underlined software follows what amounts to a five-step process in hundredths of a second: Let a user enter a search string (while offering suggestions) Decipher what the user might actually be looking for, given the query and their location, plus search history Compare that to other successful searches and existing contextual databases Deliver the search results Examine user behavior to study choices made and on-site engagement Again, none of these elements is completely new, but the way they are combined with one another makes an enormous difference on search behavior and outcomes at a micro level. There’s Not One Search Algorithm Anymore The part of this market you really need to pay attention to has to do with context and history. When Google delivers a set of search results, it “learns” which ones are better than others by seeing the way actual humans react. If a searcher visits a site, finds their answer, and keeps looking at content, the search went well. If they immediately bounce and take their attention elsewhere, the search could be said to have been unsuccessful. Then, results can be reorganized in the future, with these kinds of tests taking place thousands of times per day. Step back for a moment, and you’ll begin to notice that while the initial search rankings might have been built from a somewhat-static algorithm, we end up with a dynamic situation in which each combination of search strings, location, and user behavior represents a new “market” to compete in. Those results are going to be refined again and again, essentially making Google’s engine smarter by the hour. Volume of searches becomes less important than intent behind a single search. The search engine is going to figure out which web pages are offering value (particularly in terms of informational content) and start to prioritize them. That’s true even if there aren’t traditional keywords and links that would have guided spiders and enhanced search visibility in the past. We are on the verge of entering a brand-new era where there’s not any single search algorithm. Instead, what we're going to have is a set of constantly shifting environments, where AI models try to direct users towards the most helpful results. And guess who’s going to come out on top? Fresh and Relevant Information Beats Traditional SEO At my company, we've been largely immune from Google’s algorithm mood swings (with the notable exception of being affected by local prioritization in the spring of 2016). The reason is simple: we never bought into any particular tactic or gimmick; instead, we always prioritize unique content and a good user experience. From a search engine optimization perspective, that’s like wearing classic suits that never go out of style. In a short course of time, we expect other digital agencies are going to come around to the same approach - they might be a little late to the game, but they're in the process of discovering that old school SEO just doesn’t have value anymore. Search engine designers have gotten too smart to let them keep gaming the system, and there’s too much at stake for users to get low-quality results just because they fit a particular formula. In the new world of search visibility – thanks to Google Elephant – it’s the smart marketers who provide fresh and relevant information that searchers like who are going to win. You can hold on to what's worked in the past, or you can look ahead to the future. What does your search optimization and inbound lead generation strategy look like now?

Washington: Internet domain company GoDaddy.com said it planned to stop registering domain names in China, joining Google Inc in protesting cyber attacks and censorship in that country. "We believe that many of the current abuses of the Internet originating in China are due to a lack of enforcement against criminal activities by the Chinese government," said Go Daddy Group Inc general counsel, Christine Jones. She said GoDaddy had repelled dozens of extremely serious attacks that appear to have originated in China in the first three months of 2010. Jones said GoDaddy, based in Scottsdale, Arizona, would continue to manage .cn domain names of existing customers. "Our experience has been that China is focused on using the Internet to monitor and control the legitimate activities of its citizens, rather than penalizing those who commit Internet-related crimes," Jones said. Google said in January that it had sustained a hacking attack that it said originated in China. This week Google shut its Chinese portal over censorship and said it planned to phase out deals to provide filtered search services to other online or mobile firms in China. Google said visitors to its China search engine, google.cn, were being redirected to Hong Kong-based google.com.hk. "I compliment Google and I compliment GoDaddy," said Democratic Senator Byron Dorgan, chairman of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, which focuses on human rights in China. Republican Representative Chris Smith said GoDaddy's action was "a powerful sign that American IT companies want to do the right thing in repressive countries." Google told the commission it was seeing intermittent censorship of some Internet queries from mainland China that had been rerouted to Hong Kong. "We are well aware that the Chinese government can, at any time, block access to our services," said Google's director of public policy, Alan Davidson. "Indeed we have already seen intermittent censorship of certain search queries on both google.com.hk and google.com." Internet censorship has drawn increased attention from U.S. lawmakers since Google's spat with China began and a policy initiative by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to promote global Internet freedom. "This is a foreign policy priority of the United States," said Democratic Senator Ted Kaufman, co-chair of the Senate's newly formed Global Internet Freedom Caucus. censorship China Cyber attacks GoDaddy Recommended For You MS Dhoni and Anil Kumble Deep in Conversation Ahead of Second T20 Sonam Kapoor Pulls Off A Denim Sari Like No One Else Star Tech: Watch SWAG King Raftaar's Take on Technology Past Wins Against Roger Federer Mean Nothing, Says Rafael Nadal Hero Motocorp and The Viral Fever Salutes The Indian Army Soldiers - 'The Real Heroes' Of The Country About Us Privacy Policy Disclaimer Contact Us Sitemap Complaint Redressal Advertise With Us sections India Lifestyle States Tech Politics Auto Sports iVideos Football Power Circuit Latest News Snapchat to Reveal Financials Within a Week EC Gives Green Signal to Next Episode of PM's 'Mann Ki Baat' Firefighting Sexism: Some Dutch Courage, Please Apple Joins Microsoft, Facebook to Find Best Practices For AI Shades Of India 2.0, Episode- 49: Priyanka Gandhi in Congress list of star campaigners for UP Watch LIVE From Network18 News18 India CricketNext News18 States Pradesh18 Bangla News Gujarati News Urdu News Marathi News Topper Moneycontrol Firstpost CompareIndia History India MTV India In.com Burrp CNN name, logo and all associated elements ® and © 2016 Cable News Network LP, LLLP.

San Francisco: Google has moved its Chinese-language search engine site to Hong Kong and stopped censoring its Chinese search results, the company announced on Monday. The move came after the web search giant announced on January 12 that it would stop censoring its Chinese search results after discovering a cyber attack that originated in China and which was aimed at compromising Chinese human rights activists. "Earlier today we stopped censoring our search services - Google Search, Google News, and Google Images on Google.cn," the company said on its official Google blog. "Users visiting Google.cn are now being redirected to Google.com.hk, where we are offering uncensored search in simplified Chinese, specifically designed for users in mainland China and delivered via our servers in Hong Kong." The company said it would continue to conduct research and development work in China and also continue to operate its advertising sales teams in the country. "Figuring out how to make good on our promise to stop censoring search on Google.cn has been hard," Google's chief legal officer David Drummond said. "We want as many people in the world as possible to have access to our services, including users in mainland China, yet the Chinese government has been crystal clear throughout our discussions that self-censorship is a non-negotiable legal requirement." "We believe this new approach of providing uncensored search in simplified Chinese from Google.com.hk is a sensible solution to the challenges we've faced, it's entirely legal and will meaningfully increase access to information for people in China. We very much hope that the Chinese government respects our decision." Google added that it will create a new web page that will track which Google services are available in China, and which are being blocked by the Chinese government. censorship China cyber attack Google Recommended For You Sonam Kapoor Pulls Off A Denim Sari Like No One Else Bigg Boss 10: Bani, Manveer, Manu, Lopa Relive The Moments Spent Inside The House Past Wins Against Roger Federer Mean Nothing, Says Rafael Nadal You Can Flight The Ball When Boundaries Are Big: Yuzvendra Chahal Hero Motocorp and The Viral Fever Salutes The Indian Army Soldiers - 'The Real Heroes' Of The Country About Us Privacy Policy Disclaimer Contact Us Sitemap Complaint Redressal Advertise With Us sections India Lifestyle States Tech Politics Auto Sports iVideos Football Power Circuit Latest News Snapchat to Reveal Financials Within a Week EC Gives Green Signal to Next Episode of PM's 'Mann Ki Baat' Firefighting Sexism: Some Dutch Courage, Please Apple Joins Microsoft, Facebook to Find Best Practices For AI Shades Of India 2.0, Episode- 49: Priyanka Gandhi in Congress list of star campaigners for UP Watch LIVE From Network18 News18 India CricketNext News18 States Pradesh18 Bangla News Gujarati News Urdu News Marathi News Topper Moneycontrol Firstpost CompareIndia History India MTV India In.com Burrp CNN name, logo and all associated elements ® and © 2016 Cable News Network LP, LLLP.

Google on Wednesday released Chrome 56.0.02924.76 for Windows, Mac and Linux platforms, and Mlynski was credited with finding and disclosing four high-severity vulnerabilities that were patched. Related Posts Google to Block .js Attachments in Gmail January 26, 2017 , 9:53 am Threatpost News Wrap, January 20, 2017 January 20, 2017 , 11:50 am Android Scoring System Roots Out Malicious, Harmful Apps January 19, 2017 , 10:00 am All four were universal cross-site scripting flaws in Blink, the web browser rendering engine developed by Google’s Chromium project and used in the Chrome browser. The vulnerabilities earned Mlynski $32,337; last May, he pocketed $45,000 after finding a number of high-severity issues that were patched in the browser. Mlynski has been a prolific browser vulnerability researcher, in particular at the annual Pwn2Own contest. In 2015, he used a cross-origin bug in Firefox to gain Windows admin privileges on a machine, earning himself $55,000; in 2014 he won another $50,000 with chaining together two Firefox flaws to gain privilege escalation on a Windows machine. The latest version of Chrome includes patches for 51 vulnerabilities, seven of which that were rated high severity qualified for rewards. Google patched 14 high-severity bugs in total, with the remainder discovered internally. Aside from the four Mlynski bugs, an unauthorized file access bug was found in Devtools, an out of bounds memory access issue in WebRTC, and a heap overflow in V8 were also rated high-severity and earned three researchers a collective $11,500. Google was also expected to begin deprecating SHA-1 in this version of Chrome. In line with the other browser makers, Google said in November that it would remove support for SHA-1 certificates starting with Chrome 56; Microsoft and Mozilla have announced similar deprecation schedules through the next month. SHA-1 has long been considered a weakened hashing algorithm and susceptible to collisions attacks. Experts have been urging site owners and application developers to migrate to SHA-2 or other modern algorithms, but success on that front has been mixed. Yesterday’s Chrome update also continues Google’s acceleration of its support for HTML5 over Adobe Flash. Starting with a slow rollout in Chrome 55, Google is expected to have enabled HTML5 support by default for half of Chrome 56 beta users. In Chrome 56, Google also paid out rewards for eight medium-severity vulnerabilities, and six others rated low severity. 0Categories: Vulnerabilities, Web Security Leave A Comment Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Sarah Tew/CNET Google announced in May that it would bring more than a million Android apps to Chromebooks, but only to certain machines. The company has now confirmed that all Chromebooks launched this year and onward will support Android apps. "Android apps will be coming to all new Chromebooks launching this year, but may not be available right "out of the box," a Google spokesperson confirmed. "That experience will depend on when the Chromebook launches and when Android Apps on Chrome OS is out of Beta. We don't have an update right now on timing, but stay tuned." Chromebooks are low-cost computers that run Google's Web-centric software. While useful for anyone who uses Google applications, such as the Chrome Web browser or Google Docs, Chromebooks have long been criticized for their lack of app support compared with computers running Windows or Mac OS. The Acer Chromebook R11, Asus Chromebook Flip and Google's Chromebook Pixel (2015) are the only Chromebooks that currently support Android apps, but Google has said that roughly half of all devices released in the past two years will be compatible in the future.

Google Google on Monday announced a major (and long-awaited) update to its Google Voice internet calling service. Google Voice, which hasn't seen a major update in almost five years, allows users to sign up for a single phone number that can be used across multiple devices to make calls and send text messages. The search giant is adding a variety of new features to the Google Voice app on Android and iOS, as well as the web. Its user interface got a facelift that makes it cleaner with a more intuitive design to help keep everything organized. There are now separate tabs in the inbox for text messages, calls and voicemails, for example. Google Other new features include support for group and photo MMS messaging as well as in-notification replies. It will also be easier to keep track of individual conversations, which will now stay in one continuous thread.

Going forward, the company has promised to provide even more updates and new features to the Google Voice apps.

YouTube user Kent Yoshimura embarked on the journey to have "A Very Free Birthday" which began by simply searching the phrase "free birthday stuff" on Google. "Although I'm not a big fan of birthdays, I am totally willing to take full advantage of it," Yoshimura said. He began his hunt for a feast of free birthday food by partaking in a free "Grand Slam" breakfast at Denny's before making the first of two trips to Starbucks for a free latte. Yoshimura also scored a free burger and fries from both Red Robin and Johnny Rockets and doubled up on free wings at Hooters. His healthiest meal of the day came in the form of a free salad from veggie grill, but he did indulge his sweet tooth by picking up Vietnamese iced coffee from Cafe Dulce, a free ice cream cone from Pinkberry and a free donut from Krispy Kreme. By the end of the day, Yoshimura had collected several meals, a free candle from diptyque and a free parking space, adding up to a grand total of $94.54 in free gifts. Yoshimura's day wasn't all glamour, as his request for free birthday goodies was shot down at a handful of franchises including Panda Express, Wetzel's Pretzel's, Haagen-Dazs, Helberg Diamonds and Jack in the Box, where he was denied a complimentary cup of water. He ended the day with a "free" cake provided by his family and friends, whose company he counted among his many gifts. "Yup. The best things in life are, in fact, free," he said.

Google has announced that it has worked with Facebook and Mozilla to make page reloads in Chrome for desktop and mobile significantly faster. According to Google's data, reloading sites with the latest version of Chrome should now be about 28 percent faster. From a report: Typically, when you reload a page, the browser ends up making hundreds of network requests just to see if the images and other resources it cached the first time you went to a site are still valid. As Google engineer Takashi Toyoshima notes in today's announcement, users typically reload pages because they either look broken or because the content looks like it should have been updated (think old-school live blogs). He argues that when browser developers first added this feature, it was mostly because broken pages were common. Today, users mostly reload pages because the content of a site seems stale. chrome internet security ← You may like to read: → Twitter Scrambles For Next Big Feature, Bets On Merging Tweets, Hashtags, Moments Silicon Valley Investors Call For California To Secede From the US After Trump Win Twitters Says It Will Ban Trump If He Breaks Hate-Speech Rules Ask Slashdot: Would You Recommend Updating To Windows 10?

Skip to content Military Technologies pr@satprnews.com HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Main Menu Auschwitz Jewish Center and Google Arts & Culture Announce New Online Exhibition on Jewish Life in the Town Next to Auschwitz Before WWII 26 January 2017Military News OŚWIĘCIM, Poland and NEW YORK, Jan. 26, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — On January 27, marking both International Holocaust Remembrance Day and the 72nd anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz and Birkenau, the Auschwitz Jewish Center will unveil its first project with Google Arts & Culture – the online exhibition OSHPITZIN: THE TOWN KNOWN AS AUSCHWITZ. The new exhibition will be made available on Google Arts & Culture platform. Through vivid photographs, compelling personal documents, and curatorial insights, the exhibition tells the 400-year history of Oświęcim’s (Yiddish: Oshpitzin) Jewish community. The exhibition can be viewed at this link: www.ajcf.pl/online-exhibition. Tomasz Kuncewicz, Director of the Auschwitz Jewish Center, said that, „This new exhibit is an important milestone in reaching out to new audiences with the local Jewish history so much overshadowed by the tragedy of Auschwitz and the Holocaust. We are proud that Google joined us in our mission to preserve the memory of Jews who lived in the Polish town of Oświęcim, before it became Auschwitz.” The Auschwitz Jewish Center is a subsidiary of the Museum of Jewish Heritage—A Living Memorial to the Holocaust, from the Museum’s New York City campus. It is the only Jewish presence in the vicinity of Auschwitz. The Center’s educational programs include immersive study programs on the Holocaust, pre-war Jewish life, and Polish-Jewish relations. The Center opened its doors in 2000 and joined with the Museum in 2006. Located just three kilometers from the Auschwitz–Birkenau death camps, the Center provides a place for individuals and groups from around the world to pray, study, and learn about the vibrancy of Jewish culture before the war, and memorialize victims of the Holocaust.  Google Arts & Culture is a new, immersive way to experience art, history, culture and world wonders from over a thousand organizations worldwide. Google Arts & Culture was created by the Google Cultural Institute and it is available for free for everyone on the web, on iOS, and Android. About The Auschwitz Jewish Center The Auschwitz Jewish Center, an affiliate of the Museum of Jewish Heritage since 2006, is located two miles from Auschwitz-Birkenau in Oświęcim, Poland. Nearly 30,000 visitors from all over the world visit the Center each year for prayer in the last synagogue in Oświęcim, innovative lectures and workshops, immersive education programs, and exhibitions on the Jewish history of Oświęcim. In addition to its programs for American military cadets, the Center hosts German, Austrian, Polish, and Ukrainian student interns at the Center each year, and thousands of young Americans and Israelis visit each spring during the March of the Living. Polish students, teachers, and police officers are served by specialized education programs, which teach about the local pre-war Jewish community and its devastation during the Holocaust, as well as anti-Semitism and xenophobia today. For more information, visit www.ajcf.pl. About the Museum of Jewish Heritage The Museum of Jewish Heritage – A Living Memorial to the Holocaust has thrived for nearly two decades along the waterfront of New York Harbor, and was created as a living memorial to those who perished, as well as those who survived, 75 years ago. Established as a place of learning and reflection, a repository for artifacts and information, and a catalyst for dialogue across all age groups about vital lessons of Jewish history, the Museum serves both local and global communities and creates opportunities for diverse audiences to engage with history and to consider its relevance to the present.

Here's what we want to see in Google’s flagship, including specs, features, camera, Android 8 and more. Latest Google Pixel 2 news and leaks We’ll update this section as more leaks come out regarding the Pixel 2, so make sure to check back regularly The Google Pixel hit the shelves late last year, so it's still too early for any concrete leaks about a sequel to one of our favourite phones of 2016. The biggest rumour so far revolves around one of our most requested Pixel 2 features, and it seems the upcoming flagship will survive a dunk in the bath. Google Pixel 2: What we (think) we know Google Pixel 2 – predicted specs Snapdragon 835 CPU, 4GB RAM 5 and 5.7-inch screens, both 2560 x 1440 Quick Charge 4.0 Android 8 Water-resistant body The Google Pixel 2 will be flagship device, and as such it’ll have pretty much all the top end specs available. We’d wager that there'll be a Snapdragon 835 CPU – the same processor that’ll likely power the Samsung Galaxy S8, but not the LG G6 – and either 4GB or 6GB RAM. HTC has stuck with 4GB RAM for its U Ultra, so it’ll be interesting to see whether or not Samsung and LG jump to 6GB. If Google does go with the 835, that means the Pixel 2 will be capable of Quick Charge 4.0. This is possibly the coolest feature of the new chip, as Qualcomm claims you’ll get five hours of juice from a five minute charge. Now that’s something we can get onboard with. Related: What's new in the Snapdragon 835? We might see a 4K display on the Pixel 2, especially if Google wants to push its Daydream VR platform forward, but no one has successfully managed to do this yet. The Note 7 was rumoured to pack this high-res panel and it didn’t, and it doesn’t look like the Galaxy S8 will either. Battery life, overheating and poor performance are all negatives of having even more pixels in a display, so we’d guess it’ll stay at quad-HD for the larger model and probably 1080p for the smaller. We’d like to see both gun for Quad HD, though.

We’ve heard nothing about what that might include yet, but Android ‘O’ (Oreo? Orbit Gum? Oatmeal cookie? Opal Fruit?) will surely revolve heavily around the Google Assistant – and making it even smarter. We might see some AI elements too – as that’s all the rage – and hopefully an end to the increasingly defunct homescreen. When does the Google Pixel 2 come out? Google tends to release its flagship phone in the Autumn, shortly after Apple unveils the iPhone. We'd peg the Google Pixel 2 with an October/November launch, with pre-orders going live immediately following the announcement. How much will the Google Pixel 2 cost? Google Pixel: £599 (32GB) | £699 (128GB) Google Pixel XL: £719 (32GB) | £819 (128GB) We would expect the Google Pixel 2 to hit the price-points as above – we hope lower – though possibly with higher storage at lower prices. Google Pixel 2: What we want The Google Pixel and Pixel XL are great, but we think there are obvious areas for improvement. Here are five keys upgrades we’d love to see in the Google Pixel 2. 1. A more enticing starting price We were spoiled with the Nexus series. High-end specs for a rock-bottom price was always too good to be true, and now that Google is taking phones seriously it’s a different story. Whereas the Nexus 6P hit shelves for less than £500, the Pixel XL runs up to £819 if you want a beefy amount of internal storage. It’s an iPhone-matching price that we’re just not sure Google is quite justified in charging yet. We'd love if the Pixel 2 came in at a lower price, but maybe that's asking too much just after Brexit. 2. Improved base storage, or a microSD slot Both Pixels currently offer either 32GB or 128GB of internal storage, but we’d like to see that base jump to 64GB. Like 16GB before it, 32GB is fast becoming redundant as 4K video files get bigger and mobile games become more ambitious. 32GB can easily be filled up with a few Spotify playlists and a holiday’s worth of snaps. Things aren’t helped by the lack of expandable storage, which is pretty much the norm on every other Android phone. 64GB seems a much fairer starting point, and Google could always offer up an iPhone 7 matching 256GB model for the media hoarders out there. 3. A more durable body Unlike many, we’re fans of the Google Pixel’s design. It’s not the thinnest nor the lightest, but it’s well built and manageable even if you plump for the larger model. We have noticed though that the metal used seems very to scratch and dent very easily. Even without dropping our Pixel XL, the corners and sides have got increasingly dinged. Considering its likely high starting price, it seems only right that Google should improve its components and give us a much tougher device. 4. Water resistance is a must The Google Pixel matches, and in most cases supersedes, flagships from Sony, Apple and Samsung in many areas but it’s still lacking something. A high IP rating (either IP67 or IP68) means you can dunk your phone in about a metre of water without any actual damage, and it’s a feature the Google Pixel 2 simply must have to compete with the Samsung Galaxy S8 and iPhone 7 (or iPhone 7S/iPhone 8). 5. Better audio throughout One of the Pixels few shortcoming are its downward facing and rather tinny speakers. Often a forgotten feature on phones – normally to save space – we love good speakers and DACs on phones. The HTC 10 has great audio, and it does make a big difference especially on media centric phones with large screens. Considering the current Pixel has a thick bezel running around the display, there should be enough room to jam in some decent front-firing speakers. Oh, and keep the headphone jack. Cheers, Google.

From email to photos, payments, and, of course, apps, your Gmail account is the key to making your phone hum, no matter what you’re using it to do. And just like you would with anything in your life that is so valuable, you probably aren’t protecting it as well as you should. But it’s not hard to get your account up to speed. Google has built a fantastic way to manage and secure your account right in the Settings app, and it’s worth taking routine trips to check on things. So if you haven’t been there in a while, we’ll walk you through the important stuff. Sign-in & security To get started, open the Settings app, scroll down to Personal, and tap the Google option. Inside you’ll find sections for Account and Services (as well as Developer if you’ve enabled it), which contain numerous tabs for managing various aspects of your account. For most of these options, you’ll actually be working in Chrome, not Settings. But since Google uses Chrome Custom Tabs, the experience is pretty seamless, and you won’t be jumping back and forth between apps. Greenbot The Google settings pane includes several important options for controlling your account. At the very top of the list is Sign in & security, which holds the keys to your main login. Tap it and you’ll instantly see something called Security Checkup, which lets you change your recovery phone number and email address, along with your security questions. Then, it’ll run through a series of checks to make sure your account hasn’t been compromised: recent security events, connected devices, and account permissions. Within each you should see phones and changes that you recognize, but if anything looks amiss, you’ll be able to make some changes. If there’s an app or service that shouldn’t have access to your account, for example, you can revoke its privileges, and if you see any unrecognizable devices, you can change your account password. Greenbot You’ll be able to turn on 2-step verification duting the security checkup. You should do so. The last option, 2-step verification, will show your verification settings and any backup options you’ve selected. And if you’re not using 2-step verification, you’ll be able to turn it on by following a few simple steps. For those who don’t know, 2-step verification provides an extra layer of security to make it harder for people to hack into your account. Instead of just a password, every time you log into your account you’ll be sent a code to your phone that is needed to unlock your account. We can’t stress enough how important it is to protect all of your accounts with 2-step verification, but it’s especially important for your Google account, so if you haven’t done so, use this opportunity to turn it on. You’ll need to re-enter your Google password on all of your devices, but it’s well worth the minor inconvenience. Elsewhere in the Sign in & security section, you’ll find tabs for each of the steps in the Security Checkup in case you don’t want to run through the whole thing. And you’ll also be able to change your alert settings and manage the passwords stored with Smart Lock. Personal info & privacy In the next tab, you’ll be able to tweak your privacy settings via a similar series of checks that let you tweak the information you share with Google and the public. Inside the tab you’ll be able to edit your email address, recovery phone, birthday, and gender, as well as things like location sharing, and your search settings. Greenbot The Privacy Checkup lets you control what aspects of your Google account other people can see. Like the previous section, you’ll be able to run a Privacy Checkup to make sure you’re not sharing anything you want to keep private. It’ll take you though six steps that let you tweak several settings to give you greater control over the apps and services that use your account. Follow the prompts and you can manage what you share on YouTube, disable automatic grouping and geo location in Google Photos, hide your phone number, change what people can see in your Google+ profile, tweak the activity date Google saves, and limit ad tracking. Depending on which services you use, it might be worth taking an occasional swing through the checkup to make sure your settings are still to your liking. Greenbot If you want to see what Google knows about you, you can download your data in the Personal info & privacy section of your account. Also in the Personal info & privacy settings you’ll be able to see what Google knows about you. All the way at the bottom of the page there is an option to Download your data, where you can export and download an archive of data from the Google products you use. You can select certain services (Mail, Calendar, Hangouts, etc.) or download everything in your account as either a zip, tgz, or tbz file, and choose to store it in your Google Drive, Dropbox, or One Drive account. Depending on how much data you opt to archive, it could take several hours to generate. Account preferences The third option in the Google settings pane is where you’ll find information pertinent to your account, including your language preferences and Google Drive storage allotment. You’ll be able to change either option, though keep in mind that an increase in your Drive storage will incur a fee.  Additionally, it’s here where you can remove services linked to your account. Tap the Delete Google Services option, and you’ll be able to unlink Google+, YouTube, or Gmail from your account. Greenbot You’ll have to jump through some hoops, but Google will let you delete your account if you’d like. At the bottom of the list, you’ll find the Delete your Google Account option, which will do more than remove it from your device. You will completely eradicate all existence of your Google account, so Google rightfully provides a series of necessary warnings and explicitly lists all of the songs, apps, movies, contacts, photos, etc., that will be deleted. But if it’s indeed what you want to do, you merely need to agree and press the blue Delete Account button at the bottom of the page. Services Occupying the rest of the Google settings are controls for various other parts of your account, including Smart Lock for Passwords, Location, Connected apps, and Ads. Most of them include minor options that you probably won’t care to change, but there are a couple that will be of interest. Greenbot You’ll find some important settings inside the Security tab in the Google settings. In the Security tab, you’ll find options to change your account’s security code (which is different from the passcode on your device), track your device in the Android Device Manager, and allow for remote lock and erase, both of which should be turned on. Additionally, users of newer phones like the Galaxy S7 and Pixel will find the Verify apps toggle here, which will scan side-loaded apps for malware. It’s here where you’ll also be able to add and delete any credit cards in the Android Pay section, and opt out of personalized ads in the Ads tab (if you haven’t already done it during the Privacy Checkup). And in the Networking menu you can tell your phone to automatically connect to open high-quality Wi-Fi networks.  To comment on this article and other Greenbot content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

You can… Got an idea for a Google Daydream app? You can make it! By Jon Martindale — January 26, 2017 7:03 AM Share Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Get our daily Tech News recap Mentioned here Google Daydream View MSRP $79.00 DT Recommended Product Learn More Why it matters to you Google's Daydream should end up with a lot more content in the near future. Google’s Daydream virtual reality platform has opened its doors to all and everyone who wants to make an app for it. Previously only a select group of partners could release software for the new mobile VR system, but now anyone can make a submission. It will still need to go through the Play Store’s submission process, but we should begin seeing a lot of new Daydream content in the near future. Google’s Daydream platform is similar to its previous Google Cardboard, but is built directly into Android 7.1 Nougat, so is entirely compatible with the company’s Play Store. Content released for it so far has been of a high quality, but it was limited. That seems likely to change now that anyone can submit an app for it. That’s not to say that just anyone can throw up an app and Daydream users will have access to it. Just like any app submitted to the Google Play Store, the developer will need to meet a certain number of requirements (thanks The Verge). Indeed, with the need for high frame rates in virtual reality, Daydream apps may be even harder than other apps to get past the validation process. More: Everything you need to know about Google Daydream Google has released a long list of guidelines for those looking to submit a Daydream application. Apps must have a 360-degree stereo photosphere for showing what the app looks like in use, must have a correct motion intensity level indicator, and must meet all “existing Google Play content policies.” Performance-wise Google mandates that submissions maintain a “consistently high frame rate and sustain low headset motion-to-photon latency.” Apps must also not cause the smartphone to display a thermal warning after a minimum of 30 minutes of play either. If you are able to build an app that can hit all of those guidelines, then you’ll need to opt-in to the Daydream distribution platform. Doing so and passing through the selection process will allow the app to be discovered by Daydream users within Google Play VR and Daydream Home.

Products like Amazon Alexa — which allows purchases by voice — and digital payments like Apple Pay are likely to disrupt the advertising industry and provide new methods for businesses to drive consumer spending, James Dix, securities analyst at Wedbush Securities, told CNBC's "Fast Money: Halftime Report" on Thursday. That could especially impact Google's hallmark business, search, Dix said. Getty Images Sundar Pichai, CEO, Google "There's fundamental challenges to search's business model," Dix said. "Search is roughly half of the digital ad market. Is that going to be more or less in five years? It would seem as though its going to be tough for it to go up in market share. Fundamentally, that's a very high margin advertising product." Dix is the only analyst listed in FactSet with a "sell" rating on shares of Google-parent Alphabet. His price target, $700 a share, is well below Thursday's price of around $852 a share, and the average target price of $966.29, from analysts surveyed by FactSet. "The market needs more people who think the market is actually pricing in the expectations," Dix said. The company will report earnings Thursday after the bell, when Wall Street is expecting adjusted earnings of $9.64 per Class A share on revenue of $25.23 billion, according to a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate. That would be up from a year ago, when the company reported $8.67 per share on revenue of $21.33 billion. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has said he, too, expects the "device" to fade away in the future, with new mediums like artifical intelligence taking over. The company has released a voice-activiated product, Google Assistant, to aid with the transition.

Google Maps Parking Assistant Is Live In 25 Cities Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Google Maps Parking Assistant Is Live In 25 Cities January 26, 2017 1:27 pm EST By Ashlee Kieler@akieler A parking spot for me? google maps google maps parking parking information That didn’t take long. Just a week after a beta test of Google Maps’ latest app version showed the company was testing a new feature intended to alert users to potential parking problems, the service is now live.  Google announced Thursday that its latest Maps update would allow users in 25 cities to gauge just how difficult parking might be at their destination. As previously noted, the feature doesn’t seem to provide granular information — like where you’ll find a spot, or if you’ll have to pay for parking. Instead, it will use “historical” data to determine parking difficulty, so you won’t actually be able to see current parking conditions. The same type of data calculations are used for the company’s popular times and visit duration metrics. If you’re heading to an area with limited parking opportunities, you’d see a big “P” in a red circle with a message stating “Parking is usually limited near this destination.” If parking is less problematic in that area, the app will describe availability as “medium” or “easy.” For now, the feature is available in San Francisco, Seattle, Miami, Atlanta, Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, Minneapolis/St. Paul, New York City, Orlando, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, San Diego, St. Louis, Tampa, Washington, D.C., Cleveland, Dallas/Fort Worth, Denver, Houston, Phoenix, Portland, OR, and Sacramento.

Mobile Apps by Alfred Ng January 26, 2017 9:47 AM PST @alfredwkng Up Next Meet Jon Hamm, the hologram (aka the holohamm) Enlarge Image The tool is currently available only for Android devices and in 25 cities. Google You don't have to drive around breathlessly hunting for an open parking spot anymore. Google Maps is introducing a new feature that gives users a warning on how hard it is to park at their destination. It's currently available only on Android devices, and in 25 select cities, such as New York, San Francisco, Washington and Los Angeles. If you're in one of those cities, when you punch in an address Google Maps will pull up a parking difficulty icon on the directions card, ranking from limited to medium to easy. With the warning ahead of time, it's easier to pull up to a different block or street and find a parking space instead of circling around hoping somebody will leave. Like Google's Popular Times and live crowd count features, the parking function compiles data from users storing their location information on Google's servers. Because it's using historical parking data, the information will not be in real-time like Google's crowd-tracking tool. Here are all the cities the Google Maps parking tool will be available in: San Francisco Seattle Miami Minneapolis/St. Paul Boston Charlotte Chicago Detroit Los Angeles Atlanta New York City Orlando Philadelphia Pittsburgh San Diego St. Louis Tampa Dallas/Fort Worth Cleveland Washington Denver Houston Phoenix Portland Sacramento Share your voice 0 comments Tags Mobile Apps Google Maps Google Related Stories Will 'Target Pay' in-store mobile payments help it combat Apple Pay?

Name: Subject: Message: You can now send GIFs in Allo with Google’s new chatbot, Lucky Apps & Games Newsby Jimmy Westenberg2 days ago 5 262 10 While they might not be what everyone has been asking for, Google has been working hard to bring a number of fun new features to its smart messaging app, Allo. We’ve seen new Star Wars and Stranger Things-themed sticker packs, Chrome Custom Tabs support, and much more. If you’ve been waiting for SMS support, a web client, or any other useful feature, we’re sorry to say those still aren’t here. What is present in this new update, though, is a new way to send GIFs to your friends. Previously, Google Assistant was the only chatbot baked into Allo, but now there’s one more – Lucky. In what’s likely a nod to the “I’m Feeling Lucky” button on Google.com, calling upon Lucky in any of your chats will provide you with the GIF of your choosing. Say, for instance, you’d like to send a puppy GIF to your friend. Just open your chat, type @lucky, then type the word “puppy”. Lucky will then post a puppy or puppy-related GIF to your chat. See also: Google Allo: Everything you need to know September 21, 2016 A few things to note, though. You can’t call upon the all-knowing Lucky in a chat with Google Assistant (so you’ll have to actually find someone else using Allo to test this feature out), and Lucky seems to be a tad slow at the moment. Sometimes the GIFs freeze up or take a few seconds to start playing. It appears only some users have the ability to use Lucky at the moment, while some users still don’t. If you’d like to give Lucky a shot, make sure you grab the latest version of Allo via the Google Play Store link below.

Share Tweet Share Tags : Android-Android+ Google-Google+ After suggesting the next Pixel device will be waterproof, 9to5 Google is back with a big batch of information from a "source that has been reliable in the past." While you shouldn't go on believing everything you are about to read, the revelations and suggestions about upcoming Pixel devices are interesting. The source claims that waterproofing is "still on the table," rather than being a definite addition to future devices. Google is said to be focusing on the camera, working on improving low light photography and making the most of a camera sensor that isn't large in megapixels and adding extra features. Google is allegedly testing multiple Pixel 2 models with Qualcomm and Intel chips. Apparently, Taiwanese chip maker MediaTek was also part of the project for a time, but isn't an longer. Additionally, Google is prototyping a lower-priced "Pixel 2B" with a more modest spec sheet. The phone is scheduled for release "alongside or shortly after the Pixel 2" and is aimed at emerging markets, with the goal of bringing the "Google experience and Google Phone" outside mature markets. While the Pixel 2B will be "significantly cheaper" than its big brother, the Pixel 2 is said to command "at least" a $50 price premium over the current Pixel phones. The Pixel starts at $650, so a $50 price increase is still reasonable for a high-end smartphone. While there's no time frame for their release, the new Pixel phones should be ready for an October announcement. Google traditionally announces new smartphones then, and it's not likely to skip a beat. We'll be learning more details about the Pixel sequels in the months prior to their release.

So when the Pixels are in a VR headset, the front firing speakers (ffs) get muffled, and blocked inside a VR headset. Unlike the low resolution iPhone 7 that you own, the Pixels have higher resolutions, and greater density displays compared to any iPhone. Something that is needed for VR, but since Apple themselves doesn't support VR on any of its iPhones. Then I guess you don't care about that stuff. Also the Pixels have a 3.5mm audio jack built in. posted on 2 days ago, 23:05 0 in response to #13 in response to #13 Hide Reply 27. Mxyzptlk (Posts: 15154; Member since: 21 Apr 2012) You are wrong. I don't care about VR, so get over it. There's no reason to not have ffs with the amount of bezel space available, but I see that you would rather deflect from the truth than make a convincing argument. posted on 2 days ago, 14:09 1 Reply 16. marorun (Posts: 4100; Member since: 30 Mar 2015) Adding OIS to camera mean bigger camera module mean a bump in the back so its wont be sexier... waterproof no thanks i dont want an overheating oven.... for the rest i am with you. posted on 2 days ago, 14:39 0 in response to #16 in response to #16 Hide Reply 18. fiji.siv (Posts: 73; Member since: 25 Nov 2015) LOL "sexier" when referring to a Pixel.

Scott93274 (Posts: 5140; Member since: 06 Aug 2013) While I was impressed with the image stabilisation software, it simply looked too robotic when you turned your camera while recording, I think I would rather have OIS as well. I'm also excited to see what they do with their camera as they're still putting a lot of work into improving it. I still think the Pixel's camera is the best smartphone camera on the market. posted on 2 days ago, 20:11 1 Reply 23. ibend (Posts: 5515; Member since: 30 Sep 2014) EIS inside pixel work much better at stabilizing video compared to OIS on S7 (PA already make article about that camera comparison) but OIS also great since it can help in low light condition (combine it with huge pixel sensor size :D) why not both? it's possible :D (zenfone 3 use 3-axis EIS and 4-axis OIS.. but no one care, lol..) posted on yesterday, 05:29 0 Reply 28.

Qualcomm would have to somehow come out with a much superior SoC before 2018 and Sony/Samsung/Omnivision come out with a fancy new sensor to warrant a proper upgrade. posted on 2 days ago, 22:36 0 Reply 25. vincelongman (Posts: 4708; Member since: 10 Feb 2013) People said that about the Pixel yet its backordered in most countries The new Qualcomm SoC won't come until at least 2018, likely March 2018, 5 months after the Pixel 2 release Also major jumps in camera sensors don't happen every 6 months (or even every 12 months) The Pixel 2 will be at least competive with the 2017 iPhone and Note8 posted on 2 days ago, 13:19 2 Reply 14. jellmoo (Posts: 1759; Member since: 31 Oct 2011) I'd definitely be interested in a mid-range style Pixel. I can't stomach the price of the current models so a price hike would be nuts for me. Mid level specs with a price to match though?

Panzer (Posts: 7; Member since: 13 May 2016) Well no waterproofing, a FHD panel on 5" model, huge bezels. The camera is the same as the Nexus 6p and 5X though it is a very good camera. WIth the exception of the 821 Snapdragon please explain to me the premium hardware. Then the updates. As a former Nexus owner Google was nice enough to give us the latest bastardized version of Android months later. So don't say software support if they will screw over the Nexus owners when a new line comes out they will screw over the Pixel owners also. posted on yesterday, 07:35 0 Reply 30. tokuzumi (Posts: 1026; Member since: 27 Aug 2009) $50 additional for an already overpriced phone? No thanks. I have no problem spending half as much on something from OnePlus or another Chinese manufacturer, to get 90% of the features the Pixel offers. 1 2 Next » view all comments Want to comment?

Now, 9to5Google has received further details about the upcoming handset from an insider source, who tempered expectations for a waterproof device, noting that the feature is “still on the table.” The source goes on to state that Google is continuing to put a strong emphasis on camera performance. With the Pixel 2, Google aims to “master low-light photography,” ditching a high megapixel camera in favour of one with a more robust feature set. The first-generation Pixel’s camera was reportedly pitted against waterproofing during development. To include both, the company would have needed more development time and the resulting phone would have cost more, according to Hall’s tweets. Additionally, the source says the Pixel 2 is testing improved chipsets from two manufacturers: “some with Snapdragon 83X chips, others with Intel chips.” With these new additions, the Pixel 2 will reportedly bring a higher price than the original Pixel by at least $50 USD. However, Google is testing lower-end Pixel devices with lesser specs and a lower price tag that could be ideal for emerging markets. The original Google Pixel debuted in October 2016, and launched to glowing reviews with an aluminum body, Snapdragon 821 processor, 4GB of RAM and a 12.3-megapixel rear shooter with an impressive DxOMark score.

Sorry Google, I can’t do this any longer. I’m breaking up with you. LeTricolore It’s the same price as other premium smart phones, and most blogs had it as the best smartphone of 2016. it was great that the first few Nexus phones also had great prices, but it’s not like the Google Pixel is overpriced compared to what else is out there. Ridge Not talking about this year’s Pixel. I’m referring to the article stating that the Pixel 2 will be at least 50USD more expensive than the Pixel. LeTricolore I understand that. I’m sure the Samsung Galaxy S8 will cost a bit more than the S7. I’m sure the iPhone 7S will be more than the iPhone 7, etc. Google released a phone that was widely successful, and now they’re improving upon it. It makes sense that they’ll charge more. Ridge I have to disagree, because I don’t believe that it makes sense that they’ll charge more. It make senses that last year’s model will be discounted, and the new model will be priced the same as last year’s model at launch. That is make makes sense to me. Brett Arnold Allard Ever heard of increased cost of living? Brett Arnold Allard One plus is a good example of increasing cost per device every year. Ridge You’re not wrong, but Oneplus offers comparable devices for less than the competition. They didn’t decide to start charging what everyone else was charging because they could. Anaron That really depends on how many new things they add. There will come a point where adding something increases the price. Jesse Everyone phone company always improves their phones for the next year and a lot of them have usually kept the same price point. Other than moving it up when the dollar started sucking and what not. Smanny If it comes with a newer QHD+ or 4k display with a SD 835, even better camera. Then why wouldn’t that kind of configuration command more money? Ridge I understand your logic, but that is why older models are discounted throughout the year before the launch of a new device. If the new device is worth more, shouldn’t the older device stay at the same price forever while the new devices continue to increase in price? I believe that old devices should be discounted while the new devices come out at the same price point. Smanny But the Pixels are still new and still hard to get right now. Not to mention if you are into VR, then the Pixels will give you one of the best mobile VR experiences. Hands down. Not to mention it’s image stabilization (EIS) is second to none. Ridge I definitely agree with you! The image stabilization is mind-blowing, as are the mobile VR capabilities. However, I find it hard to justify new models getting more and more expensive, while last years models get less and less expensive. It should be one or the other. thereasoner Curious. I didn’t get the Daydream VR with my Pixel because it has the lower resolution screen and also because my wife is using my GS6 now so I still have access to my Gear VR. What do you like more about the Daydream set up that has you favoring that platform over Samsungs? Smanny Daydream VR apps are guaranteed to support the 9-axis controller, something that still has to be added to Gear VR. Sure you get a touchpad and a few buttons on the side of the Gear VR headset. But the Daydream VR controller has brought some version of spacial awareness to it’s platform. Gear VR has yet to do the same. Sure the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift offer much better and more robust spacial awareness to their respective platforms. But at least it’s some degree of spacial awareness for Daydream VR. For instance their is a game called wands, where you can move your hand around like your holding a magic wand. That kind of thing is impossible on Gear VR. Another cool game called Archer E. Bowman where you use the controller for Archery. Another game that is impossible to play on Gear VR unless the platform supports some kind of spacial awareness controller. There is a number of other apps that will not work on Gear VR. thereasoner Ah, yes, the included controller. I can see how that could enhance the experience. How’s Daydream content overall though, is it comparable to the Samsung/Oculus partnership in terms of available apps? I don’t do phablet sized devices otherwise the XL would have been my choice. It helped that I still have my Gear VR to use so no regrets, I love my Pixel. Unorthodox “Low end model”. Too late. I’m team 1+3T for the next couple of years. Ridge Can’t disagree with that; Oneplus is the new Nexus. mat have they solved the QA issues? Myself and 3 friends all ordered 1+1s. All of us had a different, equally frustrating issue. Not to mention the pitiful update schedule lol. Needless to say, I’m now skeptical of what they put out. Ridge Not sure. There’s always room for improvement, that’s for sure. JD Wait low end model? How much lower do they want to go and overcharge people? Attackpoodle Intel? Google dropped X86 support only to make a flagship with it?

I’ve had a chance to check one out over the past couple weeks and it appears they’ve succeeded in exceeding my expectations. While the NVIDIA Shield TV 2 is without a doubt the best streaming player for gamers, it’s also a streamer that is all an Android TV should be—easy to use, feature rich, a cord-cutters dream. It includes everything from broadcast TV with DVR to Sling TV for cable channels, to most movie streaming services. Its powerful processor handles all of it smoothly and a new menu system makes it easy to get around. From the first time you turn it on, it is clear that the Shield has an Android operating system. If you have an Android phone or tablet, you can fully set up the shield with your Google account. In the phone’s Google app say “set up my device.” Although it found the Shield, this was one of the few experiences that didn’t work as it should. Thera are a few bugs that need to be squashed (NVIDIA is working on this) as it stopped working we had to go back to manually setting up the wifi and Google account. Still, setup was straightforward and relatively quick. The home screen is easier to use than previous generations. The top line shows videos, games, music and photos that you’ve recently accessed along with recommendations of what you might to check out in other apps based on what you have been viewing. Below that is a couple of lines of the installed apps. All lines are continued in a horizontal carousal. Whatever title you have highlighted appears as a backdrop at the top of the screen. The Shield comes pre-installed with the usual Android fare— Google Music, Google Movies and YouTube— as well as Netflix, Vudu, Amazon, and Plex. UHD, 4K content is available from the four services along with 4K HDR from Netflix and Amazon and it is simply an amazing picture quality. (Note that I don’t have a TV with HDR, but the 4K picture quality and HD streaming was some of the best I’ve seen.) Audio match the video quality as the Shield has more surround sound capabilities than any other streaming player to date. It supports AC3, EAC3, Dolby 5.1, Dolby 7.1, DTS-HD, DTS-HD MA, Dolby TrueHD, DTS-X, and Dolby Atmos pass through to add incredible sound to the clear, rich picture. For personal media streaming, Plex is so well integrated into the Shield that you would think that it was part of the operating system (it isn’t). It can be set up to use the Shield as a Plex server. With the Shield acting as a Plex Server, I was able to access my media from home or away without leaving a computer powered on. The review unit I received included a Samsung USB 3.0 128 GB flash drive that could be set up with the Shield as “internal storage.” This extends the 16 GB of storage on the Shield to add media libraries. It was very easy to add the flash drive as internal storage as the option pops up as soon as the drive is connected to one of the two USB ports. Setting up the Plex server is more straightforward than setup on other devices when creating movie and TV show libraries on the drive (or presumably on the internal storage of the 500 GB model). For those with a PlexPass premium account, Plex offers a live TV and DVR beta. Live TV is available on the Shield by connecting an HDHomeRun tuner with attached antenna to your router. I’ve tried tuners before, but the HDHomeRun with a Mohu Antenna seems to be able to bring in more channels from various directions than previous attempts I’ve had in trying to get live TV. While I wasn’t able to setup the DVR feature in Plex (I’m still trying to find answers and will update when I do find out tips to setting it up), I was able to access live TV through both the HDHomeRun View app and the Android Live TV app. Any kind of content I could want is available on the Shield without having to change inputs— live broadcast TV with DVR, live pay-tv channels from Food Channel to Comedy Central and sports through Sling TV, and everything from Hulu to Netflix, to Amazon and Vudu (and many more streaming apps through the Google Play store). Voice searched helped me find what I wanted to watch quickly. The voice search feature on the Shield brought up results in more apps than the agnostic Roku search. It displayed results for titles in more apps including Sling TV, Vudu (including my Ultraviolet movies) and Plex libraries (the first device that is able to find titles in Plex). When I clicked on the results, it was inconsistent. Sometimes it would take me directly to the title where I could start playing immediately. Other times it opened the app where I would have to search for the title in the app—usually Vudu and Sling TV. While the voice commands can launch apps, find and play titles, it cannot be used to control playback—pause, play, fast forward or rewind. The Shield has Google Assistant. Google Assistant can do some of the features of a Google Home with the added benefit of video. This is similar to Alexa on Fire TV. When asked it could show traffic, weather, and answer questions—simple math problems, the distance to the moon or the distance to drive to San Francisco, or what time it is in Tokyo. It’s still a bit fussy as many questions I asked showed results of YouTube videos on the subject. Voice command can launch an app but unlike Siri on Apple TV, it doesn’t search for apps that are not on the device. NVIDIA has announced that the fully functioning Google Assistant will be available in the coming months. When the feature is officially launched the Shield will have full Google Home skills to turn on lights and control a smart home as well as other tips and tricks. Still, it’s a pretty good start. Because the Shield has Google Cast— with 4k Chromecast capabilities— it works with the Google Home in the same way as other Chromecast devices. When I told my Google Home to play songs by James Taylor or to play oldies (from the Google Music app), it would wake up my Shield that has HDMI CEC control enabled. This means it also turned on my TV and receiver and switched to the right inputs. When I had chosen Spotify as my default music app (in settings on my Google Home phone app), it could not turn on the Shield or play music automatically unless the Spotify app was open on the Shield. The Google Home app had an option to link Netflix to the Google Home, but it’s not ready to be used yet. A first for the Shield is the ability to ask Google Home to show specific photos. As I back up my iPhone photos to Google Photos, I could command, “show my photos of waterfalls on the Shield.” It also to show dogs, beaches, trees, pictures of my son, and photos taken in Kenya. Unfortunately, the music stops playing when photos are shown as both require “casting” from the Google Home. To activate voice commands on the Shield, press the microphone button on the remote or the NVIDIA button on the controller. Both the remote control and the game controller have been redesigned in the new NVIDIA Shield. The sliding volume channel in the center of remote and on the controller remain the same as the first generation. It’s very sensitive and easy to accidentally turn up the volume when pressing the navigation button which is used to play/pause, fast forward and rewind videos. The Shield is Bluetooth enabled so I could to pair my headphones or plug them into the game controller so I didn’t have to worry about inadvertently blaring the volume when the household was asleep. While I don’t usually focus on gaming, I would be remiss to leave out the gaming capabilities of the NVIDIA Shield. Gaming on a streaming device is usually pretty basic—only mobile gaming or choppy experiences of other games. Only game consoles like the Xbox or Playstation have been able to offer a latency-free gaming experience. The Shield’s powerful quad-core Tegra X1 mobile processor brings true PC gaming to the TV. It can stream games directly from a PC, play Android games, and stream online games from NVIDIA GE Force game service. My son (who worked for years at a video game store) tests the games as I observe and get insights. First, he used the Gamestream feature to play games on his PC. The detailed lands of The Witcher looked beautiful on the big screen. Although the first time he played, there was a bit of a hiccup as the frame rate dipped (possibly due to home network issues), subsequent play was smooth and absolutely latency free. Low or no latency is essential to a good gaming experience. The experience of playing Batman-Arkham City from NVIDIA’s streaming GE Force service was equally smooth and beautiful. The new Shield is about thirty percent smaller than the previous model. It includes a Gigabit Ethernet port, full-sized HDMI 2.0 port with HDCP 2.2 (required for 4k video), and 2 USB 3.0 ports. The processor is claimed to be twelve times faster than any other media streamer on the market. Both the remote control and the game controller are included. The 16 GB model runs $200, and the Shield Pro with 500 GB of internal storage is $300. While the game controller might be off-putting to the average viewer, the NVIDIA Shield TV is an excellent choice for anyone who wants to stream media, and ideal for cord-cutters. As features continue to be added, you’ll be able to control your lights, Nest, and other connected home devices like a Google Home device. It has the capabilities of a 4K Chromecast. And it can stream and access any kind of content you could want, playing it at the best audio and video quality. The Shield has gone to the top of the list of my favorite media players. Log in or register to post comments COMMENTS Great Review Submitted by jaredjcrandall on January 26, 2017 - 11:11am I agree on all points. I have atmos/dts:x and the shield is the only streamer that has apps that can do so as well. I had roku but hbo now would only do stereo, same with xbox one s. The shield is also so quick and no where near as buggy as xbox one s. The only thing the shield can have to make it the ultimate media device is a 4k blu ray player, but I just don't believe that 4k hard media will catch on i.e. streaming media will conquer.

Submitted by javanp on January 26, 2017 - 2:02pm OK, either the Shield received a serious update in the past few months or your PLEX expectations are far lower than mine and many other peoples' on AVS. I'm guessing maybe you've never ran the Plex client on an HTPC? For one, the now-standard "skip ahead ~30 seconds" feature was replaced with a "I thought you went extinct with VHS" fast-forward. On top of that, it either did not pass through DTS-MA or getting that to work was excessively tricky. I bought one of these to see if I could replace my HTPC with a simpler, more reliable hardware client, but like so many others on AVS, it just couldn't compete with an HTPC, bugs and all. Log in or register to post comments About Plex Submitted by dommyluc on January 26, 2017 - 2:37pm Yeah, what is it about this undying love for Plex? I could never figure out why so many people use that program. I am mostly concerned with audio streaming, and it wouldn't even stream my WAV files. And any program that wants to organize music by the artist's FIRST NAMES is laughable! As Kenan says on SNL, "What up with that?" Log in or register to post comments Hi-Res audio Submitted by mlknez on January 27, 2017 - 9:34am You never said in your review what audio formats it's capable of handling... DSD such as .dsf, .dff, SACD .iso files? Multi-channel? DSD256? PCM in .iso files? Multi-channel? 384khz? MLP files? Does it downsample? convert? or stay bitperfect? I consider audio files "media streaming" as well.

Waterproofing is one of them, and the Google Pixel 2 release date may remedy that situation if a new report proves true. To say the Pixel phone is popular was an understatement. As Google has moved away from the Nexus line and opened things up more to the public, things have flourished and the newer devices are in high demand. The Google Pixel 2 launch is still quite a ways off, but that has never stopped the rumor mill from churning. That said, this time around it’s an old rumor that has gained new life. Last October, the folks at 9to5Google got wind that that the Google Pixel 2 would be water resistant to a degree in 2017. The Senior Editor on staff, Stephan Hall, tweeted the news yesterday and it’s safe to say that’s good news if you thought that was a misstep this year. Apparently, they were going to slap water resistance onto the handset but were unable to line things out in enough time and chose to work on the cameras. That means some of their original ideas will more than likely carry over to the Google Pixel 2, including water proofing. Little tidbit we were told in October last year that I forgot about: “Waterproofing definitely coming with next Pixel device.” — Stephen Hall (@hallstephenj) January 25, 2017 While water resistance may seem like a minor thing, you will appreciate it once you’ve dropped your smartphone into the sink or toilet. Liquids aside, we expect the Google Pixel 2 specifications to improve as well although it’s pretty stout already given that fact it’s only a few months old. That said, we would assume 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage (minimum) could be in the cards as that’s the next step up from what we have now. The SD835 is an obvious choice as well along with updated cameras and better audio. The waterproofing (or anything else) has not been confirmed obviously, but should be a given next year. If Google sticks to their time frame, we will have to wait until October to see the Google Pixel 2 and Google Pixel XL 2 launch. We expect to hear plenty of rumors before that day rolls around, so stay tuned and we’ll keep you informed as more details emerge. via – Business Insider Tags androidgoogleGoogle Pixel 2smartphones Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Add to Google+ Add to Pinterest Post navigation Previous article Previous post: Official Apocalypse Now video game hits Kickstarter seeking Funding Next article Next post: Samsung Galaxy S8 design leaks along with the price Adam Adam is a techie, who loves new gadgets and all things Westeros.

Here's a rundown of the new features we expect the second-generation model to have. It has only been a few months since the Google Pixel and Pixel XL’s release, but we’re already hearing rumors and news about the 2017 model that’s expected to launch in the fall. We don’t know what Google’s planning on naming the next model, so we’re tentatively going to stick with the Pixel 2. Here’s everything you need to know. More: Google Pixel review An even better camera The Google Pixel was praised for its stellar camera that rivaled the iPhone 7 Plus, but it seems as though Google is prioritizing it again for the second-generation device. That’s according to a source speaking to Stephan Hall, senior editor at 9to5Google. We cannot verify this source’s claims, and we’re a long time away from the release date so things can change. The source said Google is looking to perfect the low-light capabilities of the next Pixel, but it will “not have large [megapixel] size.” Google will reportedly compensate for this with extra features. Waterproof Pixel? Hall posted a tweet that the next-generation Pixel will be waterproof — information he received at the Google event last October. Going by what Apple and Samsung have done for their flagship devices, the Pixel 2 will likely be IP67- or IP68-rated, allowing for water submersion up to 1 to 1.5 meters for 30 minutes. But Hall now says waterproofing may not be so definite anymore. His source said the feature is “still on the table” for the Pixel 2 — which is hardly as concrete as “definitely.” Little tidbit we were told in October last year that I forgot about: “Waterproofing definitely coming with next Pixel device.” &mdash; Stephen Hall (@hallstephenj) January 25, 2017 The reason it wasn’t in the current Pixel? Google ran out of time. According to a Wired podcast, Google said it threw out plans for the device at the end of 2015 and had to start from scratch — meaning the phone was built in a mere nine months. Huawei was supposed to manufacture the device, but the company backed out when Google demanded there be no Huawei logo. HTC took Huawei’s place. Google-made processor? Google may be trying to make its own processor — like Apple does for the iPhone — to power its future smartphones. That’s all according to Dave Burke, Google’s vice president of engineering, in an interview with Bloomberg. More: Checkmate, Apple: Why Google’s Pixel is a genius move for Android It seems unlikely that these chips will be ready for the Pixel 2, as building a custom processor is no easy feat. New information from Hall’s source tells us that Google is reportedly testing the Pixel 2 with multiple, improved chipsets — “some with Snapdragon 83X chips, others with Intel chips.” MediaTek was also contributing at some point, but not anymore. Until Google is ready to make its own processors to power its smartphones, the company is searching for which chipset will power the Pixel 2 the best. We’ll have to wait some time before the company settles on one manufacturer. A budget Pixel Many Android enthusiasts frowned when Pixel’s price tag was revealed — it certainly was more pricey when compared to previous Nexus devices. In 2015, Google offered the Nexus 5X as a budget device, and the more expensive Nexus 6P as a flagship. The company might follow up with a similar strategy for the second-generation Pixel. Hall’s source said Google is testing a few prototypes of a device code-named “Pixel 2B.” This device would cost a lot less than $650, with the compromise of less-powerful hardware. This device, which may launch alongside the Pixel 2 or after, will be intended to be released in “different markets.” More: You’ll soon be able to control your smart home with the Google Pixel It sounds akin to the Android One program that brought the “Google experience” at budget prices in developing countries. There’s a rumor the company may bring the Android One program to the U.S., but it’s unclear if the Pixel 2B will follow suit. Release date and price Google has traditionally unveiled its Nexus smartphones, as well as last year’s Pixel, during a fall event. We’ll likely see the Pixel 2, as well as the Pixel 2 XL (Pixel XXL?) in October. Unfortunately, you may see a price increase for the flagship Pixel 2. Hall’s source said Google is expecting “at least” a $50 price jump for the device, but the Pixel 2B will be “significantly cheaper.” Keep in mind, the company is months away from a release date and all of this is subject to change. We’ll update this post as we learn more about the 2017 Pixel 2 and the Pixel 2B. Article originally published in January. Updated on 01-26-2017 by Julian Chokkattu: Added rumors of a budget “Pixel 2B,” how waterproofing is “still on the table,” a slight price increase for the Pixel, and how Google is testing multiple chipsets from different manufacturers.  Also watch: Share

Business Facebook Director Peter Thiel Is Leading The Search For Trump’s Top Antitrust Officials The billionaire Facebook board member is on the hunt for candidates to chair the Federal Trade Commission and lead antitrust enforcement at the Justice Department, sources say. William Alden BuzzFeed News Reporter Hamza Shaban BuzzFeed News Reporter View this image › Drew Angerer / Getty Images ID: 10401011 Peter Thiel, the billionaire venture capitalist and Facebook board member, is leading the Trump administration’s search to fill the government’s two top antitrust enforcement jobs, two people familiar with the matter have told BuzzFeed News. While the process is ongoing, the candidate said to be the preferred choice of another tech giant, Google, is unlikely to be picked, the people added. Thiel, who supported President Trump in the campaign and then joined his transition team, is vetting candidates for chairperson of the Federal Trade Commission and antitrust chief at the Department of Justice, the two officials who enforce the nation’s anti-monopoly laws, according to the people familiar with the matter. On Wednesday, Trump named Maureen Ohlhausen, a Republican FTC commissioner, as acting chairwoman, but the search for a permanent chair continues. One candidate to lead the FTC, Joshua Wright, a former commissioner at the agency, is seen as Google’s favorite for the job. Wright has ties to Google from his earlier work as a law professor, when he received funding from groups backed by Google and co-wrote a paper sympathetic to the search giant. But Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google’s parent company, who supported Hillary Clinton’s campaign, has struggled to gain traction in Trump’s circle, one person said. Google, which spent $15.4 million in 2016 lobbying Congress and federal agencies, could now be left in the cold. A leading contender to chair the FTC is Sean Reyes, the Utah attorney general, according to the people. Reyes last year co-wrote a letter to the FTC asking the agency to consider reopening an antitrust case against Google that it had closed without bringing charges. One challenge for Thiel, according to people familiar with the search, is finding candidates who are Republican and yet willing to diverge from the libertarian position that the government should basically leave companies alone. Trump’s campaign rhetoric suggested he would favor candidates who envision an active role for antitrust enforcement, and Thiel’s search has reflected that, the people said. Both Wright and Ohlhausen fit in the traditional conservative mold. At a Heritage Foundation event Tuesday, Ohlhausen was asked by New America Foundation Fellow Matthew Stoller whether President Trump could wield antitrust policies to promote American jobs. “She basically said no,” Stoller told BuzzFeed News. 2. She said 'not to be callous' but that she was 'concerned about importing other values' into competition law. — Matt Stoller (@matthewstoller) ID: 10401026 GCR earlier reported that Thiel was helping to fill the two antitrust jobs. A spokesperson for Thiel did not immediately provide a comment, and spokespeople for the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Reyes declined to comment, while Wright did not respond to a request for comment. A Google spokesperson also declined to comment. Thiel’s prominent role in the antitrust vetting process is notable in part because he is a director of Facebook, a company with dominant positions in social media and messaging. Between them, Facebook and Google now account for more than two-thirds of all online ad spending, Bloomberg News has reported. Still, someone close to Thiel said that the venture capitalist’s foremost concern is finding candidates who fit with the president’s particular ideology. As a businessman, Thiel has praised monopolies, saying that the profitability that comes with dominant market power can give companies the leeway to invest more in their employees and in risky research and development. “Only one thing can allow a business to transcend the daily brute struggle for survival: monopoly profits,” he wrote in his book Zero to One. The company Thiel has singled out as a prime example of such a monopoly: Google. Under president Obama, the FTC took a special interest in emerging technologies and their implications for data privacy. The agency’s Mobile Technology Unit, and later, the Office of Technology Research and Investigation, were created to extend consumer protection to the digital economy. Consumer issues tied to mobile health apps, smart cars, algorithmic transparency, and the internet of things became part of the agency’s ongoing research. Former FTC Chair Edith Ramirez, who served on the commission from 2010 through Trump’s inauguration, has also called for a comprehensive data privacy law. Enforcing baseline cybersecurity practices was another key issue under her tenure. But despite the agency’s enthusiasm for novel technology, critics of the Obama-era FTC argued it was largely absent on antitrust enforcement. The agency’s handling of an antitrust investigation into Google’s search practices is perhaps the most contentious episode. While European regulators have leveled multiple antitrust charges against the company, the FTC closed its investigation into Google’s search practices in 2013. In President Trump, however, some see the potential for an antitrust revival. In October, Trump’s senior economic advisor Peter Navarro attacked the proposed AT&T-Time Warner merger, and name checked the trust-busting Theodore Roosevelt. Trump himself said the deal would concentrate too much power in one media company, seizing on the economic populism that fueled his successful run to the White House. But President Trump has since softened his remarks against the mega merger. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

Google is expected to place a major focus on the Pixel 2 camera. Sources tell 9to5Google that Google wants to “master low light photography” with the Pixel 2, and that while Google isn’t planning to cram a ton of megapixels into that camera, it does intend to pack some extra features in there. Another detail that’s rumored for the Pixel 2 is waterproofing. While this feature is locked in quite yet, it’s said to be “still on the table,” according to the source of today’s report.  Google is reportedly still deciding on which processor to include in its next flagship smartphone. There are said to be models in testing with Snapdragon 83x chips, some with Intel processors, and some with a custom chipset developed by Google. The Pixel 2 is still quite a ways away from release, so it’s not surprising to hear that Google is testing multiple processors to determine which is best for its next big thing. Finally, it’s said that Google is testing different prototypes of the Pixel 2, including a lower-cost “Pixel 2B.” While the Pixel 2 could be at least $50 pricier than the Pixel (the base model Pixel is priced at $649), the Pixel 2B is expected to be “significantly cheaper” if it does come to market. There’s no mention in today’s report about when the Pixel 2 might make its official debut, but if Google follows the yearly update cycle that most other manufacturers do, then we should see the new device in October. As for its features, the Pixel has caught some flak for not being waterproof like the iPhone 7 or Galaxy S7, so it’d be surprising if Google didn’t address that with the Pixel 2. And when it comes to the camera, the Pixel is often lauded as having one of the best smartphone cameras on the market, and I’m sure that Google wants to keep that title with the Pixel 2. Other features are still up in the air, but the Pixel 2 is going to be a flagship device, so it wouldn’t be a surprise if features like a Snapdragon 835, at least 4GB of RAM, USB Type-C, and a fingerprint reader also made the cut. The Pixel 2 may not debut until October, but it’s sure to be one of 2017’s most anticipated devices, so we’ll likely see more leaks and rumors surrounding the phone in the coming months. What features do you want to see in the Pixel 2?

Follow TechnoBuffalo While the Google Pixel was an excellent phone, the best phone, there’s still a lot to improve upon. One such improvement may be waterproofing, as we heard earlier this week. Now, another report claims Google is planning to make even more exciting changes when the Pixel 2 is released this year. According to 9to5Google, one of Google’s main focuses will be on the Pixel 2’s camera, an area the company’s device already excels at. Google will reportedly emphasize low light performance, something all mobile devices struggle with. The current Pixel produces decent pictures in low light but the Pixel 2 will be even better, the report says. “We’re further told that the phone’s camera will ‘not have a large MP size,’ but will rather ‘compensate in extra features,’” 9to5Google says. The report goes on to say Google is testing multiple chipsets, including “some Snapdragon 83X chips,” along with chips from Intel. Google is also said to be developing a custom chipset for the device but it’s unclear if it’ll be ready in time for the Pixel 2. “Multiple test devices with different chipsets are being used now,” a source told 9to5Google. Unfortunately, a Pixel with more advanced specs could lead to a price increase by “at least” $50. Google’s flagship is already fairly expensive—$649 for the cheapest model—so the base price could be raised to $700 on the low end. Let’s hope Google can at least keep the price competitive when the device eventually launches. There may also be a “budget” Pixel In addition to the Pixel 2, Google is said to be working on a “Pixel 2B,” which 9to5Google’s source said will feature less powerful hardware and “will be significantly cheaper.” However, it sounds like there’s a possibility the budget device may not launch at all, so don’t get your hopes up just yet. The Google Pixel is still relatively new, so it’s a little early to start dreaming about the sequel. However, considering a new cycle of flagships are just on the horizon, it’s no surprise to hear Google is already hard at work on the Pixel 2. Let’s hope that in addition to an improved camera and specs, Google will also introduce a sleeker design.

More by Jonathan Takiff Bowled over: Why it's a super time to buy a TV Jan 24 Google, Facebook, and Pew are going after cyber con jobs and fake news Jan 26 Verizon-Charter merger chatter heats up Jan 26 Cyber con jobs are on the rise, wreaking havoc on consumers and the social fabric, new evidence from Google, Facebook and the Pew Research Center argues. Google took down 1.7 billion deceptive and shocking ads in 2016 that violated its advertising policies, the company said Wednesday. That's double the level of a year ago. Among the ads it disabled, Google cited 900,000 containing malware, 68 million for “health-care violations” (up from 12.5 million the year before), 80 million that “deceived, misled or shocked users,” and 17 million for promoting illegal gambling. It took action against 47,000 sites touting weight-loss scams, 15,000 sites pushing unwanted software on users, and 6,000 sites and 6,000 accounts for advertising counterfeit goods. The search giant snared more bad guys by expanding its policies — now including payday-loan ads — and with upgraded detection technology. It found 7 million ads that intentionally tried to trick the detection systems and 23,000 “self-clicking” mobile ads that automatically loaded apps onto devices without the users' OK.   Both Google and Facebook lit into the fake-news crisis, and detailed some responses, in blog posts Wednesday. Google’s detection systems suspended 1,300 accounts last year that cloaked ads as news. And after reviewing 550 sites “suspected of misrepresenting content to users, including impersonating news organizations,” it took action in November and December against 300, with nearly 200 publishers booted off its network permanently. Hitting the fakers in the pocketbook, the move means they will no longer have access to the Google AdSense system, which places display advertisements on popular sites. In November, Google was notably shamed by media aggregator Mediaite for the top search placement given to a “final election vote count 2016” story that incorrectly stated Donald Trump had beaten Hillary Clinton in the popular vote.  While not recounting wrongs wrought, Facebook acknowledged Wednesday that it is tweaking its Trending Topics feature, which has been blamed for spreading false information. To “help prevent hoaxes and fake news from appearing,” Facebook said, it will demand more “transparency” (that is, clarity/truthfulness) in the original headlines. And its search engine will now emphasize news stories that achieve traction from a number of publishers, rather than putting weight on a single, intensely read article or multiple “mentions of a topic.” Cyber fraud also loomed large in the findings of a Pew Research Center study issued Thursday. Pew found that 64 percent of adults surveyed have directly experienced some type of significant data theft or fraud, 49 percent of respondents believe their personal data have become less secure in recent years, and about 25 percent now lack confidence that the federal government and social-media sites can keep their personal information safe and secure from unauthorized users. Driving citizen concerns, Pew found, was that 41 percent of polled Americans have encountered fraudulent charges on their credit cards and 35 percent have been notified that sensitive information like an account number has been compromised. (Sometimes, the notifications are cons themselves. When resetting a password, don’t do it through a notification link, but by visiting the website itself.) Sixteen percent of Pew’s 1,040 U.S. adult study participants suffered a takeover of their email accounts, and 13 percent said one of their social-media accounts had been breached. Those often lead to cons such as: "Hi. I’m stuck in Paris. My wallet and passport have been stolen. Please wire cash.” Fifteen percent of those polled said they have received notices — real or bogus  — that their Social Security numbers had been compromised, 14 percent said someone had attempted to take out a loan or line of credit in their name, and 6 percent  found that someone had impersonated them to file fraudulent tax returns and score tax refunds. Compounding the cyber insecurities and crimes, Pew found that many Americans don’t follow best practices: Forty-one percent share passwords with friends and family members; 39 percent use the same or very similar passwords for multiple accounts, and  25 percent resort to simple, more easily guessed passwords. On the mobile-device front, Pew found that about 10 percent of smartphone owners risk known security breaches by never updating the operating system or apps. Fifty-four percent engage in sensitive activities such as online banking or e-commerce while connected through  an unsecured public WiFi network.  More Coverage Facebook takes aim at fake news with new 'trending' formula Jan 25 - 8:00 PM Commentary: Media have responsibility to the public Dec 27 - 1:07 AM Penn-based FactCheck.org partnering with Facebook to expose fake news Dec 15 - 9:16 PM Debunking fake news is teachers' latest task Dec 11 - 7:15 PM Published: January 26, 2017 — 12:10 PM EST We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that doesn't contribute to an engaging dialogue Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate our guidelines Commenting policy | Comments FAQ Comment policy: Philly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations.

The promise of “regular updates” is more significant, and Google has confirmed to us that one of those upcoming features is VoIP integration. Up to now, Voice features have been predominantly used through Hangouts on Android. While that service can continue to be used, Google encourages switching over to the new Voice apps for Android, iOS, and the web for new functionality in the future: Going forward, we’ll provide new updates and features to the Google Voice apps. If you currently use Hangouts for your Google Voice communication, there’s no need to change to the new apps, but you might want to try them out as we continue to bring new improvements. At the moment, the switch comes with one notable downside. The lack of VoIP means that there is no way to make or take phone calls — except through Hangouts or by Voice’s call forwarding feature. Now, however, Google has confirmed to us that VoIP integration for the new Voice is in the works: The updated Google Voice app doesn’t have VoIP features — it has the same features for making calls as the existing Google Voice app. Hangouts will ring by default in addition to any forwarding phones on your account, just as it did before. (Again, not a change with the new app.) We are working on VoIP integration. The full extent of this change unknown, but according to one of our tipsters, WiFi calling is coming to all devices, with the goal of it serving as a fall back when cellular service is unavailable. This ability to make a call through your number regardless of device — and even on the web — could single-handedly make Voice a full featured cellular alternative, if not a full replacement. These upcoming features come as Hangouts continues to move its way toward being primarily an enterprise product. Presumably, that future service would drop all legacy remnants of Voice integration and focus on becoming a competitive tool for businesses and other larger organizations.  To do so, one of our tipster tells us that “heavy encryption” is in the works for Hangouts.

So what can they do on a shoestring budget, and what’s the most effective approach? These questions were put to a panel of experts and entrepreneurs at a Telegraph Small Business Connect seminar about SME branding and marketing on Wednesday. For Raja Saggi, head of SME marketing at Google, the best approach for keeping costs low is to keep things simple – don’t try to be the biggest, flashiest or best. Use drag-and-drop template tools such as Wix or Moonfruit for your website, which start at just a few pounds a month, he said. Also on the panel was Kelvin Golding, small business ambassador for the Chartered Institute of Marketing, who outlined a low-cost approach known as referral marketing and advised SME owners to encourage their customers to shout about how great their shop or service is. “Encourage them to do reviews on websites such as Google Reviews and Tripadvisor,” he said. If you want to appear professional, you can easily end up explaining it with jargonRaja Saggi, Google He also advised SMEs to think about the search terms people use online to find products and services similar to what they offer. Use an online keyword analyser, such as Google Trends, to find the relevant words and phrases, which you can use on your website pages and blog posts to improve SEO (search engine optimisation). Alice Mayor, founder of souvenir store, We Built This City, said that Instagram was a particularly useful – and free – tool for marketing her business. Customers getting in touch after seeing products featured on the company's Instagram page helped drive sales by as much as £20,000 early on. “We didn’t have any money for a proper shoot, so we tried to take the best shots we could in store,” she said. “On Instagram, everything has to be visually stimulating, and humour is key. "Even if it’s just a product, it’s all about describing it with personality, which helps build a good rapport with your audience.” Mr Golding agreed that how you talk about your company is just as important as what you say about it. Formal or informal, speak to your customers in a tone of voice that they’re familiar with, he explained. And if you don’t know what that is, ask them, he said. Pose the question: “do you like or dislike our tone of voice?” “If you have a unique product and want to appear professional, you can easily end up explaining it with jargon,” added Mr Saggi, who advised business owners to avoid inaccessible terminology and keep descriptions short and simple.

But whether you plan to hold onto it for years or switch it when the next hotness comes along, you still want to make sure you're getting the right phone for you -- whether that's a budget buy or a high-end handset. Here are our favorite phones right now: - High-end ($600, £500, AU$800 or more): Google Pixel, XL; iPhone 7, 7 Plus; Samsung Galaxy S7/Edge  - Midrange (around $400, £300, or AU$550): OnePlus 3/3T  - Entry-level (around $250, £200 or AU$330): Motorola Moto G4 Looking for more options? Check out our current picks for best phones here. Top tips: - Know what you care about most: Is it screen size, camera quality, battery life? This will help narrow down your choice. - Don't discount the midrange:You can still get a great phone that does almost everything that a premium phone can do, for a fraction of the price. - Try to hold the phone at a store first: You may love or hate the way it looks and feels in person. - Shop for sales: Look for deep discounts around major holidays. And find out your grace period in case you need a quick return or exchange. - If you buy a global phone, make sure it works with your carrier bands first. - Have you already bought a lot of iPhone apps and iTunes movies? Stick with iPhone if you still want access to them. Likewise, if you've invested in any Android-only software, you'll want to stay on that side of the fence. - Buy a case and glass screen protector: You'll protect your phone from costly damage, and will increase the phone's resale or trade-in value for when you're ready to move on. Learn how to recycle your phone for cash. If you're buying an Android phone Android has the better native maps app and assistant by far (known as Google Now or Google Voice Search). Another Android benefit: it ties into the same Google services many people already use. Major updates are typically announced in May or June and often arrive first with Google's official Nexus or Pixel phone, but this schedule's been less consistent lately. Look for: - Android 7.0 or higher: This current OS will get you the most recent goodies, including a battery-saving feature called Doze on the Go. - Android 6.x: This version is older, but not a dealbreaker. Some phone manufacturers take longer to upgrade Android. Pricier and more popular phones are more likely to get the update. If you're buying an iPhone iOS updates come right on time for almost every phone. iPhones seem to develop fewer weird tics over time and they play better with other Apple products, like Macs. Apple usually announces the latest major iOS version in June, and releases it in September. Keep in mind:  - Older iPhones are cheaper, but run the risk of losing out on newer hardware-based features in future phones. - If you can, wait for 2017's 10th anniversary iPhone -- rumors are, it'll be a doozy or die trying. Big phone or small screen? If you insist on a phone with a small screen (under 4.5 inches), look at the iPhone SE or Sony Xperia X Compact. Otherwise, get used to anything from 4.7 to 6 inches (or even larger). For screens 4.7 inches and larger: - Look for a minimum screen resolution of 1080p. - A 2,560x1,440 resolution is even better, especially for 5.5-inch screens and larger. - If you plan to use a VR headset like Google Daydream, the higher the resolution, the better -- when the phone is inches from your face, pixel count matters. Camera quality If you don't follow camera tech, a list of sensor brands and f-stops won't make much sense when trying to determine if your photos will be any good. Remember that: - Higher megapixels don't always equal higher quality shots. A 12-megapixel camera might take better photos than a 16-megapixel camera. - That said, phones with 8 megapixel rear cameras only appear on budget phones these days. Expect middling quality. - If a phone has two rear cameras, it's there to create an optional depth effect (also known as a background blur) or to give you a wide-angle option. - Optical image stabilization, or OIS, helps prevent blur from shaking hands. This is especially helpful when shooting indoors or in low-light. It won't help with blur caused by a moving subject, though. - Most phone cameras come with HDR, self-timers, beauty mode and plenty of filters and effects. Battery life and performance Most phones from the middle price range and up can handle a basic day's worth of phone calls, email, gaming and music needs, though some internal tech is more refined than others. Some midprice phones even use the same chips as those with nosebleed prices. In general: - You'll need to charge most phones once a day, so plan accordingly -- stock up on an extra charger for your workplace or your bag. - You'll typically get longer life from a 3,000mAh battery or above. - Maps and music streaming suck down battery life faster than other activities. So does keeping brightness on full blast. - An octa-core processor isn't always "better" than a quad-core chipset. - For Qualcomm's Snapdragon processors, higher-numbered chips are the most recent. So 821 is newer (and faster) than 617 and 400. Bonus features - Fingerprint scanner -- usually on the back, power button or home button. - MicroSD storage on some Android phones. - Water-resistant, IP67 and higher is best. - Wireless charging, as available on the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge. - Stereo audio speakers or enhanced audio through headphones. - USB-C connector, the new standard for Android phones. - Removable battery -- note that this feature is becoming rare. What about budget phones? When a low price is the most important thing about a phone, you're guaranteed to make some compromises. But there are still some great budget phones that give you more for their price than others. Right now, we like the Motorola Moto G4 most, but we're looking forward to 2017's refresh. Hold off if you can for the next crop. The recently-announced Honor 6X looks promising and Lenovo is due to update to the Moto G5. Other questions to ask yourself - If it has a USB-C port, do adapter dongles (for example USB-to-USB-C) come in the box, or will you need to buy one? - Does it have a standard 3.5 mm headphone jack or will you need to buy an adapter dongle? - If the phone breaks, what will you have to do to fix it? - Does the phone support Wi-Fi calling? - Is it locked to a carrier or can you add a SIM card for any network? Do you lose any features either way? - Can you travel with it internationally by simply swapping the SIM card? - Is it the same price if you pay in full as you do in installments? (It should be.) - Will the warranty cover your needs or will you pay for an extended warranty? Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

How To Transfer Files To & From Your NVIDIA SHIELD 2017 Japanese Support Added To Google Translate Word Lens January 26, 2017 - Written By Dominik Bosnjak The latest Google Translate update introduced Japanese support for the Word Lens functionality of Google’s mobile tool, meaning users are now able to translate Japanese to English in real time by simply pointing their camera at any Japanese text. Masakazu Seno, one of Google’s software engineers, said that this new feature will surely help tourists explore Japan, adding how all they need to do to take advantage of it is download the latest version of the Google Translate app from the Google Play Store. Google’s mobile tool was already capable of translating images of Japanese text using optical character recognition (OCR) technology, but the latest app update also brings this functionality to Word Lens, an augmented reality (AR) feature of Google Translate. Unlike the older solution which requires you to capture an image, Word Lens works in real time and is an extremely convenient tool to have once you find yourself in a foreign country and are trying to navigate using street signs. Nonetheless, the AR functionality of Google Translate works best when tasked with simple translations, Google says. Anyone looking to translate something that’s more complex than a restaurant menu should still probably opt to use the app’s Camera Mode for more accurate translations. Finally, both the Camera Mode and Word Lens are capable of operating offline provided that the Google Translate app already downloaded all of the necessary data packages. Word Lens initially made an appearance in Google Translate back in early 2015, shortly after the Mountain View-based tech giant acquired Quest Visual, a small startup that created a standalone AR translator of the same name. Ever since then, Google has been hard at work improving both this feature and Google Translate as a whole. Today, the company’s Android app can translate 103 languages, more than half of which are also supported offline. Apart from the Japanese support for Word Lens, the new Google Translate update also fixes a bug which occasionally prevented people from sharing their translations through Facebook’s Messenger. The update started rolling out earlier this week and should already be available for download from the Google Play Store.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Google Maps now warns you about parking nightmares Chris Davies - Jan 26, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Google Maps is about to get a whole lot more useful, with an update to the navigation app not only showing where there’s parking at your destination, but how busy it’s likely to be. The update, which will initially only be offered in Google Maps for Android and operate in select locations, adds a “Parking Limited” warning to route guidance. When you see that, you know that it’s probably worth leaving early to give yourself extra time. In fact, there’ll be three levels of warning that Google Maps can offer, ranging from Easy, through Medium, and finally Limited. Google is using historical popularity data to figure out what level to show, much in the same way that it can calculate which are the popular times at venues, and how long on average people stay there. That’s based on aggregated and anonymized data from users who have opted in to Google Location History. Unfortunately, to begin with at least it also means there’ll only be data in a handful of cities and districts. Google says it’ll encompass 25 locations initially, though hopes to expand it over time. San Francisco, Seattle, Miami, Atlanta, Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, Minneapolis/St. Paul, New York City, Orlando, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, San Diego, St. Louis, Tampa, Washington, DC, Cleveland, Dallas/Fort Worth, Denver, Houston, Phoenix, Portland and Sacramento Similarly, there’s no word on when parking difficulty indicators will be coming to the iOS version of Google Maps. For the moment, it’ll be rolling out to Google Maps for Android only, though we’d be surprised if that stayed the case forever. It’s only the latest expansion in Google Maps in recent months, pushing the app from being simply a way to get driving directions from A to B, and instead offering a more holistic travel guide. Earlier this month, for instance, Google integrated Uber ride-hailing directly within its Maps app. Previously, though you could see estimated wait-times and prices for Uber rides within Maps, you’d be switched over to the Uber app itself to actually book a car. In December 2016, meanwhile, Google added wheelchair accessibility details to points-of-interest listings, helping those needing ramps and such to figure out where they could and couldn’t go. In the same month, Google integrated a “find my friends” emergency style feature into the Maps app, dubbed Trusted Contacts, which can ping out an alert if someone finds themselves in a sketchy situation.

Israeli mobile ad analytics company AppsFlyer has raised $56 million, increasing the total capital it has raised since it was founded to $84 million. "We're the world's biggest company in our field," says AppsFlyer cofounder and CEO Oren Kaniel. The round was led by new investors Qumra Capital, as well as Goldman Sachs Private Capital Investing (PCI), Deutsche Telekom Capital Partners (DTCP) and Pitango Growth. AppsFlyer enables app developers (such as Gett) to economically analyze the effectiveness of their campaigns on mobile. The company does not sell or buy media; it measures the return on investment (ROI) for buying media. According to the company, this market had a $6 billion turnover last year just for its platform; in other words, the market is bigger than that. The current financing round follows substantial growth in the company, which asserts that its revenue has grown six times over during the past two years, but does not disclose how much that revenue is. AppsFlyer measures 250 billion actions using over 10,000 apps each month. Its important customers include Samsung, HBO, Waze, Playtika, Alibaba, Baidu, Trivago, Macy's, and others. It is an official analytics partner of Google, Facebook, Yahoo, Adobe, Twitter, and more than 2,000 others. The company plans to use the capital it raised mainly for expanding its business in China, which includes Chinese partners Tencent, Social Ads, and Baidu. It will also consider acquisitions in the Israeli and global markets. "Globes": Explain what your company does. Kaniel: "We measure actions, and not just advertising, by app developers. In professional language, what we're doing is called mobile attribution analytics. In other words, we examine the connection of all sorts of information points that were not previously connected. 'Attribution' means if the user sees something on Facebook and later sees something on Google, and this makes him perform a certain action, such as downloading or operating an app, or buying something. We're able to attribute this action to what he saw on Facebook or Google. For example, social games giant Playtika installs our systems in its app, and from then on, it can begin its marketing efforts, such as advertising on Facebook and other social networks. Then it checks how many users came from each place, and what each user did. If we assume that the cost of recruiting one user is $1, and within two weeks, he spent $10 on an app, then there is no doubt that this user is very profitable for Playtika, and it wants as many users as possible like him. Based on the information we provide, which is precise information, not estimates, Playtika can bring more users from the same channels using the same marketing strategies. "Actually, without our system, Playtika and others wouldn't have this information. They would spend a lot of money, but most of that money would go to waste. The advertisers and their advertising agencies hope that every dollar they spend has a positive ROI, but they don't really know whether it's true. Only when you put in a measuring tool can you know what each dollar does. You can even check what the dollars you invested six months ago and a year ago did." Haven't you gone too far? Effective economic measurement of marketing on digital media is not a new industry. "I'm referring to mobile, but I haven't gone too far at all. The entire advertising industry is based on agencies that tell the client, 'Listen, you need $10 million here and $50 million there. Just believe me that it's worth your while.' When we entered the market in 2012, no one welcomed us with open arms. Everyone liked getting money without guaranteeing anything, except for the advertisers themselves, and it's their money. Actually, to this day, most of the industry works that way, both on the web and of course on television. There's no measurement. So we didn't go so far. It just didn't exist, and in the specific case of mobile, the technology didn't exist. You can go deeper on the web and get all sorts of information points, but it still requires a lot of hard work by every one of the advertisers. We created this technology for mobile." RELATED ARTICLES Mobile ad measurement co AppsFlyer raises $20m What is the company's business model? "SaaS - every client pays us licensing fees for our software, and we don't have performance-based revenue sharing. Advertising agencies themselves are our clients. "The market of advertising platforms like Facebook and Google is a market that competes for every dollar, and this is not a software market," says Kaniel. "There's no loyalty in it. One day, you can buy media from one platform, and the next day from a different one. From a market of 'give me money, and I'll bombard the Internet with your messages,' this market has become a market of 'You have to generate real value from each message.' That's the change that the industry has undergone. The advertiser no longer wants to pester half the world with his message. The consumer is not allergic to messages; he's allergic to advertisements that don't interest him. In the end, this industry has forgotten that there are people on the other side of the screen: you and me." The Goldman Sachs investment arm has invested in the company. Does that mean that it will push hard for an IPO in the future? "In the distant future. We still have a lot to do and a lot of value to reveal as a private company." Qumra Capital managing partner Boaz Dinte who joins AppsFlyer's board said, “AppsFlyer has proven its ability to provide mission critical tools and data-driven innovations for measurement that marketers and developers need for success. As mobile and marketing converge, it’s clear that AppsFlyer is primed for further growth and we are thrilled to provide more resources for the company to expand its capabilities as a data powerhouse for marketers that’s in a league of its own.” Published by Globes [online], Israel Business News - www.globes-online.com - on January 17, 2017 © Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd. 2017 5 Comments View comments in rows Update by email about comments talkback POST Comments Your name Please insert your name Content Your comment Thanks You comment was recieved and soon will be published.

 A Harvard student who received internship offers from Google, Apple, and Facebook explains how she tackles the trickiest interview questions Áine Cain Jan. 26, 2017, 12:31 PM 39,453 facebook linkedin twitter email print Think out loud, says Harvard junior Jessica Pointing. Jessica Pointing Some of the biggest companies in business today ask pretty tricky questions during job interviews. Brainteasers can be a great way of allowing candidates to highlight their critical-thinking and reasoning skills. However, in a high-stakes interview, they also pose an opportunity for interviewees to trip up. Harvard University junior Jessica Pointing has received internship offers from companies including Google, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, McKinsey, Bain, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley. Business Insider spoke with her to find out how she approaches the most puzzling interview questions. Pointing, who features educational and career advice for high school and college students on her website, the Optimize Guide, recalls feeling stumped by a particularly difficult brainteaser during an interview — although she declined to provide the specific question. "I remember thinking, 'I have no idea how to do this. I'm not going to do well in this interview,'" she said. However, she says that dispelling your worries is the first step in successfully tackling a brainteaser. "When you get a tricky question, get rid of any negative thoughts," she said. "Think, 'OK, I can do this — now how am I going to approach this?'" Pointing says there are three steps to follow to work through a brainteaser: Repeat the question. Talk through your reasoning. Ask plenty of questions about your assumptions along the way. She says that thinking out loud will allow the interviewer to hear your thought process and that speaking through the problem will help you organize your thoughts. Plus, if it's clear you're on the wrong track, the interviewer might be more inclined to give you a hint. "The interviewer wants to hear your thought process," Pointing told Business Insider. "How you approach the problem is just as important, if not more important, than the solution itself." As a result, the biggest mistake you can make in a brainteaser isn't coming up with the wrong answer — it's panicking and blurting something out without any explanation. Jeff Zwelling, the COO of the job search engine ZipRecruiter, previously told Business Insider about one of his favorite brainteasers: "A hammer and a nail cost $1.10, and the hammer costs one dollar more than the nail. How much does the nail cost?" "Some candidates will instantly blurt out 10 cents, which is obviously wrong," he said. "They don't have to get the exact right answer, which is a nickel, but I want to see them at least have a thought process behind it."

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Gmail is getting a whole lot safer with one simple change Eric Abent - Jan 26, 2017 1 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Beginning next month, Gmail is going to be much safer to use. That’s because Google is going to start blocking Javascript attachments from Gmail messages, potentially shutting down a major security risk. This isn’t the first time Gmail has blocked certain types of attachments, and Javascript will be joining other types like .exe, .msc, and .bat files. As outlined on the G Suite blog, this new Gmail policy will go into effect on February 13, 2017. That’s the rapid release date, with the standard release happening two weeks later. After those dates, you’ll see a warning within Gmail when you try to attach a .js file to your message. This applies to any Javascript files that may be lurking within archives too, so there won’t exactly be a workaround in this instance. Blocking Javascript from Gmail attachments doesn’t mean that they’re being blocked from Google services entirely, however. Google says that if you still need to send a Javascript file to someone, you’ll be able to do so through Google Drive or Google Cloud Storage. While this might become a headache for some folks out there, it’ll could vastly increase security for others. Some of the world’s less savory people can use Javascript attachments to sneak in malware under the radar, putting people who may not be so vigilant at risk. This move by Google should prevent at least some instances of that happening, so this is a case of Google protecting Gmail users from themselves. Once February 13 rolls around, Javascript will be blocked for all Gmail users. The roll out should be over quickly, too, with Google only expecting it to take one to three days. To read more about this decision – and to see which other file types are blocked from Gmail – check out the source link below.

The codes can then be redeemed on the Google Play Store to buy digital content like movies, games, e-books, Android apps etc., the company said in a media release. Users first need to select the ‘Google Play’ option on their FreeCharge app or website, make the payment, after which they will receive the recharge code. The code can later be redeemed by using the ‘Redeem Now’ link on the Google Play store. Last week, Paytm also introduced the facility to allow Android users across India to recharge their Google Play accounts. Earlier this month, Google introduced the option to allow users to pay for their purchases on the Play store via carrier billing. “At FreeCharge, our endeavour remains to diversify the payment categories for our consumers. This is another step towards expanding our swift and secure payment experience for more frequent transactions,” said Sudeep Tandon, chief business officer, FreeCharge. In January 2017, Jasper Infotech Pvt Ltd, which runs e-commerce firm Snapdeal, had put in close to Rs 390 crore ($57 million) in FreeCharge. Over the past several months, FreeCharge has been in the news for its fundraising efforts. In December 2016, a media report said that the company is in talks with global online payments company PayPal to sell around 25% of its stake for about $200 million. In October last year, SoftBank was reportedly in talks to invest in FreeCharge. In August 2016, VCCircle reported that Chinese Internet giant Tencent was evaluating a proposal to invest $150 million in FreeCharge. Like this report?

Ko Ye Lin Wai, an authorized developer for Google in Myanmar, also pledged at a tech development conference earlier this month to fix weaknesses in Google’s Maps and Translate services that have bugged users in Myanmar. Under financial sanctions, Singapore became a hub of outbound money for Myanmar developers selling their products on the platform, but accessing other parts of the global financial market remained a challenge. “We have so many constraints for money transfers when we sell our products on e-commerce websites like Play Store,” Ko Ye Lin Wai told Myanmar Business Today. “Now sanctions on Myanmar have been lifted, cooperation between banks for outbound money transfers will make the development of IT-related businesses easier,” he added.  Payment restrictions have been a major barrier for Myanmar IT product makers hoping to break into the international market, but the end of sanctions will solve this problem. And as internet penetration continues to explode it is expected more app developers will enter the market.  Ko Ye Lin Wai added that the push for e-government could benefit IT developers, as it will encourage standardization, especially in the use of fonts.  “E-government is not just about setting up websites. It’s about reducing paper, increasing online services and speeding up processes,” he said. “We have to upgrade the coding to improve e-government in line with international norms. We have to use Unicode as a common font. That makes sense for sustainability.” Making Unicode the standard will foster local tech innovation and help to penetrate international markets, he added, while also improving the Myanmar language version of Google’s search engine. He also admitted that Google’s services for Myanmar still “have weaknesses”. Google Translate commonly gets basic words and phrases wrong and Maps is often incomplete or inaccurate. “We have already noticed that Google’s translation and mapping services still have weaknesses for users, not only in Myanmar but also in other countries they have these kinds of errors,” he said. “Google Translate has only been in Myanmar for two years. Any feedback is welcome, we will adapt and fix the weaknesses based on suggestions from users,” he added.  Comments Archive Volume 5 Issue 3 Vol.5, Issue.2 Previous Issues SUBSCRIBE FACEBOOK Created by Myanmar Business Today SOCIAL SCENES TAGS scania techology interview avocado monarchy Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej chaos snack YRTA Union Pay Pepsi corrupt Coke cola unethical TrueMoney Samsung Note 7 Samsung Tab A water taxi Chauk smoking cancer Moe Kyaw teacher TYF HP acid attack David Lazar low cost house.com.mm AccorHotels Industrial City Kyaikhtiyo publisher revenge porn Intermach KBZ Group treasury GL feed De Heus Vios Oyster KMD Zika AIIB Jereh Shinhan Bank litter University of Information Technology in Yangon My Fish CHDB homeless traveller MOST READ Thai Floods May Cost Up to $3.4bn If They Last For Three Months - Chamber of Commerce 23 Jan 2017 Four Countries Plan Agribusiness Partnerships With Myanmar 23 Jan 2017 Ayeyarwaddy Should Be ‘Secondary Hub’ to Foster Economic Growth Beyond Cities - Industrial Zone Chairman 23 Jan 2017 © 2017 Myanmar Business Today.

Maybe even too many, in certain (ahem) cases. Amidst all the obvious titles and oddly overlapping offerings, though, Google's wing of the Play Store holds some genuinely useful treasures -- clever creations by the creator of Android that are just waiting to be discovered. Here are eight off-the-beaten-path Google apps that'll help you do all sorts of interesting things with your Android device. And yes, they're all free. (Some, but not all, are also available for iOS.) 1. Google Handwriting Input Ever feel like scribbling something out on your smartphone's display? Google Handwriting Input gives you a blank slate for writing -- with your finger or a stylus -- and then converts your illegible chicken scratch into actual sendable text. It works surprisingly well, and it can even handle emojis (if you for some reason are inspired to draw those). jr The best part about Handwriting Input is that it works, erm, hand-in-hand with Google's regular, fully-featured Gboard keyboard: Once you install and activate the app on your phone, you'll see a new globe-like icon in Gboard's bottom row. All you've gotta do is tap it to toggle back and forth between regular QWERTY typing and your new handwriting input option. 2. Trusted Contacts This so-new-it-still-has-that-new-app-smell tool is one of those things that's so practical, you'll wonder why your phone hasn't always had it. Trusted Contacts lets you establish location-sharing relationships with your friends, family members, or anyone else you know and love (or maybe just kinda-sorta like). Once both people have installed the app and approved the relationship, either person has the ability to request the other's location at any time. If the recipient doesn't respond after five minutes, his last known location will automatically be sent. And it works even if his phone is off or out of range. Peace of mind has never been easier. [ To comment on this story, visit JR's Google+ page. ] 3. Google Trips Organizing travel can be a pain -- but if you're already using Gmail, Google's new-ish Google Trips app makes everything super simple. Trips automatically finds and imports all your travel info as it arrives in your inbox -- travel reservations, hotel reservations, and any other related confirmations -- and bundles it all together into neatly organized trip-based portfolios. It even adds in extra little goodies like suggestions for nearby attractions, popular (and customizable) day plans, and restaurant recommendations. jr Oh -- and once your data's pulled over, everything works offline. 4. Google Arts & Culture Hang onto this one for your next dull or dreary day: Google Arts & Culture lets you explore national parks and monuments, zoom up close into famous works of art, and even take virtual tours of entire museums right from your mobile device. jr The app is just jam-packed with cool views of fascinating things from around the world, and it's something you really have to experience for yourself. (Bonus: If VR is your cup of tea, there's a separate VR version of the app that works with compatible headsets.) 5. Chrome Remote Desktop Chrome Remote Desktop is one of Google's most powerful cross-platforms tools -- and yet it doesn't get nearly enough attention. The app makes it dead-simple to remotely access any desktop computer from your Android phone. All you do is install the companion desktop Chrome extension, set up a PIN, and that's it: You can pull up your desktop on demand and access files, open programs, or do anything else you need from the palm of your hand. 6. Google Opinion Rewards I've mentioned Opinion Rewards several times over the years, but it's still something most typical users aren't aware of. If you're among those not yet using it, start now -- because it's basically just a way to get free Google Play Store credit for taking the occasional quick survey. The app will notify you whenever a new survey's available. You answer a handful of questions about a recent shopping experience or your thoughts on some type of merchandise, and then the app puts a credit on your Play Store account. It might be for 10 cents or it might be for a dollar. Either way, it takes practically no time to do, and the credits add up fast -- meaning your next app purchase or movie rental can be on the house. 7. Android Auto Google revamped its Android Auto app a few months ago and made it into something anyone who drives should have standing by. The new Auto app is basically a "car mode" for your phone -- an interface that's optimized for driving, with large buttons for commonly used commands and simplified access to the sort of stuff you might need while behind the wheel. (And yes, longtime Android fans, that should sound familiar.) jr 8. Wallpapers This last selection is actually the app that controls wallpaper-picking for Google's new Pixel phone -- but if you have any other device, you can think of it as an upgrade to your system's built-in wallpaper picker. The aptly named Wallpapers makes finding a background for your home screen a fun adventure, with options for selecting stunning images from sources like Google Earth or the photographer-favored galleries of Google+. The best part is that all of Wallpapers' categories -- Earth, Landscapes, Cityscapes, and so on -- include a "Daily wallpaper" option that'll automatically change your background to a different purty image every single day. jr My, oh my, things are suddenly lookin' good.

As reported by Zero Hedge, Scott Spencer, the director of product management for sustainable ads at Google, wrote in a blog post on Wednesday that the company has banned 200 publishers from accessing the AdSense advertising service because they (supposedly) post fake news stories. Google said it had cracked down on sites that contained ads for: illegal products; misleading advertisements; bad ads on mobile; ads that it determined were attempting to cheat the system; and promoting and profiting from bad sites. That said, the emphasis for the action was on the “fake news” category, which of course has been a dominant narrative of the angry Left since Clinton lost her second bid for the White House. (RELATED: Find out all the news that Google and others don’t want you to see at Censored.news) “In 2016, we saw the rise of tabloid cloakers, a new type of scammer that tries to game our system by pretending to be news,” Spencer wrote. “Cloakers often take advantage of timely topics—a government election, a trending news story or a popular celebrity—and their ads can look like headlines on a news website. But when people click on that story about Ellen DeGeneres and aliens, they go to a site selling weight-loss products, not a news story.” Okay, fair enough. But there’s more, and as always, the devil is in the details. “We’ve had long-standing policies prohibiting AdSense publishers from running ads on sites that help people deceive others, like a site where you buy fake diplomas or plagiarized term papers,” Spencer continued. “In November, we expanded on these policies, introducing a new AdSense misrepresentative content policy, that helps us to take action against website owners misrepresenting who they are and that deceive people with their content.” Are you beginning to get the picture? And this change, right after the November elections, no doubt? As Zero Hedge and others have noted, Google, Facebook and Yahoo were heavily criticized by the angry Left, which accused the social media sites of publishing phony news, by which they meant news not from “trusted sources” like the Washington establishment media (Washington Post, CNN, New York Times, Politico, etc.). “From November to December 2016, we reviewed 550 sites that were suspected of misrepresenting content to users, including impersonating news organizations,” Spencer wrote. “We took action against 340 of them for violating our policies, both misrepresentation and other offenses, and nearly 200 publishers were kicked out of our network permanently.” [Emphasis added] Thus far, the company has not identified those 200 publishers. Granted, there have been occasions where “fake news” has made it atop Google’s News Feed, which is some pretty valuable real estate on the Internet, including a story that claimed Trump actually won the popular vote (he didn’t; but all of Clinton’s popular vote advantage came from one state, California). But there have been plenty of fake news stories published by the very same establishment media that Google would never dream of banning, even though stories from those publishers are often at the top of the news feed. Examples of some recent fake news stories by the “mainstream media” include: — The Russians did it – The Washington Post: The paper mainstreamed the narrative that “The Russians Hacked the Election” with a shoddy piece of journalism reporting that Russian intelligence gave hundreds of alternative media sites (including ours) “propaganda” in the form of “news” aimed at helping Trump and hurting Clinton. (Playing her role, Clinton would later blame it on some grudge Russian President Vladimir Putin held against her.) — Trump told his supporters to vote multiple times – CNN: Like him or not, there is no doubt that the MSM did its best to destroy Trump during the campaign, and that, of course, included ginning up fake news. CNN was, of course, in the thick of that. As Mediaite reported, the bottom-feeder “news” network made up a claim that Trump told his supporters to commit voter fraud by voting early and often. In fact, Trump was lamenting that, “If you go to university center, they’ll give you a new ballot, they’ll void your old ballot. They’ll give you a new ballot, and you can go out and make sure it get’s in. Now in some places, they do that four or five times, but we don’t do that. So by tomorrow, almost everyone will have their new ballots in.” See scores more of them here. (RELATED: What is the mainstream media attempting to lie about today?

(Reuters/Dado Ruvic) Share Written by Dave Gershgorn Obsession Machines with Brains January 25, 2017 They’ll be some of the weirder selfies you’ve ever taken, but a study using artificial intelligence to analyze images of skin lesions suggests that smartphones may soon help humans detect skin cancer. Published today in Nature, the study began with an unremarkable image-recognition network provided by Google, pre-trained to identify objects in images. Led by Stanford professor and former Google exec Sebastian Thrun, researchers showed the AI thousands and thousands of medical images—129,450 from Stanford University Medical Center and 18 open-source repositories, to be exact—which are labeled to tell the machine what it’s looking at. After looking at hundreds of images of a specific lesion, the AI begins to understand similarities between the images. The algorithm learns to differentiate lesions from healthy skin, potentially based on traits like coloration and contrast. As it sees more images, it can draw more accurate conclusions about benign, malignant, and non-neoplastic lesions. (Non-neoplastic lesions could be inflammation.) With this technology, people around the world could have access to low-cost screening for skin cancer, the most common form of the disease. How does the algorithm stack up against human dermatologists? For the most part, quite well. In one trial that pitted the AI against two dermatologists to determine whether a lesion was benign, malignant, or non-neoplastic, the algorithm scored 71% accuracy against the humans’ respective 66% and 65% scores. The algorithm also outperformed humans in a separate trial involving 21 dermatologists. In another test, the team tasked the algorithm with looking at a lesion image and deciding whether to treat it or reassure the patient that it would be OK. The algorithm proved slightly more accurate than most doctors, only underperforming in two shown scenarios. There is a crucial caveat though: The Nature paper does not mention skin color, and all of the examples shown feature people of lighter skin color. Dark skin has traditionally confounded machine-learning engineers; algorithms have labeled black people as gorillas, and AI-based evaluations of beauty favor whites. Until researchers train the algorithm to work on people with darker skin (by showing it more examples of lesions on darker skin) the algorithm is only useful for a segment of the global population. For now, the Stanford team’s algorithm only runs on full computers, but they’re interested in pursuing a smartphone app. “Everyone will have a supercomputer in their pockets with a number of sensors in it, including a camera,” Andre Esteva, co-lead author of the paper, told Stanford News Service. “What if we could use it to visually screen for skin cancer? Or other ailments?” Most Popular Philosopher Slavoj Žižek settles the “Is it OK to punch a Nazi?” question once and for all Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search Post to Cancel
