[Continuously updated] April Fools' Roundup: All the jokes from around the web Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/01 7:24pm PDTApr 1, 2017 15 Plus 1 on G+ 71 Share on Facebook 86 Share on Twitter Total Shares172 Google News NVIDIA Samsung T-Mobile Videos Article Contents 1 Google Gnome 2 Mrs. Pac-Man in Google Maps 3 Google's Bubble Wrap Keyboard 4 Google Assistant 5 Google Wind 6 Netflix Live 7 T-Mobile ONEsie 8 Hulu Hu 9 OnePlus Dash drink 10 Lyft Mono 11 Honor BFF 12 Google Haptic Helpers 13 Amazon Petlexa 14 Contour by SlickWraps 15 Nvidia GTX G-Assist 16 Google's data center on Mars 17 LineageOS' mascot 18 Chromebook accessories 19 Exynos Yoga Processor 20 Carved screen protector 21 I'm Feeling Woof/I'm Feeling Meow 22 Waze maps for Mars 23 JerryRigEverything's NoPhone video 24 Google Translate for Heptapod B 25 Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s 26 MKBHD's Nokia 3310 review 27 Open GApps Femto April Fools Day is almost upon us, but some companies aren't waiting to share their pranks. Google always does a great job, from the Pokemon Google Maps overlay to a smart mailbox, but there are a few from other companies worth mentioning. Here's a rundown of all the hillarious (or strange) tech-related April Fools Day jokes from around the web. Google Gnome One of Google's product launches from last year was the Google Home, a $129 smart speaker with Google Assistant. Now the company is teasing the "Google Gnome," an outside version of the Home. You can ask it weather questions, let it control your lawnmower and other tools, and even dress it up in accessories. The Google Gnome has a page on the Google Store, but unfortunately you can't buy it. I really want a rain coat for my Google Home, though. Mrs. Pac-Man in Google Maps For April Fools' 2015, Google added Pac-Man into Google Maps and Ingress. This year, Mrs Pac-Man is invading Google Maps. For regions of the world already on April 1st, a new Mrs. Pac-Man button is visible on the mobile app. You then have to control Mrs. Pac-Man on real-life streets, and of course, outrun the Ghosts. Google's Bubble Wrap Keyboard (English subtitles are available) Google Japan's prank is pretty funny - it's a bubble wrap keyboard. The idea is to pop bubbles on a bubble wrap sheet to form words, then feed the sheet through a reader to send the message. Some of the bubble wrap sheets are even scented. Google Assistant Google has plenty of Easter Eggs in Google Assistant, and as you might expect, there's one for April Fools' Day too. When asked, Assistant will offer advice on how not to get pranked, such as "If something seems too good to be true today, it probably is." Google Wind Google's Netherlands division has its own April Fools' Day gag, named 'Google Wind.' The idea is to use machine learning to control the weather, using Holland's famous windmills. I'll admit, this one is pretty great. Netflix Live Will Arnet has been in plenty of Netflix original content, from BoJack Horseman to A Series of Unfortunate Events. For April Fools' Day, Netflix is proud to share 'Netflix Live', which is nearly an hour of Arnett commentating ordinary events like toasting bread and completing a crossword puzzle. It's actually funnier than it sounds. You can watch the full thing here (a Netflix subscription is required). T-Mobile ONEsie T-Mobile's prank is a onesie, with "full-body coverage" and a built-in 4G LTE hotspot. You can actually buy it for $40, but the real one doesn't have any tech inside it. Hulu Hu With the claim that the human attention span has "dropped to eight seconds," Hulu has released 'Hu.' It's just a library of short clips from existing Hulu content, and you actually need an account to see them. This is probably the lamest April Fools' Day gag in the list - better luck next year, guys. OnePlus Dash drink OnePlus is really proud of its Dash Charge feature, even to the point of enlisting celebrities to talk about it. For April Fools', the company made real Dash Charge energy drinks. You can find our review of the drink here. Lyft Mono For April Fools' Day, Lyft has announced the 'Lyft Mono.' It's a wearable glove, vaguely resembling a Nintendo Power Glove. This gag is actually real, and once you put it on and get the app, sticking out your thumb will hail a Lyft cab. You can sign up to for a chance to get one here. Honor BFF We all need some positive reinforcement every now and then, right? Honor thinks so, and created the Honor BFF. This imaginary phone uses machine learning to periodically give you compliments and motivation. Hopefully it ships with Android 7.1 Nougat. Google Haptic Helpers This is probably my favorite gag so far. In order to create a more realistic virtual reality experience, you can schedule a "haptic helper" to come to your house and help create a more realistic environment. Just watch the video, it's hilarious. Amazon Petlexa Alexa is cool and all, but your furry friends need one too. As the name implies, Petlexa is Alexa for your pets. Contour by SlickWraps Putting a skin on your phone or tablet is too much work. For April Fool's Day, Slickwraps is teasing the 'Countour' - a machine that sprays on device skins. Frankly, I'm not sure if this is actually real or not, but there is a page for it on SlickWrap's store. Nvidia GTX G-Assist How many times have you been playing an online game, only to be interrupted by someone in real life? NVIDIA has made the 'G Assist,' a flash drive that can take over for you if you're busy. It can also help you beat boss battles, and provides periodic reminders to consume energy drinks. More information and a video can be found here. Google's data center on Mars If you have important data, you need a backup. That's why Google announced its first interplanetary data center, named "Ziggy Stardust," on the Google Cloud Platform Blog today. Located in the Gale Crater on Mars, it will store a cache of data from Earth to prevent irrecoverable loss when a planetary disaster strikes. Google hopes to finish the data center by 2018. LineageOS' mascot CyanogenMod's mascot, Cid, was one of the most recognizable icons in the Android community. As the spiritual successor to CyanogenMod, LineageOS has created its own mascot - 'Ink'. The project also announced 'Br0zip,' an artificial intelligence that can port LineageOS to any device in no time at all. Chromebook accessories Even though most Chromebooks can now run Android apps, you still can't use your Chromebook like an Android phone/tablet for all use cases. Until now, that is. Google has announced a Chromebook Groupie Stick (seen above), a Chromebook Cardboard headset, and a Chromebook armband. See the company's blog post for more info. Exynos Yoga Processor Remember when curved phones were a thing? Maybe we'll see more in the coming months, because Samsung has just unveiled the Exynos Yoga Processor - the first flexible mobile SoC. Anyone up for a Galaxy Flex? Carved screen protector Carved is a small Indiana-based phone case company, but now they are working on a wooden screen protector. Why hasn't this been done before? I'll take ten. I'm Feeling Woof/I'm Feeling Meow By force-touching the Google app icon in iOS, you can select "I'm Feeling Woof" or "I'm Feeling Meow." These give your pets access to the stuff they care about - from dog food to balls of yarn. More info can be found on Google's blog post. Waze maps for Mars According to the company's blog, Waze is has begun to map the surface of Mars. Certain members of the Waze community will also be sent to the Red Planet to more accurately map the surface. JerryRigEverything's NoPhone video If you haven't heard about it, the NoPhone is a solid piece of plastic designed to simulate the feeling of a phone in your pocket. I'm not really sure if anyone uses it, but JerryRigEverything is happy to break it just as much as any other phone. Google Translate for Heptapod B Using machine learning, Google Translate can now decrypt messages written in Heptapod B - the language from the film Arrival. On an unrelated note, it looks like someone from Google is still rocking a Nexus 10. See Google's blog post for more info. Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s ASUS has an April Fools gag too - the Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s Veritas Blue Limited Special Edition. I would probably buy this phone. MKBHD's Nokia 3310 review You may have heard about the updated Nokia 3310, but it turns out the original is an amazing smartphone. Okay, maybe not, but the video is pretty funny. Open GApps Femto Do you need to flash the latest Gapps package on your device, but you don't have a stable network connection? Not to worry, the Open GApps Femto package is here to help. It uses the United States HAARP service (which is not real, but just pretend) to download the latest GApps package. You can find more info at the GApps blog.   That concludes our coverage of April Fools' Day in the tech world. Let us know in the comments below which gag you liked the most!

Greg Abbott https://kodi.tv/ Sergio Carmona Scariest one... seriously... Artem Russakovskii Not even a 503 or something? Just a 200? Ballsy re: SEO. SickoPsycho oops- beat me to it. Yeah they actuqally had me going until I compared a whois of kodi.tv vs kickasstorrents.com, a site that actually was seized. The whois data would show that it is not official. Derik Taylor So this is one I find interesting. Could it technically be a criminal offense to falsify a domain seizure? How would that work? mondeca I hope every year that Google will announce something real and awesome on April Fools' Day, like they did with Gmail. Once again, I am disappointed. JG It isn't technically April Fools Day yet... Least not in the US... Jordan Introducing the Boeing Dreambird 1417 https://www.facebook.com/virginatlantic/videos/10155188765647679/ andyy Corbin, the last one (SlickWraps) isn't embedded properly Artem Russakovskii Thanks, fixed it. BatJake Will Arnett sounds like Michael Keaton. Corbin Davenport And they both have played Batman. Peterson Silva "Frankly, I'm not sure if this is actually real or not" Well then THAT ought to be the best one! Trooper311 Gimme dat gnome yo. abqnm The Google Haptic Helpers was OK, until they applied the "I Voted!" sticker to the guy's shirt. I was laughing and crying at the same time. Corbin Davenport Yep, that had me laughing too. AdrianFDiratama . How about JG I'd actually like to see Google produce the Google Gnome.... All they'd need to do is add a battery (and Qi charging) to a Google Home and stick it in a new Gnome shell... Make sure its IP68 and maybe even MIL-STD-810G certified. It'd be a fun little gadget to put on the picnic table of your next summer back yard get together. Pump out some tunes, order pizza & Ubers for everyone to go home in, etc... Or take out when you work in the garden & don't want to get your phone dirty... Maybe even produce one with an LTE radio (and GPS). Then you could take it out of WiFi range camping. Wake up and find him chilling next to your tent in his little chair "Hey Google, how's today's weather? When does the rafting place open? How far away from the camp site is it?" cdotlawrence Maybe like a more customizable (from a looks standpoint), durable, & usable-on-go version of Home? Google Home Pro/Ultra? Interesting idea, but not sure why you wouldn't do most of the things it would do on your phone. Some specific use cases like you mentioned but beyond those, idk. Guess it'd be a highly functional, portable, durable and customizable speaker? Suicide_Note Ms. Pac-Man in Maps is live for me here in the US, even though it isn't April 1st yet. Daishi No Clarity Speaker??? Artem Russakovskii Why would that be in this post? Urmil Shroff What if we actually get the Mars data center many years from now? Eumelanin Knight I love this day. I just wish everyone kept up the pranks for the entire month like I do. Oddly enough.. I usually have less friends in May than I started with in April. How curious. Not sure why I brought that up. Totally unrelated. Josh Ewing VortexHornady Bullet-Cam https://youtu.be/hoGRlS53U_k Courtney King Google is so adorkable. JD It used to be funny when Google did April fools stunts but now I just get upset because I think of all the broken crap they need to fix but instead they're busy with April fools trash.

Bixby — introduced at Samsung’s unveiling of Galaxy S8 smartphones — aims to help the South Korean giant break into a surging market for voice-activated virtual assistants, which includes Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, Google’s Assistant and Microsoft’s Cortana. The latest personal digital assistant distinguishes itself from competitors by using voice commands rather than touch to control handsets or applications, factoring in location awareness and image recognition. The integrated camera function allows users to identify buildings, such as popular tourist sites, to access their websites and other information simply by snapping a photo. The photo recognition technology can also help users decipher menus in foreign languages, or find places to shop for specific items they photograph. “It impressed me that they were doing image recognition and context awareness,” said Bob O’Donnell, analyst and consultant with Technalysis Research, who attended the presentation. “It adds some new twists we haven’t seen before,” he said, noting Bixby’s ability to make recommendations. Yet Bixby is still a work in progress — the virtual entity did not speak at the New York demonstration. It has yet to be infused with technology from Samsung’s recently acquired Viv, a company founded by creators of Apple’s Siri. “It’s not talking yet,” O’Donnell said. “They have room to expand and grow.” Bixby will face competition from established players — even from Samsung’s own phones, where users can choose to use Assistant, Cortana or Alexa. Richard Windsor, an independent analyst who writes the Radio Free Mobile blog, said Bixby may face problems because the “best-in-class Google Assistant” will be on the home button of the new phone, which is powered by Google-backed Android software. That means Bixby has a “fearsome competitor” on its own flagship device, according to the analyst. “Bixby is trying to do things a little differently but careful assessment of what Samsung demonstrated shows a service that has very little intelligence at all,” Windsor said. Roger Kay of Endpoint Technologies Associates said Bixby might face challenges catching up with its rivals, which have been deployed for some time. “You can’t build these things overnight,” Kay said. “It would take years to create something as developed as Siri.” Still, he noted, it is important for Samsung to be in the game. “These are table stakes,” Kay said. “You can’t not deal with voice. It’s hands-free and can summarize a lot of things quickly.” Amazon appears to have impacted the sector the most with its connected speakers using Alexa. The service allows users a wide range of voice interactions for music, news, purchases and connects with smart home devices. “Alexa is the top dog,” Kay said. “Amazon has done the best work from a commercial perspective. They took it out of the theoretical to put it to work for things people want to do.” AFP Publish date: April 2, 2017 10:25 am| Modified date: April 2, 2017 10:25 am Tags: Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, Bixby virtual assistant, Bixby.

Samsung’s Bixby lays the groundwork for the company’s smart home play Posted Mar 29, 2017 by Brian Heater (@bheater) 0 SHARES Next Story Samsung adds a controller to the Gear VR, will bundle both with Galaxy S8 pre-orders The Galaxy S8’s main selling point still isn’t fully formed. Announced the week leading up to today’s main event, Bixby is as much a key building block for the company moving forward as it is a shiny new piece of a flagship phone. The company is finally ready to make its play for the smart home, and the new messenger is going to be a key component. Consider this: The company hasn’t been nearly as aggressive in its bid to provide a unifying presence for connected-home devices. Sure, the company picked up SmartThings back in 2014, but the Kickstarter-funded company hasn’t promoted the technology with the same push as Amazon’s Echo or Apple’s HomeKit, even as interest in the technology has skyrocket. Strange, given the fact that it has the pieces to make a uniquely appealing play in a sea of like-minded solutions. After all, Samsung’s got something that Apple, Google and Amazon don’t: its own line of connected-home devices, from smart fridges to robotic vacuums. This week at Unpacked, the company is showcasing some key steps toward unification. In discussing the unveiling, the company has made mention of its “overall ecosystem strategy,” tied together through Bixby Home. The assistant will provide a centralized location akin to Apple Home, wherein users can control and monitor connected devices and set automated multiple smart home behaviors based on things like user proximity or time of day, similar to what Apple offers with Scenes. It’s clear, of course, that the Galaxy S8 is just the first step in Bixby’s growth. It likely won’t be long before the assistant rolls out to the rest of the company’s myriad device categories, starting with the a new router that was also announced at today’s event. Samsung’s growing home router play (which includes a number of 5G devices unveiled at MWC), is one speaker and integrated smart assistant away from taking on Echo and Google Home. Don’t be surprised if the company launches one of these devices by year’s end. Even if Samsung for some reason fails to make good on that promise, the company again has plenty of devices in the wild to lean on. Apple has already made it clear that the Apple TV is going to be a centerpiece of the company’s connected-home strategy. In lieu of a low-priced Echo-like device, the set-top box is the closest the company has to an always-on connect product that can serve as a smart-home hub. Samsung, for its part, has already announced that it’s going all-in on connected sets, giving all sets some level of smartness, moving forward. That’s a tremendous potential install base for the company. Pair that with all of the company’s connected washers and driers, refrigerators and the like, and we’re talking a large population of users who may have already opted into the company’s larger smart-home play without knowing it. It’s for this reason Samsung’s decision to build its own Smart Assistant makes perfect sense. Sure, on mobile Bixby feels like another me-too play as Siri and Alexa are already battling it out for Android users, but Samsung’s move is much larger, and like Amazon’s low-cost Echo, the company has been laying the groundwork all along. That means that, while Bixby is late to the party, adoption should be simple for anyone with a Galaxy device and connected Samsung home product. The company has been laying the groundwork for a larger product ecosystem, and if things go according to plan, the company’s new home assistant will be the thing that connects those dots. Of course, Bixby has to actually make it out into the world. And like Google’s Assistant, the platform’s success will depend in part on how many mobile devices it makes it on to. It was Google’s somewhat delayed roll out that helped open the door for Amazon’s Alexa play on mobile. The S8 and S8+ will launch with the virtual assistant, and certainly the next Note device and any flagship tablets from the company. But in order to make Bixby the ubiquitous language the company is hoping for, it’s going to have to extend beyond even Samsung devices. The company will need to bring its assistant to the Google Play — and dare I say it — Apple App stores. One of the key problems these assistants are working to solve is the creation of a unified, cross-device hub, rather than separate logins for each individual smart-home component. As such, the company will need to ensure that Bixby is integrated with as many devices as possible. The company’s stated third-party support for apps will be a big piece of that puzzle, but opening up the assistant to more mobile platforms will be a solid way to help loop people in to the assistant and overcome the company’s late start to the party. Still, the company will, at the very least, have a unique entry into the ever-escalating fight for the smart home. Like Apple, Amazon and Google, the company has found its own way into the space. And in some respects, Samsung may actually have the strongest potential foundation for a killer smart-home play, between Smart Things and a wide range of connected home appliances. Bixby might be hampered by a late arrival out of the gate, but if the company plays its cards right and delivers some truly seamless integration across devices, it may have hope for uniting the smart home after all. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Samsung Electronics Founded 1969 Overview Samsung Electronics is a South Korean multinational electronics company engaged in consumer electronics, information technology and mobile communications, and device solutions businesses worldwide.

"It impressed me that they were doing image recognition and context awareness," said Bob O'Donnell, analyst and consultant with Technalysis Research, who attended the presentation. "It adds some new twists we haven't seen before," he said, noting Bixby's ability to make recommendations. Yet Bixby is still a work in progress -- the virtual entity did not speak at the New York demonstration.

Now in an announcement by Logitech, it seems that if you own the company’s Harmony devices like the Harmony Elite, Harmony Companion, or the Harmony Hub, it will work with Google Home and Google Assistant. This means that using your voice, you will be able to get Google Home/Assistant to do certain Harmony-specific tasks. According to Logitech, “Any Logitech Harmony hub-based product including Harmony Elite, Harmony Companion, and Harmony Hub works with the Google Assistant on Google Home by allowing you to easily power on the TV, control the volume, or change channels simply by using your voice. You can also activate your favorite Harmony activity, turn on smart lighting, or control up to 270,000 other devices supported by the Logitech Harmony platform.” Some examples include turning on your TV to a specific channel, or adjusting the volume, or adjust and control your smart lighting system like the Philips Hue system. If you’d like more details on the features and how to set it up, head on over to Logitech’s website. Filed in Gadgets >Home. Read more about Google, google assistant, google home and Logitech.

Google always does a great job, from the Pokemon Google Maps overlay to a smart mailbox, but there are a few from other companies worth mentioning. Here's a rundown of all the hillarious (or strange) tech-related April Fools Day jokes from around the web. Google Gnome One of Google's product launches from last year was the Google Home, a $129 smart speaker with Google Assistant. Now the company is teasing the "Google Gnome," an outside version of the Home. You can ask it weather questions, let it control your lawnmower and other tools, and even dress it up in accessories. The Google Gnome has a page on the Google Store, but unfortunately you can't buy it. I really want a rain coat for my Google Home, though. Mrs. Pac-Man in Google Maps For April Fools' 2015, Google added Pac-Man into Google Maps and Ingress. This year, Mrs Pac-Man is invading Google Maps. For regions of the world already on April 1st, a new Mrs. Pac-Man button is visible on the mobile app. You then have to control Mrs. Pac-Man on real-life streets, and of course, outrun the Ghosts. Google's Bubble Wrap Keyboard (English subtitles are available) Google Japan's prank is pretty funny - it's a bubble wrap keyboard. The idea is to pop bubbles on a bubble wrap sheet to form words, then feed the sheet through a reader to send the message. Some of the bubble wrap sheets are even scented. Google Assistant Google has plenty of Easter Eggs in Google Assistant, and as you might expect, there's one for April Fools' Day too. When asked, Assistant will offer advice on how not to get pranked, such as "If something seems too good to be true today, it probably is." Google Wind Google's Netherlands division has its own April Fools' Day gag, named 'Google Wind.' The idea is to use machine learning to control the weather, using Holland's famous windmills. I'll admit, this one is pretty great. Netflix Live Will Arnet has been in plenty of Netflix original content, from BoJack Horseman to A Series of Unfortunate Events. For April Fools' Day, Netflix is proud to share 'Netflix Live', which is nearly an hour of Arnett commentating ordinary events like toasting bread and completing a crossword puzzle. It's actually funnier than it sounds. You can watch the full thing here (a Netflix subscription is required). T-Mobile ONEsie T-Mobile's prank is a onesie, with "full-body coverage" and a built-in 4G LTE hotspot. You can actually buy it for $40, but the real one doesn't have any tech inside it. Hulu Hu With the claim that the human attention span has "dropped to eight seconds," Hulu has released 'Hu.' It's just a library of short clips from existing Hulu content, and you actually need an account to see them. This is probably the lamest April Fools' Day gag in the list - better luck next year, guys. OnePlus Dash drink OnePlus is really proud of its Dash Charge feature, even to the point of enlisting celebrities to talk about it. For April Fools', the company made real Dash Charge energy drinks. You can find our review of the drink here. Lyft Mono For April Fools' Day, Lyft has announced the 'Lyft Mono.' It's a wearable glove, vaguely resembling a Nintendo Power Glove. This gag is actually real, and once you put it on and get the app, sticking out your thumb will hail a Lyft cab. You can sign up to for a chance to get one here. Honor BFF We all need some positive reinforcement every now and then, right? Honor thinks so, and created the Honor BFF. This imaginary phone uses machine learning to periodically give you compliments and motivation. Hopefully it ships with Android 7.1 Nougat. Google Haptic Helpers This is probably my favorite gag so far. In order to create a more realistic virtual reality experience, you can schedule a "haptic helper" to come to your house and help create a more realistic environment. Just watch the video, it's hilarious. Amazon Petlexa Alexa is cool and all, but your furry friends need one too. As the name implies, Petlexa is Alexa for your pets. Contour by SlickWraps Putting a skin on your phone or tablet is too much work. For April Fool's Day, Slickwraps is teasing the 'Countour' - a machine that sprays on device skins. Frankly, I'm not sure if this is actually real or not, but there is a page for it on SlickWrap's store. Nvidia GTX G-Assist How many times have you been playing an online game, only to be interrupted by someone in real life? NVIDIA has made the 'G Assist,' a flash drive that can take over for you if you're busy. It can also help you beat boss battles, and provides periodic reminders to consume energy drinks. More information and a video can be found here. Google's data center on Mars If you have important data, you need a backup. That's why Google announced its first interplanetary data center, named "Ziggy Stardust," on the Google Cloud Platform Blog today. Located in the Gale Crater on Mars, it will store a cache of data from Earth to prevent irrecoverable loss when a planetary disaster strikes. Google hopes to finish the data center by 2018. LineageOS' mascot CyanogenMod's mascot, Cid, was one of the most recognizable icons in the Android community. As the spiritual successor to CyanogenMod, LineageOS has created its own mascot - 'Ink'. The project also announced 'Br0zip,' an artificial intelligence that can port LineageOS to any device in no time at all. Chromebook accessories Even though most Chromebooks can now run Android apps, you still can't use your Chromebook like an Android phone/tablet for all use cases. Until now, that is. Google has announced a Chromebook Groupie Stick (seen above), a Chromebook Cardboard headset, and a Chromebook armband. See the company's blog post for more info. Exynos Yoga Processor Remember when curved phones were a thing? Maybe we'll see more in the coming months, because Samsung has just unveiled the Exynos Yoga Processor - the first flexible mobile SoC. Anyone up for a Galaxy Flex? Carved screen protector Carved is a small Indiana-based phone case company, but now they are working on a wooden screen protector. Why hasn't this been done before? I'll take ten. I'm Feeling Woof/I'm Feeling Meow By force-touching the Google app icon in iOS, you can select "I'm Feeling Woof" or "I'm Feeling Meow." These give your pets access to the stuff they care about - from dog food to balls of yarn. More info can be found on Google's blog post. Waze maps for Mars According to the company's blog, Waze is has begun to map the surface of Mars. Certain members of the Waze community will also be sent to the Red Planet to more accurately map the surface. JerryRigEverything's NoPhone video If you haven't heard about it, the NoPhone is a solid piece of plastic designed to simulate the feeling of a phone in your pocket. I'm not really sure if anyone uses it, but JerryRigEverything is happy to break it just as much as any other phone. Google Translate for Heptapod B Using machine learning, Google Translate can now decrypt messages written in Heptapod B - the language from the film Arrival. On an unrelated note, it looks like someone from Google is still rocking a Nexus 10. See Google's blog post for more info. Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s ASUS has an April Fools gag too - the Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s Veritas Blue Limited Special Edition. I would probably buy this phone. MKBHD's Nokia 3310 review You may have heard about the updated Nokia 3310, but it turns out the original is an amazing smartphone. Okay, maybe not, but the video is pretty funny. Open GApps Femto Do you need to flash the latest Gapps package on your device, but you don't have a stable network connection? Not to worry, the Open GApps Femto package is here to help. It uses the United States HAARP service (which is not real, but just pretend) to download the latest GApps package. You can find more info at the GApps blog.   That concludes our coverage of April Fools' Day in the tech world. Let us know in the comments below which gag you liked the most!

Yeah they actuqally had me going until I compared a whois of kodi.tv vs kickasstorrents.com, a site that actually was seized. The whois data would show that it is not official. Derik Taylor So this is one I find interesting. Could it technically be a criminal offense to falsify a domain seizure? How would that work? mondeca I hope every year that Google will announce something real and awesome on April Fools' Day, like they did with Gmail. Once again, I am disappointed.

BatJake Will Arnett sounds like Michael Keaton. Corbin Davenport And they both have played Batman. Peterson Silva "Frankly, I'm not sure if this is actually real or not" Well then THAT ought to be the best one! Trooper311 Gimme dat gnome yo. abqnm The Google Haptic Helpers was OK, until they applied the "I Voted!" sticker to the guy's shirt. I was laughing and crying at the same time. Corbin Davenport Yep, that had me laughing too. AdrianFDiratama . How about JG I'd actually like to see Google produce the Google Gnome.... All they'd need to do is add a battery (and Qi charging) to a Google Home and stick it in a new Gnome shell... Make sure its IP68 and maybe even MIL-STD-810G certified. It'd be a fun little gadget to put on the picnic table of your next summer back yard get together. Pump out some tunes, order pizza & Ubers for everyone to go home in, etc... Or take out when you work in the garden & don't want to get your phone dirty... Maybe even produce one with an LTE radio (and GPS). Then you could take it out of WiFi range camping. Wake up and find him chilling next to your tent in his little chair "Hey Google, how's today's weather? When does the rafting place open? How far away from the camp site is it?" cdotlawrence Maybe like a more customizable (from a looks standpoint), durable, & usable-on-go version of Home? Google Home Pro/Ultra? Interesting idea, but not sure why you wouldn't do most of the things it would do on your phone. Some specific use cases like you mentioned but beyond those, idk. Guess it'd be a highly functional, portable, durable and customizable speaker? Suicide_Note Ms. Pac-Man in Maps is live for me here in the US, even though it isn't April 1st yet. Daishi No Clarity Speaker??? Artem Russakovskii Why would that be in this post? Urmil Shroff What if we actually get the Mars data center many years from now? Eumelanin Knight I love this day. I just wish everyone kept up the pranks for the entire month like I do. Oddly enough.. I usually have less friends in May than I started with in April. How curious. Not sure why I brought that up. Totally unrelated. Josh Ewing VortexHornady Bullet-Cam https://youtu.be/hoGRlS53U_k Courtney King Google is so adorkable.

Sections Deseret NewsUtah Utah Google Fiber installation moving at dial-up speeds in Salt Lake City By Art RaymondDeseret News Published: April 1, 2017 8:25 p.m. Updated: 4 hours ago + Leave a comment View 5 Items Jeffrey D. Allred, Deseret News Antonio Lenrmi does preparation work for Google Fiber on 2300 East and 2300 South in Sugar House on Tuesday, March 28, 2017. SALT LAKE CITY — A couple of springs ago, Google — amid much pomp and fanfare — announced that Salt Lake City had been distinguished from a long list of hopeful American cities to become recipients of Google Fiber service and that dizzying download speeds were just around the corner. The world's largest corporation also applied the gilding to the lily in promising that all would be accomplished completely at their expense. Now, just over two years later, progress on the project appears to be moving at dial-up speeds, with relatively few areas of the city enjoying active, Google Fiber service and a small number of residents feeling less than giddy about their interactions with the company. And the downside to the privately funded effort is that the company has zero obligation to keep residents informed about future installations, follow-through on promised scheduling or answer questions from the media. Google declined to provide specific information about how many Salt Lake residents currently have service, in what order the city's neighborhoods would be receiving service or how long it will take to complete the work of establishing access to Google Fiber service citywide. Last fall, Google made its second public splash, announcing that the major infrastructure "ring" had been completed and a section of downtown was fully wired and providing service to residents who signed up for it. The company also said it was prepared to move quickly to get the city's remaining neighborhoods connected and whetted residents' appetites with impressive public demonstrations of the power of fiber, like downloading a full-length HD movie in a matter of seconds. Sugar House Community Council Chairman Landon Clark said a Google representative visited a meeting of his council about a year before the announcement and indicated his neighborhood would be seeing service in the summer of 2016. "Obviously, they were far behind their hoped-for schedule," Clark said. "But while a lot of people have experienced some frustration with the delays, they've been working in our area for several weeks now and people are excited about getting hooked up to fiber service," he added. When asked for details about exactly where Google Fiber service is currently available to Salt Lake residents, a company spokesperson sent coordinates that mirrored the service area announced last fall and a statement that they were "actively constructing, signing up and providing service" in Sugar House. Clark said it seemed like a "pretty good section" of Sugar House's residential areas either had service or had seen recent signs of cabling activity. Rose Park While no active service appears to be currently available to Rose Park residents, there's been plenty of fiber-related activity in the area and, for some residents, just a bit too much installation action. David Parrott was happy to see signs of Google Fiber being installed in and around his Rose Park neighborhood last fall, shortly after the company's announcement of initial service to downtown residents. "It seems like the west side is usually last on the list to get the cool, new stuff that comes to Salt Lake City, so we were definitely excited to see that, for a change, we were going to be among the first (to get fiber service)," Parrott said. Later, that enthusiasm took a turn following an unexpected encounter between a subcontractor's underground drill and his residential water line. While a drilling crew was nearby, the running water in his house "just stopped." Parrott said the workers from Mile High Contracting acknowledged they had severed the water line, but when asked when they would be able to repair the damage, the contractor gave an unexpected response. "Google's subcontractor told us it wasn't their problem and that we should contact our home insurer," Parrott said. "We were really surprised and just thought, 'This is kind of weird.'" Parrott said he contacted HomeServe, the company through which they had supplemental insurance for their outside water line. "The company denied our claim and told us that they'd heard from other people with coverage in our area with similar issues," Parrott said. "And they said it was Google's responsibility." With no working water service and no one ready to take responsibility for the damage, Parrott said they turned to the city for help, contacting both their council representative and a person they knew in the mayor's office. That finally got the repair effort moving. "Someone from the city came out, and someone from Google came out and, eventually, the water line got fixed," Parrott said. At a Rose Park Community Council meeting held after the water line incident, Parrott said he spoke to the audience there, which included a Google representative. "I stood up and related the story of what we'd been through to the Google rep and my neighbors," said Parrott. "And I thought, 'All you have to do now is say we're sorry and it was our fault.'" That didn't happen, and it led Parrott to do some research to determine if their experience was an anomaly, or if there was more going on. "I looked up all the other communities where Google has been and a lot of them had the same treatment," said Parrott. "In every single municipality where they put Google Fiber, there are news stories about how badly the installation has gone." Tennessee's capital city, Nashville was about 15 months into its Google Fiber installation last fall, and according to a story published in November in The Tennessean, over 70 "utility strikes" had occurred, with an estimated damage value in excess of $260,000. The Salt Lake Public Utilities Department was asked about the total number of fiber installation-related utility strikes in Salt Lake City, but wasn't able to offer complete data in time for this story. District 1 Councilman James Rogers said he's heard from a few residents in his district who have had issues with property damage related to the Google Fiber installation effort, but it was his impression that the company was getting better at taking care of needed repairs. “Of course it’s unfortunate that it happened and I feel for those individuals that have had issues," Rogers said. "But, if we can get them resolved and everybody’s happy with how it’s fixed, I think in the long run it’s going to be a good thing for us.” Xmission founder and CEO Pete Ashdown has been a cautionary voice about Google Fiber coming to Salt Lake City since the company's debut announcement in 2015. He said he wasn't surprised that the installation job is behind schedule. "Installing fiber optic cable is fraught with peril," Ashdown said. "You can always count on it being expensive and you can always count on it taking longer than you ever think it will." Ashdown said he was surprised that Google wasn't more dialed-in on the process, considering its experience with other, so-called "Google Fiber cities" and the breadth of knowledge that's out there in the contracting community where fiber cable installation has been active since the 1990s. "You’d think a company with the resources of Google could be brash about getting out there and doing it quickly," Ashdown said. "They seem to be surprised at how much money it’s costing and how long it's taking, which is incredible because it’s (fiber cable installation) been going on for decades." And while Google will offer no estimate on when it might cross the fiber installation finish line in Salt Lake City, some sense of timeline may be gleaned from Kansas City. The company's first municipal fiber project was announced in 2011 with installation starting the following year. The city has about three times the population of Salt Lake City and, as of now, some Kansas City residents are still awaiting fiber service in their neighborhoods. Positive reviews While the road to fiber installation in Salt Lake City has been bumpy, reviews from those who have the service are very positive. Downtown Community Council Chairman D. Christian Harrison signed up for the 100 megabit-per-second service (fast enough to download a full-length HD movie in about 6 minutes, according to Google) and said he couldn't be happier with the experience. "I signed up immediately and was in the first wave of folks who got service," Harrison said. "The installation went smoothly and suddenly I had speeds far faster than I've ever had." He did offer one minor caveat about the "box" that is installed in customer homes who sign up for the service. "Really, the only complaint I have is the hardware we have to deal with," Harrison said. "It's unwieldy, it's unattractive and it's in the middle of my living room." Harrison noted that even though there's an even faster level of service available, 1,000-megabits-per-second (a gigabit), he couldn't imagine needing it. Prices for Salt Lake customers start at $50 a month for the Fiber 100 (100 Mbps) and go up from there. A gigabit will cost you $70 a month and Google also offers add-ons like fiber TV for an additional $90 a month, fiber phone for $10 a month or an entertainment package (with streaming services like Spotify Premium) for $15 a month. Comment on this story An informal survey of the city's community groups reflect that, at the moment, besides the already serviced downtown area, only Sugar House and Rose Park have active Google Fiber installation happening in residential areas. The East Bench and East Liberty Wells councils have had recent visits from Google reps and Fairpark Community Council was told the area would be seeing service near the end of the year. In recent months, Google has scaled back its previously reported expansion of Google Fiber service to other U.S. cities, but has been unwavering in reassurances that the Salt Lake project will be seen through to completion. In a statement shared with the Deseret News, the company wrote: "Our commitment to SLC remains: build the fastest, most effective and highest quality network in the most efficient and least disruptive way possible."

Bixby -- introduced at Samsung's unveiling of Galaxy S8 smartphones -- aims to help the South Korean giant break into a surging market for voice-activated virtual assistants, which includes Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, Google's Assistant and Microsoft's Cortana. The latest personal digital assistant distinguishes itself from competitors by using voice commands rather than touch to control handsets or applications, factoring in location awareness and image recognition. The integrated camera function allows users to identify buildings, such as popular tourist sites, to access their websites and other information simply by snapping a photo. The photo recognition technology can also help users decipher menus in foreign languages, or find places to shop for specific items they photograph. "It impressed me that they were doing image recognition and context awareness," said Bob O'Donnell, analyst and consultant with Technalysis Research, who attended the presentation. "It adds some new twists we haven't seen before," he said, noting Bixby's ability to make recommendations. Yet Bixby is still a work in progress -- the virtual entity did not speak at the New York demonstration. It has yet to be infused with technology from Samsung's recently acquired Viv, a company founded by creators of Apple's Siri. "It's not talking yet," O'Donnell said. "They have room to expand and grow." - Tough competitors - Bixby will face competition from established players -- even from Samsung's own phones, where users can choose to use Assistant, Cortana or Alexa. Richard Windsor, an independent analyst who writes the Radio Free Mobile blog, said Bixby may face problems because the "best-in-class Google Assistant" will be on the home button of the new phone, which is powered by Google-backed Android software. That means Bixby has a "fearsome competitor" on its own flagship device, according to the analyst. "Bixby is trying to do things a little differently but careful assessment of what Samsung demonstrated shows a service that has very little intelligence at all," Windsor said. Roger Kay of Endpoint Technologies Associates said Bixby might face challenges catching up with its rivals, which have been deployed for some time. "You can't build these things overnight," Kay said. "It would take years to create something as developed as Siri." Still, he noted, it is important for Samsung to be in the game. "These are table stakes," Kay said. "You can't not deal with voice. It's hands-free and can summarize a lot of things quickly." Amazon appears to have impacted the sector the most with its connected speakers using Alexa. The service allows users a wide range of voice interactions for music, news, purchases and connects with smart home devices. "Alexa is the top dog," Kay said. "Amazon has done the best work from a commercial perspective. They took it out of the theoretical to put it to work for things people want to do." - Beyond the phone - Samsung has also promoted Bixby as a remote hub for connected devices, which is another challenge as it takes the software beyond the smartphone. Patrick Moorhead, analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy, said Bixby's success in the connected home may depend on how much data it can collect. "Machine learning gets better the more training it gets and the more data it gets," Moorhead said. While Bixby cannot benefit from the large databases of competitors Apple and Windows, it could potentially sync with Samsung electronics and smart home appliances through Samsung's SmartThings platform. "Samsung ships so many devices from phones to Chromebooks to washing machines, it is picking up a different set of information, so it might end up being smarter than Siri," he said. "Siri doesn't know what's in your refrigerator, Samsung does." The app faces an uphill battle in a fragmented market where competing platforms don't always work together. Moorhead said tech companies are jockeying for a position in order to "get access to data -- by using this interface they can build detailed profiles on you."

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > New version of Google Calendar makes the most of… New version of Google Calendar makes the most of the iPad's larger screen By Kyle Wiggers — March 29, 2017 1:06 PM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you If you've been holding out for an iPad-optimized version of Google Calendar, we've got some good news: It's finally here. Better late than never. On Wednesday, Google launched a new version of Google Calendar, its popular web-based planner, for Apple’s iPad. It’s basically like the Google Calendar app for iPhone, but optimized for the iPad’s larger screen. Bigger icons make dragging and dropping calendar appointments a little easier, and enlarged text simplifies the process of adding new appointments. More: Your fitness goals from Google Fit and Apple Health now show up in Google Calendar It’s a little more intuitive, too, than the built-in Calendar app for iOS — especially when it comes to syncing Google Calendars. Normally, syncing multiple Google Calendars requires supplying your Google Credentials to Apple’s Calendar settings, signing into your Google account, and checking the individual boxes beside the calendars you want to sync with your device. With the new Google Calendar for iOS, you only have to sign in once. Otherwise, the new Google Calendar for iPad boasts all of Calendar’s existing features. One of those is Smart Scheduling, which suggests meeting times and available rooms based on participant’s availability and room preferences. Goals, meanwhile, intelligently schedules goals that you want to achieve in the upcoming weeks and months — if you set a goal to go running at 6:30 a.m. every other morning but don’t actually start running until 7:15 a.m., Google will reschedule future events automatically. More: Learn to keep your calendar organized with our best Google-Fu The new Calendar app is built into iOS Spotlight search — you can search for appointments and meetings from the iPad’s home screen. And it ships with a new Today View Widget that shows upcoming events in Notification Center (and in the future, on the lock screen). The release of Calendar for iPad comes on the heels of fitness app integration. In January, Google linked Apple’s Health app and Google’s own Fit to Google Calendar. Fitness goals you’ve scheduled in either show up in Google Calendar, and once you accomplish them, marks the events as done. More: How to sync multiple Google Calendars with your iOS device In April, Google Calendar gained support for reminders on desktop. When you set a reminder with apps like Inbox by Gmail, Google Keep, Google Now, and through the Google Calendar app, it will sync with the web client. Unlike calendar entries, reminders are present until they’re complete, and appear at the top of your calendar each day.
Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Google's updated Search app comes with… Google's updated Search app comes with Gboard, Google's third-party keyboard By Kyle Wiggers — March 29, 2017 2:04 PM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you The new Google Search app with Gboard makes it easier to find emoji, GIFs, and more. Android may be Google’s operating system, but that doesn’t mean the search giant’s ignoring its second-largest market: Apple’s iOS. This week, Google rolled out a string of updates to one of its most popular iPhone products: Search. Starting this week, the Google Search app for iOS now includes Google’s third-party Gboard as part of its download — you will see the option to enable Gboard in the Google app’s settings. More: Google updates iPhone Search app with a smarter Google Now and customized alerts Gboard, Google’s third-party keyboard for iOS, already boasts an impressive number of features. The headlining feature is a built-in Google Search bar that lets you send weather forecasts, videos, images, news, restaurant recommendations, emojis, GIFs, and anything else Google’s servers manage to find. Gboard’s support for glide typing lets you compose replies by swiping a finger across the keyboard (a faster alternative to tapping out the letters individually). And voice transcription’s on board, too. The new Search app for iOS also boasts “Trending on Google,” a widget that features breaking news and other topics based on trending searches across Google. Tapping on an item launches the Google app, so you can read more. Apple’s 3D Touch features heavily in the new update. A 3D Touch on the Search app’s icon surfaces up options to start a voice, image, or incognito search, and a tap on the ‘G’ icon at the bottom of the screen quickly starts a new search. A 3D Touch on the search results themselves, meanwhile, shows a preview of the content in question. More: The new and improved Google app makes it easier to keep track of recommendations, reminders, and interests The new widget’s easy to add. Tapping on the Edit button from the button of the Notification Center brings it up, as does a 3D Touch. Increasingly, Google’s Search app is becoming a one-stop shop for the search giant’s services. Two years ago, Google rolled out an update that added conversational voice. Basically, it put voice questions in context — asking, “What’s the weather like?” and immediately following up with, “How about this weekend?” will show results tailored to the second query. Last year, Google rolled out a streamlined Search app that broke results into two categories: Current Topics and Upcoming Events. News, sports, weather, and other topics populated the former and info about calendar appointments and important emails took up the latter.
Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Android apps could rake in more cash than iOS this… Android apps could rake in more cash than iOS this year — but there’s a catch By Adam Ismail — March 29, 2017 2:22 PM Subscribe Share bloomua/123RF Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you With higher revenue numbers, Android could attract even more developer support, potentially leading to higher quality apps and more innovation on the platform. This year is slated to be a pivotal one for app sales, according to a report from App Annie. The analytics firm projects Android app revenue to overtake that of iOS for the first time ever by the end of 2017 — but there’s a catch. Apple’s App Store should pull in $40 billion, by App Annie’s estimation. This would make for an increase of $6 billion over last year’s numbers. Google Play, on its own, is expected to deliver a little more than half that in 2017 — $21 billion. So where’s the other $20 billion coming from? More: Google Play celebrates anniversary with lists of its most popular apps App Annie If you combine Google Play’s revenue with that of other Android app stores, like Amazon’s, Samsung’s, and SlideMe, app spend on the platform could overtake iOS by roughly $1 billion, the report claims. While Google on its own may narrow the gap to Apple over the next five years — App Annie says by 2021, Google could be earning somewhere around $42 billion a year, compared to Apple’s $60 billion — the company will likely continue to lose significant sales to third-party marketplaces for the foreseeable future. What makes Apple’s performance especially impressive is that the company managed less than half the app downloads Google achieved last year — 29 billion to 63 billion, respectively — and still raked in double the sales. App Annie attributes this to Apple’s relatively more affluent customers, but Android could somewhat compensate for this with its more dominant market share worldwide and rapidly growing install base in emerging markets like India, Brazil, and Indonesia. Such markets are expected to play a major role in the growth of the app economy — particularly China, which is beginning to mature. The country far and away leads the rest of the world in terms of downloads, but App Annie sees this trend slowing in the next few years. At the same time, revenue from Chinese users may actually increase. The report predicts China could eventually account for as much as 41 percent of worldwide app spending by 2021.

Bixby — introduced at Samsung’s unveiling of Galaxy S8 smartphones — aims to help the South Korean giant break into a surging market for voice-activated virtual assistants, which includes Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, Google’s Assistant and Microsoft’s Cortana. The latest personal digital assistant distinguishes itself from competitors by using voice commands rather than touch to control handsets or applications, factoring in location awareness and image recognition. The integrated camera function allows users to identify buildings, such as popular tourist sites, to access their websites and other information simply by snapping a photo. The photo recognition technology can also help users decipher menus in foreign languages, or find places to shop for specific items they photograph. “It impressed me that they were doing image recognition and context awareness,” said Bob O’Donnell, analyst and consultant with Technalysis Research, who attended the presentation. “It adds some new twists we haven’t seen before,” he said, noting Bixby’s ability to make recommendations. Yet Bixby is still a work in progress — the virtual entity did not speak at the New York demonstration. It has yet to be infused with technology from Samsung’s recently acquired Viv, a company founded by creators of Apple’s Siri. “It’s not talking yet,” O’Donnell said. “They have room to expand and grow.” Tough competitors Bixby will face competition from established players — even from Samsung’s own phones, where users can choose to use Assistant, Cortana or Alexa. Richard Windsor, an independent analyst who writes the Radio Free Mobile blog, said Bixby may face problems because the “best-in-class Google Assistant” will be on the home button of the new phone, which is powered by Google-backed Android software. That means Bixby has a “fearsome competitor” on its own flagship device, according to the analyst. “Bixby is trying to do things a little differently but careful assessment of what Samsung demonstrated shows a service that has very little intelligence at all,” Windsor said. Roger Kay of Endpoint Technologies Associates said Bixby might face challenges catching up with its rivals, which have been deployed for some time. “You can’t build these things overnight,” Kay said. “It would take years to create something as developed as Siri.” Still, he noted, it is important for Samsung to be in the game. “These are table stakes,” Kay said. “You can’t not deal with voice. It’s hands-free and can summarise a lot of things quickly.” Amazon appears to have impacted the sector the most with its connected speakers using Alexa. The service allows users a wide range of voice interactions for music, news, purchases and connects with smart home devices. “Alexa is the top dog,” Kay said. “Amazon has done the best work from a commercial perspective. They took it out of the theoretical to put it to work for things people want to do.” Beyond the phone Samsung has also promoted Bixby as a remote hub for connected devices, which is another challenge as it takes the software beyond the smartphone. Patrick Moorhead, analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy, said Bixby’s success in the connected home may depend on how much data it can collect. “Machine learning gets better the more training it gets and the more data it gets,” Moorhead said. While Bixby cannot benefit from the large databases of competitors Apple and Windows, it could potentially sync with Samsung electronics and smart home appliances through Samsung’s SmartThings platform. “Samsung ships so many devices from phones to Chromebooks to washing machines, it is picking up a different set of information, so it might end up being smarter than Siri,” he said. “Siri doesn’t know what’s in your refrigerator, Samsung does.” The app faces an uphill battle in a fragmented market where competing platforms don’t always work together. Moorhead said tech companies are jockeying for a position in order to “get access to data — by using this interface they can build detailed profiles on you.” — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Samsung’s assistant Bixby in tough challenge to rivals Apple ‘spaceship’ headquarters readies for boarding China’s TCL brings back physical keyboard in new BlackBerry Google adds new languages, voice dictation to its iPhone keyboard Lazada launches ‘Lovezada’ dating app (VIDEO) Find the stations with the cheapest petrol with MyPetrol app China’s TCL brings back physical keyboard in new BlackBerry Apple ‘spaceship’ headquarters readies for boarding Google adds new languages, voice dictation to its iPhone keyboard Lazada launches ‘Lovezada’ dating app (VIDEO) Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Star-studded lineup in 'War Machine' Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles Samsung stations the smartphone as a desktop replacement (VIDEO) Samsung faces ‘biggest test’ with Galaxy S8 launch Meet Bixby, Samsung’s new artificial intelligence assistant Samsung Galaxy S8 rumours: Smaller case, more screen real estate Samsung won’t unveil Galaxy S8 smartphone at MWC show Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Speaking at Ad Week Europe last week the former editor-in-chief of the Guardian said media companies should be learning from Facebook and Google. Why?

Speaking at Ad Week Europe last week the former editor-in-chief of the Guardian said media companies should be learning from Facebook and Google. Why? Because the tech giants continue to forge trusted relationships with consumers and gobble up what once was publisher ad revenue. "It's very easy to say Google and Facebook are stealing money. They are and they're awful, but they seem to have a relationship with people at large that the press ought to be thinking about," Rusbridger reportedly said. "We need to rethink how we can build more trust, and at the same time harness the power that exists out there because that's what Google and Facebook are doing." So can publishers plug themselves into the online mainframe like Google and Facebook? And is Rusbridger right to advise media outlets to try to imitate technology firms? Any publisher that wanted to try would need to stop caring so much about content. Facebook and Google have both been at pains to point out that they're not media companies. And while it's a mealy-mouthed line, in many ways, it's also true. They employ algorithms, not editors, create digital products not daily editions. While they certainly have skin in the content game, they are far more focused on engineering. Content may be king, but digital distribution is the kingmaker. Both Facebook and Google have been on the shift to mobile. Mobile ads accounted for 80pc of Facebook's $5.6bn ad revenue in Q4 2016, while Google has split how it indexes the internet, making mobile its primary index. All these efforts are underpinned by massive investment in technology. So if a media company really wanted to do as Alan Rusbridger is suggesting, it would need to start spending heavily on research and development. How heavily? Well, Facebook spent $1,563m in the last quarter of 2016. Google, for its part, has been focused on artificial intelligence - another costly exercise. In 2016 the company launched over 350 products powered by machine learning. Artificial intelligence has been added to search, maps, messaging and Google Translate. It may be artificial but it ain't cheap. Google has acquired 11 AI companies in recent years. One, DeepMind, snapped up in 2014, cost $400m. Publishers that want to follow Google and Facebook's lead not only need to stump up that sort of cash, they also need to start collating monumental amounts of data which can power their machine-learning efforts. Its doubtful that any media company has the data or the deep pockets for this sort of investment. Let's move onto the issue of trust, also raised by Rusbridger. Certainly it's a problem. The 2017 Edelman trust barometer found that trust in media had dropped to 43pc and is at all-time lows in 17 countries. In the US Gallup recently found only 26pc of those aged 18 to 49 said they have a great deal or fair amount of trust in the mass media. This was down from 36pc last year. So yes, trust is an issue. But is it an issue for technology companies? Yes, of course it is. Both Google and Facebook face a challenge in relation to the spread of low-quality content from clickbait to fake news. But trust is a function of utility from their perspective. They don't need to focus on building trust if they build the best, most useful digital products. Create the best email services, the best mapping tools, the social network where all your friends are, and trust comes as a matter of course. So perhaps media outlets shouldn't be trying to imitate Facebook and Google. But they do need to figure out how to play to their strengths and co-exist with the tech giants, which have stolen a march in terms of digital distribution. Justin B Smith, chief executive of Bloomberg Media, published a survival guide for the platform era this week. "While Google and Facebook may have won Round 1, the real fight is coming up, as $250bn in brand advertising locked up in TV and print floods into digital across the coming years," he said. "Publishers were built for brand advertising, with great content, beautiful environments and strong, trusted brands. Meanwhile, platforms are showing more and more vulnerabilities due to fake news and environments that aren't 'brand safe'. Publishers can still carve out valuable, lasting businesses, but they need to execute a clear plan." Smith is offering better advice than Rusbridger: have your own plan and execute. Don't play the imitation game.

A Special Message From Scoop Co-Founder Alastair Thompson Dear Friends of Scoop, I am writing to you today from a third-floor garret in the town of Dinan, in Brittany France. Through the window in front of me the 12th century St Sauveur Basilica is nearly close enough to touch. I hope my message reaches you well in NZ where I gather autumn has now arrived. If you are one of the 1500+ donors who have pledged to Scoop over the past two years this message is especially directed to you. It contains a detailed explanation as to why Scoop is crowd-funding again, and why we continue to need financial assistance from our readers and members. I would ask that you please take the time to read at least to the end of the first passage in this rather long post. There you will find a series of questions that you may be interested in which link to the answers. We know that those of you who have supported Scoop these past two years didn't do so lightly. We know you are interested in our progress and we understand many of you will have questions about matters like: For how much longer will donor support be needed? This post is answers those questions. And if you have further questions you can reach me on twitter @althecat or by email at alastair@scoopmedia.co.nz. I will be happy to answer any further questions supporters have. Then, having had your questions answered, I hope as many of you as possible will then decide to donate to Scoop's "Opening The Election" PledgeMe Campaign. We are presently at 30% with just two weeks left to run. We will need at least 300 more supporters to step forward and contribute to reach our target. On our PledgeMe Campaign Page you will see that Scoop is seeking $30,000 in funding to "supercharge our election journalism", and this is true. But it's a form of words that may understate the importance of this request for funding. Without this funding we will be struggling to deploy the resources we will need to properly cover this - our 7th election - and our first in our new form as a charitably owned news company. We are very keen to put our best foot forward, and have exciting plans and collaborations brewing which we think you, our readers and supporters, will enjoy. To put this super-charging a little deeper in context, we need this money to ensure we can focus on the election and not on keeping the wolf from the door. For example one of the first things we will do upon reaching the target will be to raise all staff wages to the Living Wage level. For us this will be an important milestone, far too long delayed. In short my message to you today is that this is not a drill. We do need this money. Failure to achieve this target will constrain what we can provide. To sweeten the deal for those of you are involved in, or supportive of political activism, we have also opened up a 2 million "ads for good" collective advert giveaway reward which will be activated when we reach our target. But we also realise that rewards are only part of the equation for those deciding on whether to support a project such as this. Now after two years of asking for and receiving your generous support, a more fulsome explanation of where we are presently at, and where we are headed is needed – especially by those of you who have generously donated in past campaigns. This post is the place to find out all the things. Till now financial detail around the challenges Scoop has faced over the past two and half years have been closely held. Today however, all that can be, is laid bare. For ease of access I have written this in the form of an FAQ. You can jump to the answer of the questions using the contents links below. Contents: Introduction Why don't you just cut costs & stem the losses? Why should Scoop receive public support at all? Why can't you support yourselves with commercially derived revenue? Spinoff.co.nz and NewsRoom.co.nz are getting money, why aren't you? How is the Ethical Paywall going then? Ok then, but what about now? How big is the shortfall now? Ahem, how big is the shortfall? APPENDIX A: A short history of Scoop's member/donor fund-raising efforts B: The Near Impossible Comes Together C: The final big push B: 2016 & a change of guard Kind Regards Alastair Thompson Dinan, France St Sauveur Basilica, Dinan, Brittany Click for big version >> Pledge Towards Scoop's "Opening The Election" Pledge Me Campaign << ****** ### ***** Introduction Spring has arrived here in France. Daffodils, cherries and magnolias led the charge, closely followed by the opening of remarkably intricate buds on the branches of countless trees. The light green shoots will soon become new branches and leaves – and the pageant of life will once again play out its cycle.   And top of my mind today as I write to you is the process of regeneration, the recycling of the old into new and in particular the tricky business cycle of Scoop.co.nz. For the past decade every summer Scoop's customers have gone into a form of seasonal hibernation. And every summer this causes us considerable financial stress. The inability to save sufficient funds each year to finance our summer down-turns has been the Achilles heel of our business. Almost all the losses that were incurred over the past decade occurred in the three months of summer. >> Pledge Towards Scoop's "Opening The Election" Pledge Me Campaign << >> Pledge Towards Scoop's "Opening The Election" Pledge Me Campaign << ****** ### ***** Why don't you just cut costs to cover the summer downturn & stem the losses? The short answer is that we have now cut them as far as is possible. Scoop's revenues have fallen from $900,000 in 2007 to $250,000 now. Any fewer staff than we presently have would mean that we couldn't deliver the core services that the business is based around. With the benefit of hindsight some deeper cuts earlier might have made a difference to the outcome – and this is something I take full responsibility for. In the six years between 2007 and 2013 Scoop's revenues fell $400,000 to $500,000. During that period we were continually finding cost savings and reducing staffing, but we never managed to cut quite fast enough. We under-estimated the impact of the changes in advertising markets and over-estimated our ability to find replacement revenue. Like most digital startups we concentrated energy on investing in developing and selling new subscription newsagent.scoop.co.nz and advertising products. This helped slow the decline but not enough to keep us afloat. That said this investment means we are now much better positioned for a turn-around than we would otherwise have been – and indeed the revenue growth on those products kept us alive. Through the period from the GFC in 2008 through to 2013 we lost on average around $30,000 a year. These losses were covered by investors, mostly friends and family plus a significant outside investor in the period from 2012 to 2014. Since the initiation of "Operation Chrysalis" in 2015 we have cut costs significantly further and as explained in detail in the next section, Scoop's losses are now small and shrinking. But before addressing the question of how much we need to keep the lights on, I think it would be helpful to first address the question of why we think Scoop's lights are worth the candle. >> Pledge Towards Scoop's "Opening The Election" Pledge Me Campaign << >> Pledge Towards Scoop's "Opening The Election" Pledge Me Campaign << ****** ### ***** So why should Scoop receive support? While ensuring the survival of journalism has been the clarion call in most of Scoop's fund-raising efforts these past two years, the effort to keep Scoop alive is not simply about journalism. It is equally about preserving an opportunity - Scoop's regular base of 500,000 monthly influential readers – which we believe can provide a magnificent foundation, foundation both economically and in terms of readership for a new journalism start-up to flourish. But beyond that Scoop's existing core service is – we believe - also very valuable to NZ society. Had Scoop's founders and supporters not thought this were the case we wouldn't have gone to all this trouble. And the fact that over 500,000 monthly readers engage with it, and that 1000 donors, and nearly 150 ethical paywall subscribers are now supporting it is testament that ours is not a mistaken belief, For me keeping Scoop alive has always also been about enabling New Zealand's national discourse, or as Russell Brown once described it "NZ's national argument". When you work at Scoop you see this unfold in front of you. A national debate over the current issues, punctuated by breaking news developments, between the political, business and civil society spheres. As our mission statement says – at Scoop we believe in the "power of compelling ideas to propel themselves into political consciousness if they are able to get exposure and be debated". In other words, and we hope you agree, it is worth enabling a platform which provides the Scoop service because a democracy in which everybody has a voice, is a democracy that can thrive. it is worth putting some metrics behind that for emphasis. Each day: - Our core editorial team of three publish around 200 items containing breaking news content from around 200 different voices - no other publication has that breadth of contributors; - 25,000 users read between 30,000 and 50,000 pages of content. This amounts to about 600 hours, or nearly a month of continuous reading time every day; - Roughly 9000 of these users arrive to read something that they have been searching for on Google; - Half a million links to Scoop.co.nz are displayed in the first page of Google search results pages for an astonishing range of queries; - Google robotically reads around 120,000 pages to check for new material and whether old pages are still live (all Scoop's pages remain live back to June 10 1999 – and accessible via search.scoop.co.nz); - Around 10,000 out-bound links on Scoop (to other sites in our networks, or linked in our content) are clicked. When people want to know when something happened or what someone said, Scoop provides the answer, for free. This is a bulwark against misinformation and fake news. And Scoop reaches the important audiences who need access to reliable factual information – which albeit perhaps counter-intuitively - is what press releases tend to contain. Last week Scoop served at least[*]: - 8869 pages to 3717 readers on Government domains - 897 pages to 303 readers in Parliament (as well as 100ss of email alerts) - 3002 pages to 1718 readers in Universities [*] not all traffic is fully identified in server logs. Back in 2007 Scoop was generating $60,000 in advertising revenue a month from this usage. And yet now - due to the rise of Facebook and Google - Scoop's steadily growing usage isn't nearly sufficient to generate the funds to make our operation commercially viable via conventional advertising. But this is not a measure of Scoop's utility (or value) to New Zealand. Neither as Scoop.co.nz is used now, nor as we may be able to come if we can complete our transition to sustainability over the next two or three years and serve as a foundation for new digital news startups. >> Pledge Towards Scoop's "Opening The Election" Pledge Me Campaign << >> Pledge Towards Scoop's "Opening The Election" Pledge Me Campaign << ****** ### ***** But why can't you support yourselves with commercially derived revenue? This is a good question. And the short answer is that we expect to be able to support ourselves on commercial revenue shortly. We just haven't completed our transition yet. Slowing that process down is the insufficiency of our sales resource. Whereas previously around half of my time at Scoop was spent in sales and business development, these days Scoop's business development team is a one-man band. Had we been more successful in our fund-raising efforts these past two years this is probably where we would have first invested additional funds. >> Pledge Towards Scoop's "Opening The Election" Pledge Me Campaign << >> Pledge Towards Scoop's "Opening The Election" Pledge Me Campaign << ****** ### ***** But Spinoff.co.nz and NewsRoom.co.nz are getting money, why aren't you? Scoop would love to receive the robust levels of corporate sponsorship support that are now flowing to our industry colleagues at Spinoff.co.nz and NewsRoom.co.nz & our audience would certainly justify it. And we congratulate both our competitors for re-opening this source of income. But sponsorship deals are far from easy to get over the line. The normal metrics of marketing spend do not apply and often the critical factor is who you know at the target company or organisation. Being Wellington based, being known mainly as a press release publisher, and being nearly 18 years old all count against us too. Sponsors tend to be attracted to the new and flashy and Scoop.co.nz is more like an old and trusty public transport service – we get you where you want to go, but most people don't tend to give a lot of thought to our upkeep. In addition these new sources of funds for media are indeed new. Sponsorship funding for news didn't really exist back in 2014. To the extent that it did so prior to that it was mainly on the basis of a traditional competitive marketing return-on-investment (ROI) basis, which the arrival of Google, Facebook and programmatic advertising models pretty much destroyed as a viable source of income for niche publishers in NZ. In the three months after the 2014 election we sold no advertising or sponsorship at all. It was like the market had fallen off a cliff. And so we made a conscious decision - which we still think is right - to try to find sustainability without being dependent on advertising dollars. Its worth also pointing out that sponsorship sales efforts are expensive, sponsors need to be kept happy, jollied along, and even when you do so diligently a change of personnel can see them depart in a heartbeat. So when we initiated "Operation Chrysalis" we decided to put our efforts into earning money from our core business, by finding a way of generating value from our existing large reader base with what is clearly a much used and highly-valued service. From this came our new "ethical paywall". And since 2015 nearly all our limited marketing resources have been invested into that. >> Pledge Towards Scoop's "Opening The Election" Pledge Me Campaign << >> Pledge Towards Scoop's "Opening The Election" Pledge Me Campaign << ****** ### ***** So how is the Ethical Paywall going then? Good, albeit not quite as well as we had hoped it would go. To recap: Scoop's "sustainable" business idea, introduced in May 2015, was to change our terms and conditions of use. Legally if you or the business that you work for routinely uses Scoop for professional purposes – i.e. to check out what is going on in matters of professional interest to you or your staff – then you should be paying us. So far 140 organisations have signed on to do so. But many hundreds more, including the vast majority of Govt. departments, local authorities, universities, law firms, PR companies, large corporates and accounting and consultancy businesses are not. Were even a 10% of our corporate uses complying with our terms and conditions of use, we would be profitable today. And it is not as if the costs of professional use of Scoop are high. Meanwhile all these organisations continue to receive free value from us in the form of us carrying their communications to our large and influential readership. The good news is that most of those who do sign on to, contribute towards the up-keep of a service they rely on are staying on board. Our commercial team (who can be contacted at services@scoop.co.nz) estimate we need to get another 100 accredited organisations on board to get to a sustainable break-even position. >> Pledge Towards Scoop's "Opening The Election" Pledge Me Campaign << >> Pledge Towards Scoop's "Opening The Election" Pledge Me Campaign << ****** ### ***** Ok then, but what about now? How big is the shortfall now? I'll get to the answer to that in a second. But first I want to tell a little story. Shortly before he died of leukaemia in early 2012 I bumped into Lloyd Morrison, the founder of Infratil and Morrison & Company, on the Terrace in Wellington. Lloyd and I had become friends after he asked my assistance in an effort to save Air New Zealand for sale to Qantas. With Scoop's support Lloyd, Dr Ian Prior and I mounted what was ultimately a successful effort to help convince the Commerce Commission that having an airline monopoly in NZ and Trans Tasman wouldn't be in the interests of the travelling public. "How's business," Lloyd asked me. "Well not to bad I guess," I replied, and asked after his health. Lloyd indicated he was still fighting on, before offering some advice that has stuck with me ever since. "So the thing is Alastair," he said, "that's not the right answer. When someone asks you how business is? The answer is always 'great!' regardless of whether it is or not. That's what everybody wants to hear. People want to do business with people who are already winning." I took Lloyd's advice to heart and I suspect that it was thanks to doing so that the sales efforts that miraculously kept Scoop alive through 2012, 2013 and 2014 came off as well as they did. But the reason I recount that story as this entire story I am publishing today is breaking that rule. Yet I have a strong feeling that now is the time that it is necessary to do so. By now surely everybody understands just how perilous it is to be in the news media business. Digital advertising cannot support news production in NZ – it is that simple. In the past month Fairfax has lost both its CEO and its chief commercial officer. After losing the CEO the Commerce Commission granted an extension to the time till it will deliver its verdict on the StuffMe merger. And last week after the commercial manager resigned it extended the deadline again. Over the past two years I have lost count of the number of panel discussions held to discuss the funding crisis in the news business. And yet very little that is constructive is done. The Green Party's election policy restoring funding to Radio New Zealand that was lost due to the National Party capping their funding is a step in the right direction, but not nearly enough. And so all things considered, the dynamics we now face - running a business partially funded by donations, and owned by a charity requires a different approach. It is time to break Lloyd's golden rule. >> Pledge Towards Scoop's "Opening The Election" Pledge Me Campaign << >> Pledge Towards Scoop's "Opening The Election" Pledge Me Campaign << ****** ### ***** Ahem. How big is the shortfall? So here's the skinny. Scoop's current operating costs - mostly wages for four full time and three part time staff - are around $25k each month. For most of the year last year on a monthly basis our income exceeded this. But on an annual basis thanks to the summer down-turn we are continuing to experience shortfalls – and this latest summer just past that short fall was $20,000. That said the shortfalls are falling. During 2015, the main year of transformation the overall shortfall in revenue met by crowd-funding was close to $80,000. On an averaged out basis during calendar 2016 the shortfall was $2000 a month, or $24,000 in total. And more recently slowing sales over the 2016-17 summer period - incurred a further $15,000 shortfall. And it is because of these shortfalls that we have had to come back to our supporters and readers this early in 2017 to raise further funds. The good news is that sales in the month of March have already taken us back into the black, more than covering our costs with a small margin on top. In the event we receive the expected growth in support from a professional users over the remainder of 2017 (please email services@scoop.co.nz if you think you or your organisation might be one of these users and would like to purchase a professional use license) we remain on track to reaching long term sustainability this year. And if that is the outcome then it is likely that this be the only fund-raising effort mounted for Scoop Publishing Limited this year. ENDS >> Pledge Towards Scoop's "Opening The Election" Pledge Me Campaign << >> Pledge Towards Scoop's "Opening The Election" Pledge Me Campaign << ****** ### ***** APPENDIX A: A short history of Scoop's crowd/member/donor fund-raising efforts When we embarked on "Operation Chrysalis" a week before Christmas we first held a meeting in the Scoop office to decide whether to try to keep Scoop alive or shut the doors. 2014 had been a very hard year for everybody in the team and so I wasn't sure how it would go. But Scoop's team is definitely not made out of quitters. I began by explaining the dire financial situation we faced. We had made almost no advertising sales at all since the 2014 Election. We only had sufficient funds at that point to get through to January. I then outlined the rescue plan. We would try to turn Scoop's business model around whilst simultaneously turning the privately run business into a charitable foundation. I was open about the fact that we had a slim chance of success – internally I reckoned our chances of getting to the end of the year were about 10% at best. And there was every chance we might fail at the first hurdle. The plan's success was dependent on running a crowd-funding campaign, our first ever, in early 2015 – to get the ball rolling. If that succeeded we then had to develop, deploy and quickly scale a brand new, un-tested business model. If that worked then we would raise some additional funds, again through crowd-funding to but the necessary time to grow the business model towards sustainability. And we faced a significant additional challenge. Because of the nature of Scoop's core wire service business – continuity of content publishing and supply is a must to maintain the confidence of existing clients. As a consequence of this, the 180 degree pivot of Scoop's business model needed to take place while existing services continued undisturbed. So what we set out to try to do was to build a new business engine for the Scoop train – untested - while we remained under full steam travelling down the tracks. And there was no way we could do it without also developing a significant level of financial support from a group of readers and silent supporters who we had, till then, barely engaged with at all. ****** ### ***** B: The Near Impossible Comes Together Scoop is now entering the third year of this transformation. Last Wednesday passed was the second anniversary of the completion of that first PledgeMe campaign. In the two years since we have run four further PledgeMe project campaigns, all of which have succeeded so far. We have enjoyed the repeated support of many of our pledgers through these campaigns. Some have donated four or five times and contributed several hundred dollars to the cause. For this we are enormously grateful. Without the financial support of these 1000+ Kiwis who care about the future of news Scoop.co.nz would not be around today. Our first two PledgeMe campaigns, "Help Scoop to Fly" and "16 days of Scoop" raised just over $45k between them. These bought us time to implement the "ethical paywall" and complete the legal preparations for the launch of the Scoop Foundation for Public Interest Journalism at the beginning of September 2015. The wonderful support and encouragement of PledgeMe'sAnna Guenther, Jackson Wood and Lisa-Marie Richan to teach us how to crowd-fund was a vital contributor to this outcome. To coincide with the launch of the Foundation & with the much appreciated help of a team from the Enspiral network led by Damian Sligo-Green - we launched our first in-house fund-raising website takebackthenews.nz. The site allowed for both donations and for people to sign up as contributors. Between its launch and Christmas 87 new members signed up and we received 100 offers of in kind support or collaboration from 100 contributors. Over the 10 month period from the launch of Operation Chrysalis to the launch of the Scoop Foundation the $48,000 in funds we received from in 525 pledges and 87 direct donations - covered roughly 25% of total expenses - including the costs of developing the new business model and preparing the legal work for the launch of the Foundation. ****** ### ***** C: The final big push But this fund-raising hadn't paid off all of our creditors. And with summer fast approaching more money was needed to ensure we would get through through the downturn. Our biggest PledgeMe campaign - to finance the launch of the Foundation - kicked off in October. It was the first fund-raising campaign mounted by the Scoop Foundation itself and it was by far the most elaborate campaign we had run -including a special run of art t-shirts and certificates with artwork by William Carden Horton, a public meeting, and a Friday the 13th costume party held at Dransfield House. The $50k target in this campaign was the minimum that we needed to both cover our bills and get us through the summer. By now the team was nearly exhausted and running largely on adrenaline, I certainly was. But fortunately by then we also had a fairly experienced team on the job including Steven Wood, Olex Cidor who made us a great series of videos shot at St Andrews on the Terrace to promote it, plus our database compiler Howard Davis, who has since become our arts editor was on the team. Nevertheless it didn't get off to as fast a start as was needed. Around half way through the campaign we decided our "Scoop's Solution to the News Crisis" messaging wasn't working and switched to the most successful campaign slogan we have used so far. A search for "1000 Kiwis who care about the future of NZ news media". It was a line with legs and something very similar was used by NewsRoom's Tim Murphy when he announced his and Mark Jennings launch plans at the end of 2016 for the new NewsRoom. "It [NewsRoomp] will be targeted at an audience that in broad terms we’ve defined as New Zealanders who care. News hounds. People who vote. People aware of the needs of good journalism in a democracy like ours." A positioning statement which was eerily familiar. ****** ### ***** D: 2016 & a change of guard Two weeks after the final campaign of 2015 closed, and after 16 years managing and editing Scoop.co.nz, I left Scoop and New Zealand for an extended overseas sabbatical. Hence my writing and publishing this from France. I remain involved with Scoopin the capacity of volunteer acting as a Director of Scoop and as a Trustee of the Scoop Foundation. And these days my primary efforts are focussed on the thorny issue of achieving financial stability. I very much hope we get there soon. That said it would be a shame having come so far to fail now. Thankfully 2016 brought with it a significantly improved financial performance, and last years fund-raising was able to be conducted in a much more methodical fashion. Joseph Cederwall joined the Scoop Foundation as our community engagement manager mid-year and led our online campaigning effort over the second half of the year. Joseph designed the "Opening the Election" campaign which is now underway, launched Hivemind and built our new Foundation website. Recently following Gordon Campbell's decision to step out of the Editor's role to concentrate on reporting Joseph and on of Scoop's other co-founders Ian Llewellyn were appointed as Scoop's new co-editors. In 2016 the Scoop Foundation Board set a fund-raising goal for the year of $60k. By the end of the year the Foundation had managed to raise half of this sum. In May 2016 the Foundation launched a PledgeMe Membership Drive around our 17th birthday with the title "Journalism a New Model – Membership Drive". The target of $17,000 was met in 303 donations. $7500 of these funds were used to fund three journalism project grants, to Alison McCulloch (Post Natal Depression), and Charlotte Graham and Veronika Meduna (both working on post-earthquake projects). Getting this grant based funding for public interest journalism underway in August was another significant milestone for the overall transformation project. As was the launch of our new mobile version of Scoop m.scoop.co.nz over summer by our new developer Wiremu Demchick. And following that effort we focused our resources on building a new fund-raising portal for the Scoop Foundation at foundation.scoop.co.nz. On the site we published our first Foundation annual report and set up facilities for donations. A fund-raising campaign followed at the end of the year which raised a further $12,000. **** ____----^^----____ **** © Scoop Media Alastair Thompson Scoop Publisher Alastair Thompson is the co-founder of Scoop.

Google always does a great job, from the Pokemon Google Maps overlay to a smart mailbox, but there are a few from other companies worth mentioning. Here's a rundown of all the hillarious (or strange) tech-related April Fools Day jokes from around the web. Google Gnome One of Google's product launches from last year was the Google Home, a $129 smart speaker with Google Assistant. Now the company is teasing the "Google Gnome," an outside version of the Home. You can ask it weather questions, let it control your lawnmower and other tools, and even dress it up in accessories. The Google Gnome has a page on the Google Store, but unfortunately you can't buy it. I really want a rain coat for my Google Home, though. Mrs. Pac-Man in Google Maps For April Fools' 2015, Google added Pac-Man into Google Maps and Ingress. This year, Mrs Pac-Man is invading Google Maps. For regions of the world already on April 1st, a new Mrs. Pac-Man button is visible on the mobile app. You then have to control Mrs. Pac-Man on real-life streets, and of course, outrun the Ghosts. Google's Bubble Wrap Keyboard (English subtitles are available) Google Japan's prank is pretty funny - it's a bubble wrap keyboard. The idea is to pop bubbles on a bubble wrap sheet to form words, then feed the sheet through a reader to send the message. Some of the bubble wrap sheets are even scented. Google Assistant Google has plenty of Easter Eggs in Google Assistant, and as you might expect, there's one for April Fools' Day too. When asked, Assistant will offer advice on how not to get pranked, such as "If something seems too good to be true today, it probably is." Google Wind Google's Netherlands division has its own April Fools' Day gag, named 'Google Wind.' The idea is to use machine learning to control the weather, using Holland's famous windmills. I'll admit, this one is pretty great. Netflix Live Will Arnet has been in plenty of Netflix original content, from BoJack Horseman to A Series of Unfortunate Events. For April Fools' Day, Netflix is proud to share 'Netflix Live', which is nearly an hour of Arnett commentating ordinary events like toasting bread and completing a crossword puzzle. It's actually funnier than it sounds. You can watch the full thing here (a Netflix subscription is required). T-Mobile ONEsie T-Mobile's prank is a onesie, with "full-body coverage" and a built-in 4G LTE hotspot. You can actually buy it for $40, but the real one doesn't have any tech inside it. Hulu Hu With the claim that the human attention span has "dropped to eight seconds," Hulu has released 'Hu.' It's just a library of short clips from existing Hulu content, and you actually need an account to see them. This is probably the lamest April Fools' Day gag in the list - better luck next year, guys. OnePlus Dash drink OnePlus is really proud of its Dash Charge feature, even to the point of enlisting celebrities to talk about it. For April Fools', the company made real Dash Charge energy drinks. You can find our review of the drink here. Lyft Mono For April Fools' Day, Lyft has announced the 'Lyft Mono.' It's a wearable glove, vaguely resembling a Nintendo Power Glove. This gag is actually real, and once you put it on and get the app, sticking out your thumb will hail a Lyft cab. You can sign up to for a chance to get one here. Honor BFF We all need some positive reinforcement every now and then, right? Honor thinks so, and created the Honor BFF. This imaginary phone uses machine learning to periodically give you compliments and motivation. Hopefully it ships with Android 7.1 Nougat. Google Haptic Helpers This is probably my favorite gag so far. In order to create a more realistic virtual reality experience, you can schedule a "haptic helper" to come to your house and help create a more realistic environment. Just watch the video, it's hilarious. Amazon Petlexa Alexa is cool and all, but your furry friends need one too. As the name implies, Petlexa is Alexa for your pets. Contour by SlickWraps Putting a skin on your phone or tablet is too much work. For April Fool's Day, Slickwraps is teasing the 'Countour' - a machine that sprays on device skins. Frankly, I'm not sure if this is actually real or not, but there is a page for it on SlickWrap's store. Nvidia GTX G-Assist How many times have you been playing an online game, only to be interrupted by someone in real life? NVIDIA has made the 'G Assist,' a flash drive that can take over for you if you're busy. It can also help you beat boss battles, and provides periodic reminders to consume energy drinks. More information and a video can be found here. Google's data center on Mars If you have important data, you need a backup. That's why Google announced its first interplanetary data center, named "Ziggy Stardust," on the Google Cloud Platform Blog today. Located in the Gale Crater on Mars, it will store a cache of data from Earth to prevent irrecoverable loss when a planetary disaster strikes. Google hopes to finish the data center by 2018. LineageOS' mascot CyanogenMod's mascot, Cid, was one of the most recognizable icons in the Android community. As the spiritual successor to CyanogenMod, LineageOS has created its own mascot - 'Ink'. The project also announced 'Br0zip,' an artificial intelligence that can port LineageOS to any device in no time at all. Chromebook accessories Even though most Chromebooks can now run Android apps, you still can't use your Chromebook like an Android phone/tablet for all use cases. Until now, that is. Google has announced a Chromebook Groupie Stick (seen above), a Chromebook Cardboard headset, and a Chromebook armband. See the company's blog post for more info. Exynos Yoga Processor Remember when curved phones were a thing? Maybe we'll see more in the coming months, because Samsung has just unveiled the Exynos Yoga Processor - the first flexible mobile SoC. Anyone up for a Galaxy Flex? Carved screen protector Carved is a small Indiana-based phone case company, but now they are working on a wooden screen protector. Why hasn't this been done before? I'll take ten. I'm Feeling Woof/I'm Feeling Meow By force-touching the Google app icon in iOS, you can select "I'm Feeling Woof" or "I'm Feeling Meow." These give your pets access to the stuff they care about - from dog food to balls of yarn. More info can be found on Google's blog post. Waze maps for Mars According to the company's blog, Waze is has begun to map the surface of Mars. Certain members of the Waze community will also be sent to the Red Planet to more accurately map the surface. JerryRigEverything's NoPhone video If you haven't heard about it, the NoPhone is a solid piece of plastic designed to simulate the feeling of a phone in your pocket. I'm not really sure if anyone uses it, but JerryRigEverything is happy to break it just as much as any other phone. Google Translate for Heptapod B Using machine learning, Google Translate can now decrypt messages written in Heptapod B - the language from the film Arrival.

Skip to content News Environment Health & Medicine Space Feature More ZME Science About Authors Archives Advertise Advertise Media Kit Legal Privacy Policy Comment Policy Contact Contact Info Subscribe Contribute Advertisement Yesterday, US officials said you had no right to online privacy — we don’t agree so here’s Internet Noise to help you out 0 Shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on Google+Share on LinkedinPin this PostShare on TumblrMore services Alexandru Micu March 30, 2017March 30, 2017 March 30, 2017March 30, 2017 Alexandru Micu In the wake of yesterday’s decision by the House of Representatives to allow internet service providers to sell browsing data, one programmer is determined to make that data as worthless as possible — and he’s willing to share his work. If you’re anything like me, when the House of Representatives decided yesterday that ISPs can sell your browsing data to basically anyone, you were positively furious. The word bull and something closely resembling the word “ship” rolled around in my head like a marble in a cup. I go to the Internet partly to work, partly to disconnect from the real world. And I like my privacy for both of those things. “You can’t have it.” — bunch of US officials. Harsh, I still want my privacy. I wanna browse pictures of cats in peace, then share a laugh over them without someone uninvited seeing any line of chat. I want to read NASA’s latest tidbits without the NSA (subtracting an A makes a huge difference) peering over my shoulder. It’s my experience. It’s my little corner of the immaterial. I don’t want anyone to burst in on it. If I wanted to be under constant surveillance I’d fly to London. But I don’t, so I just Google-Map London and use the tiny yellow guy to see the sights. *sigh* That’s not how it works, though, and I know that. ISPs keep track of everything you do because they actually connect you to the disjointed bits and servers to create the seamless Internet we know and love. For the most part, they had to keep this data to themselves, so we had some modicum of privacy. That’s about to change for those of you living in the US, congrats, since that data is now up for grabs by anyone who can pay for it — and make no mistake, people will pay for it, profile you with it, and then try to sell you stuff according to that profile. Because capitalism. I’m not a fan of that. Somehow it manages to have this 1984-meets-Brave New World vibe and I don’t want any of it, no siree. Paint me a barbarian but I’d rather not get a 10% discount on something I may actually want if it means a server somewhere is crunching my 3 AM alcohol-fueled-research of exotic cuisine on Wikipedia like so many 1’s and 0’s. ALSO READ  Only about half your friends actually consider you a friend Luckily, there’s one brave soul out there who feels the same way I do but also has the skills to do something about it. His name is Dan Schultz, and he has the next-best-thing after Internet invisibility. Dan heard about the vote on Twitter somewhere around 1 AM, turned off Zelda and coded Internet Noise — a tool which will shotgun searches in your browser left and right, all in the name of foggifying your real searches in a deluge of random ‘noise’. “I cannot function in civil society in 2017 without an internet connection, and I have to go through an ISP to do that,” he says. Hiding in plain sight Internet Noise acts like your run of the mill browser extension, but in truth, it’s just a website which will auto-open a bunch of random Google search tabs. The idea is that if you can’t keep an ISP from profiling you, you can at least give them a false image of yourself. It’s a pretty sad thing to need such a tool, and Schultz himself hopes that Noise will help people understand the risk their online privacy is under at this point. Advertisement It’s a pretty straightforward program. Schultz simply googled “top 4,000 nouns” and made a gibberish-list with all of them. With a click on “Make some Noise”, Internet Noise draws on the magic powering Google’s “I’m feeling lucky” button to search for those terms or permutations of them, opening five tabs of results. Ten seconds later, you get another five, then five more, and so on. It will keep going until you hit “STOP THE NOISE!”, by which point your browsing history should look like a potpourri of random links. Schultz says the best way to use it is to start the Noise when you call in for the night and stop it the next day. Soon enough, you’ll start seeing some pretty random stuff popping up in your Facebook feed, for example. Stuff you won’t have the first clue as to what it is, and that that’s proof the Noise is working, muddying your Internet activity profile, causing algorithms to spew out all kinds of false positives. Image credits g4ll4is / Flickr. Still, it’s not a do-all-end-all program. Anyone slightly more competent than your average advertising company could probably pick out your searches from the noise with a decent success rate since they’re obviously random clicks that have little follow-through. With 4,000 terms and 16,000,000 two-word combinations of them to rifle through, it’s also really unlikely to visit a page once and astronomically unlikely to visit it three or more times. It’s a really random fog-maker and its activity doesn’t look human or plausible enough to be truly good at masking your activity. A smart enough algorithm can probably pick Noise apart in a few seconds. But not all algorithms are smart. ALSO READ  Relying too much on the Internet for fact finding could hurt your brain It might even get you into some more hardcore surveillance if the program searches add up to something which appears sketchy. Schultz obviously hasn’t been able to pedigree all the terms to see if any could land you in a spot of trouble — think “pipes”, “industrial fertilizers”, and  “do we really need the government” in one night. I’m exaggerating on that last one just to prove a point. At the end of the day, though, Schiltz says the main point is to raise awareness. However, the project is open source and could evolve into a more complex program. People are already contributing, fixing minor bugs and some are suggesting possible improvements. But until more efficient privacy kits become available, your only real option is to learn as much as you can about what the tools you use can and can’t do and try to dodge the system as well as possible beyond what they offer.

In this intro video, Gmail Product Manager Paul McDonald introduces a radical advance in Gmail technology: Of course, Google trolled the internet by releasing the video on March 30. (Gmail itself had been introduced, not as a joke, on April 1, 2004.) Not content to live with just an intro video and a beta site, Google posted these hilarious "interviews" with "experts." First, a "paralanguage expert": And now an "environmental movement specialist" who suggests humans are "graspers, killers": A few days later, the University of Southern California's Institute for Creative Technologies actually implemented a few parts of Gmail Motion using a Microsoft Kinect and custom software. Behold: In addition to all the motion-control jokes that year, Google also released this video profile of a Google Autocompleter. (Best job ever?)

A young woman lost in the Arizona desert for five days filming her struggle to survive on her cell phone right up until the moment she thought she would never see her loved ones again. Tonight her account through dramatic footage and what she did right that saved her life. Here's ABC's Matt Gutman. I love my family. Mom, dad, kalie. Reporter: Recording a good-bye video to loved ones. Something no one expects they'll ever have to do. I just want to go home. I don't even want to do this trip anymore, I'm so scared. Reporter: Especially not 24-year-old amber van heck who just days before began a road trip that should have been the time of her life. But a series of mishaps instead brought her to the brink of death. Three weeks ago the outdoorsy Texas college student set out on a 3,000-mile road trip to the grand canyon all alone. Pretty courageous of you. I don't know if I'd call it courageous. It's more of a -- stubborn, probably. Reporter: She had a couple of particular spots in mind. The havasu falls trailhead, a remote spot in the grand canyon, it has aqua blue plunge pools so popular it requires a reservation. That's the trailhead? Yep. It's in the middle of nothing. Yes. Let's go. Reporter: This week we returned with amber to this fateful spot. The place where, directed by her smartphone, amber turned off highway 64 and onto this dirt road. I trusted Google maps which I shouldn't have. So we're barely a mile off the road. We're driving in empty space. Check that out. Nothing. Reporter: As night falls on March 12th, amber says she drives another hour and a half deeper into the middle of nowhere. When I came to the fence and I was like, oh. There wasn't a road here. That's when I was like, this is not good. That's when I tried going into the gps app and telling it to take me back. It was like, sorry, you have no internet service. Reporter: For a brief moment she's able to get cell service and immediately calls 911. I was in such a panicked state. When they said, what is the nature of your emergency? I let out a sob and I said, please help me. And I heard it drop. And I just -- Reporter: With no cell service for her Google navigation app, amber is about to lose a second precious resource. I was trying to watch my gas. Is that Orange light blinking? It had been blinking. Reporter: Earlier that day she had stopped to gas up her Ford edge and pumps only about one-third of a tank, hoping to save some money. How often do you think, if I just put $5, or just half a tank instead? Every day. I could have spared myself a lot of grief. Reporter: 119 hours of grief to be exact, which amber would battle the triumvirate of no fuel, no cell service, no navigation. In the darkness, she parks alongside the first manmade structure she sees, hoping a sign of life will appear in the morning. She begins documenting her ordeal. Hopefully it doesn't take too long to be found. Reporter: She's actually stranded on one of the largest cattle ranches in Arizona, run by Gary Wilson. It has happened to several other people trying to get across this ranch. Google Earth tells you that you can. But this ranch is actually closed. Reporter: Google did not respond to our requests for comment. A gps industry source previously told ABC news it is important for drivers to keep in mind the gps devices are to be used as navigational AIDS only. It is the responsibility of drivers to exercise common sense." A cowboy usually patrols the area where amber is parked, but again, amber was out of luck. He was gone for about five days. And that just happened to be the time that she was out here. Reporter: Back home, amber's dad, Steven, tries calling her phone and pinging her on her gps app. There is no response. I snapped at my boss that day. Because I was worried about her. Reporter: But there are some encouraging signs. The occasional plane or helicopter overhead. The helicopter just flew by. I got out of my car and waved as frantically as I could. I guess up there it's hard to notice small things on the ground. Reporter: Amber does have some advantages in the wild. The former girl scout and injuring rotc is now putting to use all the survivor skills she's learned. Using large rocks, she spells out the word "Help" to be hen by aircraft above. She also makes a fire. I can't get anything here to burn black, it all burns gray or not at all. Reporter: And luckily for her, she's brought plenty of food and water that she begins rationing meticulously. Three bottles a day should last me for at least a week and a half. Reporter: It's now Wednesday, March 15th. Amber plans to stay put until help arrives. I'm out here for -- 63 hours now. Reporter: Back in Texas, dad begins an active hunt for his daughter. I'd posted in the private Facebook. I said, look, my daughter's missing. I need some people to try to find her. This is the last place I saw her. Reporter: The problem, Stephen references amber's last known location. In New Mexico, where her app pinged him back on Saturday. The next day, suddenly amber sees a vehicle approaching and she sprints into action. Barefoot. I immediately jumped out of my car, tried to run after them, not thinking about my feet, not thinking about anything else. If this is where I get out, it doesn't matter. They didn't see me in their rear view. I'm okay. Reporter: As day four in the hot desert sun comes to a close, amber hits a low point. Almost exactly 100 hours out here now. All I can keep thinking is how much I want my daddy. And my mom. I don't want to be alone anymore. At what point did you decide that you had to rescue yourself? By about the fourth day. I figured there should have been at least a search out. But I hadn't seen anything, heard anything. Reporter: The next morning, amber takes a gigantic risk embarking on what she says would be an 11-mile desperate hike for a cell signal. It's amazing, you can see flagstaff mountains so clearly from here. That's exactly why I chose to walk that way, because flagstaff has cell towers on it. Reporter: After dialing 911 over 70 times, at last a connection. I started crying. Payi saying, please help me. Reporter: She tells the operator she's somewhere between havasu park and the highway that goes to the southern rim visitors center. She's like, in the grand canyon? No, ma'am, I'm in the desert, I've been here five days. I don't know what she was going to say because it was gone. Reporter: Just like that the call dropped. I was heartbroken in that moment. Reporter: She doesn't know it -- We had a virtually unreadable 911 call, up known location, a woman who's panicking -- Reporter: She provided just uh-uh to point Arizona's department of public safety in the right direction. Pilot Joe than nivez and paramedic Edgar vicenet retrace the route. They spot a glare, the top of amber's vehicle. Then amber's sign for the sky. I look down, we see -- must have been 20, 30-foot letters, "Help" written in rocks on the ground next to the car. This has exot got to be it. Reporter: Amber's not there but the rescue team doesn't give up hope because amber wisely had left this message. It said, "I'm not here, I walked east along the road to find cell phone signal, if you're reading this sign, please help me." Let's go. We loaded up. And continued down the road from there. Then I heard a chopper again. And that's when I saw the speck getting bigger. I look, I see someone jumping up and down in the road waving at us. I was like -- they're coming for me. Reporter: After five arduous days, amber van Hecke is stranded no more. Next thing you know I'm two feet from her. First thing that comes out of my mouth was, did you call? All I could answer was high, then ugly sobbing and holding on to him. Reporter: The crew flies her straight to the hospital in flagstaff. I had said, you know what, you do everything right besides running out of gas. If I had to get lost, I wouldn't mind getting stranded with you, you know what you're doing. Reporter: After getting treated for exposure and dehydration, an emotional phone call to her dad. I said, I was worried sick. She said, I thought you were hunting for me. I said, I was -- in the wrong place. Reporter: Two weeks since her rescue, while still healing physically and emotionally, amber says she has no regrets. I did do right things even if I did make mistakes. If I can just share those things that I did right with everyone, if that saves even one life, it's worth it. Reporter: For "Nightline," I'm Matt Gutman in flagstaff, Arizona. This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

Google knows this and the company has so far done a good job at allowing their apps and services to be used with non-Android devices, such as its Chromecast streaming device. Now the good news for SoundCloud users is that if you’ve been dying for some Chromecast support on your iOS device, you’ll be pleased to learn that SoundCloud has announced that it will now finally support Chromecast streaming on iOS. SoundCloud was already compatible with audio devices like Sonos, and for Android there was already Chromecast integration, so we guess iOS users will finally be able to enjoy the feature as well. According to SoundCloud, “What’s new? Now users with a SoundCloud Go+ subscription can stream their complete catalog through Google Chromecast. We also enabled shared playback, so multiple users can control what’s playing. Finally, we upgraded both of the mobile apps and the receiver to provide a consistent and streamlined experience.” The feature should already be live so whether you want to stream it through your TV or through speakers, that option is now finally available to you, so definitely check it out if this sounds like something you might be interested in.

By Abby Ohlheiser / The Washington Post The thing that is usually good about April Fool’s Day is that it is just one day. But 2017 has taken even that from us. Because the hoax-filled “holiday” falls on a Saturday this year, a number of this year’s jokes have rolled out early. Some pranks launched on Friday, while others went live even earlier in the week. As we have in years past, The Washington Post is keeping tabs on all the pranks we can find (or, more often, jokes that are pitched to us by brands). We’ve begun our tracking of this hoax wasteland a day early to account for all the stuff that crept into March. Below is our list of all the April Fools’ pranks on the internet this year, broken up into a few categories. Whether you’ve come here to fact check something you read online that seems a bit off, or because you just like to watch the world burn, we hope this list will be helpful over the next couple of days. And may God have mercy on our souls. Tech and Web: The weather map is just emojis at Dark Sky. DeviantArt is mostly art of biting pears now. Fontbundles.net restyled its entire website in Comic Sans in a rare display of April Fools subtlety. Reddit’s April Fool’s thing is “Place,” which is less of a joke and more of a massive test of Reddit’s ability to cooperate Kik isn’t really copying Snapchat and introducing “storyz” Yo ALSO isn’t introducing a “stories” feature Roku introduced a fake new feature that suggests snacks to pair with what you watch “Hu” isn’t a new Hulu service that shortens TV shows to 8 seconds Lyft’s “mono” wearable for hailing a car is a joke Tinder’s “live date” on Facebook Live is also a joke Doordash isn’t introducing a kids’ app called “M.O.M.” Duolingo isn’t offering an emoji course A “Netflix Live” preview video on the streaming service gives you a full 45 minutes of Will Arnett commenting on extremely boring video clips. Hinge, a relationship app, isn’t launching a “parental controls” feature Master and Dynamic isn’t really selling concrete headphones “Apocalypse Mingle” won’t really match you with a romantic partner based on how well you’d survive the End Times together Google The Google Maps app can turn into a functional game of Ms. Pac Man (They’ve done a similar prank in the past) Google Netherlands isn’t going to use the country’s windmills and machine learning to control the weather Google Gnome isn’t a creepy, outdoors-only home assistant Google won’t send “Haptic” helpers to your home to simulate smell and touch while you play VR Google isn’t introducing a bubble wrap keyboard in Japan Politics! D.C. isn’t getting a Joe Biden-themed pop up bar A fitness tracker company isn’t turning Trump’s border wall into a climbing wall George Takei, who has a history of elaborate April Fools’ pranks, is *not* running for Congress. This one tricked a lot of people — including some entertainment news sites (come onnn) — until he revealed it was a joke several hours later. Miscellaneous Brands Thinkgeek (takes a deep breath) isn’t selling a Hot Pocket sleeping bag, a swear jar, a tentacuddle wrap, a Where’s Waldo parody featuring Barb from Stranger Things, a “swim desk”, a full-body snake temporary tattoo (a la “Westworld”, the movie “Shazaam” starring Sinbad (it doesn’t exist), a bike horn of Gondor, or a “YAAS Cat-apult” Lexus doesn’t have a “Lane Valet” that will move other cars out of the way for you. Eau de Chlôrine, a perfume that makes you smell like a swimming pool, isn’t real. Plated isn’t launching a perfume line that makes you smell like food. Coffee-mate didn’t make a coffee-flavored creamer. Auntie Annie’s isn’t launching a rebrand that puts a Snapchat filter on their logo. Women can’t rent a fully-furnished storage unit as a “She Shed” to escape their families. Progressive isn’t selling insurance for people who are moving to Mars. Whopper toothpaste 🙁 You can’t ship yourself to a friend in a “man freight” Jim Beam isn’t going to start selling canned beans “Chugg” isn’t a real energy drink for college kids Kars4Kids isn’t really a service that gives cars to children so they can drive them A doll company isn’t selling Voodoo dolls The viral “Nanodrop” ad with Paris Hilton in it is a Sodastream prank Carrabba’s, the Italian food chain, isn’t selling its pasta sauce as a beauty mask Sorry, FreshDirect isn’t selling “pitless avocados” “Speed of light” USB cable doesn’t actually exist Tripping hasn’t struck a deal with the White House to rent out its rooms while Trump is out of town on the weekends Groupon hasn’t joined the flat earth movement Bush’s beans isn’t selling jelly beans in a can You can’t use an app to destroy all the clutter in your apartment KFC isn’t launching sushi in New Zealand Mike’s Harder isn’t selling a “Keg in a Can” (this is primarily a visual gag) A tool company isn’t launching a baby accessories line Honda horn emoji are fake, but maybe not the worst idea? A car history tracker can’t also check your potential date’s history Toilet paper blinds are fake Snickers isn’t selling Knickers Delta won’t fly you to Mars Virgin Trains isn’t going to start tattooing tickets on their customers’ bodies Animal jokes Sugarfina isn’t selling dog treats now The “Harambed” isn’t real Turkey Hill didn’t introduce Cowsonly.com, a dating site only for cows Tough Mudder isn’t starting Puppy Mudder, an athletic event for dogs You’ll never actually be able to buy a watch made out of your pet’s fur Amazon’s Alexa can’t understand your pets now Trulia isn’t launching a real estate service for pets Cheapflights isn’t selling “Catflights,” or flights that come with a cat companion Puzzles for pets are fake A digital retailer isn’t selling a DIY goat soap-making kit (that includes a goat) Freshwater dolphins haven’t returned to the Finger Lakes Petcube isn’t selling “bum” covers for your pets The Wildlife Conservation Society isn’t raising money to buy tiny little raincoats for sloths iFixit didn’t release a tool kit for hamsters These rats can’t detect “man flu,” but can actually detect land mines, apparently. A shirt made out of the bodies of cockroaches is fake, and will not give you cockroach-like enhancements You can’t buy cockroach milk either Fake wearables, “smart” items, and AI jokes: Wayfair isn’t selling a smart sofa. Cargurus isn’t introducing a bot that lets autonomous cars choose their driver. Quilted Northern isn’t launching a wearable to record all your bathroom activity. You can’t buy a holograph-projecting drone to attend meetings for you. Alamo isn’t launching a line of smart, “self-vacationing” rental cars KFC Canada isn’t making a “smart” bucket T-Mobile isn’t selling a “full-body wearable” called “T-Mobile ONEsie” Petco didn’t make a pooper scooper that is powered by a drone A smart hibernation pod isn’t real (and it’s also not a prank that appears to be done by Samsung) An adult toy company isn’t going to start doing drone deliveries Fake “news” and history The National Museum of American History launched a fake Smells of American History project, but also created an actual research section on historical perfumes because it can’t stop being a museum, even on April Fools Day. Traveling in a straight line through Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas and Louisiana won’t conjure a homicidal elf, and no one ever believed that it would. The World Wildlife Fund has not discovered a polar bear living in the Outer Hebrides in Scotland David Attenborough isn’t going in a different direction for his next documentary Kellyanne Conway isn’t the commencement speaker at the University of Albany this year Messing with children “Blorskee” “Tangeteen” and “Speekuzslmn” (pronounced “speak-ew”) are not real words, much to the relief of the students who took this joke spelling test in class.

Hot Topics: Pearl Street Mall turnover Neil Gorsuch Newton Running store closes Boulder considers Xcel settlement SUV vs. house News tips Print   Email   Font Resize Opinion: Columnists Jim Martin: Beauty of Boulder Valley has been its undoing By Jim Martin Posted:   03/30/2017 07:40:40 PM MDT Jim Martin For the Camera "Is this the end of Boulder as we know it?" Steve Pomerance asked in his March 26 opinion column in the Daily Camera. I can answer that: Yes, the old Boulder is dead, with recent developments delivering the final blows. This is greatly distressing to me, someone that has lived here since 1961 and who has seen the unstoppable changes that surgically remove a city's charm. It was a sleepy little college community then, driven primarily by local businesses, a much-smaller University of Colorado, NCAR and Rocky Flats. Those halcyon days are gone. Boulder took many meaningful steps to control growth, such as the blue line, Boulder Valley Comprehensive Plan, the 55-foot height limit for buildings, the Danish Plan and expansion of open space. But people continued to migrate here. Many people embrace Boulder's unique culture. Still, the battle now is to keep it affordable for the middle class, what with the average home price now topping $1 million. We're paying the price for several well-intentioned initiatives that instead have limited the housing supply as the demand has risen. Much of this can be attributed to the jobs/housing imbalance. And the imminent arrival of 1,500 Google employees not only will blow the roof off of our housing costs, it also will worsen access to mountain trails, road congestion and parking (witness Chautauqua Park contemplating parking charges). Advertisement The first big change came in the mid-1960s, when IBM decided to locate a manufacturing plant in Boulder County. IBM's presence helped the university to achieve significant growth that continues. One result is that IBM produced many spinoff small companies that became big, such as Exabyte and StorageTek. In 1980, System Development Corp. tried to move its world headquarters to a mesa seven miles south of Boulder, but the city fought the move and eventually prevented it by buying the land for open space. Yes, that's how strongly Boulder wanted to control growth. But the day the music died was not Feb. 3, 1959, in Clear Lake, Iowa. For Boulder, it was Dec. 9, 2014, when the City Council capitulated to the city Planning Board's wishes and chose not to call up the decision as to whether Google should build a 330,000-square-foot campus capable of accommodating more than 1,500 workers in the center of the city. I thank Mary Young, who was the only council member then who expressed public concerns about Google's plans. The City Council should have talked more about the viability of allowing Google to proceed, as well as the future of Boulder, particularly its population density. The Planning Board deals with growth and use of land; it can approve projects, which it did for Google. Its decision is final unless the City Council calls up the board's decision. Instead, the council short-circuited one of the biggest planning decisions ever in the city (remember this in the upcoming Intergovernmental Agreement discussions). Purportedly, Google chose the four-acre parcel at 30th Street and Pearl Street because it was located at the center of the transportation hub. The high-density housing area cries out for a hub, but the existing one hasn't met expectations. RTD's failure to bring the much-touted rail connection here is one reason. And now, this is not on anyone's radar screen. Incidentally, Google is leasing another 30,000 square feet of office space in Boulder. Google is on track to be one of the top five employers in Boulder County. Its complex will be one of Google's largest U.S. locations. And the average annual Google salary far exceeds similar companies in Boulder County. Dave Krieger wrote this in December 2014: "Boulder would do well to study what is happening in San Francisco and come up with strategies to avoid the same result here. ... [T]here is a real risk of Boulder becoming essentially a gated community with only the wealthy living inside and the many workers who support the residents' lavish lifestyles commuting in from worker-bee satellite communities." Many people are oblivious to this, as evidenced by the latest U.S. Census numbers. The Flatirons backdrop is one of the most breathtaking sights anywhere. That's the one thing that has not changed. The beauty of the Boulder Valley has been its undoing. That's why people are so adamant about controlling growth. And that's why I'm troubled that the 2014 City Council abdicated to an unelected board on the Google decision. I've seen the end of Boulder as I knew it. Figuratively, we have paved paradise. Now, many people lack the code to get inside the gate.

Will post-Brexit Britain let it continue? Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Martin Moore Saturday 1 April 2017 19.05 EDT As Brexit begins and the government starts the laborious process of cutting and pasting the repeal bill, what should Britain do about the tech giants? There is a fissure growing between European and US attitudes towards these global super-platforms – “the Gafa” as Brussels calls them (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon) – and the UK will soon need to decide on which side it sits. Will we continue to let these corporations and their services grow unchecked? Will we try to challenge their dominance and impose obligations on them? Or will we “take back control” and find a third way? The approach we take to Google, Facebook and their Silicon Valley peers will affect us all. Who can honestly say that they go through a day without using one of these companies’ services? We wake to their alarms on our phones; we check our emails on their platforms; we do our shopping on their browsers; we navigate by their maps; they host our virtual identities. What we do about them is not just an economic or competition question, nor simply about privacy – important though these aspects are. It is a question about what sort of society we want and what sort of politics. It is a question that will help define the type of country we live in, post Brexit. This is because these tech superpowers are playing an increasing number of civic roles in our lives that affect our ability to participate in society and to communicate freely. With these civic roles they gain civic powers. This includes the power to communicate news, the power to enable collective action and the power to influence how we vote. How did you find this article? Maybe you are reading it in a printed version of the Observer. If so, you are in a minority. Perhaps you found it at theguardian.com. Or maybe, like more and more of us, you came to it via Facebook, Twitter, Google News, or another social media platform. More than half of us now use social media as a regular source of news. Newspapers are losing their role as editors and gatekeepers. On Facebook, for example, the news agenda is not set by an editor, but by an algorithm. The implications are profound. The brave new world of platform news is one of DIY news. It is a world in which we – the user – produce, publish and promote the news ourselves. It is a world in which we rely on our peers and on those we follow to discover stories. It is one in which we verify news rather than relying on established news organisations and journalists to do it for us. For some, this is an exciting, democratised new digital world. For others, it sounds exhausting, chaotic – a world of fake news and filter bubbles. As well as relying on the tech giants for our news, we are using them to organise ourselves. This includes running political campaigns, fundraising for social causes or co-ordinating collective action. It might mean as little as changing our profile picture or adding a hashtag to a tweet (#wearethe48, #brexitbritain, #remoaners). It could mean trying to save a local library or stop a bypass. Or it could mean starting a major protest movement. Wael Ghonim, who was closely involved in the Egyptian revolution of 2011, thanked Mark Zuckerberg. “This revolution started online,” he said. “This revolution started on Facebook.” Organising our political activity through these tech platforms will become the norm. For some, it has already. But are we, as a society, comfortable with this? Are we happy that they know which political causes we share or like, who we donate to, which we join, and who we are associated with? These are not public spaces, they are commercial private spaces, with their own rules and their own means of enforcing them. The tech giants’ dominance means that they are also becoming central to election and referendum campaigns. The Conservative party did not spend anything campaigning on Facebook in the run-up to the 2010 election, but in 2015 it spent more than £1.2m. “Facebook is a phenomenal campaigning platform”, said Craig Elder, who was the Conservative’s digital director during the campaign, “and we really, really exploited that”. During the referendum campaign, both the remain and leave campaigns relied heavily on the tech platforms to deliver their messages – including provocative and emotive videos. Yet, the way these platforms are being used, and the messages that are being sent through them, challenge both the principles and rules that have made British elections fair and open since the 19th century. As we spend more and more of our time using these platforms and their services, so their power grows. Those of us who use Facebook or one of its subsidiaries like Instagram, WhatsApp or Messenger, now spend almost an hour a day on them. Commanding so much of our attention means that they can start to take on public functions. After the terror unleashed by Khalid Masood on 22 March, Facebook activated Safety Check, prompting those in the vicinity of Westminster to alert their network that they were safe. Facebook does the same after natural disasters. This is clearly of public benefit, but it is also the type of activity we used to associate with a public broadcaster like the BBC, rather than with a private commercial company. None of this would be such an issue were it not for the remarkable dominance of these companies. Despite their youth – established in 2004, Facebook is barely a teenager – these organisations now bestride our world like colossi. Their dominance stretches far beyond the commercial world into the political and the civic. We therefore need to decide how best to respond to them. Will Britain follow the route taken by Europe, and challenge the power of these tech superpowers? The European commission began antitrust action against Google in 2015. The German government is drafting legislation threatening fines of up to €50m if social media platforms do not remove offensive content. Will we take the laissez-faire route of the US and simply accept the dominance of these organisations as the price of a free market? Or will we find a third way, perhaps more progressive than either Europe or the US? As we untangle the Gordian knot of Brexit, Britain will need to decide.

Google always does a great job, from the Pokemon Google Maps overlay to a smart mailbox, but there are a few from other companies worth mentioning. Here's a rundown of all the hillarious (or strange) tech-related April Fools Day jokes from around the web. Google Gnome One of Google's product launches from last year was the Google Home, a $129 smart speaker with Google Assistant. Now the company is teasing the "Google Gnome," an outside version of the Home. You can ask it weather questions, let it control your lawnmower and other tools, and even dress it up in accessories. The Google Gnome has a page on the Google Store, but unfortunately you can't buy it. I really want a rain coat for my Google Home, though. Mrs. Pac-Man in Google Maps For April Fools' 2015, Google added Pac-Man into Google Maps and Ingress. This year, Mrs Pac-Man is invading Google Maps. For regions of the world already on April 1st, a new Mrs. Pac-Man button is visible on the mobile app. You then have to control Mrs. Pac-Man on real-life streets, and of course, outrun the Ghosts. Google's Bubble Wrap Keyboard (English subtitles are available) Google Japan's prank is pretty funny - it's a bubble wrap keyboard. The idea is to pop bubbles on a bubble wrap sheet to form words, then feed the sheet through a reader to send the message. Some of the bubble wrap sheets are even scented. Google Assistant Google has plenty of Easter Eggs in Google Assistant, and as you might expect, there's one for April Fools' Day too. When asked, Assistant will offer advice on how not to get pranked, such as "If something seems too good to be true today, it probably is." Google Wind Google's Netherlands division has its own April Fools' Day gag, named 'Google Wind.' The idea is to use machine learning to control the weather, using Holland's famous windmills. I'll admit, this one is pretty great. Netflix Live Will Arnet has been in plenty of Netflix original content, from BoJack Horseman to A Series of Unfortunate Events. For April Fools' Day, Netflix is proud to share 'Netflix Live', which is nearly an hour of Arnett commentating ordinary events like toasting bread and completing a crossword puzzle. It's actually funnier than it sounds. You can watch the full thing here (a Netflix subscription is required). T-Mobile ONEsie T-Mobile's prank is a onesie, with "full-body coverage" and a built-in 4G LTE hotspot. You can actually buy it for $40, but the real one doesn't have any tech inside it. Hulu Hu With the claim that the human attention span has "dropped to eight seconds," Hulu has released 'Hu.' It's just a library of short clips from existing Hulu content, and you actually need an account to see them. This is probably the lamest April Fools' Day gag in the list - better luck next year, guys. OnePlus Dash drink OnePlus is really proud of its Dash Charge feature, even to the point of enlisting celebrities to talk about it. For April Fools', the company made real Dash Charge energy drinks. You can find our review of the drink here. Lyft Mono For April Fools' Day, Lyft has announced the 'Lyft Mono.' It's a wearable glove, vaguely resembling a Nintendo Power Glove. This gag is actually real, and once you put it on and get the app, sticking out your thumb will hail a Lyft cab. You can sign up to for a chance to get one here. Honor BFF We all need some positive reinforcement every now and then, right? Honor thinks so, and created the Honor BFF. This imaginary phone uses machine learning to periodically give you compliments and motivation. Hopefully it ships with Android 7.1 Nougat. Google Haptic Helpers This is probably my favorite gag so far. In order to create a more realistic virtual reality experience, you can schedule a "haptic helper" to come to your house and help create a more realistic environment. Just watch the video, it's hilarious. Amazon Petlexa Alexa is cool and all, but your furry friends need one too. As the name implies, Petlexa is Alexa for your pets. Contour by SlickWraps Putting a skin on your phone or tablet is too much work. For April Fool's Day, Slickwraps is teasing the 'Countour' - a machine that sprays on device skins. Frankly, I'm not sure if this is actually real or not, but there is a page for it on SlickWrap's store. Nvidia GTX G-Assist How many times have you been playing an online game, only to be interrupted by someone in real life? NVIDIA has made the 'G Assist,' a flash drive that can take over for you if you're busy. It can also help you beat boss battles, and provides periodic reminders to consume energy drinks. More information and a video can be found here. Google's data center on Mars If you have important data, you need a backup. That's why Google announced its first interplanetary data center, named "Ziggy Stardust," on the Google Cloud Platform Blog today. Located in the Gale Crater on Mars, it will store a cache of data from Earth to prevent irrecoverable loss when a planetary disaster strikes. Google hopes to finish the data center by 2018. LineageOS' mascot CyanogenMod's mascot, Cid, was one of the most recognizable icons in the Android community. As the spiritual successor to CyanogenMod, LineageOS has created its own mascot - 'Ink'. The project also announced 'Br0zip,' an artificial intelligence that can port LineageOS to any device in no time at all. Chromebook accessories Even though most Chromebooks can now run Android apps, you still can't use your Chromebook like an Android phone/tablet for all use cases. Until now, that is. Google has announced a Chromebook Groupie Stick (seen above), a Chromebook Cardboard headset, and a Chromebook armband. See the company's blog post for more info. Exynos Yoga Processor Remember when curved phones were a thing? Maybe we'll see more in the coming months, because Samsung has just unveiled the Exynos Yoga Processor - the first flexible mobile SoC. Anyone up for a Galaxy Flex? Carved screen protector Carved is a small Indiana-based phone case company, but now they are working on a wooden screen protector. Why hasn't this been done before? I'll take ten. I'm Feeling Woof/I'm Feeling Meow By force-touching the Google app icon in iOS, you can select "I'm Feeling Woof" or "I'm Feeling Meow." These give your pets access to the stuff they care about - from dog food to balls of yarn. More info can be found on Google's blog post. Waze maps for Mars According to the company's blog, Waze is has begun to map the surface of Mars. Certain members of the Waze community will also be sent to the Red Planet to more accurately map the surface. JerryRigEverything's NoPhone video If you haven't heard about it, the NoPhone is a solid piece of plastic designed to simulate the feeling of a phone in your pocket. I'm not really sure if anyone uses it, but JerryRigEverything is happy to break it just as much as any other phone. Google Translate for Heptapod B Using machine learning, Google Translate can now decrypt messages written in Heptapod B - the language from the film Arrival. On an unrelated note, it looks like someone from Google is still rocking a Nexus 10. See Google's blog post for more info. Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s ASUS has an April Fools gag too - the Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s Veritas Blue Limited Special Edition. I would probably buy this phone. MKBHD's Nokia 3310 review You may have heard about the updated Nokia 3310, but it turns out the original is an amazing smartphone. Okay, maybe not, but the video is pretty funny. Open GApps Femto Do you need to flash the latest Gapps package on your device, but you don't have a stable network connection? Not to worry, the Open GApps Femto package is here to help. It uses the United States HAARP service (which is not real, but just pretend) to download the latest GApps package. You can find more info at the GApps blog.   That concludes our coverage of April Fools' Day in the tech world. Let us know in the comments below which gag you liked the most!

Yeah they actuqally had me going until I compared a whois of kodi.tv vs kickasstorrents.com, a site that actually was seized. The whois data would show that it is not official. Derik Taylor So this is one I find interesting. Could it technically be a criminal offense to falsify a domain seizure?

Corbin Davenport Yep, that had me laughing too. AdrianFDiratama . How about JG I'd actually like to see Google produce the Google Gnome.... All they'd need to do is add a battery (and Qi charging) to a Google Home and stick it in a new Gnome shell... Make sure its IP68 and maybe even MIL-STD-810G certified. It'd be a fun little gadget to put on the picnic table of your next summer back yard get together. Pump out some tunes, order pizza & Ubers for everyone to go home in, etc... Or take out when you work in the garden & don't want to get your phone dirty... Maybe even produce one with an LTE radio (and GPS). Then you could take it out of WiFi range camping.

Interesting idea, but not sure why you wouldn't do most of the things it would do on your phone. Some specific use cases like you mentioned but beyond those, idk.

The sick footage has been available on Google-owned video website YouTube for the last six months. PA:Press Association 3 Google, which owns YouTube, has now removed the video but it was available online for six months Despite being called How To Pierce A Stab Proof Vest, and being uploaded onto a channel with 120,000 subscribers, the video was not taken down until the Mail on Sunday alerted Google this week. It is claimed that the video generated thousands of pounds in advertising revenue for the tech giant. Jörg Sprave, a German weapons obsessive, made the video and it was easy to find online.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Reserve fitness classes in the US through Google maps, search, By Ida Torres - April 1, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Keeping fit is never as simple as just eating the right food and exercising on your own. Sometimes you need to actually enroll in classes for motivation and also extra training. Google is making it a bit easier for you to push yourself and book that fitness related class in your area that you’ve always wanted to attend. You can book it through several Google products, specifically Google Search, Google Maps, and Reserve with Google, whether on desktop or mobile. When you go to the Reserve with Google site, you will be able to search for gyms or fitness studios that are around your area, or the area that you will be in. There are of course various filters that you can use so it will be able to show you better results. You will also get recommendations for new classes, just in case you’re on the lookout for something different than your normal routine. But you can also use the service to book the classes you already know and love. When you’re looking for a class through “old school” Google Search or even going through Maps as well, you will also be able to not just bookmark it, but actually reserve, book, and pay, all without having to leave the app you’re in at the moment. Google worked with several scheduling providers to be able to bring real-time class inventory to its users. So now that you are able to reserve classes easily, the only thing missing would be your determination to attend said classes. Well, at least you will be one step closer to actually doing it so book that fitness class today.

On April Fool's Day, Justin Trudeau channelled his inner fighter with a lighthearted tweet aimed at former actor — and classmate — Matthew Perry.  (FRED CHARTRAND / THE CANADIAN PRESS)   By Andrej IvanovStaff Reporter Sat., April 1, 2017 Fake news may have turned the news industry sour on the April Fool’s Day fun this year, but politicians and companies across the world donned their jester hat for a slew of pranks. From Justin Trudeau’s call for a rematch to Google’s newest home assistant, here are some of our favourites: Trudeau v. Perry II: Payback can hurt, especially if you beat up someone who later becomes prime minister. Justin Trudeau had revenge in mind for his April Fool’s prank, tweeting out a faux challenge: “Who hasn’t wanted to punch Chandler? How about a rematch Matthew Perry?” Article Continued Below Former Friends actor Matthew Perry, who starred as the neurotic Chandler Bing, recently told Jimmy Kimmel he and musician Chris Murray used to beat up Trudeau back when they went to the same school in Ottawa. Perry claimed the beatings were motivated by jealousy for the young Trudeau’s prowess in sports. Read more: Here’s what it’s like to punch the prime minister Rona Ambrose’s Airbnb gag: For a measly sum of the Liberal budget deficit — $29.4 Billion — you and a guest can stay for one night at Stornoway, the lavish residence of the leader of the opposition. That’s according to Conservative Leader Rona Ambrose’s fake Airbnb listing: Potential guests have a few things to keep in mind: Friends can sleep in the spare room above the garage; It’s only the best Alberta beef for dinner; Breakfast comes with smoothies on tap; No books? No problems! Read the gloomy economic forecasts and tax hikes coming from the Liberal budget; And of course, BYON — that’s bring your own nanny (there are no government-funded nannies at Stornoway). Google Gnome: Your garden can now be automated just like your living room. Google’s April Fools’ prank is Google Gnome, a play on the company’s voice-activated assistant Google Home. The gadget can respond to voice-commands to mow your lawn, turn on the hose you’re already holding or even tell you which way the wind is blowing. The TTC’s new proof of purchase: On April Fool’s on the TTC, pop cans count as POP, or proof of purchase. Be ready to show the cans to inspectors, but please, don’t shake your proof of purchase. Amazon Alexa becomes Petlexa: If your pet felt neglected by Alexa, the artificial intelligence inside Amazon Echo, the company’s voice-activated home assistant, it’ll be thrilled by the April Fools’ upgrade: Petlexa. Now Sir Meowington can order sushi and Rex can order a new frame to replace the one he just broke with the ball-thrower. WestJet’s new name: WestJet announced a big change with a stereotypically Canadian April Fools’ video. The prank shows the vice-president of marketing Richard Bartrem playing hockey, apologizing, being courteous and every other stereotype under the sun before announcing the company’s patriotic new name: Canada Air. The video ends with Bartrem conceding that, yes, perhaps the name-change clashes with existing copyrights. A dating app from Pizza Pizza: Why meet the love of your life based on silly things like looks, hair, and skin softness, when you can meet them based on what really counts. Pizza Pizza’s April Fools’ prank is a dating app: Pizza Pals, where people can hook up based on their favourite toppings. Feel like you’re the only pineapple lover in Toronto? Pizza Pals has your back, available on the Apple Shop and Doodle Play. LYFT’s electronic thumb: LYFT, the American ride-sharing service, rolled out a prank straight from the ’80s. The MONO is a giant thumb-glove — the device is a take Nintendo’s Power Glove, featured in the 1989 teen comedy The Wizard — that lets wearers easily hitch a ride. “Raise. Request. Ride.” “To request election interference, press 3” The top April Fool’s gag goes to the Russian Foreign Ministry’s new automated voicemail. The message instructs callers: “To arrange a call from a Russian diplomat to your political opponents, press 1. To use the services of Russian hackers, press 2. To request election interference, press 3 and wait until the next election campaign.” The message concludes that all calls are “recorded for quality improvement and training purposes.” The joke follows Russian President Vladimir Putin’s firm denial that his country meddles in the 2016 U.S. presidential election: “Read my lips — No,” he said.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Clarity is a touchscreen Android speaker with Alexa and Google Assistant (crowdfunding) 03/31/2017 at 5:00 PM by Brad Linder 1 Comment Looking for a smart home speaker, but can’t decide between an Amazon Echo with the Alexa voice service or a Google Home with Google Assistant? Why not both? At least that seems to be the thinking behind the Clarity Speaker. It’s basically a familiar-looking speaker with a 7 inch touchscreen display and Android software. But the key selling point for the Clarity is that it’s supposed to support Alexa, and Google Assistant (or at least the “OK Google” voice service that’s still more widely available on Android devices for now). Clarity is up for pre-order for $149 and up through a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo. The full retail price is expected to be $199. The device has a 1280 x 800 pixel display, stereo 5 watt speakers and far field mics that can pick up your voice even if you’re not standing near the speaker. Clarity’s speaker measures about 12.8″ x 6.3″ x 4.3″ and weighs 2 pounds. It has a 2MP camera for making video calls, a quad-core processor, 16GB of storage, a microSD card reader, and dual-band WiFi and Bluetooth. It runs Android 6.0 with a launcher app featuring large icons to make the system look a bit more appliance-like than a typical Android tablet. There’s also a 1600 mAh battery that Clarity says should provide up to 6 hours of audio playback time, or up to 2.5 hours of video playback. While there are plenty of Android tablets that can do better, this isn’t really a tablet. It’s a speaker that’s meant to be used around the house, so it’s probably fair to think of the battery as a bonus feature that lets you move the speaker from room to room without turning it off, or use it unplugged for brief periods. Chinese device makers have been cranking out similar hardware for a few years, but the promised support for both Alexa and Google voice services makes this model a bit unusual. The question is whether you actually need both?   Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 1 Comment on "Clarity is a touchscreen Android speaker with Alexa and Google Assistant (crowdfunding)" Login with Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Notify of new replies to this comment Notify of new replies to this comment Sort by:   newest | oldest | most voted Member Nexus Fantismo Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

The vile video was online for six months before the outrage and could be viewed for days afterwards, despite widespread warnings that UK jihadis use such material for training. The seven-minute film, entitled How To Pierce A Stab Proof Vest, demonstrates how to plunge a knife through protective body armour and has been viewed nearly a quarter of a million times – generating thousands of pounds in advertising revenue. The video was made by German weapons obsessive Jörg Sprave, who proudly displays on the wall of his living room a framed award from YouTube for attracting a million subscribers to his films. German weapons obsessive Jörg Sprave, pictured, uploaded a video to YouTube showing how to kill someone wearing a stab vest The sickening footage, pictured, showed him demonstrating how and where to use a knife on someone wearing body armour The Mail on Sunday easily found the film online despite promises made last week by YouTube owners Google to crack down on extremist material. Last night, Home Secretary Amber Rudd condemned the video and demanded that YouTube take action to ensure similar films are banned. She said: ‘We will not tolerate the internet being used to hide terrorist activities or, as The Mail on Sunday has revealed, provide information to assist them in their terrible activities.  'Following my meeting last week, major internet companies including Google have agreed to work together in an international forum to ensure this sort of material isn’t available. I will want to see early and effective progress.’ RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 2 Next All 12 people arrested over the Westminster terror attack...

Share this article Share And Labour’s Yvette Cooper, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said: ‘The idea that YouTube and Google should profit from something so depraved is appalling.  'When are Google going to get their act together and stop making money out of vile hatred?’ The revelation comes little more than a week after Khalid Masood mounted the pavement on Westminster Bridge in a hired car, killing three people, before killing PC Palmer by stabbing him through the chest. Yesterday, after being contacted by The Mail on Sunday, YouTube removed the video but it had already been online for more than six months, earning thousands of pounds in advertising revenue from companies including Netflix – though they cannot choose the YouTube videos in which their adverts appear. Sprave was even given an award by YouTube for attracting 1,000,000 subscribers to his channel, despite widespread warnings that UK jihadis use such material for training In the film, Sprave stands in a wooded area of his back garden in southern Germany explaining to viewers how they can modify a knife and its handle so it can be used to pierce a protective vest. The one he uses is similar to the vests worn by Metropolitan Police officers. He thrusts the knife through the stab vest which is attached to a makeshift dummy. ‘Wow, look at that, I pierced the safety vest,’ he boasts, adding: ‘As you can see, it definitely pierced deep enough to cause major harm.’ One member of the public commenting on the video wrote: ‘Thanks to you, a lot of people now know how to kill a police officer.’  When another YouTube viewer questioned why Sprave would teach people how to pierce a stab vest, he replied chillingly: ‘Because I can, obviously.’ And another outraged viewer wrote: ‘I work in corrections [prisons]. You are putting my life in danger.’ Sprave, 51, started making films on YouTube as a hobby around eight years ago. He became so successful with his channel that in January he gave up his job with a German electronics firm. Yesterday, when approached by The Mail on Sunday, Sprave, who has 120,000 subscribers in the UK, defended the video.  Interviewed at his former hunting lodge home in the village of Rothenburg near Heidelberg, he said: ‘I just want to show that people who wear these vests should not feel invincible. ‘They are still vulnerable. These vests should not be described as stab proof.’ Wearing a black T-shirt emblazoned with the slogan Fight Fire With Fire, he added: ‘I just test things and make videos to review all kinds of things like cameras, knives and air guns.  'If they change police equipment because I have shown it is vulnerable then I may be saving some lives. ‘I feel sorry about what happened to the policeman in London. He should have had a gun to protect himself.’ Police in the German state of Hessen were unavailable to comment yesterday. An unofficial police source in the local town of Erbach said: ‘We had to check on him once, but we found nothing wrong.’ Sprave’s other videos include an 11-minute clip entitled: ‘Shooting right through police riot gear?’ which has been viewed more than half a million times.  The video has been taken down days after terrorist Khalid Masood, left, fatally stabbed PC Keith Palmer, pictured right with a member of the public, in Westminster, and it the stab vest it showed was similar to one worn by the Met Police officer on the day of his death During this video – which YouTube has also now removed – Sprave uses a custom-made weapon to fire a steel-tipped arrow through a German police riot shield.  ‘Well, I think that policeman is dead,’ he says, inspecting the damage. Internet users clicking on the stab video last week saw adverts automatically play on different occasions for Netflix, internet security firm OwlDetect and property website eMoov.  An advert for Finnish music festival Flow Festival 2017 played before the riot shield video. Those who post videos typically receive up to $7.60 (£6.08) per 1,000 views of an advert, meaning Sprave would have made nearly £1,500 from the stab video and over £3,000 from the riot shield video. YouTube would have earned approximately £1,200 for the stab video and about £2,500 for the riot shield video. Calum Macleod, vice-chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said: ‘That anyone thinks it is acceptable to share content that could further put police officers, or any emergency service workers, in harm is deplorable, disappointing and upsetting.’ Yesterday, YouTube said it had permanently removed both videos but refused to reveal how much money it had made from them.  A spokeswoman said: ‘We have clear policies against inciting violence and harmful or dangerous activities and remove content that breaks our guidelines when we’re made aware of it.’ HOW KNIFE 'EXPERT' WAS HONOURED BY WEB GIANT  Sprave makes money by posting his horrific videos on YouTube.  Adverts, from companies including Netflix, left, automatically show when the videos are watched and Sprave makes money from each 1,000 views.  YouTube, owned by Google, also takes a cut from the advertisers.  Sprave made thousands from the video of the stab vest attack, seen by a quarter of a million viewers, and another clip showing how to pierce a police riot shield, seen by half a million viewers.  Videos are his main source of income and he’s won an award from YouTube, right, for attracting a million subscribers to his channel, called Slingshot. Sprave makes money by posting his horrific videos on YouTube thanks to adverts from companies including Netflix, pictured A spokesman for OwlDetect said: ‘We were not aware that our product was being advertised before this video. ‘We have stopped this advertising immediately and will review the ways in which we advertise with Google and YouTube.’ Russell Quirk, founder and CEO of eMoov, said: ‘We and other advertisers have no control over which content these [adverts] are associated with.  'We have contacted Google and have demanded our adverts are removed immediately.’ A Flow Festival spokeswoman said: ‘We will contact Google and ask them to blacklist this video on our campaign so that Flow Festival video ads cannot be displayed in connection to the videos by this specific YouTube user account.’ A Netflix spokesman said: ‘We employ numerous filters to avoid having our content appear on sites or videos that clearly don’t represent us or our values. ‘While that works well most of the time, there are a small number of instances where it doesn’t and we are working closely with Google to close that gap further.’  Share or comment on this article e-mail 335 shares Most watched News videos Woman freaks out at restaurant and accuses couple of having sex 'Give me my keys you c***!': Biker attacks cyclist for stealing Shocking video of truck dangerously swerving on highway Trump exits oval office without signing executive orders on trade Villepinte: Horrific moment of huge explosion at carnival in France Live boa constrictor studded with quills after porcupine attack Jaw-dropping moment a great white shark catches a seal Nick Kyrgios yells at crowd jeering him during clash with Federer MASSIVE wave hurls sailboat and its four passengers into pier Shocking moment of 'accidental explosion' at popular Paris carnival Roger Federer's wife taunts Nick Kyrgios during Miami Open clash Most adorable kitties get treats when they ring their bells Heartbreak as remains of 'America's Maddie McCann' are...

The online archive, which spanned millions of digital pages covering roughly 120 years of local history in city newspapers, had been available at MPL since 2009 through the Google News Archive. The database was removed without warning, leaving researchers, genealogists, and other library patrons in the lurch. But Chris Stegman, who took over as Milwaukee Journal Sentinel president in June, said the digital archive’s disappearance was nothing more than an unfortunate mix-up caused by a switch to a new computer system at the newspaper, which was purchased by the Gannett Corporation in April. “That’s hopefully going to be resolved soon,” he said of the archive’s removal, adding that he could not pinpoint a more precise date for its return. Google will no longer host the online material, Stegman added. “The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel has a partnership with NewsBank to develop and maintain a digitized, permanent collection of our valuable archival information,” Stegman wrote in a September 14 e-mail to LJ. “This is a massive development project involving digitizing millions of pages of microfilm. Once completed, NewsBank will provide the archive service to our newspaper and community, including the Milwaukee Public Library.” He continued: “NewsBank and the Milwaukee Public Library are in discussion to establish the business terms for this service. The library currently has a no-fee trial of the sample collection; library patron access to the archive is subject to further negotiation and agreement between NewsBank and the library.” Loss left a gap Paula Kiely, MPL’s director, said the sudden loss of the archive caused no small amount of consternation for some MPL patrons, who were using it as a valuable research tool. “I imagine it’s like losing your hard drive,” she said, adding that library officials had no previous information as to when, or if, the archive would return or why it went away in the first place. “For some, the resource affected their work lives; for others, a connection with their families. Some have indicated that research they’ve done over an extended period of time and bookmarked—for some, hundreds of articles—has been lost to them. We hope when full access is returned that these bookmarks will also be restored.” Cathy Markwiese, MPL’s metadata librarian, said she tried diligently after August 16 to contact Google seeking an explanation for the archive’s removal, but made very little headway. Google’s press office did respond to LJ’s separate inquiry. “Google just hosted the content and the Milwaukee Journal requested the removal because they will soon be offering the archive via their own product,” wrote Maggie Shiels, a corporate communications officer with the Mountain View, CA, tech giant. Content contribution There’s another reason why MPL officials were alarmed to see the Google content vanish: The library had donated almost a third of the source material used to construct that archive in the first place. In 2009, when Google began digitizing microfilm and other perishable sources to create the newspaper database, the company found it lacked a significant amount of Milwaukee material. MPL, it turned out, had a large trove of much-needed microfilm, Kiely said, and the library board voted to turn it over free of charge in the name of building a modern sustainable online resource. Markwiese said that contribution of “master film” amounted to about 30 percent of what Google would eventually offer in its Milwaukee newspaper archive. This included Milwaukee Journal pages from 1910–20 and the Milwaukee Sentinel from 1837–1909. Those now-defunct dailies merged in 1995 to form the Journal Sentinel. A costly competitor The recent disappearance of that Google archive proved puzzling to MPL officials for another reason. For months, they have been wrestling with whether or not to buy a digital newspaper database from Florida-based NewsBank. The Journal Sentinel has been working with NewsBank for the last year or two to build a brand new newspaper archive. MPL officials have already been provided with large samples of this online material (which the library has not made available to patrons), Markwiese said. The librarian readily concedes the new archive has fewer chronological gaps, offers easier-to-read images, and is generally more user-friendly than the older Google product. It’s also much costlier. In May, NewsBank quoted its prices: The full menu of the new Journal Sentinel archive options would cost almost $1.5 million, Kiely said, although there are more inexpensive options that provide less online material. The library would also be charged an annual 1 percent network-hosting fee, with that amount scheduled to rise after three years. That price, Kiely added, is “out of reach” for the library right now, although talks with NewsBank are continuing. Chuck Palsho, president of NewsBank’s media services, said a company representative will visit Milwaukee in September to discuss the newspaper archive and help brainstorm for ways MPL can secure the necessary funding. “This is a very high-demand product,” Palsho said. “The challenge is more in the fundraising.” Kiely said she has engaged in talks with some Wisconsin state officials about “broader strategies” to make such a purchase possible, although it’s too early to tell if the state may be willing to provide any type of grant. MPL already subscribes to some NewsBank content, including a database of Journal Sentinel material from 1990 to the present day, and America’s Obituaries & Death Notices, a popular genealogy resource. But the expanded newspaper archive would not be another subscription; MPL would own that content outright. Added Markwiese, “I think we’re living in a capitalist society. They (NewsBank) saw a need. They have a product. They charge what the market will bear.” Markwiese said MPL’s annual materials budget is about $1.8 million (which covers, among other things, database subscriptions), so spending almost $1.5 million of that on the NewsBank digital archive was not feasible. Palsho, for his part, said the archive is not intended for sale as a materials purchase. He said it’s intended as a capital expense to be covered through grants or other outside donations. Prior to the newspaper’s statement that the library would still receive free access, national media Slate’s Future Tense had picked up the story of the Google takedown and proposed NewsBank replacement. There was even a petition started at MoveOn to restore the Google archive.

I received email last wee from Stegman who apologized for delay and said it would be up shortly. I have my doubt. Anything you can add? Thanks Reply Bill McQuerry says: March 11, 2017 at 6:14 pm Mr Stegman told me several months ago that the archives would soon be up? I think he is stonewalling me. What exactly is the problem? Please tell me? Reply Bill McQuerry says: March 11, 2017 at 6:15 pm Is there a place where I can purchase access? Reply John Grube says: March 15, 2017 at 12:27 pm Bill, (and anyone else interested) I don’t believe the archive is ever coming back. I have tried buying a memebership at “GeneologyBank (another NewsBank business), but, even though they claim to have the entire archive, most searches bring up nothing, even items that I KNOW were there previously (with Google News). I suspect that in their greedy desire to make the information inaccessible, they have corrupted the databases connected with the archive. Jodi says: March 31, 2017 at 3:45 pm I was told by someone at the Journal that a new, better archive was going to be put online very soon. I was told that probably 6-12 months ago now. There is still no archive available anywhere. I asked them why they couldn’t have left the archives on Google until they got the new system up & running – no answer. I asked them if this was being done out of greed & now what once was free would now cost money – again, no answer. I emailed them for an update on the status & yes, once again, no answer. I told them that if this is how they conduct business, once my newspaper subscription came due, I would not be renewing it & I didn’t. I refuse to give my money to a company that only cares about $$$$$. The archives that Google created, was created from newspaper microfiche that is available for free at the local public libraries so it’s not like they were getting cheated out of anything. The Google service was such a HUGE resource for me as I was using it to help me with my genealogy. As someone who is disabled, it’s not always feasible to physically go to the library to look things up. These archives made it possible to access this information without having to go to the physical location. It also made the info available to everyone regardless of where you lived. If you don’t happen to live in Milwaukee county, you can’t access any of the online resources available through the Milwaukee Public Library website because you need to have a library card. In one of my my many emails to the Milw Journal, I advised them of those issues as well but they didn’t seem to care. In doing my research I’ve had to access several newspapers across the country & it seems the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel is the only one out there causing all these problems for customers who need access to their archives. Reply Elaine L says: April 1, 2017 at 4:43 pm I really miss the archives! I was born and raised in Milwaukee and read the Milwaukee Journal religiously! The archives provided a valuable research tool for me. It’s so sad that it went away!

Toshiba has reportedly completed the first round of bidding for its prized memory chip business, seen as key for the cash-strapped company to turn itself around. Some 10 foreign companies and funds, including Google and Amazon, tendered bids, the Yomiuri Shimbun said, quoting unnamed sources. The two United States tech giants are expected to use Toshiba's memory chips for their cloud services, the daily said. Taiwan's Hon Hai, which acquired Japanese electronics- maker Sharp last year, has apparently bid more than two trillion yen (S$25 billion), the daily said. Immediate confirmation of the report was not available. Toshiba shares jumped more than 5 per cent last Friday after local media reported that bidders included Apple, US private-equity firm Silver Lake Partners and American chipmaker Broadcom. Toshiba is expected to negotiate with individual candidates this month. Local media said any foreign buyer would need to pass a Japanese government review, given concerns about security around systems already using Toshiba's memory chips. Toshiba is the world's No. 2 supplier of memory chips for smartphones and computers, behind South Korea's Samsung, and the business accounted for about a quarter of its 5.67 trillion yen in revenue the last fiscal year. The news report came after angry investors lambasted Toshiba executives at a shareholders meeting over its warning that annual losses could balloon to more than US$9 billion (S$12.6 billion). The red ink is largely tied to huge cost overruns and construction delays at its US nuclear power unit Westinghouse Electric, which filed for bankruptcy protection late last month. Toshiba, which bought Westinghouse in 2006 for US$5.4 billion, now faces months of complex negotiations over the fate of its US nuclear business, a discussion that could embroil the US and Japanese governments. The American government has guaranteed loans of US$8.3 billion to help finance some of the construction of four reactors in the US. Putting US taxpayers on the hook for any losses related to Westinghouse's failure would be an embarrassment for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, particularly if the debacle sparks criticism from American President Donald Trump of Japanese corporations in the US.

Household names – including Volkswagen, Aviva and Heinz – have suspended or are reviewing their advertising with Google, which owns YouTube. This comes after learning that their brands have been promoted on YouTube videos posted by extremists showing scenes of terrorism. Claims: Big brands such as Coca-Cola and Heinz may take action against Google Now lawyer Sarah MacDonald, senior associate at leading media law specialists Wiggin LLP, has said advertisers could be entitled to compensation from Google or advertising agencies if their brands appeared on inappropriate websites. She said: ‘Advertisers could have a potential claim for contractual damages if their content appeared alongside inappropriate content.’ Around 250 companies are thought to have suspended advertising with the internet giant. They include L’Oreal, ITV, McDonald’s, Marks & Spencer, and Coca-Cola. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 2 Next ALEX BRUMMER: We shouldn't be surprised Sir Martin Sorrell...

Galaxy S8 and S8+ hands-on: Betting big on big David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/03/29 8:04am PDTMar 29, 2017 19 Plus 1 on G+ 79 Share on Facebook 58 Share on Twitter Total Shares156 Galaxy S8 News Phone Reviews Videos The Galaxy S6 was, by all accounts, a truly transformational moment for Samsung's industrial design. After years of building plastic phones constantly lambasted for their "cheapness," Samsung made radical changes in an attempt to completely redefine its smartphone brand. Those changes were generally well received, but it always felt like they stopped short: the software was still slow, bloated, and the battery life surprisingly poor. With the Note5 and S6 edge+ we saw significant refinement of that reinvention "moment," but not until the S7 and S7 edge did Samsung really build the concept I think they set out to with those first metal and glass sandwiches. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are Samsung's attempt to show us that they can do more than just iterate on that "Eureka" moment they had in 2015, even if those iterations have generally been quite good. And after the Note7 disaster last year, they really need to make good on that promise. After spending some time with the phones last week, I'm still on the fence as to whether Samsung has truly succeeded - but I think the pieces for success are there. Even if I don't think they're all terribly obvious, and even if the phones don't take any real big risks. The hardware Take what you loved about the Galaxy S7 edge and Note7, then just imagine it all being better. More refined, more coherent, more polished. As to that final point: literally. The Galaxy S8 siblings now feature polished aluminum mid-frames, as opposed to the matte anodized finish of years past. In particular - at least in my opinion - this looks good on the Midnight Black version of the phone, which features a shiny black mid-frame to match. The whole phone visually sort of looks like a deep black stone - it's a very interesting and striking effect Samsung has achieved here. As you'd expect of Samsung, the attention to detail is impeccable. The glass meets the aluminum in a very natural, near-seamless way, and the various body colors all have a distinct character. The front of the phones, however, do not: unlike years past, all colors of the Galaxy S8 and S8+ will feature black surrounds on the display side of the phone, to accentuate Samsung's "infinity display" and its minimal bezel. I absolutely agree with this design decision, because it brings the canvas - the screen - out as the sole focal point of the front of the device. You're drawn to the screen, and everything surrounding it just sort of falls away. Samsung has been paying attention to the little stuff, too. Everything from the design of the camera module (it now has more of a stylized "lens" effect) to the smooth USB-C cutout seems carefully considered and manufactured with precision. The phones scream quality, and I am continually impressed by Samsung's ability to iterate in this area. Samsung clearly spends a lot of time and energy on its design and manufacturing processes, and it shows. Perhaps most notably, these phones mark the end of one of the last vestigial elements of the Galaxy brand: capacitive navigation keys and the physical home button. It really makes the S8 and S8+ the cleanest-looking handsets Samsung's ever produced. Above the display sit the standard array of sensors, including a new 8MP front-facing camera with software-simulated autofocus (we'll see how that goes) and the iris scanner array. Out back, Samsung says the 12MP rear camera is basically unchanged physically from last year's, with most optimizations happening on the photo processing side. I'm certainly curious to see how photos compare to last year's phones, then. You still get IP68 waterproofing, and 64GB of storage is now standard (with microSD expansion available). Samsung has retained the headphone jack, but made the switch to USB-C it began with the Note7 last year. Wireless charging is intact, too. As to the deceptively giant displays, at 5.8 and 6.2", respectively, the phones are considerably taller this year. But they're also narrowed, meaning they're easier to get a grip on, and they really aren't especially heavy or unwieldy. Ceding so much of what was previously bezel space to the expanded display seems an obvious choice in retrospect, but to me it definitely necessitated the end of the capacitive keys, otherwise all that extra height tends to feel a bit wasted. Speaking of those keys. The software To answer your first and greatest question: Yes, you can switch the order of the navigation keys. You can either have them in Samsung (read: wrong) order, or change them to the standard Android layout of back, home, and recent apps (left to right). Samsung also lets you customize the color of the navigation bar background, which is nice. Sure, the iconography is nowhere near stock, but I couldn't really give a damn what the buttons look like as long as they do what I expect them to. And no, Bixby is not mapped to long-pressing the home key: that's 100% Google Assistant. (Bixby's functional overlap with Assistant is actually quite minimal - for now.) The latest version of I-Can't-Believe-It's-Not-TouchWiz is based on Android 7.0 (not 7.1, sigh) and feels basically similar to what we had on the Note7 and now have on the Galaxy S7 phones. "Grace UX" is the easiest on the eyes TouchWiz has ever been, and while there are still a bunch of old features in there I hardly think warrant the real estate in the settings app, Samsung continues to provide its own useful additions. I didn't spend much time with the software in-depth, as I really didn't have time. And Samsung's Bixby assistant was only demoed to us in a controlled, scripted test environment, which is useless from an evaluation perspective. I can give you the overview, though: it's basically Google Goggles meets Google Now meets voice-powered accessibility controls. It's definitely an interesting mesh of features, though Samsung's hardest push seems to be around the idea that people will want to use their voice to control things like their screen brightness, toggling the hotspot, picking a camera mode or filter, and generally controlling their device. I am, to put it bluntly, unconvinced anyone will use this. But maybe it'll win me over when our review units come in and I actually have a chance to put it to the test. But, if you were worried that Bixby was an attempt to subvert Google Assistant and replace it: please, don't be. Not yet, at least. Google Assistant and Bixby happily coexist on the Galaxy S8, and are frankly rather different products. Oh, and this is kind of interesting, I guess: Samsung has also implemented the fingerprint scanner gesture to bring down the notification bar. It's off by default, I think, but it's there. Like the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge after their respective Nougat updates, the S8 and S8+ don't actually display in their native, physical resolutions by default (they're set to full HD mode). I remain very divided on this choice: while I know the vast majority of people who own these phones will never, ever notice and reap considerable battery life returns as a result, why put in these more expensive ultra-high-res panels in the first place? Samsung's answer, of course, relies heavily on VR, because you need that Quad HD display mode to provide a good VR experience. But I don't think anyone, even Samsung, has actually produced compelling evidence that consumers care about VR (apart from the companies making VR products). I guess it comes down to the question of how much more a Quad HD panel of this type would cost to produce than a 1080p version. If it's not a big difference, then I guess I get where Samsung is coming from. One feature I found quite interesting is the new home button wake gesture. Simply press your finger on the home button that is shown in the always-on display mode for a moment, and the screen will wake, indicated by a light burst of haptic feedback. While obviously you won't get far if you have a fingerprint scanner lock set, you might be more likely to use Samsung's iris scan or face unlock features (the latter is new to the S8). Given rumors that Samsung intended to place the fingerprint scanner inside the display itself with the S8 but failed to achieve the necessary yields, I have to wonder if this is the compromise they've settled on: pushing customers away from the ubiquitous fingerprint scanner, for now, until their more impressive technology is ready for primetime. As for me, I probably wouldn't use the home button wake regardless - the fingerprint scanner is simply my preferred mode of authentication. The reader is definitely a bit of a reach on these phones, though, and even with my relatively long fingers I found the S8+ would definitely take some getting used to in terms of default hand positioning. Samsung's iris scanner tech is fast and very accurate, but I'm not always looking at my phone when I unlock it. Performance on the phones is not something I feel comfortable expressing any definitive opinion on at this time. They felt fine - not crazy fast, not particularly slow - but given the notoriety Samsung's phones have achieved for slowing down over time, my experience in a controlled demo environment is simply not going to be helpful in assessing these things. It's probably better for me to end that discussion here and save the extended thoughts for our review. I obviously can't judge battery life yet, but Samsung shared an interesting figure with me: the new batteries in the Galaxy S8 and S8+ feature much better cycle longevity than the ones in last year's phones. Whereas after a year of typical charge and discharge cycles last year's Galaxy S7 and S7 edge would see around 20% of their effective capacity lost, Samsung says that figure is more like 5% of capacity lost over a year on the S8 and S8+. That's definitely encouraging. Final thoughts The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are big, beautiful phones. The larger displays are absolutely great, and the switch to virtual navigation keys is long overdue. I'm sure they'll have great cameras, and I expect battery life will probably be largely comparable to last year's phones (i.e., good). TouchWiz is, as far as user experience goes, the best it's ever been. That may not be saying much for some of you, but I generally find Samsung's UI modifications at the very least aesthetically palatable nowadays, and some of the added features are genuinely useful. A switch to 64GB of storage as standard is absolutely welcome and, I think, should be the bar to meet for any flagship phone in 2017. Bixby, despite the fears of many (myself included), doesn't really seem meant to displace Google Assistant or search on your phone. The Snapdragon 835 version of the S8 and S8+ we'll get here in the US packs a lot of new and potent technology, too - it's not just faster than the 820 and 821, it's more efficient and more capable. What am I not loving yet? Launching with Android 7.0 feels oh so typical Samsung: they can preach all they want about how they test their software endlessly in order to ensure updates are smooth and low on bugs, but I just can't shake the feeling that Samsung really has no intention of changing its approach to Android platform updates. Performance is going to be a big question, too (and it's one Samsung seems uninterested in discussing). I won't even be able to conclusively come to an answer in our review, simply due to the amount of time we'll have to use the phones before publishing. That'll take weeks and months of additional testing. Finally, there's a lot of uncertainty remaining around the value proposition these phones will offer, and without pricing, that's hard to comment on just yet. There's also a lingering feeling that the S8 and S8+ feel iterative in terms of actual user experience versus being showcases for advancements in industrial design and engineering. Samsung itself seems very eager to present the reduced bezel and larger displays as the raison d'etre for the Galaxy S8. But it's hard to tell if beauty is more than skin deep with these phones. Why is the screen curved? Because it's pretty (fragile, and the edge UI experience sucks). Why is the aluminum frame now polished? Because it's pretty (and will get scratched). Why aren't the batteries any bigger? Because thin phones are pretty (even though everyone wants bigger batteries). These are thoughts that I've had a harder time shaking than I expected. There's no doubt the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are exceptional achievements from the standpoint of design and phone-building knowhow, but I think I can distill my feelings about them down to this: I'm really unsure why I'd want one of these that much more than a Galaxy S7 edge or, if it still existed, a Note7. If there's some major improvement to performance I missed, maybe that could be it, but on most other fronts - aside from the switch to virtual nav keys - I'm left scratching my head a bit. But, maybe that's just a result of not having enough time with them. Hopefully, we'll be reviewing these phones soon enough, as I'm eager to get a deeper sense of the changes Samsung's made and how they translate into a real-world product experience.

As for android 7.1 it really doesn't matter as samsung usually incorporates a lot of the new features long before they are available on newer android versions. Eagerly looking forward to the Note 8 though (4K screen for VR is going to be a much needed upgrade). Taylor Vaughn I freelance online, performing basic jobs which simply requires from you a laptop or computer as well as internet accessibility and it is a life-saver for me personally... After 6 months on this job opportunity and i gained so far total of 36,000 dollars... Basicly i make about eighty bucks/h and work for 3 to 4 hour most of the days.And marvelous thing about this job is that you can easily manage time while you work and for how long as you like and you get paid weekly >> http://v15.uk/xbRHM MJ I agree 4K is much needed for VR but I would question 4K or VR on a phone. LOL Toss3 Why? Works much better on phones as they aren't tethered to anything. Personally only use it for watching movies on planes or in bed when the gf is sleeping. MJ That is your only use cases? It's more useless than I thought. I watch movies on my big screen TV on my sweet couch when the GF is sleeping. No heavy BDSM head gear needed. Toss3 Pretty much. Never liked watching movies on a TV as TVs are always really small (unless you buy one of those 40k ones that are 100"<). I had a projector (with a 120" screen), but I sold it when I moved to another country, and because I don't watch TV that often a "big-screen" TV just doesn't feel that useful. I also like being thoroughly engrossed in the movies I watch without any distractions and only the Gear VR has offered me anything like that thus far. It's also the first private movie-theater that you can take with you wherever you go. The low resolution is the only thing that could be improved (and the straps of course). MJ Sure if it works for you but I don't like things strapped to my head and face. It must be a pain to unstrap when need a drink, snack, or take a piss. Toss3 You either lift the device (similar to ski goggles or snorkel) or you use the built-in pass-through mode. And there's really no need to unstrap anything when going for a piss. MJ I didn't mean literally unstrap but none of that sounds convenient or practical at all. LOL It must be me... MJ Samsung has made a product I would almost consider buying by cleaning up the UX, going with on-screen buttons, better aspect ratio, and minimizing the edge gimmick (next just get rid of it) while keeping the headphone jack and wireless charging BUT... The placement of the fingerprint is just horrible. David, you went on how Samsung pays attention to the details but they just randomly place the fingerprint reader? OK... They still make me wary of getting timely OS updates. Android 7.0? Really? I like to see if they follow up on their promise of monthly security updates on their unlocked phones. Cristian-Teodor TATOIU My S7 Edge, unlocked, Romania, received Nougat but still on freaking January security update! How bout dat? MJ That sucks but didn't they just make that promise a couple of weeks ago? Cristian-Teodor TATOIU They made that promise months ago but with the new top dog in tow... They'll make good on S8, no doubt, for the first 6-7 months. Then, they'll have the S9 to keep them busy. And so on, and so on... Really, really, really want/need timely security updates? Pixel or whatever Google brings out is the way to go. Not freaking out cause of some security vulnerabilities going unpatched for months? Samsung is an option then... They'll update, sooner or... Jordan L my friend, who is kind of paranoid about security, loves the Galaxy series of phones(probably because they look great). From a data security prospective; do you think Pixel or Galaxy is "more secure". He's worried less about hacks on old versions of the OS, he's worried about his cloud data. I vote for Pixel because you are only logging in with your Google account, and not also logging into your phone with a "Samsung" account. to use features. yes, Google tracks everything you do, but they are a US based company. Samsung is not, ... just a thought. I would THINK he would HATE the fact that he logs into his phone with Samsung account too. (you do have to use a Samsung account to fully use a Galaxy phone, right?) Justin You don't have to log in to Samsung's account to use the phone, but you lose out on things like Samsung Pay if you don't. EcE You don't need a Samsung account unless you want Samsung Pay, themes ( and their crapstore) or VR. Even then, they are two different accounts and AFAIK you don't need to share any private information to the Samsung account unless you use Samsung Pay. Vivek Rameses A non us company is much safer and private. Muh americans love garbage made in the US. dabug91 The Pixel would be the superior choice, as they will get monthly security updates through October 2019 at least. Max Johnson Battery size is concerning, but maybe that's something to do with precaution with the fire issue. Lawrence Fail!: It is way too tall, fingerprint sensor on the back, small battery, new bixie assistant with dedicated button, same old camera. Win. 64gb storage, looks cool. Biga173rd So what's a win in your book that can compare to this new phone? Zsolt V The same phone with a fruity fruit logo Biga173rd Ehhhh lno lol Lawrence Thanks for asking : the S7 and S7 edge... Better battery/size ratio same camera, same ram. Front fingerprint, and they can be hold by humans. Biga173rd Good point I personally will wait for the Note 8. Toss3 Agreed on the fingerprint sensor, but it does have face-unlock which should be a useful alternative (it is on Win 10 devices). I seriously don't understand why these companies are forcing AI assistans on us? Do people really use them? AI is useful, but not for phones. Camera is already good enough; use pro mode and it's amazing. Really can't expect better in a phone right now unless you start increasing the sensor size. EcE " this looks good on the Midnight Black version of the phone, which features a shiny black mid-frame to match" Glad to see the black phone is black on the sides, that chrome version looks horrible. Marcel Mayer hä? the device will show on 5pm? why you publish the article? PhillipeFelut so, whats the actual resolution of the display itself? DeathWolfGaming They are set to 1080p to save battery life. PhillipeFelut 2960x1440 is the number i was looking for. Jesse Lee Samsung is really receptive to their markets; a completely opposite direction from years past and from that being employed by Google Inc. The results are phones that continue to get better and better and more practical. Looks great! Timbets Linux 4.4 kernel Ishimaru I'm surprised. Even Google is still on 3.x. ProductFRED I'm not jumping to sell my S7 Edge Exynos just yet. Gotmilo waiting for the note 8 JD It's a damn solid phone. I wouldn't jump unless I pooped money and was having a bad case of the runs. Winston I'm upgrading from my flat S7 to the small S8. Why? Battery has deteriorated, and Samsung usually does really lucrative trade in deals with older phones, of which I still have an S4. John New smartphone releases are beginning to be as exciting as new dishwasher releases. That's a good thing as it means we can hold on to our phones for longer, smaller manufacturers can catch up to the big boys, and there will be more price competition rather than feature competition. Samsung seems to realize this which is why they're making a big push to differentiate on software. We would benefit from more alternatives to Google's software. I'm just skeptical that Samsung is capable. BC Um, why no images of the Dialer App's interface? It's something that I always want to know but never can readily find. David Ruddock Because I had an hour with the phones total and that wasn't really on my priority list. Sorry. BC It's cool, I'm just a weirdo that likes to know what all the interfaces I'll be interacting with regularly look within OEM apps. Cakefish Just look up the S7 Nougat update UI. I am pretty sure it'll be very similar to that, the rest of the S8's UI is. BC Not good enough for me, though I'll likely preorder the device...I'll be able to see it firsthand this way. Cakefish Check out the bajillion youtube hands-on videos, I'm sure one of them has what you're looking for :) BC I can only hope, though I have a feeling nobody will even care about the Dialer App. Cakefish Found one for ya! Look at 2:12 in the video: https://youtu.be/sZvp4L52QzQ BC Thank you! I had begun the scanning of videos to catch a hint of that app interface. Phone_Addiction Time to ditch my ip7 plus for the gs8+ brararsh Thinking of same. Adil Tajgeer i'm in the same boat but with the regular S8, it seems to be a great blend of big screen in a small package. but will just keep my iphone around. I NEED ALL THE SHINY THINGS. Biga173rd Wow!! that is one gorgeous phone. The build quality is incredible damn Sammy knocked it out of the park. And that metal frame... Nuno G. "You can either have them in Samsung (read: wrong)" Although it's not the standard order for Android, for me it's the natural order, specially for right handed persons!!! When I hold the phone, I hold normally with my right hand, so my thumb finger is the finger that is most near the screen on the right side of it. so it's normal for me to have the back button cause that's the one that I use more.. Miku is Best Vocaloid "Right handed persons" all have different preferences, I am right handed and I use the back button on the left. Middlefinger Im a lefty and Samsungs is still the better positioning. Google just have it wrong but the fanbois on here would never disagree with their Google god. JD Gotta say it wasn't until the S7e that I started to look at Samsung and that Samsung actually got me excited about Android Hardware again. I used to be a Nexus Diehard and when Google and other OEMs just all made glass rectangles, some with really bad software decisions I just gave up. But the S7e was something interesting. The S8 is a really lovely piece of Industrial engineering, like what the OG iPhone and iPhone 4 did to the industry when everyone was doing more of the same. jonzey231 I love that they continue to include wireless charging. iKon It's not even wireless... False advertising more like. jonzey231 Kay. Sharky I've been on Nexus for 5 years but I'm going to give this a go. The bezel-less screen makes it look like something genuinely new, I really wish the Pixel had looked this. I'm still skeptical about Samsung's UI skin but the move to virtual (& customizable!) buttons alleviates that a bit. Hopefully this will encourage Google to step up their efforts with the next Pixel, but it's going to take a big jump from last year's model to get me back. Jay The skin has not been a concern since s7. The whole look can be altered with one click via the theme store. I use one that makes it either look like native android or a jet black theme, that's so enjoyable on these amoled screens. Daniel Tiberius I'm looking forward to playing around with those themes. Middlefinger *S6. Sharky Admittedly the skin does looks quite nice now, I certainly hope I'm converted now I've shelled out $850 on this thing. Kevin Chaos I'm using the S7 and I really want the S8... but I'm going to force myself to wait and at least see what Apple has to offer with their next iPhone. That or Google needs to fix the Android messaging clusterfuck they've created. I've been using Android phones since the Nexus One but iPhones have come a long way and iMessage is starting to look really good. Toss3 Not sure why anyone with an S7/S7E would feel the urge to upgrade. Why not use something like Telegram, Whatsapp, etc. instead of SMS? Kevin Chaos I have a problem with wanting new toys constantly, haha. I think I've gotten a new phone every 6 months. Almost everyone I know uses SMS here. I am also using Google Voice myself. I just don't have enough friends who use those apps. At least that's my case in the United States. Toss3 I used to be like that, but now that Android has matured and caught up with the iPhone in terms of smoothness, I really don't feel the urge to upgrade as often as I used to. Only thing I want right now is an HDR 4K screen for the Note 8 and I'll be happy. Adil Tajgeer iMessage has kept my pixel and OP3 in a drawer for most of their time with me. but the S8 is so pretty i will probably bite the bullet and face the shame of the green bubble. fijisiv Why is the screen curved? Because it's pretty... Why is the aluminum frame now polished? Because it's pretty... Why aren't the batteries any bigger? Because thin phones are pretty... While most AP readers probably do a LOT of research before buying a phone, I'd wager a huge majority of phone purchases are done by people who walk into the store and say "oh that one looks pretty." Toss3 Thankfully we still have the Note-series that should cater to a different audience (hopefully). Adnoxaei It's beautiful, but I'll be skipping it it :/ The fingerprint scanned is just in a terrible spot for my normal usage. I hope one of those scanner techs that can go through the screen can get implimented in the next couple generations. Winston It was reportedly very close to being in the S8, but they couldn't quite get something good enough for it to be signed off. So, Note 8? Adnoxaei The note line got the iris scanner, so it is possible. I already think the S8 is a bit big (really, just too tall), so maybe it can be in the S9 and I'll get it then. At least my bank account will be happuer this year haha. Rann Xeroxx Once you use a scanner on the back of the phone, it actually turns out to be better as that is where your fingers typically are when holding the device. The only problem I can see is if you have it on a table or something and want to use the scanner. (I never do this as I rarely will leave my phone on a table). Miguel Fernandes How can it be better with that limitation? Jan Ibrahim Because in most circumstances for a lot of people , you unlock as you remove from your pocket. This is a lot easier with it on the back. Furthermore, it also means you can achieve a nice clean look on the front of the phone. But no solution is perfect, because the downside is desk use. But i find on the odd occasion I'm using my phone on my desk then pattern lock is fine. But I'd rather have on the back with that limitation than the other way around. Look how ugly the fingerprint scanners look on the front of some of the HTC and oneplus phones for example. John My problem with the S8 is not that the scanner is on the back, which is fine, but that it's all the way up next to the camera. Below the camera would have made more sense. iKon It's only good on the back, if it's in the middle like Huawei devices. Samsung has the worst position out of everyone. My name is…. Google needs to take lessons on how to make pretty phones. Who's gonna prefer a pixel to this? Crazy fanboys only. saf1927 People who actually want a phone. No flat display, no good. My name is…. Pixel was a joke of a phone, i cant believe that Google gave that thing iphone price, so ridiculous. Im sure S8 will be better in every aspect. asian_slaw if you are solely hating on the phone because of the price, you definitely dont understand or have experienced the pixel to it's full potential My name is…. I had a pixel on my hands. i also was an owner of all Nexus phones (after Nexus 4) I would never buy a pixel. There are better phones out there that are better. saf1927 Yes, after coming out half a year later, it doesn't take that much to get a better phone out. By the way, the iPhone 7 will still outperform the S8. it’s me tim-cock. Dude calm your tits. This phone puts the garbage looking iphone and pixel to shame. Your move crapple. saf1927 Come again when Samsung actually puts out a phone that is better than an iPhone in all aspects. A high-res display is nothing to flash your ass out for. Lars Jeppesen Yeah, much better display, more ram, better waterproofness, more freedom (default app anyone? ), wireless charging, fast charging, iris scanner, much higher screen-to-phone ratio, SD card support, bluetooth 5, wifi direct, VR, better assistant (Google Assistant/Bixby),, OH YEAH_, the iPhone sure is better... /s saf1927 >much better display Doesn't make a difference since the iPhone has one of the best and most accurate displays in the market. > more ram Well, with the bloat you get from it, I think it's a plus that it has the RAM to cope with it. >better waterproofness Not a deal-breaker >more freedom Nothing to do with Samsung, it's general Android feature. > fast charging / wireless charging I'll give you the first, the second is a gimmick and not really "wireless". >iris scanner A gimmick you can live without > SD card support Not needed since you can't install apps on it. > bluetooth 5 Nice, but the phone is coming out in 2017, least they could do. > better assistant Google Assistant, yes. Bixby is yet to prove itself. Now, when Samsung and Qualcomm can match the A10 performance, let's talk. Rann Xeroxx Why on Earth would you pay the absurd price for the Pixel compared to a phone like this? Heck, the Pixel is ugly to boot. And purely from an enterprise standpoint, it has real problems with MDM and ActiveSync configurations to where Samsung goes out of their way to make sure it works perfectly on corporate solutions. saf1927 I actually have an iPhone 7 too, which of course is better than anything Samsung puts out. Looks are subjective. I hate edge displays, so this phone is as ugly as it gets. someone755 Agreed, keep it flat so I can put a normal screen protector on it. JohnyNoLegs Can't even do that on the pixel. These days are over someone755 Then I simply won't buy a phone like that, and I advise anyone that sympathizes with my hate of curved screens to do the same. Vote with your wallet. New_Guy Somebody just dropped some world-class knowledge. Kudos Felix ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "the Pixel is ugly" - ever heard looks are subjective? I really like the design of the Google Pixel. More than the edge display on the Galaxy phones. h4rr4r Good you can fix the keys! Can you change the settings menu to be normal? Winston Nope, from my time with the S7. And I imagine that will soon be the new normal. Android O DP already has a similar design. So it will soon become normal. h4rr4r Please google, stop moving shit around for the sake of moving shit around. Winston You are the one moving shit around. I don't know what the hell the incentive is for lying, but I have a Galaxy S7. I have a Fast Charger. I have tried both turning the fast charger off in software, AND using a different cable. They both kept my phone cool while charging when using it, and with fast charging on it would heat up. h4rr4r I did not decide to move the buttons around at random or change the settings to some touchwiz crap. I have no idea what you are talking about with the charger. I said nothing about fast chargers. Of course fast chargers make the phone hotter. How do you think this all works? Winston It's not "considerable battery gains". They're actually fairly small: within 10-15 mins SOT in my experience. Samsung itself said, moving from the 5.7 1080p of the Note 3 to the 1440p of the 4, that the power usage delta was 3.5%. That's in hardware. Imagine how little the change is in software. lsh99 The build and design of this phone is exactly what I've been waiting for: premium finishes with a huge screen-to-body ratio. That said, I'm waiting for the Note 8. Cristian-Teodor TATOIU Pricing, for Europe - 799EUR for S8, 899EUR for S8+. These should translate 1:1 to USD + taxes, for US. Of course, unlocked. Turb0wned The question is, if I ordered the US unlocked version from Best Buy, will Samsung screw me out of updates like they did with the unlocked S7E? Trysta After a major Samsung phone reveal, I usually spend the first couple days trying to rationalize how I could buy it even though touchwiz scares me, because the hardware is just so lust-worthy. But this time...not so much. It looks very fancy obviously, and I love the increased screen to body ratio (hopefully all other OEMs....*cough* Google *cough* are paying attention!). But I thought the Note 7, with the extra subtle curves was really the maximum amount of screen curve I was willing to deal with. The curve of the S8/S8+ seems to be going back towards obnoxious taking over 20% of the screen with glare again. Wish they had kept the curved edges the way they were on the Note 7. Batteries are too small, although I understand why they wanted to be careful this year. After my Nexus 6p disappointment, battery life is basically my number one feature for my next phone. And the fingerprint sensor placement is just awful, for seemingly no other reason than to be different from everyone else who has a back fingerprint sensor. I don't want to use iris scanning or face detection. Fingerprint sensors work really well for turning on my phone quickly. This is a major feature of all current flagships. Why did they think this was something that was ok to experiment with/mess up? But in the end, just like every year, I was never going to buy this phone anyway. I hope that it is a great phone for Samsung fans (I'm sure it will be). Shame-sung C.E.O Absolutely horrible looking phone.that it lacks innovation and nothing but gimmicky features. Dominic D ok it’s me tim-cock. As if anyone expect anything diffraction from you. Shame-sung C.E.O Why would anyone expect anything positive from a CORRUPT, thief company? Middlefinger Doesnt do thieving Apple or LG much harm though, or HTC with their new iPhone rip-offs. Shame-sung C.E.O You are mistaken the Corrupt Swinesung Machine that has been sued by. Apple,Dyson,BlackBerry,Microsoft,LG,TSMC And countless other manufactures for stealing. Hmm you sound like those Swinesung guys that were getting paid to Shill and got caught. You can only wish that Apple and LG and anyone else was as horrible as corrupt company as Swinesung. But unlike you i stand by Facts, go ahead and get upset. Not going to change history. : ) Middlefinger Selectively sued in countries with crap IP laws where you can patent anything vague and sue for it even if you never actually made the thing yourself. They failed to sue in countries with reasonable laws. Samsung also counter sued and won, so whatever... Shame-sung C.E.O That's a beautiful excuse. But not a good one. Funny how Swinesung has lost multiple times and agrees to settle after it has uses stolen designs and software and technology. Swingeing has lost all across the world from its home country to the the US. This is the problem with the fanboy mentality. They make poor excuses but everything is online. Swinesung has convicted 2 times of corruption in south korea alone. From Racketeering, Tax Evasion. Fraud and Embezzlement and countless other charges. Also they have the highest return in TV's in the industry with defects. Heck in the S7 and S6,5,4 have all suffered from low quality screens and having image retention issues (again all the information is online if you search) to burn in issues and lets not forget the exploding issues because they choose quantity over quality. Shamesung will always be just that. A low quality company who cares about numbers then quality. Middlefinger You're just a troll, yuor username proves that all by itself. Most of the thing Samsung have been sued for related directly to Android itself, so is Googles fault if anything, not anything they have done. You know this but just troll this site because you are a child with nothing better to do. Dont bother replying, your blocked as of now. Shame-sung C.E.O AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH Facts hurt and hurt so dam much . Man how pathetic. Jay Not sure how your kind of comments continue to survive on this site. Shame-sung C.E.O Because people are entitled to facts and opinions. Just because Swinesung is a horrible corrupt company does not mean bling ignorance does not exist. I mean i like Android and think its amazing and useful, And i feel the same way about Apple , Microsoft LG ect. But Swinesung... Naw i draw the line on the most corrupt company in the tech industry by Parsec's. Dominic D I just wish Samsung would update all their devices at the same time like Apple. Okay, maybe not all... but definitely their S series of devices. It's holding me back from purchasing a Samsung phone again. My AT&T S6 Edge was beautiful but didn't receive Marshmallow for a year. It was nearly unusable on Lollipop with barely an hour and a half of screen-on time. I love my 6P and I'm soon looking to upgrade, but I'm nervous about purchasing another Samsung device. Berkay Wait for the pixel 2 Ilya Kushnir Linux Kernel 4.4.16. This happened! Maha Rashtrian TAKE MY MONEY NOW! How much does it cost though? Mix If Samsung made a phone with stock Android, that had Google's updates I would be in love. My Pixel is nice but Samsung phones just feel nicer. JSo Remember Google Play Edition devices? Those were the days. Mix I do not! My first was Android was a Nexus 4 and I came from a BB Bold! Nexus 4, Nexus 5, Galaxy S6, Pixel Xl, Pixel Xl, Pixel Xl....(I am on my third Pixel, lol) JSo Well other OEMs used to make versions of there devices with stock android on it and they were sold in the Play Store. The Galaxy S4 was one of them. Jaime May I ask why? Were your phones faulty? Mix Mic died on the 1st Pixel and the 2nd one bricked and both were RMA'd through the play store for brand new devices. someone755 "The Pixel is totally worth it, it's a great investment." You alone are proof of the contrary. Mix Just pop on over to GooglePixel on Reddit. Some people are on their 5th phone...when it works it works but my experience? This is the worst Android phone I have ever owned! My 3rd one has been great though so fingers crossed I am done RMA'ing it. someone755 Exactly. There are so many apologists out there of this phone that keep saying that the phone is worth its price, that other phones are just as flawed etc. Meanwhile there are hundreds if not thousands of customers like you. VAVAMk_2 Why? Mix Mic died on the 1st Pixel and the 2nd one bricked and both were RMA'd through the play store for brand new devices. Support has been great but my phone experience has been terrible. 2kool4skool Agreed, google gets their software right but their hardware could use a lot of improvement. JohnyNoLegs Yea like messenger, allo, duo, hangouts. And pixel now has apps you can't uninstall. Google will be the next Samsung! 2kool4skool Well, should I say partly right, then? JohnyNoLegs Let's just say Samsung does it better than google recently, and that's saying something. Btw I'm on pixel xl coming from note 7. iKon Any phone looks better than the Pixels because #Bezels Bojan Radovanović well, that is true, but it's not a picture to stand in front of it and admire how it looks... Ra1nb0wD4sh DE On my pictures the bezels (aka frames) are mostly wanted though... Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ If Samsung made the phone with stock Android, nobody except a bunch of geeks would buy it. Consumers want the features Samsung adds to Android. Mix Would the average user and purchaser of Samsung phones even know they had stock Android device? Probably not. Samsung makes mach better hardware but their updates and support after the sale freaking suck. Took something like 8 months for my SG6 phone to get an update since Google gives it to Samsung to add shit, then Telus gets to add shit, then I get it. That type of update system is pure trash. theProffer It's the same group of people that can't tell the difference between the new iPhones. You know, the ones Jimmy Kimmel makes fun of once a year. Middlefinger Samsung have to fix Googles mess first, because lets face it, Stock android is a buggy unreliable mess. You cant blame the OEMs for wanting to wait until the software is viable before they risk putting it on their customers devices. Google doesn't care, that's why the Nexus didnt sell well, and the pixel has needed fix after fix after fix. whispy_snippet No. Middlefinger Yes, but Google shills dont like to hear it. whispy_snippet Still no! Middlefinger Denial is pretty powerful. Jay Nothing in the pixel has been so broken, that's its stopped from being a consistent daily driver with over 6.5 hours SOT and over a day of standby. Issues have been present yes, but so have been with any phone. My iPhone 7+ ended up getting replaced twice... once because the damn camera unit entirely died 2 days later and secondly when the screen stopped responding. Then iOS 10.2 decided to suffer from Wi-Fi issues and all sorts of weird documented bugs. Nothing is ever 'PERFECT' However since that does not fit your narrative, it's not a thing. Middlefinger Most pixe issues are software/driver related, and thats always been the way with Google devices, although the Nexus range also had terrible build quality as well. At least the Pixel is better on that front. The problem is stock android, which is why the OEMs need to modify it to be production worthy. Im sure you will make excuses, but thats the reality. LineOS for exynos! What Better quality? The besel king! This and the iPhone Middlefinger Like it or not the Pixel is a step up over the likes of the N5, which was terrible. There was a reason the older Nexus devices were cheap, and it had nothing to do with Google 'subsidising' them. LineOS for exynos! Compared to Nexus the pixel are good but is nothing compar to Galaxy or even Huawei. The Nexus is meant to race with the iPhone.. in the meantime they​ only race to the biggest bezels Middlefinger I agree, but what i mean is purely construction quality. The Nexus was cheaply made, and it showed, especially the 4 and 5 and the tablets. The Samsungs pre-S6 were a bit cheap feeling, but at least they were made with good components and were reliable, the Nexus' were neither. whispy_snippet Well, no. Every average Joe consumer would buy it PLUS a heap of stock Android nerds. Average consumers don't have a freakin clue what TouchWiz or stock Android even are. Who gives a shit anyway. It's never going to happen. trapchan Nah, stock Android can't even block sms spam by phrase, and it took them how many years just to implement call blocking? I had it since iPhone 5. Middlefinger Oh god no. Bargain basement software that isnt reliable isnt what people want. Im sure even a stock S8 would have less issues than the trouble prone Nexus and Pixel phones, but even so, it would be commercial suicide for Samsung to rely on an unfiltered Google experience. someone755 It would net them a few thousand customers though. I know I'd be switching to a Samsung if they only made some AOSP-style software possible. Middlefinger Apple could probably sell more iPhones if they had an Android version, but it still doesnt mean it will happen. It would cheapen the Samsung brand to launch an AOSP version, and the only people that would care could just run a custom ROM anyway. someone755 Agreed on all but that last part -- That's why I'm not already a Samsung customer, as they make great efforts to prevent people from running custom ROMs. Middlefinger and yet suck ROM exist, so.. xyz It was called a Galaxy Nexus. JohnyNoLegs I prefer Samsung software. My pixel xl is barron, has nothing in comparison. Can't wait to sell and get the s8 gacl The Pure Google experience of Nexus + Pixel is nice, but Samsung hardware is nicer. A Google Play Edition Samsung would be better, but it's not that big a deal. TouchWiz is nice too. Cakefish The fact that I'm currently unemplyed will prevent me from giving in to my uncontrollable urges to always have the latest tech. S8 looks great. Switchable nav keys, 10nm processors, batteries that lose significantly less of their capacity over time. narrower dimensions for one-handed use, 64GB storage, and a Samsung equivalent to Google's HDR+ camera processing are my personal highlights. Cakefish P.S. for UK users you can get it on the 19th April if you preorder (8 days early). Also, UK pricing: S8 = £689.00, S8+ = £779.00 Middlefinger Yeah but will be cheap enough on contract which is how most people buy phones. Cakefish But I prefer to buy unlocked :( Lars Jeppesen Blame Brexit for that.. the phones are the same prices as the S7 for me here in Denmark Cakefish I do blame Brexit :( ddevito Nice phone, but no thanks. Perfectly comfy with my OP3. Then again I've never owned a Samsuck and never will james fuston jeeeesus the price point. S8 is anywhere from 720-750 and the S8+ is 850? We are getting dangerously close to breaking the 1K mark with standard configurations for phones. I can't justify paying twice the street price of an S7/S7E for one of these. This will be a hard pass for me. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The LG G6 is $750 and the Pixel XL is $869, and those two phones look pitiful compared to the S8 and S8 Plus. What are you complaining about? Cakefish 21% (S8 vs S7) and 22% (S8+ vs S7 edge) price rises for UK (thanks Brexit) hkklife Pixel XL is the biggest rip-off on the market that's not made by Apple. Google was redefining the $/performance ratio back in 2012 and 2013 with the Nexus 4/5 and Nexus 7s. And then they got greedy and cozied back up to the carriers and went sky-high with their pricing. I'd love to see the BoM for HTC and Google on the Pixels. Gotta give Samsung credit for not jettisoning important features while truly redefining what a rectangular slab handset should be. I still think that the S8 line is one step from greatness---an unlocked model updated in a timely fashion with a 6/128GB RAM/storage variant for all markets and a 500mAh battery boost would make it a world-beater. David Williams I agree. The price point should not be surprising to anyone. james fuston The Pixel XL is $779. Not sure where you're pulling that extra $100 from. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The 128 GB model is $869. There is no 64GB model. Regardless, the price differences aren't very big either way, and the Pixel XL doesn't hold a candle to the S8 Plus in terms of form OR function. james fuston Yeah, you're either entirely missing or intentionally glossing over the "standard configuration" part. Either way, I can tell you're all aboard the hype train for new technology by the amount of hyperbole you're spouting. Not sure why you felt like chiming in on my comment about the cost/value of the S8 vs the S7, but I think we're done here. Diego Kaku Why no one talks about the stupid position of the fingerprint scanner? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I hate the location of the fingerprint scanner on the S8/Plus. Absolutely despise it. But the rest of the phone is f'in amazing. And it's possible I'd end up using iris or facial recognition anyway. I'm not buying one, but that's only because I'm waiting for the Note 8. Fresh360 Well that was depressing, has all of those leaks left us jaded? What if there were no leaks and only whispers and then we saw a nearly bezel-less phone with a massive screen in a small body? I really think this preview would have had a very different tone. Suresh Aryal Nothing about speakers yet. GSMArena says it has stereo speakers. invinciblegod OH GOD MY OCD!! Those ports are not centered!!!!!!! Groud Frank Samsung Mobile is maturing as a tech company. It's no longer "Let's just copy Apple and cram features into our phones to compete with the iPhone." From Samsung Pass to Samsung Pay to Bixby to DeX, this is a beautiful phone with useful features. I can actually see this phone making my life easier, especially in the password management department. Less navigating, less touching, a focus on user experience and practicality - well done Samsung. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I think Samsung is going to break sales records with these phones. Max Gromada Well, they just "copied" those features: - google's HDR+, - the next iphone's screen proportions; - apple pay, - modern ai voice assistant (they've bought the company that had made the Siri), - apple's augmented reality tech - Nokia's / MS iris scanner. They're welcome to implement a feature-rich phone, but those innovations did not come from Samsung. Tech Writer -Combining multiple photos into one has been a thing much before google did it. Does anyone remember OPPO's 50MP super hi-def mode? Plus I'm sure the implementation is different than Pixel's HDR+. For example, this one works without HDR, and with HDR too. -Next iPhone's screen proportions? Dude, are you kidding me. Samsung is the one who is going to provide those screens to Apple. Plus, this phone is probably in development much before the iPhone. -Apple pay: No. Samsung pay uses MST, not NFC. It's a unique patented tech by looppay, which Samsung acquired. Apple can't even use it and hence Apple pay can't operate in legacy terminals. -modern ai voice assistant: Bixby is not a voice assistant. The phone has google assistant for that. Bixby is more of helper and tells you what is around you. It isn't meant to tell you a joke or search things, you have assistant for that. -apple's augmented reality tech: I really don't know what you are talking about. -Iris scanner: I'll give you that. Most of these are Samsung's own innovations, or acquisitions which are patented. Max Gromada Tech Writer, man, combining multiple photos into one has been a thing since the invention of photography ) It's just Google that made it ideal for the phones - combining multiple pics of several milliseconds of exposure into one is a brilliant idea, it greatly expands the dynamic range of small sensors, and i think every manufacturer should just copy that tecnique. Doesn't matter if they call it "hdr" or not. It improves dr, that's all we need. No, i'm not kidding - some time ago, Apple approached Koreans with the question if they could supply the screens of some specs - and voila - while Apple is still playing with the idea, figuring out if the screen should be curved or not, and how the f.. are they going to install the fingerprint scanner right into the screen... the Koreans just rolled out the phones of very similar screen proportions. I don't think this is just a coincidence. Call it a controversial bull..it ) The idea behind Apple pay was simply to pay by phone conveniently. Dunno, maybe Samsung's tech is better, but they were following Apple. I think augmented reality features are the next big thing for smartphones. Project Tango did not start well, but apple is working on it, samsung is working on it - NOT a coincidence. I don't argue with the point that Samsung is a great tech company. The point of my comment was that Samsung is still some way into "Let's copy Apple and cram features into our phones to compete with the iPhone." They definitely are set into direct competition with iphone, and at this moment, from my point of view, there are no features that apple would like to copy from samsung to compete with it. Groud Frank "The next iPhone". They copied features from a phone that doesn't even exist? Are you serious? Dude, stop making a fool of yourself😂 Middlefinger Quite a bit of salt in this article. Samsungs nav buttons are not in the 'wrong' order, Googles are. Argue all you like but the fact remains its subjective and not objective. Im glad Samsung doesnt use Googles staid UX. and you cant complain about Samsung not being as innovative in the software as they are in the hardware and simultaneously get snarky about them not using Googles way of doing things. Google hasnt innovated a damn thing since ICS so if they did make a stock S8 it would be worse, based on your own claim. dabug91 Actually, you're wrong. When you use just about any web browser on the planet, where is the back button located? Top Left. Same for when you use just about any file explorer: Top Left. Same for when you use iOS devices, where do they generally place the back button? Top Left. It makes perfect sense for the back button to be on the left side of the device, because that IS the ergonomically and aesthetically superior place for it. You're wrong, get over yourself. Middlefinger Use with a mouse is different than touch use, and 2 handed touch use is different than one. You are comparing completely different UI element, so your point is invalid. dabug91 Actually, people's thumbs can very easily reach the bottom left hand side of their device, so your distraction about UI's is invalid and you're still wrong. Kys. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I hold my phone in my left hand, and use it with my right hand. The position of the back button makes no difference to me, but I like it on the right. It's not an objective thing. Give up trying to make it so. Middlefinger Right is still better for the most often used function. Given the option most people I know have that set up. Google cant be trusted to know whats best in a UI. This is the company that gave us material design, an admittedly pretty interface that gives you hardly any information per page. Its cumbersome, and this is proven by the fact that they cant even keep it consistent in their own apps, because it just doesnt work properly. Max Gromada Regarding 2-handed touch use, find the "Esc" key on your keyboard ) But, imho, when you're doing it all with your thumb, it does not matter what side the "back" key is placed. I was comfortable with the both layouts. trapchan Do you even realize that Backspace key is always placed on the right side of the keyboard, and not on the left side? You point is invalid, get over it. AbbyZFresh I'm sure that this new phone will be a hot commodity likurges I was about to make a joke about the bezzels but there are none.. unlike on the pixel where I have parked my airplane, built a house and a f1 track with some space left. SAM While improvements are welcomed, battery and camera didn't get much attention this year. Lets hope after everything other is taken care of this year, battery and camera will be next. I have a feeling that with what google achieved in pixel's camera, next iPhone(maybe) and pixel 2 will blow the shit out of competition. Max Gromada Actually, the camera is improverd in S8: there is a multi-exposure mode, aka pixel's HDR+, a very welcome feature. SAM I really wish this is the case. They didn't talk much about camera in live stream. Ace Time to buy gs7 _jsw_ Is that the new Gear 360 I see in the background? It's in the image of the S8+ on the stand. Max Gromada Yes, they've introduced the new Gear 360 someone755 That's all great and all, but these prices are getting ridiculous. r0xp0x Too bad even the regular sized one is a tad bit too big for me, and I don't like having a fingerprint scanner on the back of the phone, but it sure is gorgeous. whispy_snippet The headline feature is a big, bezzeless display. Meh. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, never mind the 835, the two types of wireless charging, the Samsung Pay, the HDR screen, the... oh, never mind. You wouldn't care, anyway. whispy_snippet No. I don't. They're just iterations on stuff Samsung always offers. They bring very little to the table that wasn't already there. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Then buy a Pixel. You'll love its football field sized bezels, and the wonderful halos in its pictures. Yeah, I keep hearing that halos are rare. Another site just published a comparison of 22 pictures between the LG G6 and the Pixel. 4 of the 22 Pixel pictures had halos. None of the G6 pictures had halos. So it's not so rare, unless you think 18% of photos is rare. whispy_snippet I have a Pixel. I've experienced the halo effect maybe twice ever. I barely see it because you don't generally shoot straight into strong light sources because it results in crappy shots with any camera. The most important thing for me is user experience. What's the device like to use and own on a daily basis? The Pixel is exceptional in this metric. Great software, great ergonomics, great camera, regular updates, excellent performance. The S8 looks really beautiful, but I see UX compromises everywhere. The off centre, rear mounted fingerprint scanner next to the camera; the glass back; the curved edge display; two voice assistants (yes, they don't fully overlap but Samsung's end goal will be to bump Google Assistant). The S8 is just another new phone. Semianonymous Having voice control over the camera can actually be pretty useful. I have the speak to capture feature enabled on my S7 and it's enabled me to capture some tricky shots that might not have turned out as nicely if I had moved my hand to take the shot. If it's intelligent enough to do stuff like recognize the target and focus/zoom etc, then that could be potentially be really cool. Renan I'd wish Samsung would made a flat version of this... I find the Edge... edges useless. mchalakov Dear Samsung, Just because you think that a curved screen is really cool(it is but just for a presentation) doesn't mean that everybody will like it. Also who the fuck decided it's a good idea to put the fingerprint reader there? Best wishes and less explosions, Yours (some) part of the Internet PVL_93_RU To think that if Samsung didn't keep the archaic home and capacitive buttons for as long as they did - many more of their devices could look just as beautiful as S8 Teja The best thing I like about S8 is that they have made it without compromising on any of the features from their last generation despite having a big change in design. *cough* Headphone Jack *cough* Stadi I don't like the polished frame. Shiny metal has been out of fashion for some time. gacl I'm disappointed the S8 has no s-pen stylus support. It seems like Samsung deliberately withheld that to justify a separate Note8, but the Note line is basically the same as the Galaxy line. The S8+ is already a phablet. Just merge the two. Or at least let Galaxy users get s-pen support even if the device doesn't hold the pen internally. trapchan kinda underwhelming. no under screen fingerprint sensor, same kind of screen as LG G6, same camera as S7, and the "scream quality" thing is not even close to iPhone. Compare the charging port and speaker hole side by side, and you'll know which one "scream quality". Đức Thành It certainly looks nice, but I have a feeling it's still more gimmicky than functional. For example, most people would have this phone in a case, because if they don't, it's going to scratch very easily—so there's no real point to it looking that pretty. And those curved edges look great, but does it make it more useful or less? I'd say less, and a few drops will prove how this was not the best choice to make. I understand why Samsung decided to go with these, though, much in the same vein they go with the current approach to software: They need to sell products, and this is a marketing strategy that seems to be working quite well. That's not to say there isn't a better approach, though. This will take time, but eventually when people have wised up, the products themselves will also turn into more rational choices for consumers.

WHAT IS FAKE NEWS? Fake news is not new, and phony stories made up for political reasons have been around since the country was founded. What’s new about fake news is that in the age of social media it’s been easy to make, easy to spread and profitable. Two examples It doesn’t take long to create a fake news site. A report by the New York Times found that the site Christian Times was started with a $5 domain name purchase and a clever college graduate looking to pay off student loans. The site collected thousands of dollars in ad revenue in a few months from Google as its fabricated stories began to be widely shared. A story from a site called denverguardian.com had the headline “FBI agent suspected in Hillary email leaks found dead in apparent murder-suicide,” At one point the tale was being shared on Facebook at a rate of 100 shares per minute. When the Denver Post looked into the story, it found the “Denver Guardian” and the story were fabrications. Read it here Google announced it permanently banned nearly 200 publishers from its AdSense network in December. AdSense has about 2 million publishers. Five categories of fake news A paper written by Information and Media Studies professor Victoria Rubin of the The University of Western Ontario developed five categories of fake news to help readers understand what they encounter. 1. Intentionally deceptive 2. Jokes taken at face value Satirical sites such as the Onion, Weekly World News, Daily Mash. 3. Large-scale hoaxes Deceptions that are reported in good faith by reputable news sources. 4. Slanted reporting of real facts Most often public relations-driven stories put together to serve an agenda. 5. Stories where the ‘truth’ is contentious Certain stories where there is no established baseline for truth. THE SPIKE IN FAKE NEWS The chart below shows the search interest on Google for fake news. There was relatively no interest until a month before the election. The scale shows the highest peak interest over time. Since the election President Trump has continued to use the term “fake news” in his Twitter feed regularly. President Trump’s claims are mostly critical of reports he perceives as biased reporting. KNOWING WHAT IS REAL According to a Pew Research Center survey conducted after the election, the majority of Americans are at least somewhat confident they can recognize fake news when they see it. Mass confusion The majority of Americans say completely made up news has caused a great deal of confusion about the basic facts of current events. DOES IT HAVE AN IMPACT After the term fake news became regularly used by both Democrats and Republicans in the 2016 election, economists Matthew Gentzkow of Stanford and Hunt Allcott of New York University conducted a study of the role fake news played in the election, particularly in social media. You can see the report here Here’s a look at some of the findings: Trump stories got attention The study calculated that fabricated stories favoring Donald Trump were shared more than 30 million times, and fabricated stories favoring Hillary Clinton were shared about 8 million times within 30 days of the election. Falling for it Percentage of population that believed election headlines were true. The first headline is true, the rest are fake. Did it matter? The study calculated the impact of social media versus TV and how many people believed and remembered the fake stories. The results said each fake story share would have needed the same persuasive effect as 36 television campaign ads to have changed the outcome of the election. In short, fake news had an impact but was not extremely influential. FOOL PROOFING The International Federation of Libraries has an eight step guide to help spot fake news.

Anorak Anorak | Google tax is not cheating tax on revenue Menu Home News Politics Madeleine McCann Strange But True Celebs Film Music TV & Radio Fashion Tech Cars Money The Consumer Sport Flashback Photos About Home News Politics Madeleine McCann Strange But True Entertainment Celebs Film Music TV & Radio Life Fashion Tech Cars Money The Consumer Sport Flashback Photos About Google tax is not cheating tax on revenue by Paul Sorene | 1st, April 2017 Most of us view the web via Google. The company makes huge amounts of money for showing adverts to internet users. But should it pay more tax? The Daily Mail says Google paid “just” £36.4million in UK corporation tax last year. This sounds like a lot of money. But the Mail’s says it’s not a lot when you see the figure in light of Google’s “£1billion in revenues” – i.e. turnover. A politician is outraged. Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Susan Kramer thunders: “It is appalling that Google are still getting away with paying such a paltry amount of their total revenue back in taxes.” Er, no. Revenues are not the same thing as profits. You’d think a leading politician would now that. The Government describes Corporation Tax as a 20% on profit. Google made a pre-tax profit of £149m in the UK for the 12 months to the end of June 2016. But accounts filed by Alphabet, Google’s parent company, show UK sales of almost £7bn. But Google’s UK sales are booked in the Irish Republic, where corporation tax is 12.5%. Ireland boasts of its favourable rates. The Republic of Ireland’s IDA seeks to secure inward investment. It produces this handy guide to its corporate tax rates:     Such are the facts.   Paul Sorene Posted: 1st, April 2017 | In: Money, News, Politicians Comment | Follow the Comments on our RSS feed: RSS 2.0 | TrackBack | Permalink Contact Us Writers Like Us Follow @TheAnorak Share this article Comments GALLERIES FEATURED STORIES 8 Reasons Children of the 1970s Should All Be Dead Was the Yugo the worst car ever made?

There are two ways you can use the Reserve tool: Either by visiting its site, or by searching for a specific studio on Google, and then booking your next class within the search result. The site can also provide you with recommendations for other types of classes you may be interested in, and won't take away any of the introductory offers or other benefits you may receive from signing up through the usual route.

This week, Facebook announced its own fundraising feature, which will allow users to set up donations campaigns right on their page, instead of going to platforms like GoFundMe. Who knows what's next for these tech titans? Until we find out, start booking those classes now. (And here are four more helpful Google features you may not know about.)

Most companies took to their social media accounts to deliver their pranks, posting short videos and pictures to try and convince the most gullible of their plans. WestJet rebrands to become “most Canadian” airline The WestJet Twitter page was completely rebranded as “Canada Air” on March 31st as the airline got a head start on their nationwide prank. The airline carried the ruse through a commercial-like video to promote the rebranded airline and kept the joke up until the very end when the company promised to continue being WestJet.

The streaming giant seemed to be following in the footsteps of the “live” trend.

The dogs would be in charge of giving special handshakes to premium fliers and also helping people pass the time on long-haul flights.

[Continuously updated] April Fools' Roundup: All the jokes from around the web Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/01 7:24pm PDTApr 1, 2017 15 Plus 1 on G+ 71 Share on Facebook 86 Share on Twitter Total Shares172 Google News NVIDIA Samsung T-Mobile Videos Article Contents 1 Google Gnome 2 Mrs. Pac-Man in Google Maps 3 Google's Bubble Wrap Keyboard 4 Google Assistant 5 Google Wind 6 Netflix Live 7 T-Mobile ONEsie 8 Hulu Hu 9 OnePlus Dash drink 10 Lyft Mono 11 Honor BFF 12 Google Haptic Helpers 13 Amazon Petlexa 14 Contour by SlickWraps 15 Nvidia GTX G-Assist 16 Google's data center on Mars 17 LineageOS' mascot 18 Chromebook accessories 19 Exynos Yoga Processor 20 Carved screen protector 21 I'm Feeling Woof/I'm Feeling Meow 22 Waze maps for Mars 23 JerryRigEverything's NoPhone video 24 Google Translate for Heptapod B 25 Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s 26 MKBHD's Nokia 3310 review 27 Open GApps Femto April Fools Day is almost upon us, but some companies aren't waiting to share their pranks. Google always does a great job, from the Pokemon Google Maps overlay to a smart mailbox, but there are a few from other companies worth mentioning. Here's a rundown of all the hillarious (or strange) tech-related April Fools Day jokes from around the web. Google Gnome One of Google's product launches from last year was the Google Home, a $129 smart speaker with Google Assistant. Now the company is teasing the "Google Gnome," an outside version of the Home. You can ask it weather questions, let it control your lawnmower and other tools, and even dress it up in accessories. The Google Gnome has a page on the Google Store, but unfortunately you can't buy it. I really want a rain coat for my Google Home, though. Mrs. Pac-Man in Google Maps For April Fools' 2015, Google added Pac-Man into Google Maps and Ingress. This year, Mrs Pac-Man is invading Google Maps. For regions of the world already on April 1st, a new Mrs. Pac-Man button is visible on the mobile app. You then have to control Mrs. Pac-Man on real-life streets, and of course, outrun the Ghosts. Google's Bubble Wrap Keyboard (English subtitles are available) Google Japan's prank is pretty funny - it's a bubble wrap keyboard. The idea is to pop bubbles on a bubble wrap sheet to form words, then feed the sheet through a reader to send the message. Some of the bubble wrap sheets are even scented. Google Assistant Google has plenty of Easter Eggs in Google Assistant, and as you might expect, there's one for April Fools' Day too. When asked, Assistant will offer advice on how not to get pranked, such as "If something seems too good to be true today, it probably is." Google Wind Google's Netherlands division has its own April Fools' Day gag, named 'Google Wind.' The idea is to use machine learning to control the weather, using Holland's famous windmills. I'll admit, this one is pretty great. Netflix Live Will Arnet has been in plenty of Netflix original content, from BoJack Horseman to A Series of Unfortunate Events. For April Fools' Day, Netflix is proud to share 'Netflix Live', which is nearly an hour of Arnett commentating ordinary events like toasting bread and completing a crossword puzzle. It's actually funnier than it sounds. You can watch the full thing here (a Netflix subscription is required). T-Mobile ONEsie T-Mobile's prank is a onesie, with "full-body coverage" and a built-in 4G LTE hotspot. You can actually buy it for $40, but the real one doesn't have any tech inside it. Hulu Hu With the claim that the human attention span has "dropped to eight seconds," Hulu has released 'Hu.' It's just a library of short clips from existing Hulu content, and you actually need an account to see them. This is probably the lamest April Fools' Day gag in the list - better luck next year, guys. OnePlus Dash drink OnePlus is really proud of its Dash Charge feature, even to the point of enlisting celebrities to talk about it. For April Fools', the company made real Dash Charge energy drinks. You can find our review of the drink here. Lyft Mono For April Fools' Day, Lyft has announced the 'Lyft Mono.' It's a wearable glove, vaguely resembling a Nintendo Power Glove. This gag is actually real, and once you put it on and get the app, sticking out your thumb will hail a Lyft cab. You can sign up to for a chance to get one here. Honor BFF We all need some positive reinforcement every now and then, right? Honor thinks so, and created the Honor BFF. This imaginary phone uses machine learning to periodically give you compliments and motivation. Hopefully it ships with Android 7.1 Nougat. Google Haptic Helpers This is probably my favorite gag so far. In order to create a more realistic virtual reality experience, you can schedule a "haptic helper" to come to your house and help create a more realistic environment. Just watch the video, it's hilarious. Amazon Petlexa Alexa is cool and all, but your furry friends need one too. As the name implies, Petlexa is Alexa for your pets. Contour by SlickWraps Putting a skin on your phone or tablet is too much work. For April Fool's Day, Slickwraps is teasing the 'Countour' - a machine that sprays on device skins. Frankly, I'm not sure if this is actually real or not, but there is a page for it on SlickWrap's store. Nvidia GTX G-Assist How many times have you been playing an online game, only to be interrupted by someone in real life? NVIDIA has made the 'G Assist,' a flash drive that can take over for you if you're busy. It can also help you beat boss battles, and provides periodic reminders to consume energy drinks. More information and a video can be found here. Google's data center on Mars If you have important data, you need a backup. That's why Google announced its first interplanetary data center, named "Ziggy Stardust," on the Google Cloud Platform Blog today. Located in the Gale Crater on Mars, it will store a cache of data from Earth to prevent irrecoverable loss when a planetary disaster strikes. Google hopes to finish the data center by 2018. LineageOS' mascot CyanogenMod's mascot, Cid, was one of the most recognizable icons in the Android community. As the spiritual successor to CyanogenMod, LineageOS has created its own mascot - 'Ink'. The project also announced 'Br0zip,' an artificial intelligence that can port LineageOS to any device in no time at all. Chromebook accessories Even though most Chromebooks can now run Android apps, you still can't use your Chromebook like an Android phone/tablet for all use cases. Until now, that is. Google has announced a Chromebook Groupie Stick (seen above), a Chromebook Cardboard headset, and a Chromebook armband. See the company's blog post for more info. Exynos Yoga Processor Remember when curved phones were a thing? Maybe we'll see more in the coming months, because Samsung has just unveiled the Exynos Yoga Processor - the first flexible mobile SoC. Anyone up for a Galaxy Flex? Carved screen protector Carved is a small Indiana-based phone case company, but now they are working on a wooden screen protector. Why hasn't this been done before? I'll take ten. I'm Feeling Woof/I'm Feeling Meow By force-touching the Google app icon in iOS, you can select "I'm Feeling Woof" or "I'm Feeling Meow." These give your pets access to the stuff they care about - from dog food to balls of yarn. More info can be found on Google's blog post. Waze maps for Mars According to the company's blog, Waze is has begun to map the surface of Mars. Certain members of the Waze community will also be sent to the Red Planet to more accurately map the surface. JerryRigEverything's NoPhone video If you haven't heard about it, the NoPhone is a solid piece of plastic designed to simulate the feeling of a phone in your pocket. I'm not really sure if anyone uses it, but JerryRigEverything is happy to break it just as much as any other phone. Google Translate for Heptapod B Using machine learning, Google Translate can now decrypt messages written in Heptapod B - the language from the film Arrival. On an unrelated note, it looks like someone from Google is still rocking a Nexus 10. See Google's blog post for more info. Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s ASUS has an April Fools gag too - the Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s Veritas Blue Limited Special Edition. I would probably buy this phone. MKBHD's Nokia 3310 review You may have heard about the updated Nokia 3310, but it turns out the original is an amazing smartphone. Okay, maybe not, but the video is pretty funny. Open GApps Femto Do you need to flash the latest Gapps package on your device, but you don't have a stable network connection? Not to worry, the Open GApps Femto package is here to help. It uses the United States HAARP service (which is not real, but just pretend) to download the latest GApps package. You can find more info at the GApps blog.   That concludes our coverage of April Fools' Day in the tech world. Let us know in the comments below which gag you liked the most!

Yeah they actuqally had me going until I compared a whois of kodi.tv vs kickasstorrents.com, a site that actually was seized. The whois data would show that it is not official. Derik Taylor So this is one I find interesting. Could it technically be a criminal offense to falsify a domain seizure? How would that work? mondeca I hope every year that Google will announce something real and awesome on April Fools' Day, like they did with Gmail. Once again, I am disappointed.

Peterson Silva "Frankly, I'm not sure if this is actually real or not" Well then THAT ought to be the best one! Trooper311 Gimme dat gnome yo. abqnm The Google Haptic Helpers was OK, until they applied the "I Voted!" sticker to the guy's shirt. I was laughing and crying at the same time. Corbin Davenport Yep, that had me laughing too. AdrianFDiratama . How about JG I'd actually like to see Google produce the Google Gnome.... All they'd need to do is add a battery (and Qi charging) to a Google Home and stick it in a new Gnome shell... Make sure its IP68 and maybe even MIL-STD-810G certified. It'd be a fun little gadget to put on the picnic table of your next summer back yard get together. Pump out some tunes, order pizza & Ubers for everyone to go home in, etc... Or take out when you work in the garden & don't want to get your phone dirty... Maybe even produce one with an LTE radio (and GPS). Then you could take it out of WiFi range camping. Wake up and find him chilling next to your tent in his little chair "Hey Google, how's today's weather? When does the rafting place open? How far away from the camp site is it?" cdotlawrence Maybe like a more customizable (from a looks standpoint), durable, & usable-on-go version of Home? Google Home Pro/Ultra? Interesting idea, but not sure why you wouldn't do most of the things it would do on your phone. Some specific use cases like you mentioned but beyond those, idk. Guess it'd be a highly functional, portable, durable and customizable speaker? Suicide_Note Ms. Pac-Man in Maps is live for me here in the US, even though it isn't April 1st yet. Daishi No Clarity Speaker??? Artem Russakovskii Why would that be in this post? Urmil Shroff What if we actually get the Mars data center many years from now? Eumelanin Knight I love this day. I just wish everyone kept up the pranks for the entire month like I do. Oddly enough.. I usually have less friends in May than I started with in April. How curious. Not sure why I brought that up. Totally unrelated. Josh Ewing VortexHornady Bullet-Cam https://youtu.be/hoGRlS53U_k Courtney King Google is so adorkable.

READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Adario Strange Apr 1st 2017 2:48PM April Fools' Day is the only "fake news" day that's almost welcome. Almost. And one of the longstanding masters of the tech prank, Google, is at it again with a fresh batch of trickery. This year, the jokes are more obviously fake this time around in what appears to be an effort to avoid anyone actually thinking these products actually exist. Nevertheless, some of these products would be kind of cool, despite how wildly impractical they are. Here's the running list of what Google's "rolled out" today so far: Google Gnome Although the name rhymes with the very real Google Home, this imagined Google digital assistant is instead designed to sit outdoors and help you out with all matters related to weekend backyard lounging and the occasional bit of garden work. Delivering information bits about weather, edible plant life and a surprisingly dark array of opinions, Google Gnome is what Google Home would be like if it showed up in an episode of Black Mirror — helpful, but just a tad too ominous with its robot apocalypse leanings. Haptic Helpers The quickest way to get a tech-centric laugh nowadays is to show some idiot fumbling around while blinded by yet another new VR headset. But Google smartly goes in another direction and actually addresses an issue that has yet to be solved in virtual reality: haptics. Haptic Helpers actually brings human Google workers into your home to assist you with your VR experience by providing you with all of the other sensory input that you can't otherwise get on current VR Systems. From smell, to taste, and even touch, Haptic Helpers show us the next best solution for full VR immersion until we actually have holodeck-level sensory input. Google Wind Stepping up the April Fools' Day game to a new level, Google's team in the Netherlands came up with an imaginary system called Google Wind that links the country's 1,170 windmills together using "machine learning [that] enables all the mills to collaborate." Once those windmills are linked, they are able to literally blow clouds out of the sky to allow the country to have more sun-filled days. Somehow, as ridiculous as this one looks, it's reminiscent of the very real weather modification initiatives that have been documented in years past. Nevertheless, the special effects showing people being blown away by the power of the windmill mechanisms adds just the right amount of whimsy to let you know that Google is in fact just playing around with yet another wild "what if" idea. Google Puchi Puchi Keyboard Also getting in on the international prank fun is Google Japan, whose team came up with perhaps the most ingenious fake gadget in a keyboard made of bubble wrap. The Puchi Puchi keyboard (in Japanese, "puchi puchi" translates as bubble wrap), allows the user to simultaneously enjoy the feeling of popping those tiny plastic bubbles included in packing materials while typing out a message. Once the message has been popped out, a Puchi Puchi reader rolls over the popped material to decipher the message. Yes, this is stupid. But for some reason, I actually want this. They even added a special version of the Puchi Puchi Keyboard that releases pleasant fragrances when you pop the bubbles, including air from places like Hawaii. Someone please actually make this. Google Cloud on Mars Definitely one of the biggest pranks on the list is Google's claim that it is launching a data center on Mars in 2018. The data center, named "Ziggy Stardust," is designed as an off-world backup in case Earth experiences some sort of catastrophe. Image: google "By opening a dedicated extraterrestrial cloud region, we're bringing the power of Google's compute, network, and storage to the rest of the solar system, unlocking a plethora of possibilities for astronomy research, exploration of Martian natural resources and interplanetary life sciences," reads the very long and detailed blog post accompanying the April Fools' gag. They even went as far as creating a data center location on Google Maps that you can explore. And while this may be a joke now, it's not unrealistic to imagine a very real Google data center on Mars in the decades ahead as companies like SpaceX work to colonize the red planet. Google Maps Ms. Pac-Man Finally, Google updated an old Google maps twist from 2015 by re-introducing its Pac-Man Google Maps game. In the current updated version on Android and iOS, you play Ms. Pac-Man using a map from anywhere in the world. Image: GOOGLE It's obvious why Google decided to rehash this one, it's incredibly addictive and deserves another look. Find your own neighborhood and try playing "just one" game and putting it down. So far, this looks like all the April Fools' Day weirdness Google has up its collective sleeve, but we'll keep our eyes open out for any new ones and add them as we find them.

The line between a successful prank and one that leaves users sighing, or worse, is micron-thin, and the boost to one's reputation -- or knock on it -- can hang around for some time. This year, we've rounded up some of the worst April Fools' pranks unleashed on a tech-savvy audience in recent memory. Gmail Tracks Back Last year, Google added a new button to Gmail that could append an animated GIF to an outgoing message. It depicted a Minion character dropping a microphone to signal the classic boast, "I'm out of this conversation -- nothing you can say will be better than what I just wrote." Unfortunately, Google placed the "Send with GIF" button right next to the regular "Send" button, causing all manner of social faux pas. Worse, the feature prevented the sender from seeing any subsequent replies. The Internet went a little crazy with reports suggesting that "Send with GIF" accidents had cost people jobs and friends -- or at least damaged relationships. Google disabled the tool before the end of the day and apologized. While it was a cute idea and surely raised a few smiles, the execution definitely could have used a little more finesse. Shots Fired Google's high volume of foolery each year means that it's bound to have plenty of appearances on any list of the worst Internet April Fools' pranks, and hey, look at that, here's another. In 2013, Google and Bing decided to poke some fun at each other. Google offered a tool called "Gmail Blue," apparently the result of a challenge to "completely redesign and recreate something, while keeping it exactly the same." It essentially gave Gmail a bluer theme instead of the default red look. This was Google's way of throwing shade at Microsoft, which at the time was working on a project called "Windows Blue" -- a redesign of Windows 8's metro mode with some new features. At the same time, Microsoft offered a different version of its Bing search engine, taking aim at the most well-known place on the Internet: the Google homepage. When users entered "Google" into Bing's search field, they were rewarded with a sparse white page sporting a colorful Bing logo and an "I'm Feeling Confused" button, a riff on Google's "I'm Feeling Lucky" option. Microsoft aimed a couple more direct barbs at Google, along the lines of this tooltip: "With so many delicious flavors available, most people still choose vanilla." Microsoft also suggested the aim of the prank page was "to learn more about how our world would look if we hadn't evolved." Relatively inoffensive, sure, but the missives from both sides seemed somewhat petty and didn't make either company look good. One wonders what interesting new feature might have popped up had the engineers working on each "prank" decided to work on something actually productive or funny. Microsoft's Insta-Ham Speaking of Microsoft and 2013 April Fools pranks, the company allowed an Instagram app logo to sneak into its Windows Phone app store -- but, haha, there was no app to download. It was a mean-spirited, ill-conceived joke, as many Windows Phone owners had been desperate for an Instagram app. It's likely that an independent developer carried out the prank, but I can't imagine why Microsoft wouldn't have vetted an app with that particular name, given that the joke only served to annoy its users. Vwls Pls! As much as I love and cherish Twitter, I don't think I'll ever forgive it for teasing a new premium product that might have brought about an end to the English language as we know it. It suggested that everyone could still use Twitter as a basic service, but only its new premium version would display vowels -- you'd have to shell out some cash to see complete tweets. It's an obvious nod to the company's original name, Twttr, and in all honesty, not a terrible joke. But, my word, would I have subscribed to that premium account in a heartbeat. I am all for people expressing themselves however they need to, but I'd urge them to do so with a semblance of grammar and proper spelling. A Twitter without vowels would be a nightmare. Twitter might be onto something with this subscription idea, though. I'd happily hand Twitter money every month if it helped get rid of all the trolls and reprobates. It's a Match In 2015, Tinder and Uber teamed up to combine their services and create Tinder for Uber and Uber for Tinder. Make a Tinder match with an Uber driver and split the fare, or make a Tinder match with someone else and automatically request Uber rides to meet somewhere in the middle. It is, on the surface, a pair of silly ideas welded together in a way that makes sense for our modern world. However, it seems a little shortsighted given the concerns many have about inappropriate advances from drivers in the best of times, let alone when a c Kris Holt is a writer and editor based in Montreal.

Name: Subject: Message: We need to talk about Samsung’s Bixby Features Newsby Brian Reigh12 hours ago 35 952 23 Inside Samsung’s latest Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus lives Bixby, the company’s second attempt at AI assistant. While it may be too early to tell whether Bixby truly adds any practicality, unfortunately, my first impression tells me this could potentially be another S-Voice fiasco. See also: Samsung Galaxy S8 feature focus: Bixby 17 hours ago To the competition, welcome, young Padawan Samsung isn’t exactly new to the realm of AI assistants: after all, the company did launch the infamous S-Voice with the Galaxy S3 way back when. A poor imitation of Apple’s Siri at best, S-Voice was heavily criticized, quickly forgotten, and slowly became one of those apps that you disable right from the moment you get your phone. Well, after endless rumors and its acquisition of Viv, an AI platform developed by none other than the makers of Siri, the South Korean company finally unveiled Bixby. That’s right – the subpar S-Voice has officially been fired, and Bixby is the new assistant with a fresh voice who will be living inside your latest Galaxy smartphones. It’s true that virtual assistants are the next big thing, but in a world dominated by the likes of Alexa, Cortana, Siri, and most of all, Google Assistant, is there really a place for Bixby? It’s true that virtual assistants are the next big thing, but in a world dominated by the likes of Alexa, Cortana, Siri, and most of all, Google Assistant, is there really a place for Bixby? Alexa boasts support for an incredible range of smart devices; Siri is now more mature and lives inside popular gadgets like the Apple Watch and the MacBook; Google Assistant uses the search giant’s data to deliver seamless information to most Android phones. And Bixby? There are several differentiating factors according to Samsung. To begin with, there is a physical button that summons Bixby. Instead of answering to your voice command, you can press the button anywhere inside an app to bring up your assistant. As Samsung puts it, it’s a multi-nodal intelligence service, meaning it uses context – whether you are currently in the Gallery or Camera – to complete its actions. On top of that, features like Bixby Vision and Bixby Search integrate smart object-recognition technology right into the device’s native apps. Samsung is also expected to bring Bixby to its vast roster of home appliances, so Bixby might prove itself to be more or less useful depending on your home. Nonetheless, I can’t help but think Samsung’s offering is just far too incomplete to be competitive against what’s out there. From the demos we saw, from the way it works, and from a practical standpoint, I am not convinced that Samsung has created an AI assistant that is intelligent and useful enough. A little less conversation and a little more “touch my body” Though Ariana Grande might tell you otherwise, a little more “touch my body” is what concerns me. Samsung thinks that repeated voice activation requests are an unnecessary step for the user, and while I agree to an extent, I think having the option to summon Bixby with a voice command is essential. My personal experience tells me that virtual assistants are far more useful when they work without requiring any physical touch. Though Samsung’s focus seems to be on in-app actions – so while you are holding the phone in your hand – my personal experience tells me that virtual assistants are far more useful when they work without requiring any physical touch. For example, I use Google Assistant on my phone only when I am unable (or unwilling) to physically get my phone and unlock it: when you wake up at 7AM and want to check the weather or when your hands are covered in butter and flour and you need to a quick unit conversion. While the all-new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus have Google Assistant also on board for these situations, the sheer necessity to use Google Assistant in these situations highlights Bixby’s limitations. Perhaps voice commands will come to Bixby in the future, but for now, its dedicated button doesn’t make you all that dedicated to Bixby. Samsung widens the Android fragmentation Speaking of Google Assistant, Bixby’s existence means that Samsung is again worsening the Android fragmentation problem, making Google unhappy and leaving users confused. When I read reports claiming that Google may have tried to keep Samsung from pre-installing Bixby onto its flagship devices, I wasn’t all that surprised. Whether it’s true or not, this move makes sense not only because Bixby would become a rival to Google’s own Assistant but also because this would worsen the one problem that Android has persistently faced since its inception: fragmentation. I don’t use the f-word lightly, but unlike S-Voice, Bixby is deeply-integrated and threatens the fundamental Android experience. Of course, Samsung has always been good at making Android not Android (for better or worse), but when its software becomes obtrusive and harmful to Google Assistant inside an OS designed by Google, it becomes a problem. Your average consumer doesn’t know what the difference between the two is, but still, Bixby greets you when you press the button below the volume rocker, yet Google Assistant answers when you press and hold the home button: it’s simply a lot going on when there doesn’t need to be this much chaos. It’s simply a lot going on when there doesn’t need to be this much chaos. Third-party support or the lack thereof What Samsung demonstrated is, objectively speaking, very neat: you can go into your gallery, select a few photos, summon Bixby and ask it to create an album called “Family Photos.” Or you can take a photo with Bixby Vision right inside your camera app, and it’ll tell you what it is, provide nearby sights if it’s a place or give you shopping recommendations if it’s a product. These are some of the things that no other AI assistants can do because they don’t live inside other apps. However, the issue is that Bixby supports only 10 apps at launch, and these are all Samsung’s own native apps. So what happens if you don’t use Samsung’s gallery but Google Photos instead? What if you use Chrome instead of Samsung’s browser? Bixby will be an afterthought for many developers whose priority lies within assistants like Google Assistant, Alexa, and Siri. Samsung says that third-party support is coming, but that’s going to be a big challenge even for a company of this size and power. Bixby only lives within two devices as of now and will probably be confined to few Samsung devices even in the future, so Bixby will be an afterthought for many developers whose priority lies within assistants like Google Assistant, Alexa, and Siri. How many apps support Samsung’s “edge panels” after two years? Virtually none. Bixby doesn’t offer anything extraordinary to change this pattern, and without extensive third-party support, Bixby will meet the same fate as S-Voice, tucked away and never used. Launch day was barely over before some were calling for a replacement assistant for the Bixby button. Bixby will grow, but this baby needs to grow fast With all these setbacks, Bixby needs to perform well at least. Unfortunately, from what we saw from early demos, things aren’t looking too bright for this nascent assistant. In a controlled demo, when asked to set the brightness to 50 percent or display the latest photos taken with the phone, it took its sweet time, telling us to “Hold on.” To be fair, it did all of its tasks well eventually (though its performance in real life remains to be seen); however, compared to the speed and natural diction of Google Assistant, it’s still far behind. Of course, Bixby is bound to improve. Samsung said so when it first unveiled it: the company specifically said that this is only the first step, and that the company’s vision of revolutionizing AI will take time. Although I am underwhelmed by Bixby after so much hype, I am excited to see how it will grow. Just one thing though – Bixby needs to grow fast because the moment users and developers think it’s just another gimmicky bloatware by Samsung, it will be fired, just like its predecessor.

Google always does a great job, from the Pokemon Google Maps overlay to a smart mailbox, but there are a few from other companies worth mentioning. Here's a rundown of all the hillarious (or strange) tech-related April Fools Day jokes from around the web. Google Gnome One of Google's product launches from last year was the Google Home, a $129 smart speaker with Google Assistant. Now the company is teasing the "Google Gnome," an outside version of the Home. You can ask it weather questions, let it control your lawnmower and other tools, and even dress it up in accessories. The Google Gnome has a page on the Google Store, but unfortunately you can't buy it. I really want a rain coat for my Google Home, though. Mrs. Pac-Man in Google Maps For April Fools' 2015, Google added Pac-Man into Google Maps and Ingress. This year, Mrs Pac-Man is invading Google Maps. For regions of the world already on April 1st, a new Mrs. Pac-Man button is visible on the mobile app. You then have to control Mrs. Pac-Man on real-life streets, and of course, outrun the Ghosts. Google's Bubble Wrap Keyboard (English subtitles are available) Google Japan's prank is pretty funny - it's a bubble wrap keyboard. The idea is to pop bubbles on a bubble wrap sheet to form words, then feed the sheet through a reader to send the message. Some of the bubble wrap sheets are even scented. Google Assistant Google has plenty of Easter Eggs in Google Assistant, and as you might expect, there's one for April Fools' Day too. When asked, Assistant will offer advice on how not to get pranked, such as "If something seems too good to be true today, it probably is." Google Wind Google's Netherlands division has its own April Fools' Day gag, named 'Google Wind.' The idea is to use machine learning to control the weather, using Holland's famous windmills. I'll admit, this one is pretty great. Netflix Live Will Arnet has been in plenty of Netflix original content, from BoJack Horseman to A Series of Unfortunate Events. For April Fools' Day, Netflix is proud to share 'Netflix Live', which is nearly an hour of Arnett commentating ordinary events like toasting bread and completing a crossword puzzle. It's actually funnier than it sounds. You can watch the full thing here (a Netflix subscription is required). T-Mobile ONEsie T-Mobile's prank is a onesie, with "full-body coverage" and a built-in 4G LTE hotspot. You can actually buy it for $40, but the real one doesn't have any tech inside it. Hulu Hu With the claim that the human attention span has "dropped to eight seconds," Hulu has released 'Hu.' It's just a library of short clips from existing Hulu content, and you actually need an account to see them. This is probably the lamest April Fools' Day gag in the list - better luck next year, guys. OnePlus Dash drink OnePlus is really proud of its Dash Charge feature, even to the point of enlisting celebrities to talk about it. For April Fools', the company made real Dash Charge energy drinks. You can find our review of the drink here. Lyft Mono For April Fools' Day, Lyft has announced the 'Lyft Mono.' It's a wearable glove, vaguely resembling a Nintendo Power Glove. This gag is actually real, and once you put it on and get the app, sticking out your thumb will hail a Lyft cab. You can sign up to for a chance to get one here. Honor BFF We all need some positive reinforcement every now and then, right? Honor thinks so, and created the Honor BFF. This imaginary phone uses machine learning to periodically give you compliments and motivation. Hopefully it ships with Android 7.1 Nougat. Google Haptic Helpers This is probably my favorite gag so far. In order to create a more realistic virtual reality experience, you can schedule a "haptic helper" to come to your house and help create a more realistic environment. Just watch the video, it's hilarious. Amazon Petlexa Alexa is cool and all, but your furry friends need one too. As the name implies, Petlexa is Alexa for your pets. Contour by SlickWraps Putting a skin on your phone or tablet is too much work. For April Fool's Day, Slickwraps is teasing the 'Countour' - a machine that sprays on device skins. Frankly, I'm not sure if this is actually real or not, but there is a page for it on SlickWrap's store. Nvidia GTX G-Assist How many times have you been playing an online game, only to be interrupted by someone in real life? NVIDIA has made the 'G Assist,' a flash drive that can take over for you if you're busy. It can also help you beat boss battles, and provides periodic reminders to consume energy drinks. More information and a video can be found here. Google's data center on Mars If you have important data, you need a backup. That's why Google announced its first interplanetary data center, named "Ziggy Stardust," on the Google Cloud Platform Blog today. Located in the Gale Crater on Mars, it will store a cache of data from Earth to prevent irrecoverable loss when a planetary disaster strikes. Google hopes to finish the data center by 2018. LineageOS' mascot CyanogenMod's mascot, Cid, was one of the most recognizable icons in the Android community. As the spiritual successor to CyanogenMod, LineageOS has created its own mascot - 'Ink'. The project also announced 'Br0zip,' an artificial intelligence that can port LineageOS to any device in no time at all. Chromebook accessories Even though most Chromebooks can now run Android apps, you still can't use your Chromebook like an Android phone/tablet for all use cases. Until now, that is. Google has announced a Chromebook Groupie Stick (seen above), a Chromebook Cardboard headset, and a Chromebook armband. See the company's blog post for more info. Exynos Yoga Processor Remember when curved phones were a thing? Maybe we'll see more in the coming months, because Samsung has just unveiled the Exynos Yoga Processor - the first flexible mobile SoC. Anyone up for a Galaxy Flex? Carved screen protector Carved is a small Indiana-based phone case company, but now they are working on a wooden screen protector. Why hasn't this been done before? I'll take ten. I'm Feeling Woof/I'm Feeling Meow By force-touching the Google app icon in iOS, you can select "I'm Feeling Woof" or "I'm Feeling Meow." These give your pets access to the stuff they care about - from dog food to balls of yarn. More info can be found on Google's blog post. Waze maps for Mars According to the company's blog, Waze is has begun to map the surface of Mars. Certain members of the Waze community will also be sent to the Red Planet to more accurately map the surface. JerryRigEverything's NoPhone video If you haven't heard about it, the NoPhone is a solid piece of plastic designed to simulate the feeling of a phone in your pocket. I'm not really sure if anyone uses it, but JerryRigEverything is happy to break it just as much as any other phone. Google Translate for Heptapod B Using machine learning, Google Translate can now decrypt messages written in Heptapod B - the language from the film Arrival. On an unrelated note, it looks like someone from Google is still rocking a Nexus 10. See Google's blog post for more info. Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s ASUS has an April Fools gag too - the Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s Veritas Blue Limited Special Edition. I would probably buy this phone. MKBHD's Nokia 3310 review You may have heard about the updated Nokia 3310, but it turns out the original is an amazing smartphone. Okay, maybe not, but the video is pretty funny. Open GApps Femto Do you need to flash the latest Gapps package on your device, but you don't have a stable network connection? Not to worry, the Open GApps Femto package is here to help. It uses the United States HAARP service (which is not real, but just pretend) to download the latest GApps package. You can find more info at the GApps blog.   That concludes our coverage of April Fools' Day in the tech world. Let us know in the comments below which gag you liked the most!

Corbin Davenport Yep, that had me laughing too. AdrianFDiratama . How about JG I'd actually like to see Google produce the Google Gnome.... All they'd need to do is add a battery (and Qi charging) to a Google Home and stick it in a new Gnome shell... Make sure its IP68 and maybe even MIL-STD-810G certified. It'd be a fun little gadget to put on the picnic table of your next summer back yard get together. Pump out some tunes, order pizza & Ubers for everyone to go home in, etc... Or take out when you work in the garden & don't want to get your phone dirty... Maybe even produce one with an LTE radio (and GPS). Then you could take it out of WiFi range camping.

How far away from the camp site is it?" cdotlawrence Maybe like a more customizable (from a looks standpoint), durable, & usable-on-go version of Home? Google Home Pro/Ultra? Interesting idea, but not sure why you wouldn't do most of the things it would do on your phone. Some specific use cases like you mentioned but beyond those, idk. Guess it'd be a highly functional, portable, durable and customizable speaker? Suicide_Note Ms. Pac-Man in Maps is live for me here in the US, even though it isn't April 1st yet.

Luma 2-pack is $179 ($71 off) on The Home Depot for today only Martim Lobao Follow View All Posts 2017/03/31 4:15pm PDTMar 31, 2017 5 Plus 1 on G+ 14 Share on Facebook 36 Share on Twitter Total Shares55 Deals We've been seeing more and more competition among mesh Wi-Fi networking kits over the past few months, with even Google dipping its toe into the segment with Google Wifi back in October of last year. One big advantage Google Wifi has over some of its competitors that have been on the market for a while longer is price: whereas a three-pack from eero would set you back $499 and $399 from Luma, one from Google costs only $299. To make up for that, many companies have been lowering their prices significantly, with eero taking $100 off its triple set of routers and $50 off its two-pack system in February. The Home Depot is also running a pretty significant sale on pairs of Luma on its website, slashing the price from $250 (apparently The Home Depot was already selling it for $49 less than Luma itself) down to $179, bringing it into perfect price parity with a Google Wifi two-pack. The offer is available exclusively online and ends today, so if you've been holding off buying a Luma, now is probably the time to go ahead and buy one.

Show Caption of Expand By Tatiana Sanchez | tsanchez@bayareanewsgroup.com | PUBLISHED: April 1, 2017 at 9:19 am | UPDATED: April 1, 2017 at 7:31 pm Ms. Pac Man, gnomes and pink bodysuits. Oh my! It’s April Fools’ Day and tech companies in the Bay Area and beyond want to get you started off on the right foot with some wacky hijinks. The wide range of pranks, faux products and spoofs — many mocking Silicon Valley’s tech-obsessed culture — are part of a long tradition that gives businesses ranging from small startups to global corporate giants a chance to show off their senses of humor. Related Articles What are the best April Fools’ Day pranks for 2017? Cats ordering sushi with Amazon’s Echo? Car horn emojis? Silicon Valley gets its April Fools’ on Silicon Valley ignores April Fools’ Day — April Fools! April Fools’ Day: Memorable pranks in Silicon Valley If you’ve ever dreamed of taking a trip back to the ’80s to enjoy a game of Pac Man, today’s your lucky day. Google launched a Pac Man feature on Google Maps Friday that lets users help Ms. Pac Man gobble up dots through a maze, while avoiding the dreaded “monsters” or ghosts. The company followed up hours later with the release of Google Gnome, a smart helper for the yard that can answer burning questions like, “What sound does an opossum make?” It can trim your hedges, turn your garden hose on and off and controls lawnmowers or leaf blowers, according to the company. Oh, and in case you hadn’t guessed, it resembles a garden gnome — red hat and all. So don’t mow that lawn today — have a margarita and let the gnome take care of it instead! Google’s latest trick was released at midnight Friday and this one is for our furry, four-legged friends. The company’s app got a temporary update on iOS that allows for custom in-product searching for dogs and cats. The feature, called “I’m feeling woof and I’m feeling meow,” will generate images that are satisfying to our furry companions — think raw tuna and dog toys. To give this a spin, have your cats and dogs go to “settings” in the Google app on iOS. In its own nod to the beloved pets of the world, Amazon debuted its Petlexa technology, which lets virtual home assistant Echo communicate with animals. A video for the product showed the device tracking a hamster’s steps as it ran endlessly on a hamster wheel and a cat calling on the device to order sushi. With a few barks, Petlexa can launch an automatic ball thrower. T-Mobile released its first-ever “ONEsie,” a bright pink body suit that is the literal meaning of “unlimited coverage.” The suit tracks all of your body’s movements in real time — think of it as wearing a giant Fitbit — while 4G LTE nanofibers turn you into a walking, talking human Wi-Fi hotspot. You can also charge the suit using motion and body heat. When it’s time to wake up, a built-in alarm literally shakes you awake. The suit is also very fashion-forward, according to T-Mobile. Talk about taking a step into the future. Honda poked fun at people’s obsession with emojis by releasing “Horn Emojis,” a driver-to-driver communication system that lets drivers customize their car horns depending on their mood, with the simple press of an emoji button. The idea became an instant favorite following its release on Saturday. The Las-Vegas based online shoe and clothing shop Zappos has the answer to all your delivery woes: Its new delivery boxes can become invisible with the click of a button, never to be stolen off your porch again. Lyft got things going Thursday, giving fans a sneak peek of  “autonomous ride-hailing” with a new gadget called Mono. When wearing the device, essentially a high-tech glove, users can request a ride without even bothering to pull out their smartphones. “With Mono, we want to make the entire ridesharing process as seamless as possible,” Lyft wrote in a blog post, “whether you’re a bellman who can’t whistle or a mom with her hands full; a nudist who needs a ride.” And since we like to obsessively track our daily activities– our calorie intake, exercise and sleeping habits, just to name a few– why not track our business in the bathroom? Quilted Northern released uSit Saturday, “the world’s first biometric tracking device designed to record everything you do in the bathroom.” The product collects data and analyzes bathroom trips, “including duration, frequency and exertion levels. It enables you to set personal goals, earn badges, share progress on social media, and even compete against friends and family in healthy competitions. It also comes with a custom ergonomic belt that integrates seamlessly into any wardrobe,” a spokeswoman said in a statement. Staff writer Marisa Kendall contributed to this report.

By Jon Gold Senior Writer, Network World | Apr 1, 2017 10:20 AM PT Credit: Google/Youtube Related Virtual reality, one year out: What went right, what didn't Can VR make the jump from oddity to mainstream? I'm having doubts April Fools from the tech industry Video Mobile connectivity issues plague many enterprises Tech companies like to get into April Fool’s day – those whimsical titans of capitalism – and nobody gets into it in a bigger way than Google, which rolls out a solid handful of gags every year, some of which are even interactive. This year is no exception, as the search titan deploys its finest humor modules to delight us for a day before going back to trying to manage all the information on earth in a totally non-creepy way. ALSO ON NETWORK WORLD:  White House to issue commemorative solar eclipse safety glasses Here’s our official, expert judgment on Google’s 2017 April Fool’s jokes: 1. Google Wind Repurposing Holland’s famous windmills to act as weather controllers, guided by (naturally) the sophisticated Google Cloud Platform is a funny idea, and the video is both convincingly acted and well-produced. I particularly liked the kid in the swing. Grade: A. Goed werk, Google. 2. Ms. Pac-Man on Google Maps It’s still fun, without question, but Google did this back in 2015, letting you play any given slice of Google Maps as Pac-Man. Given that I’m lousy at Pac-Man and I was able to win a round based on my neighborhood, it seems like it’s not that challenging, or maybe my particular part of Brighton lends itself to simple Pac-Manning. (Idea – Peyton Manning as Pac-Man. Pac-Manning.) To try it out yourself, just go to Google Maps and click the “insert coin” button in the bottom left. Grade: B-. It’s fun, but come on, something new, please. 3. Google Gnome First of all, that’s a great name, although once you see this thing you’ll wonder whether Travelocity’s lawyers are working this weekend. It’s Google Home for the outdoors, so you can ask it to do things like turn on a hose, tell you about the weather, or, well, you can probably just watch it: Despite his protestations, this is all absolutely the fault of Verge editor Dieter Bohn, who tweeted a Google Gnome joke a couple weeks ago and prompted this strange dosage of Google-powered strangeness to enter all of our lives, and I will hear no evidence to the contrary. The gnome laughing when being bothered by the dog was unsettling, since we’re not used to hearing the automated voices of the Siris and Alexas of the world laugh. Grade: A-. It’s silly, but that’s a good name and this was authentically weird in a way that even Google’s better pranks frequently aren’t. 4. Google VR Haptic Helpers One of the main stumbling blocks on the road to turning VR into a Star Trek holodeck is the senses that aren’t sight and hearing. Google is attempting to address the rest of them with the Haptic Helper program, which is awesome. This is the most realistic solution yet to the problem of how to broaden VR experiences, frankly, and these multi-sensory Foley artists are laudable. Plus, there’s just something about a serious-looking guy determinedly wafting perfume into a VR user’s face that is impossible not to enjoy. The application I’d like to see is for the VR version of visiting Yankee Stadium, where a guy drives to your house, takes too much money out of your pocket, and calls you horrible names for wearing a Red Sox hat. Grade: A. I’m still laughing at the guy making fried eggs. 5. Mars Google Cloud Platform will open a data center on the red planet, to better serve the needs of Martians and offer its IaaS product to users beyond the skies of Earth. “By opening a dedicated extraterrestrial cloud region, we're bringing the power of Google’s compute, network, and storage to the rest of the solar system, unlocking a plethora of possibilities for astronomy research, exploration of Martian natural resources and interplanetary life sciences,” said the Cloud Platform team in an official blog post. Google The company even lets you walk around inside its fictional Martian data center via Street View, which is fun. Grade: B. It’s well-executed, but the core concept just wasn’t all that screamingly funny. 6. Google Play for Pets Even though animals have been known to play with tablets and phones already, Google is upping the ante with Google Play for Pets, so you don’t feel bad about leaving your furry friend at home with nothing to do while you go to work. Sadly, the pets section of the Play Store doesn’t appear to be available to me at the moment, so any nearby animals are going to have to amuse themselves the old-fashioned way, but Play for Pets promises “thousands of games, apps, and training tools,” along with notifications so you can follow Bitsy’s progress chasing digital mice, and even match your pets up to see which is the champion of a certain game. Grade: B-. It’s a cute video, but it feels unfinished. Join the Network World communities on Facebook and LinkedIn to comment on topics that are top of mind.

If you don’t have $700-$800 to spend on the latest Galaxy S7 Edge or Google Pixel, we have you covered. Below we’ve round-up a list of the best Android smartphones under $300. Many of which are great choices here in 2017. Not everyone wants to spend top dollar for a new phone or sign a 2-year contract. This is why cheap phones are getting more and more popular. Over the past few years we’ve seen an influx of premium devices for under $399. It’s a popular trend, but we can get even cheaper. Read: Best Android Phones Under $100 If you’re like millions of customers looking for a cheaper route, read on for more details. These are some of the absolute best Android phones for under $300. Devices that are actually worth the big savings, work great and still deliver a good experience. The best part of Google’s Android OS is the wide selection from different manufacturers. There is something for everyone in all shapes and sizes. Now days there are cheap options from ASUS, Google, LG, Motorola, OnePlus and many other brands you’d never expect. The result are phones that are under $300 yet still amazingly awesome devices that owners will love. One problem with budget phones we see from carriers or online is the quality. Many are awful brands that never see updates, have outdated specs, terrible screens or are Chinese devices that simply won’t be enjoyable. Those are what you want to avoid. Our suggestions are all around or under $300 but are still some of the best Android smartphones in the eyes of many users. These phones are wallet-friendly and work great. The list below is in no particular order, although Google’s own Nexus 5X could be one of the best choices of all. Consider one of these cheap Android phones today. Google Nexus 5X   1 / 12 Google's Nexus 5x is a well-rounded smartphone that was released near the end of 2015. It already runs the latest Android 7.1.1 Nougat release, will see fast updates, and has all the latest features one would want. Like a fingerprint scanner, quad-core processor, a great camera, dual front facing speakers and USB Type-C. When it was first released Google charged $379 and $429 for the phone, but we've seen heavy discounts lately. It can be found for under $300 now that the Pixel is available. Google last charged $329 for the 16GB model before removing it from their store. It's barely a year old so there is no reason to pass on it. Get one from Best Buy, Newegg or eBay. This phone delivers on all the essentials for less than $300. The only downside is the plastic design, rather than a premium metal some would get with a Samsung or iPhone. It's available for just $279 from the popular site Newegg. And that's with 32GB of storage. If storage isn't a concern, unlocked 16GB models are $259 on eBay.  Buy the Nexus 5X on eBay for $259   1 / 12 4 Responses 12/01/2016 Steve Reply The 2015 ZTE Axon Pro smokes most of these and is selling for under $275 01/02/2017 ammy96429 Reply I found a great site that focuses on stay at home mom’s complete guide to gaining a serious amount of money in very little time.

LG is able to repair the phones because the mother boards are no longer available. –that is why some people are not selling them and they are cheaper! They are great while they work but that is too much money for pay for less than a year! 04/01/2017 AnotherHiggins Reply I’m looking for a new phone for my wife because her Nexus 5X turned itself off yesterday and now won’t get past a bootloop. It is 15 months old and from everything I’m reading online there’s no fix for it. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published. Comment Name* Email* Website

What a week! From big announcements to juicy rumors, and some truly shocking surprises, it’s been a rollercoaster ride around the tech world… but fear not, for 7 Days is here again to make sure you didn’t miss any of the week’s top stories. There’s a lot to get through, so let’s waste no more time! Image via Shutterstock The US House of Representatives agreed to the contents of a bill approved by the Senate last week, which will scrap FCC rules to protect broadband users' privacy. The bill will allow internet service providers to sell users' web browsing history and other personal data without their explicit consent. Twitter made a significant change, removing @mentions from the 140-character count in tweets. It follows a similar move last year in which pics, videos, polls and quoted tweets were removed from the count, allowing users to say more within the existing character limit. A South Korean regulator found that Qualcomm has been pressuring Samsung to restrict sales of its Exynos processors to other manufacturers, unfairly restricting competition to protect sales of its own Snapdragon chips. Meanwhile, another chipmaker has been accused of "unacceptable and unethical" behavior. SemiAccurate slammed Intel for allegedly misleading the press by withholding key data about its new Optane memory technology. There was exciting news in India, where the country's first 1Gbps broadband service was launched - but there is a 1TB monthly cap on downloads and uploads. Over in the US, billionaire-entrepreneur Elon Musk has launched a new company called Neuralink, which plans to improve the human mind with digital technology. He believes that developing artificially enhanced brains is a necessity for the long-term survival of our species. In somewhat more mundane - but still welcome - news, Apple released the latest updates to its operating systems on Monday - iOS 10.3, macOS 10.12.4 Sierra, watchOS 3.2 and tvOS 10.2 - bringing a handful of new features and improvements. Google announced that its Home speaker hub will launch in the UK next week, priced at £129. But there was bad news for Google, which has lost the support of over 250 major advertisers following YouTube's placement of their ads in videos posted by extremist groups. Google began informing users this week that it's preparing to launch a "new look" for the sign-in experience for its services, which is expected to show up "in the next few weeks". Almost two months have passed since Google announced the release of Android Wear 2.0, and said it would come to existing devices "in the coming weeks". Since then, not a single device had received the update until this week, when it began rolling out for three devices. However, Google then slammed on the brakes on that rollout after discovering a "last-minute bug". Android Wear 2.0 had already been delayed by several months. Android co-founder Andy Rubin - who left Google a few years ago - teased an upcoming handset from his company, Essential. The handset, which appears to have a bezel-less design - as is the big trend these days - was confirmed by Alphabet chairman Eric Schmidt to run Android. Photos and key specs were revealed of another new Android handset this week. The new Moto X is expected to be officially unveiled in the next few months. Fresh details also emerged on the HTC U, another new flagship on the way following the launch of the U Ultra earlier this year. It sounds like the U Ultra should have the superior specs, but confusingly, it seems the U will be the better device, with a more powerful Snapdragon 835 processor, and touch-sensitive bezels offering a new way to interact with the OS. The new BlackBerry KEYone has been delayed, following its unveiling at the Mobile World Congress a few weeks ago. The Android handset, which features a fixed QWERTY keyboard below its 4.5-inch display, was due to go on sale in April. Seven months after its release, Android 7.0 Nougat is on just 2.8% of the platform's active devices so far. Its long, slow rollout continued this week: Moto G4 Plus in the US Samsung Galaxy Note 5 in India Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+ in Europe HTC One A9 in Europe HTC 10 on Verizon Unfortunately, T-Mobile US raised the hopes of HTC One M8 owners on Monday when it said the Nougat update was "now available" for that device. It wasn't, and the carrier later said it was a mistake. More devices received the latest Android security patches this week too: Sony Xperia Z5, Z4 Tablet, and Z3+ Samsung Galaxy Note 4 on Sprint Samsung Galaxy S5 in Europe Samsung Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge in the US If it had been revealed a few days later, you might have thought this was an April Fools' Day joke. Samsung confirmed that it will sell refurbished units of its Galaxy Note7 - the fiery flagship that it recalled, twice, following a series of battery fires last year. But the big announcement of the week was the official unveiling of Samsung's new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ flagships: Overview of key info on the new handsets, including specs and main features DeX, the new PC-like desktop experience for the Galaxy S8 and S8+ DeX Station, the desktop dock with multiple ports and a cooling fan, priced at $149.99 Bixby, Samsung's new digital assistant... which will have some notable limitations at launch Samsung's initial production run will be around 20 million units New Gear 360 camera revealed with True 4K video capture The Galaxy S8 offers multiple security features, including facial recognition, an iris scanner, a fingerprint sensor, and more 'conventional' methods for unlocking the device, such as PIN and pattern unlock. However, it seems the facial recognition feature can be fooled into unlocking the device using just a photo. This isn't an April Fools' Day joke either: Microsoft announced on March 30 that it will be selling Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ 'Microsoft Edition' handsets at its retail stores. It said that "when the devices are unboxed and connected to Wi-Fi", they will apply a "customization" that includes its Office, OneDrive, Cortana and Outlook apps, among others. The announcement was met with surprise and incredulity among many fans of Windows phones, with some claiming that it demonstrates Microsoft's lack of focus on the Windows 10 Mobile platform. All of Microsoft's Windows phones have now reached the end of their retail lives. Two days before the Galaxy S8 event, Microsoft removed the last of its Lumia handsets from its UK store. Pre-orders opened on the Microsoft Store in the UK for the Porsche Design Book One, a Surface Book-style Windows 10 2-in-1 that Microsoft describes as the "convertible of your dreams". Priced at £2,395, it has a detachable display, Pen support, and the latest 7th-generation Intel Core i7 processors - but bizarrely, there's no discrete GPU option. Since February, when Microsoft announced significant price increases on its Surface Book and Pro 4 in the UK, not a day has gone by when the company hasn't been selling them with some sort of deal available. This week, it launched yet another promotional offer, reducing their prices to the same level as before it raised them. On Wednesday, Microsoft opened pre-orders for its Surface Book with Performance Base in 13 new markets around the world. It also opened pre-orders for its high-end 28-inch all-in-one PC, the Surface Studio, and the Surface Dial interaction tool, in three new countries. In unwelcome news for Microsoft, the company is being sued by people alleging that Windows 10 has "destroyed" their data and damaged their PCs. The lawsuit accuses Microsoft of having "failed to exercise reasonable care in designing, formulating, and manufacturing the Windows 10 upgrade and placing it into the stream of commerce." With the release of the Windows 10 Creators Update fast approaching, Stardock released a new version of its popular customization software for the OS, WindowBlinds. The 10.6 update includes a wide range of improvements for the latest Windows 10 version. The Windows 10 Creators Update is coming very soon indeed. Microsoft announced that it will be released via Windows Update for PCs starting on April 11, but you'll be able to install it manually from April 5. Microsoft published ISOs for build 15063 - the 'RTM' build for the Creators Update - along with its latest SDK for the same build. Windows 10 Mobile devices will get the Creators Update from April 25 - but from Microsoft's careful phrasing, it sounds like there may be some limitations on which handsets will actually be able to install it. Microsoft also revealed the first details about the Creators Update for Windows 10 Team, the specialized version of the OS that runs on its Surface Hub collaboration device. Microsoft is continuing to test bug fixes and other minor improvements for cumulative updates that will accompany the release of the Creators Update next month. Build 15063.11 was released for PCs in the Fast and Slow rings on Thursday, while the Release Preview ring got its first taste of build 15063 for PCs on the same day too. Windows 10 Mobile build 15063.2 was released to the Insider Fast ring on Wednesday, quickly followed by the Slow ring. By the way, Microsoft revealed that there are now over ten million Windows Insiders around the world. It had previously stated there were seven million Insiders back in September 2015. Now, here's something that raised a few eyebrows this week. A listing was spotted on the Microsoft Mexico website for an unannounced device called the 'Lumia 651' - identical in appearance to the Lumia 650, but with a larger display. Adding to the mystery, several days after it was widely reported around the world, the product listing remains on Microsoft's site. In the UK, HP seems to have completely lost the plot when it comes to pricing its Elite x3 Windows 10 Mobile flagship. The company has increased and decreased its price by up to 12% seven times since December, with no apparent logic behind its decisions. In the US, HP is now offering almost $200 off a bundle that includes the Elite x3, Desk Dock, Wireless Charger, and more. Remember WhartonBrooks? Back in August, it announced that it was planning to launch a new Windows 10 Mobile device in the autumn, promising that it would be "the most disruptive since the advent of the smartphone in 2000". It added that it would bring "new products and services that will radically change the mobile computing industry". But in September, it postponed an event it was due to hold at a Microsoft Store, saying that it needed to "align schedules" with all the partners who wanted to join in. That event was never rescheduled. In October, it said that its handset had been delayed due to "regulatory hurdles". On Friday, WhartonBrooks finally revealed its new device, the Cerulean Moment. To say it doesn't live up to the incredible hype and the lofty promises that the company made is a huge understatement. The Moment has specs that are comparable - and inferior in some ways - to the HTC One A9, which was unveiled in October 2015, including a Snapdragon 617 processor, and a 720p display. According to Windows Central, the company's earlier claims about disruption and innovation referred not to the handset itself, but to Windows 10 Mobile's PC-like Continuum feature, which has been available on other premium Windows phones since 2015. And to top it all off, WhartonBrooks is relying on a crowdfunding campaign, aiming to raise $1.1 million for the handset's planned launch in August, by which time its specs will be almost two years behind the industry's best, even for a mid-range $299 device. Moving on... Ride-sharing service Lyft - an alternative to Uber in many cities - launched its app for phones and PCs in the Windows Store. Telegram updated its app for Windows phones with an overhauled interface, and some new features too. However, on March 31, Facebook ended support for its main app on all Windows Phones, as well as for Windows 8 and 8.1 PCs. The Messenger app on Windows Phone 8 and 8.1 is also no longer supported. And in more unwelcome news, Zendesk will remove its Windows phone app from the Windows Store next week, having already ended support for it. The company said that Windows phones accounted for "a fraction of a percent" of those who use its services. The latest update to Microsoft's Groove Music app is now available for Insiders in the Fast ring, and includes hints of the upcoming 'Project Neon' design refresh for Windows 10. A new Office Insider Preview made its way to Windows desktop users this week, bringing various improvements. Microsoft also released a new Office Insider build for iOS, adding some handy new features. You can find out about this month's improvements to Office 365 here too. Microsoft opened registrations for its Ignite 2017 conference, which will be held in Orlando, Florida, from September 25 to 29. Microsoft's President and Chief Legal Officer, Brad Smith, said in an interview that the company "will not help any government hack or attack any customer anywhere". His comments came as pressure intensifies on tech companies to do more to help governments deal with terror threats, in the wake of last month's attack in London in which four people, including a police officer, were killed. The company later defended its position after an ugly, and somewhat misleading, article was published by The Sun newspaper, accusing Microsoft of "refusing the [British] Home Secretary's demand for more help on terror". Microsoft said that it had responded in under 30 minutes to a request from UK authorities for email information to aid in their investigation of the attack, and had "provided the information that was sought". While Microsoft prepares for the release of its Windows 10 Creators Update - also known as Version 1703 - for PCs and phones this month, it has already begun its rollout for the Xbox One and Xbox One S. The update includes an updated user interface, integrated Beam game streaming, and many other new features and improvements. Meanwhile, Microsoft is already working on a further Version 1704 update for its Xbox consoles, with the same primary build number as the Creators Update. Build 15063.2009 was released for Xbox Insiders in the Alpha ring on Friday, while build 15063.2006 made its way to the Beta ring. Those in the Beta ring also got their first chance to try out the new Xbox Game Pass. Launching this spring, it will provide access to over 100 games for $10 a month. Far Cry 3 became the latest Xbox 360 game to join the list of those playable on the Xbox One, through the Backward Compatibility program. Ryse: Son of Rome and Darksiders are now available free to Xbox Live Gold subscribers under the Games with Gold program. Cities: Skylines Xbox One Edition was announced in February, and it's now confirmed to be launching on Microsoft's consoles on April 21. The first developer units of Microsoft's upcoming Project Scorpio console are already out in the wild, but it seems they're not yet operating at their maximum potential. That's apparently deliberate, as Microsoft is gradually ramping up their performance, with the aim of allowing developers to run the console at full-throttle by June. When the console is officially unveiled, Microsoft will showcase its performance with games such as Forza 7, Red Dead Redemption 2 and a new Call of Duty title, among others. The next game in the much-loved Call of Duty series is expected to return to its roots, set in World War II. Another greatly anticipated game is Destiny 2, which now has its first official trailer, along with a release date and details of pre-order options. Telltale Games announced details of the first episode of its new game, Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy. And Microsoft announced its new Minecraft 1.1 update for the Windows 10 and Pocket editions, also known as The Discovery Update. Sony released an update for its PlayStation 4 Pro console, bringing support for playing 4K videos stored in mp4 format on a USB stick or home server, through its Media Player app. And Twitch updated its game-streaming service with support for 1080p streaming at 60 frames per second. But our odyssey across the tech world ends this week on a delicious note in Europe, where Domino's Pizza announced that it will start deliveries using autonomous 'Starship Robots'. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got a New Yorker on the way with some Strippers on the side. Story of my life. Bonus content Before we wrap things up for another week, let me first highlight a few extra bits around the site that I hope you’ll enjoy reading. Rich Woods put the new Logitech BRIO webcam through its paces - and he certainly didn't regret doing so. In fact, he declared it "the best webcam you can buy". Be sure to check out his detailed review. Rich also shared his first impressions of the new LG G6 along with an unboxing video of the stylish new Android flagship. And finally, if you're curious to see some of the new features in the next major version of Google's ubiquitous OS, take a look at Rich's hands-on video with the Android O Developer Preview. Stay tuned to Neowin in the days ahead for what’s sure to be another exciting week, filled with official news, lots of updates, and plenty of insights from around the world of technology. For now, though, there’s lots more to read across the site – including all sorts of interesting discussions over on our forums. From all of us on the Neowin team, have a great weekend!

Itâ€™s basically a thumb glove that lights up which the wearer uses to â€˜thumpâ€™ a ride instead of hailing a Lyft ride on their phone. The gag site will be on Lyftâ€™s website on April 1, 2017, April Foolâ€™s Day. Show Caption of Expand By Tatiana Sanchez | tsanchez@bayareanewsgroup.com | PUBLISHED: April 1, 2017 at 9:19 am | UPDATED: April 1, 2017 at 7:31 pm Ms. Pac Man, gnomes and pink bodysuits. Oh my! It’s April Fools’ Day and tech companies in the Bay Area and beyond want to get you started off on the right foot with some wacky hijinks. The wide range of pranks, faux products and spoofs — many mocking Silicon Valley’s tech-obsessed culture — are part of a long tradition that gives businesses ranging from small startups to global corporate giants a chance to show off their senses of humor. Related Articles What are the best April Fools’ Day pranks for 2017? Cats ordering sushi with Amazon’s Echo? Car horn emojis? Silicon Valley gets its April Fools’ on Silicon Valley ignores April Fools’ Day — April Fools! April Fools’ Day: Memorable pranks in Silicon Valley If you’ve ever dreamed of taking a trip back to the ’80s to enjoy a game of Pac Man, today’s your lucky day. Google launched a Pac Man feature on Google Maps Friday that lets users help Ms. Pac Man gobble up dots through a maze, while avoiding the dreaded “monsters” or ghosts. The company followed up hours later with the release of Google Gnome, a smart helper for the yard that can answer burning questions like, “What sound does an opossum make?” It can trim your hedges, turn your garden hose on and off and controls lawnmowers or leaf blowers, according to the company. Oh, and in case you hadn’t guessed, it resembles a garden gnome — red hat and all. So don’t mow that lawn today — have a margarita and let the gnome take care of it instead! Google’s latest trick was released at midnight Friday and this one is for our furry, four-legged friends. The company’s app got a temporary update on iOS that allows for custom in-product searching for dogs and cats. The feature, called “I’m feeling woof and I’m feeling meow,” will generate images that are satisfying to our furry companions — think raw tuna and dog toys. To give this a spin, have your cats and dogs go to “settings” in the Google app on iOS. In its own nod to the beloved pets of the world, Amazon debuted its Petlexa technology, which lets virtual home assistant Echo communicate with animals. A video for the product showed the device tracking a hamster’s steps as it ran endlessly on a hamster wheel and a cat calling on the device to order sushi. With a few barks, Petlexa can launch an automatic ball thrower. T-Mobile released its first-ever “ONEsie,” a bright pink body suit that is the literal meaning of “unlimited coverage.” The suit tracks all of your body’s movements in real time — think of it as wearing a giant Fitbit — while 4G LTE nanofibers turn you into a walking, talking human Wi-Fi hotspot. You can also charge the suit using motion and body heat. When it’s time to wake up, a built-in alarm literally shakes you awake. The suit is also very fashion-forward, according to T-Mobile. Talk about taking a step into the future. Honda poked fun at people’s obsession with emojis by releasing “Horn Emojis,” a driver-to-driver communication system that lets drivers customize their car horns depending on their mood, with the simple press of an emoji button. The idea became an instant favorite following its release on Saturday. The Las-Vegas based online shoe and clothing shop Zappos has the answer to all your delivery woes: Its new delivery boxes can become invisible with the click of a button, never to be stolen off your porch again. Lyft got things going Thursday, giving fans a sneak peek of  “autonomous ride-hailing” with a new gadget called Mono. When wearing the device, essentially a high-tech glove, users can request a ride without even bothering to pull out their smartphones. “With Mono, we want to make the entire ridesharing process as seamless as possible,” Lyft wrote in a blog post, “whether you’re a bellman who can’t whistle or a mom with her hands full; a nudist who needs a ride.” And since we like to obsessively track our daily activities– our calorie intake, exercise and sleeping habits, just to name a few– why not track our business in the bathroom? Quilted Northern released uSit Saturday, “the world’s first biometric tracking device designed to record everything you do in the bathroom.” The product collects data and analyzes bathroom trips, “including duration, frequency and exertion levels. It enables you to set personal goals, earn badges, share progress on social media, and even compete against friends and family in healthy competitions. It also comes with a custom ergonomic belt that integrates seamlessly into any wardrobe,” a spokeswoman said in a statement. Staff writer Marisa Kendall contributed to this report.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Industry  ⋮  Mobile Google Redesigns UI of Web Sign-In Page, Adds Material Design Elements By Zara Ali Mar 31, 2017 11Shares Share Tweet Submit Google has been on an update spree for its mobile interface for various apps, especially the sign-in page on devices. The new interface features material design providing cleaner outlook overall. All these changes have been limited to mobile devices, but now it looks like the search engine giant is extending the same treatment for its web interface as well. Few users have been reporting about a new sign-in design for web pages. It means that Google is gearing up for a wider rollout for its new design interface for web sign-in page too. The new design would give a much-needed overhaul to the mundane interface that we have seen for a long time, presenting it with a refreshed UI. Related Android App Revenue To Overtake iOS App Store This Year, Predicts App Annie On Google’s support forum, the tech giant said that it is redesigning the web sign-in page and will soon be updating it globally. The new web sign-in page looks a lot like the mobile sign-in page with the same material elements and design language. The new design of sign-in page on the web is responsive, and it fits according to the screen size. Advertisement Other than design, there won’t be any change in the functionality of the web sign-in page. Users will still have to enter their e-mail and password to get to their accounts. In a report from VentureBeat, Google’s product manager, Rodrigo Paiva, says: Google started showing people a notification about the change at the bottom of the sign-in screen yesterday to prevent users being surprised by the new look. We started using the new look at the operating-system level — through Settings > Accounts > Add Account > Google on Android, and through the Google App on iOS — a few months ago, and the company has been testing it in browsers internally in recent weeks, Paiva said. The company will gradually roll out the change on the web sign-in page. As mentioned above, the tech giant is notifying users about the imminent changes. So, if your sign-in page starts looking more like the one on your mobile phone, then you just got treated to the more material interface. It is worth noting that recently many phishing attacks started using Google-like sign-in page to dupe users. By rolling out a new design page, Google wants to curb such attacks in some way. Related Google Explains Android O Features and Enhancements in ‘What’s New’ Video For the ones who fail to see the new sign-in page then there could be two reasons behind it – either you are using an old version of a browser or you’ve turned off the JavaScript.

All the not funny jokes and pranks coming my way, and pressure of having to come up with something myself? Grumpy old man, you may say (and okay, you might be right). But a few of this year's efforts did put a smile on my face. Google leads the way with different divisions from various countries coming up with some crazy ideas. PacMan mode in Google Maps has been around for a few years now on April Fool's and in 2017 we have Google Assistant telling dad jokes upon your request. Haptic Helpers are here to here to bring you to your senses. Or, rather, to complete the VR/AR experience that's all about sight and sound, but is severely lacking in taste, touch, and smell immersion (could it be for the better?). Google Japan has been inventing half-serious (or a quarter, maybe?) input methods for this day for a few years now and the latest one involves bubble wrap, taking the punched tape of old to the next level. Make sure you watch the old ones too: the party blower from 2015, and the Flick keyboard from 2016. Meanwhile, Google Netherlands has found a way to bring sun to the country that otherwise gets 145 days of rain in a year. And then, there's Google Gnome, Google Home's sidekick for the back yard. Do bear in mind that the dog might render the Gnome inoperable. Pets and smart home assistants - Amazon's got another take. Meet Petlexa. I also cracked a smile at T-Mobile's OneSie, and after a long work week, I could use a can of OnePlus' Dash. Of course, shared with a BFF, the Honor BFF. Happy April Fool's Day, everyone!

Here's a roundup of some of this year's best (or worst) April Fools Day pranks. By Dan Evon Apr 1st, 2017 9 You can’t trust everything you read on the internet, especially on April Fools Day. The annual holiday is the one time of year when it’s practically encouraged to lie on the internet. Here’s a look at some of this year’s best pranks. Were 90 kangaroos released in Wyoming? The Wyoming Migration Initiative fooled many of its Facebook fans today with a convincing photograph (accompanied by fake news article) about a group of kangaroos that were released in the state: The Wyoming Wild Game Department (WWGD) partnering with the Wyoming Migration Initiative (WMI) have released the first of 5 planned batches of 90 Antilopine Kangaroos into the Wyoming outdoors. The original photograph actually showed a mule dear: Were fresh water dolphins released in Finger Lakes? Wyoming wasn’t the only state to get a new species for April Fools Day. The web site for the Finger Lakes region in New York jokingly claimed that fresh water dolphins had been released into the waterway: In what many are calling one of the greatest triumphs of science and conservation in the history of the United States, freshwater dolphins returned this morning to the waters of the Finger Lakes for the first time since 1787. The return of the dolphins comes as the result of an amazing combination of science, technology, passion combined with just a bit of old fashion luck. And while some are excited about the return of the dolphins, others are furious at the way in which it happened, and the many changes in store for residents and tourists alike. Fingerlakes.com dropped several hints about the humorous nature of this claim. For instance, a man named “John Hammond” (character from Jurassic Park) was reportedly the scientists who extracted dolphin DNA from a piece of amber (also a major plot point of Jurassic Park). The web site also used a pretty unconvincing photograph to show these fresh water dolphins: The original image showed a juvenile Murray cod.  Was the internet banned for children under 13? An interesting article was published on The BBC today claiming that the internet was now banned for children under 13: The government’s ban on internet access for under 13 year olds comes into force today. Dubbed ‘The Web Zombie Act 2017’ the legislation has wide support from the general public. The story was only available for a few hours and was eventually replaced with a graphic explaining that it was a joke (the article also ended with a mention of April Fools), but some kids were still a little stressed out by the news. Is George Takei running for office? The former star of Star Trek has never been shy to voice his political opinions on social media. So when his fans encountered this message declaring his intention to run for office, many people believed that it was real: Well, the cat’s out of the bag it seems. Let’s do this! #Takei2018 https://t.co/Wf7qvV1eXj — George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) April 1, 2017 The tweet linked to an official-looking news article about Takei’s efforts to run for congress. A few hours later, however, Takei admitted that he had no intention of running for congress: Does Virgin Atlantic’s new plane the Dreambird 1417 really flap its wings? Richard Branson of Virgin Atlantic unveiled a new plane, the Dreambird 1417, that uses a new technology called “flapology” to mimic the movements of a bird. The airline produced a video After nearly 30 years of offering customers the ultimate long-haul flying experience, Virgin Atlantic and its founder Sir Richard Branson are once again breaking barriers by announcing a world first in aircraft innovation. Almost a decade in the making, Virgin Atlantic has today announced that its world-class engineering team have been secretly working on the design and production of the world’s first-ever aircraft using new patented technology – flapology – to create the world’s first aircraft with flappable wings. One major giveaway (other than the fact that flapology is a made up term) is the plane’s name. Dreambird 1417 (1 April 2017). Marmite announces new product meh-mite? Is marmite to sweet or bitter? To strong or bland? The company apparently got sick and tired of trying to please all of its fans and decided to release a new product that is was “impossible to love or hate.” I’m excited to announce the launch of my newest pal, ‘Meh-Mite’! A blander version of me that’s impossible to love OR hate… pic.twitter.com/hxyftDSUSr — Marmite (@marmite) April 1, 2017 No, mehmite does not exist. Did Google unveil Google Gnome? The Google Home may look good on your kitchen counter, but what if you need a smart speaker for your backyard? Google may have found the solution with the Google Gnome: The smart yard has finally arrived — Meet Google Gnome. IF gnome’s aren’t your thing, Google also displayed several other Home related products on its web site (all of which are fake). Did T-Mobile introduce a smart onesie? Why buy a smartwatch, a fitness tracker, and Google glasses when you can incorporate all of your technology into one fashionable pink onesie? Be fashion forward and cutting edge at the same time in the new #TMobileONEsie. Technology has never felt so cozy. pic.twitter.com/9h7mDAao1Y — T-Mobile📱 (@TMobile) March 31, 2017 Mars insurance from Progressive Are you worried that humans might destroy the earth?

Companies, brands and media outlets are trying to capture your attention today with pranks and stunts ranging from amusing to eye-rolling. Here are a few of the best: Those pranksters in Mountain View announced “Google Gnome.” Google’s latest (fantasy) product, “for the smart yard you never knew you always wanted,” can cut your grass, play Marco Polo with your kids and answer weather-related questions. You can tell Google is based in California because there’s no mention of whether Google Gnome can shovel your sidewalk. (Hint to Google: April Fool’s Day 2018 suggestion!) The Chicago music festival Riot Fest announced a “literally unbelievable” lineup including The Wyld Stallyns, The Oneders and Rex Manning. That’s pretty impressive, considering those musical acts were made up for “Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure,” “That Thing You Do!” and “Empire Records,” respectively. Well played, one might say. If you have an iPhone, ask Siri what’s she’s doing today. The disquietingly even-voiced “digital assistant” is up to some appropriately nerdy hijinks. And in case you missed it, Ely wants people to think they’ll be able to take “Canoebers” this summer.

Starting this Friday, five more wearables are getting updated to the latest version of Android Wear.  Previously, IBTimes reported that the Mountain View giant has decided to delay the rollout of Android Wear 2.0 to more smartwatches after learning of a software bug that’s plaguing the OS. Google then did not give a specific time frame or date as to when the new OS would be releasing to other devices. Interestingly, a day after the announcement, Google is now saying that Android Wear 2.0 is already available to five more smartwatches.  The high-tech timepieces that will be getting the update starting this Friday are the Fossil Q Wander, Fossil Q Marshal, Michael Kors Access, Nixon Mission and the Polar M600. Aside from the five, Google has confirmed that the update has already been made available for the Casio Smart Outdoor Watch WSD-F10, Fossil Q Founder and TAG Heuer Connected. Adding up all of these, Google is already rolling out its new operating system to almost half of the 19 older wearables that have been confirmed to receive the update, as pointed out by Engadget. Given that the latest version of Android Wear is already coming to five more devices, the hold up is unlikely to last that longer. It’s possible that Google would be updating the remaining units out of the said 19 as early as next week.  Google first announced Android Wear 2.0 almost one year ago during its 2016 I/O developers conference. The new smartwatch OS was then expected to release in the fall of last year, but it was delayed to early 2017. On top of the delay, Google has decided to limit the release of the software to select smartwatches, leaving many other older devices out of the equation.  Android WearMore More smartwatches are getting updated to Android Wear 2.0 starting this Friday.

Employing the same Google Assistant technology as its popular Pixel smartphones, Google's voice-activated speaker will read you the news, answer questions and remind you to put the kettle on. The avant-garde bit of kit from Google follows Amazon's launch of the Echo speaker, a voice activated gadget which can play music, read emails and even order an Uber. Home uses Google's smart "Assistant" to control things like light controls and thermostats or music streaming services to carry out scores of tasks. The voice-controlled smart speaker will cost £129 and will be available in a range of colours including white, black, purple, blue and orange. You will be able to buy it from the Google Store as well as Currys and PC World, Argos, Maplin and John Lewis. Design The design is supposedly inspired by wine glasses and candles. It has a sloped top with four coloured LED lights on it - these provide visual feedback. There is a mute button on the back, which you can press to prevent Google from listening to "hot words". The bottom has a speaker grille attached to it. This can be swapped for different coloured shells to suit your personal taste and mood - there will be six options available in different fabrics and metals. Google assistance This tool is like a more intuitive Google search. It allows users to ask questions in a more natural way so you don't have to think about how you word things to get the answer you want. You can also ask follow up questions so it feels a bit more like a natural conversation. The assistance will also let you share information across devices, like phones, tablets and laptops. What's more, you'll be able to link together several Google Home speakers around your house to synchronise them. Everyday tasks The smart speaker will be able help you manage day-to-day tasks like setting alarms, sending you reminders, starting timers and even adding items to your shopping list. Plus, if you have smart devices in your home, you can control your lights and switches from brands including Nest, Philips or Samsung SmartThings. If you have a Chromecast, you can also use voice commands to play Netflix and YouTube on your TV. Find out more here .

By William Watkinson Updated April 1, 2017 17:44 BST Close In a related video Labour's John McDonnell declares tax war on Amazon and Google in 'fair share' warning IBTimes UK Google paid £36.4m ($45.5m) in UK corporation tax in the last financial year despite a turnover of £1bn, say newly published accounts. The internet firm's operations in this country have come under close scrutiny after a £130m deal with the taxman was struck last year covering 10 years of business. Google's accounts say it made £148.8m of pre-tax profits in the UK for the 12 months to the end of June 2016. The contribution is higher than Google have paid in the past, but critics still slammed the amount as "paltry". The Times reported that the firm indicated in the papers that HMRC actually owed them £31.5m in 'corporation tax'. Although the Daily Mail reported that the technology company did not expect to receive a cheque for the rebate, but maybe the amount will be deducted from future tax bills. A spokesman for Google said: "As an international business, we pay the majority of our taxes in our home country, as well as all the taxes due in the UK. "We have recently announced significant new investment in the UK, including new offices in King's Cross for 7,000 staff." It has been reported that a tenth of Google's £71.2bn worldwide revenues (£7bn) come from its UK operations. "Last year we were told that Google had a £130 million tax bill," Jolyon Maugham, QC, a tax barrister, said to The Times. "This year we owe Google £31.5 million. That has to raise questions about how much tax Google is really paying." Google paid £36.4m in UK tax last year Reuters Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Susan Kramer said: "It is appalling that Google are still getting away with paying such a paltry amount of their total revenue back in taxes. "If [ministers] want to stop cutting vital services they need to start picking up what is owed to the British people. The Government seem to be letting big online businesses off the hook." Last year a financial settlement between Google with HMRC was hailed as a victory at the time by then-Chancellor George Osborne. In 2016, the Government deal with Google to settle a decade's worth of tax bills for £130m was labelled as "trivial" by Labour's John McDonnell.

Google always does a great job, from the Pokemon Google Maps overlay to a smart mailbox, but there are a few from other companies worth mentioning. Here's a rundown of all the hillarious (or strange) tech-related April Fools Day jokes from around the web. Google Gnome One of Google's product launches from last year was the Google Home, a $129 smart speaker with Google Assistant. Now the company is teasing the "Google Gnome," an outside version of the Home. You can ask it weather questions, let it control your lawnmower and other tools, and even dress it up in accessories. The Google Gnome has a page on the Google Store, but unfortunately you can't buy it. I really want a rain coat for my Google Home, though. Mrs. Pac-Man in Google Maps For April Fools' 2015, Google added Pac-Man into Google Maps and Ingress. This year, Mrs Pac-Man is invading Google Maps. For regions of the world already on April 1st, a new Mrs. Pac-Man button is visible on the mobile app. You then have to control Mrs. Pac-Man on real-life streets, and of course, outrun the Ghosts. Google's Bubble Wrap Keyboard (English subtitles are available) Google Japan's prank is pretty funny - it's a bubble wrap keyboard. The idea is to pop bubbles on a bubble wrap sheet to form words, then feed the sheet through a reader to send the message. Some of the bubble wrap sheets are even scented. Google Assistant Google has plenty of Easter Eggs in Google Assistant, and as you might expect, there's one for April Fools' Day too. When asked, Assistant will offer advice on how not to get pranked, such as "If something seems too good to be true today, it probably is." Google Wind Google's Netherlands division has its own April Fools' Day gag, named 'Google Wind.' The idea is to use machine learning to control the weather, using Holland's famous windmills. I'll admit, this one is pretty great. Netflix Live Will Arnet has been in plenty of Netflix original content, from BoJack Horseman to A Series of Unfortunate Events. For April Fools' Day, Netflix is proud to share 'Netflix Live', which is nearly an hour of Arnett commentating ordinary events like toasting bread and completing a crossword puzzle. It's actually funnier than it sounds. You can watch the full thing here (a Netflix subscription is required). T-Mobile ONEsie T-Mobile's prank is a onesie, with "full-body coverage" and a built-in 4G LTE hotspot. You can actually buy it for $40, but the real one doesn't have any tech inside it. Hulu Hu With the claim that the human attention span has "dropped to eight seconds," Hulu has released 'Hu.' It's just a library of short clips from existing Hulu content, and you actually need an account to see them. This is probably the lamest April Fools' Day gag in the list - better luck next year, guys. OnePlus Dash drink OnePlus is really proud of its Dash Charge feature, even to the point of enlisting celebrities to talk about it. For April Fools', the company made real Dash Charge energy drinks. You can find our review of the drink here. Lyft Mono For April Fools' Day, Lyft has announced the 'Lyft Mono.' It's a wearable glove, vaguely resembling a Nintendo Power Glove. This gag is actually real, and once you put it on and get the app, sticking out your thumb will hail a Lyft cab. You can sign up to for a chance to get one here. Honor BFF We all need some positive reinforcement every now and then, right? Honor thinks so, and created the Honor BFF. This imaginary phone uses machine learning to periodically give you compliments and motivation. Hopefully it ships with Android 7.1 Nougat. Google Haptic Helpers This is probably my favorite gag so far. In order to create a more realistic virtual reality experience, you can schedule a "haptic helper" to come to your house and help create a more realistic environment. Just watch the video, it's hilarious. Amazon Petlexa Alexa is cool and all, but your furry friends need one too. As the name implies, Petlexa is Alexa for your pets. Contour by SlickWraps Putting a skin on your phone or tablet is too much work. For April Fool's Day, Slickwraps is teasing the 'Countour' - a machine that sprays on device skins. Frankly, I'm not sure if this is actually real or not, but there is a page for it on SlickWrap's store. Nvidia GTX G-Assist How many times have you been playing an online game, only to be interrupted by someone in real life? NVIDIA has made the 'G Assist,' a flash drive that can take over for you if you're busy. It can also help you beat boss battles, and provides periodic reminders to consume energy drinks. More information and a video can be found here. Google's data center on Mars If you have important data, you need a backup. That's why Google announced its first interplanetary data center, named "Ziggy Stardust," on the Google Cloud Platform Blog today. Located in the Gale Crater on Mars, it will store a cache of data from Earth to prevent irrecoverable loss when a planetary disaster strikes. Google hopes to finish the data center by 2018. LineageOS' mascot CyanogenMod's mascot, Cid, was one of the most recognizable icons in the Android community. As the spiritual successor to CyanogenMod, LineageOS has created its own mascot - 'Ink'. The project also announced 'Br0zip,' an artificial intelligence that can port LineageOS to any device in no time at all. Chromebook accessories Even though most Chromebooks can now run Android apps, you still can't use your Chromebook like an Android phone/tablet for all use cases. Until now, that is. Google has announced a Chromebook Groupie Stick (seen above), a Chromebook Cardboard headset, and a Chromebook armband. See the company's blog post for more info. Exynos Yoga Processor Remember when curved phones were a thing? Maybe we'll see more in the coming months, because Samsung has just unveiled the Exynos Yoga Processor - the first flexible mobile SoC. Anyone up for a Galaxy Flex? Carved screen protector Carved is a small Indiana-based phone case company, but now they are working on a wooden screen protector. Why hasn't this been done before? I'll take ten. I'm Feeling Woof/I'm Feeling Meow By force-touching the Google app icon in iOS, you can select "I'm Feeling Woof" or "I'm Feeling Meow." These give your pets access to the stuff they care about - from dog food to balls of yarn. More info can be found on Google's blog post. Waze maps for Mars According to the company's blog, Waze is has begun to map the surface of Mars. Certain members of the Waze community will also be sent to the Red Planet to more accurately map the surface. JerryRigEverything's NoPhone video If you haven't heard about it, the NoPhone is a solid piece of plastic designed to simulate the feeling of a phone in your pocket. I'm not really sure if anyone uses it, but JerryRigEverything is happy to break it just as much as any other phone. Google Translate for Heptapod B Using machine learning, Google Translate can now decrypt messages written in Heptapod B - the language from the film Arrival. On an unrelated note, it looks like someone from Google is still rocking a Nexus 10. See Google's blog post for more info. Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s ASUS has an April Fools gag too - the Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s Veritas Blue Limited Special Edition. I would probably buy this phone. MKBHD's Nokia 3310 review You may have heard about the updated Nokia 3310, but it turns out the original is an amazing smartphone. Okay, maybe not, but the video is pretty funny. Open GApps Femto Do you need to flash the latest Gapps package on your device, but you don't have a stable network connection? Not to worry, the Open GApps Femto package is here to help. It uses the United States HAARP service (which is not real, but just pretend) to download the latest GApps package. You can find more info at the GApps blog.   That concludes our coverage of April Fools' Day in the tech world. Let us know in the comments below which gag you liked the most!

Yeah they actuqally had me going until I compared a whois of kodi.tv vs kickasstorrents.com, a site that actually was seized. The whois data would show that it is not official. Derik Taylor So this is one I find interesting. Could it technically be a criminal offense to falsify a domain seizure? How would that work? mondeca I hope every year that Google will announce something real and awesome on April Fools' Day, like they did with Gmail. Once again, I am disappointed.

Peterson Silva "Frankly, I'm not sure if this is actually real or not" Well then THAT ought to be the best one! Trooper311 Gimme dat gnome yo. abqnm The Google Haptic Helpers was OK, until they applied the "I Voted!" sticker to the guy's shirt. I was laughing and crying at the same time. Corbin Davenport Yep, that had me laughing too. AdrianFDiratama . How about JG I'd actually like to see Google produce the Google Gnome.... All they'd need to do is add a battery (and Qi charging) to a Google Home and stick it in a new Gnome shell... Make sure its IP68 and maybe even MIL-STD-810G certified. It'd be a fun little gadget to put on the picnic table of your next summer back yard get together. Pump out some tunes, order pizza & Ubers for everyone to go home in, etc... Or take out when you work in the garden & don't want to get your phone dirty... Maybe even produce one with an LTE radio (and GPS). Then you could take it out of WiFi range camping. Wake up and find him chilling next to your tent in his little chair "Hey Google, how's today's weather? When does the rafting place open? How far away from the camp site is it?" cdotlawrence Maybe like a more customizable (from a looks standpoint), durable, & usable-on-go version of Home? Google Home Pro/Ultra? Interesting idea, but not sure why you wouldn't do most of the things it would do on your phone. Some specific use cases like you mentioned but beyond those, idk. Guess it'd be a highly functional, portable, durable and customizable speaker? Suicide_Note Ms. Pac-Man in Maps is live for me here in the US, even though it isn't April 1st yet. Daishi No Clarity Speaker??? Artem Russakovskii Why would that be in this post? Urmil Shroff What if we actually get the Mars data center many years from now? Eumelanin Knight I love this day. I just wish everyone kept up the pranks for the entire month like I do. Oddly enough.. I usually have less friends in May than I started with in April. How curious. Not sure why I brought that up.

Tech Apple Science Cars Baselworld 2017 Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     April Fool’s Day Best Pranks Posted: Apr 1 2017, 9:30am CDT | by M. Affan, in News | Also on the Geek Mind   H&M’s Mark Zuckerberg Clothing Line The best Corporate pranks to have taken place on this April Fool’s Day   When it comes to making fools big corporations are not far behind and their customers are not immune When it comes to the 1st of April the entire world has one thing on their mind; pull pranks! Pranks are pulled on people regardless of any barriers. When it comes to pulling a leg big corporations are not behind but they pull some of the best pranks ever. Some of the best pranks by big corporations which have teased their customers are: Don't Miss: Today's Best Deals on Amazon.com Google Google has long been known for its pranks and this year the tech giant delivered by converting its app Google Maps into a functional game of Ms. Pac-Maps. The Ms. Pac-Maps game will be available Google Maps for Android and iOS until the 4th of April. Last year Google pulled an even more elaborate prank with its Cardboard Plastic headset. Currently VR glasses are the tech world’s biggest gears. Google took advantage of this trend and introduced the world’s first actual reality headset and if you read closely you can understand the pun. The simple plastic headset were stated as compatible with ordinary smartphones and touted as waterproof with a 360-degree audio. The clear plastic headset would have made reality even more real. T-Mobile T-Mobile following the example of Google decided to pull a prank based on headsets. The mobile company promised its customers it will release a superb headgear which will allow customers to binge watch their favorite shows and be productive at the same time. Later it was revealed to be a April Fool’s Day prank. H&M Last year another incredibly funny prank was pulled by H&M when they announced a Mark Zuckerberg Clothing Line. On a website H&M logo and Mark Zuckerberg’s face were used to troll the entire world. The prank was even more ironic as Zuckerberg does not wear anything other than basic T-shirt and jeans. The fake collection showed a line-up of blue jeans and seven identical grey T-Shirts. Samsung In the spirit of being mischievous Samsung also decided to troll the world with its smart knife which was called the Galaxy BLADE edge. The tech giant went overboard while describing a smart knife in accordance to the Chef’s Edition special knife. The prank took place back in 2015 when it conceptualized the fake product in a blog post. The prank even went so far as to state the blade of the knife will retract before cutting the skin. As expected the Sci-Fi knife was nothing more than an elaborate hoax. YouTube The Rickrolling prank is probably one of the biggest pranks to go down in the history of pranks and is still alive even today. The prank took place back in 2008 when the video-sharing platform linked all of the featured videos on its homepage to one particular video. And what a video it was; Rick Astley’s classic ‘Never Gonna Give You Up’. No matter from wherever someone logged in to YouTube the 1987 music video played that particular song. The prank is still alive and now known as Rickrolling. Virgin Cola Way back in 1996 Virgin Cola not only pulled a prank on the public but their rival company Pepsi.  Virgin Cola campaigned their metal cans will turn blue when they expire to ensure consumer safety. Virgin Cola warned everyone not to buy blue cans just as Pepsi unveiled its newly designed bright blue can. Hulu Hulu stated it will release a new service called “Hu” a form of abbreviated TV where shows will be cut down to just eight seconds so people can catch up with storyline in a short time. the company even set up several playlists on its own site and YouTube which showed shorten version of shows like Seinfeld, Black Sails, The Mindy Project, Empire etc. This story may contain affiliate links.

See Offers Lifestyle Posted Yesterday at 12:02 PM Updated April 1 increase font size Your guide to this year’s April Fool’s pranks on the internet Because the hoax-filled 'holiday' falls on a Saturday, a number of jokes arrive early. By Abby OhlheiserThe Washington Post Share Comment Read Article The thing that is usually good about April Fool’s Day is that it is just one day. But 2017 has taken even that from us. Because the hoax-filled “holiday” falls on a Saturday this year, a number of this year’s jokes have rolled out early. Some pranks launched on Friday, while others went live even earlier in the week. As we have in years past, The Washington Post is keeping tabs on all the pranks we can find (or, more often, jokes that are pitched to us by brands). We’ve begun our tracking of this hoax wasteland a day early to account for all the stuff that crept into March. Below is our list of all the April Fools’ pranks on the internet this year, broken up into a few categories. Whether you’ve come here to fact check something you read online that seems a bit off, or because you just like to watch the world burn, we hope this list will be helpful over the next couple of days. And may God have mercy on our souls. – Tech and Web: The weather map is just emojis at Dark Sky. DeviantArt is mostly art of biting pears now. Fontbundles.net restyled its entire website in Comic Sans in a rare display of April Fools subtlety. Reddit’s April Fool’s thing is “Place,” which is less of a joke and more of a massive test of Reddit’s ability to cooperate Kik isn’t really copying Snapchat and introducing “storyz” Yo ALSO isn’t introducing a “stories” feature Roku introduced a fake new feature that suggests snacks to pair with what you watch “Hu” isn’t a new Hulu service that shortens TV shows to 8 seconds Lyft’s “mono” wearable for hailing a car is a joke Tinder’s “live date” on Facebook Live is also a joke Doordash isn’t introducing a kids’ app called “M.O.M.” Duolingo isn’t offering an emoji course A “Netflix Live” preview video on the streaming service gives you a full 45 minutes of Will Arnett commenting on extremely boring video clips. Hinge, a relationship app, isn’t launching a “parental controls” feature Master and Dynamic isn’t really selling concrete headphones “Apocalypse Mingle” won’t really match you with a romantic partner based on how well you’d survive the End Times together – Google The Google Maps app can turn into a functional game of Ms. Pac Man (They’ve done a similar prank in the past) Google Netherlands isn’t going to use the country’s windmills and machine learning to control the weather Google Gnome isn’t a creepy, outdoors-only home assistant Google won’t send “Haptic” helpers to your home to simulate smell and touch while you play VR Google isn’t introducing a bubble wrap keyboard in Japan – Politics! D.C. isn’t getting a Joe Biden-themed pop up bar A fitness tracker company isn’t turning Trump’s border wall into a climbing wall George Takei, who has a history of elaborate April Fools’ pranks, is not running for Congress. This one tricked a lot of people — including some entertainment news sites (come onnn) — until he revealed it was a joke several hours later. – Miscellaneous Brands: Thinkgeek (takes a deep breath) isn’t selling a Hot Pocket sleeping bag, a swear jar, a tentacuddle wrap, a Where’s Waldo parody featuring Barb from Stranger Things, a “swim desk”, a full-body snake temporary tattoo (a la “Westworld”, the movie “Shazaam” starring Sinbad (it doesn’t exist), a bike horn of Gondor, or a “YAAS Cat-apult” Lexus doesn’t have a “Lane Valet” that will move other cars out of the way for you. Eau de Chlôrine, a perfume that makes you smell like a swimming pool, isn’t real. Plated isn’t launching a perfume line that makes you smell like food. Coffee-mate didn’t make a coffee-flavored creamer. Auntie Annie’s isn’t launching a rebrand that puts a Snapchat filter on their logo. Women can’t rent a fully-furnished storage unit as a “She Shed” to escape their families. Progressive isn’t selling insurance for people who are moving to Mars. Whopper toothpaste 🙁 You can’t ship yourself to a friend in a “man freight” Jim Beam isn’t going to start selling canned beans “Chugg” isn’t a real energy drink for college kids Kars4Kids isn’t really a service that gives cars to children so they can drive them A doll company isn’t selling Voodoo dolls The viral “Nanodrop” ad with Paris Hilton in it is a Sodastream prank Carrabba’s, the Italian food chain, isn’t selling its pasta sauce as a beauty mask Sorry, FreshDirect isn’t selling “pitless avocados” “Speed of light” USB cable doesn’t actually exist Tripping hasn’t struck a deal with the White House to rent out its rooms while Trump is out of town on the weekends Groupon hasn’t joined the flat earth movement Bush’s beans isn’t selling jelly beans in a can You can’t use an app to destroy all the clutter in your apartment KFC isn’t launching sushi in New Zealand Mike’s Harder isn’t selling a “Keg in a Can” (this is primarily a visual gag) A tool company isn’t launching a baby accessories line Honda horn emoji are fake, but maybe not the worst idea? A car history tracker can’t also check your potential date’s history Toilet paper blinds are fake Snickers isn’t selling Knickers Delta won’t fly you to Mars Virgin Trains isn’t going to start tattooing tickets on their customers’ bodies – Animal jokes Sugarfina isn’t selling dog treats now The “Harambed” isn’t real Turkey Hill didn’t introduce Cowsonly.com, a dating site only for cows Tough Mudder isn’t starting Puppy Mudder, an athletic event for dogs You’ll never actually be able to buy a watch made out of your pet’s fur Amazon’s Alexa can’t understand your pets now Trulia isn’t launching a real estate service for pets Cheapflights isn’t selling “Catflights,” or flights that come with a cat companion Puzzles for pets are fake A digital retailer isn’t selling a DIY goat soap-making kit (that includes a goat) Freshwater dolphins haven’t returned to the Finger Lakes Petcube isn’t selling “bum” covers for your pets The Wildlife Conservation Society isn’t raising money to buy tiny little raincoats for sloths iFixit didn’t release a tool kit for hamsters These rats can’t detect “man flu,” but can actually detect land mines, apparently. A shirt made out of the bodies of cockroaches is fake, and will not give you cockroach-like enhancements You can’t buy cockroach milk either – Fake wearables, “smart” items, and AI jokes: Wayfair isn’t selling a smart sofa. Cargurus isn’t introducing a bot that lets autonomous cars choose their driver. Quilted Northern isn’t launching a wearable to record all your bathroom activity. You can’t buy a holograph-projecting drone to attend meetings for you. Alamo isn’t launching a line of smart, “self-vacationing” rental cars KFC Canada isn’t making a “smart” bucket T-Mobile isn’t selling a “full-body wearable” called “T-Mobile ONEsie” Petco didn’t make a pooper scooper that is powered by a drone A smart hibernation pod isn’t real (and it’s also not a prank that appears to be done by Samsung) An adult toy company isn’t going to start doing drone deliveries – Fake “news” and history The National Museum of American History launched a fake Smells of American History project, but also created an actual research section on historical perfumes because it can’t stop being a museum, even on April Fools Day. Traveling in a straight line through Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas and Louisiana won’t conjure a homicidal elf, and no one ever believed that it would. The World Wildlife Fund has not discovered a polar bear living in the Outer Hebrides in Scotland David Attenborough isn’t going in a different direction for his next documentary Kellyanne Conway isn’t the commencement speaker at the University of Albany this year – Messing with children: “Blorskee” “Tangeteen” and “Speekuzslmn” (pronounced “speak-ew”) are not real words, much to the relief of the students who took this joke spelling test in class. Ikea Singapore angered a bunch of parents by “announcing” that they were replacing their kids’ play area with a bunch of pods, so kids could isolate themselves with their tablets.

It’s April Fool’s Day, which means many tech companies have dreamt up various tricks and pranks for their fans. Google is a prominent April Fool’s prankster and has plenty of gags for you. But it’s hardly the only tech company that’s trying to drum up some attention this year. In our roundup below, you can check out some of the FAKE NEWS out there that you shouldn’t trust. At least, not today. Don't Miss: The 5 hottest Nintendo Switch games you can preorder right now Google Ms. Pac Maps is this year’s April Fool’s trick from the Google Maps team, allowing you to turn any map on iPhone and Android in a huge Pac-Maps game.

Haptic Helpers will take virtual reality to a whole new level, simulating more than 10,000 unique experiences from the comfort of your own home. If you like the idea of using machine learning to control the weather, then you’ll love this innovative concept: Google Gnome does to your yard exactly what Google Home does to your home. But the Gnome has a cool hat. Since we’re talking about the expansion of some of Google’s services, we can’t ignore Waze for Mars. The Sky is clearly no longer the limit with Google. Image Source: Google Waze won’t be the only Google product heading to Mars. The Google Cloud Platform is also heading to the red planet, complete with a data center. Here’s a picture of it: Image Source: Google Google also has one tool that can help you avoid April Fools pranks, as long as you have Google Assistant close by. April Foolproof is the new feature intended to give you tips on how to stay safe today. Image Source: Gadget Hacks Netflix Netflix’s joke is amazing this year. It’s a 24-hour “live” stream of Will Arnett commenting on all sorts of interesting things. Hulu Meanwhile, Hulu is reimagining content by cutting shows to just a few seconds so that they match your attention span. Hu Short Cuts has a bunch of shows available, including Seinfeld, Black Sails, and others: Roku Roku’s SnackSuggest channel will tell you what food to eat with your favorite streaming shows.

Let’s hope we never see them in stores. Reddit Reddit has a mind-boggling project this year called Place. You can color a pixel board by placing just one pixel at a time every five minutes. It’s really something else. Image Source: Reddit iFixit iFixit, the company that dismantles all the hot gadgets out there, is getting ready for the future’s smaller and smaller devices. T-Mobile T-Mobile introduced the ONEsie, a full-body wearable that monitors everything, all the time. The worst thing about it is that you can buy one for $40, sans the fake smarts: TSheets What if you could add 50 more minutes to your day? Would you switch to the New York Minute?

And while we’re all trying to think of our own best pranks, brands from Coca-Cola to Netflix to Amazon to Google have all come up with their own jokes to get us LOL-ing — along with making us scratch our heads and wonder if they actually exist. Find out what they’ve come up with below. Google While you’re using Google maps to figure out where to meet your friend for lunch, the app has a new feature, which can transform the screen into a huge Ms. Pac-Man game.

As many Android users may know, the Google Assistant is a neat piece of software. It’s very similar to Siri from Apple or Amazon’s Alexa. Only much more capable. This artificial intelligence learns from us, and is one of the most advanced things our smartphones can do. Read: Google Pixel XL Review The Assistant first debuted on the new Google Pixel and Pixel XL. Then with Google Home, a smart connected speaker that can control your home. It has a lot to offer, like always-listening modes ready to take commands, built-in games, and can answer questions or turn on your lights. The options are almost endless, and more are being added every day. The video below confirms the Google Assistant release date. After the initial announcement last week, Google is right on time with the release date. Stating it would be available “soon” and now confirming the broad rollout. Expect updates on the Google Play Store starting March 2nd for all Android devices running Android 6.0 Marshmallow and above. The fact that it can understand context, and answer questions in a string of voice commands without forgetting the original question, sets it apart from the competition. This is one of many key features that users can be excited about starting March 2nd. Ask Apple’s Siri about a movie, then ask another question and it forgets about the movie and starts over. With the Google Assistant, it stays in touch with the original topic. Not to mention a slew of other controls, features, jokes, and more. It’s like a virtual friend you can talk to, ask questions, get directions, or control your entire home and all smart connected accessories. Amazon’s Alexa is starting to be released in a slew of different products. The company is pushing it extremely hard. So much in fact, that this is likely a reactionary move by Google, making Assistant available for all devices. Competition is a good thing, and consumers will soon benefit from it. Google Assistant For All Androids The search giant knows that everyone needs a little helping hand sometimes, and what better way to do this than on our smartphones. The Assistant is currently limited to the Google Pixel and Pixel XL, but almost every new or updated Android will have it within the next week. Starting March 2nd, any smartphone running on Android 6.0 Marshmallow or Android 7.0 Nougat can use the Google Assistant. That means the Galaxy S7, HTC 10, Nexus 6P, or even older devices like the Galaxy Note 5 or LG G5. Specifically, Google stated the Assistant would arrive, “this week to English users in the U.S., followed by English in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom, as well as German speakers in Germany.” So while it won’t be available for literally every Android smartphone, not yet, it’s starting to rollout to millions of users. Above we see it on the Galaxy S7, LG V20 and an HTC phone, and more will get it soon enough. This first week of availability will be limited to the US, with other rollouts being announced in the near future. According to Google users will receive an update to the Google Search application on the Play Store, not to mention behind the scenes with the Google Play Services application and framework. We’d recommend heading to the Google Play Store today, and checking for updates. Then simply press and hold the virtual or physical “home button” down, and the Assistant will spring to life. Agree to the terms, and enjoy all of its features. Try asking the Assistant “I’m Feeling Lucky” and enjoy the game-show built in. It’s one of my household’s favorite features, and now everyone will be able to enjoy it. Again, we can expect more languages and regions to get this feature in the coming weeks or months. For now though, it’s only in the US for English users. Stay tuned for more details, and be on the lookout for the update on your phone. 3 Responses 02/26/2017 John Reply My LG smartphone running Android 5.0.2 is running Allo, which contains Google Assistant. I guess the fact the phone will run Assistant via Allo means my smartphone can run Google Assistant. So, why isn’t Google making Google Assistant available for my phone? 03/03/2017 Crhsitain Weehlan Reply Hi john, this is Crhsitain Weehlan. Try turning it off and on again, it works on mine #4moreyears lol 04/01/2017 Jake @ Google Assitant Reply Google assistant is amazing compared to siri i love this virtual app thank you Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

This game was threatening to turn into a real stinker, but the last quarter was pretty entertaining. Bournemouth have never won at Southampton, but they should have today. They were gifted the softest of penalties, but Harry Arter slipped, kicked the ball with both feet, and sent it high into the stand. It was the second half of his ersatz David Beckham tribute act, and in that sense the more successful part: earlier on, he tried to score from the halfway line. Saints remain the top dogs in the south, then, but both teams are comfortable enough in mid table. Last word to Julian Le Saux: “I bet you thought nobody was reading your commentary.

Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Skip links Skip to primary navigation Skip to content Skip to primary sidebar Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Android Users to Overtake iOS Users in Apps Spending in 2017: Report Haamiz Ahmed 3 days ago Android has finally managed to catch up to iOS when it comes to their users spending money on apps. At least according to a forecast by App Annie. According to a report released by App Annie, Google Play Store combined with 3rd party Android stores will top Apple’s App Store in 2017 in terms of consumer spending. China is The Main Culprit As for how Google managed to surpass Apple, the main reason for that is China, especially because of how Chinese third party Android app stores are a major point of competition in the country. Smartphone manufacturers like Huawei and Xiaomi as well as companies like Tencent and Baidu offer their own custom-flavored app stores for Android apps. Danielle Levitas, App Annie’s senior vice president of research, says, What a lot of people don’t realize is how huge China is. Even if device sales slow, it’s the biggest smartphone channel, and that’s not going to change. Statistics and Predictions In 2016, third party Android app stores made $10 billion. That number is expected to rise to $36 billion in 2021, according to App Annie. This year app spending via third party stores is predicted to double which will help Google surpass Apple in 2017. Total app spending is expected to stand at $41 billion this year just a tiny bit higher than Apple’s $40 billion. Last year Android app spending was $27 billion in total (including third party stores), with Apple leading at $34 billion. 5 Year Prediction Going 5 years into the future, in 2021 the total app spending is expected to be $139.1 billion with Apple contributing $60 billion to the total amount. Android stores will have a $79.1 billion share. App Annie’s Data App Annie provides analytics and market intelligence for app developers. Their reports are cited by industry leaders across the world. The forecast in the above report used data from major publishers economic conditions, conversations with stakeholders and past performance according to Ms. Danielle.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR No one buys Windows phones, so Microsoft has its own version of the Galaxy S8 Chris Smith @chris_writes March 30th, 2017 at 10:12 PM Share Tweet Microsoft might not be getting anywhere at all in the smartphone business when it comes to hardware, but the company’s software is all over Android and iOS. The company also has several patent licensing deals in place with Android vendors that have brought in a ton of cash over the years. With all that in mind, it shouldn’t be too surprising to see a Microsoft-branded Galaxy S8 that just became available for preorder today, no matter how crazy it seems. Don't Miss: Amazon’s 12 best deals: 256GB microSD card, Apple Watch case, Roku Premiere+, QHD ultrabook, more It was one thing for Samsung to partner with Google a few years ago to sell a “Google Edition” version of the Galaxy S4. That was a sort of Nexus-like device sold directly by Google to Galaxy S fans who wanted a bloatware-free Android experience. Those days are long gone, unfortunately. Now, Microsoft is taking preorders for the Galaxy S8 Microsoft Edition and the Galaxy S8+ Microsoft Edition. Microsoft is putting even more software on these special versions of the Galaxy S8 and S8+ that will be sold directly in its retail stores across America. However, you can’t preorder them online from Microsoft’s online store. “A Microsoft customization is applied to the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ Microsoft Edition when the devices are unboxed and connected to Wi-Fi,” a Microsoft spokesperson told The Verge. “This customization ensures customers a best-in-class productivity experience with Microsoft applications such as Office, OneDrive, Cortana, Outlook and more.” It sounds like the special edition phones are regular devices that will get a Microsoft bloatware package when you first connect them to Wi-Fi. Considering that many people use and appreciate Microsoft’s productivity suite, that’s totally fine. And you probably can uninstall any of the extra bloatware if you don’t need it. What’s interesting is that Office, OneDrive, and Skype all come preinstalled on the regular Galaxy S8 handsets, just like they did with the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S6. It’s likely a result of a deal between the two companies following a patent fight a few years ago. But the Microsoft Edition also includes Outlook and Cortana. And yes, that means you’ll have three virtual assistants on the phone: Samsung’s Bixby, Google’s Assistant, and Microsoft’s Cortana. It’s unclear how much the special edition phone costs, and whether it will be available unlocked. However, you’d probably have to be a hardcore Microsoft and Samsung fan to go for this Galaxy S8 option, especially if you have to pay full sticker price to get it.

Improved Google+ notifications appear to be rolling out to all Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2016/10/17 10:30pm PDTOct 17, 2016 111 Plus 1 on G+ 36 Share on Facebook 71 Share on Twitter Total Shares218 Applications Google News Some months ago, Google looked to be rolling out a new interface for notifications in the Google+ app. No sooner did we report on it than Google removed the new notifications with a server-side switch. Google giveth, and Google taketh away. Today, Google giveth. The new G+ notifications appear to be rolling out for real. So, what will you see in the new Google+ notifications? Only what you want, which is rather the point. There are now filters accessible at the top that allow you to see only unread notifications, all notifications, or other updates (things like new followers and collection updates). This should make it easier to triage all those G+ notifications you're getting. The other tweak has to do with dismissing unread notifications. When Google originally went to the new notification screen, you could only dismiss notifications by swiping right to left. Now you can swipe either way. It's possible you've had these features for a while—some people seem to have been on the new version for months. For the rest of us, it seems to have switched over very recently. You should see the changes if you go to your G+ notifications right now, no app update needed. Download: Google+ (Play Store) Tags app updates apps Google subscribe ...

TheOriginalLuffy Great. Now rollout an update that fixes the unbearable choppy scrolling and general lag the last update created. Total Insecurity Yes, please! Lawrence ZzzzZzz nobody outside Google uses it. Artem Russakovskii Wrong. Marc_Razia I love the fact that after 5 years some people still feel the need to post that they don't use G+ and insist that no one else does either. Its like they just want to illustrate their personal angst about the fact that G+ is still around. For whatever reason some folks are so emotionally against the idea of G+ even existing that they can't seem to cope with the fact that others do use and enjoy the service. Lawrence Nobody uses it. Watch any ad on TV or Radio or Web. They always say Follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Yes Instagram made it to the list, sometimes even snapchat. Marc_Razia Right, so its not getting media coverage. But rather than determine whether its being used by what I see on TV, i actually use it, and get more activity on G+ than I do on twitter. I have no idea how it compares in terms of total activity, but there are many communities with over a million members on there and the posts flow at a steady rate. That's not no one. So you can insist no one uses it, you're just wrong. Jamie Brahm ....Instagram or twitter..... Googles full suite, is clearly way more popular than those other two. Google and FB are the standard authentications. Google+ is very popular with technical and academic communities. There you'll find all sorts of high brow quite polite discussion of science, technology and so on versus say, pictures of babies, flame wars and memes. Basically google+ is where the smart people go. ekerazha Please decouple it from any other Google service, so I can finally delete my useless G+ account. Artem Russakovskii It's only useless because you aren't using it, but I get it. They've been on a warpath against Google+ to remove it from all services (the Google Play Store being the last casualty, which I'm still bitter about). The goal is to do exactly what you want, and it's pretty much already gone from all apps. Where can you even find it these days? LazarusDark You can delete your G+ right now and not lose anything else. What's stopping you? MittensOnKittens Some teams at Google seem to churn out updates and new features every two weeks (G+, Drive, Inbox, ...) And then some teams who actually have products in need of fast updates don't push out new stuff for months and months (Allo, Duo, iOS Gmail app, Gmail/Calendar website, ...) givitumibeybi we were waiting for this update for 4 years. wait no. we stopped waiting, 3 years ago. Leandro Brandão It was this way for me for ages in iOS app. Peter Must still be rolling out as i don't see this yet Mayoo "Google giveth, and Google taketh away. Today, Google giveth." http://www.videogamesprites.net/ChronoTrigger/Party/Frog/Frog%20-%20Laugh%20(Front).gif Total Insecurity Not for me, though, lel. My Nexus 9 is on the latest update and it doesn't show up for me :( #feelsbadman Mayoo And the award of being totally off topic is given to you sir! ;) Ryan Well, since they uncoupled it from Hangouts and just recently axed the Events section the only reason to have it is the functionality google took out of Latitude and forced you into Google+ for. If google would just put it back where it belongs, in Google Maps, then Google+ could just die like it should have years ago before Google started forcing us to use it. No point in updating it anymore since you are removing features. Artem Russakovskii And why do you want it to die so badly? If you're not using it, but many others are, what's it to you? Bikram Agarwal ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Seriously. People just love to join "Product X bashing bandwagon". As if that's a cool thing to do. For me, G+ dev / app communities are the best way to get dev / user support. Marc_Razia For whatever reason, even after 5 years of existence, some people still feel the need to point out that they don't use G+ and insist that no one else does either. Its like they just want to illustrate their personal angst about the fact that G+ is still around. Some folks are so emotionally against the idea of G+ even existing that they can't seem to cope with the fact that others do use and enjoy the service. Ryan Because Google is wasting effort on this sideshow when they could be building something much better. Its one of my biggest beefs with Google, they spend so much time on 40 different iterations that never matter when they could be focused and develop one that does. Its going to fail because they are too late in the game to be able to force anyone but die hards to use it and its too disjointed to actually appeal to anyone else. I know people will say "Yeah but THIS TIME." Yeah, this time Google is going to take it seriously, Im sure. Just like all of the other times they took it seriously. Their track record in this space speaks for itself. Might as well just get it over with. Lee Wilson I cant believe they still havent killed this yet..... Artem Russakovskii Google+ is a very active and popular community, if you use it right (i.e. invest more than 3 minutes into it to follow some accounts). Tr3ple Google have to be the smartest dumbest company ever. Soundjudgment People actually use Google+ accounts?? Artem Russakovskii Imagine that. Marc_Razia Wow, so funny...like 4 years ago. Time for some new material : ) Soundjudgment Google+ was relevant over 4 years ago, too! Oh... wait... no it wasn't! ;) Grey See those group notification icons? Four circles? Can we discuss how a recent Hangouts update removed the group notification icon for a generic blank icon? Can we? Google's contact photos don't work right in apps like Hangouts and Gmail. I'd like some attention on this matter and the issue brought to Google as I'd like answers. Removing group icons from Hangouts mystifies me, but what mystifies me even more is no one reporting on it. Jamie Brahm I seem to have updated notifications now, and they are not working properly in edge, or in the google app. They've broken it. Jamie Brahm For all you anti-g+ complainers -- > https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykosner/2013/01/26/watch-out-facebook-with-google-at-2-and-youtube-at-3-google-inc-could-catch-up/#5bd23c633897 Google+ is now number 2 for user engagement. 343 million active users. Stuck in the past much? Joseph Heston I do not like the new notification format whatsoever. I have to manually delete a read notification, and I don't get all the unread notifications (especially the early notifications). The one thing G+ had over FB was their notification format. Now they srewed that as well. I want the old format back (as well as the Hangouts). Puneet Bangera I do not like this new update it was better the way it was previous I wouldn't call it a improvement.. It just looks good but functionality is zero. I was able to use my keyboard to browse through all my notifications Anyone has any idea or work around for this? Writer B.L. Alley I preferred the old system, where the little bell on every Google service page let me know I had a notification and I could read and reply in a sidebar right there. Now, if I want to know when I have a YouTube reply, I have to go to Google Plus to see it, which makes no sense. I wish they would stop 'fixing' things they finally get right and focus on the apps that still don't work.

Google always does a great job, from the Pokemon Google Maps overlay to a smart mailbox, but there are a few from other companies worth mentioning. Here's a rundown of all the hillarious (or strange) tech-related April Fools Day jokes from around the web. Google Gnome One of Google's product launches from last year was the Google Home, a $129 smart speaker with Google Assistant. Now the company is teasing the "Google Gnome," an outside version of the Home. You can ask it weather questions, let it control your lawnmower and other tools, and even dress it up in accessories. The Google Gnome has a page on the Google Store, but unfortunately you can't buy it. I really want a rain coat for my Google Home, though. Mrs. Pac-Man in Google Maps For April Fools' 2015, Google added Pac-Man into Google Maps and Ingress. This year, Mrs Pac-Man is invading Google Maps. For regions of the world already on April 1st, a new Mrs. Pac-Man button is visible on the mobile app. You then have to control Mrs. Pac-Man on real-life streets, and of course, outrun the Ghosts. Google's Bubble Wrap Keyboard (English subtitles are available) Google Japan's prank is pretty funny - it's a bubble wrap keyboard. The idea is to pop bubbles on a bubble wrap sheet to form words, then feed the sheet through a reader to send the message. Some of the bubble wrap sheets are even scented. Google Assistant Google has plenty of Easter Eggs in Google Assistant, and as you might expect, there's one for April Fools' Day too. When asked, Assistant will offer advice on how not to get pranked, such as "If something seems too good to be true today, it probably is." Google Wind Google's Netherlands division has its own April Fools' Day gag, named 'Google Wind.' The idea is to use machine learning to control the weather, using Holland's famous windmills. I'll admit, this one is pretty great. Netflix Live Will Arnet has been in plenty of Netflix original content, from BoJack Horseman to A Series of Unfortunate Events. For April Fools' Day, Netflix is proud to share 'Netflix Live', which is nearly an hour of Arnett commentating ordinary events like toasting bread and completing a crossword puzzle. It's actually funnier than it sounds. You can watch the full thing here (a Netflix subscription is required). T-Mobile ONEsie T-Mobile's prank is a onesie, with "full-body coverage" and a built-in 4G LTE hotspot. You can actually buy it for $40, but the real one doesn't have any tech inside it. Hulu Hu With the claim that the human attention span has "dropped to eight seconds," Hulu has released 'Hu.' It's just a library of short clips from existing Hulu content, and you actually need an account to see them. This is probably the lamest April Fools' Day gag in the list - better luck next year, guys. OnePlus Dash drink OnePlus is really proud of its Dash Charge feature, even to the point of enlisting celebrities to talk about it. For April Fools', the company made real Dash Charge energy drinks. You can find our review of the drink here. Lyft Mono For April Fools' Day, Lyft has announced the 'Lyft Mono.' It's a wearable glove, vaguely resembling a Nintendo Power Glove. This gag is actually real, and once you put it on and get the app, sticking out your thumb will hail a Lyft cab. You can sign up to for a chance to get one here. Honor BFF We all need some positive reinforcement every now and then, right? Honor thinks so, and created the Honor BFF. This imaginary phone uses machine learning to periodically give you compliments and motivation. Hopefully it ships with Android 7.1 Nougat. Google Haptic Helpers This is probably my favorite gag so far. In order to create a more realistic virtual reality experience, you can schedule a "haptic helper" to come to your house and help create a more realistic environment. Just watch the video, it's hilarious. Amazon Petlexa Alexa is cool and all, but your furry friends need one too. As the name implies, Petlexa is Alexa for your pets. Contour by SlickWraps Putting a skin on your phone or tablet is too much work. For April Fool's Day, Slickwraps is teasing the 'Countour' - a machine that sprays on device skins. Frankly, I'm not sure if this is actually real or not, but there is a page for it on SlickWrap's store. Nvidia GTX G-Assist How many times have you been playing an online game, only to be interrupted by someone in real life? NVIDIA has made the 'G Assist,' a flash drive that can take over for you if you're busy. It can also help you beat boss battles, and provides periodic reminders to consume energy drinks. More information and a video can be found here. Google's data center on Mars If you have important data, you need a backup. That's why Google announced its first interplanetary data center, named "Ziggy Stardust," on the Google Cloud Platform Blog today. Located in the Gale Crater on Mars, it will store a cache of data from Earth to prevent irrecoverable loss when a planetary disaster strikes. Google hopes to finish the data center by 2018. LineageOS' mascot CyanogenMod's mascot, Cid, was one of the most recognizable icons in the Android community. As the spiritual successor to CyanogenMod, LineageOS has created its own mascot - 'Ink'. The project also announced 'Br0zip,' an artificial intelligence that can port LineageOS to any device in no time at all. Chromebook accessories Even though most Chromebooks can now run Android apps, you still can't use your Chromebook like an Android phone/tablet for all use cases. Until now, that is. Google has announced a Chromebook Groupie Stick (seen above), a Chromebook Cardboard headset, and a Chromebook armband. See the company's blog post for more info. Exynos Yoga Processor Remember when curved phones were a thing? Maybe we'll see more in the coming months, because Samsung has just unveiled the Exynos Yoga Processor - the first flexible mobile SoC. Anyone up for a Galaxy Flex?

All they'd need to do is add a battery (and Qi charging) to a Google Home and stick it in a new Gnome shell... Make sure its IP68 and maybe even MIL-STD-810G certified. It'd be a fun little gadget to put on the picnic table of your next summer back yard get together. Pump out some tunes, order pizza & Ubers for everyone to go home in, etc... Or take out when you work in the garden & don't want to get your phone dirty... Maybe even produce one with an LTE radio (and GPS). Then you could take it out of WiFi range camping.

Technology giant Google, which has pranked consumers for years with some quirky product teasers ahead of April 1, this time showcased 'Google Gnome' -- a smart speaker for outdoors. Similar to Google Home, Google's smart speaker for indoors, Gnome was also to tell the wind speed and also take control of yard tools like tiller and water hose. It was only at the end of Google Gnome's page that the company said, "Google Gnomes are real, but only in our hearts- for now. Happy April Fools'!" Google was quicker to tell the unsuspecting consumers about the prank, while Ola and Xiaomi decided to play it along a little more by deciding to reveal later about the teasers of their so-called new products being just pranks. Ola released a video interview of its co-founder and CEO Bhavish Aggarwal to announce that it was launching 'Ola Wheels' -- designed for ultra-short commute inside corporate parks and equipped with voice-based artificial intelligence. The cab aggregator went on to announce that it was hiring voice artists for the product and was looking for people with "soulful voice". Xiaomi also roped in its CEO Lei Jun for a video teaser for its new 'smart motorcycle'. The video showed Jun addressing Mi fans in India, where in he said, "We have created a very special product for our Indian Mi fans, the Mi Smart Motorcycle. "Like our devices, it is of very high quality and at a great price. It is launching very soon." The video was shared multiple times from the account of Xiaomi India Head Manu Jain's Facebook account. On Xiaomi India's official Twitter account, the video got several likes and retweets. The campaigns by Ola and Xiaomi drew varied reactions from netizens across the country. While many were quick to call them probable April Fools' Day pranks, there were others who wanted to know the launch dates and other details of the promised products. The Gnome advertisement on Google's official Twitter account also saw several likes and retweets. Audio company Master & Dynamic also announced a new edition of its signature over-ear headphones that it said were made of solid concrete. Weighing at about five kgs, the headphones are supposed to produce the "same high-end sound quality as its metal and leather counterpart", the company said in a blog post. While the company listed the price as USD 399, it ended the post saying "... April Fools'!"

Samsung was reeling from what was the Note 7 fiasco and had taken its eye off the ball. This piece of bad luck allowed the pixels to become the best (too many) Android handsets available. However, now that the Galaxy S8 has been announced can the smaller Google device hold its own against Samsung’s latest? We’ve taken a look; you can view the details below. Galaxy S8 vs. Google Pixel Before you begin this voyage of discovery, let’s start by quantifying what you’re about to read. To start with the Pixel has been on sale since October 2016, and at that time was the most powerful Android handset available. As for the S8, it won’t go on general sale until next month, instead, if you want to be one of the first, you need to pre-order it. As for what you can expect from it, Samsung has seriously pushed the boat out this year. After all, it has a lot to make up for, as such, you shouldn’t expect the Galaxy S8 just to make up the numbers. Design True to form the Galaxy S8 is a gorgeous looking handset, just like its predecessor. However, this year Samsung has turned up the dial, to include dual-curved edges and an extended display with reduced top, bottom and side bezels. In truth, it is a smartphone made for the design-conscious if your device must look good, cast your eyes no further. Gone is the home button. Instead, it has been embedded into the display, with the fingerprint sensor and an Iris scanner placed on the back. Its build quality is also worth talking about, made from both metal and glass this combination gently comes together. In comparison, last year’s Google Pixel is still a functional looking device. However, back when it was new, Samsung’s S7 Edge beat it in the looks stakes. Having said that, it does come with a metal and glass body and its overall size is comparable to the Galaxy S8’s. However, its functional, yet bland design reminds us of a prototype not a device fighting for the top spot. Display When first looking at each device side-by-side, the first thing you will notice is the difference in displays. Samsung’s has what it calls an Infinity Display and comes with an aspect ratio of 18.5:9. This 5.8-inch Super AMOLED panel is longer and provides improved resolution compared to previous models at 1440 x 2960. Meaning it is capable of producing truly outstanding images, mainly in part to its inbuilt HDR technology. In comparison, the Google Pixel display is smaller at 5-inches and offer a max resolution of 1080p. Now, although this is below what the S8 can provide, its, still no match. Could you notice the difference? Barely, however, we expect the S8’s level of detail is aimed at Virtual Reality headset users. Size and Colors Other than looks and display, one of the most important things to consider when purchasing a handset is its overall size. After all, what you don’t want is a device that is impossible to use in one hand. Here’s how they compare: Coming in at 140.1 x72.2 x 7.3mm and weighing 155-grams the Galaxy S8 is longer, wider, heavier, but thinner than the Google Pixel. Its dimensions are 143.8 x 69.5 x 8.5mm, and it weighs 143-grams, which means there are both positives and negatives. As for the choice of colors, the S8 comes in dark black, bright silver, and gray. While the Google Pixel has the usually named, quite black, very silver, and really blue so both similar in choice. It was said, by those at the S8 reveal, that the dark black Galaxy S8 will be the color of choice. As it is apparently absolutely gorgeous, something which can not be said about the pixel in any color. Power Which of these two smartphones has the most power, and as such the better performance? Starting with the Galaxy S8, it’s packing Qualcomm’s latest chipset the Snapdragon 835. It promises performance increases of up to 35% compared to the previous chipset, that’s for both GPU and CPU. Meaning that the S8 should be a super fast handset, especially when you couple it with a respectable 4GB of RAM. Why only 4GB? We don;t know, however, Samsung is happy with it, which means combined with the chip performance is increased. As for the Google Pixel, back in October, it launched with what was then the best Qualcomm chipset on the market. The Snapdragon 821, and it proved to be a hit, powering that device to perform spectacularly. However, even with its 4GB of RAM, it is still and older chip, which means the S8 and the Snapdragon 835 win. Final Thoughts It’s clear to see from the brief comparison we’ve undertaken, that the S8 is the superior handset. Something which considering the point Samsung has to prove this year to its customers and possibly new ones isn’t surprising. Unlike Apple which has seen falling sales, and rumors of the iPhone 8 leaking. Samsung has a different job to do in 2017, and that is to restore confidence in its brand. Something that isn’t possible to do overnight, it may take the S8, S8 Plus, Galaxy Note 8 and beyond to do that.

Google Updates its iOS Mobile App with Gboard and New Trending Widget Apart from going straight to the Google website, the official app itself is the way to go if you need to get things done in pure Google fashion. Today, things are taking a turn for the better, as Google has announced that it will be bundling the Gboard keyboard app into its main app. Things don’t stop there though. The company is also bundling a brand new Trending on Google widget, allowing you to see in real-time what is trending in the world of Google Search. Related 12 Paid iOS Apps & Games Are Free Today – Download Them All Last May, we launched Gboard, a keyboard for iPhone that allows you to search Google and send information, GIFs, emoji, and more — right from your keyboard. While Gboard first launched as a standalone app, it now comes installed with the Google app. Don’t be stifled by the same old texts and smiley faces; with Gboard, expressing yourself with emoji, multiple languages and GIFs has never been easier or more fun. To access, go to your Google app settings to set up Gboard on your device. For those unaware, Gboard was available as a separate download to those who were looking for a third-party keyboard replacement. Not only it gets the work done, but also assures that search is right at your fingertips. In order to activate Gboard if you have the latest version of the Google app instead, simply head over to Settings > General > Keyboard > Keyboards. The Trending on Google widget, on the other hand, is a great way to see what’s happening in the world of search. Just 3D Touch on the Google app’s icon and you’ll see the widget instantly. Or, if you so wish, you can add it to your Today screen as well, so that it’s accessible whenever you need it to.

See something that catches your eye? Just tap on the trending search to open up the Google app and learn more. To access the widget, use 3D Touch on the app icon or swipe right on your home screen.

Google always does a great job, from the Pokemon Google Maps overlay to a smart mailbox, but there are a few from other companies worth mentioning. Here's a rundown of all the hillarious (or strange) tech-related April Fools Day jokes from around the web. Google Gnome One of Google's product launches from last year was the Google Home, a $129 smart speaker with Google Assistant. Now the company is teasing the "Google Gnome," an outside version of the Home. You can ask it weather questions, let it control your lawnmower and other tools, and even dress it up in accessories. The Google Gnome has a page on the Google Store, but unfortunately you can't buy it. I really want a rain coat for my Google Home, though. Mrs. Pac-Man in Google Maps For April Fools' 2015, Google added Pac-Man into Google Maps and Ingress. This year, Mrs Pac-Man is invading Google Maps. For regions of the world already on April 1st, a new Mrs. Pac-Man button is visible on the mobile app. You then have to control Mrs. Pac-Man on real-life streets, and of course, outrun the Ghosts. Google's Bubble Wrap Keyboard (English subtitles are available) Google Japan's prank is pretty funny - it's a bubble wrap keyboard. The idea is to pop bubbles on a bubble wrap sheet to form words, then feed the sheet through a reader to send the message. Some of the bubble wrap sheets are even scented. Google Assistant Google has plenty of Easter Eggs in Google Assistant, and as you might expect, there's one for April Fools' Day too. When asked, Assistant will offer advice on how not to get pranked, such as "If something seems too good to be true today, it probably is." Google Wind Google's Netherlands division has its own April Fools' Day gag, named 'Google Wind.' The idea is to use machine learning to control the weather, using Holland's famous windmills. I'll admit, this one is pretty great. Netflix Live Will Arnet has been in plenty of Netflix original content, from BoJack Horseman to A Series of Unfortunate Events. For April Fools' Day, Netflix is proud to share 'Netflix Live', which is nearly an hour of Arnett commentating ordinary events like toasting bread and completing a crossword puzzle. It's actually funnier than it sounds. You can watch the full thing here (a Netflix subscription is required). T-Mobile ONEsie T-Mobile's prank is a onesie, with "full-body coverage" and a built-in 4G LTE hotspot. You can actually buy it for $40, but the real one doesn't have any tech inside it. Hulu Hu With the claim that the human attention span has "dropped to eight seconds," Hulu has released 'Hu.' It's just a library of short clips from existing Hulu content, and you actually need an account to see them. This is probably the lamest April Fools' Day gag in the list - better luck next year, guys. OnePlus Dash drink OnePlus is really proud of its Dash Charge feature, even to the point of enlisting celebrities to talk about it. For April Fools', the company made real Dash Charge energy drinks. You can find our review of the drink here. Lyft Mono For April Fools' Day, Lyft has announced the 'Lyft Mono.' It's a wearable glove, vaguely resembling a Nintendo Power Glove. This gag is actually real, and once you put it on and get the app, sticking out your thumb will hail a Lyft cab. You can sign up to for a chance to get one here. Honor BFF We all need some positive reinforcement every now and then, right? Honor thinks so, and created the Honor BFF. This imaginary phone uses machine learning to periodically give you compliments and motivation. Hopefully it ships with Android 7.1 Nougat. Google Haptic Helpers This is probably my favorite gag so far. In order to create a more realistic virtual reality experience, you can schedule a "haptic helper" to come to your house and help create a more realistic environment. Just watch the video, it's hilarious. Amazon Petlexa Alexa is cool and all, but your furry friends need one too. As the name implies, Petlexa is Alexa for your pets. Contour by SlickWraps Putting a skin on your phone or tablet is too much work. For April Fool's Day, Slickwraps is teasing the 'Countour' - a machine that sprays on device skins. Frankly, I'm not sure if this is actually real or not, but there is a page for it on SlickWrap's store. Nvidia GTX G-Assist How many times have you been playing an online game, only to be interrupted by someone in real life? NVIDIA has made the 'G Assist,' a flash drive that can take over for you if you're busy. It can also help you beat boss battles, and provides periodic reminders to consume energy drinks. More information and a video can be found here. Google's data center on Mars If you have important data, you need a backup. That's why Google announced its first interplanetary data center, named "Ziggy Stardust," on the Google Cloud Platform Blog today. Located in the Gale Crater on Mars, it will store a cache of data from Earth to prevent irrecoverable loss when a planetary disaster strikes. Google hopes to finish the data center by 2018. LineageOS' mascot CyanogenMod's mascot, Cid, was one of the most recognizable icons in the Android community. As the spiritual successor to CyanogenMod, LineageOS has created its own mascot - 'Ink'. The project also announced 'Br0zip,' an artificial intelligence that can port LineageOS to any device in no time at all. Chromebook accessories Even though most Chromebooks can now run Android apps, you still can't use your Chromebook like an Android phone/tablet for all use cases. Until now, that is. Google has announced a Chromebook Groupie Stick (seen above), a Chromebook Cardboard headset, and a Chromebook armband. See the company's blog post for more info. Exynos Yoga Processor Remember when curved phones were a thing? Maybe we'll see more in the coming months, because Samsung has just unveiled the Exynos Yoga Processor - the first flexible mobile SoC. Anyone up for a Galaxy Flex? Carved screen protector Carved is a small Indiana-based phone case company, but now they are working on a wooden screen protector. Why hasn't this been done before? I'll take ten. I'm Feeling Woof/I'm Feeling Meow By force-touching the Google app icon in iOS, you can select "I'm Feeling Woof" or "I'm Feeling Meow." These give your pets access to the stuff they care about - from dog food to balls of yarn. More info can be found on Google's blog post. Waze maps for Mars According to the company's blog, Waze is has begun to map the surface of Mars. Certain members of the Waze community will also be sent to the Red Planet to more accurately map the surface. JerryRigEverything's NoPhone video If you haven't heard about it, the NoPhone is a solid piece of plastic designed to simulate the feeling of a phone in your pocket. I'm not really sure if anyone uses it, but JerryRigEverything is happy to break it just as much as any other phone. Google Translate for Heptapod B Using machine learning, Google Translate can now decrypt messages written in Heptapod B - the language from the film Arrival. On an unrelated note, it looks like someone from Google is still rocking a Nexus 10. See Google's blog post for more info. Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s ASUS has an April Fools gag too - the Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s Veritas Blue Limited Special Edition. I would probably buy this phone. MKBHD's Nokia 3310 review You may have heard about the updated Nokia 3310, but it turns out the original is an amazing smartphone. Okay, maybe not, but the video is pretty funny. Open GApps Femto Do you need to flash the latest Gapps package on your device, but you don't have a stable network connection? Not to worry, the Open GApps Femto package is here to help. It uses the United States HAARP service (which is not real, but just pretend) to download the latest GApps package. You can find more info at the GApps blog.   That concludes our coverage of April Fools' Day in the tech world. Let us know in the comments below which gag you liked the most!

All they'd need to do is add a battery (and Qi charging) to a Google Home and stick it in a new Gnome shell... Make sure its IP68 and maybe even MIL-STD-810G certified. It'd be a fun little gadget to put on the picnic table of your next summer back yard get together. Pump out some tunes, order pizza & Ubers for everyone to go home in, etc... Or take out when you work in the garden & don't want to get your phone dirty... Maybe even produce one with an LTE radio (and GPS). Then you could take it out of WiFi range camping. Wake up and find him chilling next to your tent in his little chair "Hey Google, how's today's weather? When does the rafting place open? How far away from the camp site is it?" cdotlawrence Maybe like a more customizable (from a looks standpoint), durable, & usable-on-go version of Home? Google Home Pro/Ultra? Interesting idea, but not sure why you wouldn't do most of the things it would do on your phone. Some specific use cases like you mentioned but beyond those, idk. Guess it'd be a highly functional, portable, durable and customizable speaker? Suicide_Note Ms. Pac-Man in Maps is live for me here in the US, even though it isn't April 1st yet.

By: PTI | New Delhi | Published: April 1, 2017 7:47 PM Social media today went agog over smartphone maker Xiaomi’s plans to launch a smart motorcycle and cab aggregator Ola’s robotic ‘Wheels’ for rides within offices — only if they were not the All Fool’s Day pranks! (IE) Social media today went agog over smartphone maker Xiaomi’s plans to launch a smart motorcycle and cab aggregator Ola’s robotic ‘Wheels’ for rides within offices — only if they were not the All Fool’s Day pranks! Technology giant Google, which has pranked consumers for years with some quirky product teasers ahead of April 1, this time showcased ‘Google Gnome’ — a smart speaker for outdoors. Similar to Google Home, Google’s smart speaker for indoors, Gnome was also to tell the wind speed and also take control of yard tools like tiller and water hose. It was only at the end of Google Gnome’s page that the company said, “Google Gnomes are real, but only in our hearts —- for now. Happy April Fools’!” Google was quicker to tell the unsuspecting consumers about the prank, while Ola and Xiaomi decided to play it along a little more by deciding to reveal later about the teasers of their so-called new products being just pranks. Ola released a video interview of its co-founder and CEO Bhavish Aggarwal to announce that it was launching ‘Ola Wheels’ — designed for ultra-short commute inside corporate parks and equipped with voice-based artificial intelligence. The cab aggregator went on to announce that it it was hiring voice artists for the product and was looking for people with “soulful voice”. You May Also Like To Watch: Xiaomi also roped in its CEO Lei Jun for a video teaser for its new ‘smart motorcycle’. The video showed Jun addressing Mi fans in India, where in he said, “We have created a very special product for our Indian Mi fans, the Mi Smart Motorcycle. “Like our devices, it is of very high quality and at a great price. It is launching very soon.” The video was shared multiple times from the account of Xiaomi India Head Manu Jain’s Facebook account. On Xiaomi India’s official Twitter account, the video got several likes and retweets. The campaigns by Ola and Xiaomi drew varied reactions from netizens across the country. While many were quick to call them probable April Fools’ Day pranks, there were others who wanted to know the launch dates and other details of the promised products. The Gnome advertisement on Google’s official Twitter account also saw several likes and retweets. Audio company Master & Dynamic also announced a new edition of its signature over-ear headphones that it said were made of solid concrete. Weighing at about five kgs, the headphones are supposed to produce the “same high-end sound quality as its metal and leather counterpart”, the company said in a blog post. While the company listed the price as USD 399, it ended the post saying “… April Fools’!”. Please Wait while comments are loading...

The telecom giant has partnered with Evie Launcher to bring a new application called ‘AppFlash‘ — a universal search bar that will come pre-installed on the home screens of all Verizon Android handsets for quickly finding apps and web content.   AppFlash is simply a Google search bar replacement, but instead of collecting and sending telemetry data including what you search, handset, apps and other online activities to Google, it will send to Verizon. What’s worse? Just like other pre-installed bloatware apps, Android users can’t uninstall AppFlash quickly, unless they have rooted their phone. AppFlash allows you to search inside apps or browse through listings of nearby restaurants and entertainment. The built-in Google Search can also do all these stuff. So, there’s nothing this app does that a Google search can’t. Then what’s the need for this app? Of course, selling your data to advertisers or other big data companies and make money — thanks to the US Senate that allowed ISPs to collect and sell your data without permission and banned the FCC from ever passing any rule that would limit these powers. Here’s what the privacy policy of AppFlash reads: We collect information about your device and your use of the AppFlash services. This information includes your mobile number, device identifiers, device type and operating system, and information about the AppFlash features and services you use and your interactions with them. We also access information about the list of apps you have on your device. With your permission, AppFlash also collects information about your device’s precise location from your device operating system as well as contact information you store on your device. AppFlash information may be shared within the Verizon family of companies, including companies like AOL who may use it to help provide more relevant advertising within the AppFlash experiences and in other places, including non-Verizon sites, services, and devices. What’s more? There is a ‘Suggested Apps’ section on the AppFlash main screen, which means that those apps have paid Verizon a good price to list on the main screen. How to Get Rid of ‘AppFlash’ on Your Verizon Android Phone Users can get rid of this bloatware in two ways: you can either root your device and remove the app in question, or only disable the app. 1. Root to remove AppFlash from Android: Since the company has made AppFlash a default app on the home screen of its Android handsets to help users search content and browse the internet, the app can not be uninstalled. So, in order to uninstall AppFlash, you are required to root your Android device and then delete the app from your storage memory. 2. Disable AppFlash without Root: Since rooting is a dangerous process that void your device warranty, you can simply disable AppFlash. Disabling bloatware apps on newer phones is easy, as Android has a built-in way to do this, which doesn’t require any root access. Just head on to Settings → Apps (or ‘Applications’ on some phones) → AppFlash. Now open it and click ‘Disable,’ ‘Force Stop’ and then ‘Clear Data’ as well. http://thehackernews.com/2017/03/verizon-appflash-evie.html?m=1 Share this: Print Email Share on Tumblr Tweet Pocket This entry was posted in News.

Similar to Google Home, Googles smart speaker for indoors, Gnome was also to tell the wind speed and also take control of yard tools like tiller and water hose. It was only at the end of Google Gnomes page that the company said, "Google Gnomes are real, but only in our hearts ?- for now. Happy April Fools!" Google was quicker to tell the unsuspecting consumers about the prank, while Ola and Xiaomi decided to play it along a little more by deciding to reveal later about the teasers of their so-called new products being just pranks. Ola released a video interview of its co-founder and CEO Bhavish Aggarwal to announce that it was launching Ola Wheels -- designed for ultra-short commute inside corporate parks and equipped with voice-based artificial intelligence. The cab aggregator went on to announce that it it was hiring voice artists for the product and was looking for people with "soulful voice". Xiaomi also roped in its CEO Lei Jun for a video teaser for its new smart motorcycle. The video showed Jun addressing Mi fans in India, where in he said, "We have created a very special product for our Indian Mi fans, the Mi Smart Motorcycle. "Like our devices, it is of very high quality and at a great price. It is launching very soon." The video was shared multiple times from the account of Xiaomi India Head Manu Jains Facebook account. On Xiaomi Indias official Twitter account, the video got several likes and retweets. The campaigns by Ola and Xiaomi drew varied reactions from netizens across the country. While many were quick to call them probable April Fools Day pranks, there were others who wanted to know the launch dates and other details of the promised products. The Gnome advertisement on Googles official Twitter account also saw several likes and retweets. Audio company Master & Dynamic also announced a new edition of its signature over-ear headphones that it said were made of solid concrete. Weighing at about five kgs, the headphones are supposed to produce the "same high-end sound quality as its metal and leather counterpart", the company said in a blog post. While the company listed the price as USD 399, it ended the post saying "... April Fools!".

Google, which dominates the searches of India’s 300 million Internet users, says it remains confident it complied with the country’s competition law © AFP/File Damien Meyer Three years after starting its investigation, the Competition Commission of India’s preliminary report said Google favoured its own services when customers ran searches, suggesting breaches of competition law. “The conduct of Google is found to be unfair and discriminatory,” the commission’s 714-page report seen by AFP said. “Google steers users to its own products and services, and produces biased results,” according to the report. The commission, which has received but not publicly released the report, is yet to make a final ruling on the Internet giant. But the regulator, which declined to comment on Tuesday, has the power to impose multi-million dollar fines on companies found guilty of violating competition law. Google said it was reviewing the report and cooperating with the commission’s ongoing investigation. But the company, which dominates searches of India’s 300 million Internet users, said it remained confident it complied with Indian competition law. “Regulators and courts around the world, including in the US, Germany, Taiwan, Egypt and Brazil, have looked into and found no concerns on many of the issues raised in this report,” a Google spokesman said in a statement. The report comes as Google faces an antitrust case in Europe where regulators are investigating allegations it cheated its rivals by distorting Internet search results in favour of its shopping service. Google, which has denied the allegations, faces a billion-euro fine if found at fault under EU antitrust rules. Google has for years been the leader in Internet search and has turned advertising linked to those searches into a highly lucrative business. US regulators concluded in 2013 there was not enough evidence to show the brand manipulated its search results to the detriment of competitors. Complaints in India were lodged against Google in 2012 including by Bharat Matrimony, an online matrimonial site, and the nonprofit consumer protection group Consumer Unity and Trust Society. Society director Udai Mehta said its complaint was aimed at trying to ensure online companies adhere to “competition principles” for the benefit of consumers. “One hopes that they will amend their ways to promote healthy practices after being hammered across the world,” Mehta told AFP.

Image Credit: Michael O'Donnell/VentureBeat Nearly 20 new services have been made available to Google Home users this week, including lots of ways to control smart home devices and the best Bible-reading action to date. (Actions are like voice-only apps for Google Assistant, akin to skills for Alexa and Cortana.) More than 150 actions have been made by third-party developers since the launch of Actions on the Google platform last December. Complete with a narrator, the YouVersion action will read you a Bible verse everyday or make you a Bible reading plan. You can even tell the action things like “I’m feeling sad” or “I’m feeling angry,” and YouVersion will read you scripture that matches your mood or provides support. The YouVersion action comes from Life.Church, creator of the most-downloaded Bible app in App Store and Google Play markets. Last December, Life.Church reported that its Bible app surpassed the 250 million download mark. The YouVersion action can create reading plans based on pretty much whatever you want to do. You can tell it to make you a reading plan based on the Old Testament, New Testament, a specific book in the Bible, or the entire Bible, and you can set the time span. Ask YouVersion about your progress, and it will tell you how you’re doing with your plan. YouVersion is the fourth Bible-reading action available for Google Home — following the release of Today’s Bible Verse, YouVersion Stories, and Faithlife — but YouVersion is by far the best Bible reader available today on Google Home. In other religious services on Google Home, the Divine Song action plays songs from the Hindu scripture Bhagavad Gita. Life.Church is also maker of the YouVersion Stories action for kids and families, and the Verse of the Day Alexa skill, which launched recently and is already in the Top Enabled Skills category of the Alexa Skills Marketplace. Many of the new actions released this week are related to integrations with more than a dozen Internet of Thing devices made available for Google Assistant users Wednesday. Some can be found by going to the Home Control section of the Google Home app, while others are Google Home actions. Smart home actions now available in the Services section of the Google Home app can let you control Frigidaire windowsill air conditioner units and Check In smart home cameras. And there are plenty more: The Harmony action lets you use the Logitech Harmony remote control to play or pause a television, turn to favorite channels, and turn a TV on or off. Onelink has an action that controls First Alert smoke and carbon monoxide detectors. You can manage Rachio smart sprinkler systems with the Rachio action. The August action can lock an August Smart Lock or tell you if a door is locked. And the Ring action can be used to record video from the smart doorbell, turn on motion alert, or find out the last time your doorbell rang. Actions to control a variety of smart home devices have steadily been added to the Google Assistant action ecosystem since its launch. Another key area has been public transportation. The new My Bus Stop action will tell you the schedule of San Francisco MUNI buses and trains. The Bay Transport action is yet another BART train tracker (there are three now) that can tell you when a train is going to be at a station near you. The Agent of the Day action shares a noteworthy Google Home app every day. Seaside Data gives ocean temperature and wave height data for any seaside city in the United States. This data comes from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Seaside Data follows Hawaii Surf Report and Forecaster Joe actions for surfers. Crazy House is an adventure game action that brings you inside “strange rooms with interesting objects.” Each door you open introduces you to a strange man singing “Tambourine Man” or to a room full of maniacs. Earlier this week, the Google Assistant team made a sound effect library available to developers to encourage them to make more Google Home games, so expect to see more actions like The Magic Door or Aeden from Westworld. Other actions launched in recent weeks include beer and wine guides and Chefling, an action that can tell you when groceries are going to expire. Third-party Google Assistant actions made with the Actions on Google platform, API.ai, or other tools are currently only available for Google Home.

Samsung March Security Update Google is rolling out March security updates to its Nexus devices and Samsung is following suit with March security updates of its own. The March security patch isn’t rolling out to any devices yet but we expect that to change in the near future as the company works to deliver the patches in new Marshmallow and Nougat builds. You can get a feel for the changes via the March patch notes on the company’s website. It delivers key patches from Samsung and Google. Android Nougat Update As we’ve noted, the Samsung Galaxy Marshmallow roll out has been joined by Samsung’s new Android 7.0 Nougat update. The company’s official Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge Android Nougat roll outs have begun though the release is limited to select models in select regions around the world. We expect that to change in the near future. Samsung’s promised several Nougat updates in the first half of 2017 and we expect all of these upgrades to deliver new features, tweaks and fixes for lingering Marshmallow issues. Devices like the Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 Edge, and Galaxy Note 5 should be next in line for Samsung’s version of Android Nougat. For more information on the Android Marshmallow’s successor, take a look at our Samsung Galaxy Android Nougat roundup and our Android Nougat walkthrough. Samsung’s Android Nougat update will bump devices from Android 6.0.1 to Android 7.0. It’s not clear when or if Samsung will bump its devices to Android 7.1.1, the most up-t0-date version of Nougat. If you own a Galaxy S7 or Galaxy S7 Edge, we’ve put together a guide that will take you through the most important things to know about your update. If you own a Galaxy S6 or Galaxy Note 5, we’ve put together guides that will take you through the most exciting things about their release. 3 Reasons Not to Install Galaxy S7 Nougat & 6 Reasons You Should Install Nougat If You Want Better Security   1 / 9 Let's start with some basics. If you value your security, and most of you probably do, you'll want to think about installing the Galaxy S7 Nougat update soon after it arrives for your device.  Every month, Google and Samsung release important security patches for Android devices. The Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Android Nougat updates should bring the latest security patches to your device. Samsung's initial batch of Galaxy S7 Nougat updates delivered the company's January security update while upcoming updates could deliver the patches from the February security update. You can read more about their contents on Samsung's website.  If you failed to download or receive an older security update (December, November, etc), the patches from those updates might be baked into your version of Nougat. If not, you might be forced to install them manually before you can download Nougat.  On top of the patches, Samsung's Galaxy S7 Nougat update brings Samsung Pass, a way to secure your identity using biometric data rather than entering your password or ID.  Samsung Pass is like a master key for your various logins and it relies on Galaxy S7's fingerprint scanner. The biometric data is encrypted and stored safely by Samsung Knox.   1 / 9 361 Responses 01/06/2016 Ben Reply i dont see any difference in this version and what I am currently running on my S^ which I just got a few days ago. The hype and the hype over a few stupid changes is crazy. You guys in the media have to stop making things bigger than what they are, When a MAJOR change occurs, then hype and push it. Marshmallow is not a big deal. 01/12/2016 mnet Reply Marshmallow is hug Ben. It is huge because of the features you will get to control app permissions. The “wild west” days of Android apps with their crazy permissions is coming to an end. If you have not discovered all the features of 6.0 yet its because you have not looked into what is really there but instead troll the web. 03/05/2017 Sincose Line Reply Marshmallow is not working fine for many of the Samsung variants but of course after updating to Marshmallow from Lollipop, battery does not work as good as on Lollipop.

This update is about the marshmallow 6.0.1 and you must be talking about marshmallow 6.0 04/18/2016 William Ernst Reply The update sucks if you have an S5, as it has eliminated the feature that lets you transfer applications to the SD card 05/19/2016 Jamario Souza Reply The worst thing after this update is that I simply lost LTE connection. Only acces 3G. With Android 5 I could manage Network Band and select my prefered band, but now I have no access to it. In March it updated to Android 6.0, this month it updated to 6.0.1 and the shit continues. I cannot unlock phone using fingerprint after rebooting phone. It seems to me that Android M has taken a step backwards with my device.

Here’s what I’ve been doing>> USA Jobs Resort 04/14/2016 Robert Reply I disagree. I’ve had my S6 for several months on Lollipop, finally got the update to Marshmallow from Verizon a couple weeks ago and I’m really enjoying it. My S6 has much better battery life and it performs much better in benchmarks and normal use. It’s smoother (not as laggy), apps load faster, messaging is more streamlined (no more waiting to take and send pics through text), and total control of app permissions (finally). Marshmallow is a major update and I couldn’t be happier with it. It’s just a shame it took so long to actually get it. 06/21/2016 laurarussell532 Reply I found a great site that focuses on stay at home mom’s complete guide to gaining a serious amount of money in very little time.

I think that it’s going to be another couple of months before I see it on my Note 4. But some great additions I didn’t expect…they’ve added scrolling screenshot functionality & the Edge is, at last amazing with half screen functionality and loads upon loads of Edge improvements. Battery life seems far better. I haven’t really dug in to fund everything yet, but so far as great improvement.

Had the S3, Note 10.1 (2012) and now Note 4 and always the same with lack of updates or extremely slow to update. Samsung needs to stop making dozens of devices with then dozens of variants of the same device! This is why they can’t update in a timely manner. If Google and Apple can make their device line up simple then so can Samsung! If Apple and Google can bypass carriers for updates and send them direct to users then so can Samsung. Until Samsung smartens up, they have lost me as a customer! Next phone will either be a Google Nexus device or (I hate to say and even think it but) iOS. I left Apple for Android but Google hates sd cards, all other manufacturers are slow to update. It’s ridiculous! Also the fact Samsung is removing the “adoptable storage” feature from their Android 6.0.1 updates is ridiculous! It’s a Google feature and Samsung and LG should have no right to remove/disable it.

Gotta make sure as many people buy the latest and greatest before taking care of their actual customers first.

Sir….. 02/29/2016 ThisGuyEntitledMuch Reply wow 02/29/2016 Charles Reply To the coders, thanks and all that… I’m sure that you busted a gut over this thing. but, Marshmallow doesn’t appear to be worth the risk of bricking your phone. You got Lollipop working ok.. You even dumped out a security patch. It works… It works well… The phone works as advertised. 6.0 and/or 6.0.1 for all the fanfare and hooplah… just doesn’t seem like it’s worth the risk. Maybe after 6.0.1 gets debugged… and/or maybe a 6.0.2 rolls out – or, maybe after the security fixes for it hit the bricks… It’ll be mature to a point where it’ll install and do what it’s supposed to do without doing any harm…. That could be a year away. Hell, there is even super hype blurting out over Android N… – and, they haven’t delivered 6.0.1… Why not talk about O and P while you’re at it…. There are still a lot of un-used letters in the alphabet. There is little or no talk about a USA release… thank god. It has to start out in S. Korea… and work its way west thru Bangladesh and Botswana. Sure, fine… brick pygmy phones if you have to. Don’t release the >1Gb bloat code here – until it works… It doesn’t even have to deliver the BS hype… just don’t brick my phone. and, If at all possible – don’t gut any useful functionality – that I had in Lollipop… We all know BS when we hear it. We know it won’t do all that you say it will do…. In short.. Do no harm… Don’t release an OS that is worse than the one we got. 02/29/2016 Bharath Reply Any chance of Touchwiz update on note 4? 03/01/2016 Young_Android_Runner Reply 29Feb2016 > Marshmallow isn’t here yet but we’re already hearing about a potential successor to the Marshmallow update Huh?

Third, the Settings aren’t all same like Galaxy S7. There is no triple-press home button for one-hand use feature. Fourth, Galaxy Labs is absent. Oh well, can’t think of more at the moment.

If you don’t have it and don’t care, you still didn’t need to post. Let us rant and why don’t you stay quiet? Samsuck is notorious for sending out upgrades late, thanks to their crappy touchwhiz garbage. They have to make sure the newest OS is working with that and thus it takes the longest. This is my first and last samsuck device, not only because of late OS updates (and N is right around the corner), but also because of their rapid charging mode. It wears out their batteries and people have to go buy new ones after about a year. My iPhone 5 that I gave my wife, I bought at launch and it is still working flawlessly on the same battery. My samsuck nope 4 is not holding the charge it once did because of its battery issue. I won’t be buying a new battery, however, I will be buying a new phone. And if I have to sell a kidney to afford and iPhone then so be it. 03/22/2016 Mathew Bolles Reply I received my update on my US Cellular S6 two days ago.

From what I can tell…. No one involved in the process seems to know what the process is. Supposedly, it is really rolling out some where… Botswana… Bangladesh… the Punjab in India. It is rolling of obscure tele-cos… with 10s of 100s of customers… The smaller the better. No projected or predicted or implied delivery dates have been met – any where. Those that got it – and, it worked – don’t seem to have a problem with it… even if it comes with its own completely new set of anomalies. Those that got it and it bricked their devices… simply disappear into non-digital existence. There seems to be some people that may or may not have it… that just love it to death. They are others seeing it as a cure for imagined ills. Then their are a few walking wounded that actually did get it… And, it didn’t deliver as promised. Bottom Line…. So far, it’s a huge non-event… and, that may be the good news… Some devices are skipping this promised land – for the next new – not quite there – version N. Which one must assume will be as nebulous as the nearly existent Marshmallow. This would all be a horrible fate if there was a problem with Lollipop to begin with. Fortunately, Lollipop isn’t all that bad. These promised improvements are like chasing mirages in the dessert… That can be a real problem if you are dying of thirst. The problem for the Android Overlords is that they can’t get any one thirsty for the new products…. Rumors, innuendos, and power of suggestion will only get you – but, so far. Plus, if you deliver one of these half-baked products – and, it bricks millions of devices… that a hell-of-a-lot of negative advertisement to get over. So, the latest update on the update… is that it is still kind of there but not there. No carrier has a completed roll out for all their devices. No device manufacturer has a completed roll out for all their makes and models on all carriers. There isn’t even a single device that is up and running on all carriers. It’s just one very specific make, model, – possibly even a specific block of serial numbers – within a model… pops up with a roll out on – one very specific carrier – usually some where outside the US. This is touted as progress…. Where – in comparison – Apple pulls a roll out and gets 80% of their products updated in a month… Still, ya have to admit….

The people with the new gear *know* they’re good. 03/27/2016 James Zachary Reply My update to Marshmallow was a nightmare. I lost the ability to connect to wi-fi for the Play Store. If Wi-Fi is switched on, only the Play Store does not work. The Play Store works fine on LTE. All other Wi-Fi functions work fine. So I reset my device twice but no improvement. I see this problem happens to other phones at various times but I don’t see a good solution. 03/29/2016 Erik Reply I’ve experienced the same except the problem persists to apps like Pandora and youtube, however my browser app runs the website versions absolutely fine.

Never will I buy a Samsung and it seems they have lost thousands of customers. They told me to do a soft reset 1st. 2nd put phone on safe mode. I did all. When in safe mode I went into play store updated apps. Went into maps and cloud. I to lost ability to connect to WiFi if on 4G. Doing this fixed it.

What is the hold up, samsung??!?!?! Get on the ball, or hire some competent developers to get that update to everyone. This is ridiculous! 03/28/2016 Stan Reply I don’t think it’s too much too ask that Verizon, who are a multi-billion dollar empire, who rushed to be the first US player to update marshallow to Samsung’s phones ensure a safe install. The update BRICKED MY PHONE by not allowing it to charge. Even using a new battery didn’t work! I Have safely updated many phones and computers a million different ways. NEVER have I ever had an update DESTROY A device, let alone an $800 phone! The super messed up part is the take NO accountability for releasing software that can damage your phone. Why do you think people are migrating in DROVES to T Mobil? Me being one…**** Verizon and hope they choke the thousands of dollars I’ve thrown their Way!

Or clear all cache and reboot. 03/29/2016 Marcus Reply I just recently updated my Sprint Galaxy Note 4 to android marshmallow 6.0.1, I also have updated another phone on my account to the Galaxy S7 edge the S7 running 6.9.1 is good so far as expected. However the update to 6.0.1 on the note 4 has a few issues so far, after the upgrade all my Bluetooth connections were wiped out and reconnecting is an issue because I have to reboot the phone and restart the headset 1 or 2 times before the phone sees the headset, I also found that one of tge greatest additions in marshmallows has been left out of the update and that is the theme engine, I mean really what sense does it make to leave out one of the best features, please put out an update that adds this feature back. Leaving out a major update at this stage of the game makes no sense at all. Guy’s get it fixed and get it right. 03/30/2016 Jay Reply Just got the 6.0.1 on my notes 5 sm – n920g 03/30/2016 Pamela Huff Reply My us cellular s6 edge plus updated to marshmallow a couple of weeks ago and I love it. Definitely some edge screen improvements but by far the most useful is having Google now right on top, no matter what page you’re on. 03/30/2016 Charles Reply As roll outs go… this is like standing in the middle of a turtle stampede. Sure, no one wants to rush anything… Why risk bricking your phone? The customers didn’t demand this. The customers aren’t really feeling the burn here… Yet, the vaguest reference of a siting in the most obscure of countries and the smallest of carriers – gets absurd pronouncements. It’ll happen when it happens. About the only good thing you can say about it – is – that it’s worth every penny you paid for it. 04/09/2016 sarcasticdave94 Reply Here’s my 2¢. I’m glad my Note 4 got it as it is an update, it looks OK and works. I don’t like that Sammy took away the ability to move apps to the SD card and that I’ve gotta put the password in every time I reboot the phone. Other methods like fingerprint scan won’t work till after it’s fully rebooted via entering the password. I don’t think I’ve got extra emoji or wherever the modified battery saver was. It did come with a generous supply of Sprint/TouchWiz bloat as usual, but maybe a bit lighter by a few percentage points. I’m glad I didn’t pay for it though. And the next device for me will be called Nexus. See what you get for 2¢. :-P 03/30/2016 Wilson Reply After running the new update my S6 now randomly re-starts itself and I would say roughly half the phone calls are going directly to voicemail. The phone does not ring when this happens. What can be done to correct this? – Thank you. 03/31/2016 Jennifer Stam Reply Mine is doing the same! Frustrating!

Sure, there are some fun new features but not worth it at this point! 03/31/2016 Louise Reply I updated my Samsung S6 last weekend and it’s made absolute crap of my phone. Constantly crashing and freezing. Does anybody know if they are doing a patch soon? 04/02/2016 Jennifer Stam Reply My S6 is junk now after the update too. The better come out with a patch soon! Too many issues to mention here. My phone is messed up! 03/31/2016 Charles Reply Here we are at the close of yet another month… March 31 – with Marshmallow market share resting comfortably at 2.3%… The pundits milestones fall by the wayside once again. and, They refuse to hold silence on their accolades for 6.0.1 – that barely exists… – and, where it does exist – there is no small amount of nashing of teeth. The pundits sell great snake oil…. btw… And, what’s wrong with snake oil – you might say. When was the last time you saw a squeaky snake? oh… well… There is always April – then May – then June…. Maybe some country some where with a sizable telecom – will roll this thing out and get it to work. Buyer be ware… If you got it “on” your new device – don’t panic… it’ll probably work just fine. Upgrading older devices – is always a bit of a crap shoot. If you bought older legacy hardware and update prior to loading your old apps…. that might work ok, too.. Marshmallow isn’t all that evil… It just can’t cope with all the possible combinations of footprints left over from old OS’s and legacy apps. Nothing ever has. Nothing ever will. The glacial roll out is probably a blessing – in that it is sparing you from the infinite new anomalies that you will encounter… The purported enhancements/improvements – may – or, may not – work as advertised. but, At least, you have gotten used to the quirks in your current device. Why suffer the trials and tribulations of different quirks – whilst Beta testing the lasted flavor. I guess that I long for the daze when one could stone false prophets. Back in the good ole daze, if the prophet spoke and got it wrong – they took him out to the gates of the city and stoned him… Not much of a retirement plan… But, it really cut down on people making idiot claims and speculations. 03/31/2016 Charles Reply Verizon has already inflicted/infected the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 users with Marshmallow…. Batteries dying… WiFi croaking… no access to the AppStore… BlueTooth disconnecting…. Who will be the next victim? Will they bless the 6s class? What did they ever do the Verizon… other than subscribe. The good news here – is – that as glacial as Android is with the updates, they aren’t all that essential. The updates sell features that you have never had… you are being told that you want them. Also… it’s great that it’s free… The update is worth every penny that you paid for it. So – not getting something that you don’t need and didn’t ask for – for money that you never paid… isn’t all that bad of a deal… Then Verizon steps in with its non-value added contribution. This slows the process even further. By the time Verizon is finished bloating the code, even more lettered releases appear on the horizon… N, O, P, etc. Which may displace the much exalted M – all together… and, Is that bad? You are still not paying for it. You still didn’t ask for it. You still don’t need it. So, does it ever matter, which version of the next shiny new OS that you aren’t actually getting? The hype seems totally unaffected. These are the same guys that barely got KitKat and Lolipop to stop coughing up blood… and, those two combined only pulled 37% of the market share for Samsung. Marshmallow is languishing at 2.3% – after 4 months. This is almost as much fun to watch as MicroSloth WinWoes rolling out their free WinWoes Tin…. 03/31/2016 Amy Sweet Reply Did the Marshmallow update and I can no longer lock my phone.

I reply “I’m good!” And it corrects the word good and changes it to “not” so I wind up sending “I’m not!” It’s beyond agitating!!! And if I turn it off completely, then I’m left with it correcting nothing at all. So now I’ll have to download a less idiotic keyboard to use and eastern space on my note 5 to do so. this is BS.

My update was just short of 1.4 GB. It has improved my Note by making it feel smoother and more intuitive. It seems to also be a bit lighter as in not so bloated, but I’m unable to confirm that as a fact. The only area I’m disappointed, and it’s a great disservice to us owners in my opinion, I no longer can move apps to the SD card. It’s not even accessable, as in moving apps to it, unless I’m missing something. This in my opinion is a real failure by Sammy. It just confirms my previous plan to go Nexus next time around. 04/09/2016 sarcasticdave94 Reply Sorry for my redundancy at the end there. 04/09/2016 sarcasticdave94 Reply OK so there actually IS a way to transfer files from phone memory to a mounted SD card.

Standby… 04/09/2016 sarcasticdave94 Reply This may help some or all who have received Marshmallow and are having issues with the apps not acting right, the Wi-Fi or etc. This is worth trying once. Learn where you do this on your particular phone as I don’t know about all is of them. I do know I did this to my Sammy Note 4 on Sprint and it helped with crashing apps after updating. Clear all cache. Then reboot. See if it helps. Hint: some devices have a setting menu for this, others you shut off the phone then get to the restore screen to clear cache. Afterwards in either, do a reboot if possible. 04/09/2016 Landon R Caviness Reply Come on AT&T… By far the slowest carrier for updates… 04/10/2016 Ehsan Reply I am overall pleased with the marshmallow update in note 5 features are great interface just goto better, the only thing annoying to me is the grey strip on the top notification panel where battery indicator time etc are located.

The whole point to hands free is to be hands free. Lots of wifi issues, and many symptoms as others have stated. Between not working in the car anymore and the tremendous keyboard lag, Marshmallow has got to he the worst version yet. I downloaded 5.1.1 from sammobile.com and reflashed to downgrade.

Size: 1474.19 MB Version: N915PVPU4DPD1/N915PSPT4DPD1/N915PVPU4DPD1 · OS upgrade – Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow · To get the best from your device, please keep your phone up to date and regularly check for software updates. ※ Fingerprints are securely protected. An alternative unlock method (pattern, PIN, or password) is required to add fingerprints. ※ Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow does not support the Decrypt device function.

Go to Galaxy Apps or Play Store to update apps. 04/21/2016 Charles Reply Marshmallow… 6.0.1 – over hyped… bloated… non-plused…. overall = not bad. For a Samsung Galaxy s6 edge+ / with Verizon, it’s not all that bad. My phone did not brick. My phone is not coughing up blood. The battery does not die… though – I’m not quite sure that the super enhanced improvement is there… The battery is doing ok.. not noticeably worse. The graphic depiction of projected duration is longer… I haven’t tried running it out to 12 hours yet… I don’t run enough BlueTooth peripherals to show a problem… It says its still there… I’m taking it at its word. The WiFi… may have had a problem – or, not…. The home WiFi didn’t skip a beat. The historical archive of pre-existing connections did ok, too… Scanning for potential – new – WiFis could be a problem – or, not… it could just work differently. I’ve had to re-register on a couple of hubs… So far, no big deal. The phone does not get mysteriously hot… or, cold… It does not randomly buzz, vibrate, reboot – or, speak in tongues. All the apps seem to have made it. The app store(s) are still there… — there is a special permission for non-PlayStore apps… Click a button and the Amazon apps, etc… are good to go. The GPS is doing ok. It appears to be doing every bit as well as the old Lollipop… It may be a schoosh faster – snappier. Schoosh…is a technical digital device term = barely noticeable. The user interface “is” slightly different… enough to annoy… I can’t see much of a wow factor in it. The “edge” feature is different… (? better ?)… It’s only better if you were a heavy user to begin with. If you had never bonded to the feature to begin with.. this probably isn’t going to get you anymore involved. So far, Marshmallow is a benevolent improvement. It has done no noticeable harm. I haven’t lost any capabilities. It may even be an improvement – overall. I can’t dodge the feeling that I am missing something… with all the fanfare, there should be some sort of wow-factor that justifies all the hype… Sometimes ya just have to take it as it is… at least, it didn’t set me back. I would recommend it – if I only knew – why? 04/21/2016 Elle Reply Thank you 04/22/2016 Lisa Miceli Reply UGH…not a fan of the update at all.

Is there a user/guest mode on the update for samsung galaxy s6? Most of the features doesn’t work now. Like the notifications are gone, developer options says “it doesn’t work for this user”, multitasking app doesn’t work, home and back button is the only one the works. Please help. 05/02/2016 Charles Reply Marshmallow 6.0.1 doesn’t seem to be all that bad…. Eventually, it automatically downloaded, then the annoying window was there for about a week every time you unlocked the screen. I finally consented for it to install… (Verizon Samsung Galaxy s6 edge plus) It blinked and buzzed… blinked some more.. went dark… for awhile… lit back up… did some more blinking… buzzed…. – after a bit, it looked like it was gunna actually do sumthun… The start screen lit up and it jingled its jangle… Then there was much flashing and an occasional buzz…. Once it finished convulsing, I went for a shut down, which it did. After a few moments of calm, I started it back up again. This time it started with less fan fare… about as quickly as Lollipop… It still wanted to do some tweaking… So, for the first half hour or so – it was clunky. Whatever the upgrade is – it takes time to digest. Over the following week or so… mileage has varied. Nothing bad… = but, no wow factor either. The battery usage is some where between psychotic and bewildering. Sometimes it predicts 8 hours… sometimes 3 days. There are weird slopes in the discharge curve, which effect the battery life prognostications. It may depend on signal strength, whether or not WiFi is enabled… and/or the strength of the WiFi signal.. It may also be effected by back ground app updates and the relative signal strengths during those processes.. and, There may be god knows what going on with apps optimizations. I have not let this thing go for 3 days and attained the promised duration… Before I could get 8hr, 12hrs… maybe 16 hrs… before an auto shut down. The best to date with marshmallow – I’ve gotten down to around 30 – 40% in power savings mode in about 22 hrs…. which is an improvement. I just don’t know if I can believe it. The digital services seem to be a bit snappier, quicker. No big difference with calls, gps, bluetooth, or WiFi… The searching and notifications of “new” WiFi signals may be different – but, the devices seems to connect to the old connections – ok. Basically, It hasn’t screwed much of anything up…. I have a very undemanding regimen for the device. What I had it doing – it still does, which is all I asked for. The new “can’t live without features” – eh… just not all that into them, yet. They aren’t bad… I bought the edge plus for the bigger screen – not so much for the edge technology. There’s nothing wrong with it… just wasn’t a big deal to begin with. With all the tapping, dragging, swiping, pinching, spreading… another way of doing the same stuff just adds another layer of confusion to the process… Still, the edge stuff works… The edge bar is bigger.. If I used it, it would be helpful. I can definitely say, that it was worth every penny I paid for it. It has done no damage. No data lost. No performance lost. No functionality lost. The learning curve for the new features is negligible. This positions the device to take advantage of new features in my existing apps. So far – so good…. It may be a benefit for battery usage and charging It will probably be better on my Samsung Galaxy Tab s2… 05/02/2016 Dustin Hall Reply My S6 updated to Marshmallow this morning and I’m getting all these errors: messaging app totally not working, laggy overload for every app, not recognizing my thumbprint, battery draining exceptionally fast.

I am an AT&T customer and like many of you I have been awaiting the Galaxy Note 4 Marshmallow update, but I have been waiting for it for very different reasons. Some owners of the phone may be waiting for it for the same reasons as well. Here is the problem:   Since the internet released that AT&T rolled out the Galaxy Note 4 Marshmallow update overseas, Google App vendors have been upgrading their softwares for the Note in anticipation of the Marshmallow Platform Update. If you are like me and you have been paying attention, these Google Play Apps update sometime 1 to 5 times weekly. With the updates being installed, the phone begins to freeze in certain applications. The phone may allow you close out the application so you may relaunch it, but in my instance this also means removing the battery cover (waiting for a time) and restarting the device. The reason I have now been told 5 times by AT&T tech reps is that the phone has not been updated with the software needed to support the updated Apps. So basically, between 1 to 6 times daily my device freezes.   Now, when I became upset about this was when I was told to upgrade to a new device, instead of being told when the Marshmallow Update would be released. Basically, my device is acting like it has a virus but is actually working as intended but is having a problem with software in Apps versus Platform issue. This meant I was being told upgrade a perfectly good working phone when there was nothing actually wrong with it. I got to thinking about how many AT&T customers are being told this, who may not be asking the right questions and I became even angrier, as they are throwing money at the company for a problem that is easily fixed:   1.       Either they indicate the Galaxy Note 4 is not going to be upgraded in the US, which causes vendors to stop notifying your phone to upgrade Apps. 2.       Or, they upgrade the phone to Marshmallow Software in the US post haste.   Basically I am outlining a very poor customer service issue. This is either due to AT&T’s negligence, Samsung’s negligence, or Googles. When you call to speak with anyone about this, they point the finger elsewhere as the problem. Warranty sent me a refurbished device to see if it will work better for me. It is on its way. I doubt it will, because of the issues I have been having. I thought I would pass this along to encourage all with a Galaxy Note 4 to call AT&T if you have been told to upgrade your device unnecessarily.   I upgrade, normally to a new phone 1x a year. As a present to myself on my birthday. This is the first time I did not upgrade as I was not happy with the lack of expandable memory in the Note 5. So I kept the phone. So now almost 2 years later, I am having all of these problems with a perfectly good phone and due to lack of SOFTWARE SUPPORT.  I hope me explaining this issues helps address your problem if you are having the same issue yourself. I encourage you to complain. Perhaps this will induce them to release the software, or finally release that they have no intention of doing so. Which also fixes the problem. 05/16/2016 Eric Johnson Reply Very nicely said. You brought out all the problems I was having. After I read your very long message, I was really with on most points. My final thought was I’m going to have to complain and complain. So like you said, complain about these issues were having. Maybe, just maybe that will work. Let’s hope that works. 05/11/2016 Shanna Hall Reply My Galaxy S6 Says That It Is Up to date But My Phone Is Still On lollipop. I haven’t even gotten the option to get marshmallow yet.

Most Samsung’s still run lollipop, while I run the new modern OS Android 7 which came via an OTA as soon as I got my lg nexus which runs pure Android not some dodgy rip off touch wiz crap. Samsung’s owners are some of the last to ever get updates even smaller brands already have marshmallow out of the box. I also get updates before any other brand for the life of the phone not for a limited time like none Google branded phones.

The battery blather… – all the hype about improved battery performance – is a bit weird. The prognostications as to when it will die are all over the place. Sometimes it thinks that it can run for daze on the existing charge… sometimes just 6 to 8 hours… It “does” seem to re-charge faster. It doesn’t seem to be overheated when it does so. So far, it has been benevolently benign…. No lost data… No lock ups. It still works about like it did with Lolipop… I have noticed an occasional re-boot, on its own.. No boot loops. Some apps are a bit snappier and faster… some aren’t… some are the same. It could just be the calm before the storm… The chargers, the cables, the device hardware and OS have come into temporary alignment. We all know that it won’t last….

This seems to be due to some sort of security feature which I hope can be overcome by either Android or Facebook. 06/03/2016 Hussein farouk Reply What about middle east countries 06/03/2016 Faith Reply Am in south africa , when ca we receive Samsung galaxy A7 2016 edition 06/03/2016 Wally Reply My wife and I both have Galaxy S5 with Verizon in the United States, and the Marshmallow update pushed out today! 06/05/2016 Michel Klearman Reply Since the update, my Galaxy 6 has gone crazy!

Samsung Galaxy series with Marshmalow OS are always my first choice in the current market. The features in its new updates are even more attractive than ever. Thanls for the info. 06/16/2016 Patrick Reply Yes AT&T sucks in many was, but as far as the Marshmallow update goes, Samsung has not released Marshmallow for some U.S models. I was anticipating my phone to update in June, but AT&T claims they have not received some Marshmallow updates from Samsung. June is not over, but AT&T will probably take their sweet time sending to phones under their umbrella. 06/16/2016 Alan Reply Samsung s stinks as does att. Note 5 June 16th still no update. I’m thinking about going back to Apple after a decade of this crap 06/19/2016 Phienyx Reply Have they fixed the feature where the LED blinks for unviewed notifications yet? … or is this still not been acknowledged or addressed? 06/23/2016 AJ Reply Samsung as a company should be so ashamed of how they manage all their device updates.. It is clear from that the postings on this article and hundreds like it that they are losing millions of phone sales to apple because of this reason alone. Make less models but keep them updated for min 5 years and you will have loyal supporters not careful ones. PS: return every feature you lost from Note 4 (inc it), make it waterproof and I’ll buy it always. 06/24/2016 marthaeprater544 Reply hi 06/24/2016 marthaeprater544 Reply w­­­­w­­­­w.u­­s­­a­­t­­o­­d­­a­­y.n­­y­­p­­o­­s­­t­­5­­5­­.­­c­­o­­m 06/24/2016 marthaeprater544 Reply I ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­make ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­$86 ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­hourly ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­on ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­the ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­computer. ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­I ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­have ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­been ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­without ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­work for ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­six ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­months ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­Hey you guys I have found the perfect job as a full time student, it has changed my life around!

Why not AT&T? What are AT&T’s plans for rolling out Marshmallow on their Note Edge models (SM-N915A)? 07/09/2016 Jonathan Reply Got the update on my WiFi only Tab S2 and it’s nothing but problems. One user is completely locked out because the fingerprint scanner won’t work and it will not recognize the backup password. The primary user keeps getting an “update security policy/set up fingerprint security” bullshit popup every single time the damn thing is unlocked, so have had to disable security on that user account. On top of that the tablet is often running a lot slower. So far I don’t see any benefits. 07/14/2016 strauss44 Reply Received my Android 6.0.1 today in Canada, via broadband cable from Shaw cable, then by inhouse WiFi to my Samsung Galaxy Tab A. It installed without incident and all apps appear to work fine. Only about six Apps needed updating, and did so on next rebot. All I can tell is essentially cosmetic changes. It does appear that browsers Opera and Firefox run slightly faster.

Mashmallow,go get toasted. You have caused my phone to overheat, slow its connection to almost anything, freeze so I can’t see my unlock pattern with the keyboard constantly coming up on my Homecreen. Finally the best bit, I always clean out old apps and crap to stop security issues and the CPU slowing down, and I no tech geek. So I should get more than five hours out of a battery charge, when all I doing is leaving it switched on? Samsung – Happy for you to send me a new phone. Otherwise I have no choice but to revive my old Galaxy 4. Kinda sux after paying it off over 12 months. 08/12/2016 Shereen Reply I did my update on Galaxy A5 and love the look. I just have a few concerns, I have checked all my settings and I don’t have restricted data active and my whatsapp come through only when I am in wifi or when I go into whatsapp. This wasn’t like this before I did the update. Not sure what went wrong. I also noticed that when I go into my gallery it hangs before showing me the folders so I can view my photos. 08/13/2016 Mrticklesz Reply Its because they’re trying to sell their new products which is no any different than the note 4.. damn you samsung! 08/14/2016 Dee Reply Still no marshmallow for Galaxy Alpha… 08/18/2016 Dwan Sadler Reply Why didn’t the Sprin’ts Marshmallow update come with video calling? ATT, Verizon, and T-Mobile all have Samsung video calling S M H 08/23/2016 fux Reply Galaxy Alpha – waiting is the hardest time! 08/23/2016 Charles Reply ??? Lollipop worked ??? Marshmallow worked. The security patch worked… Worked = didn’t brick the phone. Differences in performance = negligible. Additional features almost unnoticeable. Improvements = possibly… then again – maybe not. At least, this stuff does no harm… and, It’s worth every penny ya paid for it…. Will the next security fix – really – fix anything… It won’t matter. The guys out there hacking code are so far ahead of the security patches – that they aren’t loosing sleep over the security patches. The security patches only patch found leaks anyway. Will Nougat fix the security issues… = probably not… but, it will make life difficult enough on the device owners to make them think that security has improved.. The hackers are way ahead of the process. They’ll have Nougat leaking while it’s still in beta. So.. we will get yet another candy flavor – this year… That will fulfill our un-expressed desires… They’ll add stuff that we didn’t ask for, telling us that we can’t live without it. They’ll sell it as a security necessity, whilst working on all the dozens of known security compromises. And, roll out a bug fix / security patch weeks after they drop the barely out of beta Nougat. All this does not matter to me. I’m in this for the damn phone. So long as I can make calls / receive calls – I’am ok with all the update/patch bull$hit… Just don’t brick the phone. 08/25/2016 sadsds Reply who can tell me when malaysia will get marshmallow update for galaxy a8(-a800f)? 08/26/2016 Ray Reply I just got the Marshmallow update for my AT&T S5 today.

I also just received the update for the Galaxy Tab S 8.4 tablet. I’m glad they supported this tablet but they clearly did as minimal work as possible. There’s almost no visible change whatsoever. No change in notifications or app drawer at all. Some very slight changes in the Settings menu and that’s about it. I am eager to try bonding the SD card with the main storage memory though as the 16 GB tablets have never cut it. 09/12/2016 MarshmallowForcedFacortyReset Reply I was woken up this morning around 1:30 to my phone making the tmobile sound. I get up and it said the update failed, I selected to have it try again and it forced a factory reset on my phone. All my contacts and out of my 200+ contacts I have 11 now. None of my bookmarks for internet browsers are there. I can’t seriously be the only one. I have a Samsung J7, model number SM-7J00T, and I’m in Washington State. Even things some of the things I had saved on my SD card got wiped. So you can imagine I’m beyond many colorful expressions, especially with the line of work I’m in and the fact I’m also in school right now. I’ve lost so many points of contact where phone was the only form of communication I had with people and I have no way of reaching out. 09/21/2016 Mooney Reply This is good one. 09/21/2016 Mooney Reply See …!Super and Easiest 0nl!nee Home opportunity for all. make 87 Dollars per hour and Make 2512 Dollars per month.All you just Need an Internet Connection and aComputer To Make Some Extra cash.

Technology giant Google, which has pranked consumers for yearsPTI | Apr 1, 2017, 06.47 PM IST New Delhi, Apr 1 () Social media today went agog over smartphone maker Xiaomi's plans to launch a smart motorcycle and cab aggregator Ola's robotic 'Wheels' for rides within offices -- only if they were not the All Fool's Day pranks! Technology giant Google, which has pranked consumers for years with some quirky product teasers ahead of April 1, this time showcased 'Google Gnome' -- a smart speaker for outdoors. Similar to Google Home, Google's smart speaker for indoors, Gnome was also to tell the wind speed and also take control of yard tools like tiller and water hose. It was only at the end of Google Gnome's page that the company said, "Google Gnomes are real, but only in our hearts - for now. Happy April Fools'!" Google was quicker to tell the unsuspecting consumers about the prank, while Ola and Xiaomi decided to play it along a little more by deciding to reveal later about the teasers of their so-called new products being just pranks. Ola released a video interview of its co-founder and CEO Bhavish Aggarwal to announce that it was launching 'Ola Wheels' -- designed for ultra-short commute inside corporate parks and equipped with voice-based artificial intelligence. The cab aggregator went on to announce that it it was hiring voice artists for the product and was looking for people with "soulful voice". Xiaomi also roped in its CEO Lei Jun for a video teaser for its new 'smart motorcycle'. The video showed Jun addressing Mi fans in India, where in he said, "We have created a very special product for our Indian Mi fans, the Mi Smart Motorcycle. "Like our devices, it is of very high quality and at a great price. It is launching very soon." The video was shared multiple times from the account of Xiaomi India Head Manu Jain's Facebook account. On Xiaomi India's official Twitter account, the video got several likes and retweets. The campaigns by Ola and Xiaomi drew varied reactions from netizens across the country. While many were quick to call them probable April Fools' Day pranks, there were others who wanted to know the launch dates and other details of the promised products. The Gnome advertisement on Google's official Twitter account also saw several likes and retweets. Audio company Master & Dynamic also announced a new edition of its signature over-ear headphones that it said were made of solid concrete.

Social media went agog over smartphone maker Xiaomi's plans to launch a smart motorcycle and cab aggregator Ola's robotic 'Wheels' for rides within offices -- only if they were not the All Fool's Day pranks! Technology giant Google, which has pranked consumers for years with some quirky product teasers ahead of April 1, this time showcased 'Google Gnome' -- a smart speaker for outdoors. Similar to Google Home, Google's smart speaker for indoors, Gnome was also to tell the wind speed and also take control of yard tools like tiller and water hose. It was only at the end of Google Gnome's page that the company said, "Google Gnomes are real, but only in our hearts - for now. Happy April Fools'!" Google was quicker to tell the unsuspecting consumers about the prank, while Ola and Xiaomi decided to play it along with a little more by deciding to reveal later about the teasers of their so-called new products being just pranks. Ola released a video interview of its co-founder and CEO Bhavish Aggarwal to announce that it was launching 'Ola Wheels' -- designed for ultra-short commute inside corporate parks and equipped with voice-based artificial intelligence. The cab aggregator went on to announce that it was hiring voice artists for the product and was looking for people with "soulful voice". Xiaomi also roped in its CEO Lei Jun for a video teaser for its new 'smart motorcycle'. The video showed Jun addressing Mi fans in India, wherein he said, "We have created a very special product for our Indian Mi fans, the Mi Smart Motorcycle. "Like our devices, it is of very high quality and at a great price. It is launching very soon." The video was shared multiple times from the account of Xiaomi India Head Manu Jain's Facebook account. On Xiaomi India's official Twitter account, the video got several likes and retweets. The campaigns by Ola and Xiaomi drew varied reactions from netizens across the country. While many were quick to call them probable April Fools' Day pranks, there were others who wanted to know the launch dates and other details of the promised products. The Gnome advertisement on Google's official Twitter account also saw several likes and retweets. Audio company Master & Dynamic also announced a new edition of its signature over-ear headphones that it said were made of solid concrete. Weighing at about five kgs, the headphones are supposed to produce the "same high-end sound quality as its metal and leather counterpart", the company said in a blog post. While the company listed the price as USD 399, it ended the post saying "... April Fools'!".

The device is essentially an outdoor version of Google Home. It's able to tell you in which direction and how fast the wind is blowing, turn on/off the hose and even let's you know which plants you can eat. Google released a short video for the Gnome which is surprisingly funny and just a bit dark in one part. There's a decent chance some people will take the Google Gnome at face value. Tech has infiltrated every other aspect of our lives after all. Is a garden gnome with Wi-Fi really all that unbelievable? In today's day and age, no. For this year at least the Google Gnome is a joke, but who knows what 2018 and beyond will hold. #1 IN TREND REPORTS Find Better Ideas Faster™ with our unrivalled research, fueled by 100,000,000 people ➤ Related Top 10 Slideshows Video Pro Services Innovation Accelerator Innovation Keynotes Trend Reports Custom Dashboards Future Festival Free Resources Innovation Videos & Books Weekly Trend Report NEW: 2017 Trend Report Get a FREE Report Cheese-Based MilkshakesThe Cheeeesy Gold Milkshake from Wayback Burgers is Made with Cheez Whiz Pre-Scripted Prank AppsOwnage Pranks' App Features Characters That Voice Automated Crank Calls Telecom Hotspot OnesiesThe T-Mobile 'ONEsie' Offers Unlimited Coverage for April Fool's Day Automated Water Bottle OpenersNidec's SMART PET BOTTLE is Helping to Enliven the World Top 50 Beverage Ideas in JuneFrom Sea Vegetable Juices to Caffeinated Protein Drinks Top 100 Marketing Innovations in MayFrom Screenshot Coupon Ads to Cherry Blossom Bars Stats for Internet-Connected Garden Decorations Trending: New & Hot Research: 18 hr Interest: > 3 minutes Concept: Google Gnome Related: 68 examples / 52 photos Segment: Neutral, 18-55 Comparison Set: 25 similar articles, including: fictional hipster airlines, coffee-flavored creamers, and over-the-top vegan burgers.

Android O feature spotlight: Android will support wide color gamut profiles in apps 2017/03/21 10:57am PDTMar 21, 2017 ... View All 35 Articles In This Series If you've ever used a keyboard with Android, you'll know that the operating system and apps weren't exactly designed around arrow keys or tabbing. And, honestly, there wasn't much in the way of motivation for Google to fix this, historically: Android devices with keyboards are few and far between these days, so why care? Then Android apps on Chromebooks happened, and suddenly, a lot more people are using their keyboards in apps that traditionally only ever saw touch-based interaction. In recognition of this, Google is promising that Android O will offer considerable improvements in the consistency of the experience of navigating your keyboard-equipped (or connected) device by providing more standard behaviors for the arrow and tab keys, in particular. It's not clear exactly what Google means by this at this point, but maybe we'll see Google start mapping certain common navigation intents to these keys by default, as I have a feeling just telling developers they need to do this probably won't land it high on their 'to-do' list. It's definitely the sort of change that needs a more active hand from Google in order to really see progress. We obviously don't know how Google will accomplish this yet (the developer documentation may yield nuggets), but it's encouraging that they're making it a priority.

Lucas de Eiroz ™ Remix OS appreciate this janet.stith I was without work for six months time when my early Fellow worker at last strongly suggested me to begin with freelancing online... That was only after I earned $5000 in my very first thirty days when I seriously believed I really could do this for a living! At the moment I am happier than ever... I work at home and also I am my own boss now like I always wanted... I see quite a lot of disappointed people around me, working the same old boring job that's sucking the everyday life from them day by day... Whenever I see somebody like that I say START FREELANCING MAN! This is where I started off >>>> http://www.cat.org.uk/snip/93439 MJ This is the biggest news I have heard in regards to Android O so far which should make it more useful for productivity aka "work" purposes. How about some phone options with a physical landscape slide out keyboard again? Good_Ole_Pinocchio Stop it. Lol. That segment is dead and will never come back. MJ Huh? Are you in the workforce? Mobile devices certainly have their uses but 90% of real work is done on devices (running Windows) with physical keyboards. I am sure Google would like to be an option in that sector. Touchscreen machines are great for like food service cashiers. LOL Good_Ole_Pinocchio Don't be silly. Blackberry is dead along with their keyboards.The "workforce" has been getting handed iPhones and Android phones for years without keyboards. There's no sector for hardware keyboards. If you're doing so called "real work" on a Windows or Mac machine that doesn't have anything to do with your mobile device. Adam Margeson I miss my HTC G1 and G2. I loved having a slide-out landscape keyboard. Screw Blackberry and their shrunken screens with a crappy portrait keyboard. The *only* reason that I don't have a slide-out keyboard phone right now is because there's nothing available with decent specs. There's a difference between people not wanting keyboards and manufacturers no longer offering them as a valid choice (valid meaning usable specs). PRIV was way overpriced for the experience, and again, it was a portrait keyboard. Good_Ole_Pinocchio If the iPhone doesn't have a keyboard you'll never see Android OEMs with keyboards. It's been dead since the iPhone and that isn't changing. MJ What? That was an argument that was maybe valid a couple of years ago. Smart Android OEMs are NOT blindly following Apple anymore nor should they be...please see the headphone jack. Android is supposed to be about options which needs to be expanded on. Adam Margeson Stop it. Seriously. It has nothing to do with iPhones. For one, the iPhone (2007) came out 481 days before Android (2008). But no. It has to do with Google's compatibility documents. When Android was first released, a full physical keyboard with d-pad was required. After Google got the on-screen keyboard implemented, the keyboard requirement was removed, though the d-pad requirement remained. Once that change to the compatibility documents was made, most phones dropped the keyboard, and the last few kind of dwindled shortly thereafter. Physical keyboards are expensive from a manufacturing/engineering cost. They take up a lot of room, have a lot of moving parts and require lots of engineering time to figure out how to put it all together in the first place. The G1 hinge was interesting, but wore down quickly and the G2's hinge was laughed at from the get go for being a loose hinge as some people thought that holding the phone upside down was a "normal" position to hold the phone. Prezes Dyrektor Dpad, dpad wherest art thou (and touchpads). I loved em on my older phones, HTC Desire Z you were the bomb Gen. Chang My HTC Touch Pro 2 had an awesome slide out keyboard with tilt screen. Even though it ran Windows 6.5, I loved that phone. But, HTC has had an option, since ICS, on virtual keyboard to add the navigation arrows. One of the very few keyboards that do. It's the main reason I've never tried any others. MJ You are confused. I had two points... People mostly get real "work" done with desktop machines with keyboards SO Google making Android better suited for keyboard input allows Android devices whether laptops or 2 in 1 devices to be a more viable option for "work". Phones with physical keyboards is a separate thought and doesn't need to have anything to do with work. I do a lot of texting (and some coding which won't do a phone at all) which the majority of I still do on a PC. A real keyboard would make my phone more useful to me. Zach Mauch I understand why you don't get it with flagships. Why we can't a least get decent keyboard cases or a moto mod keyboard is beyond me. It is a major increase in productivity when using it. Q. https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/keyboard-mod-a-physical-keyboard-for-the-moto-z#/ Syukri Lajin i once typed a whole essay on my phone, and then used select all, intending to copy it, but somehow managed to hit one latter on my phone, and the whole thing were gone. if only there's an undo button on android.... YaKillaCJ I miss My HTC G2 & Moto Cliq landscape keyboards. Kawshik Ahmed Chrome OS still didn't get Android 7 even as an alpha. It has even worst update situation then actual Android. I think this feature was intended for Andromeda. boop ChormeOS' Android implementation is still in Beta. It'll come out of Beta, 7.1.x in tow in the next month or so and updates should be a lot faster then. Kawshik Ahmed Yes, that's the thing Google is not able to make it good enough to pull it out from the Beta status after so many months. They even admitted the Nougat implementation on Chrome OS is very buggy that's why they are not launching it yet. If it take so much to fix bugs then making Android it self more like a PC OS is the best thing, we are even seeing this in Android 7.1.2 with the new Recent screen in Pixel C which is very similar to the Chrome OS's Overview screen. And Chrome OS can't even run any of the Customization app from the Play Store like 3rd Party Keyboard, Icons, Widgets not to mention can't even place icon the Desktop. I hope Andromeda is true and not abandoned. Zach Mauch Actually, the Canary build of ChromeOS is using Android 7.1. As Android Apps are still in beta on chrome OS you can't blame them for being behind. I read once they are out of beta they plan to be up to date with the current android version quickly. I would expect Chrome OS stable build to be an Android O within release cycle (6 weeks) of the final Android O build. iKon We need a copy and paste button built into the keyboard, because some apps dont let you hold down and copy/paste... Martin Cohen I have found that ctrl-c, ctrl-v, and ctrl-x work in nougat on Verizon Galaxy S7. Also on Hacker's keyboard. thartist What's the name of that keycap set? thartist HMMMMMMMMMMMM... DOESN'T IT SOUND LIKE SOMEONE IS STARTING TO GIVE KEYBOARDS SOME ATTENTION... FOR AWE-SOME-DROMEDA REASON??? wink wink! JG I don't know why I'm so jazzed for this idea... It probably has less of a chance of actually happening than does Google adding microSD to the Pixel line... But things are kind of falling into place... Last night I read an article about the Qualcomm 205 Mobile Platform. And then this today... I would really like to see Google release an Android (-lite?)* feature phone. Maybe pay homage to the fact they use to own Motorola and relaunch the Moto Razr flip phone. It was a hot must have phone back in the day. Or just make their own G-Flip or whatever. It'd be a niche product and wouldn't sell a whole lot, that's for sure... But I could see them being useful in some circumstances. Like as a kid's first phone. Or as a backup device to use in circumstances when you need to stay in touch but you don't want to risk damaging or loosing your $1,000 Pixel phone. Or times when you'll be away and won't have access to a plug for awhile, like a week long camping trip. The article I was reading on the SoC mentioned Qualcom promising 45 days of standby time, 20 hours of talk time, and 86 hours of music playback (though I think that would be more dependent on the size of the battery the OEM uses than the processor)... HMD Global was able to relaunch the Nokia 3310 for about $50 USD. I'd imagine Google could probably aim for a $100 price range and still produce something fairly decent. *I was kind of thinking more Android Wear like than proper Android, as the display would be roughly the same size & Wear provides a simpler interface more conducive to D-Pad (with most navigation being swiping left/right or up/down). Browningate Well, they're only about seven years late to the party on that one. Maybe OEMs can treat this as an opportunity to start pushing out some more keyboard sliders.

Google always does a great job, from the Pokemon Google Maps overlay to a smart mailbox, but there are a few from other companies worth mentioning. Here's a rundown of all the hillarious (or strange) tech-related April Fools Day jokes from around the web. Google Gnome One of Google's product launches from last year was the Google Home, a $129 smart speaker with Google Assistant. Now the company is teasing the "Google Gnome," an outside version of the Home. You can ask it weather questions, let it control your lawnmower and other tools, and even dress it up in accessories. The Google Gnome has a page on the Google Store, but unfortunately you can't buy it. I really want a rain coat for my Google Home, though. Mrs. Pac-Man in Google Maps For April Fools' 2015, Google added Pac-Man into Google Maps and Ingress. This year, Mrs Pac-Man is invading Google Maps. For regions of the world already on April 1st, a new Mrs. Pac-Man button is visible on the mobile app. You then have to control Mrs. Pac-Man on real-life streets, and of course, outrun the Ghosts. Google's Bubble Wrap Keyboard (English subtitles are available) Google Japan's prank is pretty funny - it's a bubble wrap keyboard. The idea is to pop bubbles on a bubble wrap sheet to form words, then feed the sheet through a reader to send the message. Some of the bubble wrap sheets are even scented. Google Assistant Google has plenty of Easter Eggs in Google Assistant, and as you might expect, there's one for April Fools' Day too. When asked, Assistant will offer advice on how not to get pranked, such as "If something seems too good to be true today, it probably is." Google Wind Google's Netherlands division has its own April Fools' Day gag, named 'Google Wind.' The idea is to use machine learning to control the weather, using Holland's famous windmills. I'll admit, this one is pretty great. Netflix Live Will Arnet has been in plenty of Netflix original content, from BoJack Horseman to A Series of Unfortunate Events. For April Fools' Day, Netflix is proud to share 'Netflix Live', which is nearly an hour of Arnett commentating ordinary events like toasting bread and completing a crossword puzzle. It's actually funnier than it sounds. You can watch the full thing here (a Netflix subscription is required). T-Mobile ONEsie T-Mobile's prank is a onesie, with "full-body coverage" and a built-in 4G LTE hotspot. You can actually buy it for $40, but the real one doesn't have any tech inside it. Hulu Hu With the claim that the human attention span has "dropped to eight seconds," Hulu has released 'Hu.' It's just a library of short clips from existing Hulu content, and you actually need an account to see them. This is probably the lamest April Fools' Day gag in the list - better luck next year, guys. OnePlus Dash drink OnePlus is really proud of its Dash Charge feature, even to the point of enlisting celebrities to talk about it. For April Fools', the company made real Dash Charge energy drinks. You can find our review of the drink here. Lyft Mono For April Fools' Day, Lyft has announced the 'Lyft Mono.' It's a wearable glove, vaguely resembling a Nintendo Power Glove. This gag is actually real, and once you put it on and get the app, sticking out your thumb will hail a Lyft cab. You can sign up to for a chance to get one here. Honor BFF We all need some positive reinforcement every now and then, right? Honor thinks so, and created the Honor BFF. This imaginary phone uses machine learning to periodically give you compliments and motivation. Hopefully it ships with Android 7.1 Nougat. Google Haptic Helpers This is probably my favorite gag so far. In order to create a more realistic virtual reality experience, you can schedule a "haptic helper" to come to your house and help create a more realistic environment. Just watch the video, it's hilarious. Amazon Petlexa Alexa is cool and all, but your furry friends need one too. As the name implies, Petlexa is Alexa for your pets. Contour by SlickWraps Putting a skin on your phone or tablet is too much work. For April Fool's Day, Slickwraps is teasing the 'Countour' - a machine that sprays on device skins. Frankly, I'm not sure if this is actually real or not, but there is a page for it on SlickWrap's store. Nvidia GTX G-Assist How many times have you been playing an online game, only to be interrupted by someone in real life? NVIDIA has made the 'G Assist,' a flash drive that can take over for you if you're busy. It can also help you beat boss battles, and provides periodic reminders to consume energy drinks. More information and a video can be found here. Google's data center on Mars If you have important data, you need a backup. That's why Google announced its first interplanetary data center, named "Ziggy Stardust," on the Google Cloud Platform Blog today. Located in the Gale Crater on Mars, it will store a cache of data from Earth to prevent irrecoverable loss when a planetary disaster strikes. Google hopes to finish the data center by 2018. LineageOS' mascot CyanogenMod's mascot, Cid, was one of the most recognizable icons in the Android community. As the spiritual successor to CyanogenMod, LineageOS has created its own mascot - 'Ink'. The project also announced 'Br0zip,' an artificial intelligence that can port LineageOS to any device in no time at all. Chromebook accessories Even though most Chromebooks can now run Android apps, you still can't use your Chromebook like an Android phone/tablet for all use cases. Until now, that is. Google has announced a Chromebook Groupie Stick (seen above), a Chromebook Cardboard headset, and a Chromebook armband. See the company's blog post for more info. Exynos Yoga Processor Remember when curved phones were a thing? Maybe we'll see more in the coming months, because Samsung has just unveiled the Exynos Yoga Processor - the first flexible mobile SoC. Anyone up for a Galaxy Flex? Carved screen protector Carved is a small Indiana-based phone case company, but now they are working on a wooden screen protector. Why hasn't this been done before? I'll take ten. I'm Feeling Woof/I'm Feeling Meow By force-touching the Google app icon in iOS, you can select "I'm Feeling Woof" or "I'm Feeling Meow." These give your pets access to the stuff they care about - from dog food to balls of yarn. More info can be found on Google's blog post. Waze maps for Mars According to the company's blog, Waze is has begun to map the surface of Mars. Certain members of the Waze community will also be sent to the Red Planet to more accurately map the surface. JerryRigEverything's NoPhone video If you haven't heard about it, the NoPhone is a solid piece of plastic designed to simulate the feeling of a phone in your pocket. I'm not really sure if anyone uses it, but JerryRigEverything is happy to break it just as much as any other phone. Google Translate for Heptapod B Using machine learning, Google Translate can now decrypt messages written in Heptapod B - the language from the film Arrival. On an unrelated note, it looks like someone from Google is still rocking a Nexus 10. See Google's blog post for more info. Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s ASUS has an April Fools gag too - the Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s Veritas Blue Limited Special Edition. I would probably buy this phone. MKBHD's Nokia 3310 review You may have heard about the updated Nokia 3310, but it turns out the original is an amazing smartphone. Okay, maybe not, but the video is pretty funny. Open GApps Femto Do you need to flash the latest Gapps package on your device, but you don't have a stable network connection? Not to worry, the Open GApps Femto package is here to help. It uses the United States HAARP service (which is not real, but just pretend) to download the latest GApps package. You can find more info at the GApps blog.   That concludes our coverage of April Fools' Day in the tech world. Let us know in the comments below which gag you liked the most!

Yeah they actuqally had me going until I compared a whois of kodi.tv vs kickasstorrents.com, a site that actually was seized. The whois data would show that it is not official. Derik Taylor So this is one I find interesting. Could it technically be a criminal offense to falsify a domain seizure? How would that work? mondeca I hope every year that Google will announce something real and awesome on April Fools' Day, like they did with Gmail. Once again, I am disappointed. JG It isn't technically April Fools Day yet... Least not in the US... Jordan Introducing the Boeing Dreambird 1417 https://www.facebook.com/virginatlantic/videos/10155188765647679/ andyy Corbin, the last one (SlickWraps) isn't embedded properly Artem Russakovskii Thanks, fixed it. BatJake Will Arnett sounds like Michael Keaton. Corbin Davenport And they both have played Batman. Peterson Silva "Frankly, I'm not sure if this is actually real or not" Well then THAT ought to be the best one! Trooper311 Gimme dat gnome yo. abqnm The Google Haptic Helpers was OK, until they applied the "I Voted!" sticker to the guy's shirt. I was laughing and crying at the same time. Corbin Davenport Yep, that had me laughing too. AdrianFDiratama . How about JG I'd actually like to see Google produce the Google Gnome.... All they'd need to do is add a battery (and Qi charging) to a Google Home and stick it in a new Gnome shell... Make sure its IP68 and maybe even MIL-STD-810G certified. It'd be a fun little gadget to put on the picnic table of your next summer back yard get together. Pump out some tunes, order pizza & Ubers for everyone to go home in, etc... Or take out when you work in the garden & don't want to get your phone dirty... Maybe even produce one with an LTE radio (and GPS). Then you could take it out of WiFi range camping. Wake up and find him chilling next to your tent in his little chair "Hey Google, how's today's weather? When does the rafting place open? How far away from the camp site is it?" cdotlawrence Maybe like a more customizable (from a looks standpoint), durable, & usable-on-go version of Home? Google Home Pro/Ultra?

"Following" : "Follow"}} April 01, 2017 8:45am   Comments Share: Related GM Steve Sosnick's General Motors Options Trade Greenlight's Dual-Class Proposal To GM: It May Not Mean What You Think It Means David Einhorn Discusses Plan to Unlock Value at General Motors (GuruFocus) Related GOOGL Merkle Takes A Look At Ad Spend Across Internet Names Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For March 31, 2017 This Top Stock Mutual Fund Cheers Retirement Investors With Gains (Investor's Business Daily) Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) shares have shed roughly 4 percent since the YouTube ad-boycott controversy erupted. Sell-side analysts for their part, raised red flags — lowering estimates, ratings and price targets — while there were others who saw it as a temporary issue. The Controversy Some European companies, including Guardian, GlaxoSmithKline plc (ADR) (NYSE: GSK) and HSBC Holdings plc (ADR) (NYSE: HSBC) announced their intentions to boycott advertising on Google's YouTube channel due to YouTube airing objectionable content alongside the companies' advertising. Subsequently, U.S. companies followed suit, including: AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T). The Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO). General Motors Company(NYSE: GM). Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ). PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE: PEP). Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX). Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ). Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE: WMT). General Motors confirmed to Benzinga that it has suspended ads on YouTube until Google adheres to its brand standards. Nomura Sees A 7.5% Hit To Top Line From Boycott A boycott from over 250 advertisers could cost Google $750 million in 2017, according to a Statista report quoting Nomura. Nomura has lowered its 2017 revenue forecast for Google by 7.5 percent. Putting Things In Perspective For many companies, a $750 million hit could mean an end to their business. But not for Google. Google's ad revenues, net traffic acquisition cost, totaled $63 billion in 2016, with the potential for $70 billion in 2017. The potential $750 million in foregone revenues would represent 1.07 percent of Google's total ad revenues. Here is the comparative chart prepared by Statista of Google's ad revenues, with and without the impact of a boycott: Source: Statista Leaving No Stone Unturned Philipp Schindler, Google's chief business officer, outlined in a blog post measures that would give brands more control over where their ads appear. They include: Raising the bar for Google's ad policies. This includes removing ads more effectively from content that attacks or harasses people based on race, religion, gender or similar categories. The company intends to tighten safeguards to ensure that the ads show up only against legitimate creators in its YouTube Partner Program. Increased brand safety levels and controls for advertisers. The company intends to achieve this by evolving safer defaults for brands, offering simplified management of exclusions and more fine-tuned controls. Increasing resources, accelerating reviews and improving transparency.

However, not everyone can afford a shiny new $800 phone. As a result, we’ve put together a guide showing users how to get the best Galaxy S8 features for free. Skip the upgrade and add many of the neat features Samsung recently unveiled to your Android smartphone. From rounded corners on the screen, the always on display, or even edge apps and more. That’s the beautiful thing with Android, it’s highly customizable. Read: 95 Best Android Apps for 2017 If you love the Galaxy S8 but don’t plan on upgrading, we have some ideas. We’ll help you add many of the best features or aspects of their new phone to any and all Android devices. Tablets and smartphones alike. It might not have the same beautiful 5.8-inch screen with tiny bezels, but it will liven up your phone and give it some excitement. Whether you can’t wait to get the Galaxy S8 and want its features now, or won’t be getting one at all. Almost every killer new feature that people are excited about can already be done. With our help you can add all of those features to any smartphone. We’ll start with a few basics. Like rounding the corners of the screen for a more aesthetically pleasing look. Then do more advanced features like the always-on display, Edge apps panel, Bixby assistant and other things. Read: 13 Galaxy S8 Features You’ll Love & 1 You Won’t Those who own a cheap Android smartphone will never be able to take great photos like a Samsung. Nor will the screen suddenly have a higher resolution or have vivid colors. That’s just part of buying a budget device. However, everything else can be added with some neat apps from the Google Play Store. Add Galaxy S8 Rounded Corners to Any Screen We’re not talking about the curved edges, but the rounded corners. One of the hottest new features that debuted on the LG G6 and is now coming to the Galaxy S8 is rounded corners. The actual screen is rounded, rather than having sharp corners. This isn’t just for looks either, as it makes the display more durable. Instead of a corner taking the grunt of the force from a drop, a rounded edge dissipates it easier. Furthermore, this is more aesthetically pleasing on the eyes, and is a nice touch to recent smartphones in 2017. Did you know we can add rounded corners to any Android phone or tablet? Lets do it. There are multiple apps on the Google Play Store that will do exactly this. The screen won’t actually be rounded, but it will look like it. Two apps come to mind, and we’d recommend trying both. Download – Roundr Try – CornerFly Roundr has been around for a long time, and works pretty well. A similar hack is available on Cydia for the iPhone too. However, more recently I’ve been using Cornerfly as it works best on high resolution screens. Not to mention the app has a host of options, controls, and settings for the best experience. You can even change how drastic the rounding effect is on your device. It’s pretty neat, so try one today. Get an Always-On Display on Any Android A highlight feature from 2016 and now this year is what’s called an Always-On Display. Or an AOD screen. Essentially Samsung’s Galaxy S8 turns on a very small percentage of the screen, just a few pixels, and displays information 24/7. Like the time, date, weather, battery life and incoming notifications. The always-on display is great, and barely takes any battery life over an 8-hour work day. We can do that too, and here’s how. Read: How to Add Always On Display to Your Phone Our link above is a detailed guide on how to use the app called Glance Plus, and it explains everything. The benefits, pros and cons, and a few quarks you may run into while using it. Still, it turns on small areas of the screen at all times (or with a wave or gesture) to give us information at a glance. Download Glance Plus, set the features you want and enjoy a Galaxy S8-like experience. Edge Apps and Features Another thing users love about the Galaxy S8 (or Galaxy S7 Edge) is the apps and features of the edge panel. The curved sides of the screen glow certain colors with incoming calls and texts, and are customizable. Or there are instant apps you can quickly access by swiping in from the edge of the screen. Even quick access to your favorite contacts. This is Android though, and that means almost all of those features can be added to your smartphone too. Download – Edge Color Notifications Use The – Edge Launcher Download – Edge People App The “Edge” of Samsung’s recent phones do a lot of neat things. Our three apps above are just a few of many. Get the same glowing notifications lights with Color Notifications. Add tons of controls and an entire new experience to your home-screen with the Edge Launcher. Or just get instant access to your favorite contacts with the Edge people app. You’re welcome. Virtual Assistant – Bixby A selling point for Samsung over the next year with the Galaxy S8 will be their new virtual assistant. Similar to Siri, or Amazon Alexa is something called Bixby. You can ask the virtual assistant all types of questions or commands and get help. It’s like our own personal assistant ready and waiting right on the phone. There’s even a dedicated button to launch Bixby. We may see a hacked version of the Bixby app at some point, but for now there’s something almost just as good. It’s called the Google Assistant. Available for any and all Android smartphones. Long-press the home button (if you have the Google apps installed) and opt-in to begin using the Google Assistant. Enable – Google Assistant Download – Google Goggles One other cool part of the Bixby Assistant is the magical camera tools. Launch Bixby and open the camera and the magic begins. Bixby can scan products and get more information, share details on a historical landmark or building, find a pair of shoes for sale and more. Including translation of languages and text. Google Goggles is a super old app that does something similar. So give it a try. And just for fun, we can act like our phones have an Iris Eye Scanner, even though that’s a feature that can’t actually be enabled without the required hardware. Still, it’s fun to prank people with apps like this one. Samsung Themes or Launchers Last but not least are themes or launchers. For those that don’t know a custom Launcher will change the way your home screen, lockscreen, icons and app tray look. Options like NOVA Launcher deliver a stock Android feel, but there are themes that will make it look like a Samsung Galaxy S8. Just download themes or icon packs. And while most people aren’t the biggest fans of the colors or look of Samsung’s skin over stock Android, there are launcher that emulate the entire look and feel. Try some of those too, if you’d like. Other Details Users can always download 3rd party camera apps that offer more controls or functions, to deliver a better camera experience similar to that of a Samsung. And a lot of other apps are available in the Google Play Store with Samsung-like features. Nothing will actually deliver the same experience 100% but we can get pretty close. For now you can round those corners and get the always-on display, which are two of the most popular features of the Galaxy S8. Good luck, and drop us a comment below with any other tips or fun apps.

Photo by Josh Reynolds for The Washington Post   Elizabeth Dwoskin and Craig Timberg The Washington Post     As the owner of a small business in liberal Massachusetts, John Ellis was a natural sympathizer of the nationwide call for advertisers to boycott Breitbart News, with its hard-edge conservative politics and close ties to President Donald Trump. But it made Ellis wonder about other, more extreme right-wing sites: Who is placing ads on them? A few clicks around the Internet revealed a troubling answer: He was. On a website owned by white nationalist leader Richard Spencer, Ellis saw an ad for his engineering company, Optics for Hire, pop up on the screen -- even though he had never knowingly bought the ad. What Ellis had stumbled on was a little-known facet of the booming world of Internet advertising. Businesses using the latest in online advertising technology offered by Google, Yahoo and major competitors are also increasingly finding their ads placed alongside politically extreme and derogatory content. That's because the ad networks offered by Google, Yahoo and others can display ads on vast numbers of third-party websites based on people's search and browsing histories. Although the strategy gives advertisers an unprecedented ability to reach customers who fit a narrow profile, it dramatically curtails their ability to control where their advertisements appear. "No one has any idea where their ads are going," Ellis said. In some cases, he added, ad networks "are monetizing hate." In a sign of growing frustration, AT&T, Verizon and other leading companies this week pulled their business from Google's AdSense network in response to news reports that ads had appeared with propaganda from the Islamic State and violent groups. But the issue is broader. A Washington Post examination of dozens of sites with politically extreme and derogatory content found that many were customers of leading ad networks, which share a portion of revenue gleaned from advertisers with the site's operators. The Post's examination found that the networks had displayed ads for Allstate, IBM, DirectTV and dozens of other household brand names on websites with content containing racial and ethnic slurs, Holocaust denial and disparaging comments about African Americans, Jews, women and gay people. Some of these sites, the Post found, featured hateful and derogatory content throughout. In others, it was confined to comment sections, where users went far beyond the language used by the sites' writers, whose expressed views fell closer to the political mainstream. Google's AdSense, for example, last month ran ads for several firms alongside comments using a slur for African-Americans, saying "hang them all." Other Google-displayed ads, for Macy's and the genetics company 23andMe, appeared on the website My Posting Career, which describes itself as a "white privilege zone," next to a notice saying the site would offer a referral bonus for each member related to Adolf Hitler. "No business wants to be associated with sites like that," said Andy Kill, spokesman for genetic testing company 23andMe. "If you're trusting an ad algorithm to do this, this is what can happen," he said. "It's frustrating." My Posting Career did not reply to an email seeking comment. The problem has emerged as Web advertising strategies have evolved. Advertisers sometimes choose to place their ads on particular sites -- or avoid sites they dislike -- but a growing share of advertising budgets go to what the industry calls "programmatic" buys. These ads are aimed at people whose demographic or consumer profile is receptive to a marketing message, no matter where they browse on the Internet. Algorithms decide where to place ads, based on people's prior Web usage, across vastly different types of sites. The technology companies behind ad networks have slowly begun to address the issue but warn that it won't be easy to solve. They say their algorithms struggle to distinguish between content that is truly offensive and language that is not offensive in context. For example, it can be hard for computers to determine the difference between the use of a racial slur on a white-supremacy site and a website about history. The tech companies have also long been reluctant to put themselves in the position of an arbiter of speech -- given the subjectivity involved and the legal risk of making decisions about what content deserves to be read or not. It's a situation that tech giants are increasingly encountering in related spheres, too, with the proliferation of false and highly politicized news sites spreading misinformation on social networks. On Monday, following inquiries from The Post and requests from advertisers who also had been contacted by The Post, Google apologized to advertisers. It announced it would be conducting an "extensive review" of ad policies with the goal of taking a tougher stance on "hateful, offensive, and derogatory content." Google said such comments violate its hate-speech policies but would not say whether it had taken action against the sites. The company said it reviews thousands of sites each day for violations and booted more than 100,000 publishers -- including many single-author publishers -- from its AdSense network in 2016. Yahoo, which blocked one site that was the subject of a query by The Post, said it condemns racist or other hateful speech, adding, "Of the billions of ads served on a daily basis, there are rare instances when automated ad platforms serve ads in places they shouldn't." (The Washington Post sometimes uses such networks to place ads touting its offerings, such as subscriptions, and also generates revenue featuring ads sold through advertising networks.) Many of the companies contacted for this story -- including IBM, bareMinerals, Macy's, Everquote and Allstate -- expressed surprise and dismay that their ads appeared near derogatory content. Several said they had requested that networks blacklist those pages, which is easy to do for individual sites but not for entire categories of sites. Automated filters typically miss certain kinds of derogatory speech, and tech companies traditionally have not hired the massive number of people necessary to carefully monitor content on billions of Web pages. Some advertisers also expressed frustration that ad networks had failed to keep marketing messages from appearing alongside reader comments that might upset customers -- even on sites that themselves do not promote extremist content. Google's AdSense, for example, displayed an ad for cosmetics company bareMinerals in the comments section of Weaselzippers.us, an aggregator of conservative news. A user comment on the site used a derogatory word for gay men and said they should be "lying in a pool of blood." When The Post emailed an image of the Web page to bareMinerals spokeswoman Joanne Chiu Sulit, she said, "I was shocked that we were on that site." An email to Weaselzippers.us operators was not returned. -- -- -- The issue of ad placements has become charged in an era of rising political polarization. The number of right-wing hate sites, as well as sites that traffic in sensationalist news and hoaxes, has doubled over the past year, according to ad auditing firm DoubleVerify. With so many new sites, it's difficult for advertisers to avoid having their ads appear in unwelcome places. "It's whack-a-mole," said Wayne Gattinella, chief executive of DoubleVerify. "You can flag keywords. You can use algorithmic decision-making to minimize it, but there is no way to filter the word choice in real time." Advertisers generally have little choice but to depend on ad networks. The major ones have policies prohibiting advertising on sites featuring discriminatory or hateful speech, but The Post found dozens of apparent violations. Many of the sites where The Post found violations are considered hate sites by the Southern Poverty Law Center, an advocacy group that tracks hate speech. "[Ad networks] have rules in place, but they don't enforce them," said Jillian York, an advocate with the Electronic Freedom Foundation, which runs Online Censorship, a program pushing technology companies to clarify why they remove content. Last month, an ad for insurance company Allstate appeared on Alternative-Right.BlogSpot.com, whose comments section praised "Hitler and his National Socialists as a visionary." Allstate said it has tried to avoid such sites through filters. "Allstate does not knowingly advertise on media that provokes hate or includes threatening, discriminatory or offensive language," spokeswoman Laura Strykowski said. Everquote and DirectTV ads appeared on Spencer's site, RadixJournal.com, alongside comments decrying the Catholic Church for advocating racial mixing and deluging white, Christian countries with "savages of the worst kind." DirectTV declined to comment. Everquote said that although it uses ad networks, "We specifically require that these advertising networks refrain from placing our ads on any sites containing and/or relating to, among other things, violence, sex, racism, sexism, pornography, illegal or potentially illegal subject matter, negative publicity or any other highly explosive subject matter." Ads for Macy's, Amazon.com, and even Planned Parenthood, appeared on the racially inflammatory website My Posting Career. Ads to shop on Amazon.com appeared on a site with an article headlined "Yes, I am a Nazi," and a comments sections peppered with profanity and racial slurs. Amazon, which also runs an ad network, declined to comment. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Post.) -- -- -- Silicon Valley companies long have resisted calls to more aggressively police content on their platforms, saying a free and open Internet is the underpinning of the Web itself. With the exception of child pornography, Congress largely has agreed with the Silicon Valley viewpoint, leaving tech companies substantial legal leeway to monitor -- or not -- the content that appears on the sites and platforms that they operate. But advertisers are demanding changes. "[Tech companies] are struggling to adjust to a reality where the same tools that enabled them to connect the world are now being used to drive it apart," entrepreneur and venture capitalist Noah Lichtenstein said. "This is the crisis of our time: How do you balance the desire to have the Web be open and connected with a rising tide of institutionalized hate and the protection of those who are being attacked?" It's not clear how effective the push to deprive such sites of advertising will be. Spencer said targeting Radix Journal and similar sites is unfair to advertisers because they have so little control over where their ads appear. And if the goal is to deprive extreme sites of money, he predicted the effort would have little effect because the revenue from Web ads is so small, totaling at most a few thousand dollars a year. "If I were kicked off of all of these things, it would have no effect on my life whatsoever," Spencer said. Emails to contact information listed for Alternative-Right.blogspot.com received no reply. Breitbart News also did not return emails seeking comment about the advertising boycott directed against the site. Disqus, a Silicon Valley start-up that manages comments sections for 4 million sites, including those for Breitbart News, Radix Journal and Occidental Dissent, sells advertising alongside the comments. It has been trying to work through the issues raised by inflammatory content, said chief executive Daniel Ha, adding that the company has been flooded with complaints about hate speech from users, advertisers and employees. "User-generated content has always been extremely chaotic, and that's part of what makes the Internet so amazing -- you can share very unpopular ideas," Ha said. "I think, however, that we've seen in the last year that there's a bigger responsibility for how that affects society." The company's terms and conditions prohibit instances of "extreme discrimination" on its comment boards, and a team of 10 reviewers makes the judgment calls. He said the line between "targeted harassment that feels violent" vs. someone making an off-color joke isn't always clear. In a blog post last month, the company announced a new tool that allows users to flag offensive comments. But the software is still largely untested. Ha said he had blocked three of the extremist sites after being contacted by The Post. One of them, the neo-Confederate site Occidental Dissent, used the development to make a public call for more donations, earning what site founder Brad Griffin said was about $1,000 -- several times more than the advertisements had produced in recent months. "It worked out nice for me," Griffin said.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones Is Google Pixel the best camera phone? It is superior to iPhone 7, HTC 10, Galaxy S7, Huawei P10 and others The Google Pixel and its sibling Pixel XL are making waves not only for its cool camera features but also for other specs. Raymond Ronamai   April 1, 2017 17:58 IST The Google Pixel phone is displayed during the presentation of new Google hardware in San Francisco, California, U.S. October 4, 2016.REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach One of the most sought-after features of a mobile phone today is camera. People take selfies and record vlogs with smartphones besides capturing memories and pictures of beautiful landscape, as it is not easy to carry a DSLR camera everywhere. This is why all OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturer) are trying to woo the consumers with good camera features, and there are dozens of them currently available in the market but Google Pixel is said to be the leader of the pack. The Google Pixel and its bigger sibling Pixel XL made its presence felt with its impressive specifications when it was released in the fourth quarter of 2016. However, one feature that stood out clearly was its camera. It mounts a 12.3MP main camera with f/2.0 aperture, 1/2.3" sensor size, 1.55µm pixel size, phase detection & laser autofocus, and dual-LED (dual tone) flash, and an 8MP front-snapper with f/2.4 aperture, 1/3.2" sensor size and 1.4 µm pixel size. Also read: Google Pixel XL review: A great start for a debut phone Now, a review by DxOMark website, which is known for providing image quality ratings for cameras, lenses, and mobile devices, has said that the Google Pixel has the best camera at the moment. It has given the Google device a total score of 89 points, making it the best camera smartphone. It scored 90 in the department of exposure and contrast, colour – 85, autofocus – 93, texture – 93, noise – 89, artifacts – 84, and flash – 88. (L to R) Google Wifi, Google Chromecast Ultra, Google Home, Google Pixel XL, Google Pixel and Google Dreamview VR are displayed during the presentation of new Google hardware in San Francisco, California, U.S. October 4, 2016.REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach "With an overall DxOMark Mobile score of 89, pixel, the latest Google smartphone, is the highest-rated smartphone camera we have ever tested. Its image quality scores are impressive across the board, but it is particularly strong in providing a very high level of detail from its 12.3MP camera, with relatively low levels of noise for every tested lighting condition," wrote DxOMark, adding that it has fast autofocus and accurate exposures with exellent contrast and white balance. It went on to say that the device is an excellent choice for almost any kind of photography (both indoors and outdoors) despite some inconsistency in repeated autofocus, and artifacts in low-light shots. With an overall score of 89, the Google Pixel beats the likes of HTC 10, Samsung Galaxy S7 and Sony Xperia X Performance that got 89 in camera department. The Huawei P10, Moto Z Force Droid, Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus, Sony Xperia XZ, and Sony Xperia Z5 are next in line with a score of 87, while Apple iPhone 7, LG G5, Samsung Galaxy Note V, and Samsung S6 Edge have 86 points.

Google revealed it paid £36.4 million in UK corporation tax on pre-tax profits of £148.8 million in the year to June 30 2016 The firm came under fire from the Government last year for not paying its fair share to the exchequer and opposition politicians seized on the latest tax payment as a sign that the US tech giant was still not doing enough. Google insisted it paid "all the taxes due in the UK" but as an international firm it paid the majority of its taxes in its home country. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: "This revelation only further proves that Philip Hammond and Theresa May are more interested in cutting Google's taxes, than making sure they are paying their fair share. "It seems that the so called 'successful' tax deal with Google that George Osborne boasted about last year has meant that they are still not paying their fair share under his successor Philip Hammond. "We urgently need clarity on HM Revenue and Customs' relationship with Google and what reassurances have been provided to the company. "It is a national disgrace that by paying just £36 million in tax Google could have an effective tax rate lower than many working families in our country. And it exposes the complacency at the heart of this Tory Government, which is allowing this to still continue despite last year's scandal." Liberal Democrat treasury spokeswoman Baroness Kramer said: "It is appalling that Google are still getting away with paying such a paltry amount of their total revenue back in taxes. "Our worst fear is that the Tories would use Brexit to turn the UK into a tax haven sitting off the northern shores of Europe, there is no sign that this isn't where we are headed. "This Government is already struggling with the Brexit squeeze, if they want to stop cutting vital services they need to start picking up what is owed to the British people." Meg Hillier, chairwoman of the influential Commons Public Accounts Committee (PAC), said: " Yet again we see a large corporation paying a rate of tax that belies its significant presence and business transactions in the UK. "This is why the PAC is working internationally to press for greater tax transparency so that we can all see clearly how much tax corporations pay and where. "This latest tax contribution from Google just underlines why this is so important." The firm revealed it paid £36.4 million in UK corporation tax on pre-tax profits of £148.8 million in the year to June 30 2016. A Google spokesman said: "As an international business, we pay the majority of our taxes in our home country, as well as all the taxes due in the UK. "We have recently announced significant new investment in the UK, including new offices in Kings Cross for 7,000 staff." The tech company paid £46.2 million in corporation tax for the previous 18 months to June 30 2015. That covered an extra six months of business before Google moved to a 12-month accounting period the following year. Google said both administrative costs and turnover for the period decreased as a result of the accounting changes. Revenue dropped £141 million in the year to June 30 2016 to £1 billion, from just under £1.2 billion for the previous 18 months. The company has faced mounting pressure over its tax affairs amid a backlash against corporate tax avoidance by multi-national companies. Google agreed to a controversial £130 million deal with HM Revenue & Customs in January last year to settle a 10-year tax inquiry into its UK business. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) declined to comment on Google's tax payment, saying it did not discuss identifiable taxpayers. A spokesman said: "Everyone has to pay the tax due under the law and we do not settle for less. "Our most recent figures show that HMRC brought in a record £26 billion in extra tax for our public services, with £7.3 billion of that total coming from the 2,100 largest and most complex businesses in the UK."

But when it comes to some reputed and trusted tech companies, they easily get into people's minds with their 'new and latest offerings'. These, in most cases, would be hoax or joke offerings - those that will never exist, or those that will be available for a very short time just for laughs. Even before April 1, these companies start pushing their stories to goof around with you - with little teasers, such as the Dash Charge announcement that OnePlus had teased, before making briefly available the Dash Energy drink in select outlets Here are 2017's April Fools' tech pranks - the gimmicks, goofs, and pranks that companies decided to plan on us. Some are funny, some inane, and some lame. 1. Google Google has always been on the frontier of people, with quirky innovations that usually get people believe it. It has some bizarre-yet-believable innovations up its sleeve that come out to be some of the best April Fools' jokes, and some disasters. This time around, Google has unveiled a product that is not meant for you but your pets. That's right, your dogs and cats are the target users for Google's new product called 'Google Gnome' - the ultimate backyard ornament. The 'voice-activated, hands-free tool' is more than a speaker that can answer your queries like Google Home, but also a laser-equipped hedge trimmer. Separately, the company also released a new feature for pets on the Google app for iOS - users can use 3D Touch on the app icon or head to settings and select I'm Feeling Woof or I'm Feeling Meow to let your dogs and cats get info on topics they care about-whether that means squeaky toys or a bowl of milk. With I'm Feeling Woof and I'm Feeling Meow on the Google app, canines and felines alike can surf pet-friendly info with just a press of their paw." Your pup or cat needs to tap on 'I'm Feeling Woof' or 'I'm Feeling Meow' to get themselves topics and things that can cheer them up. Google has also introduced 'Google Play for Pets' to let your pets surf apps and games that can stimulate them. If it feels unreal to you, then you're right. It's another April Fools' joke from Google. Another April Fools' Day joke is inside Google Maps where users can play Ms. Pac-Man in any area that has enough roads along with multiple characters to navigate. Some users report the iOS version lets users pick the map, while Android takes you to randomized spots, notes The Verge. We'd seen Pac-Man on our Google Maps streets back in 2015. 2. Amazon We all know what Amazon's voice assistant Alexa is capable of doing, but this time the online retail giant has opened a new way of interaction between a digital assistant and your pets. Yes, that's right, pets again. Amazon Echo now comes with 'Petlexa' that understands animal language and does exactly what would seem fit for them. A dog can order milk from Amazon, a cat can order sushi from one of the 'Amazon restaurants'. "Petlexa gives pets the freedom to ask for food, place orders from Amazon, and activate smart home enabled toys," explains Amazon. "If your pets are shy to warm up to their new AI friend, try suggesting music by The Animals or an audiobook like Marley and Me on Audible." You can watch Amazon Echo with Petlexa right here. 3. Ola Indian companies are not far behind in playing pranks with their Indian customers on the April Fools' Day. Ola Cabs has launched a new service called 'Ola Wheels' that seeks to redefine commuting inside buildings. Ola Wheels are the electric scooters that can take you from one place to another if you are unable to move even a little bit, inside the premises. Ultra-short commute & voice based AI, the next level of mobility is here! Join us in welcoming #OlaWheels. https://t.co/pO6Eh7cbZT pic.twitter.com/HkMCpo6A4P— Ola (@Olacabs) April 1, 2017 "Wheels is integrated into the Ola App. Just open the 'Wheels' icon on the Ola app which will appear if you open the app. Even though he is still in Beta, we have covered a large number of corporate business zones for now and are looking to expand this very soon," explains Ola. There are also three tier plans for Ola Wheels - Wheels Reach, Wheels Rental, and Wheel Play. You can check out how Ola Wheels works and can take you from your bedroom to your kitchen right here. 4. Xiaomi Xiaomi India on April 1 shared a video on its Twitter channel, with CEO Lei Jun teasing a Mi Smart Motorcycle as due to launch soon in India.   5. Lyft The ride-hailing app company, Lyft has introduced a glove that is so powerful that it can summon Lyft cars and taxis right in front of you. You just have to wave your hand in the air. Called Lyft Mono, this smart glove makes you look like a superhero who had telekinesis capabilities - but also rather stupid at the same time. 6. Petco Petco is a pet supplies and accessories company - so it normally wouldn't be in our list. But it's come up with a tech accessory for pet owners - a drone. Petco has revealed a DooDoo Drone 3000 that can collect your dog's poop and dump it at the supposed place. It's available at a price of $19.99 starting April 1, 2017. Yes, it's the April Fools' Day and we know it's too good to be actually true. There's also an upcoming Petco Kitty Litter Flying Saucer. Those who are interested can check them out here. 7. Netflix, Hulu, and Roku We have had some exemplary shows to keep us hooked on Netflix. Then Netflix introduced its offline saving feature that enabled watching Netflix shows on-the-go. Now, Netflix seems to be introducing Netflix Live - a livestream of 'life's biggest thrills' featuring Will Arnett. It's a non-stop discussion on some of the ignored things in life like parallel parking, copy machines to keep you entertained on the April Fools' Day - if that's what your April 1 plan includes. Similarly, Roku and Hulu have their own versions of April Fools' Day prank right in front of us. Roku has introduced 'SnackSuggest' that is a new feature inside Roku devices and apps that will suggest snack pairing to any TV or movie you're watching. "Like a fine wine and cheese pairing, the goal of Roku SnackSuggest is to bring together your favorite entertainment with complementary snack suggestions that enhance and elevate your streaming appetite. You can even use Roku SnackSuggest with features such as private listening and night mode so your streaming spree can continue while everyone else goes to bed!" You can check Roku's snack-craving feature when you're binge-watching right here. Hulu, on the other hand, has introduced 'Hu: TV Abbreviated' that cuts an entire series like The Mindy Project to just eight second recaps. This looks impressive considering the time you would waste during an hour-long show. It also created some 11 videos to feature its 'Hulu Datr' service, which it called "the revolutionary free new app that will transform the way soul mates find one another. Press play on your love life." You can check them here. 8. Reddit Reddit's April Fools' Day joke hardly looks like a joke. It appears to be a social experiment named 'Reddit Place' which is a large white pixel canvas where a user can place coloured pixel every five minutes to create some entity or design of their choice. The canvas is already littered with creation attempts, a smorgasbord of slogans, epithets, inappropriate images, and more. You can check it out here at your own risk. 9. 'Sofia' Smart Sofa In today's world, when everything is becoming smart - why leave a sofa behind? Wayfair answered this question with a voice-driven smart sofa that can read out your calendar events to you, has built-in parental controls to daunt kids if they are recklessly jumping on it, can track your fitness data (basically much of the time you spend lying over it), and can even clean itself automatically. We know there are a lot more April Fools' Day prank being played, so if you came across any of them that hasn't been listed above, tell us in the comments below.

Toshiba has reportedly completed the first round of bidding for its prized memory chip business, seen as key for the cash-strapped company to turn itself around. Some 10 foreign companies and funds, including Google and Amazon, tendered bids, the mass-circulation Yomiuri Shimbun said, quoting unnamed sources. The two US tech giants are expected to use Toshiba's memory chips for their cloud services, the daily said. Taiwan's Hon Hai, which acquired Japanese electronics maker Sharp last year, has apparently bid more than 2 trillion yen ($18 billion), the daily said. Immediate confirmation of the report was not available. Toshiba shares jumped more than five percent on Friday after local media reported that bidders included Apple, US private-equity firm Silver Lake Partners and American chipmaker Broadcom. Toshiba is expected to negotiate with individual candidates this month. Local media said any foreign buyer would need to pass a Japanese government review, given concerns about security around systems already using Toshiba's memory chips. Toshiba is the world's number two supplier of memory chips for smartphones and computers, behind South Korea's Samsung, and the business accounted for about a quarter of its 5.67 trillion yen in revenue last fiscal year. The news report came after angry investors lambasted Toshiba executives at a shareholders meeting over its warning that annual losses could balloon to more than $9.0 billion. The red ink is largely tied to huge cost overruns and construction delays at its US nuclear power unit Westinghouse Electric, which filed for bankruptcy protection late March.

It was on this day, April 1, 2004, that Google chose to introduce Gmail. By: FE Online | Published: April 1, 2017 5:46 PM The multi-billion dollar company had once stated that pigeons played the catalyst in its search technology and some other stuff like starting a research centre on the moon.(Reuters) Life is difficult to imagine without Gmail. It was on this day, April 1, 2004, that Google chose to introduce Gmail. And just like the rest of us don’t believe any big news on the first of April, nobody did in 2004. A CNN report from 2004 says that Google claimed to have a storage limit of 1 Gigabyte. And it did not help that Google had developed a reputation for being a prankster in the tech community. The multi-billion dollar company had once stated that pigeons played the catalyst in its search technology and some other stuff like starting a research centre on the moon. According to USA Today, despite Jonathan Rosenberg (vice president of the products group at Google)’s statement about being serious about the release, speculations were running high about how this was one of Google’s classic jokes. ON Slash.org, which used to call itself a news service for geeks, had a poster which stated that this was going down as one of the biggest pranks ever pulled by anyone is history. Gmail was almost too good to be true. The email service had been advertised flash ads or image banner-free zone. All the ads Gmail had were relevant text messages. The promise of a 1GB free storage was unbelievably large by the normal 2004 standards. Also watch: But even Gmail wasn’t free of legal troubles. Google used ads based on the contents of email messages and it drew more flak than Google had anticipated. While a few people thought that it was a direct invasion of privacy of the sender, few others felt that the recipient was having his/her rights violated. According to Time, people would see medicine ads next to suicidal texts. People had started talking about all the possible privacy invasions, like rumours on a dining table. Responding to the petitions and blogs against it, Google had released a statement saying that such misinformation had the potential to threaten legitimate and necessary consumer choices by means of legislation while taking away people’s attention from the actual inherent privacy issues.

After quick updates like the LG G5 Android Nougat release, things have slowed down. Many are excitedly awaiting it to arrive, and here we’ll be going over everything owners need to know. From release schedules, confirmations and more. Including the LG G4 Nougat release. Way back in August last year Google rolled out Android 7.0 Nougat. Since then we’ve seen multiple quick maintenance updates, including 7.1.2 for the Pixel. Those with LG smartphone though, aren’t getting updates as quick. Read: Android 7.1 Nougat vs Android 6.0: What’s New Thanks to an LG Nougat preview program updates have been faster this time around. However, millions of those with an LG G4 or V10 are still waiting. Additionally, some LG G5 owners are still on Marshmallow, and are wondering when they’ll get the latest and greatest software. That and more is detailed below for all LG smartphone owners. Popular smartphones from all major manufacturers will see updates to Android 7.0 in the near future, if not already. Reports have surfaced from Samsung, LG, HTC, Sony and many others. Manufacturers are pushing out Android 7.0 though, and not the latest 7.1.1 release by Google. That will come later this year. Owners with the LG G4, LG G5, LG V10, budget devices and potentially even the older LG G3 will get Android 7.0 Nougat. Some already have. And while LG has been relatively quiet, we’re starting to see more movement. In fact, some benchmark results were spotted with the LG G3 running Nougat. A device that’s nearly two years old. That’s a good sign for owners, but don’t expect it anytime soon. If you have a G4 or V10 though, we have some relatively good news to share. The LG G4 Nougat Update is coming soon With that said, when will your LG device get Android Nougat? We’re not entirely sure, but we have some details worth sharing. Here’s the latest news on LG Android 7.0 Nougat updates, what’s new and more. LG Android 7.0 Nougat Updates The first smartphone to ship with Android 7.0 Nougat was the LG V20. As a result many expected LG to be one of the first for software updates too. On November 8th LG confirmed the LG G5 Android 7.0 update had begun. However, it didn’t arrive for those in the United States until far later, and most didn’t get it until February. A few are even waiting as we’re now in March. On November 8th the LG G5 Android 7.0 update began in Korea. LG confirmed it would soon arrive in the United States, Asia, then continue to other popular markets around the globe. The first update in the United States arrived on November 21st. Beginning with the Sprint LG G5. Several users on Reddit confirmed the news, then eventually Sprint made it official. The T-Mobile LG G5 Android 7.0 Nougat update quickly followed, and then the Verizon LG G5 update kicked off in December. Below is a screenshot confirming the software, November 1st security patch, and the large 1.3GB file. Here’s a screenshot for proof. The T-Mobile LG G5 Android 7.0 update is now available So what about AT&T? They’ve been fast with updates in the past, but that wasn’t the case this time around with the LG G5. AT&T is the last major carrier to send out G5 Nougat updates, which began February 20th. Multiple reports online have confirmed its arrival. Head into Settings > About Phone > and check for updates. Remember, AT&T only allows users to check once per day. Otherwise you’ll need to change the phone date forward and try again. It can take up to two weeks to hit your device, so by now most should have it. Next, LG will continue their efforts on the LG V10 and LG G4. When though, is a complete mystery. Originally we heard February and March, but that obviously didn’t happen. However, we do have new information. Reports from Korea say to expect the LG G4 Android 7.1 Nougat update in Q3, which seems way too late. Same goes for the LG V10, which could see it this summer. These are only rumors though, and we’re expecting LG to get these out within the next 1-2 months at the latest. When we know more we’ll share all the details.  The V20 needs a bug-fixing update too, as it has its fair share of problems with Nougat. Surprisingly, select LG G3 phones have been spotted with Nougat. And while it’s possible it may receive an update, the phone is nearly two years old. Meaning it may only get security and maintenance updates, not the new software. We’ll have to wait and see. What’s New in Android 7.0 Nougat At the top of the page LG owners can find an in-depth breakdown of Android 7.0 Nougat, how it compares to older software and everything that’s new. Of course LG has a lot of changes to the look and feel of our software, but it is a great place to start for owners. As a quick recap, the LG Android 7.0 update will bring improvements across the board. From performance, battery life enhancements, improved split-screen multitasking and other changes. Google has over 50+ changes in Android N. Like faster app installs, which are also smaller, a new JIT compiler, improved graphics and performance with the Vulkan API, and even streamlined notifications with new quick reply controls. Not to mention customizable quick setting tiles and other things. Expect all of that and much more from LG Nougat updates. A big addition to Android announced back at Google IO was “Instant Apps” which enables our devices to install small bits of an app (from a search result or web link) and allow one-time instant app usage. Giving smartphone users an app-like experience without downloading anything or leaving the web. Android just adds what it needs for that moment, and removes it once we’re done with the app. Here is more information on Instant Apps, which is now available for select Nougat devices. Most of this will come with LG’s software skin on top, and closely resemble the sleeker UI we’ve seen on the LG V20. Samsung has TouchWiz, HTC uses Sense UI, etc. Don’t expect everything from Nexus or Pixel devices, but most of Android 7.0 Nougat will soon enhance your LG device. Additionally, the Google Assistant is rolling out to any and all smartphones on Android 6.0 Marshmallow or 7.0 Nougat. It should be on most phones by now, or soon. Final Thoughts As of today the LG V20 and LG G5 are the only LG devices on Android Nougat. Others will follow in the near future. Now that the final US carrier is sending out Nougat to the LG G5, we should start to hear more about the V10 and G4 from 2016. We know they are next, it’s just a matter of when. Hopefully the Q3 launch rumor is wrong. It’s worth nothing that most of LG’s updates have arrived in February or March the year after Google releases an update. Like The LG G3 Android 5.0 update arrived March a few years back. Considering the G5 was in December the company is a few months ahead of schedule. If that’s anything to go by we could see LG G4 Nougat updates in April. Stay tuned for more details, and we’ll update the moment we know more. 7 Responses 11/09/2016 Danny Jacobovitz Reply I’d be happy if my 2 devices running Marshmallow would get update 6.0.1!

Android O [Photo: courtesy of Google] By Jared Newman04.01.17 | 8:00 am Like most operating system upgrades, Google’s upcoming Android O has plenty of incremental improvements, such as picture-in-picture for video, autofill for forms, and optimizations for battery life. But beyond those useful tweaks, the update introduces some weirder ideas about how we might interact with Android in the future, not just on phones and tablets, but on PC-style devices and possibly wearables. Although Android O won’t launch until later this year–and probably won’t be widely adopted by phone makers until much later–the current developer preview provides a lot to think about in the meantime. Windows That Float Though it barely got a mention in Google’s introductory blog post, one of Android O’s most intriguing changes is a feature called “app overlay windows.” This is basically a way for apps to show pop-up windows on top of whatever the user is currently doing. Pop-up windows aren’t entirely new to Android. Facebook’s Android app, for instance, introduced floating messages tabs called “Chat Heads” four years ago, and the Brave browser lets users hide web pages in circular icons, which can be dragged around the screen while using other apps. But the feature was never well-documented, and Google discouraged its use for anything besides system-level interactions (such as a low battery warning). The Brave browser lets you hide web pages within floating bubbles. With Android O, developers believe Google is warming to the pop-up concept, adding some user-friendly elements such as automatic resizing and positioning of windows to reduce clutter and manage resources. This could make phones and tablets more useful as productivity machines. (Thankfully, the feature will still require permission from users, presumably to prevent its abuse.) Adaptive icons display in a variety of shapes across different device models. “While this has been possible on Android before … the implementation was a bit of a hack,” says Rastislav Vaško, the head of Android development for Todoist, in an email. “O brings ‘official’ support for this, so we’ll surely think about possible use cases for Todoist, although we don’t have any concrete plans yet.” Aaron Sarazan, the lead Android engineer at Capital One, also believes they’re another of convergence for Android and Chromebooks. Although Google has denied that the two operating systems will fully merge, the company is bringing them closer together with Android apps running on Chromebooks. “As Android expands onto every device imaginable, it’s only logical that it will eventually find its way back to the PC/laptop form factor,” Sarazan says. “Free floating windows are the first step to accomplishing that.” More Screens Floating windows aren’t the only way Google could be thinking beyond the phone. Android O also adds official support for multiple displays, letting users move apps between screens and resizing the window to fit. Todoist’s Vaško notes that this is a natural extension of multi-window support, a feature of last year’s Android Nougat upgrade that lets two apps run next to one another on the same screen. Apps that support multi-window today should automatically work with multiple displays under Android O, Vaško says. It’s unclear what types of multi-screen devices Google has in mind, but Samsung did just announce a dock for its Galaxy S8 smartphone that effectively turns it into a lightweight PC. Although Samsung’s version runs on the current version of Android, multi-screen support in Android O could allow any device maker to launch something similar. Samsung’s DeX Station turns the Galaxy S8 into a desktop PC. Steve Cary, Slack’s senior engineering manager for Android, says he has no idea what Google is up to, but he’s intrigued either way. “As our pocket devices become more and more powerful, it’s easy to think of a future where, for many job functions, you’d no longer need to carry a laptop around, but could just take your device out of your pocket and plug into an external monitor, mouse, keyboard, et cetera,” Cary says via email. “I’d use that!” Other possibilities include dual-screen smartphones or tablets. Or proper dual-monitor support for Chrome OS computers. Or, Vaško says, Google might just be putting the technology out there to see what happens. “They’re adding this capability, because it’s a natural extension of multi-window, added in N,” he says. “And they’ll let the partners and OEMs figure out interesting form factors.” A New Approach to Notifications Android O is also taking a stab at fighting notification overload with “Notification Channels.” This allows app makers to separate alerts into categories that appear under Android’s notification settings. A sports app like ESPN, for instance, might have separate alert toggles for news and score updates, while a messaging app could let users turn on notifications only for a specific conversation group. Essentially, Google is trying to expose granular notification controls that today are buried within each app’s own settings menu. “To me, the added controls simply make what was a big hammer (completely turning off all notifications from an app) into a selection of smaller hammers (completely turning off notifications of a particular type),” Slack’s Cary says. Android O introduces the concept of groups of notifications. While Notification Channels may not seem like a radical change, it could have a profound impact on smartwatches, which largely serve as fitness and notification machines. The Android Wear companion app already includes a way to silence an app’s notifications, but it’d be a lot more useful if people could decide exactly what types of notifications to get. That would only be possible if Android has granular controls at the system level. To speculate a bit more, Google could go further and add attributes that are common across multiple apps. A user might decide, for instance, to only receive notifications that are work-related, or to only get alerted about direct mentions from social media apps like Facebook or Twitter. While that’s not possible in Android O, moving more notification controls to the system level could be a step in that direction. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Although Android O is due out in the third quarter of this year, phone makers tend to dally on supporting new versions of the software. The most popular version of Android right now is Marshmallow, which arrived in 2015, and the most recent update, Android 7.1 “Nougat,” is only on 0.4% of devices. It’ll be a while until most app makers start supporting the wild ideas that Google has laid out.

Don't get your hopes set you'll be able to take home one of these outlandish products. &lt;br _moz_dirty="" /&gt; Google  Smart homes? Google is doubling down on smart gnomes. The Google Gnome device will give homeowners the "connected yard" of their dreams. Just walk outside and speak your command, and Google's army of helper gnomes will come to the rescue. You can find the device in the Google Store or the Made by Google site.  © Provided by CNBC Google Maps If you don't need to get to your destination in a hurry, Google Maps added a Ms. Pac-Man mode to further distract you from your task at hand. To play, open your Google Maps app and click on the pink Ms. Pac-Man icon on the right side of the screen. The idea is recycled from 2015's Pac-Man integration, but hey, if it isn't broke, then don't fix it.  Chegg Education technology company has released a new energy drink called "Chugg." Powered by "a c*** ton of caffeine" and "ground up unicorn horns," alleged testimonials claim you can down this drink, not sleep for 72 hours and write an entire thesis. &lt;br _moz_dirty="" /&gt; Honda Ok, Honda isn't a tech company, but this is pretty good. Instead of your standard honk, "Honda Horn Emojis" will play a themed tune appropriately tied to a illustrated expression button on your steering wheel. Hulu Don't have time to watch your favorite show? Hulu's Hu abbreviates not only its name, but shortens episodes into eight seconds (or slightly more) to capture your fleeting attention. &lt;br _moz_dirty="" /&gt; T-Mobile You'll never go without service when you're wearing your T-Mobile ONEsie. Slip on this wearable tech made from nano technology and you'll be fully covered, whether through full bars service or literally all-over fitness tracking. &lt;br _moz_dirty="" /&gt; Prysm Telecommuting has evolved, thanks to the Prysm Avatar. Send your drone to work, and it will project a full-sized hologram of you in your office. Wardrobe options include a "programmer" t-shirt look, a "Silicon Valley" hoodie outfit, and a business casual suit.

Here is a roundup of the best ones. Kukil Bora   April 1, 2017 17:08 IST Here is a roundup of the best tech gags for April Fools' Day 2017International Business Times, India April Fools' Day is back again with a bunch of goofs and gags to dupe the netizens. Keeping the tradition alive, various internet companies are rolling out a ton of different pranks to play tricks on their users. Since this year's April Fools' Day falls on a Saturday, many companies came up with their jokes a few days early. So, if you spot anything today that sounds weird or too good to believe, we suggest you to give it a second thought.  Here is a roundup of the best tech gags that are worthy of your attention. As always, Google dominates the list. Ms. Pac-Man on Google Maps Ms. Pac-Man on Google Maps for April Fools' Day 2017.Kukil Bora / International Business Times, India In this case, pranksters at Google have rehashed an old idea for 2017. We had played Pac-Man on Google Maps in 2015; so this time it's Ms. Pac-Man, who is running around at random locations in the world while trying to out-eat the ghosts. Google Gnome We all know about Google Home, the voice-activated speaker powered by the Google Assistant which takes care of stuff inside the home. But what about outside? Here is Google Gnome at your service. We don't know why Google treats this as a gag, but a Google Home variant customised for the outdoors is something that many would love to pay for, especially if it is smart enough to say that "we're all compost" and "almost everything is made up of organic matter, and will return to organic matter." Google Wind Google has a solution for the annoying rainy days in the Netherlands. Its local team has upgraded some of the traditional windmills with control modules connected to Google Cloud Platform, and is now launching Google Wind. The company wants you to believe that these are "machine learning windmills that can blow away clouds so you don't have to sing "Rain Rain Go Away." Google Bubble Wrap Keyboard If you love to pop bubble wraps to release stress, Google Japan has something for you to offer – a light bubble wrap keyboard which you can pop and type. There's more. You can also fill in scented air in the bubbles. Isn't it satisfying? Amazon Petlexa Would you believe it if we told you that your pet dog may have been longing for its own version of Amazon Alexa? Well, Amazon believes it is, and therefore has introduced Petlexa to help your pet better interact with Echo at home. We bet your dog will love this. T-Mobile ONEsie T-Mobile has discovered the perfect blend of fashion and wearable technology. It believes that the tiny Fitbit band on your wrist is not enough to monitor all the complexities of your body. So the solution for this is the new T-Mobile ONEsie, a 4G LTE-enabled bodysuit that will turn you into a human hotspot and will literally stop you from eating food high in cholesterol.

You can now control your Wink-connected thermostats and lighting products from Google Home Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/03/28 9:00am PDTMar 28, 2017 10 Plus 1 on G+ 23 Share on Facebook 39 Share on Twitter Total Shares72 Google News When Google renamed Brillo to "Android Things" at the end of the last year, it also announced new partners for Google Home. Beside Hue and SmartThings, there would be Belkin WeMo, Honeywell, Wink, LiFX, and TP-Link. The first two are already live in the Home Control section of Google Home's Assistant settings, and the third should be available starting today. Wink makes a home hub that works as a central control place and bridge between all of your connected gadgets. The Hub 2, which I reviewed a few months ago, has WiFi, Bluetooth, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and plenty of other protocols to communicate with many smart home products. As I discovered, it's also very easy to set up and one of the simplest ways to start building your connected smart home without feeling overwhelmed. As long as the product you choose is supported by Wink, there will be clear requirements, tutorials, and graphics for you. Plus, previously, you could trigger Wink Shortcuts with OK Google (before Assistant was announced), but that hasn't been working for months. However, starting today, you should be able to control some Wink products from Google Home and Assistant. To add Wink to your list of controllable devices, you can head over to Home Control in your Google Home app, tap the + button, select Wink, log in with your username and password, and you're set. All your lights and thermostats will be listed and you can group them together if needed. Use commands like "turn bedroom light on," "set living room light to 50%," "turn up the temperature by 5 degrees," or "set living room thermostat to 70 degrees," to control your gadgets. Screenshots from the Home app on iOS. Everything should be the same on Android. Like Wink's Amazon Alexa integration, this only works for thermostats and lighting products (switches, bulbs, plugs, dimmers), so it looks like you won't be able to lock your door or raise your blinds with voice commands just yet. You can still do a lot though if you use smart plugs for some of your electronics and appliances, like starting the coffee machine or turning off the crockpot. I'm very excited about this option finally being live: my Google Home should be here soon and I can't wait to try all these commands. In the meantime, I've checked the Google Assistant settings and Wink doesn't show up yet for me under the list of products I can add, but it could be a server-side switch or a slow rollout. One thing worth noting about Wink: the app doesn't require a Wink Hub to function and some third-party gadgets don't require it either. For example, I was able to create an account, add my Canary camera (see: no Wink Hub under requirements), and switch security modes from the Wink app months before I got the Hub 2. That's to say that maybe, you could add some thermostats to the Wink app and control them from your Google Home without requiring a Hub. I stress on maybe, because I don't have any product to test it with. I'm sure it wouldn't work with Z-Wave lights and switches, because that requires the hub to issue the commands, but cloud-controlled gadgets should technically be within limits. In this case, I'd say the Ecobee3 and Carrier Côr and Emerson Sensi thermostats, and the iHome Smart Plug could work with Google Home without the Wink Hub, provided you create a Wink account and add them there first. It's worth trying if you have one of these, because this might be one of the only ways you can have native control over them from Google Home without relying on IFTTT.

It's under Services, not Home Control. Works much better than IFTTT integration. lels h Now I really regret not getting in on that deal best buy and amazon just had on em. :( whynot7474 I hope this is true so I can get rid of the many IFTTT applets I have for my Harmony. gizak Don't see it showing up on my Home app yet...but ya, I'm using it by bridging the two with IFTTT. While I enjoy being able to create my own trigger phrases, I'm still bummed that Logitech only lets you start and stop scenes, ie: saying "let's play a game" will turn on TV, turn on receiver, turn on PS4, and also change the TV and/or Receiver to correct inputs. BUT, i can't say a command to do individual things, like "change to channel 5", "set volume to 10", "change input to Xbox"... whynot7474 So first, Harmony is supported on the Home now....I just found it under services and linked my account. This will let you do everything you did with IFTTT and then some....like changing channels, changing the volume, etc. However, you could actually still change channels using IFTTT, it's just a little cumbersome to set up because you have to set up favorite channels, then have a separate IFTTT app for each channel. It's a pain, but it was a good workaround until Home supported Harmony. Ed G Nice! Just got all my lights assigned. I thought I'd be waiting a long time for this to arrive.

By Jason Ward Tuesday, Mar 28, 2017 at 1:00 pm EDT 226 Comments Jason L Ward is a columnist at Windows Central. He provides unique big picture analysis of the complex world of Microsoft. Jason takes the small clues and gives you an insightful big picture perspective through storytelling that you won't find anywhere else. Seriously, this dude thinks outside the box. Follow him on Twitter at @JLTechWord. He's doing the "write" thing! One thing that irks many passionate Windows phone fans more than almost anything else is Microsoft's apparent lack of passion for its mobile platform. Whether there is or was an actual lack of passion from Microsoft is irrelevant. As a company that hoped for a broad consumer embrace of Windows phones, the perception of disinterest from Microsoft was just as detrimental as an actual lack of the same. Windows phone fans who accuse Microsoft of a less than optimal affection for its mobile efforts often cite a lack of marketing. This accusation certainly seems valid considering what we've seen (and haven't seen) in the way of advertising of Windows phones. This perception is particularly apparent when we consider the amount of marketing that comes from far more successful smartphone makers such as Apple and Samsung. But marketing takes many forms, and if you ask Microsoft, it would likely argue the company did invest liberally in marketing Windows phones, just not in the manner one would expect. We'll look at those other marketing methods in this piece and consider if in hindsight Microsoft might do things differently to market its ultimate mobile device: the ultramobile Surface PC. The face of in-your-face marketing You can't forget what never leaves your field of view. Microsoft's competition seems to subscribe to this belief, but Microsoft itself has not embraced that philosophy. Beautiful, well-crafted, seducing iPhone and Samsung Galaxy ads have consistently graced our television screens for years. Knowing that thousands of consumers were being lured into the Apple and Google ecosystems by these seductive ads has been a pain point for Window phone fans. We've been forced to helplessly watch as unrelenting marketing from entrenched market leaders yielded greater market and mindshare for those companies. Many people have concluded that those same efforts, combined with Microsoft's lack of equally consistent investments, led to the decreased market share and mindshare of Windows phones. Lest we forget, Microsoft did come out of the gates running. Early in Windows Phone 7 history, even up to Windows Phone 8, Microsoft and its carrier partners peppered memorable Windows phones ads on TV. This Lumia 1020 commercial is a classic: Those highly visible television spots were less consistent than the persistent flow of ads from rivals Apple and Samsung. Compared to those rivals' connected tapestry of ads that communicated a consistent narrative to consumers, Microsoft's sporadic TV spots were like a collection of disconnected "short stories" that struggled to connect with consumers. Consistency matters. A lack of consistency, therefore, precludes the establishment of a sound foundation. Choosing your battles By the time Microsoft entered the space with its attention-getting attempts, its rivals were entrenched, and consumers were deeply invested in Apple's and Google's ecosystems. The millions of dollars rivals were pouring into television ads were reaffirming messages to the already-converted masses and pulling others into the fold. Perhaps Microsoft deemed the costs of fighting a battle for the iPhone- and Android phone-focused minds of the masses via costly TV spots too risky an endeavor. No one knew about Microsoft's mobile platform with the unique tiled interface, after all. Consequently, Microsoft's television ad campaign strategy would have had to be a persistent, long-lasting and very expensive three-pronged endeavor. First Microsoft would have had to build awareness for a virtually unknown platform in a "noisy" space where consumers didn't think another viable platform existed. Secondly, Microsoft would have had to educate consumers via succinct (approximately 30 seconds) but effective ads about the merits of its unique platform. Third, in a space where consumers only wanted iPhones and Android phones, Microsoft would have had to persuade users that Windows phones were a better option. Microsoft likely calculated a war of TV ads a lost cause. To pry users' hearts and minds from the ads that reaffirmed what they had already embraced with ads that would garner their enduring attention would have required profound creativity and dedication. If rival companies were not already entrenched, and consumers were not already thoroughly aware of and invested in those ecosystems, and Microsoft's efforts did not require building awareness of and educating the masses about an unknown entity, Redmond may have pursued more aggressive television campaigns. Given what Microsoft was up against, however, it likely deemed the probability of success for an ad campaign of that magnitude too low to commit to investing the necessary resources. Thus, Microsoft focused its marketing efforts elsewhere. Connecting products as a marketing strategy During Microsoft's Convergence 2015 event, Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) Chris Capossela shared his marketing strategy: ... my second transformation agenda item for Microsoft is this notion of using our amazing innovation engineering resource pool to build marketing into our products. Capossela shared Microsoft's attempts to mimic the success Apple and Google achieved by building marketing into their products. This strategy is designed to lead to an interconnection of products where the use of one product would give rise to the use of another. The following graphic is a snapshot in time. The size of the circles represents how many people were using a particular company's product, and the lines represent the connections between products. Yellow represents Apple, purple Google, and blue Microsoft. Clearly, the crisscrossing network of yellow and purple lines reflect that both Apple and Google succeeded in building connections that lead users from one of the respective company's products to another. Capossela acknowledged how in the U.S., Apple needed only to advertise the iPhone and iPad, and that was sufficient to ensure a user buy-in to Apple's broader ecosystem. Microsoft's clearly-disconnected graph represented a profound need to improve interconnections between its products and services. Capossela said the following: And the beautiful thing about having lots of lines is that you don't have to market all of your products. You only market the locomotives. And then when someone uses your locomotive, it pulls along the cabooses. Build marketing into its products, then acquire, engage and enlist Any Windows phone fan at any stage in the platform's history would agree that Microsoft needed to acquire more Windows phone users. Fans who have bemoaned the lack of aggressive television ad campaigns would certainly agree. They would argue that massive financial investments at the first stage of Capossela's "acquisition, engage and enlist" marketing strategy were necessary. There was even a time when Capossela would have agreed. Acquire Capossela stated the following: How much marketing should I put at the top on acquire, how much should I put in engage, how much should I put in enlist? Think to yourself, if you were spending a dollar on this business, where would you spend it in the funnel? I think most people would say acquire, and that's what I said in the beginning. The reality is we have no issue with acquisition, zero. Tons of people know the brand. I can do a press release, and all of a sudden, 'Oh my gosh, Office is on the iPhone, let me go download Word and Excel and PowerPoint.' Capossela used Microsoft's release of Office for the iPhone and Android, which resulted in tens of thousands of immediate downloads because users knew the brand, as an example. No marketing required. Millions of people use Windows PCs and Microsoft services. People knew the brand. Windows phones were another product in this broadly accepted and deeply integrated, personal and professional ecosystem. Consequently, the company chose a marketing strategy as part of which it hoped to leverage the Microsoft and Windows brands and the integration of the phone in its broadly accepted ecosystem of products and services rather than the heavy marketing of Windows phones at the "acquisition" stage. Microsoft likely perceived Windows as the "locomotive" that would pull the Windows phone "caboose" forward. Engage Microsoft chose to "connect the product lines," such as an initial exclusivity of Cortana on Windows phones. Fans may remember Group Program Manager for Cortana Marcus Ash asserting Cortana exclusivity on Windows phones as a draw to the platform. Other connections were the company's promotion of a default inclusion of Office on Windows phones and limited integration with Xbox games. Given the advantage of hindsight, such a heavy dependence on "engaging" users as a primary marketing method with so little effort at the acquisition stage may have been a naïve miscalculation on Microsoft's part. Microsoft may have overcalculated the strength of its brand in relation to what investments would have been needed to break significantly into the mobile space. Perhaps a more balanced approach would have led to greater success. Especially because Microsoft's strategy also includes bringing the breadth of its software and services to competing platforms, which undercuts exclusivity advantages Windows phones would otherwise have had. Marketing, it's in there Capossela shared how Microsoft seeks to use engineering to build marketing into its products and expend less money on marketing: It's using a resource that we have a lot of, engineering at Microsoft, and it's counterbalancing a resource that we frankly want to spend less on, marketing, in order to get people to experience the full ecosystem and fill out those lines on that blue, purple, orange chart, to really compete ecosystem to ecosystem as opposed to product to product. The Surface, Surface pen and OneNote integration is a great example of how Microsoft leadership got various teams to work together to achieve such a high level of product cohesion. Now that Devices Chief Panos Panay and the Surface team are building Microsoft's ultimate mobile device, can we expect a similar cohesion of current innovations, such as mixed reality and digital inking? Could Microsoft have done more with Windows phones in the past? Capossela stated: One of the things we realized immediately is marketing dollars spent around engagement can be effective, but actually product design is far more effective at getting people to be deeply engaged in your products. That statement assures us of both Microsoft's investments in quality design and of the company's desire to minimize marketing dollars. Apple's and Samsung's philosophies seem to embrace Microsoft's vision for quality of design but also a less reserved approach to aggressive financial investments in marketing. As Microsoft learned from Apple's and Google's integration of services, perhaps a lesson can be gleaned about more liberal marketing expenditures in time for the debut of the ultramobile Surface PC. Enlist The final stage of Capossela's marketing strategy is enlisting. It is at this stage that diehard Windows phone loyalists play an active role. It is also the stage that costs Microsoft nothing in the way of marketing. In fact, it is to this stage that any company hopes to transition a sizable portion of its user base. Apple and Google have acquired, engaged and enlisted hordes of fans who, through word of mouth and other means, passionately advocate for those platforms. The millions of Windows phone fans who make up the less than one percent of the smartphone market are a vocal, passionate but faint whisper among the thunderous rumbles of the competition's enlisted fans. Caposella shared the following about how Microsoft views its fans: Then we figure out what a fan looks like, what is someone who loves our stuff, is loyal to our stuff, and we can enlist them to talk about how they use our products, we can enlist them to be a voice piece, a better voice piece of our company, even though they don't work for our company. Microsoft obviously failed to acquire and engage a relevant number of Windows phone fans. One may wonder how Microsoft might have been able to use its fan base to promote Windows phones if the company had achieved a more impressive measure of success. As it stands now, the company's Insider Program and the program's leader Dona Sarkar are clearly meant to keep fans engaged, and through software build releases keep them talking about the platform. Without the Insider Program, the hopes of many Windows phone fans would have long withered away, and with them, Microsoft's free marketing resource of enlisted fans. History is the best teacher When Microsoft reenters the mobile space, it won't be with a smartphone but (presumably) with an ultramobile Surface PC. As a PC first, with telephony attributes, it will not be positioned to compete directly with smartphones, though it will overlap the smartphone space. This ultramobile Surface PC will be a category-defining device that Microsoft will need to introduce to the masses proactively. Hopefully, the company will have learned from past mistakes that a more balanced marketing approach of television ads combined with the integration of services is more effective than an overreliance on one method over the other. The fact that the ultramobile Surface PC will be part of the Surface family bodes well for the product. Microsoft has been far more aggressive about its advertisements, promotions, partnerships and product placements of Surface PCs than it has been for its phones. Microsoft's confidence in both its Surface brand and its PCs is evident. Smartphones, however, have been the company's Achilles heel. Will Microsoft execute more balanced marketing for its ultimate mobile device? It will be interesting to see if Microsoft will combine its confidence in its Surface brand and PC prowess with a more balanced approach to the marketing of the ultramobile PC. Microsoft has learned from competitors how to engineer marketing into its products. But has the company learned that for certain product categories, television marketing campaigns are likely a necessary supplement to its existing marketing?

Skip TV ads. Go digital with ads on facebook, linkedin, instagram, pinterest, snapchat, and twitter. 2. Put a free Surface cell in the hands of every Microsoft and carrier partner employee. Theirs to keep. 3. Hire secret shoppers and let all retail employees know they're out there. $50 cash on the spot to employees who ask if they've seen the new Surface phone. Another $50 if they post on social media about getting the bonus (so other employees will know it's real). 4. Co-marketing. When I go to ATT's website, I see big slide show images of the latest Samsung or iPhone device they offer. Where's the Surface phone? This is co-marketing. Microsoft pays the carriers to feature their phones. It's not a concept with which Microsoft seems too familiar. 5. Discount volume purchases. If a company has decided to kill BYOD and issue phones, offer discounts just as is done with volume licensing for Microsoft software. 6. I don't know if it's a US thing or a California thing, but here, you have 14 days to return a phone and cancel the purchase. Microsoft should announce they don't think 2 weeks is long enough to fall in love. Offer a 3-month "we'll buy it back, no questions asked" guarantee that you'll love the Surface phone. I spotted a Surface 2-in-1 in Matt Czuchry's hands on the 1st episode of Netflix original Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life. Obviously paid placement. But episodes 2-4? All Macs and iPhones. Who dropped the ball on this one? Same goes for early seasons of House of Cards. Frank Underwood had a Windows phone. This is product placement. Microsoft should learn more about it. 0 3 days ago Reply chokiyumi Excellent article Jason! Love your writing style and passion, never boring ^_^. Microsoft needs to strongly focus in advertising their coming line of "surface phone" or ultra mobil pc within the professional/business market. As a counselor, I rely on Windows to get all of my work done. Whether is progress notes at the office, using my surface tablet for demonstration of relaxation techniques to my patients, or doing extra work from my 950xl on the go, such as finishing notes on word or sending my weekly invoice to billing using Excel. I have used pixel c tablet and nexus 6p...true, they are capable of doing what I can do on windows but they lack the raw power of getting things done the way it was meant to be. With apple, same story. People these days have accustomed to the routine of a phone device that has a nice camera, an app store (which 90% of the apps are garbage, money stealing, spyware, and waste of time) and has a brand name that "makes you cool owning one". It is a sad reality and perhaps there is nothing wrong with it. However, Microsoft has so much to offer, why try to compete in such world? Their focus should not be a common mainstream but a professional and reliable mainstream... How? By not comparing it to what is already out there. It needs to advertise it as a category of it's own. As a powerful machine that nothing else out there could be compared to it. By giving productive people a reason to think twice about what a true mobile device can do. Also, I came across an article about the future of apps. It seems like applications are expensive to maintain to companies likes Bank of America, etc. And so they prefer people to use their mobile version of their .com. In a near future, not too far away, perhaps apps will truly disappear in favor of mobile version with quick access, no update required and doesn't take space in your memory. In a world like that, the ultra mobile pc or "surface phone" will truly shine. 0 3 days ago Reply chokiyumi Excellent article Jason! Love your writing style and passion, never boring ^_^.

It's biggest differentiator was continuum and it seems like Samsung beat them to it in terms of functionality. You will have access to the play store, which Microsoft unfortunately doesn't have the access to. You will get a premium handset with great craftsmanship. I know someone is gonna say "lagdroid" but honestly those people probably haven't touched an Android phone since 2012. My S7 edge flies in comparison anything Windows 10 Mobile has put out. To add insult to injury, Microsoft themselves are helping Samsung by developing software for their desktop experience.

Windows Phone/Mobile is over. 0 3 days ago Reply Sin Ogaris No. 0 3 days ago Reply chuckdaly I never bought into the argument that Microsoft launched Windows Phone too late. Plenty of people still had yet to buy their first smartphone, and ecosystem/app investment simply is vastly overhyped since we all know more people who have owned a smartphone from more than one ecosystem, than those that have only owned a device from a single ecosystem. Windows Phones had great ads, such as the "The smartphone beta test.. " or the "Smoked by Windows phone". So I don't believe it was marketing. Not was carrier salesmen ignoring WP isn't actually a marketing issue either. The problem, like with many other Microsoft products, they simply failed to follow through. MS expects third parties developers and hardware manufacturers to carry their products to market dominance without a full commitment of first party development beyond the first year or two. Sounds a lot like what happened to W10M, right? Granted, Windows Phone, in particular, died from the constant OS reboots, that killed off over half it's userbase everytime. 0 3 days ago Reply erasure25 If it doesn't have VR/AR, 3D, biometrics, 4k capable, mobile payment, Qi, then its DOA regardless of marketing... 0 3 days ago Reply osurickbee Nice article!

Advertsing is the last piece of the puzzle. You need a good Product, it needs to be Packaged right, Positioned and Priced right too. MS has a different product (W10 OS), lousy packaging (compare 950 to any other flagship) , ok price but no developer support and a totally confused positioning so advertising can do nothing much in this situation. Apple & Google have better products and models. Just accept it and move on. I have owned all the flagship Windows phones and currently use the 950 but the software just doesn't feel stable. And, no, I am not wedded to MS that I have to have a Windows phone. Advertising is not going to sway me, more apps, more stable platform will.

MS needs to bring back the Android bridge for Windows 10 mobile to be successful. With out this one thing it will have a very difficult time getting any traction due to the app gap. Get the users with the Android bridge, THEN concentrate on the developers getting native apps. After this they need combine Xamarin and UWP to make UAP (Universal App Platform). Many will say that Xamarin is already a free part of VS and what ever. The problem is there is too much difference between Xamarin and UWP especially in the GUI. It needs to be truly write once, and deploy to multiple platforms or at least as much as is feasibly possible. Write platform shims for the different operating systems that can then be targeted by a single .net code base. There is some indication that MS is going this way, but it feels like it is taking forever and we don't know how deep this consolidation will go. This is possible. Additionally they need to bring Java and swift as native languages to .net to compliment C# and VB. This will go a long way to attract developers that don't want to go to the bother of learning a new language. Further more they need to create a compliment to UAP that is aimed at native development that covers C, C++, and objective C. Much of this is already there they just need to develop the platform shims that will translate base commands to platform specific commands. If MS does all this, it would crazy not to develop FIRST on Windows then port to other platforms. To further attract users MS needs to flesh out its eco-system. They need to bring Windows holographic to mobile, they need to get more echo competitors to market, they need to get car-play compatibility and if possible get some car companies to adopt native versions of windows in their in car systems. They need to have a better smart home integration possibly even a built in MS developed app that integrates with 3rd party systems. They need to have a cheaper alternative to the xbox for TV, to compete with the roku, amazon fire, and android tv. They also need to work with television manufactures to offer a version of windows built in to a TV. Next thing is MS services need to become platform agnostic. Things like Edge, Groove, Microsoft Video, and Ebooks need to be on all popular operating systems. They need to be the best in their respective classes. They need to extend each of these platforms to third parties so that they can be enhanced by plug-ins and extension to become platforms in their own right. This will inspire platform loyalty through cross platform availability. MS needs to ensure that they service the rest of the world as well as they do the US. They need to know, where ever you are Microsoft will be there too. Basically ecosystem, ecosystem, ecosystem 3 4 days ago Reply finbaar But there is no hardware to run the ecosystem on.

Microsoft will NOT change their ways now. They've realized they messed up in almost every aspect of marketing the phones, from the model selection, to the carrier selection to the sure you can upgrade - sorry you can't.  They spent, what $13 billion dollars on... something. They are not going down that rabbit hole again.  Sure, a Surface phone could be marginally successful and stem the bloodloss, just like Bing when it started out against Google, but Microsoft is not going to spend billions doing it.  The other reason, it's not a phone.  At least that's what the indications point to.  It willl be a multi-function communication and computer device, ergo, the old way of marketing just won't work.  Microsoft may try some new angles.  Maybe they'll follow in HP's footsteps and just cater to enterprise and the remaining hard core fans. Microsoft may learn from it's mistakes, but, like the Band, or heck, even the Zune, we know, it will always be around to make more of them. There will be a smattering of mobile devices.  Die-hard fans will swear by them.  Microsoft will continue to develop new and wonderful things, but what we know now as Microsoft mobile and your traditional smart phone, that ship has sailed.  In the end, "It just doesn't matter". Micorsoft mobile will never be as popular as Android or Apple.  That's not a bad thing, just an inconvenient truth.  1 4 days ago Reply calbro @mongo46; Microsoft's failure happened because they didn't have the mobile market at heart because of their entrenchment in the enterprise world and make a boat load of $. They had the product line(920,1020,1520 and later 950) and a very good Nokia staff that actually had the market growing but I believe insiders at Microsoft warred against going after the mobile arena which also is very progressive which is not a fit in a slowed conservative habitat inside of Microsoft's managerial heiarchy which Balmer had to fight against something I don't think alot of folks recognized and that is what capsized the mobile strategy. This infighting is what lead to the Vista fiasco of releasing a new OS after the busiest shopping season of the year rather waiting which would have allowed time for drivers development for products  which made no marketing sense. The new CEO let a lot of them go something perhaps Balmer should have done instead of dealing with those stiff conservative minded executives who had to much power which led to disaster and a company having to rebuild a positvie image. 0 4 days ago Reply Great deal +1020 0 4 days ago Reply peterh_oz Every second advert has logos for the Apple & Android app stores, because they're the only apps being built.

Because the marketing in all markets suggested it would work for all languages, which never really came true, and is still a problem.

I don't think there is a golden solution, and a lot is still luck. I think word of mouth is still the best marketing. So the fans and wi dows mobile livers will remain a valuable group. I think what would help the most if microsoft could show fans and lovers for windows mobile and 10 a a well rounded build for once. Granted windows 10 is still an ever evolving OS, but I do believe there is such a thing as a polished and "finished" version within that model.

In fact, it's counter-productive: in this global age potential consumers get to hear of products wherever they are launched, but potential MS customers then always find out that MS aren't making stuff available in their territory so they head off to see if there's any alternatives that are available in their market. 2 4 days ago Reply Moses D You nailed it brother!

They've already let it fall out of the minds of customers. They've delayed it too long. They've allowed the 950 and W10M make even their most devout follwoers doubt Microsoft's commitment. Marketing is going to be meaningless if there's no tangible proof of commitment. For the customer base Microsoft has a shot with, marketing isn't the key. IF it were about marketing, this site would have died long ago, as we would have left for iOS and Android. Enterprise customers will want to see what it can do, more than hear what it might be able to do someday. Marketing was the failure point of WP7 and WP8. Since then, it's been less about marketing and less about production. Why am I likely to (at least temporarily) go Android in 2017? It's not because Microsoft hasn't marketed to me well. It's because they've fallen totally silent, allowed mediocre hardware to be the only option, and shown very little progress on mobile software, thanks to kicking the mobile can down the road both at RS1 last summer and RS2 this spring. 0 4 days ago Reply five-one-three Its honestly much better to widen the gap between Windows Phone and the Surface Phone, they dont want it to be saddled with the failures of Windows Phone as it wont run that OS.

When a consumer sees a product placement after having seen a commercial for the same product, only then does the affirmation for the brand occur and the desire for purchase reinforced.  If Microsoft continues to invest in product placments then they also need to develop high intrigue consumer ads in order to make those product placements effective and cost efficient. 1 4 days ago Reply M_A_Adams I don't think they want to learn from the past!  Nor do I think that Nadella really cares if the mobile product succeeds -- if it fails then, oh well, it was started before him therefore not his fault.

To have one device with decent battery life that is rugged, waterproof and has good sound volume and runs Windows 10 Mobile would be great. I love my Verizon Lumia 735, but would never carry it on heavy equipment with greasy hands. Microsoft has developed/made fantastic phones (as well as plenty of other stuff).

Not that a commercial would make all the difference, but just seems like MS is not very interested in promoting at all anymore 1 4 days ago Reply nikon133 LOL, yeah... 920 was special, wasn't it? :) I had mine in screaming yellow. Actually still have it around, fully functional after, what? 5 years? Such amazing device for its time. But I do love my current 950 XL as well. Yes it does not have wow factor of 920, on a first glance... but... I see a lot of value in additional storage, killer camera, performance increase and screen real estate. I actually just purchased it (after using Lumia 830 for a while, mostly because 920 never got Win 10 upgrade) fully aware it could be my last Windows Phone - if I have to leave platform, at least I'll leave it with one of best Win Phones (short of HP X3). Going with a blast! ;) I don't see myself going back to iPhone (after having iPhone 3Gs back in the days) but I could do something like new Nokia, with stock Android. My work phone, Nexus 5X, behaves well, even if I still prefer WP as a platform, by far. 1 4 days ago Reply david90531 Agreed. Lumia 920 was just like the powerhouse of everything when it was released, I think it might be the most buzz-worthy windows phone ever, and people even considered that's the phone to put on the battle grounds in a sea of iPhones and Samsungs. 950 and 950XL were nothing like that when it came out, even though they were still very powerful and I was still very much excited. I enjoy the removable back (I got 5 back covers to rotate the look), external storage, and the usual great camera. There are also drawbacks though that sometimes do give me headaches, such as the subpar speakers, grainy front camera (I'm not sure if this is just me but selfies don't look great at all under darker lighting), and of course the random reboots here and there (obviously I've signed myself for that when I step onboard with Windows 10 mobile, INSIDERS FAST but still..). I too thought about this being my last Windows Phone, but I think I'm willing to give Surface Phone a shot, if it ever become reality, otherwise I will probably go for something like a Oneplus 3T or whatever Pixel there will be.  0 4 days ago Reply nikon133 My only real issue with 950 XL is Bluetooth. Phone randomly connects and disconnects, sometimes doesn't connect at all (until Bluetooth option in phone's setup is turned off and back on, or whole phone is restarted). I have two BT devices, Jabra Tour and Jabra Classic... both behave the same. However, both work fine with 920, 830 and Nexus 5X, so I cannot blame them either. I was starting to worry that my phone might have faulty BT, but then it seems to work fine with FitBit Charge 2 and - ironically - with my old BT headset for Playstation 3. Luckily, I don't require BT much on my personal phone... still, it is disappointing that one of basic phone features nowadays somehow has managed to devolve, and on flagship phones. Heard somewhere that incoming Creators Update should bring some fixes to BT, but mostly being whispered in forums, nothing official from Microsoft... hopeful but not holding my breath. 0 3 days ago Reply Charles Fecht They did kinda nail the Surface Studio commercial 4 4 days ago Reply david90531 That's the point.

Microsoft: OK   Verizon: Take Visual Voicemail out of the OS Microsoft: That’s a standard feature and iOS has it Verizon: We’ll charge your customers for it Microsoft: OK   Verizon: That standard phone (930), We’ll take it this time but change the name and then never update the OS. Microsoft: OK 0 3 days ago Reply pirate78 If they want their platform to be taken seriously they need to stop the nonsense such as "we go where the people are...", this just pisses off the fans. If your going to go where the people are then why are you starting a brand new mobile OS? People are not going to be there for sure. You need to support this platform with your own dedicated (and preferably exclusive) offerings until you get more people. But they went through with their strategy anyway. They released software for Apple that didn't make it to the phone until way later, they released useful apps like the authenticator for Android first and in the meantime gave their fans essentially a place holder of an app until way later. Then they started changing the UI of the phone to be more friendly to those who use Apple or Android systems, cutting off features that made the OS fresh and unique. Trying desperately to please everyone from other platforms while stripping away everything that made Windows on phone interesting, more functional and different from the rest. Thus ******* of the fans further. So what did the fans do? They went "where the people are". And that wasn't on Windows Mobile. Now they have to work real hard to get new users and get past all of the negative rhetoric from those who, at one point, were their loyal fans. 3 4 days ago Reply max-ecs My own opinion?...

Long term, they need to compete with Google and Apple, because whatever comes next for mobile devices, both Google and Apple will have much better starting point. If they are satisfied only to be one of software vendors - even very strong one - than it is their decision. 0 4 days ago Reply Tom Westrick I don't think there is a "next" for mobile. It is what it is at this point. Look at a desktop today compared to a desktop from the 1980's. There are new ports and a definite jump in capabilities, but the form factor is the same. Same with laptops; they aren't fundamentally different from the earliest laptops. The same thing will happen with smartphones: there will be new sensors and accessories that will make the phones of tomorrow better than the phones of today, but the form factor is set. It's still going to be a 5 to 6 inch device with glass on the front, camera on the back, speakers, etc.  Some thought watches or Hololens type devices would take this space over, but I don't that's going to happen for a variety of reasons. I can't read a comic book, watch Netlfix or flip through Facebook photos on a watch. I could on a Hololens and it'd be neat, but then I have this thing on my head all day long.  0 4 days ago Reply nikon133 Well... depends on how you look at tech. I think that laptops were next to desktops, once tech improved to a level where it can be portable. Tablets and convertibles were next to laptops. That said, having new format does not necessarily kill old one - it branches out, sort of. As you have said, at some point existing tech matures to a level where improvements are incremental within same form factor, but new form factors are made possible by tech improvements. I think there is next for mobile. There are wearables. Augmented reality. Phones actually capable to replace computers in meaningful way, easy to carry around, used as computer in office, plugged to full size peripherals through docking station. Convertible phones? Microsoft and partners have given us a glimpse where mobiles can go - Continuum dock for 950/950 XL, desktop dock and laptop "shell" for HP Elite X3 (with cloud-virtualised desktop apps)... ... but, in order to go further in these new directions, Windows Mobile has to be strong. Branches need to be healthy in order to grow, metaphorically speaking. Otherwise they wither and fall off. Kind of like what is happening to current Windows Mobile branch, sadly. In their infancy, new formats need that initial value before new ideas they are built on take off and mature; compatibility with previous format, strong ecosystem (even if legacy one)... a beachead. Who would buy, say, Playstation VR, if Sony has released it with new console, with no marketshare and very few games available? But as it was released into existing PS4 world, with big user base and many games available (legacy games with no VR support) it has much easier job to grow. It has identity. Visibility. A chance, I think. 1 4 days ago Reply John Bagg Great article Jason.  It seems that the 1020 was the last major marketing push.  Windows phone was the only smart phone I ever owned until last year, all the way back to the BlackJack.  Sold the 950 on Ebay, and bought a used Galaxy.  I became so frustrated with Microsoft's apparent lack of care for my loyalty, that when Belfiore used the iPhone to tweet, and my continual begging of my bank to develop a Windows app was finally answered with a resounding "No", I gave up.  Ironically, it was about a month before Mary Jo Foley gave up on her phone.  Why did I leave?

But really, 15% in Italy doesn't get them anywhere, especially since none of the high end devices sold at all and sales dropped soon after as the Moto G and other Android phones caught up on the low end.

I didn't see it, but that would explain why it was so popular. Any other tv ads for other models? No...and it's reflected in how well It's sold and known in the general population. As for targeting enterprise...do you know how long it takes enterprise to adopt to new hardware? The company I'm working for is still using some hardware from last decade, and has only recently seen new technologies starting to be used, like servers running ssd hard drives, and even Windows 10 on a few test PCs...people passing by the PC ask, is that an IMac? Otherwise its still Windows 7 in the office, and cash registers using Windows XP POS edition in the stores (which I assume and hope is still supported by MS), again last decade stuff. We are using more of Microsoft's cloud technologies as our old servers running Outlook and Office break down (I guess it's cheaper than buying and maintaining the hardware and software updates). But phones are hardware, and half of the phones used are Samsung S4, the other half is the S7. So if Microsoft is hoping our company to adopt Windows phones, it won't happen until at least 2020 when we have to replace half of the S7s that we have. On the other hand Consumers will adopt new technology either now or next year when the price drops to 50% of what it is this year. If they have to wait longer, it's already forgotten in favor of the next cycle of technology. Unfortunately, Microsoft has chosen to "retrench" their phones just outside that window of consumer consciousness and so its been forgotten by all but the fans...which will probably only hold for another year, tops, before the rate of dropout for fans reaches almost 100% 2 4 days ago Reply bub78 Yes, the 1020 ad focused on the 41mp camera.

Even if that device existed, the amount of marketing and reassurance they would have to provide to the public isn't overcomable in my opinion.  The only way for them to gain consumer confidence is to display some themselves.  They should start releasing phones, 1st party apps, 1st party games, and keep even current users interested.  I understand they want to put everything on hold (at least on the hardware side) but that was their worst mistake.  Keeping at least some new devices in the low range and mid range category would have brought SOME attention to the platform now that people are starting to be a little more open to the Windows 10 OS. 8 4 days ago Reply DrunkasaurusRex I agree 100%. A foldable phone that runs Windows x86 apps on ARM would be really cool but it would be so out of the ordinary that we definitely would have heard about it by now. I think Satya's plan is to go after enterprise since that's where Windows is the strongest and they really can't afford to lose that foothold. They're positioning HoloLens in that space too, and I'm sure if it's successful there we'll see a commercial release the same way we saw computers slowly creep into every home, we'll see HoloLens do the same thing. My best guess is that MS continues to develop the mobile platform simply because they really want Windows to run on ARM but I would be very surprised if we ever saw another phone from MS again. 0 3 days ago Reply Redsun9 Great article Jason Ward.

What did Microsoft do wrong here and what did Google do right to remove much of the marketing burden from themselves? 0 4 days ago Reply bub78 Surface phone articles are clickbait for Windows phone fans. -14 4 days ago Reply x I'm tc Especially since there probably will never be a Surface phone. -8 4 days ago Reply Jason Ward Actually, clickbait articles by nature have no substance. The desire of the author is to simply generate clicks - not to be read. If you've read this piece, you would see more well referenced substance to how MS executed its marketing strategy, likely more than you'll get from most other sites. Also, it is clear (if you don't want to accept my testimony) by the evident passion, effort and detail (and the time committed to it) that is in my writing, that I want my work read, not just clicked on. I'm a writer. I have a passion for writing. Before I'm a tech writer I'm a writer: poetry, plays, short stories, even started on a couple of books. Writing clickbait articles offers nothing to satisfy my innate passions as a writer. 30 4 days ago Reply bub78 I appreciate your response, but satisfying your passions as a writer does not necessarily satisfy my needs as a reader. While I understand there is a dearth of Windows mobile/phone news to write about, there seems to be an endless stream of articles discussing a device that's only rumored to exist and may not be released for another couple of years. An article like the one youve written might be appropriate if there actually were a device to be released sometime soon, as it stands its just a long piece of history and conjecture about marketing of all things. It becomes wearying to see "Surface Phone" in the headlines of articles, when there is no actual news or story to break on the mythical device. For me, that phrase in a headline has become clickbait. -3 4 days ago Reply Jason Ward Hi bub78: Thanks for the discussion. Given that Microsoft's marketing of its mobile devices is something that consistently comes under fire in this community this article which gives a picture of how Microsoft markets and has marketed (which isn't covered much anywhere else to this extent and depth) while also incorporating the company's future mobile efforts that interest the community is relevant. My passion as a writer, particularly within this setting, are often a drive to inform and provide context to the readers. All readers here have varying degrees of knowledge about the things we talk about here (as do we writers of course). Thus many of the readers of this piece may not have been aware of Capossela's marketing strategy to incorporate marketing into products in luei of a television campaign. Informing the thousands of readers who may not have know that may have helped them see Microsoft's marketing strategy in a different light. Furthermore, it may have helped them to set expectations about how a potential Surface may be marketed if Microsoft continues with this strategy. Or it may have equipped readers who didn't know with more information so that they can contribute to the ongoing dialogue of MS mobile efforts in a more informed manner. I like to help elevate the conversation, give people a little more to think about than the rhetoric in an echo chamber. 🙂 3 4 days ago Reply bleached At what point is marketing not the answer and you just need a better product? Where is the article about how Microsoft repeatedly made an inferior product and it repeatedly failed in the market? Where is the honest article about all the shortcomings with Windows phones that caused them to fail? All I hear is excuse after excuse. It is the developers faults, it is marketing, it is the carriers, it is the manufacturers, etc. Is Microsoft's product ever in the wrong here? At what point do you actually hold Microsoft accountable for their inferior platform and demand something new? Windows phone is dead and anything even remotely resembling Windows phone will fail even harder tomorrow. It won't matter what Microsoft calls it or how they market it. That was never the issue. The product is the issue. 0 4 days ago Reply techiez 950 was half hearted product because it was handed over to panos from Nokia team, but nobody mentions of how bad the W10M was on those phones initially. -2 3 days ago Reply Tejasvi Bhat Love the article and agree with the points. While I dont agree your specific article can be called clickbait, it is true that most other websites do it with regards to surface phone rumours. Just recycled rumors over and over again with nothing concrete. And it just causes heartache for people like me who are holding on to windows with an old device (wanting to change) waiting for some confirmation about the surface phone so I dont go ahead and make a temporary shift to android. So more and more articles coming up about surface phone without an official confirmation of the device even being real just causes frustration. 0 2 days ago Reply Aden Rossinni Well, it's the kind of news that MS and WM fans want. So..... 0 4 days ago Reply ScubaDog For a huge part of the Windows Phone run Microsoft was charging a pretty penny for OEMs to license the OS on their hardware and also required they have capacitive buttons.  Android, not so much.  So, from a business aspect, Android was more attractive. For users who like to spend their lives customizing the phone instead of actually getting anything done with it, Android was also more attractive.  I used to be in that crowd in the old PocketPC days.  Then I grew out of that childishness and decided I wanted a device that was more productive.  Also, I really, really hate not having those capacity buttons.  Constantly having to swipe my screen to get my controls back is just plain stupid, period.  So, Microsoft was not nearly as attractive an OS compared to Android, except to people like me. 0 4 days ago Reply bleached It wasn't users customizing their phones that was important. Manufacturers having control over their phones is the important part. Windows phone was not more productive either. It was less productive, just the app gap made it that way. The locked down UI also didn't help in that regards. -4 4 days ago Reply nikon133 I think major thing is - Google had platform comparable to iPhone before Microsoft did. Once OEMs have chosen it, it is strategic decision that will not be changed overnight. Just as OEMs haven't ditched MSDOS for other emerging OSs, not because MSDOS was better - it wasn't, in most cases - but because ecosystem was already building around it, beachead into corporate segments was established - so would OEMs not switch from Android to Windows Phone, it was simply more risky. Re users: it is word of mouth, really. Not always but in many cases. With modern smartphones emerging, consumers did not know much, and recommendation from friend/relative was worth a lot. Confidence building. Being able to play with someone's phone which is real in-use phone, not just turned on (or not) item sitting on store shelve. 0 4 days ago Reply Whodaboss @nikon133 "... word of mouth...". 100% on the mark.  But not necessarily from friends/relatives, but from the carrier sales clerk.  They are the front line.  I remember going to the Tmobile and Verizon stores and ask about a Windows Phone and they would quickly try to upsell me to an Android or iPhone.  This was and still is the place where Microsoft should invest ALL thier efforts.  Because when someone walks into a store and is not quite sure what they want they ask for a recommendation.  And if the sales clerk don't recommend a WP device there will be no change.  0 3 days ago Reply max-ecs Yes, right, why all OEMS didn't marketed wp phones?... Don't make me think about they got money from someone to boycott ms.. 0 4 days ago Reply bleached You don't think Samsung is more motivated to market THEIR OWN Touchwiz phones instead of MICROSOFT'S Windows phone? -5 4 days ago Reply nikon133 Most OEMs were not fully into it. Since number of them are already Microsoft partners, one way or another - making desktops and laptops, monitors, PC components - I would expectt hat many were under some sort of contractual obligation to release Windows Phone. And they did. But hardly anyone really stood behind those products. They were more, like, checkboxes. Done, and move back to selling Android to customers. And then, little and big sabotages served by Google didn't help. No YouTube app, anyone but Google forced to write them in inferior HTML5; why original MS YouTube app was blocked. No Google Maps, 3rd party clearly inferior.  Eventually, biggest mistakes were made by Microsoft themselves. In situation where PC market is saturated and Microsoft cannot grow much further - they are, what, 10% short of having it completely, give or take? - they should have really focused on mobile market. Give OS for free. Give OEMs more flexibility. Aggressively pay devs to port popular apps to Windows Phone. And market it like there's no tomorrow. Other thing MS hasn't done successfully was tying WP to whole MS ecosystem. With almost everyone having Windows PC, they should have found a way to make Windows Phone must-have for Windows computer users. Offer better WinTunes and Store (iTunes are crappy on PC, but still big part of iPhone success). Buy YouTube before Google did, and invest heavily in other media. Make WP a champion of enterprise world, with unseen integration with Exchange SharePoint and other MS products and services. And market it like there's no tomorrow. 3 4 days ago Reply Tom Westrick Because Google/Android allow OEM's to modify their OS to add new features and fit their own design language, while Windows doesn't. With Android, Samsung can include and market features that make their device stand out, whereas with Windows it'd look and act the same as any other Windows device.  0 4 days ago Reply abduz When Samsung was on board ..the WP ecosystem was lacking so much and if they did ads for both Android and Windows Phone..Windows phone didnt have much to show. Due to restrictions from MS, OEMs such as Samsung couldnt add any features to boast about in an advert or differentiate themselves. Whereas on android, they they needed to show what their devices' could do that devices from other OEMs couldnt ...there was features and UI to compete for. ...and had they advertised both device's it was only going to make WP look worse. As much as I loved it back then, Android was feature and app rich. 0 4 days ago Reply techiez and the few unique features that Lumia was able to get was due Nokia literally hacking the OS to put features onto it. 0 3 days ago Reply kenzibit Panos Panay's intro to the Lumia 950/XL was spectacular imo.

The Lumia 950 introduction was nothing more than an afterthought and certainly not spectacular. Part of that is that the phon ewas so far removed from where he was (going) with Surface and he was probably just told to include it. The big problem is that for Mobile to succeed you need to be able to reach out to and understand consumers, neither of which Microsoft is capable of. The Surface phone will _not_ be your average joe smart phone, it will be a fairly pricey and powerful device geared comepletely towards enterprise. If any consumers want to hop on fine, but it's not the focus, never was and never will be. 3 4 days ago Reply 19Michael87 He did present it with passion though, he sold me on the device!

Just as many/most best racing drivers have killer instinct and huge ego - it is not coincident, it is part of formula that makes them best drivers. 3 4 days ago Reply Awhispersecho I don't think it showed him to be self centered at all. I think he did a god job of presenting them considering he knew they were dead products. He knew MS made them just to get something out there and they were not going to put any marketing behind them. He also knew that only 1 of them was going to be carried by a carrier and even then, only 1 carrier. Kinda hard to get excited about presenting a product knowing all of those things. 3 4 days ago Reply Podster16 Days?

The introduction of the 950/XL convinced me even then that Microsoft had squandered any talent it got from Nokia and was vomiting on their own product.  W10M has been almost a complete disappointment to me and my wife, after having been HUGE cheerleaders of both WP7 and WP8.  Somehow, both my wife and I allowed ourselves to be convinced to throw away a total of $1200 on a pair of Lumia 950 devices. And we have regretted it daily. Despite having what was then the latest hardware, the camera was a huge disappointment compared to my 1020, and the performance of W10 on the device is quite a bit slower than WP8.1 on my 1020 (with exception of the camera app itself).  Even on the latest build, 15063, I can run things side by side and the 1020 just leaves the 950 in the dust.  So, I have really very little confidence MS knows what it's doing here.  I have a Surface Pro 3 and my wife has the SP4, and we love these devices.  But I just don't believe that MS will come out with a smartphone (or WHATEVER they are going to call it) that's as impressive.  I want a device with a camera that is so much better than the competition that there's no debate. If I'm going to have to put up with how horrible the user experience is in W10M, the device better be a LOT snappier.  And if the design and solidness of the hardware is going to be like the 950 or like every other Android device, then there's just no point. 11 4 days ago Reply 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2016 Mobile Nations • Terms and Conditions • Privacy Policy • Careers: Writer | Dev • Licensing • External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

(REUTERS/Jacques Brinon/Pool/File Photo) “Google” has become synonymous with “search for information,” but even mighty Google has its drawbacks — especially if you value your privacy. The world’s most famous search site is also known for saving your search history, reading your Gmail and tracking what you click online. Tip in a Tip: Did you know that Google also tracks your physical location and when you were there? Click here to see a map showing your detailed location history. Before you break out the torches and pitchforks, remember that Google is trying to make its services as useful as possible. The company’s goal is to find out what you want before you want it. But maybe you want a break from the well-intended surveillance. What are your alternatives? Which search engines don’t step on your virtual heels? Here are three ways to search the internet that you may find refreshing. DuckDuckGo This search engine is unusual in many ways. First, it wasn’t developed in California, but in Pennsylvania. Second, DuckDuckGo’s mission is to keep users’ information private and to prevent personalized search results. So what’s wrong with personalized search results? Don’t you want your phone or computer to cater to your interests? The creators of DuckDuckGo say this kind of technology creates a “filter bubble.” Google specializes in sending you only the content it thinks you want, not everything available. More from Kim Komando Why you should ALWAYS delete your web cookies (and how to do it) 5 Google Flights secrets you never knew Find the exact location of any phone There’s more to DuckDuckGo than just not being Google. The search engine includes nifty calculators and other tricks you’ve come to expect, and you can customize its interface with search shortcuts and an Instant Answers feature. You might be surprised by the quality of Instant Answers, which easily rivals Google’s Knowledge Graph. You can also make DuckDuckGo an extension of your browser and activate more privacy settings to keep your search history as protected as possible. Click here to check out DuckDuckGo. Ixquick Ixquick calls itself the world’s most private search site. That may sound a little grand, but it’s earned its stripes. Ixquick doesn’t record your IP address, browser information or search history. The real magic of Ixquick is its “search by proxy” feature, which prevents websites from knowing what IP address you’re using. As you browse their pages, you’re basically invisible. This feature can slow down your searches, but that’s a small price to pay if privacy is your top priority. Here’s an example: Suppose you use Ixquick to search for “Komando.” Your result — a list of websites it has found that match your search — will resemble Google’s. But each result has three options: • Click the regular link, and you’ll visit the page as you normally would, meaning the website can see you. • Choose “Highlight” to see the site’s most basic information. This way, you don’t visit the site. You just see what it’s about. • Pick “Proxy” and you will remain anonymous. The site will see Ixquick’s IP address, not yours. Click here to use Ixquick. Tor If you’re looking for something a little more sophisticated, you might consider Tor, which is very popular in computer-savvy circles. The Tor Project describes itself as an “anonymity network,” which means privacy is its primary goal. The company’s logo is an onion, and it’s more than just a cute cartoon. Tor, an acronym for “The Onion Router,” uses sophisticated encryption software that behaves like the layers of an onion, making it virtually impossible for someone to track your movements online. Tor bounces your communications through a global network, a real headache for anyone trying to find your physical location. You may have heard of Tor because this same technology is used to access the Dark Web. (Click here to learn more about the Dark Web.) That may sound creepy, and it’s true that Tor has been used for illegal activity online, but the software itself is perfectly legal and shouldn’t pose any problems. Remember: It’s not the tool that causes problems. It’s how you use it. But before you rush to the Tor website and download the free software, keep in mind that Tor may slow down your searches, and it may also change your web browser’s settings. Click here to install and use the Tor Browser. How else can you maintain your privacy in this era of rampant data breaches?

The company even added in a few cheeky extras to its YouTube clip of the 'race' claiming that US president Donald Trump has revealed he doesn't wear fake tan, that the Royal Family will be appearing in an episode of Gogglebox and that a newly discovered Article 52 will reverse Brexit . George Osborne The former chancellor is planning to launch his own clothing line, according to The Guardian . In a letter to the House of Commons authorities it was revealed the new Evening Standard editor has told the advisory committee on business appointments that his new fashion firm would design “high-quality, hi-visibility industrial garments aimed at the multitasking CEO.” The news reignited a row over his multiple business commitments clashing with his role as an MP. It was (actually) announced in March that Osborne was taking over the helm of the Evening Standard, which led many to claim it would clash with his role as MP for Tatton. The firm has been registered at Companies House with the name “Georgio”. Southern Rail to be run by a dog called Brian Southern Rail is to be run by a dog called Brian after the rail operator called the bluff of a woman who claimed her pet could do a better job, reports Surrey Mirror. Southern's parent company Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) took issue with a Tweet sent on Thursday by frustrated commuter Sandy Undercarriage who flippantly suggested her blonde wire haired dachshund Brian was more up to the task of running the region's train services. GTR had evidently had enough of the constant criticism over the reliability of Southern trains and replied testily with: "Fine, prove it. Brian starts tomorrow. He'd better not be late."

Lady Godiva gets COVERED UP Scandalous (Photo: Coventry Telegraph) Lady Godiva could be forced to put some clothes on after complaints about her bare bosoms. Leaked planning documents show how Lady Godiva’s naked body could finally be covered after nearly 1,000 years, reports Coventry Telegraph. Prudish visitors to the city, including a Norwegian man called Olaf Prilo, were appalled by the “gaudy” Lady Godiva clock, commissioned in the 1950s, which shows the Countess of Mercia emerging from the wall every hour. Some over-sensitive tourists are also concerned about the naked Godiva statue in Broadgate. Mr Prilo told the Telegraph: "I was walking through the city centre with my family while we were visiting our daughter at university. "I've got a seven-year-old son and he wouldn't laughing when he saw the naked statues of Lady Godiva. "I felt foolish having to explain in front of crowds why there was a naked woman riding a horse." Tough Mudder The Puppy Mudder team (Photo: Edelman for Puppy Mudder) After the overwhelming success of bringing an obstacle course event to humans, Tough Mudder has decided to branch out into the animal population. Puppy Mudder will launch in the UK with a slew of events designed to test your dog’s stamina, strength and mental grit. Obstacles include fresh takes on classic obstacles like Barktic Enema and Electroshock Therapuppy. Prosecco on tap at Wales' Bodelwyddan Castle Prosecco on tap at Bodelwyddan Castle (Photo: Daily Post) Guests at one of North Wales’ most popular hotels are in for a treat after a request from a customer was taken literally. Bodelwyddan Castle’s most exclusive rooms have been upgraded from the standard mini-bar experience, reports Wales Online. The move comes after a customer feedback survey got a response from one couple who stayed at the Warner Leisure Hotels site saying all that was missing from their experience was ‘Prosecco on tap’. So the adults-only holidays firm has taken the demand literally, and its en suite rooms are now equipped - for a limited time only - with taps in the bathroom from which the fizzy alcoholic tipple will flow 24-hours a day.

Top-secret 'invisible' boat tested on Newcastle's River Tees The invisible ship (Photo: Gazette Live) Military chiefs have carried out top-secret tests on an invisible boat along the River Tees. Jaw-dropping footage shows the stealth vessel being sailed down steel river on Friday morning. Sources told Gazette Live it was the first time the multi-billion pound ship had been tested. “This ship will change the world,” they added. “Nobody has ever seen anything like it. “People won’t believe what they aren’t seeing.” Boffins have spent three decades working on the invisible ship at a mysterious underground lab in Brotton. Pub launches world's first 'scratch and lick’ menu Stoke-on-Trent pub launches world's first 'scratch and lick' menu (Photo: The Sentinel) A Stoke-on-Trent boozer has devised an ingenious answer to help customers make up their minds about what they want to order off the menu. The Sneyd Arms has launched the world's very first 'scratch and lick’ menu, reports the Stoke Sentinel. Flavour experts at the pub have joined forces with food scientists and engineers to develop the new LickTech technology, which allows guests to taste their food before they order. New items on the 'scratch and lick' menu include: Flaming Grill's barbeque marinated Double Dipped Rib Eye Steak, its five flavour Frickin' Chicken Skewers and its newest challenge dish, the Mother Clucker Sandwich Prince Harry to be renamed as the Duke of Croydon Prince Harry (Photo: Reuters) Prince Harry will take on the new title when he gets married, it has been revealed. It is understood that His Royal Highness chose the title himself due to the “epic” time he had in the borough during the late 2000s. The press was banned from reporting it at the time but Harry and brother William spent most Saturday nights in the town's pubs and clubs for a number of years. A Royal spokesman told the Croydon Advertiser that Harry and his brother William "would often stay in a local Travelodge (after a particularly heavy night out) and then go for a Toby Carvery on the Sunday before heading back to Buckingham Palace for that week's royal engagements.” Weirdly, the news broke on the same day the Daily Mail announced Prince Harry had already secretly married the Suits star in Las Vegas. Gorilla begins juggling jacket potatoes Juggling gorilla (Photo: Paignton Zoo) A gorilla at Devon’s Paignton Zoo has been spotted juggling with jacket potatoes. The Western lowland gorilla is often thrown a few hot spuds to keep them warm on cold days, but over the winter, keepers noticed 13-year-old Kiondo start to throw his up into the air and catch them again. Curator of Mammals Neil Bemment said: “Jacket potatoes are one of Kiondo’s favourites. "It may have begun when he was thrown a few potatoes at the same time that were a little too hot, or he may just have been mimicking the keepers. "But it would appear that he is now a contender for Britain’s Got Talent." Welsh town to get its own Hollywood sign The sign is to celebrate the links the town and surrounding area have with major films like The Dark Knight Rises and Jurassic World 2 A small Welsh town is to get a huge Hollywood-style sign that could become a national landmark. The sign is to celebrate the links the town and surrounding area have with major films like The Dark Knight Rises and Jurassic World 2, which is being shot in the nearby Brecon Beacons. The project is funded by EU money and could turn out to be the last EU-funded project in Wales. Prime Minister Theresa May triggered Article 50 this week, formally triggering the UK's withdrawal from the union. The white capital letters are each around six metres tall, around half the height of the letters of the original Hollywood sign, reports Wales Online.

Every year, the tech giant puts out a bunch of prank videos and Easter eggs. It may not be the most original trick — Google did the same thing on the desktop version of Maps in 2015 — but it’s a whole lot of fun. Because Google put it in the mobile app, you can play “Ms. Pac-Man” on your phone just as you would any other game. “Starting now until April 4, you can chomp fruit, avoid ghosts, and collect PAC-Dots along city streets in Google Maps worldwide—all as Ms,” PAC-MAPS product manager David Hendon said in blog post. And it’s easy to find: Open the app on your phone, and a button to start the game will be front and center. The best part is that you get to play on real streets. My game took place in the Flatiron District in New York City. You can move Ms. Pac-Man around by swiping in any direction, and your score is at the top of the screen.

It is designed to help with any outdoor activities. But beware. It’s another one of Google’s April Fools’ Day pranks. "The smart yard is finally here,” the company said in a statement. "Google Gnome is here to give every home in America the seamless, voice-activated Connected Yard Experience we all so desperately need." Read: Google Updates Calendar App With Optimization For iPad Google Gnome is designed "to work hard and play hard," the company stated, referencing numerous ways it can help one with outdoor tasks. "Go hands-free with your pressure washer, leaf blower, tiller, and more. Its cutting edge riding lawnmower integration features a proprietary autopilot mode, allowing you to kick back and ride shotgun on days when you just can’t even," the company wrote. The product is quite simple actually. You just go outside and speak your command to the device, which favors a lantern, with a blue bottom and pointed red hat. The device can be found in the Google Store or the Made by Google website. There is even a commercial for Google Gnome. Twitter users decided to weigh in on the outdoor device with an assortment of comments. "This Google Gnome thing looks like it can annoy the hell out of somebody," one Twitter user wrote. "THIS IS HILARIOUS I WANT 10 OF THEM," wrote another. In contrast, "Google Home," helps with indoors tasks like dimming the lights in the kitchen or even setting up the thermostat. The product costs $129.  Google Maps added a Ms. Pac-Maps game early Friday on the lower left corner. To play, just click on the pink Ms. Pac-Man icon. The game allowed users to play on any local roads, while keeping tabs on the score.

For a conference that - as the name suggests - focuses on marketing, a distinct theme emerged in year five of the industry’s largest annual get-together: Customer Experience. Social Media Examiner CEO Michael Stelzner called social media the "fastest-changing industry on the planet" in his opening keynote, “Social Media Marketing in 2017: What the Newest Research Reveals”. He spoke at length about the sophisticated algorithms at Facebook and Google that “are a nightmare for marketers”. Why are algorithms a nightmare? Because “Google and Facebook want people to see quality content,” Stelzner said. “Algorithms are designed to help consumers, not marketers.” Translation: Google and Facebook are focused on the customer experience, even if it means frustrating the advertisers that keep them in business. The answer, Stelzner revealed, is that “companies should refocus on their community by being helpful”. This is a fundamental change for advertisers and marketers, who are used to being able to shout their message with a bullhorn. In social media, people get to talk back, so marketers have to do more than sell. They have to create content that's useful, engaging, and generally additive to customers’ lives. Scott Monty, a social media and marketing consultant, blogger, and podcaster, emphatically reiterated this point in his presentation entitled, “Why We’ve Failed: The Customer Is No Longer Our Focus”. “Social media was supposed to get us more customer-focused, personalized and conversational,” he said, “but we've lost our way”. He noted that “trust matters” because consumers today trust someone they know more than anyone else and "all it takes us one misstep and trust disappears”. Citing the Roman philosopher Cicero, Monty said that marketing should “think my thoughts, feel my feelings, speak my words” and that brands must be authentic, responsive, and compelling in their communications to consumers. But beyond that, companies need to start with a great product. "You're not going to get anywhere if you have a crappy product or service," he said, adding that “social media amplifies what's wrong with your business”. His answer? Make your customer feel like a “king or queen” for a day to show them how much you care about them. Now that sounds like a great customer experience. Joey Coleman, a recognized expert in customer experience design, would agree. Coleman, who delivered a stellar keynote on the big stage in front of more than 3,000 people, talked about “Turning Customers into Life-Long Advocates in the First 100 Days”. "We subject our customers to a roller coaster of emotions every time they do business with us," he began, citing some downright scary statistics - including the fact that between 20% and 70% of customers leave a given business within the first 100 days. But if they stay until day 101, he added, customers will remain loyal to the company for an average of 5 more years. "If you don't prioritize your client, someone else will,” Coleman warned, adding that if companies create remarkable experiences in real life, it will translate into social media when customers share with friends and followers. Customer experience thought leader Blake Morgan concurred in her presentation, suggesting that “everyone from the CEO down needs to understand their customers' lives and how they experience the brand”. “Your digital strategy must consider the life your customer is living. How will you leverage digital to make your customers' lives better?” she asked. Even presentations with titles that had nothing to do with customer experience focused heavily on listening to customers and catering to their wants and needs. In her talk entitled, “How to Create Breakthrough Written Marketing Content,” MarketingProfs Chief Content Officer Ann Handley reminded marketers that “the reader isn’t thinking what you’re thinking” and asked the audience to take a pledge that they “will have pathological empathy for the reader". Not coincidentally, empathy is perhaps the #1 characteristic of a superstar customer service agent. Handley also cited Simple Bank as a great example of a seamless customer experience, noting that they even take legally required language and make it fun and understandable for the customer. Similarly, in his presentation entitled, “Growth Hacking: How to Use Social Media to Rapidly Grow Your New Business or Product,” social media consultant and author Neal Schaffer told his audience: "If you really want to be successful at social media marketing, you need to pivot with communities." In other words, listen to what the audience wants and deliver that. "Social media is a huge focus group that's free," he added. Schaffer shared an example of car maker Acura taking a picture of customers in their new car while it’s still in the showroom and sending it to them so they’ll share it on their social media channels. This isn’t just a marketing ploy; it’s also a way for Acura to extend the customer experience beyond the showroom, exposing it to a broader audience. And when Marcus Sheridan, the content marketing genius and self-proclaimed “Sales Lion”, took the stage for his session on “7 Powerful Strategies for Building a World-Class Content Marketing Plan,” he focused on – you guessed it – the customer. "It doesn't matter what we want to tell them, it matters what they want to know," he said, adding that “the most powerful content marketing tool in the world is your ears”. The fact is that both social media and marketing are important parts of the overall customer experience, which, by definition, includes every single interaction a customer has with a brand. What's become clear to many of the distinguished speakers at this year’s Social Media Marketing World is that by focusing on the customer, we can not only improve our marketing and increase sales, we can keep our customers happier, longer.

Toshiba has reportedly completed the first round of bidding for its prized memory chip business, seen as key for the cash-strapped company to turn itself around. Some 10 foreign companies and funds, including Google and Amazon, tendered bids, the mass-circulation Yomiuri Shimbun said, quoting unnamed sources. The two US tech giants are expected to use Toshiba’s memory chips for their cloud services, the daily said. Google launches Allo, its smart messenger service Taiwan’s Hon Hai, which acquired Japanese electronics maker Sharp last year, has apparently bid more than 2 trillion yen ($18 billion), the daily said. Immediate confirmation of the report was not available. Toshiba shares jumped more than five percent on Friday after local media reported that bidders included Apple, US private-equity firm Silver Lake Partners and American chipmaker Broadcom. Toshiba is expected to negotiate with individual candidates this month. Toshiba mulls chips business stake sale to Western Digital – source Local media said any foreign buyer would need to pass a Japanese government review, given concerns about security around systems already using Toshiba’s memory chips. Toshiba is the world’s number two supplier of memory chips for smartphones and computers, behind South Korea’s Samsung, and the business accounted for about a quarter of its 5.67 trillion yen in revenue last fiscal year. The news report came after angry investors lambasted Toshiba executives at a shareholders meeting over its warning that annual losses could balloon to more than $9.0 billion. The red ink is largely tied to huge cost overruns and construction delays at its US nuclear power unit Westinghouse Electric, which filed for bankruptcy protection late March.

GROW Top 5 Business Tools to Boost Your Productivity in 2017 Running a business is a 24/7 job, here are 5 areas where you can get back more of that time. By Drew Hendricks Drew Hendricks is a tech, social media, and environmental addict. He's written for many major publications, such as Forbes and Entrepreneur. @DrewAHendricks Contributor, Inc.com@DrewAHendricks WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Is it just me, or does running a business seem more demanding than ever? Between staying on top of all the to-dos, adopting the latest technology, following digital marketing trends and managing your data, you can be left to wonder how you'll possibly manage it all in a 24-hour day. Given these demands, and the increase in remote workforces, it's no wonder that in the latest Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, 45% of entrepreneurs are stressed out. But the business world isn't just stressed out; it's also getting less done. The Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that productivity has only risen 1% YOY from 2015 to 2016, much less than the typical increase experienced earlier in the decade. So what's a busy entrepreneur to do? Streamline. By tapping into cloud-based technology that organizes and prioritizes your tasks, you can accomplish more in a given day, even while on the go. If you want to boost your productivity and drive your business to the top, try these 5 essential tools for productivity-oriented businesses. To-do lists In an increasingly hectic business landscape, we'd be lost without a list that kept us on track. Apps like Google Tasks keep you in the loop on what you need to do, all the while seamlessly integrating with your Google account. With this app, the focus is on streamlining and simplifying tasking processes. You can easily highlight text across the web and add it as a new task with a click, or add emails as to do's. Plus, you can see your list in Gmail, Calendar, iCal and through Google Tasks, which is just good business sense in our increasingly crowded tech spheres. Project management tools The most effective project management systems provide cross-communication abilities that businesses need in an increasingly remote-work landscape. Having the right apps in place can make tracking invoices, timelines and reports a breeze--and make your job a lot simpler. Cloud-based project management systems like WorkflowMax provide end-to-end project management from quoting through to invoicing. You can even track time and costs as you go so you can stay on top of your profit at a per-project level. What business doesn't want that? HR tools You wouldn't manage your accounting, receivable or taxes via a spreadsheet, so why should your HR workflows rely on antiquated means and messy paperwork. GoCo.io is like a Quickbooks for HR & Benefits. It becomes your single central point of management for all HR needs, streamlining tedious workflows like employee on-boarding and off-boarding, document management, time off tracking, performance management, compliance and benefits administration to name a few. It seamlessly integrates with your existing payroll system as well as automatically transmits employee benefit selections and changes to your existing health insurance providers. If you are a business with employees to manage, GoCo.io will transform your workplace. Note-taking apps Even the sharpest minds forget important details sometimes. It's essential to take notes during meetings, on-the-go moments of inspiration, and those impromptu business interactions, but who wants to shuffle through notebooks and sheets of paper to find them later--not to mention try to decipher sloppy handwriting? Systems like Evernote give note-taking a much-needed tech upgrade. With this cloud-based app, you'll easily locate your most important notes via a keyword search, and can organize your notes in notebooks with tags. You can also streamline apps by creating to-do lists, or store photos of important details you need to draw on for business later. It's an entire filing system that you can access from any platform, wherever you go. Email management People often have a love-hate relationship with their email. It's a great, fast way to communicate--and yet it has a tendency to suck the hours from your day as you try to stay on top of that plethora of incoming messages. What's a savvy business person to do? The key to better productivity is email management. Front answers the call by integrating a team-oriented email management system with your existing apps and tools. Assign emails to team members, get real-time notifications when teammates are responding to conversations or archive emails, organize conversations with tags, and set them to snooze for later follow-up. Consider this the ultimate email upgrade. Business in the 21st century doesn't have to slow down your productivity. With the right tech systems in place, you can create structure in your day, and actually focus on getting things done--no matter where in the world your business takes you. Perks All the tools in the world will not help you to improve and maintain employee morale if the underlying tone of appreciation is absent. Employees who feel overworked and undervalued typically do one of two things (sometimes both): they lag behind in their productivity or they jump ship. The truth is, all business owners would be wise to ensure that their employees receive rewards for their work that extend beyond the typical paycheck. Keep your creme of the crop employees on board by starting with a good benefits package. Services that offer free lunch programs, haircuts and massages are just a few of the work perk benefits you can provide to your employees that can motivate them to produce their best work and stay with your company. Consider bringing in the cleaning staff from Cleanify to clear up your employee's working space, or the catering services from companies like Cater2Me for lavish lunches. Companies like Sooth, who provide massage services, can help you and your employees relax without ever leaving the office. Focusing on these perks have proven to improve employee productivity in the workplace and are a great way to drive employees to put in their best work. As you consider the types of benefits you'd like to give your employees, it's crucial to keep in mind that the people who come to work for you each day have a huge and influential role in the success of your company. You don't have to break the bank with your perks, but be sure that they reflect the weight and value of your employees.

STARTUP How One Startup Founder Borrowed the Best Bits of Google's Culture for His Own Company Can Google's "secret sauce" be replicated? One entrepreneur is trying to find out. By Glenn Leibowitz Glenn Leibowitz is the head of communications at a global management consulting firm. He writes about personal and professional development, media trends, and writing well. @GlennLeibowitz Contributor, Inc.com@GlennLeibowitz WRITE A COMMENT PeerStreet co-founders Brew Johnson and Brett Crosby. CREDIT: Courtesy Company Advertisement (Note: PeerStreet is not a client of mine, nor do I have any other business dealings with the company.) Besides great technology, boatloads of cash, and some of the most rigorous hiring practices on earth, Google has become what it is today thanks in no small part to the unique culture it has developed. Many startups emulate Google's culture in an effort to figure out the secret sauce to scaling up fast while building a company that attracts and retains great talent. Brett Crosby, a 10-year veteran of Google, is adopting some of the best bits of the internet giant's unique culture for his startup, PeerStreet. Based in Manhattan Beach, California, PeerStreet is an online marketplace that gives qualified individual investors, funds, and institutions the ability to invest directly in high-quality real estate loans. PeerStreet is giving investors access to real estate backed loans that otherwise would have only been available to large institutional investors. PeerStreet currently has over 60 employees and last year processed investments in loans worth nearly $200 million, after only its first full year of being open to the public. Last November, PeerStreet closed a $15 million Series A funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz, which they're using to hire more people to support their rapid expansion. To get the company to the next stage of growth, Crosby and his co-founder Brew Johnson are fashioning much of their startup's culture after Google, a company that he's intimately familiar with. Before starting PeerStreet with Johnson, Crosby worked at Google for a decade building up Google Analytics, a highly successful product that he had developed before Google acquired it from him and his co-founders at Urchin Software in 2005. The PeerStreet team "Google is famous for its awesome culture. You've gotta give credit to Larry, Sergey and Eric for their healthy disregard for tradition, willingness to try new stuff, and gravitation toward having fun. They are also very accepting of exceptional people no matter their eccentricities. We've adopted a lot of that culture here." I recently spoke with Crosby about some of the elements of Google's unique culture that he's trying to graft onto his fast-growing startup. The following are edited excerpts from our conversation: What elements of Google's famous culture are you adapting to PeerStreet, and how is that playing out so far? I worked for Google for nearly 10 years and saw the business when they had just gone public with 2,500 people. I interviewed and built teams, and helped Google grow from 2,500 people to north of 100,000. We went from a fairly local company in a single geography to a very global company in that time. I saw a lot of the best practices Google maintained in terms of hiring, how it thinks about hiring, and how it adapted over time. I saw how they worked to have an open and transparent company, both internally and externally, which I think is an important part of what we're doing at PeerStreet. One of the things I've adopted from Google is the idea of tech talks, which are great for a number of reasons. In a company like PeerStreet we have four major pillars to our business: technology, real estate, finance, and law. But most of these pillars don't intersect with each other very often, and it's rare that any individual we hire has experience in all four areas. We want to build a culture of personal growth at PeerStreet, so we are encouraging the sharing of knowledge, and providing training and education opportunities for our teams to deepen their understanding across a range of topics that might be relevant to them. We think that cultivating such a learning culture is quite important to our development. It's a nice thing we've adopted from Google and just one of the reasons we've been so fortunate in hiring incredibly high quality people. What kinds of topics have you covered in your tech talks? We've given tech talks about how to underwrite real estate loans, which is an important topic for the engineers and product people to understand. Our CTO did one about how to use Asana for project management. The engineering team uses Trello, but being a team player, he was looking out for the rest of us. And one of our most popular talks was on legal compliance issues, if you can believe that. It's important for the entire business to understand these things. Initially we were focused on doing tech talks led by our own employees. But we just recently started to invite external people to do tech talks, which was common at Google. Recent external speakers have included Adam Nash, former CEO of Wealthfront, Sam Marks from Invest Like A Boss, and Todd Lutwak from A16Z. Google is known for its TGIF sessions with top executives at the end of the week. How have you adopted those at PeerStreet? Every Friday at Google, they would have what they called TGIF (Thank God It's Friday). Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and other executives would discuss anything notable that happened over the previous week. Then they would open the floor to anyone companywide, and let them ask questions. Anyone could get up in front of a microphone and ask a question. Eventually, it got so popular, they started asking people to submit questions online. Google shifted this to Thursday to avoid overlapping with the start of the weekend on the east coast. We're small enough to do this once a week, but we switched it to earlier in the week to get people fired up for the week ahead. Brew and I get in front of the company every Monday and talk about "what's hot", what happened the previous week, and important events coming up. We also introduce new employees, show off new product features, review our metrics, and talk about the pipeline of loans we're going to make available for investment. It's a great way for people to keep up on all the stuff happening at a startup like ours that's moving at breakneck speed. We're also adding a new segment that we call "small moments of appreciation." We end those meetings by acknowledging the impact people are having in the company. It's a nice way for people to recognize their fellow employees. Google uses Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) to manage its massive, sprawling company. How is this approach to goal-setting working out at a startup like PeerStreet? OKRs have become really core to our business, something we definitely borrowed from Google. To be honest, I didn't enjoy doing OKRs much at Google, but as I moved up into management, I understood how OKRs helped people set their own goals, and how their goals then aligned with the objectives of the entire team. As we grew PeerStreet from a couple people to over 60 of us, I started hearing that people weren't sure how various initiatives fit into the bigger picture goals. PeerStreet's business is complicated, so that didn't surprise me too much. But when we did OKRs, it added a level of clarity and focus to our teams we never had before. It forced all of us to think through annual and quarterly goal setting for the company, each sub-team, and each person on each team. The idea is to set the top level objectives of the business. Then you have key results, which are designed to be measurable. Each individual in the team needs to be able to say, "these are the things I will be responsible for to help achieve these objectives." Everyone should know how what they're doing contributes to their own OKRs. Since adopting OKRs at PeerStreet, people have been able to focus on the key things they need to accomplish, which has reduced the overlapping of responsibilities dramatically. And perhaps most importantly, once people understood how their efforts fit into the whole picture, it gave their work more meaning. It's one thing that has really helped us focus the business and grow. It's responsible for a lot of our growth in 2016. PeerStreet needs to crunch a lot of data to determine the attractiveness and risk profile of potential real estate loans. How do you use big data and data analytics to make these decisions? Another thing that we borrowed from my experience at Google is how to use data to inform smarter decision-making. We use data all over the place, including tracking of OKRs, across each team. Probably the most important place we use data is in the underwriting of our loans. We look at the location and say what does the data tell us about that region right now, in the future and in the past. Fortunately, there is a lot of data related to the U.S. housing market. We can pull up a model for what the market looks like, at the submarket level, which can be more granular than the zip code.. What does the forecast look like: are housing prices going to increase? What does job growth look like? Crime statistics? Foreclosures? Are they trending up or down? Once we understand that, we look at the worst case scenario over the last 20 years and how each loan would have performed. If you look at it nationally this analysis won't give you the right picture, but in some submarkets it will. For example, some places in the U.S. were not affected much by the dotcom bust of the early 2000s, but Silicon Valley and San Francisco were impacted much more than the rest of the country. The opposite was true in 2008. Certain areas in Texas correlate more directly with oil booms and busts. Having access to detailed data at the submarket level is crucial. It helps us determine if a lender did its job when doing this loan. If not, this is probably not a loan we want to take on. Then we have a manual process on top of that. We don't give in completely to what the data says. Maybe there are other mitigating circumstances we need to take into consideration when a loan falls outside of our acceptable boundaries. We then get a valuation done on the property which is basically someone looking at the property and figuring how much it is worth. It is based on comparable data from other properties and physically looking at the actual property. And then we'll put the loan up for sale to our investors on the platform. Those are the high level details of our multi-step diligence process. The goal of our system is to create a company the can scale while maintaining the quality of our end investments.

As part of its never-ending effort to make the world a better place, Google has unveiled a number of initiatives to help transform the world. Ms. Pac Man Why Ms. Pac-Man and not the great Pac-Man himself? I’ve no idea, but it’s probably because Pac-Man already made his April Fool’s Day debut in 2015. To acquaint yourself with Ms. Pac-Man, simply open Google Maps, tap on the Ms. Pac-Man sprite and start playing! Your locality will be transformed into a Pac-Man-esque world with pellets strewn all over the roads. The game is alright, a bit buggy, but it’s definitely worth a shot. The ultimate VR experience See, the problem with virtual reality (VR) is that it’s not truly immersive. Human beings aren’t just about two senses, after all. What’s the point of virtually cooking an egg if you can’t taste it, right? Well, Google will fix that and you can help them do it! Just head here to sign up for Google’s Haptic Helpers program and volunteer to do your part in making someone’s VR experience that much more immersive. The ultimate communication tool What better way to make the world a better place than to build the most relaxing means of communication possible? In our increasingly disconnected society, it’s hard to ascertain the true intent of any form of communication. With tyrants and bigots in positions of power today, it’s easily possible that World War III will be the result of a typo. The only way to ensure a safe means of communication in this increasingly stressful environment is bubble wrap. Yes, you heard that right. Bubble wrap. Few things are more relaxing than bubble wrap. A soft, warm, purring cat, maybe. But you can’t use a cat to send messages now, can you? No. It had to be bubble wrap. This incredible new means of communication had to have come up in Japan, the home of zen and yin and yang and feng shui and bamboo and… you get the idea. The brainchild of Google Japan, the bubble wrap keyboard couldn’t be more perfect. You simply take a sheet of bubble wrap and start popping away at the bubbles. All digital forms of communication are binary and the pattern of popped and unpopped bubbles can be used to send a message. Anyone who receives a message in bubble wrap will know with certainty that the mind behind it was calm and collected. The best part? The receivers also have some bubble wrap to play with as they mull over a reply! The world will be a better place and all because of bubble wrap! Who knew? Winds of change Nature is unfair. What she gives with one hand, she takes away with the other. Africa struggles in the blistering heat while Greenlanders shiver in the never-ending winters. The Amazon sees perennial rain and California is dying under drought. It’s time we took back control from fickle Mother Nature! How do we do that? Yet again, Google has a solution, and it’s brilliant. Google engineers picked Holand as a proving ground, primarily because that place is brimming with windmills. What have windmills got to do with this, you ask? It’s quite simple, actually. Google used its machine learning chops to figure out wind patterns and cloud formations. It then put that knowledge to use in transforming windmills into wind generators. Enhancing Windmills with two-axis controllers and remote access, Google found a way to repurpose them to generate wind and blow the bad weather away. Take that, Mother Nature! Muahahaha. These weren’t all the projects that Google unveiled today. See if you can spot them all. If you do, there’s a small prize in it for you.

Google always does a great job, from the Pokemon Google Maps overlay to a smart mailbox, but there are a few from other companies worth mentioning. Here's a rundown of all the hillarious (or strange) tech-related April Fools Day jokes from around the web. Google Gnome One of Google's product launches from last year was the Google Home, a $129 smart speaker with Google Assistant. Now the company is teasing the "Google Gnome," an outside version of the Home. You can ask it weather questions, let it control your lawnmower and other tools, and even dress it up in accessories. The Google Gnome has a page on the Google Store, but unfortunately you can't buy it. I really want a rain coat for my Google Home, though. Mrs. Pac-Man in Google Maps For April Fools' 2015, Google added Pac-Man into Google Maps and Ingress. This year, Mrs Pac-Man is invading Google Maps. For regions of the world already on April 1st, a new Mrs. Pac-Man button is visible on the mobile app. You then have to control Mrs. Pac-Man on real-life streets, and of course, outrun the Ghosts. Google's Bubble Wrap Keyboard (English subtitles are available) Google Japan's prank is pretty funny - it's a bubble wrap keyboard. The idea is to pop bubbles on a bubble wrap sheet to form words, then feed the sheet through a reader to send the message. Some of the bubble wrap sheets are even scented. Google Assistant Google has plenty of Easter Eggs in Google Assistant, and as you might expect, there's one for April Fools' Day too. When asked, Assistant will offer advice on how not to get pranked, such as "If something seems too good to be true today, it probably is." Google Wind Google's Netherlands division has its own April Fools' Day gag, named 'Google Wind.' The idea is to use machine learning to control the weather, using Holland's famous windmills. I'll admit, this one is pretty great. Netflix Live Will Arnet has been in plenty of Netflix original content, from BoJack Horseman to A Series of Unfortunate Events. For April Fools' Day, Netflix is proud to share 'Netflix Live', which is nearly an hour of Arnett commentating ordinary events like toasting bread and completing a crossword puzzle. It's actually funnier than it sounds. You can watch the full thing here (a Netflix subscription is required). T-Mobile ONEsie T-Mobile's prank is a onesie, with "full-body coverage" and a built-in 4G LTE hotspot. You can actually buy it for $40, but the real one doesn't have any tech inside it. Hulu Hu With the claim that the human attention span has "dropped to eight seconds," Hulu has released 'Hu.' It's just a library of short clips from existing Hulu content, and you actually need an account to see them. This is probably the lamest April Fools' Day gag in the list - better luck next year, guys. OnePlus Dash drink OnePlus is really proud of its Dash Charge feature, even to the point of enlisting celebrities to talk about it. For April Fools', the company made real Dash Charge energy drinks. You can find our review of the drink here. Lyft Mono For April Fools' Day, Lyft has announced the 'Lyft Mono.' It's a wearable glove, vaguely resembling a Nintendo Power Glove. This gag is actually real, and once you put it on and get the app, sticking out your thumb will hail a Lyft cab. You can sign up to for a chance to get one here. Honor BFF We all need some positive reinforcement every now and then, right? Honor thinks so, and created the Honor BFF. This imaginary phone uses machine learning to periodically give you compliments and motivation. Hopefully it ships with Android 7.1 Nougat. Google Haptic Helpers This is probably my favorite gag so far. In order to create a more realistic virtual reality experience, you can schedule a "haptic helper" to come to your house and help create a more realistic environment. Just watch the video, it's hilarious. Amazon Petlexa Alexa is cool and all, but your furry friends need one too. As the name implies, Petlexa is Alexa for your pets. Contour by SlickWraps Putting a skin on your phone or tablet is too much work. For April Fool's Day, Slickwraps is teasing the 'Countour' - a machine that sprays on device skins. Frankly, I'm not sure if this is actually real or not, but there is a page for it on SlickWrap's store. Nvidia GTX G-Assist How many times have you been playing an online game, only to be interrupted by someone in real life? NVIDIA has made the 'G Assist,' a flash drive that can take over for you if you're busy. It can also help you beat boss battles, and provides periodic reminders to consume energy drinks. More information and a video can be found here. Google's data center on Mars If you have important data, you need a backup. That's why Google announced its first interplanetary data center, named "Ziggy Stardust," on the Google Cloud Platform Blog today. Located in the Gale Crater on Mars, it will store a cache of data from Earth to prevent irrecoverable loss when a planetary disaster strikes. Google hopes to finish the data center by 2018. LineageOS' mascot CyanogenMod's mascot, Cid, was one of the most recognizable icons in the Android community. As the spiritual successor to CyanogenMod, LineageOS has created its own mascot - 'Ink'. The project also announced 'Br0zip,' an artificial intelligence that can port LineageOS to any device in no time at all. Chromebook accessories Even though most Chromebooks can now run Android apps, you still can't use your Chromebook like an Android phone/tablet for all use cases. Until now, that is. Google has announced a Chromebook Groupie Stick (seen above), a Chromebook Cardboard headset, and a Chromebook armband. See the company's blog post for more info. Exynos Yoga Processor Remember when curved phones were a thing? Maybe we'll see more in the coming months, because Samsung has just unveiled the Exynos Yoga Processor - the first flexible mobile SoC. Anyone up for a Galaxy Flex? Carved screen protector Carved is a small Indiana-based phone case company, but now they are working on a wooden screen protector. Why hasn't this been done before? I'll take ten. I'm Feeling Woof/I'm Feeling Meow By force-touching the Google app icon in iOS, you can select "I'm Feeling Woof" or "I'm Feeling Meow." These give your pets access to the stuff they care about - from dog food to balls of yarn. More info can be found on Google's blog post. Waze maps for Mars According to the company's blog, Waze is has begun to map the surface of Mars. Certain members of the Waze community will also be sent to the Red Planet to more accurately map the surface. JerryRigEverything's NoPhone video If you haven't heard about it, the NoPhone is a solid piece of plastic designed to simulate the feeling of a phone in your pocket. I'm not really sure if anyone uses it, but JerryRigEverything is happy to break it just as much as any other phone. Google Translate for Heptapod B Using machine learning, Google Translate can now decrypt messages written in Heptapod B - the language from the film Arrival. On an unrelated note, it looks like someone from Google is still rocking a Nexus 10. See Google's blog post for more info. Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s ASUS has an April Fools gag too - the Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s Veritas Blue Limited Special Edition. I would probably buy this phone. MKBHD's Nokia 3310 review You may have heard about the updated Nokia 3310, but it turns out the original is an amazing smartphone. Okay, maybe not, but the video is pretty funny. Open GApps Femto Do you need to flash the latest Gapps package on your device, but you don't have a stable network connection? Not to worry, the Open GApps Femto package is here to help. It uses the United States HAARP service (which is not real, but just pretend) to download the latest GApps package. You can find more info at the GApps blog.   That concludes our coverage of April Fools' Day in the tech world. Let us know in the comments below which gag you liked the most!

Yeah they actuqally had me going until I compared a whois of kodi.tv vs kickasstorrents.com, a site that actually was seized. The whois data would show that it is not official. Derik Taylor So this is one I find interesting. Could it technically be a criminal offense to falsify a domain seizure? How would that work? mondeca I hope every year that Google will announce something real and awesome on April Fools' Day, like they did with Gmail. Once again, I am disappointed.

Trooper311 Gimme dat gnome yo. abqnm The Google Haptic Helpers was OK, until they applied the "I Voted!" sticker to the guy's shirt. I was laughing and crying at the same time. Corbin Davenport Yep, that had me laughing too. AdrianFDiratama . How about JG I'd actually like to see Google produce the Google Gnome.... All they'd need to do is add a battery (and Qi charging) to a Google Home and stick it in a new Gnome shell... Make sure its IP68 and maybe even MIL-STD-810G certified. It'd be a fun little gadget to put on the picnic table of your next summer back yard get together. Pump out some tunes, order pizza & Ubers for everyone to go home in, etc... Or take out when you work in the garden & don't want to get your phone dirty... Maybe even produce one with an LTE radio (and GPS). Then you could take it out of WiFi range camping. Wake up and find him chilling next to your tent in his little chair "Hey Google, how's today's weather? When does the rafting place open? How far away from the camp site is it?" cdotlawrence Maybe like a more customizable (from a looks standpoint), durable, & usable-on-go version of Home? Google Home Pro/Ultra? Interesting idea, but not sure why you wouldn't do most of the things it would do on your phone. Some specific use cases like you mentioned but beyond those, idk. Guess it'd be a highly functional, portable, durable and customizable speaker? Suicide_Note Ms. Pac-Man in Maps is live for me here in the US, even though it isn't April 1st yet. Daishi No Clarity Speaker??? Artem Russakovskii Why would that be in this post? Urmil Shroff What if we actually get the Mars data center many years from now? Eumelanin Knight I love this day. I just wish everyone kept up the pranks for the entire month like I do. Oddly enough.. I usually have less friends in May than I started with in April. How curious. Not sure why I brought that up.

The firm came under fire from the government last year for not paying its fair share to the exchequer and opposition politicians seized on the latest tax payment as a sign that the US tech giant was still not doing enough. Google insisted it paid “all the taxes due in the UK” but as an international firm it paid the majority of its taxes in its home country, the Press Association reported. PA Wire/PA Images Google paid £36.4 million in UK corporation tax for the year to June 30, 2016, the company has confirmed. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: “This revelation only further proves that Philip Hammond and Theresa May are more interested in cutting Google’s taxes, than making sure they are paying their fair share. “It seems that the so called ‘successful’ tax deal with Google that George Osborne boasted about last year has meant that they are still not paying their fair share under his successor Philip Hammond. “We urgently need clarity on HM Revenue and Customs’ relationship with Google and what reassurances have been provided to the company. “It is a national disgrace that by paying just £36 million in tax Google could have an effective tax rate lower than many working families in our country. And it exposes the complacency at the heart of this Tory Government, which is allowing this to still continue despite last year’s scandal.” Liberal Democrat treasury spokeswoman Baroness Kramer said: “It is appalling that Google are still getting away with paying such a paltry amount of their total revenue back in taxes. “Our worst fear is that the Tories would use Brexit to turn the UK into a tax haven sitting off the northern shores of Europe, there is no sign that this isn’t where we are headed. “This Government is already struggling with the Brexit squeeze, if they want to stop cutting vital services they need to start picking up what is owed to the British people.” PA Wire/PA Images John McDonnell slammed the system as a 'national disgrace' Meg Hillier, chairwoman of the influential Commons Public Accounts Committee (PAC), said: “Yet again we see a large corporation paying a rate of tax that belies its significant presence and business transactions in the UK. “This is why the PAC is working internationally to press for greater tax transparency so that we can all see clearly how much tax corporations pay and where. “This latest tax contribution from Google just underlines why this is so important.” The firm revealed it paid £36.4 million in UK corporation tax on pre-tax profits of £148.8 million in the year to June 30 2016. A Google spokesman said: “As an international business, we pay the majority of our taxes in our home country, as well as all the taxes due in the UK. “We have recently announced significant new investment in the UK, including new offices in Kings Cross for 7,000 staff.” The tech company paid £46.2 million in corporation tax for the previous 18 months to June 30 2015. That covered an extra six months of business before Google moved to a 12-month accounting period the following year. Google said both administrative costs and turnover for the period decreased as a result of the accounting changes. Revenue dropped £141 million in the year to June 30 2016 to £1 billion, from just under £1.2 billion for the previous 18 months. The company has faced mounting pressure over its tax affairs amid a backlash against corporate tax avoidance by multi-national companies. Google agreed to a controversial £130 million deal with HM Revenue & Customs in January last year to settle a 10-year tax inquiry into its UK business. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) declined to comment on Google’s tax payment, saying it did not discuss identifiable taxpayers. A spokesman said: “Everyone has to pay the tax due under the law and we do not settle for less. “Our most recent figures show that HMRC brought in a record £26 billion in extra tax for our public services, with £7.3 billion of that total coming from the 2,100 largest and most complex businesses in the UK.” SEE ALSO: Google Director’s Vow Over Tackling Illegal Content Google Has Revealed How Much Tax It Paid In 2016 Around 100 BBC Presenters Are Being Investigated For Alleged Tax Avoidance More: Uk News Uk Business Google John Mcdonnell Economics Suggest a correction Advertisement Suggested For You by Gravity Comments Advertisement Suggested For You Close SUBSCRIBE TO & FOLLOW UK DAILY BRIEF Learn more Newsletter 1.2 M 185 K 22.4 K Podcast Add us on Snapchat Corporation Tax System 'A National Disgrace', Says John McDonnell Following Google Revelations CONVERSATIONS Advertise RSS Careers FAQ User Agreement Privacy Comment Policy About Us About Our Ads Contact Us Archive "The Huffington Post UK" is provided by AOL (UK) Limited. © 2017 AOL (UK) Limited its affiliates and licensors.

Pac-Man on Google Maps :-) April Fools' Day prank? Pac-Man on Google Maps :-) April 01, 2017 15:05 IST We all know that Google has often played and posted prank videos and Easter Eggs on April Fools' Day.  This April Fool's Day you can play your retro Pac-Man game on Google Maps. Enjoy till it lasts, says Ashish Narsale. So, move over Pokemon, here comes the Pac-Man!   Just open Google Maps on your phone, tap the Yellow Pac-Man icon on the right and you are ready to play one of the most popular games ever developed... Pac-Man is an arcade game created by Japnese video game designer Toru Iwatani and developed by Namco Limited, a video game developer quite popular in the '80s.  Pac-Man was quite a rage then and still loved by gamers around the world.  Google had even created a Pac-Man doodle on May 21, 2010. If you search for Pac-Man you can still find that doodle. The Pac-Man game is a simple game played using just four arrow keys; on your smartphone just drag your finger to move the Pac-Man in the maze to eat the dots, but avoid the enemies touching the Pac-Man. The Pac-Man stops only when he hits the wall.  As Pac-Man eats all the dots, you move to the next level.  There are bigger dots in four corners known as pellets; when Pac-Man eats those pellets the enemy ghosts become inactive for sometime, allowing Pac-Man to kill the enemy and earn more points. We love the way Google brought this amazing game on every phone via Google Maps, even if lasts just for a day, and are sure that soon we will have more Pac-Man fans than those busy playing Pokemon. Enjoy the game this April Fools' Day because we are not sure if the game will still be there tomorrow on Google Maps. We all know that Google has often played and posted prank videos and Easter Eggs on April Fools' Day. Enjoy till it lasts.

Google App v6.16 beta prepares to add authentication to purchases with Assistant, video previews in search results, and more [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/03/30 1:36pm PDTMar 30, 2017 33 Plus 1 on G+ 64 Share on Facebook 39 Share on Twitter Total Shares136 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 Teardown 1.1 Video previews and auto-play 1.2 code 1.3 User-defined actions, meet IFTTT 1.4 code 1.5 Prevent accidental and unauthorized purchases (on phones) 1.6 code 1.7 Toggle for auto-added app icons 2 Download A new version of the Google app began rolling out earlier this week, but there don't appear to be any major changes going live quite yet. However, this version does bring some big clues about upcoming changes. On the docket for this teardown is a new authentication step for purchases made through Google Assistant, video previews in search results, user-defined actions take form through IFTTT, and some people will be happy to find out that Google's launcher won't always add icons for newly installed apps. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Video previews and auto-play These days, it's pretty common to perform a Google search and get back more than just a page of links to websites. In fact, it's almost weird not to get back at least a few video suggestions, image results, or even knowledge graph info. With regular results, you'll see text previews that tell you what to expect when you get to a page. However, videos don't afford the same clues about what you're going to get, only a thumbnail, and it's usually chosen by the creator. That's going to change as Google prepares to show video previews in search results. The evidence for video previews actually comes in the form of a new setting (not currently live) that will allow users to turn video previews off. Seeing as people aren't actually seeing video previews in search results, this is a pretty good hint of what's to come. This wouldn't be Google's first foray into showing video previews, it actually became a feature on the web search results around early 2011. Users could click on a little magnifying glass for "instant previews" of pages and videos. That feature vanished at some point, but there's no denying that it can be pretty useful. code <string name="video_preference_title">Video</string> <string name="video_preview_autoplay_on_mobile_data_title">Network</string> <string name="video_preview_autoplay_on_wifi_preference_desc">Play video previews automatically on Wi-Fi</string> <string name="enable_video_preview_autoplay">Autoplay</string> <string name="enable_video_preview_autoplay_on_mobile_data">Allow on mobile networks</string> <string name="enable_video_preview_autoplay_on_mobile_data_preference">enableVideoPreviewAutoplayOnMobileDataPreference</string> <string name="enable_video_preview_autoplay_preference">enableVideoPreviewAutoplayPreference</string> <string name="enable_video_preview_network_preference_category">enableVideoPreviewNetworkPreferenceCategory</string> /res/xml/video_preference_header.xml <preference-headers xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"> <header android:id="@id/video_header" android:title="@string/video_preference_title" android:fragment="com.google.android.apps.gsa.staticplugins.videopreference.VideoPreferenceFragment" /> </preference-headers> /res/xml/video_preference.xml <PreferenceScreen android:id="@id/video_preference_screen" xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"> <SwitchPreference android:persistent="false" android:title="@string/enable_video_preview_autoplay" android:key="@string/enable_video_preview_autoplay_preference" android:summary="@string/video_preview_autoplay_on_wifi_preference_desc" android:defaultValue="true" /> <PreferenceCategory android:title="@string/video_preview_autoplay_on_mobile_data_title" android:key="@string/enable_video_preview_network_preference_category"> <SwitchPreference android:persistent="false" android:title="@string/enable_video_preview_autoplay_on_mobile_data" android:key="@string/enable_video_preview_autoplay_on_mobile_data_preference" android:defaultValue="false" /> </PreferenceCategory> </PreferenceScreen> I won't go into making predictions about web results, but it's pretty clear mobile users are going to see video previews when they use Google's search bar. How will they work and what will they look like? That I can't say for sure, but the evidence strongly suggests they'll actually auto-play, which means the thumbnails will probably disappear shortly after coming into view and frames of the video will begin running. I assume they won't begin playing audio, because that would be horrible. The auto-play setting all of this is based upon will obviously be useful for turning this feature off, which you may want to do for data conservation, or if you simply find sudden motion annoying. Wi-Fi and cellular connections can be enabled or disabled individually, but the defaults are naturally set so only Wi-Fi is enabled when this feature goes live. The one thing I notice that's missing is a way to start a preview if the auto-play setting is switched off. Perhaps this isn't included in the app itself, but will be delivered as part of Google's results, or maybe that's not actually going to be a feature, but it leads me to think Google might not be ready to launch this quite yet. User-defined actions, meet IFTTT Back in August, shortly after Google Assistant code first appeared in public releases, we got a look at the early stages of user-defined actions. When launch day came, there was no obvious sign that this feature had actually made the cut, nor were there many changes to any related text or resources since then. That is, until now. New strings reveal that Google is integrating the popular IFTTT (If-This-Then-That) service to handle custom user actions. code <string name="user_defined_action_ifttt_action_section_title">IFTTT actions</string> <string name="user_defined_action_menu_save_button">Save</string> <string name="user_defined_action_paused_action_section_title">Paused actions</string> <string name="user_defined_action_speech_recognition_prompt_text">When I say Okay Google…</string> <string name="user_defined_action_target_command_hint">Google Assistant should do</string> <string name="user_defined_action_action_list_section_title">Learned actions</string> <string name="user_defined_action_create_action_section_title">Teach your assistant to…</string> <string name="user_defined_action_create_do_action_title">Do something</string> <string name="user_defined_action_create_ifttt_action_title">Create IFTTT action</string> <string name="user_defined_action_create_say_action_title">Say something</string> <string name="user_defined_action_delete_confirmation_cancel_text">CANCEL</string> <string name="user_defined_action_delete_confirmation_delete_text">DELETE</string> <string name="user_defined_action_delete_confirmation_text">Are you sure you want to delete this action?</string> New Layouts /res/layout/assistant_user_defined_action_do_editor_layout.xml /res/layout/assistant_user_defined_action_say_editor_layout.xml New preference screen /res/xml/user_defined_action_preference_screen.xml <PreferenceScreen xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"> <com.google.android.apps.gsa.assistant.settings.shared.CustomPreferenceCategory android:key="@string/assistant_settings_create_action_header_key" android:order="0" /> <com.google.android.apps.gsa.assistant.settings.shared.CustomPreferenceCategory android:key="@string/assistant_settings_active_action_category_key" android:order="1" /> <com.google.android.apps.gsa.assistant.settings.shared.CustomPreferenceCategory android:key="@string/assistant_settings_paused_action_category_key" android:order="2" /> <com.google.android.apps.gsa.assistant.settings.shared.CustomPreferenceCategory android:key="@string/assistant_settings_ifttt_action_category_key" android:order="3" /> </PreferenceScreen> <string name="assistant_settings_active_action_category_key">assistantSettingsUserDefinedActionActiveActionsCategoryKey</string> <string name="assistant_settings_create_action_header_key">assistantSettingsUserDefinedActionCreateActionHeaderKey</string> <string name="assistant_settings_ifttt_action_category_key">assistantSettingsUserDefinedActionIFTTTActionsCategoryKey</string> <string name="assistant_settings_paused_action_category_key">assistantSettingsUserDefinedActionPausedActionsCategoryKey</string> This might feel a bit anticlimactic since many of us have already been using IFTTT with Google Assistant. There's no reason to expect changes to that base functionality, Google is simply building a native interface for creating these actions. On the plus side, it means we don't have to use IFTTT's website... And that's definitely a good thing. (It's not a great site.) ifttt_logo There are also no clues to indicate how capable these actions are going to be. IFTTT's "Applets" are effectively made up of two parts: a service that triggers an event, and the action that is performed in response. In this case, the trigger is obviously going to be Google Assistant, and it will listen for a user-defined phrase. What isn't clear is how much control users will have to define the resulting actions; basically, if they'll have the same range of services and options for configurability as they would on the site, or if the interface will offer a limited set of options. Prevent accidental and unauthorized purchases (on phones) Purchases made through voice-activated gadgets have been a bit of a hot topic lately, particularly thanks to a series of incidents involving the Amazon Echo. A few weeks ago, Google Assistant gained some similar shopping capabilities; and while there haven't been any reports of accidental or unauthorized purchases yet, it's only a matter of time unless something is done to prevent it. Google is already working on a solution. According to new text in the app, users will soon have the option to require an additional authentication step before purchases can be completed. At this time, the only standard method of authentication is a fingerprint, which should be enough for most people. Of course, if you are using a device without a fingerprint reader, or chose not to set up a fingerprint for use on your phone, this won't do much for you. It's also noted that if authentication is set to not be required, "suspicious behavior" may still trigger a check.

It's safe to assume there's a plan for Google Home and other voice-only appliances using Assistant, but there's nothing visible yet to indicate how that will work. I would expect a proper solution is still pending the rollout of multiple accounts on Home, at which point the signed-in users will all probably be able to perform the authentication steps on their phones to complete purchases started on Home. This should hopefully put an end to any concerns about accidental and unauthorized purchases resulting from misunderstood conversations, ambient noise, demanding children, or friends with a penchant for pranks. Toggle for auto-added app icons Finally, we get to one of those little features that seem simple, but many people are bothered to no end if they aren't available. I'm talking about the launcher's behavior of automatically adding an icon to a home screen when a new app is installed. Most third-party launchers offer users the freedom to disable this, and it's hit-and-miss for OEMs. Google's launcher counts among the ranks that doesn't give users a choice, but that's about to change. <string name="auto_add_shortcuts_label">Add icon to Home screen</string> <string name="auto_add_shortcuts_description">For new apps</string> From /xml/launcher_preferences.xml <SwitchPreference android:persistent="true" android:title="@string/auto_add_shortcuts_label" android:key="pref_add_icon_to_home" android:summary="@string/auto_add_shortcuts_description" android:defaultValue="true" /> There's not really much more to say about this other than it's placement, which will be at the bottom of the Settings screen alongside the toggles for app suggestions and allow rotation. I'm not sure why it wasn't already activated in this release, but maybe Google is waiting to roll it out remotely at some point in the near future.

Isn't it the same function? Suicide_Note That's what i was thinking too. F4LL0U7 Came here to say the same thing. Is there anyone that doesn't already uncheck that box immediately when setting up a new device? Not sure I'd expect to rely on the launcher for that. Also might cause confusion if it's enabled in one place but disabled in the other. abqnm Some third party launchers have their own independent system that doesn't rely on the Play Store setting. But Google and a few third party launchers respect that option. I guess the only thing that's really new here is that it would be an option in the settings for the Google launchers. bekifft Would be nice if they'd implement app shortcuts. Cody Toombs That's already there, but it only works on Android 7.1 and above. bekifft Well that's weird cause I have a Nexus 6P running latest software, all I get are "edit" and "remove". Pan Szym True destinyhud then u r not using google now launcher bekifft No that's true, I'm using Nova, but on literally all sides of the Google app icon are icons with working app shortcuts, some of them are even Google apps. Keep, Chrome, Phone, etc. destinyhud Nova has to implement ur app shortcut. the api to enable shortcut is there but if your launcher app didn't implement it you wont see it. Google now launcher which comes with the 6p has app shortcut enabled for most of google apps Cody Toombs Oh, you meant you want the Google app to have app shortcuts. I thought you were asking for the Google launcher to support them (since plenty of people are still confused by how that works). So my question is... What shortcuts do you think it's supposed to have? I can't think of very many things I'd want to have in the app, short of possibly a quick way to reach Settings. bekifft Reminders is the big one for me. If they'd just add that it would be good. Lion5 I have Android 6x on my Galaxy Note 5 and with Nova, App shortcuts seem to work with quite a few apps. Most are the basic edit, remove, etc, but some like Google's apps offer more shortcuts.

George Osborne launches his own fashion line Undeterred by criticism of his potential conflicts of interest, the former chancellor has launched a fashion house which will produce “high-quality, hi-visibility industrial garments aimed at the multitasking CEO”.  He will juggle heading up the 'Georgio' brand with his six other jobs, which include editing the Evening Standard newspaper and sitting as MP for Tatton. The line will also feature Mr Osborne's trademark hard hat/ high-visibility jacket combination.  (The Guardian)  Prince Harry has secretly married his girlfriend in Vegas Prince Harry and his American girlfriend Meghan Markle have tied the knot in a "low key" Las Vegas ceremony, The Daily Mail reports. The couple flew to Vegas separately, and wore disguises as they waited at the city's Marriage Bureau to avoid detection.  A palace insider said: "Harry prefers to stay out of the limelight. He hopes Her Majesty will understand his reasons".  Morning! I'm with the marvellous @EllyOldroyd and @Dom_bbc @bbc5live Are you an April Fools fan?

Instead, the standing-only service, which was abolished in 1956, will be re-branded as “Super Economy” or “Rush Hour Plus” with 45cm-wide circles painted on the floor to indicate each traveller’s “personal space”. (The i) Donald Trump hires Piers Morgan (The Metro/Getty) Piers Morgan has been appointed as President Trump's Showbusiness Advisor, the White House announced this morning. A source close to the President told The Metro that Mr Morgans’ role will include coaching Mr Trump on how to engage most effectively in Twitter feuds, having had extensive experience in this field. The 52-year-old Good Morning Britain host will also work to improve the President's image among the film industry, after he was mocked at the Golden Globes ceremony in January. Google launches new "Google Gnome" home assistant Following the success of Google Home  the tech giant will launch a 'Google Gnome' artificial intelligence assistant designed for outdoor usage Google also posted a YouTube video showcasing the capabilities of its outdoor smart speaker.  Google Gnome can tell the wind speed, perform gardening tasks, and play music on request. Germany will hold referendum on adopting Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) The German government will hold in-out referendum on leaving Central European Time (CET), its UK embassy has announced today. Germans will decide whether to leave the 17 nation bloc which observes CET later this year. The Leave campaign hope to install a replica of Greenwich's Shepherd Gate Clock in Alexanderplatz, East Berlin, in a "frivolous symbolic gesture". Frau Sommerzeit, a government spokesperson known to be a CET-sceptic, said that the change represented a "unique opportunity to further improve Germany's global competitiveness".

In fact, saying that these are fine phones is an understatement. India Today Tech will take a better look at the device in reviews when they launch in India, but even from whatever Samsung has told so far it is easy to see that these phones are at top of their game. But amidst all the goodness that the Galaxy S8 seem to pack in its sleek metal and glass body, there is one part that seems to have got the raw deal, and that is the rear camera. The rear camera in the Galaxy S8 didn't get much stage time when Samsung released these two phones. For that the reason could be as innocuous as the fact that Samsung didn't have enough time to talk about everything sweet and nice in these phones. But a more likely possibility is that Samsung didn't have much to talk about the Galaxy S8 cameras because the hardware is very similar to what the company used last year in the Galaxy S7. Also Read: Samsung Galaxy S8 & S8+ have a weird fingerprint scanner but that's okay Overall, the only new bits in the rear camera of the Galaxy S8 come in the form of software improvements. Samsung says that it now makes it easier for users to access various modes in the phone's camera app as well as uses multi-photo method to improve photo quality. On the front, the Galaxy S8 comes with an improved selfie camera that clicks 8-megapixel images unlike the 5-megapixel camera in the Galaxy S7. Where is the dual camera? It's not that the Galaxy S8 camera is going to be shabby. The Galaxy S7 camera is utterly fantastic in most circumstances and the Galaxy S8 is going to be similar. Reports says the Galaxy S8 does have a newer image sensor in the form of Sony-made IMX333. Although this too will click 12-megapixel images, just like the IMX260 inside the Galaxy S7, it is possible that there is some fine-tuning in the sensor that may help Galaxy S8 manage better photos. Then the same F1.7 lens, which does duty in the Galaxy S7, is there inside the Galaxy S8. In other words, in most cases you will be probably click the same sort of fantastic photos with the Galaxy S8 that you can capture with the Galaxy S7. And that might be the problem. The Galaxy S7 is already a pretty good shooter. And that poses a problem for Samsung. How do you improve a camera that is already so good? In future we will get better answers The Galaxy S7 is already a pretty good shooter. And that poses a problem for Samsung. How do you improve a camera that is already so good? In future we will get better answers. But for now, there is some hint coming from Apple and Google, two companies that sell premium phones like the iPhone and the Pixel. Apple too faces the dilemma similar to what Samsung does. It too already has phones that can click some amazing photos. So how does it make something that is already good even better? Last year, Apple answered that question with the dual-camera setup in the iPhone 7 Plus. The image sensor size (and pixel quality) in the iPhone 7 Plus was more or less similar to what was there in the iPhone 6 Plus. But by adding a different lens with longer focal length (56mm) to the camera, Apple suddenly changed the game. The extra lens not only allows iPhone 7 Plus users to click more candid photos with a closer and different perspective, but also use modes like Portrait that help shoot better people photos. And more significantly dual camera in the iPhone 7 Plus makes it a more fun to use camera because of the "zoom" that second lens provides. Google, meanwhile, hasn't jumped on the dual camera bandwagon. But it is pursuing a different path in search of a great camera phone. It is putting an extremely large image sensor in its phones -- Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P were first, followed by the Pixel and the Pixel XL. The quality of image sensor inside the Pixel phones is really good. And that is why the Pixel phones, when combined with Google's fantastic HDR+ mode, use photos that have lots of details and rich colours. The large pixel size of the IMX378, which is the sensor inside the Pixel phones, also helps these Google phones click fabulous low light pictures. Missed chance for Samsung?But the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8 Plus neither go the large-sensor route and nor for the dual camera feature. And that I think is a missed opportunity. I have no doubt that the Galaxy S8 will click amazing photos. It will be one of the best phones to click photo.  But compared to the best in the business, which is Pixel and the iPhone 7 Plus, it seemingly looks a little behind the curve. Technically, and that does make the photos clicked with Pixel stand out, the Galaxy S8 camera may not match the wonder that is Google's phone, especially when used to shoot photos in low light. And on the fun part, it may not match what the iPhone 7 Plus offers, or what Apple's upcoming iPhone 8 Plus, which is bound to have dual camera, may offer. Also Read: Galaxy S8+ and Galaxy S8: 10 features that make these Samsung phones unique In fact, the absence of dual camera on the Galaxy S8 is really surprising. Nowadays, almost all the high-end phones are coming with one. LG G6 has dual cameras, although I suspect LG's camera may not be as fun to use as the one in the iPhone 7 Plus. The LG G6 camera has wide angle lens as an extra and the using that for different perspective is more difficult compared to using a telephoto lens. Then there are phones from Huawei, which are using dual lens cameras to great effect, particularly to shoot low light scenes. The Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8 Plus neither go the large-sensor route and nor for the dual camera feature. And that is probably a missed opportunity The companies that are not doing the dual-lens cameras will probably do it this year. May be Samsung too will do it, but with the next Note device. May be Samsung is working on some new camera tech but that wasn't ready in time for the Galaxy S8. May be I am judging the Galaxy S8 camera by its specification sheet and too early.

If you want to pick up the skill more employers will be looking for in the future, heed the advice of executives from a global leader in technology. In an interview with CNBC, both Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Google's parent company Alphabet and Jonathan Rosenberg, adviser to CEO Larry Page , say that data analytics will become increasingly important in workplaces. "I think a basic understanding of data analytics is incredibly important for this next generation of young people," Schmidt tells CNBC. "That's the world you're going into." "By data analytics," the executive chairman says, "I mean a basic knowledge of how statistics works, a basic knowledge of how people make conclusions over big data." Focusing more on data analytics will help businesses too, the executives say. Hiring professionals with the right skills and a penchant for bold, creative thinking was a strategy that drove Google's innovation, Schmidt and Rosenberg write in a recently updated version of their book, "How Google Works." According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the number of roles for individuals with this skills set is expected to grow by 30 percent over the next seven years, well above average. Data analysts make sense of large amounts of information using statistical tools and techniques. They're able to pinpoint trends and correlations using programs such as Excel, SAS and SQL and Tableau. They typically study statistics, data science or math. Schmidt says that being able to use calculus would be a great asset to an employee, but an understanding of how to approach big data would still be very helpful in finding a job. Rosenberg agrees. "My favorite statement that echoes Eric's," he says," is 'Data is the sword of the 21st century, those who wield it well, the samurai.'" The quote comes from an internal memo Rosenberg sent to employees in 2009, following the inauguration of President Barack Obama. "Everyone should be able to defend arguments with data," he writes in the memo. "Information transparency helps people [...] determine who is telling the truth."

It's that time of year again: Some tech companies are presenting their wackiest fake ideas to trick you into thinking those crazy products are actually coming to market. Here's a roundup of notable April Fools' tech pranks this year. Don't get your hopes set you'll be able to take home one of these outlandish products. Google Smart homes? Google is doubling down on smart gnomes. The Google Gnome device will give homeowners the "connected yard" of their dreams. Just walk outside and speak your command, and Google's army of helper gnomes will come to the rescue. You can find the device in the Google Store or the Made by Google site. Google Maps If you don't need to get to your destination in a hurry, Google Maps added a Ms. Pac-Man mode to further distract you from your task at hand. To play, open your Google Maps app and click on the pink Ms. Pac-Man icon on the right side of the screen. The idea is recycled from 2015's Pac-Man integration, but hey, if it isn't broke, then don't fix it. Chegg Education technology company has released a new energy drink called "Chugg." Powered by "a crap ton of caffeine" and "ground up unicorn horns," alleged testimonials claim you can down this drink, not sleep for 72 hours and write an entire thesis. Honda (Tokyo Stock Exchange: 7267.T-JP) Ok, Honda isn't a tech company, but this is pretty good. Instead of your standard honk, "Honda Horn Emojis" will play a themed tune appropriately tied to a illustrated expression button on your steering wheel. Hulu Don't have time to watch your favorite show? Hulu's Hu abbreviates not only its name, but shortens episodes into eight seconds (or slightly more) to capture your fleeting attention. T-Mobile You'll never go without service when you're wearing your T-Mobile ONEsie. Slip on this wearable tech made from nano technology and you'll be fully covered, whether through full bars service or literally all-over fitness tracking. Prysm Telecommuting has evolved, thanks to the Prysm Avatar. Send your drone to work, and it will project a full-sized hologram of you in your office. Wardrobe options include a "programmer" t-shirt look, a "Silicon Valley" hoodie outfit, and a business casual suit. Note: CNBC parent company NBCUniversal is an investor in Hulu. And the Best Place to Work in the global financial markets 2016 is... CNBC More articles from CNBC @CNBC CNBC is the recognized world leader in business news, providing real-time financial market coverage and business information to nearly 800 million homes worldwide, with headquarters on 3 continents and 20 bureaus around the globe.

Google always does a great job, from the Pokemon Google Maps overlay to a smart mailbox, but there are a few from other companies worth mentioning. Here's a rundown of all the hillarious (or strange) tech-related April Fools Day jokes from around the web. Google Gnome One of Google's product launches from last year was the Google Home, a $129 smart speaker with Google Assistant. Now the company is teasing the "Google Gnome," an outside version of the Home. You can ask it weather questions, let it control your lawnmower and other tools, and even dress it up in accessories. The Google Gnome has a page on the Google Store, but unfortunately you can't buy it. I really want a rain coat for my Google Home, though. Mrs. Pac-Man in Google Maps For April Fools' 2015, Google added Pac-Man into Google Maps and Ingress. This year, Mrs Pac-Man is invading Google Maps. For regions of the world already on April 1st, a new Mrs. Pac-Man button is visible on the mobile app. You then have to control Mrs. Pac-Man on real-life streets, and of course, outrun the Ghosts. Google's Bubble Wrap Keyboard (English subtitles are available) Google Japan's prank is pretty funny - it's a bubble wrap keyboard. The idea is to pop bubbles on a bubble wrap sheet to form words, then feed the sheet through a reader to send the message. Some of the bubble wrap sheets are even scented. Google Assistant Google has plenty of Easter Eggs in Google Assistant, and as you might expect, there's one for April Fools' Day too. When asked, Assistant will offer advice on how not to get pranked, such as "If something seems too good to be true today, it probably is." Google Wind Google's Netherlands division has its own April Fools' Day gag, named 'Google Wind.' The idea is to use machine learning to control the weather, using Holland's famous windmills. I'll admit, this one is pretty great. Netflix Live Will Arnet has been in plenty of Netflix original content, from BoJack Horseman to A Series of Unfortunate Events. For April Fools' Day, Netflix is proud to share 'Netflix Live', which is nearly an hour of Arnett commentating ordinary events like toasting bread and completing a crossword puzzle. It's actually funnier than it sounds. You can watch the full thing here (a Netflix subscription is required). T-Mobile ONEsie T-Mobile's prank is a onesie, with "full-body coverage" and a built-in 4G LTE hotspot. You can actually buy it for $40, but the real one doesn't have any tech inside it. Hulu Hu With the claim that the human attention span has "dropped to eight seconds," Hulu has released 'Hu.' It's just a library of short clips from existing Hulu content, and you actually need an account to see them. This is probably the lamest April Fools' Day gag in the list - better luck next year, guys. OnePlus Dash drink OnePlus is really proud of its Dash Charge feature, even to the point of enlisting celebrities to talk about it. For April Fools', the company made real Dash Charge energy drinks. You can find our review of the drink here. Lyft Mono For April Fools' Day, Lyft has announced the 'Lyft Mono.' It's a wearable glove, vaguely resembling a Nintendo Power Glove. This gag is actually real, and once you put it on and get the app, sticking out your thumb will hail a Lyft cab. You can sign up to for a chance to get one here. Honor BFF We all need some positive reinforcement every now and then, right? Honor thinks so, and created the Honor BFF. This imaginary phone uses machine learning to periodically give you compliments and motivation. Hopefully it ships with Android 7.1 Nougat. Google Haptic Helpers This is probably my favorite gag so far. In order to create a more realistic virtual reality experience, you can schedule a "haptic helper" to come to your house and help create a more realistic environment. Just watch the video, it's hilarious. Amazon Petlexa Alexa is cool and all, but your furry friends need one too. As the name implies, Petlexa is Alexa for your pets. Contour by SlickWraps Putting a skin on your phone or tablet is too much work. For April Fool's Day, Slickwraps is teasing the 'Countour' - a machine that sprays on device skins. Frankly, I'm not sure if this is actually real or not, but there is a page for it on SlickWrap's store. Nvidia GTX G-Assist How many times have you been playing an online game, only to be interrupted by someone in real life? NVIDIA has made the 'G Assist,' a flash drive that can take over for you if you're busy. It can also help you beat boss battles, and provides periodic reminders to consume energy drinks. More information and a video can be found here. Google's data center on Mars If you have important data, you need a backup. That's why Google announced its first interplanetary data center, named "Ziggy Stardust," on the Google Cloud Platform Blog today. Located in the Gale Crater on Mars, it will store a cache of data from Earth to prevent irrecoverable loss when a planetary disaster strikes. Google hopes to finish the data center by 2018. LineageOS' mascot CyanogenMod's mascot, Cid, was one of the most recognizable icons in the Android community. As the spiritual successor to CyanogenMod, LineageOS has created its own mascot - 'Ink'. The project also announced 'Br0zip,' an artificial intelligence that can port LineageOS to any device in no time at all. Chromebook accessories Even though most Chromebooks can now run Android apps, you still can't use your Chromebook like an Android phone/tablet for all use cases. Until now, that is. Google has announced a Chromebook Groupie Stick (seen above), a Chromebook Cardboard headset, and a Chromebook armband. See the company's blog post for more info. Exynos Yoga Processor Remember when curved phones were a thing? Maybe we'll see more in the coming months, because Samsung has just unveiled the Exynos Yoga Processor - the first flexible mobile SoC. Anyone up for a Galaxy Flex? Carved screen protector Carved is a small Indiana-based phone case company, but now they are working on a wooden screen protector. Why hasn't this been done before? I'll take ten. I'm Feeling Woof/I'm Feeling Meow By force-touching the Google app icon in iOS, you can select "I'm Feeling Woof" or "I'm Feeling Meow." These give your pets access to the stuff they care about - from dog food to balls of yarn. More info can be found on Google's blog post. Waze maps for Mars According to the company's blog, Waze is has begun to map the surface of Mars. Certain members of the Waze community will also be sent to the Red Planet to more accurately map the surface. JerryRigEverything's NoPhone video If you haven't heard about it, the NoPhone is a solid piece of plastic designed to simulate the feeling of a phone in your pocket. I'm not really sure if anyone uses it, but JerryRigEverything is happy to break it just as much as any other phone. Google Translate for Heptapod B Using machine learning, Google Translate can now decrypt messages written in Heptapod B - the language from the film Arrival. On an unrelated note, it looks like someone from Google is still rocking a Nexus 10. See Google's blog post for more info. Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s ASUS has an April Fools gag too - the Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s Veritas Blue Limited Special Edition. I would probably buy this phone. MKBHD's Nokia 3310 review You may have heard about the updated Nokia 3310, but it turns out the original is an amazing smartphone. Okay, maybe not, but the video is pretty funny. Open GApps Femto Do you need to flash the latest Gapps package on your device, but you don't have a stable network connection? Not to worry, the Open GApps Femto package is here to help. It uses the United States HAARP service (which is not real, but just pretend) to download the latest GApps package. You can find more info at the GApps blog.   That concludes our coverage of April Fools' Day in the tech world. Let us know in the comments below which gag you liked the most!

Greg Abbott https://kodi.tv/ Sergio Carmona Scariest one... seriously... Artem Russakovskii Not even a 503 or something? Just a 200? Ballsy re: SEO. SickoPsycho oops- beat me to it. Yeah they actuqally had me going until I compared a whois of kodi.tv vs kickasstorrents.com, a site that actually was seized. The whois data would show that it is not official. Derik Taylor So this is one I find interesting. Could it technically be a criminal offense to falsify a domain seizure? How would that work? mondeca I hope every year that Google will announce something real and awesome on April Fools' Day, like they did with Gmail. Once again, I am disappointed.

Corbin Davenport Yep, that had me laughing too. AdrianFDiratama . How about JG I'd actually like to see Google produce the Google Gnome.... All they'd need to do is add a battery (and Qi charging) to a Google Home and stick it in a new Gnome shell... Make sure its IP68 and maybe even MIL-STD-810G certified. It'd be a fun little gadget to put on the picnic table of your next summer back yard get together. Pump out some tunes, order pizza & Ubers for everyone to go home in, etc... Or take out when you work in the garden & don't want to get your phone dirty... Maybe even produce one with an LTE radio (and GPS). Then you could take it out of WiFi range camping. Wake up and find him chilling next to your tent in his little chair "Hey Google, how's today's weather? When does the rafting place open? How far away from the camp site is it?" cdotlawrence Maybe like a more customizable (from a looks standpoint), durable, & usable-on-go version of Home? Google Home Pro/Ultra? Interesting idea, but not sure why you wouldn't do most of the things it would do on your phone. Some specific use cases like you mentioned but beyond those, idk. Guess it'd be a highly functional, portable, durable and customizable speaker? Suicide_Note Ms. Pac-Man in Maps is live for me here in the US, even though it isn't April 1st yet.

Google always does a great job, from the Pokemon Google Maps overlay to a smart mailbox, but there are a few from other companies worth mentioning. Here's a rundown of all the hillarious (or strange) tech-related April Fools Day jokes from around the web. Google Gnome One of Google's product launches from last year was the Google Home, a $129 smart speaker with Google Assistant. Now the company is teasing the "Google Gnome," an outside version of the Home. You can ask it weather questions, let it control your lawnmower and other tools, and even dress it up in accessories. The Google Gnome has a page on the Google Store, but unfortunately you can't buy it. I really want a rain coat for my Google Home, though. Mrs. Pac-Man in Google Maps For April Fools' 2015, Google added Pac-Man into Google Maps and Ingress. This year, Mrs Pac-Man is invading Google Maps. For regions of the world already on April 1st, a new Mrs. Pac-Man button is visible on the mobile app. You then have to control Mrs. Pac-Man on real-life streets, and of course, outrun the Ghosts. Google's Bubble Wrap Keyboard (English subtitles are available) Google Japan's prank is pretty funny - it's a bubble wrap keyboard. The idea is to pop bubbles on a bubble wrap sheet to form words, then feed the sheet through a reader to send the message. Some of the bubble wrap sheets are even scented. Google Assistant Google has plenty of Easter Eggs in Google Assistant, and as you might expect, there's one for April Fools' Day too. When asked, Assistant will offer advice on how not to get pranked, such as "If something seems too good to be true today, it probably is." Google Wind Google's Netherlands division has its own April Fools' Day gag, named 'Google Wind.' The idea is to use machine learning to control the weather, using Holland's famous windmills. I'll admit, this one is pretty great. Netflix Live Will Arnet has been in plenty of Netflix original content, from BoJack Horseman to A Series of Unfortunate Events. For April Fools' Day, Netflix is proud to share 'Netflix Live', which is nearly an hour of Arnett commentating ordinary events like toasting bread and completing a crossword puzzle. It's actually funnier than it sounds. You can watch the full thing here (a Netflix subscription is required). T-Mobile ONEsie T-Mobile's prank is a onesie, with "full-body coverage" and a built-in 4G LTE hotspot. You can actually buy it for $40, but the real one doesn't have any tech inside it. Hulu Hu With the claim that the human attention span has "dropped to eight seconds," Hulu has released 'Hu.' It's just a library of short clips from existing Hulu content, and you actually need an account to see them. This is probably the lamest April Fools' Day gag in the list - better luck next year, guys. OnePlus Dash drink OnePlus is really proud of its Dash Charge feature, even to the point of enlisting celebrities to talk about it. For April Fools', the company made real Dash Charge energy drinks. You can find our review of the drink here. Lyft Mono For April Fools' Day, Lyft has announced the 'Lyft Mono.' It's a wearable glove, vaguely resembling a Nintendo Power Glove. This gag is actually real, and once you put it on and get the app, sticking out your thumb will hail a Lyft cab. You can sign up to for a chance to get one here. Honor BFF We all need some positive reinforcement every now and then, right? Honor thinks so, and created the Honor BFF. This imaginary phone uses machine learning to periodically give you compliments and motivation. Hopefully it ships with Android 7.1 Nougat. Google Haptic Helpers This is probably my favorite gag so far. In order to create a more realistic virtual reality experience, you can schedule a "haptic helper" to come to your house and help create a more realistic environment. Just watch the video, it's hilarious. Amazon Petlexa Alexa is cool and all, but your furry friends need one too. As the name implies, Petlexa is Alexa for your pets. Contour by SlickWraps Putting a skin on your phone or tablet is too much work. For April Fool's Day, Slickwraps is teasing the 'Countour' - a machine that sprays on device skins. Frankly, I'm not sure if this is actually real or not, but there is a page for it on SlickWrap's store. Nvidia GTX G-Assist How many times have you been playing an online game, only to be interrupted by someone in real life? NVIDIA has made the 'G Assist,' a flash drive that can take over for you if you're busy. It can also help you beat boss battles, and provides periodic reminders to consume energy drinks. More information and a video can be found here. Google's data center on Mars If you have important data, you need a backup. That's why Google announced its first interplanetary data center, named "Ziggy Stardust," on the Google Cloud Platform Blog today. Located in the Gale Crater on Mars, it will store a cache of data from Earth to prevent irrecoverable loss when a planetary disaster strikes. Google hopes to finish the data center by 2018. LineageOS' mascot CyanogenMod's mascot, Cid, was one of the most recognizable icons in the Android community. As the spiritual successor to CyanogenMod, LineageOS has created its own mascot - 'Ink'. The project also announced 'Br0zip,' an artificial intelligence that can port LineageOS to any device in no time at all. Chromebook accessories Even though most Chromebooks can now run Android apps, you still can't use your Chromebook like an Android phone/tablet for all use cases. Until now, that is. Google has announced a Chromebook Groupie Stick (seen above), a Chromebook Cardboard headset, and a Chromebook armband. See the company's blog post for more info. Exynos Yoga Processor Remember when curved phones were a thing? Maybe we'll see more in the coming months, because Samsung has just unveiled the Exynos Yoga Processor - the first flexible mobile SoC. Anyone up for a Galaxy Flex? Carved screen protector Carved is a small Indiana-based phone case company, but now they are working on a wooden screen protector. Why hasn't this been done before? I'll take ten. I'm Feeling Woof/I'm Feeling Meow By force-touching the Google app icon in iOS, you can select "I'm Feeling Woof" or "I'm Feeling Meow." These give your pets access to the stuff they care about - from dog food to balls of yarn. More info can be found on Google's blog post. Waze maps for Mars According to the company's blog, Waze is has begun to map the surface of Mars. Certain members of the Waze community will also be sent to the Red Planet to more accurately map the surface. JerryRigEverything's NoPhone video If you haven't heard about it, the NoPhone is a solid piece of plastic designed to simulate the feeling of a phone in your pocket. I'm not really sure if anyone uses it, but JerryRigEverything is happy to break it just as much as any other phone. Google Translate for Heptapod B Using machine learning, Google Translate can now decrypt messages written in Heptapod B - the language from the film Arrival. On an unrelated note, it looks like someone from Google is still rocking a Nexus 10. See Google's blog post for more info. Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s ASUS has an April Fools gag too - the Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s Veritas Blue Limited Special Edition. I would probably buy this phone. MKBHD's Nokia 3310 review You may have heard about the updated Nokia 3310, but it turns out the original is an amazing smartphone. Okay, maybe not, but the video is pretty funny. Open GApps Femto Do you need to flash the latest Gapps package on your device, but you don't have a stable network connection? Not to worry, the Open GApps Femto package is here to help. It uses the United States HAARP service (which is not real, but just pretend) to download the latest GApps package. You can find more info at the GApps blog.   That concludes our coverage of April Fools' Day in the tech world. Let us know in the comments below which gag you liked the most!

All they'd need to do is add a battery (and Qi charging) to a Google Home and stick it in a new Gnome shell... Make sure its IP68 and maybe even MIL-STD-810G certified. It'd be a fun little gadget to put on the picnic table of your next summer back yard get together. Pump out some tunes, order pizza & Ubers for everyone to go home in, etc... Or take out when you work in the garden & don't want to get your phone dirty... Maybe even produce one with an LTE radio (and GPS). Then you could take it out of WiFi range camping.

This is no prank, there’s now a fun way to kill time when you’re lost in the middle of nowhere. 'Air crash hero' jailed following series of 'repulsive' sex assaults on schoolgirls The tech giant has recreated the beloved 1981 cult classic on the mobile app for one day only. But instead of the original maze, you’ll be running away from the bug-eyed ghosts along Oxford Street, Brighton Pier or the Highlands (depending where you are). Ms Pac-Man was first released in 1981 (Picture: Google Maps) There are two versions – iPhone users can play at their current location where Android users will be taken to a random spot in the world. Dog poo vigilante slapped with behaviour ban And it’s not exactly a hidden feature. Just open the app and you’ll see the a little Ms Pac-Man icon on the right. Ms Pac-Man came out one year after the original Pac-Man debuted in 1980. It started out as an arcade game (Picture: Getty Images) Both games are virtually the same, except Ms Pac-Man has the trademark pink bow and a different theme tune. People who distribute revenge porn to face harsher punishments But Google didn’t stop there, today it also unveiled its Google Gnome app for homeowners who want a smart yard. It’s the equivalent of Google Home and tells users the weather, what plants are edible and reminds humanity that we’re all destined to become compost. It’s also a joke.

Send me a copy:   http://mybs.in/2UUqIu6 ALSO READ Toshiba likely to miss quarterly earnings deadline: Sources Toshiba offers memory chip shares as collateral for loans: Sources Toshiba shares fall over possible lawsuit by several Japanese banks Google acquires Kaggle for undisclosed amount to boost data play Taiwan's Foxconn 'confident' to buy into Toshiba chip business Google and Amazon joined a list of potential buyers eyeing Toshiba's lucrative memory chip business as the Japanese conglomerate seeks bidders to cover huge losses, a newspaper said on Saturday. Toshiba has reportedly completed the first round of bidding for its prized memory chip business, seen as key for the cash-strapped company to turn itself around. Some 10 foreign companies and funds, including Google and Amazon, tendered bids, the mass-circulation Yomiuri Shimbun said, quoting unnamed sources. The two US tech giants are expected to use Toshiba's memory chips for their cloud services, the daily said. Taiwan's Hon Hai, which acquired Japanese electronics maker Sharp last year, has apparently bid more than 2 trillion yen ($18 billion), the daily said. Immediate confirmation of the report was not available. Toshiba shares jumped more than five percent on Friday after local media reported that bidders included Apple, US private-equity firm Silver Lake Partners and American chipmaker Broadcom. Toshiba is expected to negotiate with individual candidates this month. Local media said any foreign buyer would need to pass a Japanese government review, given concerns about security around systems already using Toshiba's memory chips. Toshiba is the world's number two supplier of memory chips for smartphones and computers, behind South Korea's Samsung, and the business accounted for about a quarter of its 5.67 trillion yen in revenue last fiscal year. The news report came after angry investors lambasted Toshiba executives at a shareholders meeting over its warning that annual losses could balloon to more than $9.0 billion. The red ink is largely tied to huge cost overruns and construction delays at its US nuclear power unit Westinghouse Electric, which filed for bankruptcy protection late March.

Take your FirstStep Google, Amazon eye Toshiba's lucrative memory chip business Toshiba is expected to negotiate with individual candidates this month Toshiba is expected to negotiate with individual candidates this month Google and Amazon joined a list of potential buyers eyeing Toshiba's lucrative memory chip business as the Japanese conglomerate seeks bidders to cover huge losses, a newspaper said on Saturday. Toshiba has reportedly completed the first round of bidding for its prized memory chip business, seen as key for the cash-strapped company to turn itself around. Some 10 foreign companies and funds, including Google and Amazon, tendered bids, the mass-circulation Yomiuri Shimbun said, quoting unnamed sources. The two US tech giants are expected to use Toshiba's memory chips for their cloud services, the daily said. Taiwan's Hon Hai, which acquired Japanese electronics maker Sharp last year, has apparently bid more than 2 trillion yen ($18 billion), the daily said. Immediate confirmation of the report was not available. Toshiba shares jumped more than five percent on Friday after local media reported that bidders included Apple, US private-equity firm Silver Lake Partners and American chipmaker Broadcom. Toshiba is expected to negotiate with individual candidates this month. Local media said any foreign buyer would need to pass a Japanese government review, given concerns about security around systems already using Toshiba's memory chips. Toshiba is the world's number two supplier of memory chips for smartphones and computers, behind South Korea's Samsung, and the business accounted for about a quarter of its 5.67 trillion yen in revenue last fiscal year. The news report came after angry investors lambasted Toshiba executives at a shareholders meeting over its warning that annual losses could balloon to more than $9.0 billion. The red ink is largely tied to huge cost overruns and construction delays at its US nuclear power unit Westinghouse Electric, which filed for bankruptcy protection late March.

Waxman Apr 01, 2017 Google has a new line of games and an iOS app update designed for pets? Fur real? Nope. The two gags are just elaborate April Fools' Day pranks created by the search engine company. "Google Play for Pets" is supposed to be a new category of apps and games designed for pets in the Play Store. The other prank is a temporary update to the search engine company's iOS app called "I'm feeling Meow or I'm feeling Woof." The feature will display " images that a dog or cat would find enticing (like “raw tuna” and “dog toys.”)," the company said in a statement. "Think of it as 'I’m feeling lucky,' but for our furry friends. If you’d like to take this pet project of ours for a walk, go to 'settings' in the iOS app and change it to ' I’m feeling Woof or I’m feeling Meow."' Google  Google  The fake apps are the latest April Fools' Day gags from the search company, which also unveiled a feature in Google Maps on Friday that allows users to play Ms. Pac-Man in any area, as well as a commercial for a fake product called "Google Gnome" designed to help users with outdoor chores.

Google always does a great job, from the Pokemon Google Maps overlay to a smart mailbox, but there are a few from other companies worth mentioning. Here's a rundown of all the hillarious (or strange) tech-related April Fools Day jokes from around the web. Google Gnome One of Google's product launches from last year was the Google Home, a $129 smart speaker with Google Assistant. Now the company is teasing the "Google Gnome," an outside version of the Home. You can ask it weather questions, let it control your lawnmower and other tools, and even dress it up in accessories. The Google Gnome has a page on the Google Store, but unfortunately you can't buy it. I really want a rain coat for my Google Home, though. Mrs. Pac-Man in Google Maps For April Fools' 2015, Google added Pac-Man into Google Maps and Ingress. This year, Mrs Pac-Man is invading Google Maps. For regions of the world already on April 1st, a new Mrs. Pac-Man button is visible on the mobile app. You then have to control Mrs. Pac-Man on real-life streets, and of course, outrun the Ghosts. Google's Bubble Wrap Keyboard (English subtitles are available) Google Japan's prank is pretty funny - it's a bubble wrap keyboard. The idea is to pop bubbles on a bubble wrap sheet to form words, then feed the sheet through a reader to send the message. Some of the bubble wrap sheets are even scented. Google Assistant Google has plenty of Easter Eggs in Google Assistant, and as you might expect, there's one for April Fools' Day too. When asked, Assistant will offer advice on how not to get pranked, such as "If something seems too good to be true today, it probably is." Google Wind Google's Netherlands division has its own April Fools' Day gag, named 'Google Wind.' The idea is to use machine learning to control the weather, using Holland's famous windmills. I'll admit, this one is pretty great. Netflix Live Will Arnet has been in plenty of Netflix original content, from BoJack Horseman to A Series of Unfortunate Events. For April Fools' Day, Netflix is proud to share 'Netflix Live', which is nearly an hour of Arnett commentating ordinary events like toasting bread and completing a crossword puzzle. It's actually funnier than it sounds. You can watch the full thing here (a Netflix subscription is required). T-Mobile ONEsie T-Mobile's prank is a onesie, with "full-body coverage" and a built-in 4G LTE hotspot. You can actually buy it for $40, but the real one doesn't have any tech inside it. Hulu Hu With the claim that the human attention span has "dropped to eight seconds," Hulu has released 'Hu.' It's just a library of short clips from existing Hulu content, and you actually need an account to see them. This is probably the lamest April Fools' Day gag in the list - better luck next year, guys. OnePlus Dash drink OnePlus is really proud of its Dash Charge feature, even to the point of enlisting celebrities to talk about it. For April Fools', the company made real Dash Charge energy drinks. You can find our review of the drink here. Lyft Mono For April Fools' Day, Lyft has announced the 'Lyft Mono.' It's a wearable glove, vaguely resembling a Nintendo Power Glove. This gag is actually real, and once you put it on and get the app, sticking out your thumb will hail a Lyft cab. You can sign up to for a chance to get one here. Honor BFF We all need some positive reinforcement every now and then, right? Honor thinks so, and created the Honor BFF. This imaginary phone uses machine learning to periodically give you compliments and motivation. Hopefully it ships with Android 7.1 Nougat. Google Haptic Helpers This is probably my favorite gag so far. In order to create a more realistic virtual reality experience, you can schedule a "haptic helper" to come to your house and help create a more realistic environment. Just watch the video, it's hilarious. Amazon Petlexa Alexa is cool and all, but your furry friends need one too. As the name implies, Petlexa is Alexa for your pets. Contour by SlickWraps Putting a skin on your phone or tablet is too much work. For April Fool's Day, Slickwraps is teasing the 'Countour' - a machine that sprays on device skins. Frankly, I'm not sure if this is actually real or not, but there is a page for it on SlickWrap's store. Nvidia GTX G-Assist How many times have you been playing an online game, only to be interrupted by someone in real life? NVIDIA has made the 'G Assist,' a flash drive that can take over for you if you're busy. It can also help you beat boss battles, and provides periodic reminders to consume energy drinks. More information and a video can be found here. Google's data center on Mars If you have important data, you need a backup. That's why Google announced its first interplanetary data center, named "Ziggy Stardust," on the Google Cloud Platform Blog today. Located in the Gale Crater on Mars, it will store a cache of data from Earth to prevent irrecoverable loss when a planetary disaster strikes. Google hopes to finish the data center by 2018. LineageOS' mascot CyanogenMod's mascot, Cid, was one of the most recognizable icons in the Android community. As the spiritual successor to CyanogenMod, LineageOS has created its own mascot - 'Ink'. The project also announced 'Br0zip,' an artificial intelligence that can port LineageOS to any device in no time at all. Chromebook accessories Even though most Chromebooks can now run Android apps, you still can't use your Chromebook like an Android phone/tablet for all use cases. Until now, that is. Google has announced a Chromebook Groupie Stick (seen above), a Chromebook Cardboard headset, and a Chromebook armband. See the company's blog post for more info. Exynos Yoga Processor Remember when curved phones were a thing? Maybe we'll see more in the coming months, because Samsung has just unveiled the Exynos Yoga Processor - the first flexible mobile SoC. Anyone up for a Galaxy Flex? Carved screen protector Carved is a small Indiana-based phone case company, but now they are working on a wooden screen protector. Why hasn't this been done before? I'll take ten. I'm Feeling Woof/I'm Feeling Meow By force-touching the Google app icon in iOS, you can select "I'm Feeling Woof" or "I'm Feeling Meow." These give your pets access to the stuff they care about - from dog food to balls of yarn. More info can be found on Google's blog post. Waze maps for Mars According to the company's blog, Waze is has begun to map the surface of Mars. Certain members of the Waze community will also be sent to the Red Planet to more accurately map the surface. JerryRigEverything's NoPhone video If you haven't heard about it, the NoPhone is a solid piece of plastic designed to simulate the feeling of a phone in your pocket. I'm not really sure if anyone uses it, but JerryRigEverything is happy to break it just as much as any other phone. Google Translate for Heptapod B Using machine learning, Google Translate can now decrypt messages written in Heptapod B - the language from the film Arrival. On an unrelated note, it looks like someone from Google is still rocking a Nexus 10. See Google's blog post for more info. Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s ASUS has an April Fools gag too - the Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s Veritas Blue Limited Special Edition. I would probably buy this phone. MKBHD's Nokia 3310 review You may have heard about the updated Nokia 3310, but it turns out the original is an amazing smartphone. Okay, maybe not, but the video is pretty funny. Open GApps Femto Do you need to flash the latest Gapps package on your device, but you don't have a stable network connection? Not to worry, the Open GApps Femto package is here to help. It uses the United States HAARP service (which is not real, but just pretend) to download the latest GApps package. You can find more info at the GApps blog.   That concludes our coverage of April Fools' Day in the tech world. Let us know in the comments below which gag you liked the most!

Yeah they actuqally had me going until I compared a whois of kodi.tv vs kickasstorrents.com, a site that actually was seized. The whois data would show that it is not official. Derik Taylor So this is one I find interesting. Could it technically be a criminal offense to falsify a domain seizure? How would that work? mondeca I hope every year that Google will announce something real and awesome on April Fools' Day, like they did with Gmail. Once again, I am disappointed.

Peterson Silva "Frankly, I'm not sure if this is actually real or not" Well then THAT ought to be the best one! Trooper311 Gimme dat gnome yo. abqnm The Google Haptic Helpers was OK, until they applied the "I Voted!" sticker to the guy's shirt. I was laughing and crying at the same time. Corbin Davenport Yep, that had me laughing too. AdrianFDiratama . How about JG I'd actually like to see Google produce the Google Gnome.... All they'd need to do is add a battery (and Qi charging) to a Google Home and stick it in a new Gnome shell... Make sure its IP68 and maybe even MIL-STD-810G certified. It'd be a fun little gadget to put on the picnic table of your next summer back yard get together. Pump out some tunes, order pizza & Ubers for everyone to go home in, etc... Or take out when you work in the garden & don't want to get your phone dirty... Maybe even produce one with an LTE radio (and GPS). Then you could take it out of WiFi range camping. Wake up and find him chilling next to your tent in his little chair "Hey Google, how's today's weather? When does the rafting place open? How far away from the camp site is it?" cdotlawrence Maybe like a more customizable (from a looks standpoint), durable, & usable-on-go version of Home? Google Home Pro/Ultra? Interesting idea, but not sure why you wouldn't do most of the things it would do on your phone. Some specific use cases like you mentioned but beyond those, idk. Guess it'd be a highly functional, portable, durable and customizable speaker? Suicide_Note Ms. Pac-Man in Maps is live for me here in the US, even though it isn't April 1st yet. Daishi No Clarity Speaker??? Artem Russakovskii Why would that be in this post? Urmil Shroff What if we actually get the Mars data center many years from now? Eumelanin Knight I love this day. I just wish everyone kept up the pranks for the entire month like I do. Oddly enough.. I usually have less friends in May than I started with in April. How curious. Not sure why I brought that up.

Skip to content Skip to main navigation News Mumbo Opinion Events Australia Asia Subscribe Home News Dr Mumbo Opinion FYI Subscribe to newsletter Features ‘We are family’: Havas CEO Yannick Bolloré on his legacy, $4bn fortune, big China deal and Snapchat snobbery The youthful chief executive officer of Havas, French native Yannick Bolloré, opens up to Mumbrella Asia’s Dean Carroll on what lies ahead for his company and the rapidly-changing ad industry March 30, 2017 3:47 by Dean Carroll 0 To start off, what’s the latest on Google, YouTube and Havas ad spends on programmatic – it all seems to have got rather messy? “Brand safety is important for our clients. We had the trouble in the UK because some YouTube ads went into the wrong environment. As we do all the time when something like that happens, we proposed to our clients in the UK that they paused their investments until the environment is safe again. And we are working hard with Google there to find a solution. “But that is not our global position, it’s only a problem in the UK. Google is still a very valuable platform for us and it’s very effective for our clients. “Any story relating to Google always has a large echo so it was all over the press. It has led to an intense discussion between the brands, the media agencies and Google. But we were one of the first agencies to create a meta-quality barometer, which makes sure that the environment where we buy programmatically is safe.” And what does the episode tell us about the role of media agencies now? “This incident shows how young the digital industry is. It’s at the very early stages so we as an industry are still making some mistakes. But what it also shows is that the role of media agencies is key. “Last year, people were asking me whether media agencies were still relevant in a world where Google goes directly to service its inventory to clients. What happened in the UK proves that the role of media agencies is still central in the world of media buying because only we can let our clients know what are the pros and cons, and risks, of working directly with a media owner. To conclude, we will continue investing to make sure that our clients ads appear only in the right environments.” You recently opened the Havas European HQ in London. Isn’t it a weird time to do so given Brexit and Britain’s decision to turn away from the European Union? “When we took the decision to open the HQ there, we didn’t know that Brexit would happen. Being honest with you, it was a surprise. After discussing it for a couple of months, we decided to maintain our investment in the UK because we believe the country will continue to be one of the biggest economic centres in the world. “I am sure they will find a treaty that allows the UK to work with other countries in the EU. I am in London a lot and I’m really not worried for the future there.” You’ve said previously that India will be the biggest advertising market within two decades and China is obviously a global juggernaut already. Where else in Asia do you see massive growth? “Well, China is the second largest advertising market in the world after the US and all the research suggests China will become the largest ad market in the world so we are looking to find scale there through acquisitions and partnerships. We want to find a strong local partner and we are expecting to finalise such a deal this year. “We already have a strong hub in Singapore from where we manage South East Asia and that represents 2,400 Havas employees across 17 countries. Singapore and Shanghai are the two key hubs for us with a little bit of Hong Kong too. And we have a strong operation in Australia with 400 employees. “You have to fish where the fishes are and the vast majority of the international headquarters of our clients are located in these places.”   You also said recently that “politics doesn’t have much of an impact” on your business and the media. Is that really true – Trump, Brexit, the rise of Marine Le Pen – none of these political issues affect your revenue in a negative way? “Often, the opposite will actually be true. Everybody told us that Brexit would be a big drama, but we have had a very strong year-end in the UK and the outlook also looks very positive. People are talking about a crash in the UK, but if you go to London you will see that all the restaurants are full and the people are motivated, and joyful. “In the US, people were predicting economic turmoil following the Trump election. But the situation there is very positive too. So political happenings do not always have the effect people expect. “In France, as a citizen, of course I could have some concerns. But at the end of the day, the Havas Group has been here for 182 years. And whatever happens politically I have no doubt that we will still be here in the future. So in the medium to long-term, I am really not worried at all.” There are 20,000 Havas employees around the world. Is that a weight on your shoulders, to think that all of these people are depending on you to keep them in work at a time when the global economy is weak and the media and marketing industry is in a period of consolidation at best, and managed decline at worst? “No because we have a very strong management team all around the world as well as a clear strategy and vision so I’m very well supported by strong leaders. Therefore, it’s really not a burden. “Having managed smaller scale companies too, I even think that it’s easier to manage a global group because you have the opportunity to work with great talent. If you have the right teams in place, it is much easier to find growth and to manage it.” The average age of a Havas employee is 27. That suggests the upper echelons of management are not overly top-heavy. Do you have certain processes in place to prevent that happening? I mean, you also said last year you wouldn’t hire anybody who is not on Snapchat. “What I said was that I wouldn’t hire anybody who thinks Snapchat is only for kids. It’s important to remain curious in life when you are living in a world of such rapid change. When you work in advertising, you need to be able to target the millennials and for that you need to understand how these new platforms are working. “Someone who thinks he is too old to try Snapchat would not be the right fit for for us at Havas because we need to be able to service our clients in targeting every segment of the population. It is important to remain young in your head whatever age you are. Every member of the Havas family around the world must embrace innovation. Too often, people are scared to leave their comfort zones. However, you have to keep evolving in order to understand new trends.” So just how much does Havas spend on Snapchat compared to other mediums like Google, Facebook, television, radio, newspapers and magazines or outdoor? “It’s just the beginning so I would be more comfortable to answer that question in a year from now. We are just now starting the discussions with Snapchat and advertisers. But generally digital is now becoming the number one in media, before TV. “Google is, of course, the number one digital player and Facebook the number two. For now, those two are taking the lion’s share of digital advertising. Maybe we will have a new player like Snapchat or another platform that will gain market share. But at the moment, Google and Facebook are very persuasive in convincing clients.” Changing topic, Havas Group revenue growth was 17.3 per cent in 2015 and just 3.3 per cent in 2016. What are your projections for 2017? “It is still too early to say for sure, but I think 2017 will look like 2016 more or less. To be in an industry growing somewhere between 2 and 4 per cent is already really good. Some of our clients would be over the moon, if their industries were growing by 2 to 4 per cent.” How is the merging of Havas of creative and media into one under your new village model coming along? There must be some teething problems to overcome, getting the suits and the creatives to view themselves as one and the same. Have you moved beyond the Game of Thrones moment to something a bit more collaborative? “It depends on the country because each place has its own legacy in terms of the organisational structure. But for me the right model is to have everyone in the right place working hand-in-hand with each other. “It’s important that our creative people are informed on media innovation and they understand how the media landscape works. So if you just put your TVCs on Snapchat, it will never work. Social media ads, for example, are very different to traditional formats. And on mobile, people are often looking at ads without sound. Everything is changing and it’s important for creative to understand that. “And, at the same time, media people need to be creative and to understand how content works. In the media world, 10 years ago you could pay for people’s attention. Today, you need to earn people’s attention with good content. Especially when people are using ad blockers. “Creative and media needs to work together. There is no other choice. It will take some time, but we do need to create a much more integrated offering in order to meet the client expectations.” Do you then disagree then with those that say it is ‘The age of the independent agency’ being able to provide fleet-of-foot bespoke solutions, while the big networks are slow to respond because their processes are rigid? “The local independent agencies will always be there for the more specific tasks, but the largest advertisers need to have access to global networks and when it comes to digital they need the access to tools. The only way to get the best tools is to have the scale to invest in these tools. “We are not really competing with independent agencies. Sometimes we are partnering with them, although for me it’s not really the same world that the big ad groups and the independent shops occupy.” When are Vivendi (French media giant) and Havas going to merge, giving the synergies and your position at the senior level in both companies? Or do European Union antitrust laws prevent this scenario from ever occurring? “There have been a lot of rumours, but I don’t want to comment on rumours. Both the companies are listed so I’m not allowed to disclose anything. But I can tell you that today no discussions are happening between the two groups. As the Vivendi CEO said ‘time will tell’.” Is there any other mergers and acquisitions activity on the horizon for Havas beyond the deal in China you are working on – what are your other expansion plans for the future, if any? “Yeah, well I’d love to close the China deal this year. That’s very important for me and for our clients. We are happy that we bought RIverorchid, which is the biggest player in IndoChina. We will also perhaps look at something in North East Asia this year. Otherwise, we also have expansion plans in both the United States and Europe.” A bit of a curveball for you now. According to Forbes, you are worth approximately US$4bn. Do you find it difficult to stay motivated with that sort of family wealth behind you? “The question makes me smile. Of course it’s not a cash fortune, but an equity fortune and we own the company as a family. The Bolloré Group has been around for two centuries, it was created in 1822. So I would love for my daughters to one day be working in this company and their children after them and so on. “It is about making this family company last for the next century. It’s really not about the wealth, but doing something with your life.” And you’ve indicated that you’ll still be at the head of the company in 20 years from now and that this creates certainty and stability for clients and shareholders. But given how quickly artificial intelligence is evolving and how it is predicted that software will do most jobs in the future, is that a realistic prediction? Won’t the robots be doing everything for you two decades from now? “It’s true that I can’t tell you how the company will be in 20 years because it is changing so fast. My duty is to take the right decisions now that ensure the company adapts to the new paradigm that will exist in 20 years. You know, Havas was very different 20 years ago than it is today. We will adapt as with Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution. “I would love to have an army of robots, but in the creative industries you need to have a human brain. I can’t believe that one day an algorithm will be able to create the same magic as a human brain so I think I will still need to be there in 20 years, along with my senior management team, to still create great campaigns.” You play tennis to a high level and you run marathons as well as having a large family and being a global CEO. How do you find the time for all of that? Can you run us through your average day and outline your work-life balance? “I have a great family and we spend a lot of time together at the weekends. During the week it’s not very easy, but I am trying to come back to Paris for at least a third of my time. I always aim to spend at least 20 to 30 minutes together with the family every day. “Technology now is a game-changer. It means when I’m in Asia, South America or New York, for example, I can Skype with them or FaceTime them. I always have that daily interaction with my daughters thanks to these tools. “And then during school holidays, my family will join me wherever I have to go in the world. Maybe I’m crazy, but I feel like I spend a good amount of time with them. I try to do all of my work between 8am and 9pm, although the last two months with the reorganisation have meant that hasn’t always been possible.” Finally, what differentiates Havas from the competition in your view and what industry game-changing things are you working on that will ensure you remain ahead of the curve? “We have agility so that means we can move at speed. And even more important than that is the capacity we have to work for the long term. Being owned by the family group means Havas is not focused only on short-term quarterly earnings. Instead, we are focused on building the group for the future and the next generation. “I am serious when I say that one day I hope my young daughters will be working alongside me here. That means I take decisions on the basis that they will be fruitful in the next decade. I don’t think about just cutting costs in order to have a good year in 2017. Rather, we think about how to invest in the right structure, the right people and the right tools. All my brothers and sisters work in the Bolloré Group so it’s really a family company.” Dean Carroll Dean is the publisher at Mumbrella Asia.

Google changed the sign-in page several times throughout the years. The last change of the sign-in page dates back to 2015 which Google announced in pretty much the same way. Google changed the design of the page back then, and switched from a single sign-on page to a two-page sign in form. The company has asked for the username on the first page, and for the password on the second page ever since. Google notes that the new design won't change the functionality of the sign in page at all. The steps remain the same to sign in to a Google account, and users will enter the same information to do so. The company mentions three benefits of the new page. Have a cleaner, simpler look. Make the sign-in process faster. Be consistent across computers, phones, and tablets. Here is a screenshot of the new sign-in page:   Google wants to provide anyone, regardless of device that is used to access the page, to see the same sign-in page. The new page will look the same regardless of whether you are using a PC or Mac, an iPhone or iPad, or an Android device. There are exceptions however. The company notes that users may continue to see the old sign-in page if they use an older version of a browser, or have JavaScript turned off. Google does not define "older version of a browser" on the page. It is unclear whether this means that you will have to run the latest version of Chrome or Firefox for instance, or if older refers to certain technologies that are required to render the new sign-in page correctly. Google users on Android or iOS may have noticed the new sign-in page already on their devices. Android users when they add a new account to their device through Settings > Accounts, iOS users when they use the Google application on the system. Tip: Make sure you have set up 2-factor authentication for your Google Account as it improves the security of the account significantly. The new sign-in page will certainly surprise some users. One reason why Google is making the announcement early is to reduce the impact on the bulk of users. Now You: what is your take on the change?

People hated it and raised hell on Google's own forums. But Google chose to force the new design on users, despite the protests and outrage. Now, instead of doing what their customers want, Google continues to force their customers to go through two separate pages just to login. Well, "customers" is the wrong word to describe Google users. "Merchandise" is much more accurate. Google does what Google wants. And if you use their services, YOU are the merchandise. And as merchandise, your voice really doesn't matter. Reply Rick A. April 1, 2017 at 1:33 pm # i've never understood why they do that. And to make it worse, Yahoo does that with their e-mail and Microsoft does that with outlook . com. Does anybody know why? is their a benefit to doing that ?

Okay, that is actually three words. Reply beemeup4 April 2, 2017 at 3:38 am # Two page login acts as a security measure against phishing sites that make fake Google login pages that look like the real one. With a real Google login, your display name is shown on the 2nd page where you enter your password, whereas a fake site would not know your display name. The Bank of America login page used to have something similar where they had you choose a custom image and image name, which they would display before you enter your password, with the logic that a fake BofA login page would not have this data. Sadly BofA removed this security function and offered no replacement to help users defend against potential fake sites aside from opting to use the SafePass 2FA.

Luma 2-pack is $179 ($71 off) on The Home Depot for today only Martim Lobao Follow View All Posts 2017/03/31 4:15pm PDTMar 31, 2017 5 Plus 1 on G+ 14 Share on Facebook 36 Share on Twitter Total Shares55 Deals We've been seeing more and more competition among mesh Wi-Fi networking kits over the past few months, with even Google dipping its toe into the segment with Google Wifi back in October of last year. One big advantage Google Wifi has over some of its competitors that have been on the market for a while longer is price: whereas a three-pack from eero would set you back $499 and $399 from Luma, one from Google costs only $299. To make up for that, many companies have been lowering their prices significantly, with eero taking $100 off its triple set of routers and $50 off its two-pack system in February. The Home Depot is also running a pretty significant sale on pairs of Luma on its website, slashing the price from $250 (apparently The Home Depot was already selling it for $49 less than Luma itself) down to $179, bringing it into perfect price parity with a Google Wifi two-pack. The offer is available exclusively online and ends today, so if you've been holding off buying a Luma, now is probably the time to go ahead and buy one.

[Continuously updated] April Fools' Roundup: All the jokes from around the web Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/01 7:24pm PDTApr 1, 2017 15 Plus 1 on G+ 71 Share on Facebook 86 Share on Twitter Total Shares172 Google News NVIDIA Samsung T-Mobile Videos Article Contents 1 Google Gnome 2 Mrs. Pac-Man in Google Maps 3 Google's Bubble Wrap Keyboard 4 Google Assistant 5 Google Wind 6 Netflix Live 7 T-Mobile ONEsie 8 Hulu Hu 9 OnePlus Dash drink 10 Lyft Mono 11 Honor BFF 12 Google Haptic Helpers 13 Amazon Petlexa 14 Contour by SlickWraps 15 Nvidia GTX G-Assist 16 Google's data center on Mars 17 LineageOS' mascot 18 Chromebook accessories 19 Exynos Yoga Processor 20 Carved screen protector 21 I'm Feeling Woof/I'm Feeling Meow 22 Waze maps for Mars 23 JerryRigEverything's NoPhone video 24 Google Translate for Heptapod B 25 Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s 26 MKBHD's Nokia 3310 review 27 Open GApps Femto April Fools Day is almost upon us, but some companies aren't waiting to share their pranks. Google always does a great job, from the Pokemon Google Maps overlay to a smart mailbox, but there are a few from other companies worth mentioning. Here's a rundown of all the hillarious (or strange) tech-related April Fools Day jokes from around the web. Google Gnome One of Google's product launches from last year was the Google Home, a $129 smart speaker with Google Assistant. Now the company is teasing the "Google Gnome," an outside version of the Home. You can ask it weather questions, let it control your lawnmower and other tools, and even dress it up in accessories. The Google Gnome has a page on the Google Store, but unfortunately you can't buy it. I really want a rain coat for my Google Home, though. Mrs. Pac-Man in Google Maps For April Fools' 2015, Google added Pac-Man into Google Maps and Ingress. This year, Mrs Pac-Man is invading Google Maps. For regions of the world already on April 1st, a new Mrs. Pac-Man button is visible on the mobile app. You then have to control Mrs. Pac-Man on real-life streets, and of course, outrun the Ghosts. Google's Bubble Wrap Keyboard (English subtitles are available) Google Japan's prank is pretty funny - it's a bubble wrap keyboard. The idea is to pop bubbles on a bubble wrap sheet to form words, then feed the sheet through a reader to send the message. Some of the bubble wrap sheets are even scented. Google Assistant Google has plenty of Easter Eggs in Google Assistant, and as you might expect, there's one for April Fools' Day too. When asked, Assistant will offer advice on how not to get pranked, such as "If something seems too good to be true today, it probably is." Google Wind Google's Netherlands division has its own April Fools' Day gag, named 'Google Wind.' The idea is to use machine learning to control the weather, using Holland's famous windmills. I'll admit, this one is pretty great. Netflix Live Will Arnet has been in plenty of Netflix original content, from BoJack Horseman to A Series of Unfortunate Events. For April Fools' Day, Netflix is proud to share 'Netflix Live', which is nearly an hour of Arnett commentating ordinary events like toasting bread and completing a crossword puzzle. It's actually funnier than it sounds. You can watch the full thing here (a Netflix subscription is required). T-Mobile ONEsie T-Mobile's prank is a onesie, with "full-body coverage" and a built-in 4G LTE hotspot. You can actually buy it for $40, but the real one doesn't have any tech inside it. Hulu Hu With the claim that the human attention span has "dropped to eight seconds," Hulu has released 'Hu.' It's just a library of short clips from existing Hulu content, and you actually need an account to see them. This is probably the lamest April Fools' Day gag in the list - better luck next year, guys. OnePlus Dash drink OnePlus is really proud of its Dash Charge feature, even to the point of enlisting celebrities to talk about it. For April Fools', the company made real Dash Charge energy drinks. You can find our review of the drink here. Lyft Mono For April Fools' Day, Lyft has announced the 'Lyft Mono.' It's a wearable glove, vaguely resembling a Nintendo Power Glove. This gag is actually real, and once you put it on and get the app, sticking out your thumb will hail a Lyft cab. You can sign up to for a chance to get one here. Honor BFF We all need some positive reinforcement every now and then, right? Honor thinks so, and created the Honor BFF. This imaginary phone uses machine learning to periodically give you compliments and motivation. Hopefully it ships with Android 7.1 Nougat. Google Haptic Helpers This is probably my favorite gag so far. In order to create a more realistic virtual reality experience, you can schedule a "haptic helper" to come to your house and help create a more realistic environment. Just watch the video, it's hilarious. Amazon Petlexa Alexa is cool and all, but your furry friends need one too. As the name implies, Petlexa is Alexa for your pets. Contour by SlickWraps Putting a skin on your phone or tablet is too much work. For April Fool's Day, Slickwraps is teasing the 'Countour' - a machine that sprays on device skins. Frankly, I'm not sure if this is actually real or not, but there is a page for it on SlickWrap's store. Nvidia GTX G-Assist How many times have you been playing an online game, only to be interrupted by someone in real life? NVIDIA has made the 'G Assist,' a flash drive that can take over for you if you're busy. It can also help you beat boss battles, and provides periodic reminders to consume energy drinks. More information and a video can be found here. Google's data center on Mars If you have important data, you need a backup. That's why Google announced its first interplanetary data center, named "Ziggy Stardust," on the Google Cloud Platform Blog today. Located in the Gale Crater on Mars, it will store a cache of data from Earth to prevent irrecoverable loss when a planetary disaster strikes. Google hopes to finish the data center by 2018. LineageOS' mascot CyanogenMod's mascot, Cid, was one of the most recognizable icons in the Android community. As the spiritual successor to CyanogenMod, LineageOS has created its own mascot - 'Ink'. The project also announced 'Br0zip,' an artificial intelligence that can port LineageOS to any device in no time at all. Chromebook accessories Even though most Chromebooks can now run Android apps, you still can't use your Chromebook like an Android phone/tablet for all use cases. Until now, that is. Google has announced a Chromebook Groupie Stick (seen above), a Chromebook Cardboard headset, and a Chromebook armband. See the company's blog post for more info. Exynos Yoga Processor Remember when curved phones were a thing? Maybe we'll see more in the coming months, because Samsung has just unveiled the Exynos Yoga Processor - the first flexible mobile SoC. Anyone up for a Galaxy Flex? Carved screen protector Carved is a small Indiana-based phone case company, but now they are working on a wooden screen protector. Why hasn't this been done before? I'll take ten. I'm Feeling Woof/I'm Feeling Meow By force-touching the Google app icon in iOS, you can select "I'm Feeling Woof" or "I'm Feeling Meow." These give your pets access to the stuff they care about - from dog food to balls of yarn. More info can be found on Google's blog post. Waze maps for Mars According to the company's blog, Waze is has begun to map the surface of Mars. Certain members of the Waze community will also be sent to the Red Planet to more accurately map the surface. JerryRigEverything's NoPhone video If you haven't heard about it, the NoPhone is a solid piece of plastic designed to simulate the feeling of a phone in your pocket. I'm not really sure if anyone uses it, but JerryRigEverything is happy to break it just as much as any other phone. Google Translate for Heptapod B Using machine learning, Google Translate can now decrypt messages written in Heptapod B - the language from the film Arrival. On an unrelated note, it looks like someone from Google is still rocking a Nexus 10. See Google's blog post for more info. Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s ASUS has an April Fools gag too - the Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s Veritas Blue Limited Special Edition. I would probably buy this phone. MKBHD's Nokia 3310 review You may have heard about the updated Nokia 3310, but it turns out the original is an amazing smartphone. Okay, maybe not, but the video is pretty funny. Open GApps Femto Do you need to flash the latest Gapps package on your device, but you don't have a stable network connection? Not to worry, the Open GApps Femto package is here to help. It uses the United States HAARP service (which is not real, but just pretend) to download the latest GApps package. You can find more info at the GApps blog.   That concludes our coverage of April Fools' Day in the tech world. Let us know in the comments below which gag you liked the most!

Yeah they actuqally had me going until I compared a whois of kodi.tv vs kickasstorrents.com, a site that actually was seized. The whois data would show that it is not official. Derik Taylor So this is one I find interesting. Could it technically be a criminal offense to falsify a domain seizure? How would that work? mondeca I hope every year that Google will announce something real and awesome on April Fools' Day, like they did with Gmail. Once again, I am disappointed.

Peterson Silva "Frankly, I'm not sure if this is actually real or not" Well then THAT ought to be the best one! Trooper311 Gimme dat gnome yo. abqnm The Google Haptic Helpers was OK, until they applied the "I Voted!" sticker to the guy's shirt. I was laughing and crying at the same time. Corbin Davenport Yep, that had me laughing too. AdrianFDiratama . How about JG I'd actually like to see Google produce the Google Gnome.... All they'd need to do is add a battery (and Qi charging) to a Google Home and stick it in a new Gnome shell... Make sure its IP68 and maybe even MIL-STD-810G certified. It'd be a fun little gadget to put on the picnic table of your next summer back yard get together. Pump out some tunes, order pizza & Ubers for everyone to go home in, etc... Or take out when you work in the garden & don't want to get your phone dirty... Maybe even produce one with an LTE radio (and GPS). Then you could take it out of WiFi range camping.

The updated smartwatch operating system was originally expected to release at the end of 2016 but was delayed until this year. Following the official launch last month, Google has now admitted the wider rollout for older Android Wear devices is being pushed back. The reason for the delay is an undisclosed bug that was discovered during the final testing phase of Android 2.0. No specifics have been released, but it must have been quite serious if the firm decided to delay the release. When Google officially launched Android 2.0 on February 8, it announced that the first watches to come with the OS would be LG’s Watch Style and Watch Sport, both of which were designed in collaboration with Google. At the time, the company said the 2.0 update would be rolling out to older devices “in the coming weeks.” In addition to announcing the delay, Google said it was now rolling out Android 2.0 to three newer smartwatches: The Fossil Q Founder, Casio Smart Outdoor Watch WSD-F10, and Tag Heuer Connected. It should arrive on these devices by April 4 at the latest. "For other devices, the update is currently being delayed due to a bug found in final testing. We will push the update to the remaining devices as soon as the issue is resolved," a spokesperson said in a statement. 9to5Google has a full list of watches that will eventually get the Android Wear 2.0 update, which includes the ZenWatch and Moto 360.

As we sift through our inbox while drinking that morning cup of coffee we’re met with excitement, disbelief, and even dread as we try to discern what’s real and what’s not. It’s a day that has us questioning everything. And since April 1 falls on a Saturday this year, we now have an extra day of increased skepticism to look forward to. “This event was off the charts” Gary Vaynerchuk was so impressed with TNW Conference 2016 he paused mid-talk to applaud us. FIND OUT WHY These are the companies and products that make us hate this time of year (in no particular order). Google Google Netherlands unveiled Google Wind, launching April 1. According to the promo video, the company can now control the weather using Dutch windmills in Holland. As the video points out, The Netherlands is one of the best countries to live in. There’s only one downside: it rains 145 days a year. Google Wind could be the answer. “At Google, we’ve solved [the rain problem] by repurposing some of Holland’s old windmills, using them not to capture wind, but to generate it.” Google has offered up some of the best gags on April 1 due to the innovative nature of the company and the believability of its April Fools’ jokes. This year, however, it seems the company just said fuck it, although with typical hilarious results. Google wasn’t done there, though. We also saw the Google Maps app running Ms. Pac Man, which we covered earlier. Driver Finder by CarGurus CarGurus has traditionally given potential buyers the chance to chat to sellers to find out more about the car, but today, the company wants to flip the script. DriverFinder, as the feature’s called is a “groundbreaking” technology that lets cars interview their potential owners. As the CarGurus points out “In this age of self-driving cars and advanced AI, cars are essentially people too. This makes it critical to take their feelings into consideration during the car shopping process.” You can try it here: DriverFinder Lyft Mono Mono is a cutesy wearable that resembles the shape of a hand when hitchhiking. The futuristic device allows you to keep the phone in your pocket while hailing a ride from Lyft. ”With Mono, we want to make the entire ridesharing process as seamless as possible, whether you’re a bellman who can’t whistle or a mom with her hands full; a nudist who needs a ride or a millennial who just can’t even. Forget about screens, taps, and notifications. Just lift, request, and ride.” This one is actually quite odd for two reasons: one, it’s just so ridiculous to think this could be more useful than your phone in hailing a ride, and two, Lyft actually created it! Like, for realsies. Lexus LC: Lane Valet Lexus this year introduced a (fake) feature for the 2018 LC that I’d actually love to see. When cruising along in the faster left lanes, there’s nothing more frustrating than a slow-moving driver who won’t get over and allow you to pass. Lexus fixed the problem by allowing its car to communicate with others. Lane Valet is “a semi-autonomous technology technology that can connect to left lane vehicles obstructing the flow of traffic and do the driver the courtesy of moving their vehicle for them.” And I want it. Tinder’s ‘Live Date’ Curious to see how this one plays out, but according to a Facebook promo video, Tinder is hosting a ‘Live’ date today at 12pm PST/3pm EST. Details aren’t available yet, but we’ll tune in and update this once it happens. Update: Lame. 😞 Duolingo emoji course Duolingo today unveiled a new (and 100-percent fake) course to help parents and grandparents understand the language of choice for millennials: emoji. According to the website: Learn Emoji in just 🖐 minutes a day with our game-like lessons. Whether you’re a beginner starting with the basics (👋, mom!) or looking to practice your 📖 , ✍️, and 🗣 , Duolingo is scientifically proven to work. Netflix Live This one is actually semi-hilarious. Netflix today introduced a feature where Will Arnett watches some of the most mundane videos on the internet while providing commentary. First I got to see Arnett’s hilarious take monologue about office lighting while watching a live video of a printer in a dimly-lit office. “Nobody looks good in this lighting. Well, maybe Ashton Kutcher.” Now, he’s providing valuable analysis of a burrito being microwaved — “Minute left, we’re really rounding third on this one.” I could watch this all day. DoorDash ‘M.O.M’ Today DoorDash announced a new feature that allows kids to order their own food. Called Meal Override Mode — or just M.O.M. — the app handles dinner delivery so mom and dad can continue being absentee parents. According to the announcement, there are several kid-friendly additions to the app that should make parents smile: Do your homework: “Before they can submit their order, kids will have to solve the summation problem created by their order. More advanced students can even delve into algebra by calculating the correct tip and tax amount as percentages.” Eat your veggies: “With M.O.M. activated, your child won’t be able to finish their order until there’s a healthy handful of vegetables in their cart.” Finish your chores: “Since M.O.M. always knows best, it’ll calculate the best character-building opportunities that span the length of your delivery times. Watch your ladd or lass light up as they learn the joys of walking the dog, practicing piano, setting the table, and more!” Trulia The best April Fools’ Day pranks are believable, almost subtle cons that make you wonder if this could actually be true. Trulia missed the memo and today announced rental listings for pets. “With Trulia’s new listings, pets get the whole pawspective. Using Trulia, Molly the Mastif can search for the perfect doghouse to raise her new litter, and Smokey the Siamese can easily stalk his next urban rental retreat, complete with floor-to-ceiling bay windows for the best bird-watching a cat could ask for.” Shoot me. Hinge ‘Parental Controls’ Hinge, if you’re unaware, is a dating app. Today, the company introduced Hinge Parental Controls, “a dashboard in your Hinge account for your mom and dad to access.” Once inside, mom and dad can set their preferences for your potential matches. They’ll choose occupation (as long as its a doctor, surgeon, or other), timeframe for children (yesterday, ASAP, 9 months), distance from mom and dad (same house, around the corner, same town), and select which holidays their available for visits. The scary part is, I think I know people that would actually use this. Moshi ‘USB-L’ According to the launch video, Moshi has tapped into the speed of light in launching its new USB connection, USB-L — “L” is for the speed of light, get it? Moshi — which makes some of the best peripherals and accessories on the market — has struck gold by creating a USB adapter that can charge your device in an instant, all while providing Gigabit internet. The video is a bit over the top, so it removes any notion of tricking people into believing this is actually a thing, but that doesn’t stop me from wishing it were. Man Crates ‘Man Freight’ Man Crates, a gift box delivery company, realizes the best way to give a gift isn’t through the mail, but in person. As such, the company today announced Man Freight, a feature that — assuming you can find the way to its warehouse — ships you along with the gift so you can hand deliver it. “We’ve designed 16 square feet of luxurious space to help the most medium-sized adult feel at home on the road. When you purchase a gift from Man Crates, select Man Freight as your delivery option. Then find your way to our warehouse where we’ll board you up and ship you out. The ride will be anything but boring thanks to our complimentary snacks, air holes and WiFi.” 2-3 days later, the recipient gets to pry open the crate containing you, and their gift. Samuel Adams launches BREWBR BREWBR, from one of America’s favorite beer makers, today launched a transportation service that’s basically the Uber for drunks, a craft beer ride-sharing service that will not only get you to your destination, but ensure you’re well lubricated by the time you get there. You can download the app and give it a spin here. TomTom Sports Wearables and Trump’s Climbing Wall TomTom, one of the most popular GPS manufacturers in the world, is having a little fun at the expense of Trump’s border wall. The relatively new division of wearables, TomTom Sports, encourages us to get of our ass, and get active. And what better way to do it than putting in work on Trump’s border wall? 8/10, would climb. Tripping.com Exclusive White House Vacation Rentals TomTom wasn’t the only company to poke some fun at Donald Trump this April Fools’ day. Tripping.com, a vacation rental aggregator, noticed that Trump was spending a fair amount of time away from The White House and managed to negotiate a pretty sweet exclusive agreement to secure the unused space. “With the President choosing to spend the majority of his weekends at either Mar-a-Lago or one of his other phenomenal, world-class properties, we saw an opportunity to offset some of the costs of his travels while also helping to contribute to balancing the country’s budget by renting out the White House,” said a White House spokesperson. Double-win. Stay at the White House, and help add to the countries coffers while doing it. That’s just patriotic. Lovehoney’s ‘Moan Droan’ Lovehoney, an online peddler of sex toys and fine adult products, just solved the problem you didn’t know you had. When the mood strikes, and you can’t bear the thought of cooling the fire long enough to wait for traditional delivery — or make a visit to the adult store in the shady part of town, shudder — Lovehoney wants to keep the party going with its newly-announced drone delivery program, Moan Droan. Now, you can shop from the comfort of your own home while knowing that, within minutes, the right tool for the job will be on its way to your door. PornHub shares your videos on social PornHub wins the award for cruelest April Fools’ prank with this gem. Users that click a video, for uh, educational purposes, are met with a pop up that thanks them for sharing their dirty, dirty porn viewing habits on social media. That’s cold, PornHub. Snapchat trolls Instagram Snapchat just had a large IPO, which is a pro. On the con side, it’s had to watch as Facebook-owned properties (Facebook proper, Snapchat and Whatsapp) picked apart its platform and stole the best features. On April Fools’ Day, though, Snapchat struck back.

Google and Amazon joined a list of potential buyers eyeing Toshiba's lucrative memory chip business as the Japanese conglomerate seeks bidders to cover huge losses, a newspaper said today. Toshiba has reportedly completed the first round of bidding for its prized memory chip business, seen as key for the cash-strapped company to turn itself around. Some 10 foreign companies and funds, including Google and Amazon, tendered bids, the mass-circulation Yomiuri Shimbun said, quoting unnamed sources. The two US tech giants are expected to use Toshiba's memory chips for their cloud services, the daily said. Taiwan's Hon Hai, which acquired Japanese electronics maker Sharp last year, has apparently bid more than 2 trillion yen (USD 18 billion), the daily said. Immediate confirmation of the report was not available. Toshiba shares jumped more than five percent on Friday after local media reported that bidders included Apple, US private-equity firm Silver Lake Partners and American chipmaker Broadcom. Toshiba is expected to negotiate with individual candidates this month. Local media said any foreign buyer would need to pass a Japanese government review, given concerns about security around systems already using Toshiba's memory chips. Toshiba is the world's number two supplier of memory chips for smartphones and computers, behind South Korea's Samsung, and the business accounted for about a quarter of its 5.67 trillion yen in revenue last fiscal year. The news report came after angry investors lambasted Toshiba executives at a shareholders meeting over its warning that annual losses could balloon to more than USD 9.0 billion.The red ink is largely tied to huge cost overruns and construction delays at its US nuclear power unit Westinghouse Electric, which filed for bankruptcy protection late March. tags #Amazon #Business #Google #Hon Hai #memory chip business #Samsung #Sharp #Silver Lake Partners Broadcom #Toshiba #Westinghouse Electric #World News #Yomiuri Shimbun Related news Business VE Commercial Vehicles sales up 8.5% in March Apr 01, 2017 06:57 PM Business Honda Cars India sales up 8.7% at 18,950 units in March Apr 01, 2017 06:54 PM Business Tata Steel Q4 production up 24% at 3 MT Apr 01, 2017 06:48 PM Business Hyundai sales up 8% at 55,614 units in March Apr 01, 2017 06:47 PM Business Tata Motors sales up 8% at 57,145 units in March Apr 01, 2017 06:45 PM Business EXCLUSIVE: Complaints prompt Intas to recall batch of biosimilar Razumab in India Apr 01, 2017 06:13 PM Business Here's what Triumph India is planning for the future Apr 01, 2017 05:50 PM Business Madhya Pradesh govt vows to reform Romeos, bring bill to hang rapists Apr 01, 2017 05:22 PM Business Tapan Singhel re-appointed Bajaj Allianz General CEO for five years Apr 01, 2017 05:06 PM News Most Popular Top News Maybe it's time for hostile takeovers; govt must back honest risks: Uday Kotak D-Mart bumper listing: Should you buy, book profits or hold shares?

Once again, people on Google Maps have been gven the option of playing the classic arcade game Pacman. Opening Google Maps automatically launches the arcade classic, and a dedicated Pac-Man button sits above the ‘My Location’ icon. Google Maps Ms Pac-Man is available on both Android and iOS, though some users are reporting slight differences between the two versions. While Android users are being transported to a random area of the world, some iPhone users claim to have the ability to choose a specific location, says a report in UK's The Independent. You can also play the game on the desktop version of Google Maps. "Starting now until April 4, you can chomp fruit, avoid ghosts, and collect PAC-Dots along city streets in Google Maps worldwide," wrote Ms Pac-Maps product manager David Hendon in a blog post. This isn't the first time Google has transformed Maps into Ms Pac-Man, having pulled the same April Fools' Day stunt back in 2015.

IE Home Nation World Opinion Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Gadgets Review Photos Videos Mobile & Tabs Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Tech News Google’s April Fool’s Day prank is a new smart speaker called Gnome Google’s April Fool’s Day prank is a new smart speaker called Gnome Google Gnome, which can be launched by saying 'OK Gnome', can apparently 'set alarm to smell roses'. By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Updated: April 1, 2017 11:39 am Google Gnome, which can be launched by saying ‘OK Gnome’, can apparently ‘set alarm to smell roses’. Google has revealed its April Fool’s Day prank -a Gnome speaker for outdoor – with the product listed on Google’s online store. Of course, users can’t buy the Gnome speaker given its a part of Google’s April Fool’s Day prank and the search giant clearly states the same at the bottom of the product listing page. “Google Gnomes are real, but only in our hearts — for now. Happy April Fools’!” reads Google Gnome’s product page. Google also posted a YouTube video showcasing the capabilities of its outdoor smart speaker. The Gnome speaker, being used by a family of three in their yard, reminds the woman it only takes outdoor requests when she asks it to add milk to her shopping list. Further, the Gnome speaker says, “Really we’re all compost if you think about it. Pretty much everything is made up of organic matter and will return to organic matter,” while the boy and his father in the video stand in their yard looking pleased. Google Gnome, which can be launched by saying ‘OK Gnome’, can apparently ‘set alarm to smell roses’ (really Google?), tell the wind speed, take control of yard tools such as pressure washer, leaf blower, tiller and more. Some other ‘imagination gone wild’ and crazy things that users can do with Gnome is accessorise the device with gear to protect against the elements, keep it cozy in a cover from the hiver collection, get Gnome a buddy and make it sit on a specially made camp chair. Now as much as we’d like Google’s Gnome to be true and be able to do all these wonderful things, remember that it isn’t. At the end of the day, it is Google’s another April Fool’s Day prank, and a pretty good one if we look at all the details.

Here's a rundown of all the hillarious (or strange) tech-related April Fools Day jokes from around the web. Google Gnome One of Google's product launches from last year was the Google Home, a $129 smart speaker with Google Assistant. Now the company is teasing the "Google Gnome," an outside version of the Home. You can ask it weather questions, let it control your lawnmower and other tools, and even dress it up in accessories. The Google Gnome has a page on the Google Store, but unfortunately you can't buy it. I really want a rain coat for my Google Home, though. Mrs. Pac-Man in Google Maps For April Fools' 2015, Google added Pac-Man into Google Maps and Ingress. This year, Mrs Pac-Man is invading Google Maps. For regions of the world already on April 1st, a new Mrs. Pac-Man button is visible on the mobile app. You then have to control Mrs. Pac-Man on real-life streets, and of course, outrun the Ghosts. Google's Bubble Wrap Keyboard (English subtitles are available) Google Japan's prank is pretty funny - it's a bubble wrap keyboard. The idea is to pop bubbles on a bubble wrap sheet to form words, then feed the sheet through a reader to send the message. Some of the bubble wrap sheets are even scented. Google Assistant Google has plenty of Easter Eggs in Google Assistant, and as you might expect, there's one for April Fools' Day too. When asked, Assistant will offer advice on how not to get pranked, such as "If something seems too good to be true today, it probably is." Google Wind Google's Netherlands division has its own April Fools' Day gag, named 'Google Wind.' The idea is to use machine learning to control the weather, using Holland's famous windmills. I'll admit, this one is pretty great. Netflix Live Will Arnet has been in plenty of Netflix original content, from BoJack Horseman to A Series of Unfortunate Events. For April Fools' Day, Netflix is proud to share 'Netflix Live', which is nearly an hour of Arnett commentating ordinary events like toasting bread and completing a crossword puzzle. It's actually funnier than it sounds. You can watch the full thing here (a Netflix subscription is required). T-Mobile ONEsie T-Mobile's prank is a onesie, with "full-body coverage" and a built-in 4G LTE hotspot. You can actually buy it for $40, but the real one doesn't have any tech inside it. Hulu Hu With the claim that the human attention span has "dropped to eight seconds," Hulu has released 'Hu.' It's just a library of short clips from existing Hulu content, and you actually need an account to see them. This is probably the lamest April Fools' Day gag in the list - better luck next year, guys. OnePlus Dash drink OnePlus is really proud of its Dash Charge feature, even to the point of enlisting celebrities to talk about it. For April Fools', the company made real Dash Charge energy drinks. You can find our review of the drink here. Lyft Mono For April Fools' Day, Lyft has announced the 'Lyft Mono.' It's a wearable glove, vaguely resembling a Nintendo Power Glove. This gag is actually real, and once you put it on and get the app, sticking out your thumb will hail a Lyft cab. You can sign up to for a chance to get one here. Honor BFF We all need some positive reinforcement every now and then, right? Honor thinks so, and created the Honor BFF. This imaginary phone uses machine learning to periodically give you compliments and motivation. Hopefully it ships with Android 7.1 Nougat. Google Haptic Helpers This is probably my favorite gag so far. In order to create a more realistic virtual reality experience, you can schedule a "haptic helper" to come to your house and help create a more realistic environment. Just watch the video, it's hilarious. Amazon Petlexa Alexa is cool and all, but your furry friends need one too. As the name implies, Petlexa is Alexa for your pets. Contour by SlickWraps Putting a skin on your phone or tablet is too much work. For April Fool's Day, Slickwraps is teasing the 'Countour' - a machine that sprays on device skins. Frankly, I'm not sure if this is actually real or not, but there is a page for it on SlickWrap's store. Nvidia GTX G-Assist How many times have you been playing an online game, only to be interrupted by someone in real life? NVIDIA has made the 'G Assist,' a flash drive that can take over for you if you're busy. It can also help you beat boss battles, and provides periodic reminders to consume energy drinks. More information and a video can be found here. Google's data center on Mars If you have important data, you need a backup. That's why Google announced its first interplanetary data center, named "Ziggy Stardust," on the Google Cloud Platform Blog today. Located in the Gale Crater on Mars, it will store a cache of data from Earth to prevent irrecoverable loss when a planetary disaster strikes. Google hopes to finish the data center by 2018. LineageOS' mascot CyanogenMod's mascot, Cid, was one of the most recognizable icons in the Android community. As the spiritual successor to CyanogenMod, LineageOS has created its own mascot - 'Ink'. The project also announced 'Br0zip,' an artificial intelligence that can port LineageOS to any device in no time at all. Chromebook accessories Even though most Chromebooks can now run Android apps, you still can't use your Chromebook like an Android phone/tablet for all use cases. Until now, that is. Google has announced a Chromebook Groupie Stick (seen above), a Chromebook Cardboard headset, and a Chromebook armband. See the company's blog post for more info. Exynos Yoga Processor Remember when curved phones were a thing? Maybe we'll see more in the coming months, because Samsung has just unveiled the Exynos Yoga Processor - the first flexible mobile SoC. Anyone up for a Galaxy Flex? Carved screen protector Carved is a small Indiana-based phone case company, but now they are working on a wooden screen protector. Why hasn't this been done before? I'll take ten. I'm Feeling Woof/I'm Feeling Meow By force-touching the Google app icon in iOS, you can select "I'm Feeling Woof" or "I'm Feeling Meow." These give your pets access to the stuff they care about - from dog food to balls of yarn. More info can be found on Google's blog post. Waze maps for Mars According to the company's blog, Waze is has begun to map the surface of Mars. Certain members of the Waze community will also be sent to the Red Planet to more accurately map the surface. JerryRigEverything's NoPhone video If you haven't heard about it, the NoPhone is a solid piece of plastic designed to simulate the feeling of a phone in your pocket. I'm not really sure if anyone uses it, but JerryRigEverything is happy to break it just as much as any other phone. Google Translate for Heptapod B Using machine learning, Google Translate can now decrypt messages written in Heptapod B - the language from the film Arrival. On an unrelated note, it looks like someone from Google is still rocking a Nexus 10. See Google's blog post for more info. Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s ASUS has an April Fools gag too - the Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s Veritas Blue Limited Special Edition. I would probably buy this phone. MKBHD's Nokia 3310 review You may have heard about the updated Nokia 3310, but it turns out the original is an amazing smartphone. Okay, maybe not, but the video is pretty funny. Open GApps Femto Do you need to flash the latest Gapps package on your device, but you don't have a stable network connection? Not to worry, the Open GApps Femto package is here to help. It uses the United States HAARP service (which is not real, but just pretend) to download the latest GApps package. You can find more info at the GApps blog.   That concludes our coverage of April Fools' Day in the tech world. Let us know in the comments below which gag you liked the most!

Greg Abbott https://kodi.tv/ Sergio Carmona Scariest one... seriously... Artem Russakovskii Not even a 503 or something? Just a 200? Ballsy re: SEO. SickoPsycho oops- beat me to it. Yeah they actuqally had me going until I compared a whois of kodi.tv vs kickasstorrents.com, a site that actually was seized. The whois data would show that it is not official. Derik Taylor So this is one I find interesting. Could it technically be a criminal offense to falsify a domain seizure? How would that work? mondeca I hope every year that Google will announce something real and awesome on April Fools' Day, like they did with Gmail. Once again, I am disappointed. JG It isn't technically April Fools Day yet... Least not in the US... Jordan Introducing the Boeing Dreambird 1417 https://www.facebook.com/virginatlantic/videos/10155188765647679/ andyy Corbin, the last one (SlickWraps) isn't embedded properly Artem Russakovskii Thanks, fixed it. BatJake Will Arnett sounds like Michael Keaton. Corbin Davenport And they both have played Batman. Peterson Silva "Frankly, I'm not sure if this is actually real or not" Well then THAT ought to be the best one! Trooper311 Gimme dat gnome yo. abqnm The Google Haptic Helpers was OK, until they applied the "I Voted!" sticker to the guy's shirt. I was laughing and crying at the same time. Corbin Davenport Yep, that had me laughing too. AdrianFDiratama . How about JG I'd actually like to see Google produce the Google Gnome.... All they'd need to do is add a battery (and Qi charging) to a Google Home and stick it in a new Gnome shell... Make sure its IP68 and maybe even MIL-STD-810G certified. It'd be a fun little gadget to put on the picnic table of your next summer back yard get together. Pump out some tunes, order pizza & Ubers for everyone to go home in, etc... Or take out when you work in the garden & don't want to get your phone dirty... Maybe even produce one with an LTE radio (and GPS). Then you could take it out of WiFi range camping. Wake up and find him chilling next to your tent in his little chair "Hey Google, how's today's weather? When does the rafting place open? How far away from the camp site is it?" cdotlawrence Maybe like a more customizable (from a looks standpoint), durable, & usable-on-go version of Home? Google Home Pro/Ultra? Interesting idea, but not sure why you wouldn't do most of the things it would do on your phone. Some specific use cases like you mentioned but beyond those, idk. Guess it'd be a highly functional, portable, durable and customizable speaker? Suicide_Note Ms. Pac-Man in Maps is live for me here in the US, even though it isn't April 1st yet. Daishi No Clarity Speaker??? Artem Russakovskii Why would that be in this post? Urmil Shroff What if we actually get the Mars data center many years from now? Eumelanin Knight I love this day. I just wish everyone kept up the pranks for the entire month like I do. Oddly enough.. I usually have less friends in May than I started with in April. How curious. Not sure why I brought that up. Totally unrelated. Josh Ewing VortexHornady Bullet-Cam https://youtu.be/hoGRlS53U_k Courtney King Google is so adorkable. JD It used to be funny when Google did April fools stunts but now I just get upset because I think of all the broken crap they need to fix but instead they're busy with April fools trash.

The Ordinary People star raged against ordinary fans getting priced out by the vultures on the One Show on Thursday night. But the Record can reveal that more than 800 tickets for his show at the SSE Hydro were already on sale on controversial sites such as Viagogo, Get Me In!, Seatwave and Stubhub – despite the official Ticketmaster sale only starting on Friday morning. Confused fans searching the internet for official tickets were further bamboozled by the secondary sales sites appearing higher up on Google searches than Ticketmaster. Read More Campaigners hail breakthrough in fight against ticket touts as Lords vote to tighten up rules for sellers US singer John Legend is set to perform at the SSE Hydro (Photo: PA) Even searching for “John Legend Ticketmaster” on Google throws up Viagogo and Ticketmaster’s own secondary site GetMeIn! higher in the listing. On the One Show, which ran a feature on the current crackdown against ticket touts in Parliament, US smoothie Legend slammed those using “botnet” software to harvest tickets: “We are getting feedback from our fans, who are asking why we are charging so much for tickets but we’re not charging £1000 per ticket. “It’s the resale sites that are charging this exorbitant amount and we want out fans to pay a fair market price for our show. “We don’t want these bots coming in and snatching up all the tickets and making them more scarce and selling them to the highest bidder and capturing the value and making it hard for people with regular incomes to come and see the show. Read More Daily Record campaign against ticket touts reaches Parliament but Viagogo don't show up to answer claims Touts are targeting the gig at the SSE Hydro (Photo: SNS Group) “It’s hard because you try all these codes and electronic ways to stop them but it’s still a challenge.” MP John Nicolson, a prominent voice at the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee’s inquiry into ticket abuse, slammed Google for putting profits before the interests of fans. He said: “It’s deeply disappointing that Google are still allowing invalid tickets sold through Viagogo to top John Legend online searches. “This despite the fact that witnesses at our recent Commons Select Committee hearings have told Google that fans could be turned away. “Viagogo don’t care. It looks increasingly as if Google don’t care either.” A spokesman for campaign group The FanFair Alliance slammed the touts who appear to be speculatively selling tickets before harvesting as many briefs as they can when the official sales start. Read More Music fans given 10-step guide on how to tackle ticket touts He said: “Thanks to the Record’s investigations, we are now gaining a much clearer picture of the type of operators who are bulk-selling tickets on the resale platforms. In most instances, the details raise more questions than answers. “These same operators must, presumably, also be managing to bulk-buy tickets at face value, before shifting them on in such large volumes and at such hike-up prices. “These so-called marketplaces are supposed to be trusted and transparent. Evidence would suggest they are anything but.” Read More Top news stories today Death threats for Harry Clarke daughter Neil Lennon's press conference rant Mum's heartbreak after helicopter crash Dealer stashed £100k of heroin in bin Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Daily Newsletter Follow @Daily_Record Subscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribe More On John Legend Ticket touts The Hydro News all Most Read Most Recent Weird NewsGirls on train take Friday night selfie – are photobombed by a famous face Everyone really misses you PrisonsDaniel crime clan con loses jail henchmen after prison bosses transfer Estonian killers Convicted heroin dealer Zander Sutherland recruited the thugs to provide muscle after he was targeted by rival prisoners.

As pranksters begin to unleash their best jokes around the world for the annual day of high jinks, Google didn't want to be left out of the fun.  The tech giant revealed a new feature on its Maps mobile app and for computers that makes getting lost when following directions that much easier. To celebrate April 1, people can now play the beloved Ms Pac-Man game while walking through the streets or just for fun.  Google released Ms Pac-Man for users to play while using its Maps feature for April Fools' Day on Saturday. Players can play the arcade game on their mobile phones or computers. The company first tried out the original maze game of Pac-Man exactly two years ago on Maps and it was wildly popular. Google announced the game on Facebook with the caption: 'She's a map-eater. And today, you can be one too.'   For playing the game on a mobile phone, click the pink button on the right.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next 'Z S L M N, there's silent letters at the end of that one':...

To play on the computer, the game icon will be on the screen's lower left corner and to get the yellow lady rolling, click the image. The screen of streets will morph and Ms Pac-Man appears along with the bug-eyed ghosts. Ms Pac-Man came out in 1981 after the popularity of Pac-Man, which debuted in 1980. The game is very similar to the original arcade game but has different music and the ghosts have different movement patterns The internet company also rolled out Google Gnome for April 1, the 'perfect' technology for homeowners who want to have a smart yard Ms Pac-Man came out in 1981 after the popularity of Pac-Man, which debuted in 1980.  The games are very similar but Ms Pac-Man has different music and the colorful ghosts have different movement patterns.  The arcade game wasn't the only trick Google had rolled up its sleeve. The internet company unveiled Google Gnome for April Fools' Day, the 'perfect' technology for homeowners who want to have a smart yard. The Gnome takes over where the Google Home can't, informing its owners of the weather while they are already outside, what type of plants they can eat and reminding humans that everyone will eventually be turned into compost.      Read more: Google Maps morphs into Ms. Pac-Man for April Fools¿ Day - The Verge Share or comment on this article e-mail 98 shares Most watched News videos Woman freaks out at restaurant and accuses couple of having sex 'Give me my keys you c***!': Biker attacks cyclist for stealing Shocking video of truck dangerously swerving on highway Trump exits oval office without signing executive orders on trade Villepinte: Horrific moment of huge explosion at carnival in France Live boa constrictor studded with quills after porcupine attack Jaw-dropping moment a great white shark catches a seal Nick Kyrgios yells at crowd jeering him during clash with Federer MASSIVE wave hurls sailboat and its four passengers into pier Shocking moment of 'accidental explosion' at popular Paris carnival Roger Federer's wife taunts Nick Kyrgios during Miami Open clash Most adorable kitties get treats when they ring their bells Heartbreak as remains of 'America's Maddie McCann' are...

It has launched an April Fools' Day version of Google Maps on Saturday (April 1) that allows users to play the classic arcade game of Ms Pac-Man on "real" streets. Launch the Google Maps app and you will see the pink Ms Pac-Man on the right side of the screen. Tap on it and you will be “transported” to a random location and must guide the yellow Pac-Man around the roads, eating up dots while avoiding colourful ghosts. Keep in mind: You only get five "lives" to outrun the ghosts. The last time Google turned its app into a game of Pac-Man for April Fools' Day was in 2015. In 2014, Google also introduced a version of Google Maps that allowed users to catch Pokemon on the app. mail print View all comments Tweet Recommended For You   More Stories For You The Most Singapore READ COMMENTED “Good progress” made in containing oil spillage after recent collisions “Bedding-in” period of several months to be expected for DTL2: Khaw ‘Zero tolerance’ for religious preaching that fans violence: Shanmugam ‘You have made Singapore very proud today’: PM Lee to Yip Pin Xiu ‘Wrecked dorm’ videos an isolated incident: SCDF ‘Smart’ law firms lauded for adopting tech solutions ‘More could have been done’ to inform commuters of test ‘Foul play’ in case of man who died after two punches in face Zika re-emerges: First thing new patient did was to inform pregnant neighbour Woodlands Checkpoint to be expanded Woman being investigated for lying to the police What you need to know as S'pore sees first active Zika cluster of 2017 What world needs is regulated globalisation: Hollande Wet and warm days ahead in April Water inefficient taps to be phased out from April 1 Inside Today World Serbian PM the runaway favourite to become president Third body found in aftermath of damaging Australian cyclone Australia academic, home after being barred from leaving China, vows to return Former Guatemalan dictator Rios Montt to face second genocide trial China says U.S. trade orders should respect international rules Business Ford recalls F-250 pickups that could roll while in park German prosecutors expect rulings in VW scandal this year: report Buying gold as an investment Apple, Amazon, Google join bidding for Toshiba chip unit: media Caterpillar shuts plant in Aurora, Illinois, that employs 800 Sports Home pays the price for poor finishing against Albirex Outside of football, Shahril looks to fashion success FAS set for revamp, if Team LKT wins It’s going to be very different, vows Lim Kia Tong The time has arrived to stand up and be counted Entertainment SAM to close for S$90m revamp Coldplay live up to the hype NAC ups arts funding, but some groups see cuts Finn Jones keeps mum on Iron Fist controversies Last chance to get into Sing!

The Galaxy S8 features a larger display than its predecessor, the Galaxy S7, and sports a voice assistant intended to rival Siri and Google Assistant. But there is no increase in battery capacity, providing the battery more breathing room. The Note 7 pushed the engineering envelope with its battery, which contributed to a series of spontaneous smart phone combustions. The Samsung Galaxy S8, right, and S8 Plus models have screens that curve around the edges and sport a voice assistant intended to rival Siri and Google Assistant. ASSOCIATED PRESS Enlarge The Galaxy S8 will come in two sizes, both bigger than last year’s models. Both models have screens that curve around the edges and get rid of the physical home button. The Note 7 recall cost Samsung at least $5.3 billion. Though many customers remain loyal, any further misstep could prove fatal for the brand. “We’re in the process of earning back that trust,” said Drew Blackard, a senior director of product marketing for Samsung. In the United States, Samsung started taking orders Thursday, with shipments scheduled for April 21. The standard-size S8 will cost about $750 and the larger S8 Plus about $850 — both about $100 more than comparable iPhones and rival Android phones. Samsung has blamed the Note 7 fires on multiple design and manufacturing defects in its batteries. Inspectors concluded that the initial batteries were too small for their capacity, and that their external pouch put pressure on the internal structure, leading to damage and overheating. Samsung recalled the phones and shipped replacements, but the newer batteries had welding defects and a lack of protective tape in some battery cells. Samsung recalled the replacements, too, and scrapped the phone. The company says phones will now go through multiple inspections, including X-rays and stress tests at extreme temperatures. The standard-size S8 phone has as much battery capacity as last year’s Galaxy S7, but the phone is 4 percent larger by volume. The larger S8 Plus model has 3 percent less capacity than the Galaxy S7 Edge and the same capacity as the Note 7, but the phone’s volume is larger by 12 percent and 6 percent, respectively. Both models have larger displays, meaning more drain on the battery. Samsung says software and processor efficiencies will let the new phones offer all-day battery life under normal use. The S8 phone’s display measures 5.8 inches diagonally, compared with 5.1 inches on the S7. The S8 Plus will be 6.2 inches, compared with S7 Edge’s 5.5 inches and the Note 7’s 5.7 inches. Both S8 models are taller than their predecessors, but widths are roughly the same to preserve one-handed use. Samsung claims its new voice assistant, Bixby, will do much more than rivals from Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. For one thing, Samsung says Bixby will be able to handle any smart phone task now managed by touch. Bixby also will offer information on books, wine and other products scanned with the phone’s camera. But there’s a major caveat: Bixby will work only with selected Samsung apps, including the photo gallery and messages. Not all touch commands will have voice counterparts right away. Other apps will be able to adopt Bixby, but Samsung has had a mixed track record in getting other companies to support its home-brewed functions. The front camera is getting a boost to 8 megapixels, from 5 megapixels, while the rear one stays at 12 megapixels. As with previous models, the S8 is water and dust resistant and features a memory card slot to supplement 64 gigabytes of built-in storage. The S8 will get an iris scanner to let people unlock the phone by looking at it; the feature was new in the ditched Note 7 phone. Samsung will include premium earbuds from AKG, a brand it acquired when it bought Harman International.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Accessories Our favorite smart lock just became the first ever to work with Alexa, Siri and Google Assistant Maren Estrada March 28th, 2017 at 12:00 PM Share Tweet There’s precious little question that the August Smart Lock is one of the best-looking intelligent door locking systems out there. It’s also one of the most feature-rich smart locks on the market, which is why we’ve repeatedly called it our favorite. Now, August has just issued a big update that adds yet another notch to its belt: the company’s lock can already be controlled with Amazon Alexa or with Apple’s Siri voice assistant, and now August has added support for Google Assistant. “As the first company to support all three major voice control platforms, we are giving our customers the ultimate flexibility to choose their preferred platform and device to integrate with the August Smart Lock,” August CEO Jason Johnson said. Initially, users will be able to lock August with Google Assistant, and they can check the status of their lock as well. In the future, the company also plans to add the ability to unlock an August lock with Google Assistant. Some notes from the press release: With the Google Assistant on Google Home, you can lock the door or check if the door is locked by saying, “Ok Google, ask August if my door is locked” or “Ok Google, talk to August to lock my door.” August is working with the Google team to add additional features such as unlocking that will be available later this year. Using the August Smart Lock with Google Assistant-enabled devices also requires the August Connect Wi-Fi bridge to connect the Bluetooth lock to Wi-Fi. And now, for the best news of all: the latest version of the August Smart Lock is currently discounted on Amazon. While Google Assistant support is being added to both the first and second-generation August Smart Locks, now is the perfect time to upgrade thanks to Amazon’s current $50 discount. Some notes from the product page: No more keys: Open your door and control who comes in – all from your August Home smartphone app Easy install: Attach to the inside of your current deadbolt in minutes. Your home’s exterior is unchanged. Hands-free access: Auto-unlock when you arrive home. Auto-locks after you’re inside. Feel secure: Share temporary virtual keys with guests & monitor access with 24/7 in-app activity feed. Remote access: Control your front door from anywhere from your app. Requires August Connect.

Welcome to Fast Forward, where we have conversations about living in the future. At SXSW this year, we talked with Sophie Kleber, Executive Director of Product and Innovation at the Huge Digital Agency. In the interview below, we discuss conversational interfaces, making smarter machines, and the bot revolution, among other things. Watch our chat or read the transcript below. Dan Costa: You gave a presentation about how we can make more emotional machines. What exactly does that mean, and why do we want to have more emotional machines? I was asked this question in my talk. When I proposed emotionally intelligent man-computer or machine-computer interactions, people were like, "We don't even have emotionally intelligent humans, so is it like the blind leading the blinder?" The thing is, we're currently at a super cusp between how we interact with machines. The time of what we call "the terminal world"—where we interact through terminals made smaller and smaller, but it's really just screens—that time is over. The interactions that we now have are becoming much more intuitive. Voice is the leading chart of it, but even the Internet of Things, in which computing power wraps your life and does things without you, even small adjustments without you consciously thinking about it, it's a very, very new world of interacting with machines. The intelligence that's starting to come up as well is fascinating. What we've noticed in research that we've done with people who have conversed with Alexa or Google is that the moment that machine starts talking, people assume relationships. It is not that these people say, "Oh, it's now just easier." They also assume that the machine has some sort of empathy towards them, some sort of support. The moment to think about what that means and what that personality is, is now. Then there's this other fear that's coming. It has been coming since 1995, when it was invented at MIT by Rosalyn Picard is the idea of effective computing. That means that machines are able to understand, interpret, and decode emotions and also potentially to react emotionally. There's these two sides to it, right? Yes. It's very, very important that we talk about it now because this the first step into mind reading. By 2021, this is expected to be a $36.4 billion dollar industry, so it's a massive industry of just detecting emotions. If you see what these machines can detect, there's basically three messages. There's facial recognition, voice, and biometrics. Facial is the most advanced because of these micro-movements that we have and micro-expressions that we have. If you see what can be done, it's a little bit like mind reading. It's a massive opportunity and a massive responsibility. Someone I talked to at MIT said it's like nuclear power. Now we have to see what we do with it. That's why we're talking about it now, because the moment is here. The intelligence is coming, the interaction models are changing, so we need to figure it out. People are ready for it, or assume it naturally, so we need to figure out what we do as industry and how we get into it. I think that phrase "terminal-based computing" is interesting. PCMag obviously covered the birth of the PC industry. We moved into the mobile space, but that was basically just a terminal that you could carry with you wherever you went. Now that we've got Siri and Google Now, those were okay interfaces, but with the rise of Alexa and Google Home you find people at home asking questions and getting into conversations. They literally presume that there's some kind of emotional response. They read into it. That's right. That's because as humans we were built to look for those types of responses. I have thought a lot about why Siri wasn't a success and Alexa is a success. I think there's two parts to it. The first one is that Siri was built as an alternative interface to an interface that was already there. Siri's on the phone, there's already an interface, why would I switch it to the voice, right? Because the voice interface was worse than the screen-based interface, it didn't kick off. Alexa doesn't have a screen interface. It's just a puck. It has only the voice interface. Plus Alexa's in the comfort of your home in which you have a much different understanding of privacy. It's yours. You are much more comfortable just talking out loud to a machine versus in public, [where] I'm not going to go ask Siri weird, embarrassing questions. I'm amazed at how many people do that, though. Complete voice dictation on a crowded train. Yeah, it's starting to become a little bit weird because these people forget that they're not in a private space. They don't understand what everyone else can hear. We see how that goes. The assumption of emotions was pretty big. In our user research, we found everything from wanting a basic assistant, just doing the chores and reminding you of stuff to this one guy said, "What if I could come home and I can unload onto my AI? I could just unload what happened in the day and the machine is like, 'Oh yeah, that's great.'" He wanted it to listen. Yes. He literally used the phrase "instead of paying the shrink." Then we asked people in an ideal world, what would you describe the relationship between the machine? They said anything from assistant, to friendly assistant, to friend, to best friend, even mom. Two people had named their AIs and one had named it after their mom and the other one had named it after their child. These are very, very personal relationships, so it's already there. I think when we think about what brands have to, and could do, the first thing we need to think about is what are we trying to achieve here? Are we trying to make Prozac in computer form? I think, luckily, the research in happiness has evolved enough to understand that that happiness is not the goal. People want a fulfilled life, to flourish. A way to flourish is not just being happy. It has to do with meaning. It has to do with meaningful relationships and accomplishment. This concept of resilience says you need to be down in order to get back up and feel like you have accomplished something. Emotions are complicated as f**k. Happiness is complicated. Everything is something that we have to be very nuanced in what we want to achieve. If we assume for a second we want to achieve flourishing, right? Then we have to see okay, what kind of inputs do we have? Then what kind of ways do we have to react? There's two parts. I develop a framework essentially and there's two parts to the framework. The first one is permission to play and desire for emotion. From a user perspective, you have to understand whether in this particular situation there's a desire for emotion. You look at what's the user's emotional state right now? Are they in an okay emotional state? What are their emotional ambitions? Do they want to go somewhere else from that state? What is the nature of the interaction? Is it a transaction? Like if I'm just transacting on American Airlines or whatever there's no way for me to infuse emotions because it isn't in any way an interaction that wires and requires that. I think a lot of brands make a mistake right at that point. They're in a situation where it should be transactional and instead they're trying to have a conversation with their user and the user doesn't want to have a conversation. The last 20 years perfected the internet as a transactional machine. If you look at all the companies that rose to power—Amazon, Google, all these travel sites—these are all transaction-based situations. We've perfected that, so we shouldn't mess with that. In that framework then, you have to see whether or not there's actually a desire for emotional interaction. Then you have to look at what the user's context is like. If we're sitting here and we're having a connection an AI would come in and say, "Oh, you seem stressed. Calm down." It's not going to go over well. It's not the right moment in time. Exactly. Then on the brand side you have to think about a lot of things as well. I think it was in 2014 Facebook actually conducted an experiment. A very controversial experiment. A very controversial experiment. They wanted to understand whether if you look at positive things in your News Feed you get happier and vice versa. If you look at negative things you get sadder, right? They conducted this experiment where they showed thousands and thousands of people neutral to positive messages and vice versa, neutral to negative messages. Then measured the sentiment in their posts, to find out whether they were happier or sadder. Low and behold, of course, they were. If you saw more negative messages you would tend to post something more negative as well. Problem was they did that completely without humans agreeing to it. They did it completely without permission. They kind of fall back to their terms and conditions and said this is fine, but ... Because they're engineers. They're engineers. They were just engineers beta testing. They were just A/B testing a theory. Exactly. They collected data and it was useful data. It was useful data, but this is the danger zone. If you look at it from the other side, in 2014 Facebook intentionally made thousands and thousands of people sad. That is ethically not correct. We are currently teetering on this edge where a couple of companies are playing with it. We see companies going to market that say "we can measure your stress level and now we're just going to apply self-optimization, gamification to it and say you have a streak of being less stressed." No one knows whether this is desired, so we've got to be very careful. You can't design what you can't understand. Cognitive interaction and especially emotions is something that we're only scratching the surface of. Every designer has to be very, very careful not to design something that we can't really understand. That by the way also prevents us from ever designing or in the near future designing Ex Machina, right? Of course. We can't design a machine yet that has ambitions when we don't really understand how ambitions are formed. We can't really understand an emotional crazy manipulator, when we don't understand how emotions work and why they work with one person and not with the other. Then of course there's the laws of robotics that apply as well, which the first law being don't harm a human being or neglect, allow a human being to be harmed. I'm not worried about the Ex Machina thing. I'm more worried about the lack of knowledge and therefore cheap tricks, like when you think about the Hershey Smile Machine where you're going up and if you smile you get a free Hershey's. There is something Pavlovian about that, more than anything else. Exactly. We're not Pavlovian dogs and I'm guaranteeing you this is not a genuine smile. The smile only turns genuine once you have the chocolate. We're turning things around in a weird way because we're playing, we're trying to figure it out. I think you're right about the Hershey experiment, but there is technology that can tell whether or not that smile is genuine or not. Right. The question is who's going to be allowed to get that information? Obviously for the user, it would be great. That could be positive feedback. It could help you run your life better, but should your employer have access to that information? Should brands have access to that information? Then what are the rules about what they can do with that information? Because right now there are basically no rules. If you look at the permission to play, that framework, is it the right context? Do you have active permission from the user? I think at this point there needs to be an active agreement that needs to be made, so I can't just go and scan you from afar and say, "This person is happy or this person is sad," or monitor you in terms of employment. Of course it's tricky because that environment is an owned environment and you enter, you actively agree into that owned environment when you sign up for a job somewhere. They read your emails, or they could potentially, you agree to that. Then what is the purpose again of that understanding? Is the purpose to change your emotions for emotional well-being or is the purpose productivity, which are not the same thing. Employers sometimes try to make them the same thing because it would be beautiful if they could, but they aren't. I think in that framework the other thing is, does the company actually have a value proposition that allows them to play in that space? Because we are just at the cusp of research, a lot of the work that's being done is being done in some sort of well-being, like stress, weight loss, with people who have difficulty decoding emotions. It's very much a well-being, a health kind of space situation, but it's not going to stay there. What's your value proposition that you can play there and then do you actually have the right intelligence? Do you actually know and have the right algorithms to decode what you're seeing? Then understanding of what comes out of it. When you look at that framework, you fill it with basically three different ways that a machine can interact. The first one is it reacts like a machine. It understands the emotional input, but it outputs like a machine. Conversational IVRs do that, right? They route you. They understand your stress level, but they route you or expedite you to a human being so it's like a switchboard much more than anything. Or safety in cars, the car understands that you're dozing off or that you get angry. They react like a machine by either pulling over or stopping the machine. They can read the emotion, they can acknowledge it, but then they react like a machine instead of reacting like a human. Exactly. That's the first option. The second option is this idea of the machine reacting like an extension of self. There's two parts to it. The one is to make the emotions visible for the user so it's a learning experience, telling you your stress level is high. Telling you your anger level is high, or things like that. [It's a] little bit [like] Big Hero 6...diagnostics. It's this idea of just kind of exposing it, but the user is in full control of changing the emotions or acting in any way shape or form. This is the space that we are very comfortable in right now, but the space moves very easily into a space of empathy. The question arises, would we ever be willing to pay for a service like that with the premise that this service is uniquely here for us? The service doesn't take ads like Apple. It isn't doing ads and things like that, and therefore we pay for it to be uniquely for us. Then the last one is the idea of reacting like a human. That is the idea that I as a user enter an agreement with the machine allowing that machine to manipulate my emotion still based or with the premise of my well-being, but I actively enter into the agreement that this machine can manipulate my emotions. You give it some independence. You give it some independence and you give it some permission to give you advice. And to steer you. To steer you, yes. That Facebook experiment was very instructive. They figured out what makes people sad, what makes people happy. I can imagine people saying, "Well, I'll pay an extra $5 a month for a Facebook feed that makes me happy." Right. It makes me "happier," I should say. It makes me happier, exactly. I didn't know this, but in the research I found when you ask Alexa or tell Alexa, "Alexa, I'm really sad," she actually reacts like a scene from Big Hero 6. She's like, "I'm sorry you feel that way. Sometimes listening to music or taking a walk or calling friends or talking to friends helps. I hope you feel better soon." She's not qualified. This is like Google 101 research. I found this on the internet, but people are already thinking about it, engineers are thinking about it right now. It's not cognitive psychology. It's not designers. It's not even marketers, but it's engineers are thinking about these kinds of things. It comes very close and the idea that a machine that you could very soon ask a machine for this type of advice is here. It's not tomorrow. This is right now. Are there any brands or companies that are doing this well? That are providing a service that can do one of these things well? There are a couple of companies. Because we currently really just moving from research into commercial applications, there are a few companies who do interesting things in these spaces. AutoEmotive is a company that does it in the driving space, in the auto space to say okay, we're going to detect all of these things, but when you look at it it's still a little bit like a wire, it looks like a physical computing experiment a little bit.They're pretty well-funded as a start-up. Affectiva, of course, does a lot of it in the commercial space by showing people ads and having people reading the micro-expressions. It's market research, but it's important and interesting. There's one company, it's called SimSensei, and it looks a little bit like talking to a SIM, but the idea is this. In PTSD treatment and things like that, especially young men, soldiers have huge difficulties talking to therapists because of the stigma of the shrink and so forth. They've developed an emotionally reacting or empathetic bot to start these conversations. While they're saying okay, these conversations aren't necessarily the only therapy, they are just an auxiliary to real therapy, this has a huge success with this type of target audience. They feel much more comfortable talking to a machine because they think it's just out and over. It's like the guy in the research who was like, "I talked to my bot and it's done and it's out. It's over." There's a way into something that previously many people didn't have access to or had a stigma around it, where it actually starts being interesting . That's fascinating. Let me get to my closing question. I ask all my guests this. What trend, technological trend are you most concerned about going forward in the future? I do have to say it's the trend of understanding the emotions because, of course, that's why I'm talking about it. You have concerns. You're worried about this. I'm worried about this. Yale University and MIT just recently entered into an agreement to put $27 million dollars aside to think about the ethics of this. When you see some of these detections and see what comes out, it is very intimate and it is very close to mind reading. I don't know your thoughts, but I know your feelings. There's something to that that we have to see how we get comfortable with it. I do, however, think that there's this constant adaption curve between what technology can do and what humans want. It's kind of like playing tennis, right? Something comes out in terms of a technology capability and we're like, "Okay cool." Then at some point we toss the ball back and we're like, "No, not cool. We don't want it." I think a similar thing is going to happen here as well and potentially there's an idea that with the idea of exposing these emotions we become more in tune with them as well. We're talking about mind reading, but even less than mind reading it could be mass manipulation, technological-based manipulation. Right. Which is concerning. It's concerning, and if you look at the balance you know we're talking about $27 million here and then an expected $36 billion on the other side. This is a little bit of chump change to put aside for the ethics of it. I do think that all technological advances make us think and make us adapt as humankind in an extremely lightning speed. I think that this is another piece of that. In terms of positivity, positive trends, what do you see? What trend do you think that gives you great hope and that you're really excited about? I am very excited about the idea of not having to interact with machines as a screen anymore because I do think that where we're going with conversational UIs and additional UIs and non-UIs, like truly non-UIs as well is we are coming back to an idea of why we originally invented machines. That is an idea to for us as humans have more of the thing that we value most, which is time and live the life we want to live. Just now that we are out of this idea of serving a machine because we have to learn their commands, but actually having a machine listen more. We're coming closer to that original promise, so I'm very, very happy to see where that goes. Is there a gadget that you use everyday that you are just in love with, that changed your life? My Philips Hue. Really? Yes. It's so crazy. Yeah, I have it at home only in one room and I love being able to wake up with light versus waking up with an alarm, which is always a horrendous sound. I love changing the moods and things like that and I love the potential that it has as well once it's connected and once it might be able to be connected to my biometrics to just do things by itself. I think lighting is such a fantastic small mood changer and to be able to connect these things. I've heard a lot of people say that. I was very dismissive of intelligent light bulbs because they were very expensive and I didn't see the utility. Once I installed them in my house, I use them every day. Yeah, it's crazy.

Perhaps you have heard about the mysterious world of AdWords. Or maybe you live under a rock, and neither of these is true. Let’s look at it this way: You need a new project management tool and you’re ready to explore your options. Maybe you’re even ready to download a product spec sheet or submit a form for more information. Possibly even make a purchase. You’ve got some down time on a Tuesday evening while sitting on the couch at home, so you grab your phone, which is obviously sitting right next to you, and you open up your favorite search app — Chrome or Safari — and you Google “top project management tools for business.” The first three or four results on the page — ones that you’re likely to click on — are paid ads, also known as AdWords. As a business owner, if you’re not running Google AdWords you’re missing out on a huge opportunity to acquire new leads. Roughly 80 percent of all online searches happen on Google. Searching often correlates with intent; intent to begin the research process, learn something new, contact a company, and potentially make a purchase. When done right, advertising through Google AdWords is an effective tactic within your marketing strategy. Before integrating AdWords into your marketing, ask yourself the following questions: Do you have the resources to maintain it? AdWords is not a “set it and forget it” service. Without ongoing campaign maintenance and optimization, your AdWords campaigns will perform terribly and you’ll essentially be wasting your money. On the other hand, a well-optimized campaign can help you beat competitors while actually spending less. Pro Tip: Do not hire an intern to maintain your AdWords campaign. AdWords is a very elaborate system — it’s best to leave it to the pros. Do you have a responsive website? Given that over half of all searches take place on a mobile device (yes, even in B2B markets), if you send your new audience to a poorly optimized website, they’re going to hit the “back" button faster than you can say, “AdWords.” Have you clearly defined your goals and objectives? Because of the time, effort and expertise it takes to run an AdWords campaign, it can be a large expense. Just like any marketing initiative, it is critical to define your goals up front so you can determine your success. Define your target conversion rates and cost-per-acquisition. Do a bit of math to ensure that your investment will generate a return for you. AdWords will not save your business If you’re selling a terrible product and have poor messaging, AdWords won’t save you. Those fundamentals need to be in place prior to investing in AdWords. AdWords is just one tool within your marketing toolbox. Be sure that all your efforts are integrated to produce the best results for your company.

Google always does a great job, from the Pokemon Google Maps overlay to a smart mailbox, but there are a few from other companies worth mentioning. Here's a rundown of all the hillarious (or strange) tech-related April Fools Day jokes from around the web. Google Gnome One of Google's product launches from last year was the Google Home, a $129 smart speaker with Google Assistant. Now the company is teasing the "Google Gnome," an outside version of the Home. You can ask it weather questions, let it control your lawnmower and other tools, and even dress it up in accessories. The Google Gnome has a page on the Google Store, but unfortunately you can't buy it. I really want a rain coat for my Google Home, though. Mrs. Pac-Man in Google Maps For April Fools' 2015, Google added Pac-Man into Google Maps and Ingress. This year, Mrs Pac-Man is invading Google Maps. For regions of the world already on April 1st, a new Mrs. Pac-Man button is visible on the mobile app. You then have to control Mrs. Pac-Man on real-life streets, and of course, outrun the Ghosts. Google's Bubble Wrap Keyboard (English subtitles are available) Google Japan's prank is pretty funny - it's a bubble wrap keyboard. The idea is to pop bubbles on a bubble wrap sheet to form words, then feed the sheet through a reader to send the message. Some of the bubble wrap sheets are even scented. Google Assistant Google has plenty of Easter Eggs in Google Assistant, and as you might expect, there's one for April Fools' Day too. When asked, Assistant will offer advice on how not to get pranked, such as "If something seems too good to be true today, it probably is." Google Wind Google's Netherlands division has its own April Fools' Day gag, named 'Google Wind.' The idea is to use machine learning to control the weather, using Holland's famous windmills. I'll admit, this one is pretty great. Netflix Live Will Arnet has been in plenty of Netflix original content, from BoJack Horseman to A Series of Unfortunate Events. For April Fools' Day, Netflix is proud to share 'Netflix Live', which is nearly an hour of Arnett commentating ordinary events like toasting bread and completing a crossword puzzle. It's actually funnier than it sounds. You can watch the full thing here (a Netflix subscription is required). T-Mobile ONEsie T-Mobile's prank is a onesie, with "full-body coverage" and a built-in 4G LTE hotspot. You can actually buy it for $40, but the real one doesn't have any tech inside it. Hulu Hu With the claim that the human attention span has "dropped to eight seconds," Hulu has released 'Hu.' It's just a library of short clips from existing Hulu content, and you actually need an account to see them. This is probably the lamest April Fools' Day gag in the list - better luck next year, guys. OnePlus Dash drink OnePlus is really proud of its Dash Charge feature, even to the point of enlisting celebrities to talk about it. For April Fools', the company made real Dash Charge energy drinks. You can find our review of the drink here. Lyft Mono For April Fools' Day, Lyft has announced the 'Lyft Mono.' It's a wearable glove, vaguely resembling a Nintendo Power Glove. This gag is actually real, and once you put it on and get the app, sticking out your thumb will hail a Lyft cab. You can sign up to for a chance to get one here. Honor BFF We all need some positive reinforcement every now and then, right? Honor thinks so, and created the Honor BFF. This imaginary phone uses machine learning to periodically give you compliments and motivation. Hopefully it ships with Android 7.1 Nougat. Google Haptic Helpers This is probably my favorite gag so far. In order to create a more realistic virtual reality experience, you can schedule a "haptic helper" to come to your house and help create a more realistic environment. Just watch the video, it's hilarious. Amazon Petlexa Alexa is cool and all, but your furry friends need one too. As the name implies, Petlexa is Alexa for your pets. Contour by SlickWraps Putting a skin on your phone or tablet is too much work. For April Fool's Day, Slickwraps is teasing the 'Countour' - a machine that sprays on device skins. Frankly, I'm not sure if this is actually real or not, but there is a page for it on SlickWrap's store. Nvidia GTX G-Assist How many times have you been playing an online game, only to be interrupted by someone in real life? NVIDIA has made the 'G Assist,' a flash drive that can take over for you if you're busy. It can also help you beat boss battles, and provides periodic reminders to consume energy drinks. More information and a video can be found here. Google's data center on Mars If you have important data, you need a backup. That's why Google announced its first interplanetary data center, named "Ziggy Stardust," on the Google Cloud Platform Blog today. Located in the Gale Crater on Mars, it will store a cache of data from Earth to prevent irrecoverable loss when a planetary disaster strikes. Google hopes to finish the data center by 2018. LineageOS' mascot CyanogenMod's mascot, Cid, was one of the most recognizable icons in the Android community. As the spiritual successor to CyanogenMod, LineageOS has created its own mascot - 'Ink'. The project also announced 'Br0zip,' an artificial intelligence that can port LineageOS to any device in no time at all. Chromebook accessories Even though most Chromebooks can now run Android apps, you still can't use your Chromebook like an Android phone/tablet for all use cases. Until now, that is. Google has announced a Chromebook Groupie Stick (seen above), a Chromebook Cardboard headset, and a Chromebook armband. See the company's blog post for more info. Exynos Yoga Processor Remember when curved phones were a thing? Maybe we'll see more in the coming months, because Samsung has just unveiled the Exynos Yoga Processor - the first flexible mobile SoC. Anyone up for a Galaxy Flex? Carved screen protector Carved is a small Indiana-based phone case company, but now they are working on a wooden screen protector. Why hasn't this been done before? I'll take ten. I'm Feeling Woof/I'm Feeling Meow By force-touching the Google app icon in iOS, you can select "I'm Feeling Woof" or "I'm Feeling Meow." These give your pets access to the stuff they care about - from dog food to balls of yarn. More info can be found on Google's blog post. Waze maps for Mars According to the company's blog, Waze is has begun to map the surface of Mars. Certain members of the Waze community will also be sent to the Red Planet to more accurately map the surface. JerryRigEverything's NoPhone video If you haven't heard about it, the NoPhone is a solid piece of plastic designed to simulate the feeling of a phone in your pocket. I'm not really sure if anyone uses it, but JerryRigEverything is happy to break it just as much as any other phone. Google Translate for Heptapod B Using machine learning, Google Translate can now decrypt messages written in Heptapod B - the language from the film Arrival. On an unrelated note, it looks like someone from Google is still rocking a Nexus 10. See Google's blog post for more info. Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s ASUS has an April Fools gag too - the Zenfone Zoooooom Extreme HDR 1.7s Veritas Blue Limited Special Edition. I would probably buy this phone. MKBHD's Nokia 3310 review You may have heard about the updated Nokia 3310, but it turns out the original is an amazing smartphone. Okay, maybe not, but the video is pretty funny. Open GApps Femto Do you need to flash the latest Gapps package on your device, but you don't have a stable network connection? Not to worry, the Open GApps Femto package is here to help. It uses the United States HAARP service (which is not real, but just pretend) to download the latest GApps package. You can find more info at the GApps blog.   That concludes our coverage of April Fools' Day in the tech world. Let us know in the comments below which gag you liked the most!

Yeah they actuqally had me going until I compared a whois of kodi.tv vs kickasstorrents.com, a site that actually was seized. The whois data would show that it is not official. Derik Taylor So this is one I find interesting. Could it technically be a criminal offense to falsify a domain seizure? How would that work? mondeca I hope every year that Google will announce something real and awesome on April Fools' Day, like they did with Gmail. Once again, I am disappointed.

Trooper311 Gimme dat gnome yo. abqnm The Google Haptic Helpers was OK, until they applied the "I Voted!" sticker to the guy's shirt. I was laughing and crying at the same time. Corbin Davenport Yep, that had me laughing too. AdrianFDiratama . How about JG I'd actually like to see Google produce the Google Gnome.... All they'd need to do is add a battery (and Qi charging) to a Google Home and stick it in a new Gnome shell... Make sure its IP68 and maybe even MIL-STD-810G certified. It'd be a fun little gadget to put on the picnic table of your next summer back yard get together. Pump out some tunes, order pizza & Ubers for everyone to go home in, etc... Or take out when you work in the garden & don't want to get your phone dirty... Maybe even produce one with an LTE radio (and GPS). Then you could take it out of WiFi range camping. Wake up and find him chilling next to your tent in his little chair "Hey Google, how's today's weather? When does the rafting place open? How far away from the camp site is it?" cdotlawrence Maybe like a more customizable (from a looks standpoint), durable, & usable-on-go version of Home? Google Home Pro/Ultra? Interesting idea, but not sure why you wouldn't do most of the things it would do on your phone. Some specific use cases like you mentioned but beyond those, idk. Guess it'd be a highly functional, portable, durable and customizable speaker? Suicide_Note Ms. Pac-Man in Maps is live for me here in the US, even though it isn't April 1st yet. Daishi No Clarity Speaker??? Artem Russakovskii Why would that be in this post? Urmil Shroff What if we actually get the Mars data center many years from now? Eumelanin Knight I love this day.

Google explains why the Android Wear 2.0 rollout was delayed for some watches Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/03/30 9:44am PDTMar 30, 2017 25 Plus 1 on G+ 33 Share on Facebook 50 Share on Twitter Total Shares108 Android Wear News You might have heard about Valve Time - the tendency for video game company Valve to release games and features long after the intended date. Google is also guilty of this, with apps and features still rolling out weeks after being announced. Many Android Wear users were left wondering why their watches had not received the much-anticipated 2.0 update weeks after the rollout supposedly started, but know we know why. Google has confirmed to Wareable.com that the update was delayed to fix a bug. We haven't asked Google ourselves, but this is the statement provided by Wareable: "We have started rolling out the Android Wear 2.0 update to Fossil Q Founder, Casio Smart Outdoor Watch WSD-F10 and Tag Heuer Connected. For other devices, the update is currently being delayed due to a bug found in final testing. We will push the update to the remaining devices as soon as the issue is resolved." Considering Android Wear 2.0 was initially slated for a late 2016 release, and was even delayed, it's rather annoying that all the bugs were not properly ironed out already. But pushing a buggy update to users probably wouldn't have worked out very well. Source: Wareable Tags android wear android wear 2.0 bug delayed rollout subscribe ...

Morten Ulv How would developers have their aps ready? Morten Ulv How would developers have their apps ready? :) Đức Thành It's nothing serious, but this is just another example of poor planning. Please don't turn this into a habit, Google. I love Google, but honestly nobody wants to hear your excuses when you are doing business. Especially when all of this could be solved very easily if you just wait until the final product is ready *before* announcing a release date. demarcmj It's already become a habit. Đức Thành Worse, it might become an addiction. mattcoz Stop being ridiculous, if they planned for the possibility of bugs then it would never get released. Nothing is ever released completely free of bugs. They never announced a date for the update of older devices. Đức Thành I was being very reasonable, in fact. You are correct that it is nearly impossible to plan for the possibility of bugs, but that wasn't the point. The point is Google should learn how to do estimations more accurately, and move the release date to a more appropriate time, preferably later than how they usually do it. If you are going to release it late anyway (and this has happened a bunch of times, there's no reason Google can't learn from it), why not announce the ETA a little bit later and take more time to prepare, instead of making the service users wait in anticipation? There is always unknown risks and it's probably not possible yet to account for all the possibilities things could go wrong, but risks are something that can be managed. NexusMan It was announced 2 weeks ago I'd get it by the end of this month...And I got it yesterday. Đức Thành Well that's not too bad then? I was making the comments based on the observation that Google missed the deadline they set for themselves for some of the devices. Two questions though: What is your device and does the timely update for your device also apply for all other devices? Actually, if the answer to that last question is "no," I've got one more question: Have you read the article? (Not trying to be rude or anything, just curious.) NexusMan In February, in a blog post, Google announced "Android Wear 2.0 will be available for all supported watches in the coming weeks." Still not sure what your complaint is. Yesterday was "the coming weeks" from February and unless the world ends, there are still more weeks to come. mattcoz The point is, no matter how long they wait to there is a chance something will crop up afterwards. It happens, that's why it's only an estimate. Đức Thành The point is Google can learn to make better estimations. NexusMan You're right. They should just do like Samsung and release devices that catch on fire. Rush everything...Software, devices and batteries to market. Who cares if it's ready? Đức Thành If that was sarcasm, I think you might have missed my point. To clarify, my point wasn't for Google to "release products on time according to the announced ETA," but to "make sure most of the preparation for the product launch are well taken care of *and then* announce an ETA for the products." Whether there was a misunderstanding or I not, I hope I have made it clear. NexusMan I didn't miss your point. My point is stuff happens. Frawlz You would have thought this is what the beta was for...... Stephen Cornwell Until it's released it's still pre-release software, as the quote says the bud we was found in final testing we're talking about a release candidate, which is where bugs are found. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Bugs are found at every stage. Even after release. With each phase a wider range of devices are exposed to the software raising the likelihood for a bug to surface. JD With Google its always beta Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Popular opinion is that the bug is Qualcomm/SnapDragon related, hence the earlier release of the update for Intel chipset watches: Fossil, Tag Heuer, Casio. The other guess is that this bug has something to do with battery drain or faulty power management, something some of the new LG watches (Sport, Style) seem to suffer from. Still, using the Dev Preview on my Huawei Watch I haven't experienced any bad battery, I still get around 1.5 days with always on screen and tilt to wake using my own watch-face/launcher. Corbin Davenport Maybe, the Polar M600 is also getting the update now, and it has a MediaTek processor. Matt Mine isn't. I contacted Polar the other day and support said they had no new news about when it was going out. Matt "We were told it was going to be released mid to late March. Unfortunately we don't have an ETA on that release data but it should be very soon." That was March 22. Matt Of course now I see the latest article. Nicholas Polydor BTW, @corbin_davenport , the site is Wareable.com not Wearable.com (not that I'm sure why they spelt it that way, mind!) TheJester Polar comfirmed me the update until end of next week on twitter. Rob Smith I have Polar M600, and I got update last night! Andy Webber Could be something introduced after the last beta. mattcoz Most likely the case, and they were probably focused on testing for the SD2100 leading up to the release. Jordan L Solid analysis. Also, I get about 1.5days on my Huawei Watch w/ Dev Preview, using a WatchMaker face too. King_Android "We found a bug, that we are trying to iron out" = The quickest way to stop us nerds from complaining so much. demarcmj Google was good at updating stuff when they only had a few devices to worry about. They have been progressively becoming worse and worse as the amount of "stuff" to manage has grown. This "bug" non-explanation is the same excuse they gave for making Nexus 6 users wait on 7.0. In that case, as well as this, there was a lengthy beta program that is ostensibly supposed to be used to iron out the bugs. mattcoz That's generally how it works, and no beta period ever irons out all the bugs. kenspiracy Honestly, with everything I've heard about how AW2.0 handles notifications, I'm not even sure I want the update on my Moto 360. Leonardo Baez If it is 1st gen it wont update kenspiracy It's not. Stephen Cornwell I've been running it for months, the notifications are much better than 1.0. jstew182 I have been searching for a while now trying to find a good video showing how notifications work on 2.0. Does the name of the person still stay at the bottom of the screen when they message you or does it show an icon or what? thespacecowboy How about not launching a product/release until it's ready? This was updated/posted early February, nearly two months ago. https://developer.android.com/wear/index.html Middlefinger Dont be daft, this is Google we are talking about. mattcoz Maybe the bug didn't present itself until after the release when testing on older hardware. Đức Thành Sorry but that's not an explanation, that's an excuse. Then why not test the software on those older hardware? mattcoz That's when the bug appeared, during testing. jubby2000 Wareable* Mitch Brown I am all for Google doing quality control. I would rather wait longer and get something that works. Anyone who has run a Windows based system knows what working with bugs in the system is like. That's what I like about Android, I experience very few problems working with Android or Chrome OS. Can't say the same for Windows 10. Aditya Singh I have fossil q founder 2.0. When will my watch get android wear 2 ? George Garrett Must be a serious bug. Huawei replaced my Nexus 6p after they said the Android 7.0 update nuked a third of my battery capacity; and that was an actual release. The wear 2.0 update must've done something terrible. Stoneule Hilarious. Once again Google is finding ways to destroy Android Wear. Incredible really. In fact is there anything from io2016 that wasn't a complete disaster? I'll say it for the 100th time, get rid of Sundar. Google needs new leadership JD Oh Google no one cares for your BS excuses. You're not a startup anymore. Nick Coad Cool, now explain to me why the LG Sport and LG Style are so shit. NexusMan Because they're made by LG. Teja Seriously, Android Wear is where Google is not good enough to compete with Samsung Gear both in terms of battery life and software experience. Sad. roflcopter pilot delays happen. unfortunately so does shitty communication. Sean Thomas AW 2.0 announced at IO 2016....just going to be rolling out to devices by IO 2017. Good job Google lmao. Rob Smith I got AW 2.0 for M600 TODAY! Martin Buerkle Yeah big bummer. I got the 2nd Gen Moto 360 and got it because It seemed to be getting the update on schedule. And the new Google Sport of course was sold out day one and the thickness is really ugly. Hopefully Google gets their act together, many products and apps are suffering from human incompetence.
