Google’s installation of 1Gbps fiber-optic internet service in several Silicon Valley cities has been put on hold while the company considers infrastructure alternatives, according to The Mercury News and Ars Technica. San Jose, Mountain View, Sunnyvale, Santa Clara, and Palo Alto were and still are on the list for superspeedy internet access, according to city officials and Google. The cities were recently surprised to learn the schedules have been pushed back.  Mike Fuller, Mountain View public works director, said, “We didn’t expect it because we were working on what was their plan at the time.” Related: Are you on the list? Google Fiber is going to these cities next In San Jose, final permits that were ready in May marked the expected launch of a three-year construction project. Estimates were that 60 percent of the fiber-optic cable would be underground and 40 percent aerial, on utility poles. Almost 100 employees set to install Google Fiber in San Jose last month were informed of the delay and offered transfers to work on an unrelated project in San Diego. According to fiber-optic installer Salvador Bustamonte, “They said that Google was going to re-evaluate this whole project because they were thinking of going aerial.” Google’s parent company Alphabet Inc. is in the process of buying point-to-point wireless data company Webpass, Inc. That deal is expected to be done by the end of summer. Because Webpass’s technology offers internet service at the same gigabyte speed as Google Fiber, once the acquisition is complete, Google will have three choices: cables laid underground, cables strung pole-to-pole,and point-to-point wireless. Digging up city streets to run cable underground is time-consuming and costly. According to The Mercury News, AT&T and Comcast have been making it difficult for Google to use existing, privately owned utility poles. If point-to-point wireless can provide service as fast as fiber-optic cable, the Webpass acquisition could keep Google out of the ground and off the poles, and into the air. Google Fiber spokesperson Veronica Navarrete confirmed the company is still talking with the Silicon Valley cities but said it “takes time” to deploy “the latest technologies in alignment with our product road map while understanding local considerations and challenges.” From the national perspective, The Mercury News reported, “Google Fiber is already up and running in seven other major cities, outside California, but a source familiar with the project says the company is putting additional fiber locations on the back burner to reassess the technology and explore a cheaper alternative — wireless service that does not require expensive, capital-intensive, and time-consuming installation of fiber cables under the ground. The source said Google is now focusing more on aerial installation.” For cities on the Google Fiber lists — in California and other states — delays in gigabyte internet have to be frustrating. If, however, it turns out that new technologies or combinations thereof enable faster and less expensive gigabyte internet rollouts, many more cities could benefit.

According to the San Jose Mercury News, Alphabet has told Palo Alto and Mountain View that it will be pushing back Fiber’s rollout while it considers cheaper options, and those options may include switching to aerial service rather than traditional landlines. Alphabet’s move seems to have come as a shock to local officials who had been involved in the project. “It was a surprise,” Mountain View public works director Mike Fuller told the San Jose Mercury News. “We didn’t expect it because we were working on what was their plan at the time.” Google Fiber has been slowly rolling out to more cities across the United States, with six cities already supported and possibly dozens more in the pipeline, but the company has run into trouble along the way, including intense resistance from traditional internet service providers (ISPs) like AT&T. Earlier this year, AT&T filed a lawsuit to fight a new ordinance in Louisville, Kentucky, that would have made it easier for Google to use existing utility poles to build infrastructure for Fiber. This may be one reason why Google is look to avoid the poles entirely by moving to wireless service. Alphabet has already brought Fiber one step closer to this reality with its recent acquisition of San Francisco-based ISP Webpass Inc. Webpass uses point-to-point wireless technology that is capable of speeds comparable with Fiber, but with a much lower cost for infrastructure. Earlier this year, Alphabet CEO Eric Schmidt also talked about the company’s own experiments with point-to-point wireless internet, saying that it would be “cheaper than digging up your garden” to install. RELATED:  What you missed in Big Data: AI continues to gain momentum “The best way to predict the future is to invent it,” Schmidt said at the time. “We start from that premise here at Alphabet.” Image courtesy of Alphabet Inc About Latest Posts Eric David Eric David is a staff writer for SiliconANGLE, covering the latest trends in social media and gaming.

They slipped $1.59 to close at $24.01. A dismal July, which saw sales fall by 4 percent, put a halt to the turnaround that the San Francisco retailer had reported in June. Banana Republic had the worst showing, with a 14 percent decline, Gap stores saw a 4 percent drop, and Old Navy sales were flat. High-speed delay Google has told Mountain View and Palo Alto that it is putting plans to provide lightning-fast fiber Internet service on hold while it explores a cheaper alternative, Bay Area News Group reported. And nearly 100 employees hired to install Google Fiber in San Jose were told that project was being delayed, according to workers. Google’s parent company, Alphabet, recently acquired Webpass, and is expected to adopt its technology, which involves sending aerial data between transmitters on top of buildings, avoiding digging up city streets. Want to save money? Move away What’s the worst place to live in the U.S. if you want to save money? Oh, come on, take a wild guess. Yes, San Francisco indeed topped a list put together by Go BankingRates and published by Business Insider. Oakland was third and San Jose 13th (it didn’t rank higher only because average workers earned so much). Of the 15 cities on the list, only New York and Miami were outside California.

Moving forward, the browser will “de-emphasize” Flash in favor of HTML5. The slow bandaid-pull starts in September with Chrome 53. Google’s reasoning for the switch is Flash is — well, Flash: Today, more than 90% of the Flash on the web loads behind the scenes to support things like page analytics. This kind of Flash slows you down, and starting this September, Chrome 53 will begin to block it. HTML5 is much lighter and faster, and publishers are switching over to speed up page loading and save you more battery life. You’ll see an improvement in responsiveness and efficiency for many sites. TNW Answers Your questions answered by founders, experts and thought leaders in business, design and tech. Join a chat The slow murder of Flash won’t take long, though. By the time Chrome 55 hits in December, Google plans to have HTML5 as the only option for Chrome users — unless a site only supports Flash. If you visit a Flash site, Google will prompt you to turn it on for that page. HTML5 will always be the default. It’s not surprising; we’d been expecting this for some time, and Google is simply following Safari and Edge in moving away from Flash.

Facebook Twitter Google RSS Cloud Mobile Social Big Data Bleeding Edge Columns Get McAfee’d Dr. Bitcoin smartworld Future Data City of Paradigm Masthead Send Us a News Tip Select Page Latest Google Nexus rumors: October launch date, new ‘Nexus Launcher’, carrier-branded devices, more by Collen Kriel | Aug 9, 2016 | 0 comments As a possible launch date for the 2016 Google Nexus devices draws near, the rumors continue to pile up with what we can expect. Rumors about the codenamed Sailfish and Marlin devices include HTC Corp. as manufacturers, minimal branding, and a new electric blue color option. The smaller Sailfish is rumored to have a 5-inch 1080p AMOLED display and a 2,770 mAh battery. The Marlin will come with a 5.5-inch 2560 ×1440 AMOLED display and a 3,450 mAH battery. Both devices will have a rumored 4GB of RAM, an option between 32GB or 128GB of storage, and the latest Qualcomm processor, but no SD card slot. They will have a 12MP rear camera and an 8MP front-facing camera, a fingerprint scanner and USB Type-C port, but will keep the headphone jack.   We look at the latest rumors making the rounds about the Nexus devices, including a possible October launch date, a new Google home screen – the Nexus Launcher, carrier-branded Nexuses, and more. Launch date Google launched the Nexus 6P and 5X in September 2015, so if a similar launch schedule is followed for the Nexus ‘Marlin’ and ‘Sailfish’ devices we could see the new devices launch next month. However, other launch date rumors have the new devices being unveiled as early as this month, alternatively other rumors suggest we will have to wait until October 4 for the new devices, according to DroidLife. LG Electronics Inc. has also stated that its LG V20 due to be launched next month will be the first phone to have Android 7.0 Nougat “out of the box”. Therefore an October launch for the Google Nexus devices is looking more likely. Nexus Launcher A new Google home screen is rumored for the new Nexus devices called the Nexus Launcher. The two layout changes for the launcher include the replacement of the app drawer button with a small up arrow. To access the app drawer on the Nexus Launcher users will swipe up on the arrow. The bottom row of icons remains static on every home screen, but the replacement of the app drawer button frees up space for another app icon. Example of the Nexus Launcher, via Android Police.   The other layout change for the Nexus Launcher is the Google Search bar has been replaced with a ‘G’ tab. The new tab is only displayed on the left of the main home screen, unlike the Search bar which was displayed across all home screens. Access Google Now by swiping left on the screen (this feature can be disabled) or open up Search by tapping the ‘G’ tab. The removal of the Search bar also frees up space for a static calendar widget. Android Police expects the new launcher will contain more Google Assistant functionality that is expected on the 2016 Nexus phones. Various wallpaper options Wallpaper options include various options from 500px, and possible live wallpapers called ‘Live Earth’ and ‘Live Data’. There is also an option to subscribe to a specific wallpaper category, which will automatically change your wallpaper on a daily basis.   Swipe for notifications Google are also due to introduce a new gesture for accessing notifications on the Nexus devices, according to Android Police. Swiping down on the fingerprint scanner on the rear of the device will open the notification tray. Whether the Nexus 5X and 6P (main image), which also have fingerprint scanners, will also get the new feature is unknown at this stage. Carrier-branded Nexus devices According to various sources, including renowned technology leaker Evan Blass, Google are planning carrier-branded Nexus devices. Both Blass and other sources state there will be a Verizon version. Verizon is going to carry the two “Nexus” handsets (note the quotation marks). — Evan Blass (@evleaks) August 5, 2016 A carrier-branded Nexus is likely to come with a variety of bloatware, while updates are usually delayed on carrier-branded devices.

PREGNANCY BABY TODDLER BIG KID TEEN EDUCATION SPED KIDS WELLNESS FAMILY LIFE CELEBRITY MOMS Daddy ‘Google Nexus 2016’ Smartphones Set to Launch; Updates, Features, and Release Date Revealed By Charles Andrews, Parent Herald August 09, 08:00 am TAG google, Google Nexus, HTC, smartphone, news, technology "Google Nexus 2016," the latest in Google's "Nexus" smartphone line will soon be releasing two new products to compete against other leading smartphone brands. With Samsung releasing the "S7 Edge" earlier in March and the "Note 7" on August 19, and Apple rumored to be releasing the new "iPhone 7" in early September, "Google Nexus 2016" is looking to catch up with two new smartphones, the "Sailfish" and the "Marlin". Advertisement Google has been releasing its own smartphone line since they came out with the"Nexus One" in 2010, and after several years later, it has become a real player in smartphone game. With the highly anticipated release of the "Google Nexus 2016", here's what we know so far. Google has partnered up with Taiwanese technological hardware brand HTC, for the two "Google Nexus 2016" phones, namely, the "Sailfish" and it's pricier, high-end version, the "Marlin". The two "Nexus" phones will offer the same features, though the larger "Marlin" will have a longer battery life with better resolution says BGR. The Android Police has revealed the specs for only one of the "Google Nexus 2016" phones, namely the "Marlin". The "Marlin" will feature  a 5.5 QHD AMOLED display, a USB-C port, a 12 MP back camera, an 8 MP front camera, a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner, 4 GB worth of RAM, bottom speakers, and Bluetooth 4.2. The "Sailfish" will undoubtedly have the same specs, albeit a few minor differences. The "Google Nexus 2016" phones will be running on Android's latest software, the "Nougat 7.0", and will have quite the processor with the powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon, according to PC Advisor. This promises that both "Nexus" phones will give their soon-to-be owners an ever better and faster smartphone. The release date for the "Google Nexus 2016" phones is rumored to be early October, though many are speculating an earlier release, to match the launch of Android's new "Nougat 7.0" software. The price range for the "Sailfish" is set around $300, while the higher end "Marlin" is somewhere around the $450 dollar mark.  © 2016 ParentHerald.com All rights reserved.

Flickr Creative Commons Google Nexus Swipe Down Fingerprint Scanner In the latest revelation made by David Ruddock of Android Police, he said that, "Google plans to introduce a new gesture to open the notification shade using the fingerprint on its new Nexus phones, slated for release later this year." Like Us on Facebook Subscribe to eNewsletter So what is this feature? Actually, it's not really brand new; as a matter of fact, Huawei has already integrated this feature with its devices - swipe fingerprint scanner. Here's how it works. Sponsored Watch Your Favorite Christian Films, 24/7. Click Here To Start Your Free Trial Today Image from: Android Police Based from the animation, all you need to do is just swipe your finger down the scanner and the device will do the rest. It's that simple! However, as Ruddock pointed out, there are two things you must know about this feature:  This could be the 'rumored Electric Blue finish we anticipate as an option on the 2016 Nexus phones Marlin and Sailfish'; and,  Home button is bugged. Ruddock added that the Home button is working though it "does occasionally misbehave and get stuck in this 'open' animated state as it's currently implemented. It should retract the two green and blue dots when it's not actively being utilized." He believes, "that the dots and the fact that they animate mean the home button will be used to call up Google Assistant, as Google used this animation when announcing Assistant at I/O." Live and Static Wallpapers In an earlier report, Ruddock revealed that Google "is working on a tremendous number of new live wallpapers with varying animations and functions (yep, functional LWPs, from Google)." There are also a number of wonderful static wallpapers which Google plans to unveil on the upcoming Nexus phones. Check out this link to view the images. It is not sure though if these are all the wallpapers; hopefully, there will be more to come. Smaller Nexus Handset Specs Meanwhile, John McCann of TechRadar.com has something related to the smaller Nexus handset, "New benchmarking details for the smaller Nexus handset suggest it'll come with a Full HD 5-inch display, a Snapdragon 820 processor and a 7MP selfie camera." Richard Goodwin of KnowYourMobile.com suggested that "one or both of the Nexus phones for 2016 will feature Qualcomm's new Snapdragon 821 CPU, which the chip-maker claims is 10% faster than the current Snapdragon 820 model found inside the HTC 10, Galaxy S7, LG G5 and OnePlus 3." Putting this thought together suggests that so if McCann's and Goodwin's sources are true, the smaller handset could have Snapdragon 820 while the bigger one will have Snapdragon 821. We'll bring you more updates on the upcoming Google Nexus smartphones as soon as information becomes available so stay tuned.   Right Now Amazing 1-Year-Old Child Plays A Piano Concert On Her First Birthday.

Vine Report HOME U.S. SCIENCE/HEALTH WORLD ENTERTAINMENT TECH LIFE&STYLE Subscriptions Home TECH Google Nexus 2016 release date update: Latest leak claims Verizon tie-in, October launch Karissa Dumaraog Aug 10, 2016 8:08 AM Like Us Share on Facebook Share on Twitter (REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji)A Google employee poses with Nexus 7 tablets at a promotional event in Seoul. Google and HTC continue to be very cagey with regard to their collaborative smartphone project, codenamed Nexus "Marlin" and "Sailfish." Despite this, a tip suggesting that the devices may come with a special offer from Verizon Wireless come October hint that an announcement from the companies may be imminent. Veteran information leaker Evan Blass broke the news last week via his official Twitter account. "Verizon is going to carry the two 'Nexus' handsets," he wrote on social media. Furthermore, Blass also hinted that there might be a possibility that Verizon will rename the phones, however, this may be a little too farfetched, according to other media outlets that are also carefully following this story. If the first part of Blass's prediction turns out to be true, this would entail a slight deviation on how Google usually rolls out their smartphones. In the past, the company leaned more towards directly selling their devices to consumers without any tie-ins with cell carriers. However, the prevailing issue of users being unable to set up the Nexus devices they directly purchased from Google could be what is driving the company to partner up with mobile carriers. As for the release date, the launch of the Verizon Nexus phone may come sometime in October with an undisclosed rollout date for other cell companies who are said to also be collaborating with Google. This definitely coincides with the supposed launch of the Android 7.0 Nougat operating system. Earlier this year Google's senior vice president for Android, Hiroshi Lockheimer, said that the forthcoming software will be available this summer, however, there is still little to almost no indication that Google is gearing up for its release. Regardless of when the Nexus phones will eventually see the light of day, the online world is lit up with numerous speculations of what consumers can expect with the handsets. Based on theories, the "Marlin" iteration will be a high-end of kind of smartphone, while the "Sailfish" would be more budget-friendly.

(Photo : David Ramos/Getty Images) A rumor shows up detailing Verizon as the carrier for the upcoming Google smartphone, the HTC Nexus 2016. Verizon will be the carrier for HTC Nexus 2016, HTC Marlin and Sailfish Evan Blass, the leaker who has always been accurate so far, tweeted another detail on Nexus 2016 handsets. He stated that Verizon is going to carry the handsets. For the record, this means a come-back for Verizon as Google's phone carrier. The tech giant has been in relationships with various carriers and it's unknown whether Verizon will exclusively sell Nexus Phone or not, GSM Arena wrote. However, many Nexus fans are worried if Verizon would make the same 'mistake' just like in 2014 where the carrier placed too many not-so-useful software. They also hope to see HTC Nexus 2016 unlocked version, sold at Google's online store, like the Nexus 5X and 6P phones. Verizon is going to carry the two "Nexus" handsets (note the quotation marks). — Evan Blass (@evleaks) August 5, 2016 So far, there's a huge concern on the speculation whether Verizon becomes exclusive carrier like the previous Galaxy Nexus. Phandroid noted that users were annoyed since Verizon, not Google, controlled the updates. HTC Nexus 2016: Google smartphone specs rumor So far, the rumors on Nexus Phone 2016 revolve around its two variants, HTC Marlin and HTC Sailfish. Sailfish could be a 5-inch smartphone sporting full HD display of 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution. HTC Marlin has larger screen of 5.5 inch with Quad HD AMOLED display (2560 x 1440 pixels).  Under the hood, Nexus 2016 handsets will get quad-core Qualcomm processor with 12 MP for its rear camera and 8 MP for selfie camera. The devices are rumored to have 32 GB internal storage and 4GB space for RAM. Other speculations include the USB port C and fingerprint sensor. HTC Nexus 2016 release date The Nexus devices are expected to be released in early October.

Rosanna Marcotte, 58, sent her message of thanks to law enforcement and the people of the community that 'refuses to succumb to fear' to residents who gathered Tuesday evening for a candlelight vigil in remembrance of 27-year-old Vanessa Marcotte. One present at the vigil, led by Pastor Linda Michel in the town's First Congregational, told Daily Mail Online: 'Mrs Marcotte was too grief stricken to be there but she sent a message saying how thankful she was for the support of the community and law enforcement. 'Right now this town is reeling and we're trying to find healing and peace at a time of aching spirits and hearts.'

Share this article Share 853 shares Members of the local fire service and police stood guard outside the white clapboard church allowing those close to the family and those simply moved to attend 'space' to grieve and pray together. The congregation, several hundred strong, filled the church and its gallery, singing hymns and offering silent prayers. According to Pastor Michel the town has had its share of strife and sorrow 'but no hour has been more sorrowful than this.' Some wept as they held candles aloft and Pastor Michel urged them to reach out to Vanessa's family in letter and by telephone. Earlier, Daily Mail Online spoke with Vanessa's father, John, outside his home in nearby Leominster, where Vanessa was raised. He spoke of his torment over his only child's death and appealed to the public to help catch her killer. John, 64, said: 'How can anything ever be all right again when your only child has been horribly murdered?' Volunteer fire department personnel stand outside the church during the vigil for Vanessa Marcotte Vigil: The congregation, several hundred strong, filled the church and its gallery He said: 'I'd ask people to pray that whoever did this is caught. She was the best kid in the world. Graduated top of her class.'  Google account manager Vanessa, 27, lived in New York and was home visiting her mother, Rossana, in nearby Princeton over the weekend. She went out for a jog on Sunday afternoon and never returned. A source told Fox25 in Boston that investigators were examining the possibility that Marcotte was sexually assaulted and set on fire, with burns to her hands, head and feet. Barely 24 hours earlier her father saw her for what would be the last time. He recalled: 'I was with her. We went out to eat at the Chop House on Saturday night. After that, the next day, she was dead.' Trembling with emotion Marcotte said that there was nobody in his daughter's life who would wish to harm her though he said that this was 'part of the investigation'. According to her father, Vanessa didn't have a serious boyfriend instead, he said: 'She was 100 per cent into her job. She graduated top of her class at BU. She knew how smart she was.' Marcotte explained that Vanessa had recently got a new manager at Google and was 'excited' about her future with the company she loved. Marcotte was returning home after being with law enforcement, he explained, since 4 o'clock this morning. State troopers move in: Massachusetts officers were searching woodland around the area where the Google executive's body was discovered on Sunday night Search under way: State police crime investigators were on the scene close to Brooks Station Road in Princeton, MA, where the body of the murdered jogger was found Search under way: State police crime investigators were on the scene close to Brooks Station Road in Princeton, MA, where the body of the murdered jogger was found He said: 'I haven't even had a shower or anything. I've been at the police station since 4 o'clock this morning.' He expressed gratitude to law enforcement saying: 'If you could understand what the State Police have told us there's not one negative note [about Vanessa]. 'They're going above and beyond what they have to to find this person. They've been in constant contact with us, the District Attorney, everybody, constantly. 'They've kept us in the loop and offered all sorts of assistance.' Meanwhile the small community of Princeton, MA, is trying to make sense of the act of violence that has shaken all who live there. Vanessa's body was found in woodland off Brooks Station Road, a picturesque and quiet stretch where locals often stroll or jog. Joanna Kay, manager of local meeting spot Mountainside Market Place Bakery and Café, explained: 'This is the sort of thing you think might happen in New York or a big city but not here. Homecoming: The 27-year-old was visiting with her mother (pictured right) in Princeton  'I walk that stretch of road every morning. Yesterday I walked it carrying Mace. This morning I didn't walk it at all. People are afraid.' Daily Mail Online has learned that a witness spotted Vanessa walking along Brooks Station Road around 1pm – police are focusing their investigation between the hours of 1pm when she left her mother's house and 4pm. According to the witness Vanessa was talking animatedly on her cell phone and appeared happy and engaged in her conversation. Her body was found in nearby woods by a K9 unit at 8.20pm. Authorities would not specify how she died but say her death appears to be a homicide. An autopsy is scheduled. Promising career: The Boston University graduate had worked as an account manager at Google in New York City for nearly two years Officials would not say how Marcotte died but mentioned a 'horrible set of facts' 'We have a horrible set of facts, horrible circumstance,' district attorney Joseph Early Jnr said on Monday. He added that it was unclear whether Marcotte's killing was a random act of violence and urged local residents to remain vigilant and exercise caution. 'People should be concerned,' Early told the press. Marcotte's employer, Google, said in a statement: 'Vanessa Marcotte was a much loved member of the Google team, working in our New York office for the last year and a half, and known for her ubiquitous smile, passion for volunteer work and love of Boston sports.  'We are deeply shocked and saddened, and our thoughts are with her family and friends'. Early said there was 'nothing at this point' connecting Marcotte's death to the unsolved slaying last week of Karina Vetrano, a female jogger in Queens.  Read more: Vanessa Marcotte found dead in Princeton; 'We don't know if this was a random act,' DA says | masslive.com Share or comment on this article e-mail 853 shares Most watched News videos Gruesome moment Korean chef dissects a LIVE octopus Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Teen films a burning 'meteorite' moving across sky in Japan Shocking moment man hits women in mass chicken shop fight Tidal surge filmed on Sunaoshi River in Tagajo, Japan Supermodel Gigi Hadid fights off man who grabs her at Milan show The moment a 7.4 magnitude earthquake hit Fukushima Kim Kardashian attacked in Paris by notorious prankster Mystery homeless woman in Rome avoids questions from reporter Cyclist films moment car causes him to crash then drives away Doorman knocks-out troublemaker during two-on-one confrontation 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob REVEALED: Number of Hamilton stars haven't voted in YEARS...

Browser manufacturers and many websites are doing everything in their power to send Flash packing as quickly as possible. Google today gave an update on the state of Flash depreciation in its popular Chrome browser. Luckily, things are proceeding swimmingly for those that can’t wait to be completely rid of the plugin. According to Google, 90 percent of Flash loads in the background to support operations like page analytics. However, starting with the release of Chrome 53 in September, Google will block this Flash activity by default. Google says that as web publishers move away from Flash to HTML5, users will see vast improvements in page load times and battery life. Not to mention, we should see a dramatic decrease in security exploits as Flash no longer finds an audience with consumers. However, the big change will come at the end of 2016 when Chrome 55 is released. Chrome 55 will see HTML5 enabled by default for all users (the lone exception is for websites that only support Flash). “For those, you’ll be prompted to enable Flash when you first visit the site,” wrote Google’s Anthony LaForge. “Aside from that, the only change you’ll notice is a safer and more power-efficient browsing experience.” In addition to putting the chokehold on Adobe Flash, Chrome 53 will also result in significant battery life improvements during video playback. A Google spokesman stated earlier this month, “By Chrome 53, we feel confident that we'll be at parity with other browsers in terms of power consumption for the majority of video playback on the internet." Mozilla will begin blocking flash in its Firefox browser this month, and click-to-play arrives in 2017.

First, the company unveiled a rich, searchable schedule and quick access to Olympics information through Search, then it began the Doodle Fruit games within the Google app. It’s also offering improved navigational features for those in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for the Games. Now, as the Olympics progress, you’ll also be able to look through the hottest trends using the search giant. Related: Photographer catches man wearing his stolen gear during Rio Olympics Google Trends now has an Olympic Hub for all Rio 2016 content that includes “fun facts, data insights, feature pages on sports and athletes, and more.” Fun facts are some of the first data you’ll see, such as “Fans want to know why swimmers wear two caps,” or “Alpine beach? Switzerland searches beach volleyball more than any other country.” These facts, which are paired with fun animations of a humanoid ball, are shareable, but the link just takes you to the main page with all of the “Olympic Moments.” “Throughout the next few weeks, Google Trends will give you a unique view into the Games with a new Trends Hub just for the Olympics. There, you’ll be able to see which athletes, events, and moments are captivating audiences — and searches — worldwide,” writes Lisa Creed, product manager at Google. Related: Inbox adds Google Drive integration, bundled emails from Trello, GitHub Below Moments are Featured Insights — these offer search interests on particular sports such as swimming and gymnastics in the past 24 hours. As you keep clicking, you’ll be able to get more specific search data on particular athletes, top questions about gymnastics, and even more fun facts and data. Under Featured Insights, you’ll find Trending Athletes and Trending Sports — you can break these down by interest over time and interest by region. There’s a lot of interactive visuals, data, and content to sift through in the Olympic Hub, and Google says even more is coming over the next few weeks. Also new is a visually updated Explore page within Google Trends that offers new ways to “analyze search data.” For example, just type in a search term like “ramen” and you will be able to see how search interest in the popular Japanese dish has grown since 2004 via a colorful chart.

Thank you for supporting the partners who make SitePoint possible. More from this author 9-Point Technical SEO Checklist for Developers Dropped in the Rankings? Diagnose, Minimize & Reverse the Damage Google Algorithms Explained, Pt. 2: Provide Better Answers If it’s not already, organic search traffic needs to be a priority for your digital marketing plan. More than half of traffic on the Internet comes from search engines (it could be as high as 60%). Organic search traffic is also hugely important in generating online sales. Of course, you realize your SEO is a priority — but where to start? All SEO starts with getting your website found, crawled and indexed by search engine robots. In this piece you’ll learn about the technical and on page aspects of SEO and how you can use them to attract the attention of Google, Bing and other search engines. Step 1: On Page SEO The first step to getting found by search engines is to create your pages in a way that makes it easy for them. Start off by figuring out who your website is targeting and decide what keywords your audience is using in order to find you. This will determine which keywords you want to rank for. Best practice is to target long-tail keywords as they account for the vast majority of search traffic, have less competition (making it easier to rank highly) and can indicate a searcher is in-market. They also have the added bonus of getting more clicks, having a higher click-through rate (CTR), and more conversions. There are quite a few free keyword research tools available out on the web. Once you have your target keywords, use them to build an optimized foundation for your pages. Put your keywords into these on page elements: Title tag: Title tags are one of the most important on page factors search engines look at when deciding on the relevance of a page. Keywords in the title tags tell search engines what it will find on the page. Keep your title tags 60 characters or less and use your most important keyword at the beginning. A correctly used title tag looks like this: <title>Page Title</title> Meta description: Meta descriptions by themselves don’t have much of an impact on the way search engines see your page. What they do influence is the way humans see your search snippet — the title, URL and description displayed in search results. A good meta description will get users to click on your site, increasing its CTR, which does have a major impact on your ranking. Keywords used in the descriptions appear in snippets in bold so, again, use yours here. Page Content: Obviously, you need to put your keywords in your page content. Don’t stuff your content though, just use your keyword 3-5 times throughout the page. Incorporate some synonyms and latent semantic indexing (LSI) keywords as well. Add a blog: Aside from the more stereotypical content marketing SEO benefits, blogs are crawling and indexing powerhouses for your site. Sites that have blogs get an average of: 97% more indexed links 55% more visitors 434% more indexed pages Adding and updating pages or content to your site encourages more frequent crawling by search engines. Step 2: Technical SEO Robots.txt After you’ve optimized your on page SEO factors for your target keywords, take on the technical aspects of getting Google to visit your page. Use a robots.txt file to help the search engine crawlers navigate your site. Very simply, a robots.txt file is a plain text file in the root directory of your website. It contains some code that dictates what user agents have access to what files. It usually looks something like this: User-agent:* Disallow: The first line, as you can probably guess, defines the user agent. In this case the * denotes all bots. Leaving the Disallow line blank gives bots access to the entire site. You can add multiple disallow lines to a single user-agent line, but you must make a separate disallow line for each URL. So if you want to block Googlebot from accessing multiple pages you need to add multiple disallows: User-agent: Googlebot Disallow: /tmp/ Disallow: /junk/ Disallow: /private/ Do this for each bot you want to block from those pages. You can also use the robots.txt file to keep bots from trying to crawl certain file types like PowerPoints or PDFs: User-agent:* Disallow: *.ppt$ Disallow: *.pdf$ To block all bots from your entire site, add a slash: User-agent:* Disallow: / It’s good practice to block all robots from accessing your entire site while you are building or redesigning it. Restore access to crawlers when your site goes live or it can’t be indexed. Also be sure that you haven’t blocked access to Schema.org markup or it won’t show up in Google’s rich search results. If you have a Google Search Console account, you can submit and test your file to the robots.txt Tester in the Crawl section. XML Sitemaps XML sitemaps are, like robots.txt files, text files stored in your site’s directory. This file contains a list of all your site’s URLs and a little extra information about each URL’s importance, last update, update frequency and if there are other versions of the page in a different language. The sitemap encourages search engines to crawl your pages more efficiently. Sitemaps include the following elements: <urlset> – The opening and closing line of the sitemap. It’s the current protocol standard. <url> – The parent tag for each URL in your site. Close it with </url> <loc> – This is the absolute URL where the page is located. It’s absolutely vital that you use absolute URLs consistently (http vs. https., wwww.example.com or example.com, etc.) <lastmod> – The date on which the page was last updated. Use YYYY-MM-DD format. <changefreq> – The frequency at which you make changes to the file. The more frequently you update a page, the more often it will be crawled. Search engines can tell when you’re lying, though, so if you don’t change it as frequently as you set here, they will ignore it. <priority> – A page’s importance within the site, ranging from 0.1 to 1.0. <xhtml:link> – This provides information about alternate versions of the page. When properly implemented, your sitemap should look like this: If you have a large or complicated site, or don’t want to make a sitemap yourself, there are lots of tools out there who can help you generate your XML sitemap. Sitemaps won’t really help you rank better, at least not directly. But they help search engines find your site and all your URLs, and that makes it easier for you to climb the rankings. Speed this process up even more by submitting your sitemap directly through Google Search Console. Go to Sitemaps under Crawl, and click Add/Test Sitemap. You can do the same with Bing’s Webmaster Tools. Use these tools to check for any errors in your sitemap that could impede the indexing of your site. Step 3: Off Page SEO You can always take the direct route and submit your site’s URL directly to the search engines. Submitting your site to Google is simple: visit their page, enter your URL, complete the Captcha to prove you’re human and click Submit Request. You can also go through Search Console if you have an account. You can submit your site to Bing using their Webmaster Tools, which requires an account. Use crawl errors to find issues that might be blocking crawlers. Make it easier for search engine spiders to find your site by getting your URL out there. Put a link to your website in your social media pages. This won’t really help you rank better in search results, but Google does crawl and index social media pages, so it will still see your links. It’s extra important that you have a Google+ account so you can use the rel=”publisher” tag to get your company information to appear in Google’s rich snippets. If you’ve got a YouTube account, post a short video explaining the features of your new site and add a link in the video description. If you’re on Pinterest, pin a high-resolution screenshot with your URL and a description (remember to use your keywords in the description). This last part of off-page SEO can be a bit tricky: Submitting your URL to a Web directory. Web directories were once a common way for SEOs to generate easy backlinks for their sites. The issue, however, is that many of these sites had a lot of spam content and provided little value to users. So submitting your URL to several low quality directories could do more harm than good. Do a little bit of homework on blog directories to find directories with high authority. Some directories to consider are: DMOZ, one of the top web directories and Alltop, if you’ve got an RSS feed and a decent amount of content. Also check out trusted resources online for curated lists of credible directories. In Conclusion Getting found online is the end goal of your SEO. But before people can find you, the search engines need to first. You can always publish your site, sit back, relax and wait for them to come to you, but that won’t get you the best results. Use the methods listed above to improve the crawling and indexing of your pages so you can start ranking faster and build your audience.

According to a report from the San Jose Mercury News, Google's planned rollout of its Fiber broadband service in the Bay Area has hit a snag, as the Chocolate Factory is considering a change of course. The paper says local officials in both Palo Alto and Mountain View have been told that the installation of new fiber cable lines has been put on hold as Google examines a plan to instead go with a service that could rely more on wireless connections. Google brought on such a system earlier this year with its acquisition of Webpass, which already operates a limited service in parts of the San Francisco bay area. Meanwhile, another emerging ISP is making big promises of its own in hopes of getting more US cities to sign up. Wow Internet, Cable & Phone says [PDF] it will soon be upgrading its internet service to provide gigabit data speeds in five US cities by the end of the year. The rollout will begin in Huntsville and Auburn, Alabama; Evansville, Indiana; Knoxville, Tennessee; and Grosse Pointe Shores, Michigan, before being expanded to others markets. Wow says it operates its internet service in 20 different US markets, mostly in the midwest and southeastern parts of the country. Hopefully Wow can provide the speeds it advertises, otherwise the ISP might find itself in a situation similar to the one currently facing Comcast. The US cable giant has been challenged in court by Verizon for claiming its internet service to be the "fastest" in America for home users. Now, it appears the Better Business Bureau's National Advertising Division has sided against Comcast, telling the cable giant it should stop making those claims in its marketing campaigns. Comcast reportedly plans to appeal the ruling. ® Sponsored: The state of mobile security maturity Tips and corrections 6 Comments More from The Register Google enlists Microsoft VoIP partner to unseat Office 365+Skype RingCentral in the middle 25 Comments Hax0rs sow Discord by using VoIP service to sling malware at gamers Not even playtime's safe these days 7 Comments CEO of VoIP biz admits in court: It was all a $1.8bn Ponzi scheme Unsuspecting investors given full Brazilian from TelexFree scam operation Apple, AT&T, Verizon named in $7bn VoIP patent claim Patent-holding firm alleges two violations 33 Comments Level 3 goes to Level 0 for American VoIP peeps Network provider stumbles, drops voice traffic 8 Comments Level3 switch config blunder blamed for US-wide VoIP blackout Updated Network dropped calls because it was told to 13 Comments Whitepapers OpenStack brings agility to cloud platforms FICO needed an agile platform to provide its analytic cloud services to mid-sized businesses.

The Mountain View, California-based company announced that by the end of this year, Chrome will no longer display Flash content by default. The change is a long time coming, really. In June 2015, Google introduced “intelligent pausing” in Chrome, a feature that automatically halted the playback of content, including Flash animations, it deemed “inessential” — think advertisements and autoplay sidebar videos. In a blog post, Chrome software developer Tommy Li wrote that the feature dramatically sped up web browsing and “significantly [reduced] power consumption.” But the choice remained optional: paused content could be resumed with a mouse click. Related: Hacker group may be exploiting unpatched vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player Tuesday’s news, then, might be seen as a more drastic step in the company’s efforts to hasten Flash’s obsolescence. Starting in December with version 55, Chrome will make HTML5 — a lightweight, plugin-free alternative to Flash — the default experience. With the exception of websites “which only support Flash,” Adobe’s plugin will be entirely disabled — a change that Chrome team developer Anthony LaForge said will result in an “improvement in responsiveness and efficiency for many sites.” “Flash helped make the Web a rich, dynamic experience, and shaped the modern set of web standards,” wrote LaForge in a blog post. “We continue to work closely with Adobe to ensure that your web experience is as fast and secure as possible and to help the Web transition to HTML5. The Chrome team’s choice to “de-emphasize Flash” follows the YouTube team’s decision to do the same. In January 2015, it announced the video streaming platform would serve content via HTML5, rather than Flash, by default in Chrome and the newest releases of Internet Explorer, Safari, and Firefox. YouTube Engineering Manager Richard Leider sung HTML5’s praises in a blog post. “[HTML5’s] Adaptive Bitrate … [allows] us to quickly and seamlessly adjust resolution and bitrate in the face of changing network conditions,” he said. “HTML5 lets you take advantage of the open VP9 codec, which gives you higher-quality video resolution with an average bandwidth reduction [and] Encrypted Media Extensions … [enables] content providers like YouTube to use a single HTML5 video player across a wide range of platforms.” Related: Firefox will begin blocking specific, unnecessary Flash content, starting in August Those comments echo others made by Firefox developer Mozilla’s Benjamin Smedberg earlier this year. “Over the past few years, Firefox has implemented Web APIs to replace functionality that was formerly provided only by plugins,” he said. “This includes audio/video playback and streaming capabilities, clipboard integration, fast 2D and 3D graphics, WebSocket networking, and microphone/camera access. As websites have switched from Flash to other web technologies, the plugin crash rate in Firefox has dropped significantly.” Microsoft, not to be outdone by Google and Mozilla, rolled out an “autopause” feature of its own to recipients of the recent Windows 10 Anniversary Update. In the Microsoft Edge browser, Flash content “not central to the web page” like “animations or advertisements” now display in a paused state, which the company said has reduced power consumption and improved performance. “In modern browsers, web standards pioneered by Microsoft, Adobe, Google, Apple, Mozilla, and many others are now enabling sites to exceed those experiences without Flash and with improved performance and security,” said Microsoft’s John Hazen. “This transition to modern web standards has benefited users and developers alike.” Flash, which gained popularity in the late 1990s as a platform-agnostic means of delivering interactive content, has seen a prolonged depreciation in the decades that followed. The pace of its decline arguably quickened in 2010, when Apple Chief Executive Steve Jobs effectively banished Flash from the iPhone, iPad, and the Cupertino, California-based firm’s other mobile devices. Adobe built and maintained a Flash client for Android in response, but announced its cancellation — and the move of most of the company’s engineering staff to HTML5 alternatives — just over a year later, in 2011. Presumably, it saw the writing on the wall.

On Sunday night (local time) Vanessa Marcotte's body was reportedly found naked and burned in a woodland area near the house in Worcester County. Local police have classed the incident as a homicide and are investigating the possibility 27-year-old Ms Marcotte was sexually assaulted before being killed and set on fire. Google has paid tribute to Ms Marcotte, saying in a statement: "Vanessa Marcotte was a much loved member of the Google team, working in our New York office for the last year and a half, and known for her ubiquitous smile, passion for volunteer work and love of Boston sports. "We are deeply shocked and saddened, and our thoughts are with her family and friends." A police source told local media Ms Marcotte was found with burns on her hands, feet and part of her head. The Worcester County District Attorney said the circumstances of the death were 'horrific'. Police are searching for suspects and combing the area for evidence relating to the death. Newshub.

That may be rectified in the near future, according to leaked screenshots that show a feature that does just that called ‘Explore Interests.’ The screenshots, published by Android Police, show a Google Now card that prompts users to get updates on their interests. Inside that feature, users can choose from categories like TV, sports and people. Within those categories are more niche categories and specific cards. Cards are also displayed along the top by popularity in the user’s area — shown as an example in the screenshot is the ‘People’ section, with Donald Trump, Hilary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. Currently, Google Now shows users news based on data collected from a user’s history, like search history and location. Adjustments can be made using on/off toggles in settings, or tapping on the catered info to mark disinterest in that news or source. Unfortunately for those interested in the feature, a Google representative told TechCrunch that Explore Interests is currently an experiment the company is testing, so rollout may not take place for a while, if ever — though today’s internet buzz will likely confirm to the company just how much interest there is in such an option.

Nashville effort to help Google Fiber a model to follow, Brookings expert says Jamie McGee , jmcgee@tennessean.com 3:02 p.m. CDT August 10, 2016 Google Fiber (Photo: Submitted) A local effort to help expedite Google Fiber's internet service in Nashville was highlighted by a Brookings Institution expert, who has encouraged other cities to follow Nashville’s lead. The issue has gained traction in the past week as Metro Council began considering a new ordinance that would allow new internet providers to add utility pole lines without waiting on existing providers to adjust their placement. The current process can lead to months of delays if several providers occupy the same pole. Blair Levin, a senior fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based think tank, said given high costs of deployment, barriers of entry need to be adjusted so that new players have access to the internet industry. In addition to directing Gig.U, an initiative focused on expanding high-speed networks, Levin led the development of the Federal Communications Commission's National Broadband Plan. Cities “should carefully follow the pioneering efforts of Louisville and Nashville to enable more efficient pole access,” Levin wrote. “Moreover, to the extent they have jurisdiction, all cities should be exploring any methods that can lower the cost of deploying and operating future-proof broadband networks.” THE TENNESSEAN Google Fiber: Nashville rollout slowed by pole dispute If there are three other providers on a pole, the process takes about 180 days at a minimum and some poles will take as many as 11 months to make ready, Google said. The company needs to connect close to 90,000 poles in Nashville. The ordinance's passage "materially impacts our ability to move forward," Amol Naik, Google Fiber's Southeast head of external affairs, said in an interview last week. Tennessee's Economic & Development Department also highlighted  "one-touch make ready" ordinances, which is what is proposed by Metro Council members, as broadband-friendly policies designed to reduce deployment costs in its recent Broadband Initiative Summary. AT&T and Comcast are both opposed to the ordinance.  AT&T argues this issue falls under federal jurisdiction and cannot be changed at the city level. The ordinance also would violate contracts with unions because non-represented workers could be moving lines, the company said. AT&T has sued Louisville, Ky., where a similar ordinance has already passed. Levin pointed out that these ordinances would apply to all companies, not just Google Fiber and that existing providers have benefited from decades of monopoly power. If AT&T wins its lawsuit against Louisville, federal and state courts should take up the issue, he said. "Breaking free from the status quo requires both creative and viable economic models," Levin wrote. "Broadband operators are businesses, not charities. If communities do not work to lower barriers to entry and enable efficient builds, the necessary new investment simply will not happen."

Google Pauses Plans To Build Google Fiber In Their Own Backyard Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Google Pauses Plans To Build Google Fiber In Their Own Backyard Image courtesy of Discrete_Photography August 9, 2016 3:43 pm EST By Kate Cox@kcoxdc no tech in techville google fiber san jose silicon valley There’s a funny thing about silicon valley: the place in the country synonymous with high-tech, internet-based industry is not one of the places with the fanciest, most modern broadband networks. And now it’s going to have to wait even longer to get its turn. As The Mercury News, a San Jose-area paper, reports, Google’s tentative plans to build out Fiber in the area have been put on hold for the time being. Google got the necessary permits from San Jose back in May, and so everyone expected the three-year construction project to begin in July. Instead, a hundred workers who were supposed to be doing the installation were told that the project was on delay, and offered transfers to another site. San Jose isn’t alone; Palo Alto and Mountain View (yes, where Google’s actual headquarters are) were also expecting to be working on the Fiber plan in the near future. Mountain View’s public works director told the Mercury News that Google’s announcement of a delay “was a surprise,” adding, “We didn’t expect it because we were working on what was their plan at the time.” So why the hold? Well, it turns out that a giant underground fiber project is both very complicated and very expensive. The original plan called for about 60% of the infrastructure to be underground, with 40% aerial (i.e. on poles). The new plan, however, may hinge on a recent Google acquisition: a company that specializes in high-speed wireless broadband using transmitters instead of (expensive, cumbersome) cables. Adding to the cost of digging is the fact that incumbent providers, including Comcast, Charter, and AT&T, work really hard to prevent Google from getting pole and right-of-way access in areas where they operate, when they can. For now, Google still lists San francisco as an upcoming Fiber city (at least, in part) and has San Jose on its “potential” city shortlist.

Wish you could spy on them legally to find out what they're planning? You can. Learn what your competition is up to with these tips.   Image source: Photospin.com Have you ever wished you could keep tabs on your competitors? That you could legally spy on the leading businesses in your field or area to find out how they are getting customers or why they are outselling you? The good news is that you can learn a lot about what your competitors are up to without doing anything illegal. Today's technology gives small business owners plenty of ways to learn how competing businesses drive business and sales. Set Google Email Alerts Find out when there is new information on the web about competing businesses, their employees or their products with Google Alerts. The alerts will make you aware of press releases, mentions, and new websites that have been found related to the alert terms you set up. Tip: To keep your email box from overflowing with alerts, be sure to read and follow the instructions and the tips in the links on the right side of the Google Alerts page. Follow Competitors on Social Media Find out about new products your competitor has in the works and when they'll release them by keeping track of their Twitter feed, Facebook, LinkedIn, Google+ and Instagram pages. If you know who some of the employees are,  see if those employees have profiles and pages on any of the social networks and follow those, too. In addition to learning what the companies you compete with are doing, pay attention to who follows them and mentions them in social media posts. Then see if you can make connections with some of their followers. Search for the Company Name Online Use Google, YouTube, Facebook, Bing, and Yahoo to search for the names of companies you want to keep tabs on and for the types of products or services they sell. Look at where those companies show up in the search listings and the descriptions that show up in the search results. Those descriptions may give you an indication of who their target market is or what the search engines think is important about their pages. Tip: Search as an anonymous user (or turn personal results off in Google). This will help prevent the search engines from guessing at what they think you want to see based on previous searches you've done. If you are keeping watch on local competitors, be sure to include a couple of location words in your searches.  Do some searches that include your city name, county or other geographical information followed by the product or service you sell.  If your competitors show up in search results for those terms, but your company doesn’t, take a close look at the pages the search engines link to on your competitor’s websites. (Hint: it may not be their home page.)  Look at what the focus of the page is, and what words are used on the page, whether their name, phone number and address are on the page, and what the percentage of text to images is. Then compare the results to your own website. If the company is using YouTube, look at their videos to see what they are promoting and who their target market appears to be.  Search for Their Key Employees Online If you know the names of the company principle or their key employees, plug those into your online searches. Doing so will help you find events they are speaking at, or have spoken at in the past, affiliations they havewith other companies, places they've posted or gotten publicity, and other details that will help you understand what your competitor is doing to get publicity, attention for their products and traffic to their stores and web pages. Your search may also turn up an employee leaking information about an upcoming product, or talking about the next area the company hopes to move into. Talk to Vendors and Customers A little networking with vendors and customers can bring you a gold mine of information if you're tactful and have established a good rapport with them. The key is to be a little chatty and to ask questions. When you're talking with vendors, see if they can give you suggestions about how other companies who buy from them are promoting products. If a customer calls and mentions a competitor, ask what they think about the competitor. Have they ever bought from them? Were they satisfied?  How does the customer think the competitors compare to you?    Attend Trade Shows and Local Seminars Listening to presentations made by your competitors and talking to other attendees and vendors at trade shows can help you pick up information you wouldn't get elsewhere. This can be a hit or miss strategy, so save it for trade shows that are local and inexpensive to attend, or that you plan to attend anyway. Rely on Automation and Web Scraping Tools SpyFu is a fee-based tool commonly used in conjunction with Google Adwords, but it's useful to uncover more information about your competitors' focus. The tool reveals which keywords companies purchase and what organic (ie, not paid) search terms place well on in search. Knowing that information will give you a better understanding of what terms and products are important to competing businesses. Then, you can make decisions as to whether changes are needed in your website, ads, or product literature to make your business more competitive. Join Local Business Networks If your business is local, joining one or several local business networks and attending their meetings regularly can help keep you on top of local competitors and new competitors coming into your neighborhood. These local business groups are your eyes and ears into the community at large. By becoming a regular attendee and a friendly (not pushy) networker, you may hear about new businesses moving into the area, planned local traffic changes, reasons people are happy or unhappy with one of your competitors and other things that will give you competitive and strategic information to help your business survive and thrive. © 2016 Attard Communications, Inc.

Google manager killed on jog was naked, had been burned The heartbroken father of a Manhattan-based Google manager who was killed after leaving for a jog near her parents’ home in Massachusetts demanded justice Tuesday, according to reports. “I could only ask for your prayers, that they find [who] did this. That’s all we want: Justice,” John Marcotte, father of Vanessa Marcotte, told the Boston Globe at his home on Tuesday. The devastated dad has been working tirelessly with cops, he told The Globe. “I haven’t even showered yet. I’ve been at the police station since 4 a.m.,” he said. He last saw his 27-year-old daughter — whose body was found naked and charred in the woods of Princeton, Mass. — at dinner Saturday, he said tearfully. “I went to eat with her at the Chop House Saturday night. After that, the next day, she was dead,” he said before weeping. He called his daughter bright and motivated said he wants the world to know how special she was. “I want my daughter remembered as a great kid. She’s the best kid in the world,” he said. “She was 100 percent on to her job. Her whole thing was to just get up the [career] ladder. She knew how smart she was,” he added. Vanessa Marcotte who worked as an account manager at the Google offices in Chelsea. She was visiting her parents in Princeton, MA when she left for a run at around 1 p.m. on Sunday, according to cops. Her corpse was found in the woods half a mile from her parents’ home seven hours later, police said. Police launched a statewide manhunt and opened a special tip line for information about the slaying on Tuesday, The Globe reported. “No tip is inconsequential or irrelevant; no matter what it is, please call the tip line, because it may be valuable to investigators seeking justice for Ms. Marcotte,” Massachusetts State Police said in a statement. Friends and family will celebrate her life at a vigil at First Congregational Church in Princetonon Tuesday night.

John Marcotte, 64, has described his torment over his only child’s death and has appealed to the public to help catch her killer. 10 The 27-year-old was missing for seven hours before she was found by cops John said: “How can anything ever be alright again when your only child has been horribly murdered?” “I ask people to pray that whoever did this is caught. She was the best kid in the world. Graduated top of her class,” he added. Vanessa Marcotte was last seen at 1pm on Sunday in Princeton, Massachusetts when she went for a run. Cops with sniffer dogs found her body at 8.20pm the same day about half a mile from her mum’s house in what they described as a “horrible set of circumstances”. The 27-year-old was discovered with burns on her hands and feet and police were investigating a sexual assault. Massachusetts State Police have now launched a homicide investigation and currently do not know if it was a random attack or not. related stories jogging murder horror Google manager, 27, is stripped naked, raped, killed and set on FIRE while running in woods near her mum's home 'I'VE GOT AN IDEA' Murder accused giggled at suggestion of 'macabre' test run for killing of love rival, a court is told MANHUNT FOR ESCAPED PRISONER Thug serving life for murder bid is on the run after absconding from an open prison DO YOU KNOW THIS MAN?

She graduated top of her class. She knew how smart she was.” Speaking to the Mail Online he expressed his gratitude to law enforcement saying: “If you could understand what the State Police have told us there’s not one negative note [about Vanessa]. “They’re going above and beyond what they have to to find this person. They’ve been in constant contact with us, the District Attorney, everybody, constantly. “They’ve kept us in the loop and offered all sorts of assistance.” Princeton Police Chief Michelle Powers said, “We are concerned about the safety of our town residents and the visitors that enter our town. “We would ask people to pay attention to their surroundings. “If you see anything suspicious or out of place, please contact the Princeton Police Department or the Massachusetts State Police. Getty Images 10 State Police searched the woods for the body of Marcotte after she disappeared Instagram 10 Marcotte was found in what officials described as a ‘horrible set of circumstances’ Getty Images 10 Worcester County district attorney Joseph D. Early Jr., spoke to the media “If you’ve seen anything in the past 24 hours that appeared suspicious or out of the ordinary, please contact us.” Marcotte worked for Google in New York City having graduated from Boston University in 2011. Spokesman for the university Colin Riley told F0X25: “We’re so terribly sad for her family and friends. They’re in our thoughts and prayers.” She had worked for Google for nearly two years and her employer released a statement saying: “Vanessa Marcotte was a much loved member of the Google team, working in our New York office for the last year and a half, and known for her ubiquitous smile, passion for volunteer work and love of Boston sports. Linkedin 10 District Attorney Joseph Early said people in the area should be concerned Getty Images 10 ‘We are shocked and saddened’, cops say “We are deeply shocked and saddened, and our thoughts are with her family and friends.” Before she began working for the tech giant the 27-year-old worked in marketing for Vistaprint. Vistaprint said in a statement: “We are shocked and heartbroken to hear the news about Vanessa. “She was always incredibly friendly and positive, and her smart, creative and innovative approach to work made a huge impact here at Vistaprint. “She truly cared about those around her and always made an effort to forge strong relationships. “Our thoughts are with her family and friends during this difficult time.” Getty Images 10 A photo of Marcotte was shown to the press outside the police station after cops identified her body Getty Images 10 A trooper uses a knife to clear brush away as he walks through the woods as he searched for the missing Google worker Getty Images 10 State police search an area of the woods off Boylston Street in Princeton, USA While at university she wrote a blog in which she said: “I am a Public Relations major with an extreme interest in all things Internet-savvy. “To get a little technical, I am passionate about business strategies like SEO, Analytics and Inbound Marketing (just to name a few) and hope to develop these skills further and make them a focus in my future career.” The rural town of Princeton has about 3,500 residents and is 40 miles west of Boston. DA Early says Marcotte grew up in nearby Leominster. The news comes just days after a woman was murdered jogging through Queens in New York City. Karina Vetrano, 30, was found dead with her jogging pants pulled down to her knees after being reported missing by her retired-firefighter father when she didn’t return from her regular 5pm run. Early said in the press conference there was “nothing at this point” connecting the two deaths. Cops in New York are still investigating Vetrano’s murder which sparked arguments on social media about her choice of clothing.

A Grand Bargain to Make Tech Companies Trustworthy Pentagon's Digital Service Team Snags Google Veteran Pentagon Taps Google’s Eric Schmidt for New Innovation Brain Trust Share this on Facebook Tweet this on Twitter Share this on Google Plus Share this on LinkedIn Print this article Email this article Increase size A top Google executive who joined the U.S. Digital Service gave internet users on Tuesday a look into his job: bridging the technological gap between Silicon Valley and Washington.  Matt Cutts, head of Google's web spam team and pioneer of Google's family SafeSearch filter, took leave from the company in June to join the Pentagon branch of USDS.  USDS, a problem-solving team known for recruiting from commercial giants including Amazon and Oracle, celebrated its second year this week. The group was founded by members of an emergency tech squad, parachuted in to the federal government to repair HealthCare.gov's botched rollout. Now, it has satellite versions in many major federal entities including the departments of Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs. » Get the best federal technology news and ideas delivered right to your inbox. Sign up here. Despite much hype, USDS has garnered criticism from lawmakers after a watchdog report suggested members don't always communicate with agency chief information officers, and that they don't regularly document how they select projects, which are supposed to be the federal government's most pressing IT problems. Cutts answered a few user-submitted inquiries on question-and-answer site Quora about his work in the federal government. Here are a few takeaways:  1. Tech professionals still wear shorts to work, even if they’re embedded in the Pentagon. Federal employees wary of USDS and 18F, the General Services Administration’s digital consultancy that also recruits from the private sector, suggested the influx of young talent might cause a culture clash between career employees and Silicon Valley hotshots. In one answer, Cutts describes this dichotomy: “We’re physically located in the Pentagon, which is pretty wild for someone used to wearing shorts and a T-shirt to work. I still wear shorts and a T-shirt most days.” The Pentagon’s digital service team is about 15 to 16 people, including engineers, designers, project managers and “bureaucracy hackers,” Cutts wrote. He described himself as an “individual contributor,” who originally joined as a software engineer.  2. Idealism might be enough to get techies to join government.  Federal executives have worried that low government salaries might deter tech talent — especially millennials — from joining the public sector instead of higher-paying, hipper private-sector tech jobs. Asked why he joined the Pentagon’s Digital Service, Cutts answered: “I’m fundamentally an idealist, and the idea of trying to help appealed to me. A bunch of people that I respect and like were also doing it. My former team at Google was doing well. And I was at a place in my life where I could spend several months in D.C. The final nudge came at a conference earlier this year when I had dinner with Haley Van Dyck, an early member of the USDS. After talking to her, the question became: Why wouldn’t you do this?” Later, he added, “For tech folks, government now represents a third option besides industry and academia.” 3. Some USDS work involves weeks-long research deep-dives into specific topics, called “discovery sprints.” In one such sprint Cutts participated in, he traveled to Afghanistan to understand what specific problems employees faced there. In another, he examined the process by which government and military hire and provide clearances — especially in the aftermath of the recent hack exposing personal information from more than 20 million people who underwent government background checks. “Parts of that system and process are now being improved and parts are being replaced,” Cutts wrote. “The Defense Digital Service has been observing that process, and I’ve been helping around the edges with some of that." 4. Trendy technology doesn’t figure prominently in Digital Service work. Asked what role A.I. plays in his job, Cutts wrote: “The DDS is focused on things that we can do in the next few months. Artificial intelligence might affect a lot of topics in the coming years, but honestly there’s just so many basic, fundamental things that need work right now. Making sure that veterans can more easily apply for their benefits, for example. In the USDS, people are working on making it easier to renew or replace a green card. “ In a later question, Cutts listed a few concepts he thought could most improve government, including bug-bounty programs, vulnerability disclosure policies, running citizen-facing services in the cloud, DevOps and agile methodology, user-centered design and open source software. recommended for you Threatwatch Alert Thousands of cyber attacks occur each day See the latest threats ADD A COMMENT The Inimitable Effect of Standing on Productivity The Decision-Making Science of Effective Healthcare Life After the Big Bang Making Sense of Healthcare FROM OUR SPONSORS sponsored Get Smart.

A blue globe with black eyes peering out in every direction protrudes from a tall, metal frame harnessed to his back. The manager of digital services for the Nature Conservancy of Canada (NCC) was out for a purposeful stroll across the sand Monday at St. Peter’s Harbour. Toting a Google Trekker, Thomas was capturing images around NCC’s protected 25 hectares of fragile dunes, marshes and shorebird habitat. The backpack-mounted camera that takes 360-degree images every 2.5 seconds is being used by the Nature Conservancy of Canada to capture images and map 14 of its most spectacular landscapes across the country. “This is the first time that we’ve had Google Trekker here on Prince Edward Island, so it’s pretty exciting,’’ says Julie Vasseur, NCC’s program director in P.E.I. The exercise will result in online viewers being able to enjoy a virtual tour of the reserve in St. Peter’s Harbour. “So they can go on line and see the imagery of this beautiful beach and it kind of gives them an idea of why it is that we protect it,’’ explains Vasseur. “We protect it for its natural beauty and we protect it for habitat. And we protect it so people down the road – our future generations – are able to see it as well.’ Thomas is able to weigh plenty of positives in a job that has him hauling a heavy load. Providing the land is somewhat flat, walking is not much of a chore, he notes. “While you’ve got this weight on your back, you certainly have the opportunity to take in this beautiful landscape,’’ he adds. “How can you not pay attention to what you’re surrounded by when you’re walking  (and recording images)? It’s a good workout and it saves going to the gym.’’ Thomas also carted the Google Trekker to Murray Harbour on Monday to record images of an island owned by the Nature Conservancy of Canada as well as a few other islands. Once the images are collected, Google will take about one year to stitch the imagery together before it ends up online on the NCC website. No need to wait for the virtual tour, though, notes Vasseur. “We always encourage people to come see our properties,’’ she says. The Nature Conservancy of Canada is the nation’s leading land conservation organization, working to protect the country’s most important natural areas and the species they sustain. Since 1962, NCC and its partners have helped to protect more than 1.1 million hectares coast to coast. It has conserved 28,000 hectares in the Atlantic Provinces.

Featured Story: How to Root Android: Our Always-Updated Rooting Guide for Any Phone or Tablet Android Gadget Hacks: Unchaining Android to enable tomorrow's features today — WonderHowTo How To: Use Google Cardboard if Your Phone Doesn't Have a Gyroscope Dallas Thomas 3 months ago How to Use Google Cardboard if Your Phone Doesn't Have a Gyroscope Many midrange phones are being manufactured without a gyroscope sensor—the Moto X Play, third-generation Moto G, and several of Samsung's Galaxy Grand models, among others. It's not exactly an essential smartphone sensor, and leaving this out keeps the phone's price point down, so it's an understandable omission. But most Google Cardboard apps refuse to run if your phone does not have a gyroscope. And it's not just Google Cardboard apps—several other fun features, like the Photo Sphere mode in Google Camera, rely on a gyroscope as well. Don't Miss: How to Cheat at Pokémon GO Without Getting Banned So developer Frazew created an Xposed module that uses the other sensors in your device to simulate gyroscope data. It combines the readings from your compass and accelerometer to create a virtual gyroscope of sorts, then fools apps into thinking that this data is coming from a real gyroscope sensor. Once installed, it's a seamless experience, so we can finally enjoy mobile VR with a device that doesn't support it natively. One quick thing to mention: this module does not yet work for tricking AR (augmented reality) mode in Pokémon GO, but the devs are working hard on figuring out a solution, so stay tuned. Requirements rooted Android device Xposed Framework installed "Unknown sources" enabled Step 1: Install VirtualSensor To start, head to the Download section in your Xposed Installer app and search for VirtualSensor, then tap the top result. From here, swipe over to the Versions tab, then hit the "Download" button next to the most recent entry. Within a few seconds, Android's installer interface should come up, so tap "Install" on this screen. When that's finished, make sure to activate the module and reboot, then you'll be all set to try some Google Cardboard apps or other apps you've been wanting to use that need a gyroscope. Step 2: Use Google Cardboard or Other Gyro-Based Features When you get back up, no further setup is needed—from now on, the vast majority of apps will simply think your phone has a gyroscope. One minor downside is that the simulated gyroscope data can lead to a little shakiness on occasion, but most VR apps will work just fine. If you'd like, you can open the VirtualSensor app from your app drawer to see a live feed of the data being simulated, which is pretty interesting. However, the first thing you'll probably want to do is install some Cardboard-compatible apps to test out the new functionality. For a good starting point on that, check out the link below for a list of our favorite Google Cardboard apps. Don't Miss: 10 Virtual Reality Apps to Get You Started with Google Cardboard Google's "Cardboard" app running without issue. If you don't have a Google Cardboard headset, or other VR headset, you can test out your newfound gyroscope properties by taking a Photo Sphere with your Google Camera, or by playing any video game from the Play Store with gyroscopic features.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search Skip to Navigation Skip to Main Content Skip to Related Content 0 Mail News Home Follow Us US World Politics Tech Science Odd News ABC News Yahoo Originals Katie Couric Matt Bai Why Is the Biggest Name in Self-Driving Cars Leaving Google? The AtlanticAugust 9, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share In the rapidly growing world of self-driving vehicles, Google is a clear leader. And Chris Urmson has been the human face of the company’s Self-Driving Car Project since it launched back in 2009. So it’s big news that Urmson is leaving Google, a move he announced over the weekend in a blog post. It’s also, so far, a big mystery as to what that means—for Urmson, for Google, and for any of its competitors. The biggest question is: Was he poached? Uber, famously greedy for autonomous-car talent, has recently announced several expansions to its own self-driving car ambitions—including testing driverless vehicles on public roads in Pittsburgh, and a new mapping effort in Mexico. Uber also has a track record of scooping up Google’s best. It hired the software designer Brian McClendon, previously one of Google’s most high-profile executives, to head its maps division last year. Recommended: Trump's Second Amendment Comment Cannot Be Excused Urmson makes it seem like his next plans are uncertain: “If I can find another project that turns into an obsession and becomes something more, I will consider myself twice lucky.” But Silicon Valley’s tech giants are famously secretive, especially in the realm of driverless cars. It wouldn’t be shocking, for instance, if Urmson wound up at Apple. What Urmson chooses next, and what happens to Google in his absence, remains to be seen. Little is known about Apple’s work on self-driving cars, though reports of mysterious middle-of-the-night work makes it sound like a Willy Wonka-run shop. The company has been ultra-cagey about discussing its ambitions for autonomous driving, though public records—including a patent filing revealed this week—offer some clues. “There is a joke in the Bay Area that if you know somebody in the vehicle space and they left their old job but they haven’t updated their LinkedIn, they must be at Apple,” Chris Gerdes, a professor of mechanical engineering at Stanford University, told me last fall. And there are other clues that Apple continues to ramp up its efforts on autonomous driving, like recently reassigning one of its most influential executives, Bob Mansfield, so that he can focus on the project, according to The Wall Street Journal. Then again, as one roboticist pointed out to me, many tech companies try to prevent people from company-hopping this way. “He likely has a non-compete clause for at least one (but probably more) years,” Missy Cummings, the head roboticist at Duke told me in an email. “I bet he pops up in a related field like drones or some other robotic field.” Recommended: The Audacious Plan to Save This Man’s Life by Transplanting His Head Adding more intrigue to Urmson’s departure are reports that he isn’t the only one leaving Google. John Markoff, writing for The New York Times, characterizes Urmson as “the latest in a string of departures by important technologists working on the autonomous car project.” Markoff also points out that the staffing changes come after Google hired John Krafcik, who was previously a chief executive at Hyundai America, to lead the car project as it spins out as its own company under the larger umbrella of Google’s new(ish) company, Alphabet. So maybe this is just one of those moments where a company is changing enough to prompt some of its big names to move on. That’s not unheard of—and Urmson did write that he is “ready for a fresh challenge”—but his departure still raises questions about how the Self-Driving Car Project will fare without him. Several people who have either worked directly with Urmson, or closely followed his work at Google, declined to speculate on what’s next, but underscored how important his contributions to Google have been. “His departure is certainly a loss for the project,” Mark Bergen and Johanna Bhuiyan wrote for Recode. “Urmson was the main engineer who built the code running Google’s autonomous software, according to one person who worked with the team.” Urmson didn’t immediately respond to my request for comment on Monday. “I have every confidence that the mission is in capable hands,” he wrote in his blog post. “There are many other problems or products this talented group of people could work on, but they’ve chosen self-driving cars because they understand the impact their work can have on making our roads safer and bringing everyday destinations within reach for millions of people.” What Urmson chooses next, and what happens to Google in his absence, remains to be seen.

Amy Gesenhues on August 9, 2016 at 11:56 am More According to TechCrunch, Google is testing a new “Explore Interests” feature for Google Now that will make it easier for users to control the information displayed via the mobile assistant app — as well as information a user may not want tracked. “It will give users more control over what sort of information Google will track on your behalf, and will make it easier to tell Google exactly what sort of information you want to hear more about,” writes TechCrunch reporter Sarah Perez, noting the feature was first reported yesterday by the Android Police blog. The Android Police story included screen shots of the new feature, showing six categories — sports, TV, movies, musicians, people and stocks — where users can select specific topics they are interested in seeing. The Android Police blog says each category listed in the “Explore Interests” feature includes several topics that can be tracked: “Each of these have different things that can be added, meaning if anything happens to that specific interest, it will pop up in Google Now as a new card.” Image credit: Android Police.

Here is a screen shot showing you how the Insights section plots that data: Plus, Google will show you how users found your listing — either through a direct click or search, which they call “discovery.” Direct is when a customer finds your listing searching for your business name or address.

Greg Finn on August 9, 2016 at 4:03 pm More Fan of Google’s Remarketing lists for search ads (aka RLSAs)? Good news, the popular retargeting option is now available for Google Search Partners. RLSAs allow marketers to customize their search campaigns to people who have previously visited their site. This targeting can allow advertisers to leverage non-traditional keywords by hitting a specific Audience familiar with the brand. To turn this feature on, head to the campaign settings tab, and be sure to click on “Include search partners”: Once it’s turned on, you’ll cast a wider retargeting net, potentially reaching out across the entire Search Network.

SUBSCRIBE Yelp, TripAdvisor: Google’s mobile ‘best-of lists’ hide our content Google is adding content for users on the go, but some local search rivals see the move intentionally marginalizing their content. Greg Sterling on August 9, 2016 at 4:08 pm More Last week, Google announced local “best-of lists” content will start to show in its mobile app search results. On August 4, the company posted, “Starting today in the US, when you search on your Google app for the best spots to eat and drink, you’ll have access to reviews from top critics and best-of lists from reputable publishers.” The idea is to offer more local search content to mobile users on the go. Below is an example of what it looks like. However, Google’s rivals don’t think this improves the user experience. They see it as anticompetitive. Recode captured tweets from Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman and TripAdvisor CEO Stephen Kaufer that were highly critical of the move. Stoppelman tweeted that “Google monopolist not satisfied with above the fold they’ve now claimed “‘page 2.'” Google monopolist not satisfied with above the fold they’ve now claimed “page 2” cc @kaufer#byeorganicpic.twitter.com/qGXmt2Z5K5 — Jeremy Stoppelman (@jeremys) August 5, 2016 Asked for a comment today, a Yelp spokesperson responded, “This is just yet another example of Google finding ways to preference its house-owned properties (here, Zagat) since they don’t perform/score well organically.” Similar complaints are at the center of the “search bias” antitrust complaint in Europe — Google “favoring its own content” at the expense of third party publishers. Google denies this claim and takes the position that its actions are about improving the user experience, not about suppressing or marginalizing others’ content. There’s a great deal at stake in this debate, given that something approaching 60 percent of search queries now happen on mobile devices.

 Google just put the nail in Adobe Flash's coffin Kif Leswing Aug. 9, 2016, 4:21 PM 8,683 facebook linkedin twitter email print Getty Google is finishing what Steve Jobs started six years ago. It will "de-emphasize" Adobe Flash in its Chrome browser, the company announced on Tuesday. By December, Adobe Flash will no longer be turned on by default in Chrome, which is used by 50% of people on desktop, according to estimates. In fact, Google Chrome will block most instances of Adobe Flash by September. Instead, Chrome will use by default HTML5, a more modern standard that can save battery life on laptops. Google posted this on its Chrome blog: "Today, more than 90% of Flash on the web loads behind the scenes to support things like page analytics. This kind of Flash slows you down, and starting this September, Chrome 53 will begin to block it. HTML5 is much lighter and faster, and publishers are switching over to speed up page loading and save you more battery life. You'll see an improvement in responsiveness and efficiency for many sites." If a site supports only Flash, then Google says that users will have an option to enable Flash when they first visit the website. In the early days of the internet, Flash was one of the few ways to build rich experiences on the web — so it was commonly used for videos, games, or even interactive navigation. But Apple decided not to support Flash on the first iPhone, starting its long downfall as a web standard, and then CEO Jobs gave the company's reasons for, in his words, "leaving the past behind." According to Jobs in 2010, there were six reasons why Apple chose not to support Flash on the iPhone: Adobe Flash is proprietary. Newer video formats are superior and widely available. Flash is insecure and does not perform well. Flash kills battery life. Flash does not support touch. Apple did not want developers writing Flash apps instead of iPhone apps. For years, Google has signaled that it agrees that Flash is an antiquated format that must die, and now it looks like it's finishing the job.

Researchers find anyone can create an Android app for just $25 to access sensors and track your every move  Created algorithm that attaches to phone's sensors without permission Team was then able to 'see' the users' exact paths in graphs of real roads  Researchers checked results against OpenStreetMap for accuracy By Stacy Liberatore For Dailymail.com Published: 15:07 EST, 9 August 2016 | Updated: 15:16 EST, 9 August 2016 e-mail 145 shares 11 View comments Technology has opened us up to a new world of information, but it has also opened up doors for cyber-thieves. Researchers found that hackers can easily manipulate Android apps to track a user's location and traffic patterns without their knowledge or consent - and these apps launch in Google Play for just $25. The team developed an algorithm for their own Android app, which inserted data from the phone's built-in sensors into graphs of real world roads, allowing them to 'see' users' exact paths. Scroll down for video  Researchers found that hackers can easily manipulate Android apps to track a user's location and traffic patterns without their knowledge or consent – which can be launched in Google Play for just $25  HOW DID RESEARCHES CONDUCT THE STUDY?  Researcher at Northeastern University developed their own app to show just how easy it is for these data pirates to trail users. The algorithm isn't using anything proprietary, instead, it checks against OpenStreetMap, a free and collaborative public database of maps and roads, reportsThe Daily Dot. The app's algorithm attaches to a smartphone's accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer without being granted permission by the user. During first portion of experiments, Noubir and his colleagues simulated drivers in 11 cities around the world including Berlin, London, Rome, Boston and Atlanta.  The second was done through real road trips, which the researchers traveled 1,000 over more than 70 different routes across Boston and Waltham, Massachusetts. Scores of measurements from the phones' positions, which includes angles of turns and the trajectory of curves, for both tests were then collected once the driving was completed. When an Android app wants to access sensitive information on a smartphone, such as accessing the GPS or Wi-Fi, it usually has to notify users before proceeding with the process. However, some app creators place permission for this kind of access deep within the terms-of-use that users skip over.  Android apps are able to access key sensors linked to location, movement and orientation, without being given the go-ahead. Researcher at Northeastern University developed their own app to show just how easy it is for data pirates to trail users. According to Gue­vara Noubir, pro­fessor in the Col­lege of Com­puter and Infor­ma­tion Sci­ence, the algorithm isn't using anything proprietary, instead, it checks against OpenStreetMap, a free and collaborative public database of maps and roads, reports The Daily Dot. The app's algorithm attaches to a smartphone's accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer without being granted permission by the user. 'In our research we show that an app in fact does not need your GPS or Wi-​​Fi to track you,' says Noubir. 'Just using these sen­sors, which do not require per­mis­sions, we can infer where you live, where you have been, where you are going.' To test the system's accuracy, the team conducted two separate studies. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Hackers create 'Eye of Sauron'-inspired malware to spy on...

The second was done through real road trips, which the researchers traveled 1,000 kilometers over more than 70 different routes across Boston and Waltham, Massachusetts. Using an algorithm, the team inserted data from the phone's built-in sensors into graphs of real world roads, allowing them to 'see' users' exact paths. During first portion of experiments, researches simulated drivers in 11 cities including Berlin, London, Rome, Boston and Atlanta SECURITY FLAW IN 900 MILLION ANDROID DEVICES COULD LET HACKERS RUN WILD  Owners of Android phones have been warned of a serious security flaw that could give attackers complete access to a phone's data. The problem has been identified in software used in about 900 million Android phones, including the HTC One, and Sony Xperia Z Ultra. While there is currently no evidence of the flaws being used by hackers, experts say it is a race as to who finds the bug first. The glitch was found by researchers from Checkpoint, who posted about it in a blog. The problem appears to affect phones which run on Qualcomm processors, which the blog estimates to be around 900 million devices. Checkpoint discovered the problem after spending six months reversing Qualcomm's code. They found that the problem lay in the software that handles graphics, and in the code that controls communication within the phone. While the patches – fixes for the bug – have been distributed to the phone makers, it is still unclear how many of those companies have sent the update to their customers. In the meantime, Checkpoint has created an app called 'QuadRooter Scanner', that allows users to check if their phone is vulnerable to the bug. Scores of measurements from the phones' positions, which includes angles of turns and the trajectory of curves, for both tests were then collected once the driving was completed. For each trip, the system then generated the five most likely paths taken and 50 percent of the time, one of the five paths generated by the algorithm was the correct route. 'Infer­ring a dri­ving pattern from an Android app can lead to much greater invasions of pri­vacy, such as where the user lives and works,' says Noubir. 'Addi­tional infor­ma­tion can then be gleaned by searching town and city public data­bases for, say, prop­erty tax records.' 'Adver­saries can recover lots of details through these side channels.' Noubir suggests the best way to protect yourselves is to investigate apps before installing them and skips those that aren't familiar. The second was done through real road trips, which the researchers traveled 1,000 over more than 70 different routes across Boston and Waltham, Massachusetts.

Harley Tamplin for Metro.co.ukTuesday 9 Aug 2016 8:56 pm Where is Palestine? (Picture: Google) If you search for Palestine on Google Maps, you might be surprised to find that it is not marked on the widely-used mapping tool. More than 200,000 people have signed a petition calling on Google to add Palestine to Maps, with many believing it has been removed – and its land ‘taken over’ by Israel. Gay couple ‘made to feel like criminals’ after shopper complains about them holding hands The country’s ‘removal’ by Google has prompted a huge campaign, including the social media hashtags #PalestineExists and #Palestineishere, but there’s just one problem. Palestine has not been removed because it was never there in the first place. Due to its ongoing conflict with Israel, Palestine was not shown on Google Maps five months ago, when the petition – which has only picked up serious momentum recently – was created. More than 215,000 people have backed the petition (Picture: change.org) WHY DID GOOGLE TAKE PALESTINE OFF THE MAPS! #PalestineExists — WannabeJannati (@StuckInTheDunya) August 9, 2016 Google has deleted the name of Palestine from all its maps and replaced it with Israel.

Put @Palestine_UN back on the map #Palestineexists — Lola Kay (@MsLolaKay) August 9, 2016 Despite their misplaced anger, tens of thousands of people have flocked to sign the petition to add Palestine to Google Maps. The petition states that, in failing to recognise Palestine, ‘Google is making itself complicit in the Israeli government’s ethnic cleansing of Palestine’. The latest threat lurking in British waters? Seals that can ‘rip off a child’s arm’ Its description reads: ‘According to Google, Palestine does not exist. ‘The omission of Palestine is a grievous insult to the people of Palestine and undermines the efforts of the millions of people who are involved in the campaign to secure Palestinian independence and freedom from Israeli occupation and oppression. ‘This is an important issue, as Google Maps are now regarded as definitive by people around the world, including journalists, students and others carrying out research into the Israel-Palestine situation.’ MorePalestine Woman locked 14 cats in house until they got so hungry they ate each other Donald Trump could still be blocked from becoming president Transgender woman called for Domino's boycott after delivery man called her 'sir' Powerful images from HIV epidemic protests in the 1980s and 1990s Man with no arms refused for loan because he couldn't provide fingerprints Police shoot kangaroo dead right in front of a child MORE: Dad still makes things fun for kids, even though times are tough MORE: Pictures: Summer camps are a bit different on the Gaza strip MORE: Syrian refugee who sold pens to feed his kids now owns three businesses and employs asylum seekers Comments Must read What's trending nowMore trending stories » Argos is selling the new Apple Macbook for £100 - and we think someone's in trouble Man 'raped partner while she was in labour' Woman locked 14 cats in house until they got so hungry they ate each other Usage #524 for the new five pound note Toddler saves dad's life by force-feeding him Muller Crunch CornerMore trending stories » YOU ARE HERE: World › Palestine Home News Sport Lifestyle Entertainment More Blogs Jobs Search Metro Trending Nutshell MetroUK @MetroUK © 2016 Associated Newspapers Limited Powered by WordPress.com VIP Your ad choices Terms and ConditionsPrivacy PolicySite map Back to top Get us in your feed Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter

(AP Photo/John Locher) Share Written by Mike Murphy Obsession Machines with Brains August 09, 2016 Almost every videoconferencing system on the market seems to be difficult to set up, unreliable, or just a hassle to use. But a device described in a new Google patent might be able to do away with choppy video and awkward camera angles, and make it really feel like the faces of your coworkers are in the office with you. If you can put up with the buzzing. Google’s new patent, awarded today, outlines a type of small drone that’s been fitted with a screen, that could project a virtual version of someone as it hovers around the office. According to the patent, the drone could either be powered by a cellphone sitting in the drone to connect to the internet, or paired remotely with another device. The drone has a drop-down screen to protect images onto. (US Patent and Trademark Office) The drone appears to be a standard quadcopter-shaped drone, which would allow it to hover around as needed, and presumably be at the beck and call of its operator. This version appears to be powered by a smartphone. (US Patent and Trademark Office) Another version of the drone appears to use a projection camera attached right to the body of the drone to display an image below it, rather like an inverted version of the holograms in Star Wars. This version appears to just emit projections from above. (US Patent and Trademark Office) There’s no guarantee that Google, or its parent company, Alphabet, is working on something like this—this is just a patent after all. But the company’s ambitions in drone delivery are well documented, and it wouldn’t be too much of a stretch to think that its X research lab might be working on companion drones like this. (Alphabet wasn’t immediately available to comment on its plans for the patent.) There are already drones on the market, such as DJI’s Phantom 4, that are pretty good at avoiding humans and hovering around like this, and there are even videoconferencing bots, like the one that was used to reserve a place in line for the latest iPhone last year. But the bigger question is why someone would want this: Drones are loud, they have generally very short battery lives (shorter than your average meeting), and their propellors can very easily chop pieces off of you if you’re not careful. In the patent Google contends its idea would be easier to move around than a laptop: “Implementation of a mobile telepresence system on a relatively compact and operationally efficient airborne platform such as a quadcopter may provide significant improvements in, for example, speed, maneuverability, energy consumption and the like, facilitating access to spaces which may be otherwise difficult to access by a larger and less maneuverable platform.” But in reality, it might be simpler just to stick with the shoddy Skype connection.

Personally, I’ve been using it since I received my invite back in the day, and has turned into the only email app that I use just about anywhere. Inbox makes it easy to set reminders to come back to emails, keep track of any long conversations that are taking place, and maintain my “Inbox Zero” status. The latest update features a few changes that will not only improve your overall experience, but also help keep you more productive at the same time. With version 1.29, Google has now integrated Trello, GitHub and Google Alerts into Inbox. When subscribed to any specific projects, you will now receive emails in Inbox which will be organized accordingly along with with a brief summary of the changes. There is even an “Open in Trello” or “Open in GitHub” option, below the grouped emails, making it a breeze to pop into the necessary app and view what’s going on. With Google Alerts, you will now be able to view a breakdown of alerts and scan through them “just like a newsletter.” These alerts will appear at the top of your inbox and you can either get rid of them by deleting them, or open the alerts up to see what’s going on. This seems pretty similar to the latest update that was pushed to Google Now which allows you to add various topics and keep track of any news that pertains to your selected topics. Other changes: If you use Google Drive, you can now insert Drive links into emails, check and fix permissions for those links, and save email attachments to Drive. You can now drag-and-drop contacts between to, cc, and bcc in compose on web. You can delete right from the inbox just as easily as you can mark as done. The update is rolling out today, and you can download Inbox for free by clicking the link down below. Let us know what you think about Inbox and if it’s something that you can see as being useful.

Share this article Share 853 shares Members of the local fire service and police stood guard outside the white clapboard church allowing those close to the family and those simply moved to attend 'space' to grieve and pray together. The congregation, several hundred strong, filled the church and its gallery, singing hymns and offering silent prayers. According to Pastor Michel the town has had its share of strife and sorrow 'but no hour has been more sorrowful than this.' Some wept as they held candles aloft and Pastor Michel urged them to reach out to Vanessa's family in letter and by telephone. Earlier, Daily Mail Online spoke with Vanessa's father, John, outside his home in nearby Leominster, where Vanessa was raised. He spoke of his torment over his only child's death and appealed to the public to help catch her killer. John, 64, said: 'How can anything ever be all right again when your only child has been horribly murdered?' Volunteer fire department personnel stand outside the church during the vigil for Vanessa Marcotte Vigil: The congregation, several hundred strong, filled the church and its gallery He said: 'I'd ask people to pray that whoever did this is caught. She was the best kid in the world. Graduated top of her class.'  Google account manager Vanessa, 27, lived in New York and was home visiting her mother, Rossana, in nearby Princeton over the weekend. She went out for a jog on Sunday afternoon and never returned. A source told Fox25 in Boston that investigators were examining the possibility that Marcotte was sexually assaulted and set on fire, with burns to her hands, head and feet. Barely 24 hours earlier her father saw her for what would be the last time. He recalled: 'I was with her. We went out to eat at the Chop House on Saturday night. After that, the next day, she was dead.' Trembling with emotion Marcotte said that there was nobody in his daughter's life who would wish to harm her though he said that this was 'part of the investigation'. According to her father, Vanessa didn't have a serious boyfriend instead, he said: 'She was 100 per cent into her job. She graduated top of her class at BU. She knew how smart she was.' Marcotte explained that Vanessa had recently got a new manager at Google and was 'excited' about her future with the company she loved. Marcotte was returning home after being with law enforcement, he explained, since 4 o'clock this morning. State troopers move in: Massachusetts officers were searching woodland around the area where the Google executive's body was discovered on Sunday night Search under way: State police crime investigators were on the scene close to Brooks Station Road in Princeton, MA, where the body of the murdered jogger was found Search under way: State police crime investigators were on the scene close to Brooks Station Road in Princeton, MA, where the body of the murdered jogger was found He said: 'I haven't even had a shower or anything. I've been at the police station since 4 o'clock this morning.' He expressed gratitude to law enforcement saying: 'If you could understand what the State Police have told us there's not one negative note [about Vanessa]. 'They're going above and beyond what they have to to find this person. They've been in constant contact with us, the District Attorney, everybody, constantly. 'They've kept us in the loop and offered all sorts of assistance.' Meanwhile the small community of Princeton, MA, is trying to make sense of the act of violence that has shaken all who live there. Vanessa's body was found in woodland off Brooks Station Road, a picturesque and quiet stretch where locals often stroll or jog. Joanna Kay, manager of local meeting spot Mountainside Market Place Bakery and Café, explained: 'This is the sort of thing you think might happen in New York or a big city but not here. Homecoming: The 27-year-old was visiting with her mother (pictured right) in Princeton  'I walk that stretch of road every morning. Yesterday I walked it carrying Mace. This morning I didn't walk it at all. People are afraid.' Daily Mail Online has learned that a witness spotted Vanessa walking along Brooks Station Road around 1pm – police are focusing their investigation between the hours of 1pm when she left her mother's house and 4pm. According to the witness Vanessa was talking animatedly on her cell phone and appeared happy and engaged in her conversation. Her body was found in nearby woods by a K9 unit at 8.20pm. Authorities would not specify how she died but say her death appears to be a homicide. An autopsy is scheduled. Promising career: The Boston University graduate had worked as an account manager at Google in New York City for nearly two years Officials would not say how Marcotte died but mentioned a 'horrible set of facts' 'We have a horrible set of facts, horrible circumstance,' district attorney Joseph Early Jnr said on Monday. He added that it was unclear whether Marcotte's killing was a random act of violence and urged local residents to remain vigilant and exercise caution. 'People should be concerned,' Early told the press. Marcotte's employer, Google, said in a statement: 'Vanessa Marcotte was a much loved member of the Google team, working in our New York office for the last year and a half, and known for her ubiquitous smile, passion for volunteer work and love of Boston sports.  'We are deeply shocked and saddened, and our thoughts are with her family and friends'. Early said there was 'nothing at this point' connecting Marcotte's death to the unsolved slaying last week of Karina Vetrano, a female jogger in Queens.  Read more: Vanessa Marcotte found dead in Princeton; 'We don't know if this was a random act,' DA says | masslive.com Share or comment on this article e-mail 853 shares Most watched News videos Gruesome moment Korean chef dissects a LIVE octopus Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Teen films a burning 'meteorite' moving across sky in Japan Shocking moment man hits women in mass chicken shop fight Tidal surge filmed on Sunaoshi River in Tagajo, Japan Supermodel Gigi Hadid fights off man who grabs her at Milan show The moment a 7.4 magnitude earthquake hit Fukushima Kim Kardashian attacked in Paris by notorious prankster Mystery homeless woman in Rome avoids questions from reporter Cyclist films moment car causes him to crash then drives away Doorman knocks-out troublemaker during two-on-one confrontation 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob REVEALED: Number of Hamilton stars haven't voted in YEARS...

So, when a product comes along to threaten that major revenue stream, it has to find ways to combat it. That’s seemingly what it’s done with AdBlock Plus, a relatively well-known Chrome extension used to block out ads across the internet. This includes the ads shown before and during video playback on YouTube… Normally, long advertisements give users the option to skip after five seconds or so. With Google’s fix on YouTube in Chrome, that option no longer appears. As reported by NeoWin, it seems Google has found a way to make the ‘skip ad’ option invisible to users with AdBlock installed. In short: It’s essentially forcing users to watch entire advertisements before YouTube videos. It’s worth noting, Google’s workaround isn’t exclusive to AdBlock, but all similar extensions used to blocked ads on YouTube. Essentially, Google has altered the programming to make ad-blockers see the ‘Skip’ option as the ad, removing that instead of the actual commercial. It’s pretty clever, but has clearly upset a number of ad-haters. [twitter https://twitter.com/r4rev2/status/640724992930500608 align=’center’] [twitter https://twitter.com/SteeScribbles/status/640587426067521536 align=’center’] The only way to stop this from happening is by either uninstalling the ad-blocking extension or by whitelisting YouTube within the extension’s settings. Either way, AdBlock just became a little less useful to those looking to banish all forms of advertising from their digital screens. This story is just one of a growing number of those showing the current uncertainty surrounding the world of online media. With ad revenue dropping, and more people blocking advertisements out completely, both content creators and the ad hosts are having to come up with new ways to sustain revenue. This is just one seemingly simple trick from Google to help the cause, and it probably won’t be the last time we hear of the king-of-ads working to bypass and neutralize the effect of ad blockers. Guides Google View THe Guide YouTube View THe Guide Chrome View THe Guide https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/1099657746731751/ Vignesh Rangaraj Wait there are ads on YouTube?!?! http://aaskdlfjasldf.wordpress.com aaskdlfjasldf Well, Google’s tactics doesn’t work for Adblock plus. I haven’t ever seen an ad on Youtube with Adblock plus and Chrome. No Youtube red ads either. Resistance is futile. https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/10153692355602009/ Karen Ng It would be nice to have a reasonable subscription option not to have ads instead of disabling the ad blocking software. Users understand that it costs the creators to make and Google to host the videos. http://www.facebook.com/100001833789349 Lutz Herkner Understandable, too. In the US YouTube has already an option to see videos for a small fee, say 50ct. But I don’t know how long it takes to go through the payment process. Meaning: if this is really usable. But I’ve never heard that Google thinks of having a flat like 9.99/month to have all vids on YouTube available … and I’m not sure if there would be a significant number of people who’d pay that. But all discussion is useless: Google always does what Google wants … ;)) http://twitter.com/BeeBooque BeeBooque (@BeeBooque) ‘YouTube Red’ Ad-Free Subscription Service Launches in U.S. October 28 “Google today announced YouTube Red, a new subscription service that provides unlimited ad-free access to YouTube videos for $9.99 per month on Android, desktop and the mobile web” Man, are you from future ? http://www.facebook.com/100001833789349 Lutz Herkner You should think of the guys who make these videos: it’s not only Google who makes money with ads, but the creators, too. And in some cases (like me) they life from that! So instead of moaning about 30 seconds of an ad you can’t skip, be aware that there has someone spent 30 minutes or 30 hours to create that video. Wouldn’t it be fair to grant this creator 30 seconds (most preroll ads are shorter than that!) in exchange? Seems still a good deal for me … http://www.ringdigital.tv RingDigital.tv Sadly, consumers don’t seem to see it this way. Ever. The music business struggled with this in the 1999 Napster era and in that case there is absolutely no justification for stealing music. But consumers felt it should be free and devalued it as such. With media, the “agreement” between media producer and viewer is even less explicit – so consumers are 100% focused on the data cost and slow loading pages and terrible UX of ads popping up everywhere. They see none of the connection that you outline above and in fact since there’s a supply glut of content, they can also argue that in fact we don’t need all the content we have today. I’m not arguing this, I’m just saying consumers might think it. https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/10205785424820821/ Kevin Wolf Personally, I don’t mind supporting the creators or even the host, in this case. They exist to make content (the creators) and to make money (youtube/google), and I can’t fault them for that because without both of them, it would be a lot harder to find quality recordings of cats playing the keyboard. However, if a small part of a useful product is annoying, the consumer will find a way to bypass the annoying part to get to the useful part because they WANT to use that service, but don’t like the intrusiveness of clownshoes.com forcing their way into it. The ad creators (emphasis on “ad”) and hosts invite things like adblock when the consumer is just trying to look at a video of some dude farting on a snare drum and there’s an unskippable 30-second Buick ad blaring at 10x the volume of everything else that they’re doing at the time. I’m not saying that AdBlock is the morally correct thing to do, or that AdBlock is morally wrong, I’m just saying that a bunch of irritating asshats spoiled it for everyone, just like they spoil most things. It’s a “rock and hard place” situation for some (like me), but I also admit that the people who just want free shit handed to them on a platter vastly outnumber the people that stop and think about content creators (see 98% of popular torrent site users). https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/10156036635530052/ Rashed Hiyasat Chrome has crashed on my device, and i had to use Edge – no adblocks, and i was horrified when browsing the internet , it is an ugly annoying place without the ad blockers, i could not use Youtube. so if they force them down my throat i will most definitely stop going to the site. http://twitter.com/fjalfredo Frederick (@fjalfredo) I hate ads as much as the next guy, when they slow down my web to a crawl. However, I see them as my way of “paying” for my free content, so I accept them. In your case, if you think about it, You Tube will not miss you one bit. If you block their ads, then You Tube does not make money from you. They will not miss you if you go, since you were never a paying customer to begin with. In fact, they will save money if you dont visit YouTube because your video habit is costing them money because they have to serve you those videos. https://www.facebook.com/app_scoped_user_id/10207160349800115/ Eric Oathes How about letting us pay a subscription fee rather than forfeit our free time watching ads? http://www.facebook.com/507686626 Paul Andrew Dixon I honestly could not care less if google make money from advert — instead what they do is annoy people and make people avoid them… the most annoying thing is that the ads are often not relevant to the video, they appear at stupid times and block the video, they interrupt the video mid sentence… Ads should be clever and integrated correctly to be affected – instead it’s more “just fill the space with ads…any chance of popping up mid video…heck just stop the video and play an ad — im sure everyone will love ads and it will make them stop watching to click on the ad” http://twitter.com/carstorm Anthony Stepka (@carstorm) Using ublock origin I’m un-effected. It seems like a simple code change to the extension would fix the problem anyways so what has Google done, got peop[el to view ads for an hour, a day at most?

Such a move is a big win for Google’s burgeoning cloud enterprise business. Past reports claim that Apple’s iCloud is powered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. Apple is reportedly paying Google between $400 million and $600 million for the deal. While Apple is not dropping Amazon entirely, they are presumably cutting back their dependence in order to save costs. Google is third in the enterprise cloud business, but recently hired former VMWare co-founder Dianne Greene to lead and grow their cloud business. The company has big plans to make have their cloud business more profitable than their current ads business within five years. Since her appointment, Greene has been “aggressively forming partnerships and swinging deals to bring in large enterprise customers,” the CRN report says. Google has at least one advantage compared to competitors due to its extensive fiber networks that connect their data centers and help lowers bandwidth costs. Just last month, Spotify also announced they will be using Google’s Cloud Platform to power their music backend. According to Amir Efrati of The Information, it will take a year for iCloud to be fully running on the Google Cloud Platform and it is unlikely to be very profitable for Google, as it was not for Amazon. However, it is a symbolic victory that shows Google is making headway into the enterprise cloud business. It’s true, @iCloud to be partially powered by @googlecloud. But will take a year & unlikely to be profitable. @awscloud lost $ from iCloud. — Amir Efrati (@amir) March 16, 2016 Guides Amazon View THe Guide Apple View THe Guide cloud View THe Guide http://thebestoftheinternets.wordpress.com thebestoftheinternets HA! I thought Apple and Google were mortal enemies. Remember when Steve Jobs said: “I will spend my last dying breath if I need to, and I will spend every penny of Apple’s $40 billion in the bank, to right this wrong,” Jobs said. “I’m going to destroy Android, because it’s a stolen product. I’m willing to go thermonuclear war on this.” Now Apple is paying Google $400 million and $600 million for a deal to power iCloud? Is Apple surrendering on the installment plan?

With this update, if Android users want to save data or are in areas with poor service, they now have the option to turn on WiFi-only mode to use Google Maps entirely offline. Users will need to download areas for offline use in order to use Maps while offline. This offline toggle only affects Google Maps, so users can continue to use other apps and their phones as normal. In addition, Android users now also have the option to save offline maps to an SD card if their devices support them. Earlier this year, Google introduced the ability for users to compare trip prices from ride services (like Uber) without leaving Google Maps. Google has now added new ride service options for users in multiple countries. In a blog post, Amanda Bishop, product manager for Google Maps, detailed the additions: In addition to showing options from Uber, we’re now showing GO-JEK rides in three cities in Indonesia, with 10 more cities coming soon (Android, rolling out on iOS), and Grab rides in 24 cities throughout Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand (Android, rolling out on iOS). We’ve also expanded the availability of Gett, Hailo and MyTaxi in select cities across Ireland, Poland, Italy, Austria, Russia and Israel (Android, iOS).

  SOFTPEDIA® DESKTOP Windows Games Drivers Mac Linux MOBILE Android APK Phones Tablets WEB Webscripts Web Browsers NEWS Softpedia > News > Web / Internet Life > Web resources FLASH SALE: VDownloader      50% OFF! Google Will Kill Flash in Chrome by the End of the Year GO "HTML5 by Default" to become the standard in Chrome 55 Aug 9, 2016 19:05 GMT  ·  By Catalin Cimpanu  ·  Share:  Google is delivering on its promise made in May to kill Flash and replace it with HTML5 by default. The company has announced today plans regarding Flash support in upcoming Chrome versions. Google's Anthony LaForge, the engineer tasked with managing Flash in Chrome, has said that, starting with Chrome's next version, Chrome 53, set for release in September, the company intends to block any Flash content that's "loaded behind the scenes." Google will block "behind the scenes" Flash content in Chrome 53 This term refers to Flash content not visible on the page, usually small pieces of code used to fingerprint users, in most cases employed by analytics firms. Based on Google's Chrome statistics, this accounts for 90 percent of all Flash files loaded in a Chrome browser today. The move comes to complement a change made in Chrome in September 2015, when the company decided to pause less important Flash content in Chrome 42, requiring users to click on the object before playing. "HTML5 by Default" will arrive in Chrome 55 But the good news doesn't end here. LaForge also announced that, by the end of the year, with the release of Chrome 55, the company plans to make HTML5 the default experience for viewing audio and video content in Chrome. This means that, for any website offering multimedia content, Chrome will first look for the HTML5 version, and then, only if the HTML5 version is not found, it will allow the browser to play it via Flash. However, this does not mean webmasters are allowed to slack on their jobs. For those sites, Google still plans to block Flash content and only allow it to play if the user clicks a button inside a notification they'll receive. In Flash-related news, Adobe has announced today that, in August 2016, Flash won't receive any security updates. #Chrome#Flash#Adobe Flash#Google Chrome#kill Flash subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Opera 39 Comes with Video and Search Pop Out Feature, Personalized Newsreader Mozilla Plans to Remove Hello in Firefox 49 Mozilla Adds FlyWeb IoT Extension to Firefox Nightly Builds Firefox to Block Non-Essential Flash Content Starting August 2016 iPhone 8 to Feature Traditional Wireless Charging like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Lenovo Builds a New Microsoft Surface Clone and It Looks Fabulous Anonymous Hackers Want McAfee to Be Trump’s Security Adviser, Call for March Hackers Could Infect Headphones to Spy on You HTC Desire 650 Announced, a Low Mid-End Smartphone for the Masses Glossy Black Galaxy S7 edge Leaks in Live Pictures Download Windows 10 64-bit Drivers for Acer’s Aspire TC-710 Desktop Model Intel Rolls Out Several New BIOS Versions for Its NUC Kits and Compute Sticks    Flash to be deprecated in Chrome 55 Related Apps SkyHistory: Record and save your Skype chat history and call logs with this application that offers contact management and bookmarking of important messages Outlook4Gmail: Synchronize your Outlook and Gmail accounts by transferring all the important data like contacts and calendar events between them Emby Server: A media server that you can use to organize your entire video, audio and photo collection and access it remotely from multiple devices WebSite Auditor: Enable on-page optimization for your website and assure its place in the top rankings of Google thanks to this comprehensive SEO program Betternet: Navigate the Internet anonymously or with a different IP address and get the opportunity to visit any website, using this VPN server application SEO SpyGlass: Monitor and manage the backlinks for your website in order to increase its online popularity and overall visibility, with the help of this handy tool Rank Tracker: Monitor your website's search engine rankings with the help of this comprehensive and reliable application, dedicated to webmasters Reader comments Load old comments   Opera 41 Released with Faster Startup Sequence more on: Opera 41 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Privacy scandal most people don’t remember haunts Pokemon Go CEO most people can’t name Chris Smith BGR NewsAugust 9, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Is Pokemon Go respecting your privacy when it comes to the amount of data it collects? That’s a question you should ask yourself considering that the game does require you to provide the game unlimited access to your location data and camera. And you’d think you should not be worried about Niantic swiping over your data for malicious use – or even spying purposes. But Niantic’s CEO has already been one of the central figures of a major privacy scandal while at Google, the Google Maps-related Wi-Fi sniffing “program.” You may not remember the whole thing, and you may think it’s not real, but a new report does an excellent job recapping its highlights, painting John Hanke as a CEO that you’d better think twice before trusting. DON’T MISS: Report: the iPhone 7 will be exactly what you’re expecting Mind you, nobody pointed the finger at John Hanke for Google’s Wi-Fi sniffing fiasco. But it all happened while he was heading one of Google’s most impressive teams, the division that was travelling the globe looking to expand the reach of Street View. Hanke reached Google after the search giant purchased his Keyhole startup, a CIA-funded venture that transformed into Google Earth – neat product, right? Referred to as Wi-Spy, the scandal affected Google on a worldwide level. It was discovered that Street View cars were equipped with Wi-Fi technology that could capture traffic from unencrypted wireless networks. The scandal spawned investigations, all summed up by The Intercept, in multiple markets around the world, including the US, UK, France, Canada, South Korea, New Zealand, Spain, Italy, Hungary, and Germany. Hanke at the time denied having any knowledge of the matter, and Google tried blaming the whole thing on a rogue engineer at first. However, as time went by, Google had to admit that serious mistakes were made with the Street View cars, but nobody was fired. The resulting reports have failed to identify a person responsible, though a Googler who still works at the company was identified as being the rogue engineer. Marius Milner (who said he had no contact to Hanke as The Intercept notes) also co-penned a patent that describes the kind of technology that a game such as Pokemon Go would use to convince a user to give up his or her information freely. That patent remained with Google after Niantic was spun off into its own entity. “The game objective can be directly linked with a data collection activity,” the patent reads. “An exemplary game objective directly linked with data collection activity can include a task that involves acquiring information about the real world and providing this information as a condition for completion of the game objective.” One conspiracy theory does suggest the game could be used for spying purposes. That certainly sounds like something Pokemon Go could do, though any such wrongdoings are yet to be proven. The company already went through a severe privacy-infringing scandal soon after it launched the game, as it was discovered the app got full access to a person’s Google account than necessary. The company fixed the problem, labeling an error that caused no harm. Moreover, Niantic’s privacy policy contains wording that suggests the company can collect and store information about a person, and some of the data can be shared with third-parties. Some think that Niantic’s history – or it’s CEO history – is enough to cause concern, even though there’s nothing to prove a link between Hanke and Wi-Spy. Writing to the FTC, EPIC said that “history suggests Niantic will continue to disregard consumer privacy and security, which increases the need for close FTC scrutiny as Niantic’s popularity – and trove of sensitive user data – continues to grow.” “Given the prior history of Google Street View, there is little reason to trust the assurance regarding the current state of Niantic’s data collection practices,” the company continued. Time will tell whether Niantic’s viral game will be used for anything else other than Pokemon fun. But what’s clear is that this particular Google privacy scandal will still haunt Niantic. At least for as long as some people still remember it – The Intercept does a great job summarizing it, so read it in full at this link.

Google Maps Features WiFi Only Mode and Offline Maps to SD Cards The new features already started rolling out Aug 9, 2016 18:15 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Back in June, we reported that Google was testing new features in its Maps application, namely tools that regarded the WiFi Only mode on offline maps that could be transferred to SD cards. The new features would allow users to save space on their smartphones and make sure they don't use up their mobile data. The Mountain View-based giant has announced that it started rolling out new features to its Google Maps application. The WiFi Only mode will allow users to set Google Maps to only work when connected to WiFi so that they could save up on mobile data and use Maps offline. Basically, users could enable mobile data on their smartphones to access other applications while Google Maps stays passive and doesn't eat up any. The second feature that Google has introduced is the option for users to save maps to their SD cards while in offline mode. The feature will allow them to save up space on their smartphones and store offline maps on the SD card. Google has also brought about some expanded commuting abilities, and users will be able to compare ride services like Uber with additional transportation services such as GO-JEK and Grab rides. In addition, Gett, Hailo, and MyTaxi have also gotten expanded availability inside the Google Maps app. The improvements are only visible to users from outside the US, mainly in European and Asian markets. Not long ago, Google Maps added support for areas of interest, which would allow users to see which area in the city is the most populated and where most activities are organized.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (4 Images) #Google#Google Maps#WiFi Only Mode#Uber#Offline mode reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Google adds WiFi Only Mode and other features to Maps app (4 Images) 01 02 03 04 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Moovit App Allows Users to Contribute Transit Information HERE Maps Rebranded to HERE WeGo, Welcomes New Features Google App V6.2 Beta Reveals Details About Google Assistant Google Maps for Android N Developer Preview Crashes on Android Auto iPhone 8 to Feature Traditional Wireless Charging like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Lenovo Builds a New Microsoft Surface Clone and It Looks Fabulous Anonymous Hackers Want McAfee to Be Trump’s Security Adviser, Call for March Hackers Could Infect Headphones to Spy on You The LG V20 Has Been Successfully Rooted Galaxy S6 and S7 Owners Complain About Samsung’s Stock Email App Facebook Is Testing a New Snapchat-like Camera Feature Google Adds Stranger Things Stickers to Allo, New Themes to Arrive Soon 4 photos    WiFi Only mode in Google Maps New Android APKs VivaVideo APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:19 GMT PowerDirector APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:08 GMT WeVideo APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:04 GMT Amazon Rapids APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:02 GMT ActionDirector APK: Updated November 23rd, 13:58 GMT DataEye APK: Updated November 23rd, 13:46 GMT JOOX APK: Updated November 23rd, 13:46 GMT Reader comments Honor 8 Hands-On Impressions: Some High-End Specs Mixed with Premium Design more on: Honor 8 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

This is especially true the higher your character level grows. The constant thirst to hit PokeStops whenever and wherever you can for more items can be a bit much for casual player. It’s subtle, but sometimes it feels like the game is ever so gently nudging you toward making small purchases to help make your life easier. You can do this using PokeCoins, Pokemon Go’s in-game currency, but like most freemium games you’ll come across, requires a lot of time and effort to obtain. There are 2 main ways to get PokeCoins in Pokemon Go: by taking over gyms or simply by using real money to buy them via in-app purchase. In this post we’ll explore both options and show you that even if you feel like caving in and buying PokeCoins, there’s still an easy way to get them for free using someone else’s money. Let’s dive in. HARD: Taking over as many Gyms as possible In order to gain free PokeCoins in Pokemon Go, the “easiest” way is by taking over gyms. To do this, you’ll either need to topple an opposing team’s gym, or add a Pokemon to your team’s gym by leveling up its prestige. For every Pokemon you’ve placed in a gym, you gain 10 PokeCoins as a “Defender Bonus” and can collect once every 24 hours in the Shop by clicking the shield icon. Since you’re only allowed to collect once every 24 hours, the idea is to place your Pokemon in as many gyms as possible before collecting your defender bonus. This is easier said then done, as waiting too long can result in someone else taking over your gym, killing your chance at collecting its defender bonus. For folks limited on time, this often means you’ll place a single Pokemon in a gym and immediately cash out, waiting until the next day to repeat the process. Okay, so getting free PokeCoins by taking over gyms isn’t really that easy and actually quite time consuming. Remember, no matter which team the gym belongs to, it’s going to take a lot of fighting and since it often requires more than a few rounds to topple or level up a gym, you’re going to need plenty of potions and revives to keep the fight going. Don’t forget that when leveling up your own team’s gym, your Pokemon wont die completely, meaning you wont need to use a revive to continue fighting with that Pokemon (just a few potions to heal him back up). Although finding potions and revives isn’t too big a problem (PokeStops are plenty and readily supply you with them), it’s the limited space in your bag that’s the real enemy. You’ll have to decide whether you want a bag full of potions/revives for gym battling, or Poke Balls for hunting new, more powerful Pokemon. The easiest solution to this is by upgrading your Bag storage to hold more items for each play-style, something the game charges a cool 200 PokeCoins for an extra 50 items. With each gym you’ve placed a Pokemon inside only paying out 10 PokeCoins each — you can see how this whole process requires a lot of time and effort on your part, something that may discourage casual players. But there’s also another way to obtain PokeCoins for free, and you don’t even have to leave  your house to get ’em… EASY: Get FREE Play Store credit by using Google Opinion Rewards The beauty of playing Pokemon Go on Android — or any freemium game for that matter — is a little app called Google Opinion Rewards. We’ve covered this app in the past, but in case anyone missed it, the app allows you to take quick and easy surveys in exchange for Google Play credit. You can then use this Google Play credit to purchase any digital goods in the Play Store — including in-app purchases like PokeCoins. Here’s how it works: Download Google Opinion Rewards on Google Play Open the app and tell Google some basic info about yourself Wait for the app to notify you of surveys Complete surveys in exchange for credits Use Google Play credit to purchase new games, apps, or in-app purchases Filing out surveys is mostly easy, but will require your full attention. To make sure your answers are authentic, Google will occasionally try and catch you slippin’ by either asking you the same question twice (seeing if you answer differently), or asking you questions like your opinion on a completely fictional theme park. Answer carefully and truthfully, or you’ll run the risk of Google cutting you off from receiving future surveys. When it comes time to purchase PokeCoins from inside the game’s shop, a popup will tell you how much it’s charging you and if you’d like to apply your current Google Play balance, aka the credits you’ve accumulated through Google Opinion Rewards. Just make sure the little box is ticked, click buy, and you’ll be all set. Each survey pays out its own unique amount, so don’t get discouraged if you come across a few 10 cent payouts. You may even find one that gives you a dollar, which roughly translates to 20 free Poke Balls or half of a bag upgrade. Remember, sometimes it’s not about playing harder, it’s about playing smarter.

Because there are a bunch of items making their way into your Gmail inbox every day, organization is essential. You can manually group and flag things if you’d like, but that takes too much time from the work day. Enter these new summaries, which take a bunch of updates — however many have arrived in your inbox — and group them together in a single box. Inbox for Gmail does something similar with Google Alerts, assuming you’re signed up to get them. Whenever a Google Alert for a topic is sent to your Gmail, it is added to a “Latest” summary simply called “Google Alerts — Topic Name.” If you want to read one, just click it and it’ll expand. Otherwise, alerts can be marked as read. Finally, there’s also a Google Drive integration that allows users to insert a Drive link directly into an email, set the permissions for that link, and/or save any email attachments straight to Google Drive. Less notably, this update allows users to delete items from within the inbox and to drag-and-drop contacts between the email composition fields (cc, bcc, etc) on the web.

Google My Business Insights Statistics Broken? Aug 9, 2016 • 7:53 am | (0) by Barry Schwartz | Filed Under Google Maps Prev Story Next Story It looks like the Google My Business insights section, where you can see statistics on your Google Maps / Local listings, is stuck and not updating past August 5th. Steven Erlich posted about it on Twitter yesterday and I checked and my stats are also stuck. Here is a graph showing where it stopped: Many folks are seeing 0 clicks, impressions and any results passed August 5th but I do believe it was August 2nd the other day. So I am hopeful it is catching up and just like all those typical Search Console delays, that this is also going to catch up soon. Forum discussion at Twitter.

Techmeme received a notification within Google Search Console for Hacked with spam. It said "a hacker may have modified your site to contain spammy content. To protect visitors to your site, Google's search results may label your site's pages as hacked." The issue is, these are editorial links and embeds. Techmeme's own editors are linking to sites like the Wall Street Journal and Fortune Magazine and Google is labeling that as spam. Here is the notification: Here is when you drill in and see it is for WSJ or Fortune links: Gabe Rivera posted these on Twitter and said "probably a glitch, but it's funny+ironic how Techmeme's normal Google coverage ended up flagged as a hack." Matt Cutts responded it might be related to the payday loans stuff, which is confusing Google? @gaberivera @googlewmc sigh.

Google Keyword Planner Showing Data Ranges For Advertisers Without Campaigns, A Bug? Aug 9, 2016 • 8:28 am | (7) by Barry Schwartz | Filed Under Google AdWords Prev Story Next Story The Google AdWords community is scratching their heads this morning after trying to use the Google AdWords Keyword Planner and to find that it is only giving back data ranges when there is no campaign set up. The error being shown to these search marketers reads: This page shows ranges for search volumes. For a more detailed view, set up and run a campaign. Previously, you did not need to set up and run a campaign to get pretty accurate search volume metrics. But something changed this morning. Here is a screen shot: Google's very own AdWords account on Twitter seems to be confused as well. They are telling those asking, they will look into it and get back to them. Here are those tweets: @dasjanik Hi Janik, I'm just checking this for you, will reach out to you as soon as I have an update. -Po— Google AdWords (@adwords) August 9, 2016 @RohanKagalkar Hi Rohan, I'm looking into this and I shall get back to you as soon as I have an update. -Po— Google AdWords (@adwords) August 9, 2016 Meanwhile, many are very confused by the results the tool is now giving. They think the tool is broken when it might be just a change in policy to only give better data to those who are running campaigns. Although that logic seems a bit wrong because some may want better data before deciding to run a campaign? This change comes a month or so after a bug removing keyword planner access and starting false rumors. Forum discussion at Twitter. Update: August 12, 2016: Google posted an announcement in the AdWords Help forum saying: As of this week, previous technical issues affecting the Keyword Planner tool are now resolved. Some important updates to keep in mind: Most advertisers will see search volume data in Keyword Planner as usual. Advertisers with lower monthly spend may see a limited data view in the Keyword Planner. For example, you may see values such as 0, 1-100, 100-1K, 1K-10K, 10K-100K, 100K-1M, 1M+ in the average monthly searches column. In addition, other advertisers may trigger the limited data view by reaching a limit on the number of searches for search volume data (specifically, requests to our API). Access to traffic forecast data will remain unchanged. These changes will ensure that AdWords advertisers are able to get the data they need to optimize their accounts.

BMCInternetMarketing 08/14/2016 12:48 pm Not provided, only broad match keyword volumes, 4 Google Ads on top and now data ranges.

What shud I do to get the old view? Paul An 09/07/2016 06:13 am I contacted Google support and here is what I found: If this problem happens to you, all you need is an active campaign, there is no minimum daily spend. If you have recently activated a campaign after just getting this problem, then you must wait a week for some history to be recorded. They said to me "Paul it has changed for all the advertisers because there had been multiple instances when people have used this tool to get keyword ideas and compete with our advertisers". He re-assured me if I have an active campaign it will kick in back to how it use to be and suggested I try Google trends in the meantime. https://www.google.co.in/trends/ Hope this helps. Dave LeBlanc 09/12/2016 02:04 am I have an active campaign and now I am getting data ranges. Google is getting frustrating. Mangesh Yadav 09/18/2016 06:02 pm Google restricted access for those who don't have active adwords campaign. It is really hard situation for small business owner and freelancers. Only option for the people is to rely on paid tools for keyword research. There are many paid tools like SEMrush, MOZ, Long tail pro etc. etc. but these are highly charged paid tools. But I have found cheaper keyword research tool which best alternative of Google keyword planner i.e., KW finder. I have taken paid subscription of it. http://bit.ly/2dbfsIz Infamous Thoro 09/25/2016 04:37 pm I'm using a cheap alternative keyword research tool since the restrictions.

In the latest example, a site that is not only spamming Google with scrapped content, but stealing that content directly from Google's very own Google Play store. The thread starts back a few weeks ago on Twitter and John Mueller from Google responds nicely. But he goes on and on and finally John calls him out saying "It looks like your site is still scraping the play store, is that correct?" The webmaster responds like any child would and says, well, this other site is doing it. In which John replies, "that doesn't sound like a good start :). It's important for us that sites provide unique value, are compelling and high-quality." Here are the set of tweets: @gelostics Manual actions can take some time to be reviewed...

Though many of those would be considered low-level jobs, consider that 31 former Google executives took jobs at the White House or federal advisory boards, and 15 from the tech giant or its lobbying firms ended up at regulatory agencies FCC or FTC, Watchdog.org reported. And 22 former White House officials ended up at Google, according to Watchdog.org. Either direction raises red flags at those levels. "If they have access to information on competitors and they go to Google … then you have to wonder if Google is getting an unfair advantage over others in their market," Scott Amey, general counsel for Project on Government Oversight, told Watchdog.org. Watchdog.org surfaced revolving doors between other federal agencies and Google: 25 officials in the federal intelligence field went to work at Google; 3 Google execs went to work at the Department of Defense; 18 former State Department officials went to Google; 5 went from Google to State; At least 18 former Google employees worked at one time at the U.S. Digital Service. Watchdog.org reports that in 2012, an FTC attorney took a job as Google Senior Policy counsel. Months later, the FTC would settle with Google in its antitrust probe, ruling the tech giant did not manipulate search results for its own benefit. Meanwhile, the European Commission is poised to hit Google with a record fine over the same issue, Watchdog.org reported.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Google Targets Microsoft, Amazon in Latest Cloud Moves New acquisitions and pricing cuts latest attempt to overtake industry leaders 0 by Nick Weig  @tbweig Aug 9, 2016 at 17:56 GMT4 months ago Google Cloud Services appears poised to trigger fresh competition with two of the top providers in the market today.  Tuesday, Alphabet (Google’s parent company), announced the acquisition of Orbitera.  Industry watchers put the price tag above $100 million. Orbitera was a startup helping other startups market their software to companies.  The purchase appears to be Google’s response to Microsoft’s launch of AppSource, a similar service to Orbitera that connects Office 365 with Azure services.  But that’s not the only move by Google this week. Google is trying to break into the Top 2 of cloud services.  But those spots are currently held by Amazon Web Services at #1, and Microsoft Azure at #2. New Cloud Price War? Google is also reigniting a price fight with industry leader Amazon.  Tuesday, Google cut the price of its preemptible virtual machines by up to a third.  The service competes with Amazon’s spot instances for AWS.  Both provide virtual CPU’s to companies in need of additional, short-term computing power. “We believe that the price reduction for Preemptible VMs will unlock even more computing opportunities and enable you to tackle interesting science and business problems.” Said Michael Basilyan, Google’s product manager. No doubt, this will force Amazon to respond in an ever growing battle over personal and enterprise cloud computing.  Because with each passing year, the cloud market increases by the billions and these three companies want as much of it as they can get. Recently, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in an interview that cloud computing must be Microsoft’s priority now.  “If companies don’t change,” said Nadella, “they’re not going to be around.”  It is a belief that other tech giants are certainly embracing as well.  As the revenue grows, the competition will become more fierce.  The hope is that will benefit professional customers and consumers in the form of lower prices and better services.  The fight for the cloud will only escalate from here.

Chris Urmson’s departure raises a host of questions about the future of driverless vehicles.

Hugh White 10:41 AM ET Donald Trump's Conflicts of Interest: A Crib Sheet Jeremy Venook 7:00 AM ET Adrienne LaFrance Aug 9, 2016 Technology Share Tweet … LinkedIn Email Print Text Size In the rapidly growing world of self-driving vehicles, Google is a clear leader. And Chris Urmson has been the human face of the company’s Self-Driving Car Project since it launched back in 2009. So it’s big news that Urmson is leaving Google, a move he announced over the weekend in a blog post. It’s also, so far, a big mystery as to what that means—for Urmson, for Google, and for any of its competitors. The biggest question is: Was he poached? Uber, famously greedy for autonomous-car talent, has recently announced several expansions to its own self-driving car ambitions—including testing driverless vehicles on public roads in Pittsburgh, and a new mapping effort in Mexico. Uber also has a track record of scooping up Google’s best. It hired the software designer Brian McClendon, previously one of Google’s most high-profile executives, to head its maps division last year. Urmson makes it seem like his next plans are uncertain: “If I can find another project that turns into an obsession and becomes something more, I will consider myself twice lucky.” But Silicon Valley’s tech giants are famously secretive, especially in the realm of driverless cars. It wouldn’t be shocking, for instance, if Urmson wound up at Apple. What Urmson chooses next, and what happens to Google in his absence, remains to be seen. Little is known about Apple’s work on self-driving cars, though reports of mysterious middle-of-the-night work makes it sound like a Willy Wonka-run shop. The company has been ultra-cagey about discussing its ambitions for autonomous driving, though public records—including a patent filing revealed this week—offer some clues. “There is a joke in the Bay Area that if you know somebody in the vehicle space and they left their old job but they haven’t updated their LinkedIn, they must be at Apple,” Chris Gerdes, a professor of mechanical engineering at Stanford University, told me last fall. And there are other clues that Apple continues to ramp up its efforts on autonomous driving, like recently reassigning one of its most influential executives, Bob Mansfield, so that he can focus on the project, according to The Wall Street Journal. Then again, as one roboticist pointed out to me, many tech companies try to prevent people from company-hopping this way. “He likely has a non-compete clause for at least one (but probably more) years,” Missy Cummings, the head roboticist at Duke told me in an email. “I bet he pops up in a related field like drones or some other robotic field.” Adding more intrigue to Urmson’s departure are reports that he isn’t the only one leaving Google. John Markoff, writing for The New York Times, characterizes Urmson as “the latest in a string of departures by important technologists working on the autonomous car project.” Markoff also points out that the staffing changes come after Google hired John Krafcik, who was previously a chief executive at Hyundai America, to lead the car project as it spins out as its own company under the larger umbrella of Google’s new(ish) company, Alphabet. So maybe this is just one of those moments where a company is changing enough to prompt some of its big names to move on. That’s not unheard of—and Urmson did write that he is “ready for a fresh challenge”—but his departure still raises questions about how the Self-Driving Car Project will fare without him. Several people who have either worked directly with Urmson, or closely followed his work at Google, declined to speculate on what’s next, but underscored how important his contributions to Google have been. “His departure is certainly a loss for the project,” Mark Bergen and Johanna Bhuiyan wrote for Recode. “Urmson was the main engineer who built the code running Google’s autonomous software, according to one person who worked with the team.” Urmson didn’t immediately respond to my request for comment on Monday. “I have every confidence that the mission is in capable hands,” he wrote in his blog post. “There are many other problems or products this talented group of people could work on, but they’ve chosen self-driving cars because they understand the impact their work can have on making our roads safer and bringing everyday destinations within reach for millions of people.” What Urmson chooses next, and what happens to Google in his absence, remains to be seen.

Spencer saluted more than 200 attendees on Saturday, gathered at the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, D.C., for the annual conference of the National Policy Institute, which describes itself as “an independent organization dedicated to the heritage, identity, and future of  people of European descent in the United States, and around the world.” Spencer has popularized the term “alt-right” to describe the movement he leads. Spencer has said his dream is “a new society, an ethno-state that would be a gathering point for all Europeans,” and has called for “peaceful ethnic cleansing.” For most of the day, a parade of speakers discussed their ideology in relatively anodyne terms, putting a presentable face on their agenda. But after dinner, when most journalists had already departed, Spencer rose and delivered a speech to his followers dripping with anti-Semitism, and leaving no doubt as to what he actually seeks. He referred to the mainstream media as “Lügenpresse,” a term he said he was borrowing from “the original German”; the Nazis used the word to attack their critics in the press. Continue Reading Frederick Carl Frieseke / Wikimedia The Running Conversation in Your Head Julie Beck What a close study of "inner speech" reveals about why humans talk to themselves Language is the hallmark of humanity—it allows us to form deep relationships and complex societies. But we also use it when we’re all alone; it shapes even our silent relationships with ourselves. In his book, The Voices Within, Charles Fernyhough gives a historical overview of “inner speech”—the more scientific term for “talking to yourself in your head.” Fernyhough, a professor at Durham University in the U.K., says that inner speech develops alongside social speech. This idea was pioneered by Lev Vygotsky, a Russian psychologist who studied children in the 1920s and noted that when they learned to talk to other humans, they also learned how to talk to themselves, first out loud, and eventually, in their heads. Continue Reading Mike Segar / Reuters The Electoral College Was Meant to Stop Men Like Trump From Being President Peter Beinart The founders envisioned electors as people who could prevent an irresponsible demagogue from taking office. Americans talk about democracy like it’s sacred. In public discourse, the more democratic American government is, the better. The people are supposed to rule. But that’s not the premise that underlies America’s political system. Most of the men who founded the United States feared unfettered majority rule. James Madison wrote in Federalist 10 that systems of government based upon “pure democracy … have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property.” John Adams wrote in 1814 that, “Democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts and murders itself.” The framers constructed a system that had democratic features. The people had a voice. They could, for instance, directly elect members of the House of Representatives. But the founders also self-consciously limited the people’s voice. Continue Reading Yamada Taro / Getty What’s So Great About American World Leadership? Hugh White The U.S. voters who rejected decades of bipartisan foreign-policy consensus might be on to something. How has America come to elect a president who so starkly repudiated decades’ worth of the largely bipartisan vision of U.S. global leadership? And if that vision won’t be the basis of American foreign policy in the 21st century, what will replace it? The big message of 2016 is that large numbers of American voters, Democrat and Republican, do not buy what their political leaders have been selling for so long, and that includes foreign policy. The evidence of this from Trump’s victory is reinforced by Senator Bernie Sanders’ remarkable showing in the Democratic primaries, and by years’ worth of public-opinion surveys showing the widespread view that the United States “does too much in helping solve world problems.” It is also reinforced by the high poll numbers of an outgoing president who has mounted his own quiet campaign against key elements of Washington’s foreign-policy orthodoxy. Continue Reading Carlo Allegri / Reuters Donald Trump's Conflicts of Interest: A Crib Sheet Jeremy Venook A semi-comprehensive list of the business concerns that may influence the president-elect as he prepares for the nation’s highest office Though several previous presidents have entered office with private fortunes to their names, none has done so with a business empire nearly as large or complicated as that of President-elect Donald J. Trump. Estimates of Trump’s wealth vary substantially: While he self-reports a net worth of $10 billion, independent agencies have arrived at valuation generally between $3 billion and $5 billion. The unprecedented nature of Trump’s business interests, coupled with the many precedents that Trump broke throughout his campaign—not releasing his tax returns, for example, which severely limits attempts to understand his financial situation—has provoked speculation that his presidency may bring about equally unprecedented opportunities for conflicts of interest. Trump’s response—provided on Twitter—only reinforces concerns that he will make little effort to avoid entangling his business and personal interests, and will instead attack those who point that out.

Every day in June, the most popular wedding month of the year, about 13,000 American couples will say “I do,” committing to a lifelong relationship that will be full of friendship, joy, and love that will carry them forward to their final days on this earth. Except, of course, it doesn’t work out that way for most people. The majority of marriages fail, either ending in divorce and separation or devolving into bitterness and dysfunction. Of all the people who get married, only three in ten remain in healthy, happy marriages, as psychologist Ty Tashiro points out in his book The Science of Happily Ever After, which was published earlier this year. Social scientists first started studying marriages by observing them in action in the 1970s in response to a crisis: Married couples were divorcing at unprecedented rates. Worried about the impact these divorces would have on the children of the broken marriages, psychologists decided to cast their scientific net on couples, bringing them into the lab to observe them and determine what the ingredients of a healthy, lasting relationship were. Was each unhappy family unhappy in its own way, as Tolstoy claimed, or did the miserable marriages all share something toxic in common?

Here’s why the race between Governor Pat McCrory and Democrat Roy Cooper isn’t over yet. DURHAM, N.C.—It’s been two weeks since Election Day, which means that in 49 states, residents know who their governor will be next year. North Carolinians, however, are still waiting to see. At the end of balloting on November 8, Democrat Roy Cooper, the current state attorney general, had a lead of a few thousand votes over Governor Pat McCrory, a Republican. Cooper promptly declared victory, but McCrory has not conceded the race, and the state has not been able to declare a winner. On Monday, Cooper announced a transition team, while McCrory accused him of “circumventing the electoral process.” Cooper’s lead fluctuated throughout the day on Tuesday as more counties returned their final canvass, but as of writing it was a little more than 6,000 votes out of roughly 4,700,000. (The most up-to-date results are here.) Continue Reading Etienne Fabre / SSAC A Shocking Find In a Neanderthal Cave In France Ed Yong A rock structure, built deep underground, is one of the earliest hominin constructions ever found. In February 1990, thanks to a 15-year-old boy named Bruno Kowalsczewski, footsteps echoed through the chambers of Bruniquel Cave for the first time in tens of thousands of years. The cave sits in France’s scenic Aveyron Valley, but its entrance had long been sealed by an ancient rockslide. Kowalsczewski’s father had detected faint wisps of air emerging from the scree, and the boy spent three years clearing away the rubble. He eventually dug out a tight, thirty-meter-long passage that the thinnest members of the local caving club could squeeze through. They found themselves in a large, roomy corridor. There were animal bones and signs of bear activity, but nothing recent. The floor was pockmarked with pools of water. The walls were punctuated by stalactites (the ones that hang down) and stalagmites (the ones that stick up). Continue Reading Ricardo Moraes / Reuters The Average 29-Year-Old Derek Thompson Forget media archetypes of older Millennials as college-educated singles living in cities. The typical 29-year-old is living with a partner in the suburbs—without a bachelor’s degree. What is the typical life experience for an American on the verge of turning 30? This is a hard question to answer, no matter who is asking. But it’s become especially difficult for an industry responsible with providing the answers: the national press. An irony of digital media is that the Internet distributes journalism, but it concentrates journalists. Jobs at media sites like The Atlantic, BuzzFeed, or Gawker are five-times more likely to be located in New York or Washington, D.C., than television-news jobs. The clustering force is only getting more centripetal: The share of reporting jobs in Los Angeles, NYC, and DC increased by 60 percent between 2004 and 2014. It’s easy to imagine many downsides of this agglomeration, like the dissolution of local reporting, but a subtler risk is that well-educated journalists in these dense cities wind up with a skewed impression of the world, a “majority illusion” based on the extremely unrepresentative cross-section of the country that’s immediately around them. To be fair, being a reporter in Des Moines or rural Nebraska, while it provides a better view of Des Moines and rural Nebraska, doesn’t offer a universal window into the average experiences of all Americans, either. For that, one needs something else, like a national survey.

Credit: Gartner More like this Cloud gets cheaper. Google's preemptible VMs generally available Google launches virtual machines for the budget-minded Google offers cut-rate computing for low-priority jobs Video How the FCC fast-tracked its journey to the cloud News this morning from Google, which is announcing some price changes for some of its cloud computing products. For a little background here, Google is widely regarded as being in third place in the public cloud infrastructure wars, trailing a long way back from Amazon Web Services (AWS), the front-runner, and Microsoft Azure in second place. Indeed, the most recent Gartner analysis about the public cloud space had a few surprises (in particular the absolutely abysmal scores for both IBM and Oracle) -- one of the surprises was that Google has lost a little ground to both Microsoft and AWS, with the former seemingly moving closer to AWS over the past year. (The Gartner Magic Quadrant, pictured above, is fascinating for anyone who covers the space. There is plenty of scuttlebutt suggesting that the MQ, delayed by months, was the subject of intense threats, cajoling and requests from poorly performing vendors, but those are, as yet, unproven allegations.) Anyway, back to the topic at hand: Google and its cloud ambitions. Google has always seen its technical excellence, and its ability to commoditize formerly expensive services, as part of its core DNA. Today's news strongly speaks to the second one of those two skills. To this end, the company is dropping its prices on its so-called Preemptible VMs by up to 33%. Google ascribes its ability to reduce these prices to a tuning of its algorithms and an improvement in its efficiency and analysis of usage patterns. That experience, alongside the growing scale of the Google Cloud Platform, is allowing Google to make this change. Of course, there is also the unsaid piece, and that is that being able to stand ahead of its competitors in the ranking of the most economical vendor is also of benefit, and these particular cloud components lend themselves to price-cutting. Preemptible VMs are just like any other Google Compute Engine VM, with the caveat that they cannot run for more than 24 hours and that Google can preempt (shut down) the VM earlier if it needs the capacity for other purposes. This obviously allows the company to use its data center capacity more efficiently and share the savings with customers. The expectation being, of course, that some of those customers will be new ones, attracted to the price savings. The whole notion of these transient VMs makes sense -- for workloads that don't require guaranteed persistence, it's a great way to leverage compute at the lowest possible price. Google explains that it has seen Preemptible VMs being used in use cases as varied as analytics, rendering, image processing, genomic analysis and financial analysis. And they're pretty easy to use -- simply adding a single flag (funnily enough, "--preemptible") in the Google cloud compute instance creates the command. The resource for the VMs themselves come out of Google's "excess" capacity and, as such, varies by location, time and day. Generally, availability is highest on nights and on weekends. In terms of how Google decides on which preemptible VMs to can, it states that it avoids preempting too many VMs from a single customer and, given the choice, preempts VMs that were launched most recently. While this might be a bit frustrating at first, in the long run, Google suggests that this strategy helps minimize lost work across customers' clusters. And because Google doesn't bill for VMs preempted in the first 10 minutes, it saves on costs, too. Preemptible VMs are a good idea, but that isn't really what this story is about -- rather, it is a look at whether cost savings are a primary driver for public cloud adoption and consumption. Or is added value, near-infinite scalability and an ability to abstract non-core business the primary driver? The fact is, for all the pundits talk about added value, IT departments still generally run as a cost center, and as such, a cost saving is a powerful selling point. Whether this will make an appreciable difference to Google's standing in the Gartner Magic Quadrant remains to be seen, but as part of a broader maturing of the platform, it is a good move.

More than 300 friends and relatives of 27-year-old Vanessa Marcotte crowded into the First Congregational Church in bucolic Princeton to share their grief and comfort one another in the wake of the tragedy. “She was a really good person,” said Justine Popik, also 27, a fellow runner who went to high school with Marcotte. “She was just a very passionate person.” Topik said her parents have warned her to avoid wooded areas and said she might start carrying mace with her when she goes for runs. NYC Google employee killed jogging in Massachusetts Many mourners carried flowers and candles as they exited the small church. Outside, more than a dozen firefighters, some of whom responded to the horrific murder, stood at attention. Vanessa Marcotte, 27, was found dead after she failed to return from a jog near her mother's Princeton, Mass., home. (Instagram) "It's a sad day," said fire chief John Bennett. "We're here to show out love for the family and the community." Bennett and his firefighters planned to shine a massive Navy spotlight toward the sky later in the evening as a tribute to Marcotte. Police have not identified any suspects in the Sunday night slaying. Marcotte’s burned body was found in the woods about a half-mile from her mother’s home. The killing had many in the quiet town of 3,500 on edge. “It would be scary if it was someone locally,” said Tim Clemence, 29. “And even scarier if it were someone from New York who followed her." The town fire chief, John Bennett, said. Massachusetts State Police search the woods off Boylston Ave. in Princeton for evidence Monday. (Boston Globe/Boston Globe via Getty Images) Police have asked residents to report any suspicious activity and urged them to use caution throughout the quiet town. Marcotte’s mother reported her daughter missing Sunday night when she failed to come home from a jog around the neighborhood. The New York City-based Google staffer was in town visiting family, officials said. A state police K-9 unit found the woman’s body later that evening. She was missing clothes and had burns on her head, feet and hands, sources told local media. "This has shattered the community," said Kristin Johnson, 32, another Princeton runner. "This is a really common running route. It's a seven mile loop, a great training route. Since this has happened nobody is running alone. This whole thing doesn't feel real." Marcotte was a 2011 graduate of Boston University. (Instagram) Police said they don’t know if the attack was random and have not said how Marcotte was killed. Marcotte worked as an account manager for Google in New York. In a statement Monday, the company said it is “deeply shocked and saddened.” “Vanessa Marcotte was a much loved member of the Google team, working in our New York office for the last year and a half, and known for her ubiquitous smile, passion for volunteer work and love of Boston sports,” the company said.

By Alistair Charlton August 9, 2016 18:58 BST Aaron Puzey is cycling 900 miles using an exercise bike and Samsung Gear VRYouTube Aaron Puzey is attempting to cycle the length of Britain, from Land's End to John O'Groats, using a virtual reality headset and an exercise bike. Having set the famous route on Google Maps with waypoints every few metres, Puzey is cycling along routes driven by Google's Street View cars. These images are then loaded into his VR headset and displayed in a way which makes the scenery look like it is passing by as he cycles. Puzey set off on 15 May and by 8 August, his most recent post at the time of publication, had reached Manchester. He still has approximately 550 miles to go, which Google estimates will take another 49 hours of cycling to complete. Puzey is filming his entire trip, with edited highlights uploaded to YouTube tracking his progress. To keep his journey accurate, Puzey is avoiding motorways, where bicycles are forbidden, and sticking to country lanes. A Samsung Gear VR is his headset of choice. Though not the highest-quality VR option on sale today, it is arguably the best compromise between cost and quality. He is providing an amusing running commentary on the scenery as he cycles past. While the distant horizon "feels real", he says, close-up images of forests and woodland "just seem like big lumps". He also said going uphill feels more difficult and downhill easier, despite the resistance on his bike not changing. "Holding the handlebars really helps for not feeling disorientated," he added. He said he experienced less motion sickness cycling in VR than when he was viewing Street View while sat on the sofa. A common issue, he said, was the lens of his Gear VR steaming up and sweat stinging his eyes. "The single biggest problem with the Street View data is the high compression on the depth information." Puzey told The Verge. "Some things, like buildings, fit very well to this model and look quite solid, but things like trees and hedges and anything lumpy often just look a mess. I've also seen things like squashed bugs on the Google camera, bad colours in some scenes and strange black sinkholes. However, even with those problems it still feels like I'm there." Puzey promises a future video will explain how viewers can try this challenge for themselves.

 Police search for killer of 27-year-old Google worker found dead in Massachusetts woods Laila Kearney, Reuters Aug. 9, 2016, 1:34 PM 8,471 facebook linkedin twitter email print A driver's license photo released by the Worcester County District Attorney's Office showing Vanessa Marcotte of New York, whose body was found Sunday night in the woods about a half-mile from her mother's home in the town of Princeton, Massachusetts, about 40 miles west of Boston. Worcester County District Attorney's Office via AP NEW YORK — Investigators searched on Tuesday for clues in the case of a 27-year-old Google employee who was found slain in woods near her mother's Massachusetts home hours after leaving for a jog, the police said. The body of Vanessa Marcotte, who worked as a healthcare account manager in Google's New York City offices, was found by a police K-9 unit late on Sunday near the small town of Princeton, the police said. "We are asking for the public's help in finding the person or persons who killed Ms. Marcotte," the Massachusetts State Police Department said in a statement. Law-enforcement officials have released few details about the cause of death or state in which Marcotte was found. WCVB-TV reported, citing unnamed police sources, that she had been sexually assaulted and was burned on her head, feet, and hands. Police officials said on Monday they did not know whether her killing was a random act. Marcotte was visiting her mother's home from her residence in New York, where she had worked for Google for more than a year. "Vanessa Marcotte was a much loved member of the Google team ... and known for her ubiquitous smile, passion for volunteer work, and love of Boston sports," Google said in a statement. "We are deeply shocked and saddened, and our thoughts are with her family and friends." Marcotte's death came days after a 30-year-old woman, Karina Vetrano, was sexually assaulted and killed while jogging alone along an overgrown path in New York's Howard Beach. Authorities, who have had few leads in the Vetrano case, have said there is no evidence connecting the two cases. Read the original article on Reuters. Copyright 2016. Follow Reuters on Twitter.

Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Instagram YouTube RSS Skip to content SEO News Content Marketing Social Media Paid Search Work Life Advertise 10 Keyword Tools You Need to Know Tools & Analytics July 13, 2016 Tools & Analytics Eli SchwartzJuly 13, 2016 1.7KSHARES 14.3KREADS 1.7KSHARES 14.3KREADS Eli Schwartz 1.7KSHARES 14.3KREADS For the past, present, and mostly likely the distant future, as a search marketer, keywords are your currency and language. Keywords are what drives the topics of the content you create, your PPC campaigns, and even peripherally the interests you target on social media. Access to a tool with keyword ideas and indicators of relative importance of one keyword over another is an absolute necessity.  With the recent news of Google blocking access to its Keyword Planner to anyone without an active account, it is prudent to be prepared with options in the event this restriction becomes the norm. Here are 10 alternatives to Google’s Keyword Planner for finding keyword ideas and search volume predictions. Ahrefs: Alongside Ahrefs’ backlink reporting and organic traffic dashboards, they have a really powerful keyword research tool which provides keyword ideas as well as search volume for all match types. For those conducting keyword research for SEO, Ahrefs has a keyword difficulty score metric which recently in head to head testing was declared to be slightly more accurate than other tools that offer a similar feature. Ahrefs is a paid tool, but if you sign up for a free trial and then cancel, you will maintain access to a free version of their tool. SEMRush: SEMRush has a keyword tool that is driven by its huge dataset of search data from 26 different countries. SEMRush results return keyword ideas, estimated search volume, estimated cpc, keyword difficulty score, and current ranking domains for a keyword. Moz: Moz recently launched their own dedicated keyword explorer as a supplement to their SEO research suite. You can choose from nearly any location in the globe to conduct your search and  filtering options allow you to exclude your specific query term to get more ideas, or even choose only question phrases that contain your keyword. Keyword results include related query ideas alongside estimated search volume and a keyword difficulty score. Moz also shows domains currently ranking for the keyword and recent mentions of the keyword. Keywordtool.io: This tool scrapes keyword suggest ideas from Google, YouTube, Bing, and even Amazon. You can choose suggested keywords from every Google TLD, language, and location and there are similar options for the other engines it supports. For free, you will get hundreds of suggested keywords, but you need a paid plan to access search volume estimations. Scrapebox: Mostly known as a black hat SEO tool, Scrapebox has plenty of white hat uses too (see this great guide from Neil Patel) including conducting keyword research. With Scrapebox, a small handful of keywords will easily turn into hundreds and even thousands of possibilities. Scrapebox is software that needs to run on a Windows desktop environment, but the upside is that it’s a one-time purchase vs a monthly or annual subscription. Wordstream: Primarily a paid tool to help search marketers manage their pay per click campaigns, Wordstream has a free keyword tool which allows a limited number of searches. Free results only include related keywords, but Wordstream’s paid subscribers can see search volume, too. Bing: While not the obvious choice if you are conducting research for Google campaigns, Bing’s keyword tool can still provide helpful insights on related keywords. You need to have a website verified in Bing’s Webmaster Tools in order to use the tool, but it is otherwise free to use.  The keyword ideas are not as broad as those that you might get from other free keyword tools; however, one advantage in Bing’s favor is that they display both broad and exact match search volume. Keyword Discovery: This is one of the oldest keyword tools in existence and they pull search data from the widest list of search resources. While I have found, at times, their predicted search volumes vary widely from what Google shows, this is a very useful tool for discovering ideas you might never have otherwise found. Its a paid tool, but you can conduct a limited amount of free searches. KWFinder: Keyword searches can be focused in five different countries or most of the world’s most popular languages. Results include a keyword difficulty score and keyword ideas can be filtered by a number of different metrics. This is a paid tool, so you can only conduct a limited amount of searches for free. 7Search: 7search.com was one of the world’s first PPC networks; although, you may not have met someone who’s ever used it. Their keyword tool is really simple to use and its free. Results include keyword ideas as well as search volume on the 7Search network. Even if Google maintains its non-advertising requirement status quo to use Keyword Planner, it’s still helpful to use some of the tools above when conducting keyword research just to get another perspective. Global Options Additionally, if you are conducting SEO or SEM campaigns in places around the world where Google faces actual competition—such as in Asia—you might be better off using keyword tools created for that local market. Baidu: The largest search engine in China has a free keyword tool as a part of its webmaster tools as well as a Google Trends-like product that gives hot trends and related keywords. You can also use DragonMetrics for keyword research (paid tool with a free trial) which is like a an Ahrefs/SEMRush/Moz for Baidu. ADVERTISEMENT Naver: The dominant search engine of Korea has a keyword tool to find popular keywords on its network. (Note: Naver’s tools work best on Internet Explorer) Yahoo Japan and Yahoo Taiwan: These are the leading search engines in their respective markets and they each have their own keyword tools (both behind login walls). Their keyword data should be the same as what Google shows since they use Google’s organic results. Yandex: The leading search engine in Russia and also very popular in Russian-speaking countries. Their keyword tool has Russian as well as English data.   If you are looking for a guide on how to do keyword research, check out the linked chapter of our SEO guide.  Image Credits Featured Image: Screenshot by Elis Schwartz.

So it makes sense that, when a Gaza City-based journalism group claimed that the nation of Palestine had literally been wiped from Google’s maps, readers were, well — indignant. Dozens of Middle-Eastern news outlets have covered the “backlash,” and tens of thousands have Facebook-shared and tweeted it. [What was fake on the Internet this week: Why this is the final column] “The Forum of Palestinian Journalists condemns the crime carried out by Google in deleting the name of Palestine, and calls for Google to rescind its decision and apologize to the Palestinian people,” reads part of the statement from the Forum of Palestinian Journalists, posted to its website Aug. 3. “… The move is designed to falsify history, geography as well as the Palestinian people’s right to their homeland, and [is] a failed attempt to tamper with the memory of Palestinians and Arabs as well as the world.” The only problem? Google Maps didn’t delete Palestine on July 25, as claimed. It hasn’t changed its labeling of the region at all. If you search “Palestine” in Google Maps today, you’ll get the same result you would have gotten five months ago, when a guy named Zak Martin began a Change.org petition on the subject: The map view defaults to a demarcated, but unlabeled, region stretching from Hebron in the south to Jenin in the north, and from Jerusalem to the Jordanian border. The results for “Palestine” in Google Maps (Google Maps) If you click on any of the cities in this region, Google does label them as Palestinian, and the Wikipedia-sourced Knowledge Box that pops up describes Palestine as a “de jure sovereign state.” That language has been in effect since 2013, when Google — following the lead of the United Nations — changed its designation to “Palestine” from “Palestinian territories.” [You probably haven’t even noticed Google’s sketchy quest to control the world’s knowledge] Still, even if the current outrage is misplaced — and people are outraged, check out #palestineishere — it does raise some interesting questions about the power of mapping technologies like Google’s. In their attempts to dispassionately document the physical world online, tech companies often end up shaping our understanding of it, too. That’s not something that we tend to think about often, but it does become pretty obvious when a map changes/is said to have changed, or when we compare different maps against each other. Some Palestinians have said, for instance, that they’re switching to Microsoft’s Bing Maps, because those do label Palestine as its own discrete place. Apple Maps, meanwhile, neither labels the territory nor differentiates it at all from the Israeli state. The results for “Palestine” in Apple Maps (Apple Maps) This isn’t the only disputed region that Google has had to contend with. In May, I wrote about some of the discrepancies in the search engine’s Knowledge Boxes, where Taiwan is described as an independent country, and Ireland’s fourth-largest city is referred to by its nationalist name. Jerusalem, which is claimed by both Israel and Palestine, is listed as Israel’s capital alone. And Crimea, which is likewise claimed by both Russia and the Ukraine, is mapped differently depending on which country you’re searching from. The interpretations these platforms make go well beyond their labels, too. In June, Justin O’Beirne — the former head of cartography for Apple Maps — published an exhaustive comparison between the design and cartography of Apple and Google Maps. Among other things, O’Beirne observed numerous, major differences in the way Apple and Google label places, and what they choose to label by default: the former prioritizing landmarks, like Madison Square Park or the Empire State Building; the latter focusing on transit options, like subways and bus stops. A comparison of Apple and Google Maps of Manhattan. (Justin O’Beirne) In other words, if I’m in Manhattan and checking directions on my phone — something most of us probably do in new places — I’ll have subtly different impressions of the city, based on nothing more than my map application. “The maps are more different than they appear at first glance,” O’Beirne concludes. “And each map shows a surprisingly different view of the world.” For users, that means it’s really important to think about our maps critically — to remember that even Google and Apple, which appear so removed and authoritative, bring their own interpretations to these important questions. The outraged hashtaggers of #PalestineIsHere and #BoycottGoogle may have pegged their critiques to a nonevent — but at least they’ve learned that lesson. Liked that? Try these!

The company announced that sign-up for residents and businesses would begin soon in five Atlanta neighborhoods: Midtown East, Piedmont Heights, Virginia-Highland, Morningside/Lenox Park and Old Fourth Ward. Following the announcement, Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed joined guests for a tour of the Fiber Space and conducted the first live speed test using Google Fiber’s gigabit internet. The Fiber Space is designed to provide the community with a place to hang out, share ideas, sign up for service, and explore Google Fiber’s options. Google officials also said residents would have a limited time to sign up for the service so fiber optic wiring can be installed in homes. The deadlines for the five neighborhoods announced today are: Midtown East: Sept. 29, 2016 Piedmont Heights: Sept. 29, 2016 Morningside/Lenox Park: Dec. 8, 2016 Old Fourth Ward: Dec. 8, 2016 Virginia-Highland: Dec. 8, 2016 Inside the Google Fiber space at Ponce City Market. Customers across the metro Atlanta area living in apartment buildings can use the Apartment Finder tool to see if Google Fiber is available in their building or if it is on track to come to their building. Likewise, single-family residential customers and businesses can sign up to receive notifications for their area so they can be among the first to receive Google Fiber.

By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | August 9, 2016 -- 17:00 GMT (10:00 PDT) | Topic: Cloud Google on Tuesday announced that it's lowering prices on preemptible virtual machines (VMs), a cheap -- albeit somewhat unreliable -- option for customers looking for the cheapest way to access the public cloud. After tweaking algorithms, improving efficiency, and analyzing usage patterns, Google product manager Michael Basilyan said in a blog post that preemptible VMs are now up to 33 percent cheaper. Preemptible VMs are just like any other Google Compute Engine VM, with two big caveats: They cannot run for more than 24 hours, and Google can shut them down if it needs the capacity for other purposes. While it's not a guaranteed resource, it gives customers cheap access to any extra cloud capacity. Basilyan highlighted the ways Google customers have made use of preemptible VMs since they were launched last year, including analyzing data, rendering movies, and processing satellite imagery. Customers have used thousands of preemptible VM cores in a single job, he said. Amazon Web Services similarly offers Spot Instances, allowing users to bid on extra AWS EC2 instances. The major cloud players have been competing over pricing for some time. However, Google arguably comes closest to a model that strives to let customers to pay only for what they use. In addition to offering preemptible VMs, Google earlier this year expanded its Custom Machine Types offerings. They also offer sub-hour billing and sustained use discounts. Microsoft continues its pivot to being all about cloud services It's not over for Windows and devices. But Microsoft's future is increasingly about the cloud and subscriptions, as its financials and corporate priorities show.

Interestingly, international mainstream corporate media has completely blacked out any coverage of the incident or the global outrage it has sparked.   Google removes #Palestine and replaces it with #Israel on Google Maps. Let them know that Palestine exists. https://t.co/MqAho3YDD5 — 7amleh حملة (@7amleh) August 4, 2016 The Palestinian Journalists Forum (PJF), in a statement released on Friday in the Middle East Monitor, condemned Google’s decision to remove Palestine from its maps, saying it “is part of the Israeli scheme to establish its name as a legitimate state for generations to come and abolish Palestine once and for all.” The group says the removal of Palestine’s name from the Google Maps was a blatant attempt to undermine Palestinian statehood forever and claims the move is just another attempt to distort history and geography. “The move is also designed to falsify history, geography as well as the Palestinian people’s right to their homeland, and a failed attempt to tamper with the memory of Palestinians and Arabs as well as the world,” the statement added. In addition, the group demanded that Google reverse the name changes made on July 25, noting that the move was “contrary to all international norms and conventions.” Most of the areas claimed by the State of Palestine have been occupied by Israel since 1967 in the aftermath of the Six-Day War. Its independence was declared on November 15, 1988, by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in Algiers as a government-in-exile. When the keyword Palestine searched in Google Maps it directs you to Gaza, Judea and Samaria marked with a broken borderline, but nothing labeled Palestine. This marks a dramatic reversal of course for Google, as it was only in May 2013, that Google “recognized” Palestine by changing the text of its Palestinian homepage from “Palestinian territories,” to “Palestine” — pushing the idea of Palestinian statehood into unprecedented reaches. As of September 2015, 136 (70.5%) of the 193 member states of the United Nations and two non-member states have recognized the State of Palestine. Many of the countries that do not recognize a State of Palestine nevertheless recognize the PLO as the “representative of the Palestinian people.” It must also be noted that historically the United States has used its superpower status and leverage, through the Foreign Assistance Act and other measures, to discourage other states and international organizations from extending recognition of Palestinian statehood at the behest of the Israeli government. Make no mistake that this latest move by Google is an intentional act meant to undermine the idea of Palestinian statehood, and reveals Israel as having an inordinate amount of leverage over U.S. corporate and governmental decision-making. A  petition to restore Palestine to Google Maps on Change.org has gathered over 150,000 signatures as of Monday, and the Twitter hashtag #BoycottGoogle has begun trending on the social media site. Google is making itself complicit in the Israeli government’s ethnic cleansing of Palestine https://t.co/4GZTSWdPbF pic.twitter.com/qgL2fl5Q2K — Anwar Prince (@AnwarPrince14) August 8, 2016 “The omission of Palestine is a grievous insult to the people of Palestine and undermines the efforts of the millions of people who are involved in the campaign to secure Palestinian independence and freedom from Israeli occupation and oppression,” and “Whether intentionally or otherwise, Google is making itself complicit in the Israeli government’s ethnic cleansing of Palestine,” reads the petition. More than 750,000 Palestinians have been displaced since the foundation of Israel in 1948, and Jerusalem continues to expand its illegal settlements into the West Bank. One of the biggest factors underpinning U.S. support for this reality is the “Israel Lobby,” arguably the most powerful special interest group in the United States. The lobby has been able to skew American foreign policy away from U.S. national interest while simultaneously convincing the American public that its goals are aligned with that of America.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Android’s ‘Verify Apps’ feature may keep QuadRooter threats at bay Eric Abent - Aug 9, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Yesterday we told you about a rather scary set of vulnerabilities that could potentially threaten as many as 900 million Android devices. Known as “QuadRooter,” the set of four vulnerabilities was discovered in Qualcomm drivers, lending to how widespread the threat is. However, today we’re getting confirmation that a feature introduced way back in Android 4.2 Jelly Bean could stop QuadRooter in its tracks, and it was designed specifically for scenarios like this. QuadRooter needs to sneak onto your device through an app, and the only way to get one of those apps onto your phone is by side-loading. Side-loading apps is a fairly common thing, but it does make devices significantly more vulnerable to malicious content than downloading an app through the Google Play Store. Google recognized this problem and, with the release of Android 4.2 Jelly Bean, rolled a “Verify Apps” option into Google Play Services, giving users a safety net when they try to install an app that can harm their devices. In some cases, your phone will point out that the app you’re installing may be dangerous – recommending against installing it – or, in cases where the app you’re installing is known to be malicious, will block installation altogether. A Google spokesperson confirmed to Android Central that Verify Apps along with Android’s SafetyNet protections will be enough to stop dangerous apps housing the QuadRooter exploits from ever making it onto your device. The best part is that for most users, Verify Apps will be turned on, as it’s automatically activated by default. Most users have probably never had a reason to turn it off, either, as the toggle for the setting is only available through Developer Options, a menu that is usually hidden. Even with that in mind, it’s best to still take precautions and avoid side-loading apps until the QuadRooter exploit has been fully patched. We’re almost there, with Google confirming that three of the four exploits were patched in August’s Android security update, and that a patch for the fourth is incoming as part of September’s update.

Google Cloud Platform’s preemptible VMs are now up to 33% cheaper Posted Aug 9, 2016 by Frederic Lardinois (@fredericl) 0 SHARES Next Story There’s caffeinated Soylent now For a while, Google, Amazon and Microsoft were constantly undercutting each other’s cloud computing prices, but lately, it’s been pretty quiet on that front. Today, however, Google is firing a new salvo by reducing the price of its preemptible virtual machines (VMs) by up to 33 percent. Preemptible VMs are Google’s version of Amazon’s spot instances for AWS (Microsoft Azure, though, doesn’t currently offer this type of instance). As the names imply, there is no guarantee how long you’ll be able to use a given machine, though. Google and Amazon use this system to bring up their utilization levels by offering access to these VMs for cheap when demand is low, but as demand picks up, they rotate them back into their regular pool, where they can charge more. The major difference between Google’s and Amazon’s approach is that while AWS uses an auction system for pricing these machines, Google offers its users set prices — and those prices can be up to 80 percent lower than those of the equivalent non-preemptible machine. On Google’s platform, these machines can also only run for up to 24 hours, so they don’t work well for every workload (on AWS, they will run until the spot price increases above what you paid). If you — and your workloads — are flexible, though, you can save quite a bit of money on using this type of VM. “Our customers are using Preemptible VMs to analyze data, render movies, process satellite imagery, analyze genomic data, understand financial markets, transcode media and complete a variety of business and engineering tasks, using thousands of Preemptible VM cores in a single job,” Google product manager Michael Basilyan writes in today’s announcement. “We believe that the price reduction for Preemptible VMs will unlock even more computing opportunities and enable you to tackle interesting science and business problems.” With a bit of luck, today’s move by Google will also drive Amazon to drop its prices. If you can’t use preemptible machines for your workloads, by the way, it’s worth taking a look at Google’s new “VM Rightsizing Recommendations.” This tool analyzes your VM utilization and then gives you suggestions for scaling machines up or down to better meet your needs. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Amazon Web Services Founded 2006 Overview Amazon Web Services provides information technology infrastructure services to businesses in the form of web services.

Users can get extremely close to one another, and that can lead to an uncomfortable infringement of space and a bad experience that drives people away from VR. Google’s Daydream Labs is experimenting with ways to combat abuse in VR and one successful test involved the creation of virtual poker dogs. The dogs demonstrate that one way to deter users from harassing fellow players is by creating personal space. (We’ve seen this from Altspace before, too.) When players left the poker table in Google’s experiment, their screens turned to black and white, and their avatar disappeared from their opponent’s view. A glowing blue personal space bubble then guided them back to their seat. You can see a demo in the embedded video above. Google says these changes were enough to encourage players to not steal chips or invade personal space. The company also experimented with rewards for positive behavior. If players high-fived each other, they’d then see a fireworks animation and hear a loud slapping sound. Aggressive actions didn’t come with any fun bonus features, so people tended to stick with those positive interactions.

It’s now official, along with some other new features. Google Maps now includes a “Wi-Fi only” toggle in its Settings. As its name suggests, this mode will only use data when connected to Wi-Fi. With this mode, you can save on data or avoid slow-loading maps due to spotty cellular service by relying only on Wi-Fi. Plus, this toggle means that you can keep Google Maps in Wi-Fi-only mode without toggling off cellular for all of your other apps. Another new feature on Google Maps for Android is SD support. With it, you can save your offline maps to your device’s external SD card, which many folks use to supplement their phone’s internal storage. Finally, Google Maps now supports GO-JEK ride services in three cities in Indonesia, with 10 more cities coming soon. This feature is on Android and rolling out to iOS. Google is also adding Grab rides in 24 cities in Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand, as well as expanding the availability of Gett, Hailo, and MyTaxi in cities in Ireland, Poland, Italy, Austria, Russia, and Israel.

Well apparently the tests went well, as Google has started rolling out the addition to Google Maps on Android. Wi-Fi-only mode can be toggled on in settings and will limit the app to only working with your saved offline areas unless you're connected over Wi-Fi, while the rest of your device operates as normal. Maps for Android is also picking up SD card support, allowing you to download those offline maps without eating up your local storage. The new updates have begun rolling out to Android users now, but as with most Google updates, it will likely take a couple weeks before everyone has it on their device.

Is It Time For Songwriters To Bring Down The Music Licensing System? The DOJ ruling forcing 100% song licensing has sent shockwaves through the music industry. No one is affected more than songwriters, particularly the many who co-wrote with others.  David Lowery has a solution for songwriters: STRIKE! ___________________________________________   By musician and artist advocate David Lowery of The Trichordist You may not realize this yet but the new 100% DOJ licensing rule, attempts to put an enormous financial and compliance  burden on BMI/ASCAP songwriters.  Read the rule folks. Within the next year we are required to indemnify our PROs and the services that use our songs, that our co-writers won’t sue if they start licensing 100% of a co-written song.  IF YOU HAVE  CO-WRITER AGREEMENTS THAT SAY EACH WRITER ADMINISTERS THEIR OWN SHARES YOU WILL HAVE TO RENEGOTIATE THOSE AGREEMENTS. I have a remarkably small number of songs in my catalogue of 400+ songs that will require this fix.  But I estimate it will be a minimum $1,000 in legal fees for each of those agreements.  If you are a professional songwriter in Nashville, instead of a performer/songwriter like me it is likely that you have a lot of co-writer agreements to modify. You could be facing tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees to renegotiate those co-writer agreements. Fuck these people.  I’m sick of it. Aren’t you? We tried to reason with these fucks and explain just how disruptive this 100% licensing bullshit was gonna be. THE FUCKING US COPYRIGHT OFFICE TOLD THEM IT WOULD BE CHAOS. Yet they didn’t’ listen. The DOJ Antitrust Litigation Division Section III appears to be completely in the pocket of Google so they just went ahead and did it anyway.  Because it fucking helps Google, no one else. It is the only logical explanation. Maybe we should bring on the chaos?  If songwriters are gonna be locked in Kafkaesque nightmare with no due process, no appeal, no reasoning and no recourse?  Maybe we should bring the whole system down. Break the entire music licensing system. Fortunately I think the DOJ overreach on this one may have given us the monkey wrench we needed. See songwriters can’t really strike.   We aren’t considered laborers so we can’t form unions.  The closest thing we have to unions are our non-profit  “performing rights societies”  or PROs. The largest and most well known of these are ASCAP and BMI.   And these have been under “temporary” justice department consent decrees for 75 years,  basically because there was essentially previous threat of something like a strike. Because we are not unions and we produce a good, if we collectively decided to withhold our goods I suppose the US Government (and Google controlled)  DOJ Antitrust Division Litigation Section III could come after us for collusion or some other trumped up charge.  And given their thuggish, corrupt and unconstitutional behavior since ex-Google lawyer Renata Hesse arrived to oversee this division you can bet they WOULD  come after us. However I think the DOJ over reached on this one.  Here’s how we get away with it. We don’t do anything. Look at the clause below. “To facilitate this adjustment and ease the transition to a common understanding, the Division will not take any enforcement action based on any purported fractional licensing by ASCAP and BMI for one year, as long as ASCAP and BMI proceed in good faith to ensure compliance with the requirements of the consent decrees. During this year, to the extent doubt exists about the PROs’ ability to license specific works, the Division expects that ASCAP and BMI will take the steps necessary to eliminate such uncertainty, including obtaining from songwriter and publisher members the assurances they need and, to the extent necessary, removing works from their licenses if they cannot be offered on a full-work basis. In order to facilitate this transition, the Division strongly urges industry stakeholders to explore means of further promoting transparency, including transparency regarding the identity of rightsholders from which music users may license any works they cannot obtain from ASCAP and BMI.” You see even though this is a Kafkaesque nightmare, the DOJ still seems to realize they can’t go back in time and make illegal private contracts between songwriters.  Something to do with the constitution….   But they can require PROs to ask songwriters to give them “assurances” that there are no longer co-writer agreements that prevent 100% licensing. But the DOJ can’t make us give those assurances. What if we didn’t?  What if we did nothing?  Give no assurances and provided no information on co-writes and whether co-administration agreements exist that prevent full work licensing. Remember we are not legally required to respond.  And if the DOJ tries to force us to respond…well that is exactly how autocracies get started. See here is the thing.  We call their bluffs.  This isn’t like we are dealing with the Counter Terrorism part of the DOJ, these are a bunch of pussy assed Harvard/Yale/Berkeley political appointees that would cross the street or lock their car door if they saw a musician walking down the sidewalk towards them. Is the DOJ Antitrust Litigations Section III, really just gonna let all millions of songs in the BMI and ASCAP catalogues disappear from radio, tv, syndicated television shows, bars, jukeboxes, streaming services,  and webcasting services?  Especially considering many of these services are locked into four, six even eight year contracts with BMI and ASCAP.  There just went their cushy revolving door job at Sirius XM, YouTube or Cox Media! We should just sit back eat some popcorn and enjoy the show.  Let’s make Renata Hess and the DOJ explain to music users what the fuck just happened. DO NOTHING. MAKE THEM FIX IT.

The body of Vanessa Marcotte, who worked as a healthcare account manager in Google's New York City offices, was found by a police K-9 unit late on Sunday near the small town of Princeton, police said. "We are asking for the public's help in finding the person or persons who killed Ms. Marcotte," the Massachusetts State Police Department said in a statement. Law enforcement officials have released few details about the cause of death or state in which Marcotte was found. WCVB-TV reported, citing unnamed police sources, that she had been sexually assaulted and was burned on her head, feet and hands. Police officials said on Monday they did not know whether her killing was a random act. Marcotte was visiting her mother's home from her residence in New York, where she had worked for Google for more than a year. "Vanessa Marcotte was a much loved member of the Google team ... and known for her ubiquitous smile, passion for volunteer work, and love of Boston sports," Google said in a statement. "We are deeply shocked and saddened, and our thoughts are with her family and friends." Marcotte's death came days after a 30-year-old woman, Karina Vetrano, was sexually assaulted and murdered while jogging alone along an overgrown path in New York's Howard Beach. Authorities, who have had few leads in the Vetrano case, have said there is no evidence connecting the two cases.

It is now officially licensed to sell clean electricity too, in an rare move that could save the company hundreds of millions of dollars in energy costs and corporate taxes. The California tech giant last week won federal approval to start selling electricity, on top of its iPhones, iPads, MacBooks, watches and headphones. Rather than buying solar and wind electricity from another operator, like most technology firms do, Apple can also sell the juice from its own clean power plants.  The iPhone maker is part of a growing group of companies pledging to run most or all of their operations on renewable energy. Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon, for example, have also invested in wind farms and solar plants to help power their data centers and warehouses — a move that cuts both greenhouse gas emissions and energy and tax bills. While apps, files, emails, Pokémons and other digital trappings seem to exist only in the cloud, the facilities needed to store and process that data are extremely energy-intensive.  View photos The Apple Store in New York City's Upper West Side.More Image: kena betancur/Getty Images Data centers use anywhere from 10 to 50 times the energy per floor space of a typical commercial office building, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. In the U.S., these spaces account for roughly 2 percent of the nation's total energy consumption. Internet-focused companies are facing pressure from environmental groups and their shareholders to power data centers not with coal or natural gas but with emissions-free alternatives. The activist group Greenpeace, for instance, ranks these companies as dirty or green in its annual “Click Clean” report. In response to such scrutiny and their growing energy footprints, more companies in tech and other sectors are investing in renewables. View photos Image: GREENPEACE Last year, large corporations signed contracts to buy a record 3,200 megawatts of clean energy capacity. That equals about half of all the “power purchase agreements” signed in 2015, in an industry usually dominated by utilities. “It's a dramatic change from even five years ago,” Jenny Heeter, senior energy analyst at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden, Colorado, told Mashable.  The tech sector's focus on renewables has been a big boost for the broader U.S. transition to cleaner energy sources. In 2014, the IT industry bought about 8.3 million megawatt-hours of renewable energy, about 17 percent of all the electricity sold in New York State, according to federal energy data.    By 2020, the tech sector could buy between 18.5 million and 37 million megawatt-hours of renewables, NREL estimated. That's more than 16 percent of all the electricity used in California.   “We have seen more and more companies making these 100-percent renewables goals and looking for ways to buy renewables,” Heeter said. “It’s definitely becoming a large market.” Greening Apple Apple’s latest effort to sell clean electricity — not just buy it — is relatively unique in the tech industry. Among its peers, only Google’s parent Alphabet has federal approval to sell wholesale power, which it won in 2010. The strategy has three key benefits for the tech giants: It bolsters their green credentials and cuts their environmental footprint; it gives them independence from the broader U.S. electric grid; and it eases a portion of their total tax burdens. “It is a big step, and not all companies want to be in the energy business,” Heeter said. “We don’t expect that would be a common strategy for all IT companies,” she added. On Aug. 4, the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) authorized Apple’s subsidiary Apple Energy LLC to sell wholesale energy, power capacity and other services needed to provide reliable electricity. The FERC filing "supports our plan for 100 percent renewable energy," Apple told Mashable. Apple said it sought federal approval so it could sell wholesale power from its California Flats Project with First Solar, a major U.S. solar company, and the utility Pacific Gas & Electric. Apple CEO Tim Cook in February 2015 announced an $850 million deal to buy 130 megawatts of solar power capacity over 25 years from the project in Monterey County.  That should power all of Apple’s California stores, offices, headquarters and a data center. But it's still a tiny slice — 0.01 percent — of America's total power capacity of nearly 1.2 million megawatts, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates.  California Flats will eventually encompass 2,900 acres of land and more than double in size, to 280 megawatts of solar capacity. Apple will then own all of the project's output. With the project, Apple will pay less per unit of electricity than it pays now to buy from a utility company.  The move should save the company "hundreds of millions of dollars" in avoided energy costs, Lisa Jackson, Apple's vice president of environmental initiatives and former head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, said at Wall Street Journal's ECO:nomics conference in March 2015. Apple consumed 966 million kilowatt-hours of electricity in 2015 across all its U.S. and global facilities, the company estimated in its 2016 Environmental Responsibility Report.  The company said it also planned to use its power-selling abilities for other future projects. The MacBook producer already owns a handful of large solar projects in the U.S., including a 20-megawatt facility in Nevada and a 50-megawatt solar plant under construction in Arizona.  Additionally, Cook has pledged to make the company’s new “ spaceship” headquarters in Silicon Valley into the “greenest building on the planet.”  The building, still under construction, will run exclusively on renewables when it’s finished in late 2016, Cook said. Apple says the company is 93 percent reliant on renewable energy supplies worldwide, marking progress toward its goal of being a 100 percent renewable energy company.  Still, the company faces plenty of obstacles in its quest for environmental stewardship, including the heavy energy usage of its overseas manufacturing facilities and the lack of recycled materials in its products.  The dilemma isn't unique to Apple. Many major tech companies have set clean energy goals and released their consumption data, yet some of these numbers may not be completely accurate, according to several studies.  For example, in its 2015 "Click Clean" report, Greenpeace graded Amazon Web Services an F for transparency.  The Utility Approach For corporate behemoths like Apple and Google, each with market caps of more than $500 billion, there can be financial benefits to owning clean energy projects outright, rather than just signing long-term power contracts. Companies with a sufficiently large tax liability can tap into a pair of federal incentives designed to encourage more investment in clean energy.  The Investment Tax Credit gives tax breaks to owners of residential and commercial solar projects that is worth 30 percent of project costs. The Production Tax Credit gives wind farm developers 2.3 cents for every kilowatt-hour of electricity that the turbines produce. The tax breaks not only help make clean electricity cheaper; they also chip away at huge corporate tax bills. For companies that own solar and wind farms, however, they may not need to use 100 percent of the electricity their projects produce. And if they have excess supplies, then it makes sense for their subsidiaries to sell the extra electrons into the wholesale market and generate revenue, NREL's Heeter explained. “It gives them some extra flexibility … and the ability to make sure that any excess electricity is sold into the market, instead of not being used,” she said.  Google said its subsidiary, Google Energy LLC, buys and sells power in the wholesale markets in areas where it can’t directly supply its data centers with renewable energy.

The strategy requires a substantial investment in time and resources. Google and Apple, for instance, both created separate subsidiaries to run their energy operations. Applying for regulatory approval is also a long, expensive process laden with paperwork. “It’s not an easy process, and many companies see it as not really their core business,” Heeter said. So although major IT firms are investing heavily in renewables, most are unlikely to see federal regulatory approval.  Purchasing Power  The more common approach for companies is to sign long-term power purchase agreements with another developer, which Google and Apple also do. The deals are generally considered less risky and cumbersome than owning a power plant outright.  “You’re just buying the output. Then it’s up to somebody else to manage how those renewables get put on the grid,” Heeter said. Microsoft, for example, has signed two 20-year power purchase agreements: one to buy 175 megawatts of wind energy from a project in Illinois, and the other to buy 110 megawatts from a North Texas wind farm. With those agreements, and by buying wind, solar and hydropower straight from the grid, Microsoft has been able to power 44 percent of its data centers with renewable energy, the company said. “But this means we have the opportunity to do even more,” a Microsoft spokesperson said.  The Redmond, Washington-based software giant recently announced a new goal to power 50 percent of its data centers with clean power by the end of 2018. When asked if Microsoft would create a Microsoft Energy, a spokesperson said: "We’re committed to playing a role in accelerating the transition to a clean energy infrastructure, whether that is through the purchase of a project, or backing projects through long-term purchase commitments." Facebook said it powered 35 percent of its data centers with renewable energy in 2015 and also aims to reach 50 percent by 2018.   View photos Facebook's data center in Prineville, Oregon.More Image: Facebook Two of Facebook’s data centers in Iowa and in Sweden are powered by renewable energy. Data centers currently under construction in Ireland and Fort Worth, Texas will be entirely powered by wind energy. Facebook declined to comment on whether the Menlo Park-based company has plans to create a subsidiary for energy selling like Apple and Google.  As for Amazon — which is drawing more and more of its profits from powering the internet through Amazon Web Services —  the e-commerce giant set a goal to power 40 percent of its facilities with renewables by the end of this year. The company oversees three wind farms — in Indiana, North Carolina and Ohio — and one solar farm in Virginia.  Other tech giants have taken new steps into renewable energy and have committed to a 100 percent goal. This year, Salesforce signed two power purchase agreements with wind farms in Texas and West Virginia.  “As a cloud company, it is our responsibility to seek out clean energy sources to power our data centers,” said Patrick Flynn, director of sustainability at Salesforce.  This post was updated to reflect the correct figures for electricity use in New York State and California.  Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next Hospitalized rapper Kanye West said to be in spiritual crisis Reuters Thinking about buying a Google Pixel?

SUBSCRIBE Google injects more context into micro-moments As Google continues to refine its search results to better serve users in their moments of need, columnist Adam Dorfman looks at how recent developments in contextual search may impact brick-and-mortar businesses. Adam Dorfman on August 9, 2016 at 10:07 am More More than a year has gone by since Google introduced the concept of micro-moments, which Google defines as times “when people reflexively turn to a device — increasingly a smartphone — to act on a need to learn something, do something, discover something, watch something, or buy something.” Micro-moments constitute a consumer behavioral shift with implications for businesses that operate brick-and-mortar stores. Merchants need to be more agile and relevant to convert micro-moments to revenue, especially at the local level. For brands, the question is not whether micro-moments are important, but where micro-moments are headed. Micro-moments are becoming more contextual We know that micro-moments at the local level are getting bigger. According to Google, mobile “near me” searches have increased by 146 percent year over year. These kinds of searches are intent-based moments of immediacy. For instance, Google (citing data from Hotels.com) indicates that 74 percent of mobile hotel bookings are for same-day check-in. These “near me” micro-moments are becoming more contextual, too. As Google notes, consumers are not just looking for “hotels near me.” They’re also seeking “pet friendly hotels near me.” They’re not simply looking for “auto dealers near me,” but also “Chevy Silverado for sale near me.” I believe those contextual searches are often based on three elements: your specific needs as a consumer, where you and the business are located and the time of day or season. Google understands this reality and is taking steps to help businesses and consumers respond to context. For example… Google Maps and dwell time As reported in Search Engine Land, Google Maps is using crowdsourced data to show searchers typical dwell times at specific locations. The dwell-time data still requires refinement — as SEL reported, estimates can consist of a precise number (say, 15 minutes) or a wide range (15 to 45 minutes, which is less helpful). Still, combined with the hour-by-hour peak time data Google has already been collecting, dwell time data should give businesses more insight into how much time consumers are spending in a store and at what times. With this kind of data, businesses can anticipate that searchers are using their smartphones to make time-based decisions and respond to those micro-moments with contextual content. For instance, a Starbucks could alert a consumer searching for “Frappuccino near me” about locations nearby that have the shortest dwell times, too. A business could also use that data to troubleshoot customer service issues that might be turning away customers during micro-moments. For a high-end retailer, short dwell times at certain hours might be a sign of a service issue that needs addressing, whereas a coffee shop that lives and dies by volume might uncover a problem with slow service by examining this crowdsourced data. Smarter filters Google recently unveiled hotel smart filters that give people the option of filtering search results based on their specific context. As Google noted in a July 12 blog post, [T]ravelers can filter based on rating or price with one tap on their phones. We’ll make it easy to search for exactly what people want, like “Pet-friendly hotels in San Francisco under $200” to find the perfect hotel for them. Google also noted that it’s going to be easier for consumers to track flight prices on Google Flights. Smart filtering and smarter searching clearly point to more contextual micro-moments, and it is unlikely Google is going to stop with travel. To be found during these kinds of searches, brands that operate locations need to be present with more contextual data that combines location identity data and attributes, such as payment methods accepted, accessibility, specialty services (for a restaurant, any specialty food served), and, yes, pet-friendliness. Businesses also need to think of their local ad spend more opportunistically and contextually. Google has cited the case of Red Roof Inn, which tracked data about flight cancellations at airports to serve up ads for nearby Red Roof locations just at the moment the hotel anticipated that delayed travelers would be looking for a place to stay. As a result, Red Roof Inn realized a 60-percent increase in bookings across non-branded search campaigns. What’s happening with hotels is just the beginning. Micro-moments are evolving in other ways as well, such as becoming more visually oriented, especially as Google responds to different ways people find businesses, goods and services. They need to create more contextually based data to be present — and contextually based content, such as mobile wallet offers — to turn those micro-moments into next moments of business (the moment that occurs after someone finds you during a search). By creating next moments in context, businesses will flourish in the contextual world Google is shaping.

SUBSCRIBE Google Search Console sending AMP notifications to encourage adoption Google is proactively pushing AMP through the Google Search Console message center. Barry Schwartz on August 9, 2016 at 9:19 am More Earlier this month, Google announced they are bringing AMP pages to all mobile search results in the future and opened a demo for searchers to play with it. In an effort to drive awareness of this update, Google has been messaging webmasters and site owners through the Google Search Console message center about adopting AMP. The message says “Create AMP pages to be shown in Google Search for” your site. Google has detected that your site has many pages that may benefit from being served as AMP pages. Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) are HTML pages that are optimized to load fast on mobile devices. Learn more about AMP benefits in the resources below. Valid AMP pages on your site will be eligible to be shown in search results and receive special badging in search results. These messages are going not to just publishers but to all websites, in some sort of order. The messages started going out last week, and here is a copy we received at our sister site, Marketing Land. Sites that are AMP-friendly already but are not publisher/news-oriented are getting messages that they can test their pages using the AMP demo site.

Domestic tech companies are straining at the leash to go global while also defending their home markets from foreign competitors. Even before the Didi/Uber battle unfolded, China’s tech firms were making waves. The global industry has been anxiously watching to see if the Chinese behemoths play a big part in the mergers and acquisitions game as they look to gulp down foreign companies. Home-grown giants such as Alibaba, and Tencent with its WeChat platform, have expanded across several countries although they still have a long road to travel before making worldwide impact. Meanwhile, Chinese majors in property, entertainment and heavy equipment are increasingly using the M&A route to acquire share of foreign markets. But the country’s tech companies have been mostly pushing their own brands overseas instead of jumping on foreign names. "Some Chinese tech companies have done well in Asian markets. Xiaomi is doing very well in India," says Jacob Cooke, the head of the Beijing-based consulting firm, WebPresence in China. "But many of them will find it difficult to impact western markets unless they come up with original designs and technology," he adds. "Copycats have very little respect [abroad]." China’s tech companies have been later starters in western countries than others from places such as India, South Korea and Japan. But they have grown rapidly on the back of the nation’s economic growth and vast domestic market in the past two decades. The government’s firewall, which puts restrictions on or simply bans western e-commerce giants such as Google, YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, has played a major role in keeping the domestic market reserved for Chinese companies, and boosting their growth. Although the firewall was built for political reasons, it has helped Chinese firms on the commercial plane. For example, Baidu dominates the search engine market at home because Google is nowhere on the scene. Now, with slower growth at home, new global opportunities beckon. In addition, protecting domestic companies from market erosion has become important. Apart from political reasons, the government is highly unlikely to open up the market for the likes of Google and YouTube any time soon. "If Google is allowed, Baidu will surely loose market share although it will happen gradually over time," Mr Cooke says, adding, "But Tencent’s WeChat has done well on its own merit and not just because Twitter is banned." These days, WeChat is challenging WhatsApp in several overseas markets. Jeffery Towson, a professor at Peking University, holds a somewhat different view. "For foreign internet companies, it is actually not the [Chinese] government that usually determines success or failure. It is most often the combination of ruthless local competitors and a little state help. Or simply not keeping up with rapidly changing [local] customers’ tastes." These are the some of the reasons why eBay, Expedia and Yahoo lost out in China, he says. In contrast, Google did pretty well in China while it was allowed, and LinkedIn is faring well this year. Uber put up an impressive fight before it fell to rival Didi. It is a complex situation and one cannot say foreign internet companies have no place in China, Prof Towson says. Some big Chinese tech companies that dominate the home market include: •Alibaba: Founded by the former English teacher Jack Ma, Alibaba has risen to dizzying heights spreading its e-commerce platform across several countries. Alibaba, which has helped China to sell its low-cost goods across the globe through platforms such as Taobao, has annual average revenue exceeding US$16 billion. It recently bought Youku Tudao, a service similar to YouTube. The group is trying to develop an ecosystem that includes logistics, payment services, cloud computing and targeted marketing services. Its AliExpress e-commerce platform is already doing business in markets such as Brazil and Russia. • Tencent: The company’s most well known product is the WeChat massaging service, which has nearly 700 million users. Most of the users are in China but the service is gradually expanding to other Asian countries to challenge WhatApp. It has an annual revenue of $16 million. The company also offers services that include digital content, mobile games and e-commerce. •Huawei: It is a giant, multi-product group competing with Apple and Samsung across the world in selling phones, tablets and other gadgets. It has offices in 100 countries. The Shenzhen-based company also runs a huge business offering heavy equipment for telecoms companies and is establishing mobile and fixed-line networks. Huawei is the leader in cloud computing in China, and is venturing out to other countries. The company claims to have filed 3,898 patent applications last year, which is more than any similar company in the world. business@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments Related Alibaba smashes Singles’ Day record as Chinese consumers open wallets Xiaomi targets China’s high-end market with expensive new smartphones China’s Xiaomi aims for Apple’s iPhone with Mi 5S Plus smartphone launch China’s proposed cyber law unnerves foreign players in cloud More Technology #UAEinnovators: 3D printing a tech advance in cardiac surgery at Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi Big Boys Toys and gadgets at Adnec BlackBerry Dtek60 review: Phone maker returns to the fray #UAEinnovators: New social shopping app from Emirati siblings that developed Yebab MOST VIEWED Business | All RAK opens unique Via Ferrata on Jebel Jais, the UAE’s highest mountain Database for Dubai buildings set to complete next year Formula One has proved to be a big win for Abu Dhabi hospitality BlackBerry Dtek60 review: Phone maker returns to the fray Dubai granted land decree a catalyst for city building, says official Maiden Airbus A350-1000 flight set for tomorrow Can Dubai property owner terminate deal with real estate agency for not fulfilling duties?

Since multiple cables typically attach to poles—think about cable television, telephone, etc.—a professional must reorganize them before attaching a new cable. This process, known as “make ready”, has become the next policy battleground in the fiber-dependent “game of gigs.” Battle lines are already clear. For example, the Louisville/Jefferson County, Kentucky, metro government recently adopted a “one touch make ready” proposal that would allow new providers to perform all the required work in the make-ready process themselves—meaning they would be moving equipment owned by competitors—provided they use a skilled contractor. Shortly thereafter AT&T, which has its wires on poles and outright controls a number of them in Louisville, sued the city, alleging the city has no legal jurisdiction under federal or state law to regulate pole attachments. Not surprisingly, Google, a new entrant in the field that could be among the first to benefit from faster pole-access fiber deployment, stood up in support of the city. AT&T countered that the proposal raised safety concerns and that Google could have access under terms to which it has agreed in other locations. The question, however, is not just about access but how to balance legitimate safety, cost and competitiveness concerns. In that effort Louisville is at the vanguard of a growing movement. San Antonio’s municipal utility, CPS Energy, has put in place a similar policy. North Carolina’s state broadband plan noted that a “’one touch’ policy . . . promotes safety and limits disruptions to the ROW,” or rights of way, and the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development’s recent broadband report called out “one touch” as a best practice. Last week a group of city council members in Nashville introduced an ordinance similar to Louisville’s. As in Louisville, Google Fiber is seen as the primary beneficiary, and incumbent providers have opposed the measure, in this case arguing,“Just because you spell your name with eight different colors doesn’t mean you can’t play by the rules that everybody else has to f*****g play by.” Why is this issue important to cities? Most mayors, in my experience, would like to ensure that all their businesses and residents have access to affordable, abundant bandwidth. The issue is that most don’t believe their cities have such broadband today. And while some might consider the city offering its own broadband service to meet that need, most look to market forces and private capital to do so. What cities need to improve local broadband is a new math: one that better balances the high costs of deployment and operations against the risk of returns that don’t match costs.

Hart August 4, 2016 Cities & Regions Rooftop solar: Net metering is a net benefit Mark Muro and Devashree Saha Monday, May 23, 2016 Over the last five years, cities have taken a number of steps to change the math of deployment, trying to lower the costs and risks of deployment in a way that enables capital to flow to new fiber. Google Fiber has driven significant changes but AT&T, CenturyLink, and my own organization, Gig.U, have worked with dozens of communities to find ways big and small to lower costs. “One touch make ready” proposals fit right into that effort. If implemented, they would cut both the time and cost for deployments, contributing to more affordable, abundant bandwidth. What’s more, they reduce disruption and improve safety on city streets, reducing the number of times that people need to drive a truck down a street or alley and climb up a pole to fix it. The opposition is not without merit, but it is important to break down the major concerns. Get city and regional policy updates from Brookings Enter Email Of course, incumbents always have an incentive to delay new competitors, and regulators and legislators should always question such efforts. The legal jurisdictional question, however, is a valid one. I am not an expert in such issues but would simply note that determining which federalist entity has the right to regulate pole access does not reflect on the core economic benefit of more efficient “make ready” work. As I favor broad municipal authority as a philosophical matter, and therefore hope Louisville wins the AT&T litigation, if the city loses, then the issue should go right to the front burner of federal and state decisionmakers. Safety is also a critical issue. There are a number of ways to address it, such as with bonding, certification, and notice, without giving competitors tools for delay. The fairness issue is also important, but the ordinance would apply to anyone building a new network or improving an existing one, not just Google Fiber. Further, cities that have granted Google Fiber certain rights have generally granted those same rights to incumbent telecom players, like AT&T, to lower the costs of upgrading their copper networks to fiber.

We should remember that both cable and telephone communications providers agreed to certain requirements in exchange for a government-mandated monopoly. While that monopoly is gone, they had decades of official protection from competition, circumstances that made the deployment economics easy. As a matter of policy, the FCC has correctly discouraged local governments from placing equal burdens on new entrants, finding that such requirements have “resulted in delayed entry, no entry, or failed entry.” Further, as we saw with the data from the National Broadband Plan, these networks are staggeringly expensive. Breaking free from the status quo requires both creative and viable economic models. Broadband operators are businesses, not charities. If communities do not work to lower barriers to entry and enable efficient builds, the necessary new investment simply will not happen. Access to certain private facilities to encourage network deployment is nothing new. Without the 1978 pole attachment law, we would not have had a robust cable infrastructure, just as without the 1992 program access rules, we would not have had a viable cable competitor in Direct Broadcast Satellite. Author B Blair Levin Nonresident Senior Fellow - Metropolitan Policy Program Revisiting the relationship between access to poles and multiple dwelling units and the deployment of next generation networks, as I have noted before, ought to be on the agenda for the next administration. But cities don’t need to wait. They should carefully follow the pioneering efforts of Louisville and Nashville to enable more efficient pole access. Moreover, to the extent they have jurisdiction, all cities should be exploring any methods that can lower the cost of deploying and operating future-proof broadband networks.

TechRadar pro IT insights for business Search RSS News Reviews Insights TechRadar Business Laptop/PC Printers Hardware Software Mobile working Security Networks Management Data centre & Cloud News Silver linings: How Google wants to beat Amazon and Microsoft in the cloud Silver linings: How Google wants to beat Amazon and Microsoft in the cloud By Max Slater-Robins Cloud services   Google means business in the cloud arena Shares Page 1 of 2: Introduction and data centre empire Introduction and data centre empire Cloud resurgence Google is a pretty old company compared to most internet giants. Facebook, which now connects over 1.6 billion people every month, was founded in 2004. Twitter, where most breaking news happens, was founded in 2006. LinkedIn, the social media outlet for the world of work, was founded in 2003. Google, on the other hand, was founded in 1998. The internet is what made Google into the behemoth it is today. Billions of people visit its search engine every week, billions more use Android, and – if everything goes to plan – Google's 'moonshot' projects will be used by billions more also. Alphabet is the company that controls Google and said moonshots, which include Google Capital (not related to the search engine), Verify (a health and medical research company), Google Fibre, Calico (a biotech research company), and many more. The parent company was created as a way to help Google investors understand the other portions of its business that aren't related to search advertising, where it derives billions of dollars in revenue every quarter. Back in 1998, Google was a search engine that trumped its rivals – including big companies like AOL and Yahoo – by indexing the web more effectively, drawing the best results to the top. Indexing these pages, which revolves around the process of seeing how many in- or out-links there are, requires a lot of computing power which made Google one of the first large-scale cloud computing businesses. Data centre empire Google currently has 15 major data centres located around the world, in places ranging from Jackson County, Alabama, through Eemshaven, in the Netherlands, to Singapore. These centres are essentially banks of powerful computers humming away 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, to deliver searches, pictures, and information to billions of people. What these data centres also provide is the kind of processing power the company would need to run a more-than-successful, fully-featured cloud computing business. At present, Google is currently in third place when it comes to cloud computing. Amazon, a company many consider an online retailer, is top dog, and Microsoft is second, according to research firm Gartner, which regularly analyses the products released by the three companies. Also check out: How Amazon can maintain its momentum with AWS Longer but not stronger This outcome is surprising because Google has been doing cloud computing – the catch-all term for providing a heap of computing power remotely for intensive tasks before sending the data somewhere else – for longer than both Microsoft and Amazon, thanks to its primary business of search. Back in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Amazon was just getting started with and wanted to grow its e-commerce business, and Microsoft was fixated on getting Windows onto every PC in the world. Neither of these goals were related to the cloud in any particular way. Google, on the other hand, was starting to handle a high volume of queries about a huge range of topics, all of which had to be interpreted, the sites ranked, and the results returned in a fraction of a second. Over time, the algorithm has become more complex to cater for individual user needs based on the things they have searched for in the past and what that infers about them. 17 years of doing all of that – and more, especially after the launch of Android in 2008 – means that Google should be way ahead of its rivals in the cloud, but that isn't the case. Victim of its own success In some ways, Google has been a victim of its success elsewhere. Android is now used on around two billion handsets and its search business competes directly with Facebook for around 80% of the dollars spent on advertising online. These two success stories required big teams and commitment. The 'distraction', however, has cost Google a business that will generate Amazon around $10 billion in revenue next year, almost all of which is profit, thanks to the ever-decreasing price of hosting information on supercomputers.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Software Google Maps officially gets Wi-Fi only mode, SD card support Software Google Maps officially gets Wi-Fi only mode, SD card support By Bindu Nair - Talk about a new Wi-Fi only mode in Google Maps has just turned to fact, with the brand finally choosing to make the feature official. The tool is only accessible by Android users as of now and will probably be rolled out to iOS patrons sometime soon. The Wi-Fi only mode is meant to benefit people who face spotty connectivity issues and want to save up on data and battery life. To activate it, all a user has to do is head to the Google Maps Menu followed by Settings. The new alternative will be present within that window as an option. Once the Wi-Fi only mode has been switched on, Google claims that the app will work completely offline. However, a previous report had alleged that a small amount of data could get consumed, though it would be on a much smaller scale than before. Also Read: Google now lets you order food, book a table straight from search results Google’s Wi-Fi only mode doesn’t affect other apps, so users can access cellular data in other applications like they normally would. Moreover, the only way for them to get traffic updates while in the mode would be to switch it off or find the nearest Wi-Fi hotspot. Other than the new Wi-Fi feature, individuals will also be able to store offline maps to their SD card now. A number of people have a limited amount of space in their phone’s internal storage. The new option should come as welcome news to them since they can choose to save their maps to their external card instead of being forced to sacrifice the limited space they have available. Users can start utilizing the option by tapping on Menu, Offline areas, Settings, Storage preferences, Device, and finally SD card. The updated Google Maps is now live and can be downloaded via the Play Store.

But while the social network’s early lead in one of the world’s largest emerging markets has been severely eroded, it’s now preparing to stage a comeback. In 2015, Facebook launched a Free Basics scheme in India that supplied people with free mobile Internet. But there was a catch: only certain websites—Facebook and Wikipedia included—could be accessed without incurring data charges. Indian regulators took a dim view, claiming that the practice—known as “zero rating”—breached the principle of net neutrality. Ultimately, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India banned Free Basics in its existing form. It did, however, suggest that Facebook could continue its efforts if it made the entire Internet, rather than just some parts of it, free to use (something Facebook opted not to do). Meanwhile, Google had already begun plans to roll out an Internet plan of its own in the country. Having announced a collaboration with Indian Railways last year, the company has introduced high-speed Wi-Fi in at least 23 railroad stations. Now, Business Insider reports that Google has two million people using its Wi-Fi hot spots every day. Long-term, it plans to offer access to 10 million people in 100 different stations. The service is currently free, with usage capped at an hour, though it’s expected to eventually become a paid service. Not to be outdone, Facebook is looking to get back in the game as well. The BBC reports that the social network has recently kicked off a new trial that will make it easier for people to get online in rural parts of India. The scheme, called Express Wi-fi, streamlines the process through which people buy data allocations from local Internet service providers. Currently, it allows people to use their purchased data bundles through one of 125 rural Wi-Fi hot spots. It may not be free, but at least it won’t anger regulators in the same way as its first scheme did. Of course, neither company is providing these services selflessly—that much was made clear by Facebook’s initial decision to limit free access to a small number of websites. Instead, both are looking to attract new users in a country containing a relatively untapped market of 1.25 billion people. If Google or Facebook provides your data connection, you’re likely to sign up for its free services, too. The companies can then recoup their investments using their favorite trick of all—advertising.

(AP) -- Residents of a small Massachusetts town are being urged to take caution after a woman who worked for Google in New York City and was visiting her mother was found slain in the woods after going out for a weekend walk or jog. Police found the body of Vanessa Marcotte Sunday night about a half-mile from her mother's home in the town of Princeton, Worcester District Attorney Joseph Early Jr. said Monday. She was reported missing Sunday after she didn't return home. The 27-year-old's death appears to be a homicide, and an autopsy was set to determine the exact cause, Early said. "We have a horrible set of facts; a horrible set of circumstances right now," he said. Police say they don't know if the attack was random. At a Monday news conference, authorities repeatedly urged the public to use caution and report any suspicious activity. "We are concerned about the safety of our town residents and visitors that enter our town," Princeton Police Chief Michele Powers said. "We would ask people to pay attention to their surroundings." Princeton is a town of about 3,500 residents around 40 miles west of Boston. There hasn't been a homicide in the town in the 27 years Powers has worked there, she said. Marcotte worked as an account manager in New York for Google. Marcotte was a 2011 graduate of Boston University, which also mourned her death. Marcotte's death is similar to that of a New York City woman killed while on a run through a Queens park last week. Like Marcotte, 30-year-ol Katrina Vetrano was killed while running alone during daylight hours in a secluded area. There is no indication the deaths are connected. Woman accused of biting officer's ear off held without bail SALEM, Mass. (AP) -- A Massachusetts woman charged with biting off a portion of a rookie police officer's ear during her arrest outside a Salem bar has been held without bail. Emma Wiley pleaded not guilty Monday in to charges including mayhem, assault and battery causing serious bodily injury, assault and battery on a police officer and resisting arrest. Prosecutors say Patrolwoman Jessica Rondinelli responded to reports of a fight outside a city bar at about 1 a.m. Sunday. The police report says while Rondinelli was putting the 19-year-old Wiley in a cruiser, Wiley bit off a piece of the officer's ear. Police: Headquarters windows hit by gunshots, no one hurt NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (AP) -- Authorities in Virginia say someone fired shots at the Newport News Police headquarters building, striking several windows, but no one was injured. Police say in a statement posted online that they received reports of gunshots near police headquarters about 2:30 a.m. today and the building was damaged by several gunshots. Staffers were inside the building at the time, but police say no injuries were reported. Several windows were damaged by the gunfire. Police say the investigation is ongoing. Husband and wife married 63 years die 20 minutes apart PLATTE, S.D. (AP) -- A husband and wife died within 20 minutes of one another side-by-side in a South Dakota nursing home after 63 years of marriage. KSFY-TV reports Henry and Jeanette De Lange died July 31 at Platte Care Center. The couple's son, Lee De Lange, says his 87-year-old mother suffered from Alzheimer's and had been in a nursing home since 2011. He says his 86-year-old father visited her daily before recently entering the same nursing home. Lee De Lange says after his mother died peacefully, he told his father, "mom's gone to heaven. You don't have to fight anymore, you can go too if you want." He says his father looked at his wife, closed his eyes and died minutes after. California wildfire surges, thousands of homes threatened CRESTLINE, Calif. (AP) -- A Southern California wildfire has surged in size and put thousands of homes in potential peril. Smoke plumes roiling from flaming ridges of the San Bernardino Mountains blew all the way to Las Vegas as the blaze on Monday forced the evacuation of hundreds of homes. Firefighters aided by 16 aircraft battled flames that spread across nearly 10 square miles on the northern side of the rugged mountain range east of Los Angeles. People in some 375 homes were ordered to evacuate, authorities said. Residents of about 5,000 more were advised that they may want to evacuate, the San Bernardino County sheriff's office said. The fire, which erupted for an unknown reason Sunday, was just 6 percent contained. On the central coast, meanwhile, California's biggest fire expanded to more than 95 square miles north of scenic Big Sur. An army of more than 5,000 firefighters have contained 50 percent of the 18-day-old blaze. Firefighters set fires to burn out vegetation between the main body of the fire and prepared control lines. Long-suffering residents of Palo Colorado who had been under evacuation orders since late July were finally being allowed to return. Some evacuation orders remained in place, while others were reduced to warnings. Five state parks on Highway 1 between San Francisco and Los Angeles remained closed. The fire, which has destroyed 57 homes, damaged three others and led to the death of a bulldozer operator in an accident, was caused by an illegal campfire.       Comments made about this article - 0 Total Comment on this article Title: Comments: Your Name: (optional - shown on website) Advertisement Subscribe to The Recorder   E-Edition 11/23/2016 Click here to see and download more print issues The Recorder Sports Schedule Most Popular Area high school sports calendar Monday, November 21, 2016 Volunteers to cook up holiday spirit in city with meal delivery Saturday, November 19, 2016 Experienced core will be key for Northville Friday, November 18, 2016 Mayfield returns four starters; also has talented 6-foot-5 eighth grader in the mix Tuesday, November 22, 2016 Fulton County supervisors give approval to $97M draft budget Friday, November 18, 2016 From The Recorder Archives Saturday, November 19, 2016 Thomas to replace Cramer as undersheriff Saturday, November 19, 2016 Sophie Malkowicz Friday, November 18, 2016 City gun buyback yields less, but still viewed as a success Thursday, November 17, 2016 Police report Friday, November 18, 2016 Isabel faces Nelson for county legislature District 8 seat (1) Jury convicts Thomas Mair of murdering UK lawmaker Jo Cox (0) Oh please, not another gratitude list (0) The News in Brief (0) University police officer shot in head (0) Airstrike hits bridge, disrupting IS supply lines (0) Trump taps Gov.

November 23, 2016 All services normal Google Cloud Status Dashboard Incidents Google Compute Engine Google Cloud Status Dashboard This page provides status information on the services that are part of Google Cloud Platform. Check back here to view the current status of the services listed below. For additional information on these services, please visit cloud.google.com. Google Compute Engine Incident #16015 Networking issue with Google Compute Engine services Incident began at 2016-08-05 00:54 and ended at 2016-08-05 02:40 (all times are US/Pacific). Date Time Description Aug 09, 2016 07:21 SUMMARY: On Friday 5 August 2016, some Google Cloud Platform customers experienced increased network latency and packet loss to Google Compute Engine (GCE), Cloud VPN, Cloud Router and Cloud SQL, for a duration of 99 minutes. If you were affected by this issue, we apologize. We intend to provide a higher level reliability than this, and we are working to learn from this issue to make that a reality. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF IMPACT: On Friday 5th August 2016 from 00:55 to 02:34 PDT a number of services were disrupted: Some Google Compute Engine TCP and UDP traffic had elevated latency. Most ICMP, ESP, AH and SCTP traffic inbound from outside the Google network was silently dropped, resulting in existing connections being dropped and new connections timing out on connect. Most Google Cloud SQL first generation connections from sources external to Google failed with a connection timeout. Cloud SQL second generation connections may have seen higher latency but not failure. Google Cloud VPN tunnels remained connected, however there was complete packet loss for data through the majority of tunnels. As Cloud Router BGP sessions traverse Cloud VPN, all sessions were dropped. All other traffic was unaffected, including internal connections between Google services and services provided via HTTP APIs. ROOT CAUSE: While removing a faulty router from service, a new procedure for diverting traffic from the router was used. This procedure applied a new configuration that resulted in announcing some Google Cloud Platform IP addresses from a single point of presence in the southwestern US. As these announcements were highly specific they took precedence over the normal routes to Google's network and caused a substantial proportion of traffic for the affected network ranges to be directed to this one point of presence. This misrouting directly caused the additional latency some customers experienced. Additionally this misconfiguration sent affected traffic to next-generation infrastructure that was undergoing testing. This new infrastructure was not yet configured to handle Cloud Platform traffic and applied an overly-restrictive packet filter. This blocked traffic on the affected IP addresses that was routed through the affected point of presence to Cloud VPN, Cloud Router, Cloud SQL first generation and GCE on protocols other than TCP and UDP. REMEDIATION AND PREVENTION: Mitigation began at 02:04 PDT when Google engineers reverted the network infrastructure change that caused this issue, and all traffic routing was back to normal by 02:34. The system involved was made safe against recurrences by fixing the erroneous configuration. This includes changes to BGP filtering to prevent this class of incorrect announcements. We are implementing additional integration tests for our routing policies to ensure configuration changes behave as expected before being deployed to production. Furthermore, we are improving our production telemetry external to the Google network to better detect peering issues that slip past our tests. We apologize again for the impact this issue has had on our customers.

From host cities racing to build new infrastructure to networks adding more immersive viewing experiences, the Summer Olympics serve as an impetus for innovation. In Rio, competitors are taking advantage of new gadgets and gear designed to improve their speed, agility and focus. Military-inspired surveillance systems are keeping spectators and support personnel safe. Data and information companies are developing new ways to make it easier for fans to follow the events from anywhere. Related: Why Riding the #Rio2016 Wave Could Land Your Business in Legal Trouble Here are 12 solutions that aim to make the 17-day event run more smoothly and elevate athletes to the top of their game -- and the number-one step on the podium. 1 / 12 Nike 1. Nike AeroBlades Since the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Nike has been outfitting track and field athletes with gear designed to make them more aerodynamic. This year in Rio, the company’s solution is, of all things, spiky tape. Nike’s Sports Research Lab has long been developing texturized gear for runners to help them reduce drag, but its newest invention is AeroBlades, which will make their first Olympic appearance in Rio. Nike’s AeroBlades are “formed nodes” that look like tiny hooks or spikes and reduce wind resistance by influencing the movement of air around athletes. The sports brand has produced leg and arm sleeves covered in AeroBlades, along with adhesive patches. Related: Olympic Athletes Turn to Crowdfunding for Travel Expenses, Training Gear and a Ticket to Their Dreams in RioTo test the drag-reducing performance and determine where patches should be placed on the body, Nike stuck AeroBlades to mannequins and placed them in a wind tunnel. They were then able to develop placement instructions for athletes, from sprinters to marathon runners, with the goal of helping them cross the finish line faster. 2 / 12 Hykso 2. Hykso punch-tracking sensors The Canadian boxing team hasn’t won an Olympic medal since 1996, but they hope to improve their record this year after practicing with punch-tracking system technology from Y Combinator startup Hykso. Fighters place lightweight sensors under the tape on their wrists, which send data to a mobile app that counts punches and measures intensity and velocity. The app can even distinguish between the types of punches they throw. The U.S. and Canadian boxing teams have been using Hykso’s technology during sparring and training. Previously, Boxing Canada Head Coach Daniel Trepanier had been using a manual clicker to count all of the punches. Now, he can analyze strategy, recognize previously undetectable punching patterns and help his team adjust them. “Having access to this added layer of knowledge gives our team a huge competitive advantage heading into Rio this summer,” Trepanier said in a Hykso testimonial.Hykso’s tracking systems are currently available for pre-order by the general public. 3 / 12 Solos 3. Solos augmented reality glasses For training cyclists who want to check their vital signs and boost their performance mid-ride, Solos smart glasses provide an augmented reality view of the info, “heads up and hands free.” Solos, an official sponsor of the U.S. Cycling Team, has partnered with the athletes to create a pair of shades that display stats such as cadence, heart rate, speed, distance, duration and more, layered over the road ahead. The glasses, developed by Westborough, Mass.-based Kopin Corporation, are designed to be aerodynamic, stylish and comfortable. They also contain a speaker, which delivers an audio feed of the cyclist’s stats, and connect to a mobile interface. While the U.S. Cycling Team has trained with Solos, they won’t be able to wear them during the races in Rio.As of July 12, 2016, Solos had raised $128,179 via Kickstarter, and the company is on-track to ship pairs to non-Olympian backers this fall. The crowdfunding campaign launched on May 25 and reached its goal of $50,000 within 24 hours. 4 / 12 Omega 4. Omega underwater lap counters Watchmaker company Omega has been the official timekeeper for all but three of the Olympic Games since 1932, but this year, it’s expanding its role beyond official data-handling. When swimmers are racing back and forth across the pool, they often have trouble keeping track of the number of laps they’ve completed. To eliminate this distraction and replace the human officials who previously displayed numbers at the pool’s edge, Omega has developed underwater lap counters. Installed at the bottom of each lane, the counters update every time a swimmer touches a pad on the wall. The numbers will be visible to swimmers without requiring them to look up from the pool. They’re designed solely for in-the-moment use by competitors, rather than official timekeeping for the races, Omega clarifies on its website.Omega premiered the lap counters at the FINA World Swimming Championships in Doha, Qatar, in December 2014. In Rio, the devices will be used in the 800-meter and 1500-meter freestyle swimming events, according to Rio2016.com. 5 / 12 Visa 5. Visa payment wearables Visa has teamed up with Brazilian bank Bradesco to create a bracelet that allows spectators at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games to pay for things by waving an arm over a sensor. All 4,000 point-of-sale terminals at Olympic venues are equipped with near-field communication tech that will power these transactions. NFC is the same type of system that powers Apple Pay and Google Pay. In addition, Visa is providing all of the 45 Olympic and Paralympic athletes it sponsors with wearable rings they can use to make purchases in the same manner. The rings are water resistant to depths of up to 50 meters, and they don’t contain a battery or require recharging, according to Visa. 6 / 12 Logos Technologies 6. Logos Technologies surveillance balloons To keep athletes and spectators safe, Rio has spent $8 million on a contract with Logos Technologies to provide aerial surveillance. While Logos originally developed its technology for the U.S. Department of Defense, this is the first large-scale civilian application for its sophisticated imaging system, Simera. Logos has installed four 40-pound balloons, tethered to the ground, each with 13 high-resolution cameras affixed to them. All cameras combined are capable of capturing three photos per second of the surrounding area, with each balloon covering about 55 square miles, according to Sport Techie.   Operators can zoom in on an unlimited number of areas, connect to security cameras on the ground and communicate with law enforcement officers. While the cameras lack facial recognition technology, the system does archive video so operators can retrace a suspicious person’s path.Despite privacy concerns, Simera’s test-run at Rio could pave the way for Logos to provide surveillance at more large-scale events and commercial areas in the future. 7 / 12 ImageSat International 7. ImageSat International satellite security Security systems are also stationed outside the Earth’s atmosphere for Rio. The Eros-B satellite, owned and operated by Israeli company ImageSat International, is providing detailed inspections of Rio de Janeiro during both the Olympic and Paralympic Games. The Eros-B has been in low Earth orbit since 2006, taking pictures of the Earth’s surface. But now the commercial satellite, which can capture high-resolution images of up to one and a half feet in an area of approximately 31 miles, is helping to identify people, cars and even goods during the games, according to Jewish Telegraphic Agency.Previously, the Eros-B has been used for disaster, urban, maritime and military monitoring. 8 / 12 Google 8. Google for the Games When you enter an Olympics-related query, Google will display a chart featuring a variety of information about the games at the top of your search results. You can click through to get information about particular sports or countries, as well as find TV schedules and medal wins. In addition to the usual bio that appears in the right sidebar when you search for a person, Google has prepared special overview pages for Olympians. If this system isn’t convenient enough, you can also register to get automatic updates through the Google mobile app. As for Google’s other services, it’s partnered with official broadcasters for YouTube streaming in more than 60 countries. And thanks to advances in mobile livestreaming, 15 YouTube curators will also be broadcasting from their phones.To better represent Rio de Janeiro, Google Maps has added its previously absent working-class favela neighborhoods --including several businesses within them -- and produced a 360-degree virtual tour of the city for people around the globe to explore. 9 / 12 Pool | Getty Images 9. Getty Images curation and sharing Getty Images has launched a new platform specially designed for the Olympics -- and for the everyday user. The Rio 2016 Olympic Games platform organizes the Getty library, which contains more than 200 million images, into multiple searchable galleries. The platform also includes pages highlighting individual athletes, sports and countries, as well as an archive section featuring photos from 1896, the year of the first modern games. A team of more than 120 Getty photographers is present in Rio, and Getty expects them to gather more than 1.5 million images over the course of the Olympics. Many of them are being taken with 360-degree cameras and both overhead and underwater robotic cameras. The images will appear live on the Getty website within two minutes from the moment of capture, according to the service. Getty has also improved the ease with which its users can share the images on social media in close to real time.   Beyond these features, Getty’s iOS and Android apps now support 360-degree images and Google Cardboard, according to Getty. 10 / 12 Gabriel Grams | Getty Images 10.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Leak  ⋮  Mobile Download HTC Nexus S1 And M1 Wallpapers Here; Pair Rumored To Feature Fingerprint Gesture Recognition By Ramish Zafar Posted Aug 7, 2016 26Shares Share Tweet Submit The launch of the Galaxy Note 7 now leaves us with a handful of devices for this year. The iPhone 7, HTC Nexus M1 and HTC Nexus S1 will be launched this year. Today, it’s once again the HTC Nexus lineup’s turn with some wallpaper and feature leaks. Head below, if you’re eager to download Nexus wallpapers and find out more about the devices. HTC Nexus S1 And M1 See Wallpapers Leak Along Information Of A New Feature Google’s taken a solid approach with the Nexus lineup over the past couple of years. Last year’s Nexus 6P and 5X were solid devices. Both of them managed to target their respective brackets efficiently. This year, we’re once again expecting two smartphones from Google’s end. Both will be manufactured by HTC, unlike last year’s devices. Design wise, there are some rather interesting images floating out there as well. Dubbed as the Nexus Sailfish and Nexus Marlin, the pair will once again target two performance brackets. Information so far suggests that the Nexus S1 will be featuring a Snapdragon 820 processor. This should be complemented with 4GB of RAM. Display for the device might stand at 1080×1920. Now, some more information and wallpapers have surfaced for the smartphones. You can take a look below at the leaked images. There’s a link at the bottom of this post from where you can get them uncompressed. Alongside today’s wallpapers, some details about the pair’s fingerprint sensor have also surfaced. While the phone’s will once again feature fingerprint recognition on the back, this time you’ll be able to use it differently. Sources now claim that the HTC Nexus’ fingerprint sensor will allow for gesture recognition as well. You can take a better look at it in the image below. With the Nexus S1 and M1 you will be able to check your notifications by simply swiping on the sensor. This should make for some good intuitive usage, though it won’t be the first time such an option appears on an Android. There’s still no information on when Google will launch this year’s Nexus pair. In fact, save a couple of benchmark and other leaks, we’re yet to see any live images or details for the devices. There do seem to be some unconventional design and color options this year. Nevertheless, nothing’s clear so far. More information should surface in the future, especially if past trends are to continue. We’ll be on the look out for it. Till then, stay tuned and let us know what you think in the comments section below.

Google tests a more personalized version of its virtual assistant, Google Now Posted Aug 9, 2016 by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story Pingpad hitches wagon to Slack with new collaboration tool aimed at enterprise Google Now, the intelligent personal assistant bundled into Android and Google’s search application, is already adept at bringing you the information you need at the right time, whether that’s traffic alerts, event reminders, sports scores, stock updates, weather, flight info, and much more. But one area where Google Now falls a little short is in customizing the assistant more precisely to your needs. Today, this is done via a series of on/off toggle switches in the app’s settings, which is a bit hidden, as well as by tapping on individual items where you can tell the app you’re “not interested” in that card, or that news source. However, a new feature in the works called “Explore Interests” appears it will give users more control over what sort of information Google will track on your behalf, and will make it easier to tell Google exactly what sort of information you want to hear more about. The feature was spotted in the wild by the blog Android Police, which claimed it may be rolling out slowly. However, a Google spokesperson confirmed “Interests” is an experiment that the company is testing with the look-and-feel of the product, adding that Google has nothing to announce at this time. nexus2cee_1459069626628297583-account_id1 nexus2cee_5793178604056047480-account_id1 nexus2cee_ExInHero  View Slideshow Previous Next Exit With “Explore Interests,” Google is offering a different way to track news and other topics, beyond allowing Google to passively determine this information based on things like search history or location. The app informs users they can “pick teams, bands, movies, and more” and a click-through takes them to a screen where there are colorful tiles for sections like “Sports,” “TV,” “Movies,” “Musicians,” “People,” “Stocks,” and more. As you dive into each section, you can browse through cards of individual items across a number of subcategories, then click plus (+) signs to add the item to the list of things you’re tracking. For example, under the “TV” categories, there’s a subsection of just “Reality” TV shows, with items like “The Voice,” “American Idol,” “The Bachelor,” and others available to track with just a tap. Meanwhile, the “People” section may show you cards for politicians like Clinton and Trump, as well as athletes, actors and other figures. As you browse through these sections, you can also see which topics are “Popular in Your Area,” which gives the Google Now interests feature a bit of local flair. The idea of using Google to track very specific information is something that’s been around for ages, dating back to the launch of Google Alerts. A number of startups also arrived over the years, trying to best the Google Alerts experience, but most have been focused on the “social” mentions space. Google Now’s (hopefully) forthcoming “Interests” section will instead offer a similar tracking ability, but bundle it into the app that users launch daily. Being able to better customize the Google Now assistant is something that comes at a critical time for the company, as Apple’s Siri is making its way onto Mac in addition to iOS and Apple TV, Cortana is bundled into Windows and can’t be entirely shut off, and Amazon’s Alexa platform is making strong headway into the customer’s home through its Echo speaker and other devices. Google, therefore, is challenged to not only make its assistant practical and proactive, in terms of offering things you need to know – like when to leave for your meeting – but in making it a tool that tracks those things you want to know about, too.

Google Fiber gets put on hold in San Jose 0 Internet Services by Ry Crist August 9, 2016 6:55 AM PDT @rycrist Up Next Pokemon Go tracking finally goes live and actually works Google Fiber isn't at San Jose's doorstep.Photo by Google Google Fiber announced more than a year ago that it was exploring ways to bring its super-speedy internet service to San Jose, California. Now, months after city officials approved the major construction needed to make it happen, the subsidiary of Google parent company Alphabet is hesitating. According to a report Tuesday in the San Jose Mercury News, officials with Google Fiber informed at least two cities in the Silicon Valley region that they're putting the rollout on hold to explore cheaper alternatives. Those alternatives likely include a stronger focus on aerial installation, especially coming after Google Fiber's purchase of the point-to-point internet service provider Webpass in June. Webpass uses a combination of rooftop wireless networks connected to high-speed fiber connections, and promises to deliver speeds of up to 1 gigbit per second, all at a fraction of the time and cost commitment that comes with building a traditional fiber-based network. Webpass serves business clients in cities like San Francisco and New York. Google Fiber is already up and running in seven US cities, with several more listed as "upcoming" or "potential" expansion sites. San Jose area officials said that Google has assured them that the company remains committed to the deployment, the Mercury News reported, though the delay could push back rollout at least six months. "We're continuing to work with city leaders to explore the possibility of bringing Google Fiber to the South Bay area," a Google spokesperson told CNET. "This means deploying the latest technologies in alignment with our product roadmap, while understanding local considerations and challenges, which takes time. The cities of San Jose, Mountain View, Palo Alto, Santa Clara, and Sunnyvale have been great partners and we're thankful for the hard work that city leaders continue to do along the way."

Over on Apple devices, the game was downloaded more times in its first week than any app that came before it. The suddenly vast scale of Pokemon Go adoption is matched by the game’s aggressive use of personal information. Unlike, say, Twitter, Facebook, or Netflix, the app requires uninterrupted use of your location and camera — a “trove of sensitive user data,” as one privacy watchdog put it in a concerned letter to federal regulators. All the more alarming, then, that Pokemon Go is run by a man whose team literally drove one of the greatest privacy debacles of the internet era, in which Google vehicles, in the course of photographing neighborhoods for the Street View feature of the company’s online maps, secretly copied digital traffic from home networks, scooping up passwords, email messages, medical records, financial information, and audio and video files. Before Niantic Labs CEO John Hanke was the man behind an unfathomably popular smartphone goldmine, he ran Google’s Geo division, responsible for nearly everything locational at a time when the search company was turning into much more, expanding away from cataloging the web and towards cataloging every city block on the planet. Hanke landed at Google after his wildly popular (and admittedly very neat) CIA-funded company Keyhole, which collected geographic imagery, was acquired in 2004 and relaunched as Google Earth in 2005. By 2007, Hanke was running basically everything at Google that involved a map. In a 2007 Wired profile, (“Google Maps Is Changing the Way We See the World”) Hanke was lauded as a pioneer (“Led by John Hanke, Google Earth and Google Maps are delivering cartography tools to the masses”) and deified, appearing in photo with an enormous globe across his shoulders. It was an exciting time for Google. Google Maps had become indispensable, dumping the likes of MapQuest into obsolescence, and Google had great ambitions for turning surroundings into revenue. But before Google could sell the world back to its inhabitants, it needed to digitize it; around the world, fleets of sensor-laden Google cars roamed cities, back roads, and highways, snapping photos of buildings, posts, trees, and other features. Each vehicle was labeled a Street View Car by Google, a reference to the Street View feature their pictures enabled on Google Maps. Google shared Street View imagery widely via an application programming interface, or API, and among the apps that owe a debt of gratitude to Street View Cars is Pokemon Go. Then, in April 2010, Germany’s data protection commissioner announced that Google vehicles had been illegally collecting Wi-Fi data. Further regulatory scrutiny and corroborating news reports eked out the truth: As they drove, Street View Cars were swallowing up traffic from unencrypted wireless networks. Germany’s federal privacy czar, Peter Schaar, said he was “horrified” and “appalled.” It eventually emerged that, in the U.S. alone, this collection went on for more than two years. The scandal, referred to as the “Wi-Spy” case as it was unfolding, resulted in: Findings that Wi-Fi traffic collection was illegal by authorities in the United Kingdom, France, Canada, South Korea, and New Zealand. A bruising Federal Communications Commission investigation, which followed a director’s comment that Google’s activity “clearly infringes on consumer privacy” and which resulted in a $25,000 fine. A Department of Justice wiretapping investigation. A federal class-action case against Google, ongoing to this day, in which a district and appeals court have both ruled, against the company’s arguments, that the sort of data Google accessed is protected from interception under the U.S. Wiretap Act. (The Supreme Court has declined to hear Google’s appeal.) Lawsuits brought by authorities in Spain. Regulator intervention in Italy and Hungary. And a government investigation in Germany. (The Electronic Privacy Information Center, an advocacy group and vocal critic of Google’s during the Street View scandal, has a good overview of these actions.) Hanke, through a spokesperson, denied any knowledge of the Wi-Fi collection at the time it was happening, pinning blame on Google’s mobile division. But a unit within his division, not mobile, was the focus of the largest investigation into the matter by U.S. regulators, and it was his division whose vehicles did the actual collection. The way Wi-Fi traffic was intercepted under Hanke’s nose should alarm people who use, or whose children use, Pokemon Go. Google itself tried to escape responsibility as the scandal unfolded, dismissing concerns, rebuffing investigators, and evincing the sort of hubris and arrogance for which the engineer-dominated company has been repeatedly criticized. In a blog post published at the very beginning of the scandal, Google denied any wrongdoing, saying it had copied no traffic from inside Wi-Fi networks, but rather gleaned “information that identifies the network and how that network operates,” like the name of your router, which you assume to be public anyway. This narrative was short lived: Two weeks later, as international scrutiny increased, Google shifted from outright denial to scapegoat tactics, admitting it had copied traffic, but only “mistakenly” and mostly in “fragments.” Google attempted, amazingly, to divert blame from the cars operating on behalf of Hanke’s operation onto one single unnamed rogue “engineer working on an experimental WiFi project.” A vice president from Hanke’s Geo division two months later acknowledged in a blog post that “serious mistakes were made in the collection of WiFi payload data, and we have worked to quickly rectify them … the WiFi data collection equipment has been removed from our cars.” But Google continued to call the traffic collection a mistake. Then, three months after that, yet another official post repeated that the collection was “mistaken” but only specifically acknowledged collecting emails, URLs, and passwords.  Only after repeated and increasingly vociferous inquiries from the FCC, which was frustrated that Google had “deliberately impeded and delayed” its investigation, did the company reveal the truth, which was summarized in blunt 2012 commission report. Far from acting on his own, the supposedly rogue “Engineer Doe” (as the report referred to him) had collaborated on and discussed openly his “piece of code” with several other Google engineers, including superiors. In fact, he’d tried to warn his colleagues, sending his software code and a design document to the leaders of the Street View project, who in turn forwarded it to the entire Street View team. “The design document,” the FCC wrote, “identified ‘Privacy Considerations’  and recommended review by counsel, but that never occurred.” This design overview stated quite plainly that “a typical concern [with the project] might be that we are logging user traffic with sufficient data to precisely triangulate their position at a given time, along with information about what they were doing.” Warnings don’t come clearer than that. The FCC report went on to show that while planning the Wi-Fi collection project, on “at least two” occasions, “Engineer Doe specifically informed colleagues that Street View cars were collecting payload data,” and even shared portions of the collected personal traffic. In a 2008 email, one of these colleagues, “a senior manager of the Street View project,” called Engineer Doe’s analysis of 300 million Wi-Fi traffic packets containing 32,000 web addresses “interesting” and asked, “Are you saying that these are URLs that you sniffed out of Wifi packets that we recorded while driving?” The engineer’s reply confirmed this to be the case: “The data was collected during daytime when most traffic is at work (and likely encrypted). … I don’t think the numbers are high enpugh [sic] for a good sample.” Data turned over to European regulators and reviewed by the FCC further showed that essentially all types of computer data were collected, including information related to online dating and sexual preferences. In the end, the unencrypted internet habits of possibly hundreds of thousands of people were secretly scraped up and stored while the cars were carrying out their publicly stated mission of collecting the locations of wireless networks. Google’s cars weren’t just sniffing out the names of wireless routers, but also sucking down all of the unprotected information being sent to and from those routers as the vehicles drove by, including visited websites, search queries, and emails. Of course, even a brief sample of a person’s internet traffic can reveal a great deal that they would prefer remain between them and the computer.  The camera of a German Google Street View car looms over the car next to the Google logo at the Google stand at the CeBIT Technology Fair on March 3, 2010 in Hannover, Germany. Photo: Sean Gallup/Getty Images All of this happened while John Hanke led the Geo division, including Street View and Maps, as vice president for product management. Google eventually imposed a set of privacy reforms, but it’s unclear, even before those changes, why no one intervened when engineers spoke openly about collecting the internet traffic of strangers. It may have had to do with the culture inside Google; in a 2009 interview with The Times of London, a year before the scandal began, Hanke said: “As a company we may not make 100% of everybody happy in all situations but I don’t think you can live your life as an individual or as a company not wanting to step on anybody’s toes. We have to chart a course between the benefit that can come from something and adhering to social mores and the law.” Soon after the FCC published its findings, the New York Times identified “Engineer Doe” as Marius Milner, a security researcher and well-known figure in the hacker community. Milner at the time declined to elaborate on his role in the data fiasco, saying only that Google’s claim that he acted alone “requires putting a lot of dots together.” Milner confirmed to The Intercept that he still works at Google, meaning the rogue engineer outlasted John Hanke by four years, but said he “never met him.” Milner, as it happens, does have his own link to Pokemon Go: He and Hanke co-authored with three others a patent held by Niantic on a “System and Method for Transporting Virtual Objects in a Parallel Reality Game.” Milner told me that the patent stemmed from “hatching some ideas with a personal friend that was one of the other co-authors” and that he never discussed the patent with Hanke. It’s worth noting that Google filed the patent in 2012, two years after the company scapegoated Milner as a supposedly lone, rogue engineer. It was granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in 2015, when it was assigned to Niantic, then a little-known augmented reality startup. Hanke had begun Niantic inside Google in 2010 as an autonomous business unit, according to news reports, before the unit was spun off late last year to free Niantic up to work with a wider variety of partners. Google and Nintendo joined to put $20 million into the company, though the exact size of Google’s stake remains unclear. As Niantic left Google, it took the Milner-Hanke patent with it. The patent discusses, at length, how a game such as Pokemon Go could be used to collect real-world data from a player without them knowing it: The game objective can be directly linked with a data collection activity. An exemplary game objective directly linked with data collection activity can include a task that involves acquiring information about the real world and providing this information as a condition for completion of the game objective.” The patent also cites, for illustrative purposes, an academic paper from The International Journal of Virtual Reality, “Playful Geospatial Data Acquisition by Location-Based Gaming Communities” by Sebastian Matyas, which includes as its introduction the following paragraph: “To our opinion, the real challenge lies in motivating the user to provide the data constantly, even after the exciting appeal of technological innovation at the beginning wears off. The data acquisition process should be entertaining for a possible contributor to engage him in the long run. We convince that entertainment and fun are an important design aspect of such data collecting services.” When asked if he had worked with Hanke’s Street View team, as stated throughout the FCC report, Milner said he was unable to comment. Google did not respond to a request for comment. Hanke, through a spokesperson, more explicitly distanced himself from the controversy. A Niantic representative communicating on his behalf said “he was not the boss of what happened” and that he had no prior knowledge of the wireless eavesdropping, which, the spokesperson said, was ultimately the fault of Google’s mobile division, even though it was conducted via Street View Cars operating on behalf of Hanke’s division. The FCC’s report on the Wi-Spy scandal is squarely focused on Hanke’s Street View team and never mentions the mobile team. It also offers one possible explanation for how Hanke can claim he had no knowledge of the eavesdropping: Despite Milner’s (or “Engineer Doe’s”) written and verbal attempts to keep Street View leadership in the loop about the wireless data collection he was doing, he was often simply ignored. The FCC said, “in interviews and declarations, managers of the Street View project and other Google employees who worked on the project told the Bureau they did not read Engineer Doe’s design document” even though it was sent to the entire Street View team. The confusion about responsibility for Milner’s actions may stem from the fact that he was actually working for Google’s YouTube at the time — which is not part of either Hanke’s Geo division or the mobile team — and created his Wi-Fi collector as a side project under Google’s “20% time” policy. While Google has said wireless collection was initiated by “our mobile team,” it made clear in the same blog post that said team was not in control of Milner’s actions, since “project leaders did not want, and had no intention of using, payload data.” Meanwhile, the data collected by Milner’s software, about the names and location of wireless access points, was deployed on Street View Cars (working on behalf of Hanke’s divsion) and was used for helping pedestrians and drivers locate themselves on the mobile version of Google Maps (part of Hanke’s division) and on Google’s mobile operating system Android (a different division). In a post on the company’s “Official Blog” about the matter, Google mentioned both Google Maps (again, part of Hanke’s division) and the mobile team (not part of Hanke’s division) as recipients of data from Milner (who worked for neither). Clearly, no one at Google is eager to claim Wi-Spy as their own, Hanke included. Today, given the spread of Pokemon Go and sensitivity of the data it accesses, it’s less important that Hanke now blames the mobile team for the Wi-Spy scandal than that his division, unwittingly or not, became the vehicle — or vehicles, to be precise — through which one engineer was able to collect massive amounts of hugely sensitive data, while managers and engineers from Hanke’s division repeatedly ignored explicit warnings, written and verbal, about what was going on from that engineer, according to the most thorough published investigation of the matter by a U.S. government entity. Electronic Privacy Information Center, the privacy watchdog, is already putting pressure on Niantic and its CEO. In a letter to the FTC sent this month, EPIC argued that “history suggests Niantic will continue to disregard consumer privacy and security, which increases the need for close FTC scrutiny as Niantic’s popularity – and trove of sensitive user data – continues to grow,” and added that “given the prior history of Google Street View, there is little reason to trust the assurance regarding the current state of Niantic’s data collection practices.” Reached via phone, EPIC Consumer Protection Counsel Claire Gartland stressed to me that the Street View scandal should make any Pokemon Go player “think twice about whether you can take them at their word” and that the FTC should “pay closer attention to this and make sure that [Niantic’s] data collection practices are on the up and up.” It’s so important to make sure Niantic’s collection practices are “on the up and up” because we already know that they are vast. Pokemon Go’s official privacy policy makes this clear: We collect and store information about your (or your authorized child’s) location when you (or your authorized child) use our App and take game actions that use the location services made available through your (or your authorized child’s) device’s mobile operating system, which makes use of cell/mobile tower triangulation, wifi triangulation, and/or GPS. You understand and agree that by using our App you (or your authorized child) will be transmitting your (or your authorized child’s) device location to us and some of that location information, along with your (or your authorized child’s) user name, may be shared through the App… We collect certain information that your (or your authorized child’s) mobile device sends when you (or your authorized child) use our Services, like a device identifier, user settings, and the operating system of your (or your authorized child’s) device, as well as information about your use of our Services while using the mobile device. Niantic reserves the right to share some of the information it collects, in what it claims is a “non-identifying” form, with third parties “for research and analysis, demographic profiling, and other similar purposes.” This would be a lot of sensitive information to entrust even to a CEO with a good record of respecting the privacy of strangers. And in fact, in the very first week of Pokemon Go’s release, Niantic caused a brief privacy scare when it was discovered that the app asked for far broader access to users’ Google accounts than was necessary. The company responded almost immediately: “We recently discovered that the Pokémon Go account creation process on iOS erroneously requests full access permission for the user’s Google account. … Google has verified that no other information has been received or accessed by Pokémon Go or Niantic.” All that was missing was a rogue engineer.

NYC Google manager killed on jog in Massachusetts The charred, naked corpse of a Manhattan-based Google manager was found in a wooded area outside Boston hours after she left her parents’ home for a run, authorities said Monday. Vanessa Marcotte, 27, was visiting her mom in Princeton, Mass., on Sunday, when she began her run around 1 p.m. and never came back, according to WCVB-TV. Around 8:20 p.m., police dogs found her body, with her hands, feet and part of her head burned, a source told the station. “We have a horrible set of facts, horrible circumstance,” said Worcester County District Attorney Joseph Early Jr. “We cannot tell whether or not this was a random act at this point.” It’s the first homicide in Princeton in nearly 30 years, according to Police Chief Michelle Powers. No arrests had been made as of Monday evening. Vanessa MarcottePhoto: Instagram Marcotte, who had worked at Google for a year-and-a-half, was based at the firm’s offices in Chelsea. “Vanessa Marcotte was a much-loved member of the Google team, working in our New York office for the last year-and-a-half, and known for her ubiquitous smile, passion for volunteer work, and love of Boston sports,” a Google representative said. “We are deeply shocked and saddened, and our thoughts are with her family and friends.” Marcotte grew up in Leominster, Mass., and graduated from Boston University in 2011 with a BA in communications. She then worked at the printed-marketing firm Vistaprint for two years before joining Google, WCVB reports. Larry Kim, her former boss at the Boston-based marketing firm WordStream, was heartbroken. “I am just in complete disbelief. She was a wonderful young woman and very ambitious and had a brilliant career cut short,” Kim told the Boston Globe. Boston University spokesman Colin Riley said school officials feel “terrible for her family and friends.” “They’re in our thoughts and prayers,” he said.

TIME U.S. Crime Google Employee Found Dead Was Stripped and Burned, Reports Say Naja Rayne and Stephanie Petit / People Aug. 9, 2016 SHARE Vanessa Marcotte, 27, disappeared during a jog A 27-year-old Google employee who was found dead in the woods on Sunday had been stripped naked and partially burned, according to multiple reports. Vanessa Marcotte, who lived and worked in New York City, was visiting her mother in Princeton, Massachusetts – a rural town about an hour west of Boston – when she disappeared during a Sunday jog, CBS Boston reports. Authorities reportedly located her naked body with burns to the face, hands and feet Sunday evening about a half mile from her mother’s home, CBS Boston reports, citing law enforcement sources. The Worcester Telegram & Gazette and WCVB also quoted police sources as saying that Marcotte’s body was found stripped and damaged. “People should be concerned,” Worcester District Attorney Joseph Early Jr. said Monday, CBS Boston. Early announced the death is being investigated as a homicide based on evidence at the scene. “I must stress that we do not know if this is a random act,” he said. “We’re asking the residents of Princeton to use an abundance of caution.” According to the WCVB, police were focusing their investigation on the hours of 1 p.m., when she first left her mother’s home, and 4 p.m. Marcotte’s body was reportedly found at 8:20 p.m. Investigators were also looking into the possibility of sexual assault, the The Boston Globe reports. The Google team mourned the loss of the Boston University graduate. “Vanessa Marcotte was a much loved member of the Google team, working in our New York office for the last year and a half, and known for her ubiquitous smile, passion for volunteer work, and love of Boston sports,” a spokesperson for Google said in a written statement, according to CBS Boston. “We are deeply shocked and saddened, and our thoughts are with her family and friends.” In addition to warning residents to be vigilant, police are also asking for the public’s help with the case and are urging anyone with information to contact them at 508-453-7589. Marcotte’s death comes less than a week after a 30-year-old woman was strangled to death during a run in Queens, New York. Karina Vetrano’s father called police she didn’t return from her daily jog through Gateway National Park, which is a few blocks from her home. He went out with police and discovered her body 15 feet from the jogging trail. Authorities said there’s evidence to suggest Vertrano was sexually assaulted before being strangled to death.

He'd been toiling away on his exercise bike for half an hour a day for years, and things were beginning to get tedious. "I'd been day dreaming for a while about the possibility of using VR to make it a bit more fun," Puzey told The Verge by email. "And now of course the technology has arrived to make it happen." His solution? Hooking a Galaxy Gear up to Google Street View and cycling the length of the UK — 1,500 kilometers from Land's End to John o' Groats — all from the comfort of his front room. Puzey has been documenting his travels on his blog, Cycle VR, updating the site with edited video highlights of every 100 kilometers. He says he's been lengthening the amount of time he dedicates to the journey, and reckons he'll be finished in around 50 days. cycling by Street View reveals the simplicity of Google's data One of the most interesting things, he says, has been navigating what is a highly constrained 3D world. "The single biggest problem with the Street View data is the high compression on the depth information," says Puzey, with Google storing a limited number of planes to represent complex scenes. "Some things, like buildings, fit very well to this model and look quite solid, but things like trees and hedges and anything lumpy often just looks a mess. I've also seen things like squashed bugs on the Google camera, bad colors in some scenes and strange black 'sink holes'. However, even with those problems it still feels like I'm there." So much so, that nausea can be a problem, especially when he's navigating complex routes — like roundabouts — that have been squashed into only a few layers of depth. "The problem [is that I'm] telling the 'bike' in VR to face in the direction of the path it was moving along," says Puzey. "Then I had a breakthrough and realized if I make it face about 5 meters ahead of where I was it made an enormous improvement." Puzey says he had to develop his own app to download the 3D data from Street View and make it viewable in the VR headset, but other than that, the setup was simple. He just taped a Bluetooth cadence monitor to his bike to measure its RPM, and sends this data to the Gear VR as instructions to advance through his route. "I find I have to spend quite a bit of time nursing my app through as it gets stuck or crashes," he adds. And is he planning on taking any other cycle trips in the future? Puzey says 1,500 kilometers is enough to be going on with for now, but that he's always liked the idea of visiting Japan, and might take a trip there in the future. "Using Street View I can visit pretty much anywhere."

Google Maps users in Ireland will be able to order a Hailo through the Ride Services Tab, which is positioned alongside the existing ‘walking’, ‘car’, ‘bike’ and ‘transit’ options in the Google Maps user interface. The new ordering function will allow users of Google Maps on iOS and Android devices to see the estimated availability, price, and travel time to the destination they have requested directions for in Google Maps. ‘The addition of Hailo to Google Maps in Ireland recognises the key role licensed taxis play as part of Ireland’s transport infrastructure’ – TIM ARNOLD, HAILO “Hailo carries 45,000 passengers every day in Ireland, offering customers a convenient, safe and accessible way to order a licensed taxi,” explained Tim Arnold, general manager of Hailo in Ireland. It recently emerged that Hailo has sold 60pc of its stock to car giant Daimler and will rebrand to become MyTaxi. Hail a Hailo “The addition of the Hailo ordering function to Google Maps is a great way to make the Hailo customer journey even more convenient,” said Arnold. Hailo is a Google Global Ride Service Partner, and the Hailo ordering function has been available to customers in the UK and Spain since March. “Google Maps helps millions of people navigate their way around the world,” Arnold added. “The addition of Hailo to Google Maps in Ireland recognises the key role licensed taxis play as part of Ireland’s transport infrastructure.” Hailo-branded taxi at Dublin Pride parade image by William Murphy via Flickr/Creative Commons Related: Android, search, Hailo, apps, mapping, Google Maps, iOS Editor John Kennedy is an award-winning technology journalist. editorial@siliconrepublic.com You May Also Like You May Also Like Trending Olympics Google Doodle transforms into a fruity mobile game 5 Aug 20161 Share Hiring Now Informing, entertaining and connecting the world A dynamic and rapidly expanding company Keeps files safe, synced and easy to share Always at the cutting edge of new innovation Gear Circle’s consumer fintech revolution arrives in Ireland and Spain 21 Oct 2016255 Shares Start-ups Start-up of the week: 9th Impact 10 Oct 2016131 Shares SUBSCRIBE TO OUR E-ZINE Sign up to receive weekly alerts bringing the best of Siliconrepublic.com straight to your inbox.

Credit: Google Play More like this Google Play Family Library launches, enabling shared apps, games, movies, and... Google Play Family Library is official, launching in July Five tips to help you get the most out of Google Play Music Video Google Daydream View unboxing: A first look at Google's VR headset At long last, nearly all of your Google Play purchases can be shared with up to five other members of your Android-loving family. The Google Play Family Library comes nearly two years after Apple debuted a similar offering for those on iOS. Its absence on Android has likely been a source of frustration for those who may have had to buy an app twice so their spouse, child, or another family member could also enjoy it. Fortunately Google’s option is a solid one, even if it’s a bit tardy. It offers a fair amount of customization and controls over what gets tossed into the family pool, so you can ensure the little ones don’t aren’t freaked out by a gory battle scene from Game of Thrones.  Getting started You can sign up on the web or inside the Google Play app on your Android phone or tablet. Head to Account > Family and touch the Sign up button. The Google Play family library promises to offer a simple method of sharing purchases. The next step is to choose a credit card that will serve as the payment method for everyone in the family. Google says you’ll get an email for each purchase so you can keep tabs on who is buying what. You’re also able to set up some approval safeguards after the initial setup process so no one goes wild and drains your account on in-app upgrades. Set your content free To eliminate confusion, I recommend adding all eligible purchases. Otherwise you’ll have to hunt and peck through your catalog and share content with the family one at a time. The caveat is this makes everything you’ve bought available, so if there’s a ton of content you don’t want the children to have, then it’ll be best to select it one at a time. Add some or all of your purchases apps, games, movies, TV shows, and books to your family library. You then can invite your family members. Each person must be 13 or older, live in the same country as you, and not be a member of another family. They’ll also need their own Google account.  Unfortunately you can’t create a child account, like you can with Apple’s plan. If you want to use an Android tablet or hand-me-down phone specifically for a child to play with, your best option is to sign in with your own account and follow our guide to make it kid-friendly. Round up the family Now it’s time to select who gets the golden tickets. Your frequent contacts will be at the top of the list, but once you type names Google Play will also autosuggest names from your contacts. Add up to five others to your family. When someone accepts your invite, you’ll get an email notification. Same goes when somebody makes a purchase on your family card. The good news is they can use their own gift or credit card instead, so if you’re sharing your account with other adults you could always gently request they make more expensive purchases on their own. Additionally, you can require your approval before any content or in-app upgrade is purchased. In the Family Manager settings you can customize this for each individual.  Share away Every member of your family will have a new section inside their Play Store that details all the apps that have been added to the family account. All they have to do is select that app, game, movie, TV show, or book and download it. Sharing, not surprisingly, doesn’t apply to in-app purchases. So everyone is on their own to boost their Clash of Clans capabilities. Your family members will be able to enjoy the spoils of your past purchases. There are a few nuances to note, however. If you buy a movie bundle, only the bundle in its entirety gets shared: you can’t pick and choose individual movies.   When you go to buy something else, you’ll see the icon to denote it can be applied to the family library. You can also pull out of the pool things you don’t want, though this can get a little tedious as you have to hunt them down. New apps that can be added to the family library will include the icon. Previous purchases can be opted out by flipping the switch, so your children aren’t freaked out by murderous Vikings. Also, keep in mind you’re not totally limited to Android. Google Play Movies and Play Books have dedicated iOS and browser versions. Play Movies of course works well on Android TV and Chromecast, though you’ll need to use AirPlay with an Apple TV. Take time to poke around so you can make it fit your own group. From the settings you can also delete someone from the family if they’ve aged out of your household or have just been plain naughty.

The Alcatel Idol 4S is one of those devices. While mid-range phones typically come with standard HD displays and paltry amounts of RAM, the Idol 4S has a 5.5-inch Quad HD panel, 3GB of RAM and 32GB of onboard storage. Priced at $400, the Idol 4S is a steal when compared to mid-range devices from LG, Samsung and HTC. And that’s before you factor in the included VR headset, JBL earphones, Incipio case and tempered glass screen protector that are included in the box. Alcatel Idol 4S Specifications 5.5-inch Quad HD AMOLED display Snapdragon 652 processor 3GB of RAM 32GB internal storage microSD card support (up to 200GB) 16MP main camera with two-tone dual-LED flash, f/2.0 aperture, Sony IMX298 sensor 8MP front-facing camera with and 84° wide-angle lens and flash Front-facing stereo speakers (JBL certified) 3,000mAh battery Quick Charge 2.0 Android 6.0 Marshmallow Design At quick glance, the Alcatel Idol 4S could easily be confused with the Samsung Galaxy S6. The phone features glass panels on its front and back and an aluminum frame which wraps around the edges of the phone. The glass panels are a little smaller than the frame of the phone, revealing the stereo speaker grills on both the front and back sides of the phone. The choice of build materials and unique design elements give the Idol 4S quite an attractive look. The metal frame is a bit sharp in the hand, but not too unpleasant. One thing is certain, the Alcatel Idol 4S looks and feel like a phone that should be selling for $600. The only element of the design I’m not particularly fond of is the placement of the Boom Key – a multi-function button which enhances the user experience when using the phone’s stock apps. Its design and feel bring back memories of the power buttons on Sony devices from a few years back, but its placement relegates the actual power button to the left edge. Fortunately, you can double tap on the phone’s display to turn it on or off. Performance & Battery For a mid-range device, the Idol 4S performs quite admirably. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 652 processor used inside the phone is powerful and its 3GB of RAM is adequate for quick multi-tasking. The phone won’t be able to keep up with flagship devices running on a Snapdragon 820, but it’s more than capable of playing games like CSR2, Leo’s Fortune or any other of the stunning 3D games available on Android. The games themselves take a while to load, but once they do, the gaming experience is surprisingly enjoyable. The phone’s battery life isn’t anything special, but it manages to keep the phone running for a bit longer than you might expect. The non-removable 3,000 mAh cell is exactly what you’d expect from a phone in this category. Despite the phone’s 5.5-inch QHD display, the Idol 4S can easily manage 14-16 hours between charges for heavy users with more than 4 hours of screen-on time. With light use, the Idol 4S can even manage to make it through two full days. Since the phone is using a Qualcomm chip, it support’s Quick Charge 2.0. This means to can charge the phone from zero to 30 percent in roughly 15 minutes or charge the battery completely in roughly 70 minutes. Audio The phone’s gaming enjoyability factor is enhanced by the JBL-certified stereo speakers on the Alcatel Idol 4S. If you’re looking for a phone with great audio, you definitely need to hear what this phone is capable of. While most devices on the market rely on a single speaker on the bottom edge or back side of the phone, the stereo speakers on the Idol 4S are uniquely designed to pump out audio on the front and back of the phone. There’s simply nothing like it on the market. The phone’s audio experience is also enhanced by the Waves MaxxAudio app which allows you to select various equalizer presets for music and movies or create your own to fit your personal preferences. While the HTC 10’s custom audio tuning is hidden away in the phone’s settings, 4S users can quickly toggle between the various presets from quick settings. The included JBL earphones won’t be winning any prizes for outstanding audio quality, but they are comfortable and their build quality is a step above what you usually get with a $400 phone. Software The Android 6.0.1 software build on the Idol 4S is like a breath of fresh air when compared to the heavy Android modifications that are imposed on Samsung and LG smartphone owners. If you look past the rounded-corner icons and the lightly tweaked app launcher, you might think that the phone is running on stock Android. A nice refinement that Alcatel has added is a parallax and blur effect to its stock launcher. The wallpaper moves slightly when the phone is rotated and then blurs when your finger approaches the display. You also get Alcatel’s version of the always-on display which shows the clock and notifications when the phone is picked up or pulled out of your pocket. In addition to double tapping the screen to turn it on or off, the 4S also includes gesture shortcuts which can be customized to launch specific apps when you trace the letters C, W, M or e on the display when it is turned off. We’ve seen these features on devices from Motorola, Samsung and Huawei before, but it’s nice to see Alcatel incorporated them as well. As for the Boom Key, the Idol 4S could have done without it. The purpose of the button is to make the user experience better, but there simply aren’t enough Boom enhancements built into the phone to make it worth having a dedicated hardware button for. We’re sure that some people will enjoy the Boom weather enhancements on the homescreen or the instant collage in the photo gallery when the button is pressed, but the only thing I used the button for was to snap pictures with the camera. Virtual Reality The only aspect of the phone’s software that could use a little more work is pre-installed VR applications found on the Idol 4S. In an effort to keep the VR experience as simple as possible, Alcatel has its own VR launcher and VR store apps. The VR launcher is pretty similar to the Google Cardboard app, but the VR Store is simply a library displaying a small selection of VR apps available on Google Play. Using the app could give users the impression that there isn’t a whole lot of VR content for them to consume and interact with. Google doesn’t have a dedicated VR section within Google Play yet, but Alcatel could have come up with a better solution for their VR store. Fortunately, the VR headset which is included with the phone is a lot better than most Google Cardboard kits out there. Remove the front panel, snap the phone into place, adjust the elastic Velcro straps and you’re all set for your virtual adventure. The headset isn’t too heavy and the capacitive buttons located along its bottom edge allow you to easily interact with the VR content with your thumbs. The lenses aren’t adjustable, but that’s to be expected since it is a free accessory. Playing the pre-installed VR games and watching 360-degree video with the Alcatel Idol 4S’s VR headset is an enjoyable experience. My daughters have wasted a handful of hours with it over the past week and friends who have tested it have all been amazed when putting the headset on. If you’re really into VR, there are a lot of better options out there, but the Idol 4S may be the perfect device to get people hooked on VR. It’s worth noting that the phone’s 5.5-inch display plays a huge factor in delivering an enjoyable VR experience. A QHD AMOLED display is typically not seen in phones at this price point. The display is sharp, bright and its preset color balance didn’t pose any issues for me. Those who have issues with the color tone can tweak the display settings to their liking. Like most AMOLED panels these days, the display is still usable in direct sunlight and can get extremely dark if you’re using it in bed at night. I didn’t have any issues with viewing angles unless you count the glare from the protective glass panel. Camera When you buy a mid-range smartphone, you typically don’t expect to get a device with a good camera. That’s not the case with the Alcatel Idol 4S. The camera on the back is equipped with a Sony IMX298 sensor, f/2.0 aperture lens and two-tone dual-LED flash. If you don’t know, the Sony IMX298 is the same sensor used in the OnePlus 3, Huawei Mate 8 and Xiaomi Mi 5. Capturing a good shot is pretty easy. Contrast, exposure, and white balance fall in line perfectly most the time. If you’re the type who enjoys taking full control, the manual mode allows you to adjust the ISO, shutter speed, white balance and focus settings manually. The images captured by the Idol 4S are quite good and the shutter speed is quick enough to freeze moving object without much blur. Like some of the phones mentioned above, the 4S performs adequately in low-light, but it’s not on the same level as the HTC 10 or the Galaxy S7. There’s typically a lot of noise in the shots and you can easily end up with a blurry image if you don’t keep the phone stable. The only thing I’m not really fond of is the phone’s HDR photos since you often get glowing halo effect where the sky meets the object in the foreground. Hopefully, this can be addressed with a future software update. The images captured by the Idol 4S are quite good and the shutter speed is quick enough to freeze moving objects without much blur.

The only thing I’m not really fond of is the phone’s HDR photos since you often get a glowing halo effect where the sky meets the object in the foreground. Hopefully, this can be addressed with a future software update. Those who love snapping selfies will be more than happy with the 8MP front-facing camera. It can even capture decent selfies in a low-lit restaurant thanks to the front-facing flash. Just be sure you turn down the beauty mode setting so that the faces in your pictures don’t come out as a smudgy mess. Conclusion If the Alcatel Idol 4S was judged against mid-range devices from HTC, Samsung LG and Sony, it would stand head and shoulders above the competition. The problem is that we have flagship-level devices from Xiaomi, OnePlus and ZTE which are also selling for $400. While most of these devices have a compromise or two, they all feature much faster processors and RAM. But that doesn’t make the Idol 4S a bad buy. The phone’s clean software, gorgeous display and impressive audio give the Idol 4S a unique experience which isn’t offered by the low-cost flagship phones from China. In the end, it’s up to the buyer to decide if more processing power (which isn’t really a necessity) is more important than the other refinements offered by Alcatel. Alcatel Idol 4S Rating: star_fullstar_fullstar_fullstar_fullstar_empty (4.0 / 5) The Good Beautiful glass and metal design Great audio High-quality display The Bad A bit under powered Camera HDR halo effect Overpriced when compared to similarly-priced devices The Bottom Line If you’re looking for a well-rounded mid-range smartphone with a great audio experience and a handful of bundles accessories in the $400-range, you can’t go wrong with the Alcatel Idol 4S.   local_offer    Alcatel  Alcatel Idol 4S  Best of Phandroid   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (8) Quick Jump keyboard_arrow_up Alcatel Idol 4S Specifications Design Performance & Battery Audio Software Virtual Reality Camera Conclusion Terms of Service | Privacy Policy | Android is a trademark of Google Inc. | © Phandroid.com, 2007-2016

Brian Barrett Security Date of Publication: 08.09.16. 08.09.16 Time of Publication: 9:00 am. 9:00 am Vulnerability Exposes 900M Android Devices—and Fixing Them Won’t Be Easy Chris Goodney/Bloomberg/Getty Images The latest Android vulnerability to fret about isn’t limited to any particular device, or any specific firmware version. That’s because it doesn’t start with Android at all, but with Qualcomm, the company that provides internal components for hardware manufacturers. Lots of them. In this case, 900 million Android smartphones with Qualcomm inside are at risk, and fixing them will be no easy task. As security research firm Check Point detailed this week, the vulnerability in question is actually a set of four issues, collectively called QuadRooter, and affects Qualcomm chipsets from manufacturers ranging from HTC to LG to OnePlus to Google, which contracts with other makers for its own Nexus devices. It’s serious; compromised devices would give bad actors root access, meaning they could collect any data stored on the phone, control the camera and microphone, and track its GPS location. It’s like giving someone the keys to your house, then holding the door open for them while they make off with the jewels. Smartphones and tablets often experience vulnerabilities like this, regardless of the operating system. When it happens on iOS, though, Apple’s generally able to address the issue quickly because it so tightly controls both the hardware and software that comprise its ecosystem. On Android, the fixes are rarely so easy. “Android security updates are really hard,” says Jeff Zacuto, a member of Check Point’s Mobile Research team. “The Android ecosystem is so fragmented. There are a lot of different versions and variants of Android in the marketplace, because each individual device has its own particular nuances.” That’s not a new problem; even at the most basic level, only 15 percent of Android devices have updated to Android 6.0 Marshmallow, which Google released last October. Nearly a third are still on Android 4.4 KitKat, which by now is nearly three years old. Those updates don’t just bring fun new features; they also bring valuable security enhancements. The nature of QuadRooter exacerbates these issues, because it impacts Qualcomm drivers, which are installed not by Google but by individual manufacturers. Those manufacturers also generally produce several models of each smartphone they ship, tailoring them to carriers, who often install custom software of their own before the devices get to the consumer. That’s why, even though Qualcomm released patches for all four vulnerabilities between April and July, the fixes are still slow to reach actual devices. Even Google’s Nexus devices, which are typically at the vanguard of security, have only addressed three of the four issues. The last will be included as part of a broader security update in the coming months. As for the other hundreds of millions of impacted devices, it’s not clear how many have gone through the update process. “In order to get these security patches to the end user, they have to travel the whole length of the Android lifecycle,” says Zacuto. “That’s all the way from the supplier down to the end user, and you’ve got manufacturers in the mix, Google in the mix, and also the carriers.” Check Point has created a free app with which people can scan their devices to see if theirs is currently vulnerable (which also, for what it’s worth, doubles as marketing for Check Point). “We appreciate Check Point’s research as it helps improve the safety of the broader mobile ecosystem,” says a Google spokesperson. The company rated the four QuadRoot issues as “high” risk. The other options on its assessment scale are “moderate” and “critical,” making QuadRooter serious but not devastating. That’s partly because falling victim to a QuadRoot attack requires downloading a malicious app. Zacuto says that while Google is generally very good at keeping malware out of the Google Play store, the practice of sideloading apps from untrusted sources could leave plenty of devices at risk, especially in regions outside of the US where the practice is more common. Even if vigilant Android owners should be unscathed, QuadRoot is yet another reminder of how difficult it is to keep Android devices safe. With so many devices, and so many variants within those devices, and such belated updating on the part of users, problems like QuadRoot won’t just continue to appear. They’ll continue to stick around far longer than they reasonably should. “The security model in the Android ecosystem is inherently flawed,” says Zacuto. And while Google has done terrific work securing its own devices, it’s got too far to go still making sure all of its partners can ensure our safety as well. Go Back to Top.

Resend activation e-mail Technology Lab / Information Technology Google Fiber re-thinks plans as it considers wireless alternative Wireless could help Google Fiber avoid fights with incumbents over pole access. by Jon Brodkin - Aug 9, 2016 1:25 pm UTC Login to bookmark Webpass radios on a San Francisco building. Webpass Google Fiber was planning to install fiber lines in San Jose starting last month, but has delayed the project while it considers a wireless alternative, according to a report today in the San Jose Mercury News. Google Fiber recently announced plans to purchase Webpass, a company that uses point-to-point wireless technology to offer speeds up to 1Gbps, the same as Google's fiber-to-the-home network. San Jose may not be the only city where Google Fiber re-thinks current plans as a result of its newfound wireless capabilities. The Webpass purchase is expected to be completed this summer. "Google Fiber is already up and running in seven other major cities, outside California, but a source familiar with the project says the company is putting additional fiber locations on the back burner to reassess the technology and explore a cheaper alternative—wireless service that does not require expensive, capital-intensive and time-consuming installation of fiber cables under the ground," the Mercury News reported. "The source said Google is now focusing more on aerial installation." Google Fiber has been talking with San Jose city officials about a deployment for more than two years. Webpass's wireless technology is better suited to multi-unit residential buildings than single-family homes. But it could speed Google Fiber deployment, which has also stalled in other cities where Google must negotiate access to utility poles owned by the incumbent ISPs against which it's trying to compete. The Webpass network relies on antennas and receivers placed on top of high buildings. In San Jose, Google Fiber was very close to starting construction. "The company was set to begin digging in San Jose last month, but nearly 100 employees hired to install Google Fiber were pulled into an office and told the project was being delayed, according to workers. They were offered a transfer to San Diego to work on an unrelated project," the Mercury News report said. Officials in nearby Mountain View and Palo Alto were also talking to Google Fiber about bringing the high-speed Internet service to their cities, but they say Google told them the project has been delayed. Mountain View public works director Mike Fuller called the delay a "surprise... because we were working on what was their plan at the time." A San Jose city spokesperson said they remain optimistic that Google Fiber will offer service "even if their original schedule gets modified so they can take advantage of technology advances that might be potentially less disruptive." Palo Alto city staff wrote a report that said deployment of Google Fiber is delayed "up to six months or more" while the company "explor[es] more innovative ways of deployment that overcome some of the challenges they are facing in their current builds." We contacted Google for more information this morning but haven't heard back yet. A Google Fiber spokesperson told the Mercury News that it is continuing talks with Silicon Valley-area cities about deploying Internet service. But it "takes time" to deploy "the latest technologies in alignment with our product road map, while understanding local considerations and challenges," the spokesperson said. UPDATE: Google replied to Ars, saying it has no specific timelines to share but that it is "continuing to work with city leaders to explore the possibility of bringing Google Fiber to the South Bay area... The cities of San Jose, Mountain View, Palo Alto, Santa Clara, and Sunnyvale have been great partners and we’re thankful for the hard work that city leaders continue to do along the way.” Google did not say whether it has changed plans anywhere else. Google Fiber is already available in Atlanta, Georgia; Austin, Texas; Charlotte, N.C.; Kansas City, Missouri and Kansas; Nashville, Tennessee; and Provo, Utah. Google lists San Jose as a "potential" fiber market, along with 11 others, and says it has definite plans to build in another five markets.

Google is asking about your interests to better populate Google Now Some Android users have a better mechanism to tell Google their favorite bands, sports teams, movies, people, and more. Derek Walter on 09 August, 2016 04:12 0 - - - - print email Google Now is always a work in progress. The latest new feature showing up for some users is a new interface for picking your favorite sports teams, TV shows, musicians, and other topics. Screenshots shared to Android Police illustrate what the concept looks like. Android Police Google Now may present a more colorful interface for selecting what you’re interested in seeing. Once you select one of the main categories, then you can go through and pick individual TV shows, people, stocks, or other specifics. Android Police Pick out people who are in the news or favorite programs to get updates about. I’ve yet to see this appear on any of my Android devices, but such rollouts often take time. The goal is to better serve you with customized news and updates in your Google Now feed. While Google will usually pick up on concepts that you search for a lot, it’ll be helpful to customize this more directly. The impact on you: You may not see this feature yet, as this is clearly some type of server-side switch on Google’s part. So keep an eye out for it, as this looks like a good way to tell Google more specifically what types of news updates you want to see in your Now stream.

Simon Harriott STYLISTIC Q702 My first impression after unboxing the Q702 is that it is a nice looking unit. Styling is somewhat minimalist but very effective. The tablet part, once detached, has a nice weight, and no buttons or switches are located in awkward or intrusive positions.

Internet Google now lets you order food, book a table straight from search results By Bindu Nair - Scores of people nowadays utilize Google as a way to search for places to eat before heading to another link in order to place an order or book a reservation. The search giant is now rolling out a brand new feature which lets users do so right from the search results. Anyone who uses Google to search for a nearby restaurant from their handset starting from today will be greeted with a new ‘Place an order’ option in the results. Tapping on it will trigger a window which asks them whether they want to place an order via Zomato or Swiggy. Once they pick a service, they’ll be taken to that platform’s website to complete the order. Google has only tied up with Zomato and Swiggy for food delivery as of now. It plans to add more partners in the future. Even the new restaurant reservations option suffers from the same fate, with the company only joining hands with Dineout and Bytplus to help users book a table ahead of time at present. Also Read: Google to introduce brand new launcher for 2016 Nexus phones In related news, Google recently announced that it was planning to extend its Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) project to all search results instead of just being restricted to the Top Stories carousel. The feature allows pages to load much faster than usual. While it was initially focused on news, its reach has now expanded to recipe sites, entertainment and travel. Google says the new food-focused features have just started rolling out for Google Search and the Google app for iOS and Android, so it might take some time before you can access it. It’s looking to evolve the look and feel of the tool over time.

Pocket-lint News Apps Cameras Cars Drones Fitness Trackers Gadgets Games Headphones Laptops Parenting Phones Smart Home Smartwatches Speakers Tablets TV VR All News Reviews Apps Cameras Cars Drones Fitness Trackers Gadgets Games Headphones Laptops Parenting Phones Smart Home Smartwatches Speakers Tablets TV VR All Reviews Features Deals YouTube Instagram Facebook Twitter Google+ search Phones Best Phone Cameras Fitness trackers Parent hub Smart home EE Pocket-lint Awards Android Launchers: How to install, change and customise your phone Cam Bunton9 August 2016Apps Pocket-lint Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment One of the best, and most often cited, advantages of having an Android device is that you can customise the way it looks. But if you thought the most you could do with it was change your wallpapers and widgets, you’re in for a treat. By downloading new launchers on to your phone, you can change the way the entire interface looks. And - depending on which launcher you install - you can even change things as minute as individual app icons. How to choose an Android launcher Before choosing a launcher, it’s worth considering what you want from your Android phone. If you have a device from a Chinese manufacturer like Oppo or Huawei - or a heavily skinned device like one of LG’s - and you just want a more stock Android-like experience, the best launcher to download is probably the Google Now launcher. The Google Now launcher brings a visual experience which is much more like the stock/standard Android look and feel. You’ll likely still have the odd flair of the default software lurking around, like in the settings menu or the drop-down notification drawer, but your home screen and app drawer will change. But, if like so many others you just want to be able to control every element of your phone’s software experience, you will probably want Nova Launcher. It comes as both a free and premium version, the latter gives you many more options and is definitely worth the outlay if you just want your phone to look the way you want it to. Nova Launcher lets you do things like change the size of your home screen icons manually, as well as installing custom icon packs so you can change the way they look too. You can choose how many rows and columns of apps you want on the home screen and in your app drawer, and even fine-tune the way the Google search bar appears. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. In fact, Nova Launcher is so in-depth, it could probably do with its own entire explainer and tutorial feature, so we’ll leave that there for now. Sufficed to say, if you like toying and customising, there are few that offer the granular options Nova Launcher includes. Pocket-lint Download an Android launcher The first step to installing a new launcher is exactly the same as downloading an app. Simply head to the Google Play Store and search for the launcher by name (list of suggestions at the bottom of this post) or simply type "launcher". We’ll use the Google Now Launcher as an example in this guide, but the same process applies to all. Of course, if you have a Nexus or Moto device, you already have this launcher installed as default. Once you’ve found the launcher you want to download and you’ve installed it, the next step is setting it up. Most Android launchers have a setup guide included to help you get started quickly, so simply tap on the launcher’s app icon, which should have appeared on your home screen. If it hasn’t, check the app drawer, where all your other apps live. When you tap the app icon - depending which phone you’re using - you may see a popup message saying something like “X launcher is currently set as your default, go to settings to try [new launcher name]”. Once you’ve confirmed you want to try it, your home screen look should completely change. Often when this happens, you haven’t actually set the new launcher as a default, so it may be confusing when you press the home button and it reverts back to your old launcher. Which it may do. Your phone could either do that, or give you a handy popup asking you which launcher you’d like to use as a default. Change default Android launcher Actually setting the launcher as your default launcher is a process which varies a little depending on your device. With some Android phones you head to Settings>Home, and then you choose the launcher you want. With others you head to Settings>Apps and then hit the settings cog icon in the top corner where you’ll then options to change default apps. Others like Huawei make it a little trickier. Using the EMUI software from Huawei as an example, you head to Settings>Apps then tap “advanced” on the bottom bar and select “Default app settings”. On the next screen you’ll see a list of all the apps you can set defaults for, select “Launcher” and choose Google app, or which ever other launcher you downloaded. Oppo, similarly makes it a less than intuitive procedure. In its ColorOS system, you head to Settings then find Additional settings>Default application>Home. What next? As we alluded to earlier, once you actually have the launcher active on your phone, the home screen appearance changes. Your apps will most likely no longer be organised how you had them before, so you’ll need to spend a few minutes (okay, maybe more than just a few) placing your apps, creating folders, choosing a wallpaper etc. You can also gain access to your launcher settings, to customise various aspects of it. With many of them, you just tap and hold on the home screen and there’s a settings bar right next to the usual wallpaper and widgets options, you may even seen an icon pack option (depending on which launcher you’re using). Pocket-lint What Android launchers are there? There are a number of decent launchers for Android, each of them offering something a little different to the rest. Google Now Launcher  Offers a simple, clean stock Android experience. Nova Launcher  Customisability at its best. You can change almost any aspect of your phone software experience. Microsoft Arrow Launcher  Very clean launcher which intelligently sorts your most used apps and frequently contacted people to make them easy to get to. It also gives you individual home screens for your reminders/tasks, widgets, documents and apps.  Yahoo Aviate Launcher  Yahoo’s launcher is similar in premise to the Arrow launcher from Microsoft. Its aim is to make your most-used features easy to get to. It also gives you a Google Now-like run down of information you need to know for the day. This include directions to get you home, recommended nearby restaurants, weather forecasts in favourite locations and more. Action Launcher Like Nova Launcher, Action launcher gives you the ability to customise a number of user interface elements within the software. It is Perhaps more appealing to those with little patience to set their home screens up again though, since it can import your existing app/home screen layout, rather than force you to start again. Other launchers like Go Launcher, Buzz Launcher, Solo Launcher, Smart Launcher and Apex Launcher all offer the ability to customise the appearance of the phone’s theme, icons, and some even add custom gestures for launching specific functions. Which one is the best depends entirely on what you need it to do. If you have the patience, and want to try a few different launchers out, you have the freedom to do that. Most are free to download, some have “Prime” versions which are paid-for upgrades, but come with more features.

A heated debate took place on Monday when a Google representative and a group of industry insiders exchanged their ideas over whether the government should approve of Google's plan to access the nation's geographical information. "Google needs government approval over hosting local map data abroad to operate our map service in Korea, as we have to store the data in our cloud platform across the world for more stable and efficient operation of the service," Kwon Beom-joon, a software engineer at Google Korea, said in the discussion session at the National Assembly. He stressed that a number of foreign tourists have had a tough time accessing its map data service here, due to the issue. "We hope to supply our map service in Korea, as we have done in other countries," he said. The Korea Association of Surveying and Mapping ― a non-profit organization dealing with map-related surveys here ― held the discussion four days before a planned meeting on Friday by a special state-run coalition organized to deal with the issue. The coalition ― led by seven government bodies including the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning and the Ministry of National Defense ― was established last year to discuss pros and cons over the Google request. During the session, the nation's top portal service operator ― Naver ― expressed fierce opposition, citing Google's lack of a map-related server in Korea. Naver Vice President Yoon Young-chan said: "We do not urge Google to establish a data center here, but set up a server (to manage the map data.)" "Local companies are suffering reverse discrimination in favor of global IT giants," he said. His remark reflects a view that the Korean government should also impose the same regulatory measures on Google. "Google should fulfill its duties as a business operator," the Naver executive said. "If Google establishes a server here, the company can operate map services without hosting the data abroad. This is also a requirement for Google to follow the domestic legal system and pay taxes accordingly." The Google engineer, however, countered the argument by saying that the company is managing map data based on its globally-operated cloud system. "Under the cloud-based management, Google needs to host the map data abroad, even if we establish a data center here," he said. "We are also following domestic tax regulations in all the countries that Google operates in." On Jun. 1, Google requested the National Geographic Information Institute (NGII) to approve its plan to host the local geographic data abroad. The special coalition plans to make its final decision over whether to approve the plan, on Aug. 25. mhlee@ktimes.com Government in bind over Google map data   'Romantic Doctor' tops 20 percent view...

The update brings SD card support and 'Wi-Fi only' mode to Google's navigation app. Thanks to the latest update, users will now be able to easily navigate long stretches of roads while still saving on device storage and data. The update adds a new 'Wi-Fi Only' option in the Settings Menu, which replaces the 'Offline Areas' option. When the option is enabled, the app will stop using cellular data and load majority of the navigation data through Wi-Fi. The Wi-Fi mode looks like a handy option that can save on your mobile data charges when you are on the go. Along with this, the update also adds the ability for users to download offline areas to an SD card and save the internal storage on your phone. New features introduced on Google Maps app for Indian users Google India, in a press conference on in Chennai Thursday, explained some of the new features introduced on Google Maps. However, to see what the traffic is like or update offline maps, users can easily switch back to online mode. This can be done by finding the nearest Wi-Fi. Recently, Google rolled out an update to its Google Maps iOS app. The update finally brought the much-needed multiple-stop support to the app. Thanks to the update, Google Maps on iOS now provides the users the ability to add multiple stops on a single trip. Interestingly, the feature has been available on the web version of Maps for quite some time. Support for multiple stops was rolled to the Maps app on Android recently, and now iOS users can enjoy it as well.

Google will power Stanford's genomics service Engadget 09/08/2016 Mariella Moon © Provided by Engadget Stanford aims to make genetic testing a normal part of patient care, and it's teaming up with Google to make that happen. The university's School of Medicine will launch Clinical Genomics Service this fall, which is powered by Google Genomics that stores DNA data in the cloud. DNA sequencing is built into the system -- doctors that request for it will get a large amount of data back. They can then use Google Cloud to analyze the data they get and compare it against other information in the system to find any anomaly that might be responsible for a patient's condition. It could improve how doctors treat different cancers and help decipher illnesses that are especially hard to diagnose and treat correctly. Lloyd Minor, Stanford's School of Medicine dean, said: "In the past few years, the amount of available data about health care has exploded. While researchers are learning to integrate this big data, putting it to work for individual patients, in real time, is a huge challenge. Our collaboration with Google will help us to meet this challenge." While Stanford is storing all the DNA data it gets on the Google Cloud Platform, only the university will have access to it.

By: Tech Desk | Updated: August 10, 2016 9:04 am Google Maps has rolled out new offline features – SD card support and WiFi only mode – for Android that will allow users to save data on-the-go. Google Maps has rolled out new offline features – SD card support and WiFi only mode – for Android that will allow users to save data on-the-go. In addition to saving an area of the maps for offline use later, users can opt to save downloaded maps to an external SD card. Having a device that supports SD card is obviously mandatory. Users can save a variety of information like holiday snaps or road trip playlists. Also, users can choose to save on mobile data by taking Google Maps completely offline. Once the WiFi mode is switched on, Google Maps app will work offline, even without WiFi. While the app significantly relies on WiFi, it might still use a small amount of cellular data. While switching on the WiFi only feature, users will get a pop-up saying, “You should know…A small amount of data might still be used, but it will be significantly less while on Wi-Fi only.” In case, users need to check for traffic or update offline maps; they can switch back to online mode from setting menu. The WiFi only feature was first spotted by Android Police late July. The report said the new feature is being rolled out for users in phases. India is increasingly becoming a potential market for Google Maps. Google recently made changes to the app to make it more India-focused. The app now understands Hindi and offers direction in the language. Also, there’s offline feature and traffic alerts. We could expect the WiFi only feature to reach the Indian audience soon.

While the Wi-Fi only mode is not exactly new, Google did make it official, along with a new feature that lets you save downloaded maps to an SD card. Image : Android Police Previously known as ‘offline areas’, the new ‘Wi-Fi only’ toggle does what it states, which is to disconnect the Maps app from your cellular or data network. Google, however, states in a small pop-up that the Maps app may still use a small amount of data during operation. Upon switching the toggle on, a blue bar appears at the top of the screen to inform users that the app is in Wi-Fi only mode. Additionally, Google understands how difficult it is for users to take Maps offline since they do take up quite a bit of space. So for all those smartphone users who are stuck with 8GB of internal storage, Google has made offline maps convenient, by letting you save your offline maps to an external SD card instead of the smartphone’s internal storage. With this Google hopes that more users will be able to take Google Maps offline and save plenty of maps to their often larger, external storage cards. Adding to this, Google has also added more ride service options (apart from Uber) for some countries. The search giant states that all of the above options will make it easier for travellers to not just get around foreign lands but also compare ride prices and save on some much needed battery life!

Share Tweet Share Tags : iOS-iOS+ Android-Android+ Google-Google+ Nothing's worse* than trying to take a cool photo or video on your smartphone and finding out that you can't because you've run out of storage space. Google knows that this is an issue for many users out there, and that's why it's been offering (for quite some time now) free unlimited storage space via its Google Photos app. Besides providing unlimited storage space, the Google Photos app comes with a Free Up Space feature: photos and videos that are already backed up in the cloud can be removed from your device with a simple tap. Obviously, you'll still be able to access and download these at any time as long as your device is connected to the internet (either via Wi-Fi, or a cellular network). When Google Photos notices that there isn't much free space left on your phone or tablet, it can automatically ask you if you want to recover storage space, but you can also trigger the feature manually from the app's Settings menu. To showcase just how great Google Photos can be, Google recently released a quick video full of ruined photos (more exactly, they've been ruined by the lack of available space). If you use Google Photos, though, you never have to worry about that, as the video - embedded below - concludes. More than 200 million users already have Google Photos installed on their devices, so the app is one of the most popular of its kind out there, but there's definitely more room to grow. As you probably know, Google Photos isn't exclusive to Android: it's also available on iOS, offering iPhone and iPad users pretty much the same benefits that Android folks are getting. * - well, OK, there are plenty of worse things in this world.

This week, Google’s on the offense, with a new Google Photos ad that takes a dig at 16GB iPhones which appear to be perpetually out of space. TNW Answers Your questions answered by founders, experts and thought leaders in business, design and tech. Join a chat The struggle is real for 16GB iPhone users: Do you save the internal memory for pictures or leave room to download your favorite apps? Which photos are non-essential enough to transfer out of your device? Do you skip an app update because there’s simply no room for it? If you’re the kind to “free up space” on your phone by shipping pictures out to live on a faraway camp, then Google Photos wants to sweep you right up. The service’s feature is dedicated to doing just this: clearing space on your phone by automatically transferring images to the cloud and off your device. Unlike Apple’s iCloud service, which starts at $0.99 a month for 50GB, Google Photos has unlimited storage for free (for images up to 16 megapixels and 1080p videos.) It’s been Google’s competitive strategy since its launch last year, but now even more apparent as we head into September, where Apple is expected to announce a new iPhone and get rid of the 16GB model altogether. on The Verge Read next: Hulu goes subscription-only by moving its free stuff to Yahoo CreativeGoogleiPhone Share on Facebook (289) Share on Twitter (288) Natt Garun is a reporter from New York City, US.

Featured Story: Win $430K for Your HoloLens Concept App in the US Dept. of Education's EdSim Challenge HoloLens: Know-how for Microsoft's HoloLens & other AR/VR tools. — Next Reality News: The HoloLens Might Have a Small Field of View, but That's Actually a Good Thing Adam Dachis 3 months ago The HoloLens Might Have a Small Field of View, but That's Actually a Good Thing Microsoft's HoloLens is certainly a leap into the future of mixed reality interfaces, but it's not without drawbacks. Its most notable drawback is its small field of view, cutting off objects you feel like you should be able to see. But there's good reason for that limitation, and it might not matter once the HoloLens hits the consumer market. It's Easy to Forgive the Drawbacks of True Innovation My first experiences with virtual and augmented reality began with Google Cardboard and Google Glass. Cardboard was not only boring but frustrating, and Glass seemed nearly useless and was on its way to becoming far too creepy to be marketable. Don't Miss: The Difference Between AR, VR & MR I eventually tried out a Samsung Gear VR and realized that immersive VR experiences on these devices really do have some potential, but nothing sold me on the future of this technology like the HoloLens. For myself and so many others who have written their impressions of the device, the limited field of view is the main drawback, but I also think Microsoft made a tradeoff because other limitations would've been worse and, ultimately, it doesn't impact the experience when you look forward to when it hits the shelves. Why the Screen Is So Small First, it's important to understand the limited field of view and why Microsoft made this decision. When you put the HoloLens on, you can see a nearly invisible transparent screen that will contain all the holographic content the device projects. It's about the size of a smartphone screen held in landscape close to your face. While that would work just fine for watching a video, those rectangular bounds frequently truncate holographic content as you move your head around. Image by Adam Dachis/NextReality You won't notice much of a problem on the left and right sides of your face, but you lose a lot of valuable information above and below if you get too close to any projected object. At first, everything looks like it actually exists in real space even though it's clearly not there. Your mind understands the holograms as actual objects, despite their polychromatic aura, because they share the same space as the physical world. But that illusion dies just a bit when you look down and suddenly the head of the dog figurine you set on your coffee table disappears. Don't Miss: What Augmented Reality Needs to Come of Age Every time this happens it's hard not to wish for just a slightly larger viewing area, but there's a good reason we don't have one. Microsoft packed an entire Windows 10 computer into a headset that's powerful enough to process an insanely high amount of graphical data yet not require any cooling. Take a minute to imagine the heat generated from your laptop and the impact of the fans that cool it. Now think about having that on your head. Aside from safety concerns, it certainly wouldn't feel comfortable. With the technology currently available, the HoloLens can only process so much visual data before heat became a problem. By limiting the size of the screen, they were able to limit the amount of data that needed to be processed without losing quality. Image by Adam Dachis/NextReality Of course, the HoloLens could also feature a larger screen at a lower resolution, but part of the magic of the headset is that the resolution is just high enough to ignore the pixels. You can see them, of course, but they don't really feel like a problem in holographic 3D. You really only notice jagged edges with project flat text, such as in the Edge web browser. Even then it's not that bad and probably what you're used to if you don't have a computer with a HiDPI display (such as the retina displays on many Apple products). Image by Adam Dachis/NextReality Microsoft could've blown up the field of view, but at the cost of that resolution sweet spot. If you need to know why that doesn't look good, use a Nintendo 3DS—even the new one. The jagged edges ruin the effect in many cases, and that's on a device you hold much farther away from your face. The bottom line is this: Microsoft could've made other trade-offs, but I'm willing to bet you'd prefer the HoloLens didn't melt your hair off or have you pixel peeping all day long. The frame of view can feel too narrow at times, but you notice it more when you're sitting around looking at holograms. In many practical applications, you forget about it entirely. Good Apps & Games Make You Forget Hardware Limitations Microsoft HoloLens comes with several applications that sit comfortably inside your field of view or cause you to ignore the limitations due to their immersive nature. A game called RoboRaid has you fend off a malicious robot attack as several enemies burst through the wall. You spend more time thinking about how to avoid danger and destroy your targets than you do thinking about the limited view. You become immersed in the experience enough not to notice, and if you do—you don't have time to care. Image via Microsoft In an entirely different way, HoloTour takes you through Rome or Machu Picchu and teaches you history. You can walk around the room to change what you're seeing. Unlike RoboRaid, the action doesn't immerse you in the experience. Instead, you see everything through a window. The limitation is very apparent but also feels somewhat natural. Image via Microsoft Not all apps manage the limitations well. Crossy Road, for example, just sits in a flat, projected window that does get truncated by the viewing area if your head moves in the wrong direction. Furthermore, it really offers no advantage over playing on your smartphone and is just plain frustrating to control at times. But those other types of apps demonstrate how this restriction doesn't have to matter at all. If developers make the right choices and account for the limited viewing area, their HoloLens experiences will make you forget you can only see your mixed reality through a rectangle right in front of you.

That said, the cooling they've built into the Surface devices seems small enough that it may be possible to figure out a safe & light way to do it in a future version, if needed. NVIDIA GPUs, which would presumably be required to power a version with a wider field of view, all need active cooling.

Now, all Android users will be able to turn on Wi-Fi only mode, which was rolled out to select users earlier, and, also save maps to their SD card for offline access. Announcing the new Google Maps offline features in an emailed statement, the search giant said they are most useful when travelling in areas without data. The company confirmed the gradual rollout to the Android app, but did not detail when the new features would arrive for iOS users. Getting to the features - Google Maps for Android users can now save maps for offline use to an external SD card. This will help users keep their inbuilt storage free. To use the feature, navigate to Menu > Offline areas > Settings > Storage preferences > Device, and then select SD card.As for Wi-Fi only mode, the feature enables users to utilise Google Maps for Android completely offline. The app will then only use data from offline areas users have already downloaded. To use the feature, go to Menu > Settings and select Wi-Fi only. Google Maps got a major update last month, with its interface being revamped for a cleaner look, while the app also gained Areas of Interest. Shortly after, the iOS app was updated with the option to navigate to multiple destinations, allowing users to add pit-stops mid-route - with the app dividing them into Point A, Point B, and so forth. What do you think about the new offline features in Google Maps for Android? Will they be useful? Let us know via the comments.

The Google Transparency Project, the work of Campaign for Accountability, poured over reams of data to find 258 instances of “revolving door activity” between Google or its associated companies and the federal government, national political campaigns and Congress since 2009. Much of that revolving door activity took place at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, where 22 former White House officials went to work for Google and 31 executives from Google and related firms went to work at the White House or were appointed to federal advisory boards by Obama. Those boards include the President’s Council on Science and Technology and the President’s Council on Jobs and Competitiveness. Regulation watchdogs may be just as keen about the moves between Google and the Federal Communications Commission and Federal Trade Commission. Those government bodies regulate many of the programs that are at the heart of Google’s business, and there have been at least 15 moves between Google and its lobbying firms and those commissions.  Click for more from Watchdog.org.  Advertisement Trending in Politics 1 Opposition leader says Venezuelan gov't left talks 2 Poll: Despite Trump victory, voters support abortion, oppose border wall 3 Mr. Trump, please make a 'moonshot' for the Midwest.

Google Maps 9.34 update will now include a much-awaited feature. This new feature that will indicate users where parking spots are available, and thus saving them the trouble of going around parking lots searching for a free spot. The feature was first spotted by Android Police in Google Maps v9.34 Beta. While it is yet unclear how Google plans on accumulating this information, it is also to be ascertained whether this feature will be based on time of the day or specific events. With Google sending out updates in the days ahead, these points will be made clear. Along with giving parking information, the app will also come in with ‘keep map North up’ replacing the ‘Tilt Map’ option. This will disable the free map rotation with navigation function while it will also include a re-center button in the event of the user accidently swiping the map obstructing both destination and route. Google Map v9.34 Beta can be downloaded and installed via apk file available with APK Mirror website. Google Map has also introduced an update to include multiple-stop support which has made its way first to the web version and followed by both Android and iOS. via androidpolice   You may also like Busy on phone, woman driver kills 1 and injures 2 Cops fighting cops on road over bribe money distribution?

Police found the body of Vanessa Marcotte Sunday night about a half-mile from her mother’s home in the town of Princeton, Worcester District Attorney Joseph Early Jr. said Monday. She was reported missing Sunday after she didn’t return home. The 27-year-old’s death appears to be a homicide, and an autopsy was set to determine the exact cause, Early said. “We have a horrible set of facts; a horrible set of circumstances right now,” he said. Police say they don’t know if the attack was random. At a Monday news conference, authorities repeatedly urged the public to use caution and report any suspicious activity. “We are concerned about the safety of our town residents and visitors that enter our town,” Princeton Police Chief Michele Powers said. “We would ask people to pay attention to their surroundings.” Princeton is a town of about 3,500 residents around 40 miles west of Boston. There hasn’t been a homicide in the town in the 27 years Powers has worked there, she said. Marcotte worked as an account manager in New York for Google. In a statement Monday, Google said it is “deeply shocked and saddened.” “Vanessa Marcotte was a much loved member of the Google team, working in our New York office for the last year and a half, and known for her ubiquitous smile, passion for volunteer work and love of Boston sports,” the company said. Marcotte was a 2011 graduate of Boston University, which also mourned her death. “We’re so terribly sad for her family and friends,” Colin Riley, the executive director of media relations at Boston University, told ABC News. “They’re in our thoughts and prayers.” Marcotte’s death is similar to that of a New York City woman killed while on a run through a Queens park last week. Like Marcotte, 30-year-ol Katrina Vetrano was killed while running alone during daylight hours in a secluded area. There is no indication the deaths are connected.

Dr Who? Google Now lets you add more of your interests Love Game of Thrones? Dr Who? Google Now lets you add more of your interests By David Nield Mobile phones   More customisation on the way Shares Google Now is about to get a lot more interested in your interests, if an update spotted by Android Police is set for the world at large. The 'new' version of the app, which some users are now seeing, lets you add sports teams, TV shows, movies, musicians, people and even stock price updates that want to be informed about. "Get updates on your interests," says the new update card. "Pick teams, bands, movies, and more." As yet there's been no official word from Google on the new features. Now that's what I call Google You can already do some of this in Google Now but the new update appears to make the process easier as well as offering a more polished interface. The current app lets you add specific sports teams but you can't add specific TV shows or movies - only give Google Now a yay or a nay when it makes certain suggestions. According to the screenshots posted by Android Police, you'll be able to browse through topics by category, and see interests that are "popular in your area" - if your entire street is into Stranger Things, then you're going to know about it. It's obviously a step towards making Google Now much more customisable and personal. We know from IO 2016 that Google has big plans for its various AI-powered assistant apps and the company has never been shy of trying to gather as much info on you as possible. We're not seeing the update yet so there's no guarantee when it's going to appear on your device. It might just be a small-scale test by Google, but the screengrabs look polished enough for this to be a major update that's in the pipeline. 10 brilliant Google Now tips and tricks Here's more hands-on time with the Samsung Gear VR for the Galaxy Note 7: Via Android Police Tags Android Related news For 4K's sake: why is the industry making HDMI cables so complicated?

By Simon Haslwanter - August 9, 2016 380 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter tweet You might have heard from the problem some users experience while adding their GMail Account on Windows 10 Mobile. During the Authenticating process with the Outlook Mail app on Microsoft’s mobile operating system, Google recommended to use a different browser rather than Microsoft Edge in terms of compatibility. However, it seems like this was not intentional by Microsoft but more a mistake which has been fixed now. Google and Microsoft have a long history of disputes and reconciliations when it comes to apps and services. Not only that Google isn’t providing a single app for Microsoft’s operating system, but also if Microsoft wants to provide an official app for Google services the search giant radically prohibits every move Microsoft is trying to do. Meanwhile there are tons of third-party YouTube apps available in the Windows app store. Though for some exotic Google services like Google+ there isn’t really anything available in the Windows store. Especially for the experience of users who are new to the operating system it would be important to have all major Google apps in the store. Now, since a few days Windows 10 Mobile users have been reporting problems with adding a Gmail account to new builds in the Outlook Mail app. It was not possible to pass the authentication since Google didn’t allow access with Microsoft Edge. Back on Saturday Google responded in the Gmail Support Forum with an apologize and the news that this is finally fixed. Here is the statement from the company: Sorry for this problem everyone, this was not intentional and has now been fixed. […] Since there have been numerous disputes between the two companies in the past, there would have been a chance that Google simply blocked access to Gmail on Windows 10 Mobile devices. However, gladly this was not intentional and has been fixed now. Did our readers experience any problems with adding a Google Account to the Outlook Mail app and if so, is it finally working again? Feel free to drop us a comment below with your thoughts on this story and stay tuned for more Microsoft related news in the future.
