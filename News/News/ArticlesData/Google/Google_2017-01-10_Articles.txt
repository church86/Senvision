Tech Entertainment Business Social Deals Podcast About Security Image Source: Shutterstock Google may be forced to stop reading your Gmail for ads Chris Smith @chris_writes January 11th, 2017 at 5:48 PM Share Tweet The European Union is looking to take additional steps to guard the privacy of European internet users. The new initiative might limit the power of internet companies when it comes to collecting user data for various purposes. Targets include Facebook, WhatsApp, Google, Apple and pretty much any other company that handles any sort of user data. The new initiative might, for example, force Google to stop reading your Gmail to serve targeted ads without your approval. Don't Miss: Company that made exploding Galaxy Note 7 batteries announces breakthrough for electric cars The European Commission said in a press release on Tuesday that it proposes a “high level of privacy rules for all electronic communications and updates data protection rules for EU institutions.” The updated rules would treat telecom operators and internet service providers similarly when it comes to the handling of user data. Internet companies including Facebook, WhatsApp, Google, Apple, and others would have to guarantee that messages, voice calls, and email conversations are confidential. The new proposed laws would also affect cookies, which companies can use for various purposes including tracking users online. The new rules should make users “more in control of their settings, providing an easy way to accept or refuse the tracking of cookies and other identifiers in case of privacy risks.” Users will have to explicitly opt-in when it comes to sharing data with third parties. Services that use location data and other metadata would still be available to internet companies, and the EU believes they’ll bring over new business opportunities. But privacy has to be guaranteed, and businesses would have to ask for consent before using any data from their customers. “Privacy will be guaranteed for both content and metadata derived from electronic communications (e.g. time of a call and location),” the EU writes. “Both have a high privacy component and, under the proposed rules, will need to be anonymized or deleted if users have not given their consent unless the data is required for instance for billing purposes.” Naturally, the proposal was met with some opposition, with the European Telecommunications Network Operations (ETNO) arguing that the new rules would still put more pressure on traditional telecom companies. The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) is also unhappy about the new cookie stance the EU is taking, as the new laws could impact advertising revenue. The EU’s new privacy rules are just proposals at this time, but the Commission is looking to “ensure their smooth adoption” by May 25th, 2018.

Android Wear 2.0 Confirmed to Arrive in Early February GO Google Play alerts developers about the launch Jan 11, 2017 23:47 GMT  ·  By Andrei Vlad  ·  Share:  Although Google delayed the release of Android Wear 2.0, the search giant has major plans regarding the new operating system for wearable devices. Many companies support Google's Android Wear 2.0, so expect a plethora of smartwatches to be announced in the first half of the year. Companies like Casio, ZTE and Huawei have already confirmed they will release Android Wear 2.0 smartwatches in the coming months. Casio's new Pro Treck rugged smartwatch was officially unveiled last week at CES 2017 and is expected to go on sale in late April. However, there are already a bunch of Android Wear smartwatches available for purchase on the market, which will be upgraded to the new version of the OS when it gets released. Google postponed the launch of Android Wear 2.0 for Q1 2017, but the company did not confirm an exact release date. The good news is we have new information that somewhat suggests Android Wear 2.0 will arrive in early February. Android Wear 2.0 launch notification Apparently, some developers have received notifications from Google Play that state Android Wear 2.0 is launching in early February. The notification also mentions that the new OS will include a new on-watch Play Store to help users discover apps right on their wrist. It's unclear whether or not compatible smartwatches will be eligible for Android Wear 2.0 updates the moment the new OS goes official. In any case, we've put together a list of smartwatches that have been confirmed to receive the highly-anticipated Android Wear 2.0 update: Moto 360 Gen 2, Moto 360 Sport, LG Watch Urbane 2nd Edition LTE, LG Watch Urbane, LG G Watch R, Polar M600, Casio Smart Outdoor Watch, Nixon Mission, Tag Heuer Connected, Fossil Q Wander, Fossil Q Marshal, Fossil Q Founder, Michael Kors Access Bradshaw Smartwatch, Michael Kors Access Dylan Smartwatch, Huawei Watch, Huawei Watch Ladies, Asus ZenWatch 2, and Asus ZenWatch 3.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (2 Images) #Android Wear 2.0#Android Wear update#Google smartwatch#smartwatch update#download Android Wear subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Photo Gallery (2 Images) 01 02 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Casio Announces the WSD-F20 Rugged Smartwatch Powered by Android Wear 2.0 Intel and New Balance Announce RunIQ Android Wear Smartwatch with Atom CPU Google to Launch Two Flagship Android Wear 2.0 Smartwatches in Early 2017 Google Unveils Some Android Wear 2.0 Standalone Apps It's Now Possible to Use openSUSE Inside Windows 10, Here's How to Install It Barnes & Noble Halts Sales of Nook Tablets Due to Faulty Chargers Android Co-Founder Andy Rubin Working on a Premium Bezel-less Smartphone Lenovo Confirms New Moto Smartphones Will Be Unveiled at MWC 2017 Linus Torvalds Announces Fourth Linux 4.10 Kernel Release Candidate, Get It Now Debian Outs First Release Candidate of Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch" Installer Sony G3112 and G3221 Smartphones Coming Soon with MediaTek Helio P20 CPUs Linux Kernel 4.9.4 Released with Various ARM/ARM64 and Networking Improvements 2 photos    Android Wear 2.0 new android apps imo APK: Updated January 15th, 18:31 GMT AndroDumpper APK: Updated January 15th, 18:29 GMT MCPE Master APK: Updated January 15th, 18:27 GMT SuperSU APK: Updated January 15th, 18:24 GMT Geekbench 4 APK: Updated January 15th, 18:20 GMT Xbox Beta APK: Updated January 15th, 18:17 GMT Action Launcher 3 APK: Updated January 15th, 18:14 GMT Reader comments Galaxy S8 Most Likely Not the Phone in Samsung Display Videos more on: Samsung i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

It's been eight months since Google announced the Android Wear 2.0 update for Android Wear devices, and a few months since it confirmed the software was delayed but would arrive by early 2017. Now, thanks to an email sent to developers, we know when it will release. Android Police obtained an email sent to Android developers from Google. It specifically noted Android Wear 2.0 would launch "in early February 2017", before listing items developers should know prior to updating their existing apps for the update. A screenshot of the email is available here. We've reached out to Google for a comment, but it's already confirmed to ZDNet that the email is legit. In other words, Android Wear 2.0 will definitely launch in early February, bringing a built-in Play Store, the ability for apps to connect to the internet through Wi-Fi (sans a nearby smartphone), new app launcher, support for complications on watch faces, and more. You can learn more about these features and everything else that will be new in Pocket-lint's guide on the upcoming update. Google to launch two Android Wear watches in 2017, others also expected Keep in mind several watch makers recently unveiled new Android Wear watches at CES 2017 in Las Vegas, so it makes sense that Google would hurry the release, as there hasn't been any new devices to showcase the software until now.

This means slower loading times, especially for those who might not have stable or fast internet connections, but this is something that Google is looking to change with Google+. In an announcement on their blog, Google has announced that Google+ will now be able to display hi-res images that consume less bandwidth, thanks to the application of their RAISR technology. “RAISR, which was introduced in November, uses machine learning to produce great quality versions of low-resolution images, allowing you to see beautiful photos as the photographers intended them to be seen. By using RAISR to display some of the large images on Google+, we’ve been able to use up to 75 percent less bandwidth per image we’ve applied it to.” For those unfamiliar, RAISR was announced by Google last year in November. This is basically image upscaling technology that uses machine learning to transform low-resolution images into higher-resolution copies. The AI tries to determine the best filter to use per pixel that will help result in a high-res copy of the image that looks as close as it can to the original. As it stands these changes can be viewed when using Google+ on Android devices, but the company expects to roll out the technology more broadly in the coming weeks so that other users can enjoy it as well.

The first of five individuals associated with the hacker group known as 'Crackas Wth Attitude' (CWA), that are alleged to have hacked online accounts of U.S. Government officials in 2015, has pleaded guilty. 24-year-old Justin G. Liverman of North Carolina entered a plea agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice on Jan. 6. Liverman is one of two American citizens and five individuals who were alleged to be part of the CWA effort that was able to exploit internet accounts owned by senior U.S Government officials including CIA Chief John Brennan and U.S Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. Under the terms of the plea agreement, Liverman pleaded guilty to one felony count of conspiracy. According to the agreement, Liverman's actions were responsible for $95,000 in damages, out of $1.5 million in total damages caused by the CWA. As expected, the first vehicles powered by Google's self-driving technology will hit the roads later this month. The vehicles—a fleet of about 100 Chrysler Pacifica minivans developed in collaboration with Fiat Chrysler—will make their initial appearance in Phoenix, Ariz. and Google's hometown of Mountain View, Calif. John Krafcik, CEO of Waymo, the autonomous car startup that was spun out from Google last month, announced the rollout at a press event at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit on Sunday. Dynamic 365 kicks off 2017 with an enhanced search experience that removes a lot of the guesswork in tracking down the right information. Microsoft has upgraded the Dynamics 365 portal, a homepage that greets users of the company's modular, cloud-enabled customer relationship management (CRM) and enterprise resource planning (ERP) business application platform. Now, users can fine-tune the portal's search functionality, enabling them to narrow down the information they're seeking and find answers faster. The software maker added new entity filters to the portal's global search box. Organizations can customize the list of entity filters to suit their needs. Continuing the theme, Microsoft added a faceted navigation feature to results pages. Appearing as a new pane on the left side of the screen, it allows users to further modify their search results using a variety of filters. The number of vulnerabilities reported in Web applications decreased slightly in 2016 over the previous year, with flaws in popular content-management systems dramatically declining, security firm Imperva stated in an analysis released last week. While the decrease in Web vulnerabilities could be considered a sign of improving security for online applications, Nadav Avital, technical lead for Imperva's application security research team, told eWEEK, that's unlikely to be the case. The fast-changing software landscape—with industrial control systems, the internet of things and mobile applications all relatively fertile fields of vulnerability research—is more likely attracting attention from security researchers and away from Web applications, he said.

Now we may have a more precise timeframe. In an email being sent out to developers, Google says that “Android Wear 2.0 is launching in early February 2017.” The email is going out to devs with Android Wear apps that use the old APK installation method, rather than the new Android Wear 2.0 method that’ll include a Play Store on the watch. While “early February 2017” isn’t an exact date, it is more precise that the “early 2017” timeframe that Google previously announced. So if you’ve got an Android Wear smartwatch that’ll be updated to 2.0, you could be about a month away from getting some new software to play with. The update to Android Wear 2.0 will bring with it a few new features and improvements. There’s the aforementioned on-watch Play Store as well as handwriting support, Android Pay on NFC-equipped watches, and more.

And now Google has decided that that feature and some others are a mandatory part of Android. Google has updated its Compatibility Definition Document for Android to include new features that device makers must include if they want the Play Store and Google Apps on their products. As noted by Android Police, those features include the aforementioned direct reply, updating and removing apps, and bundled notifications. Device makers are also required to enable users to access the control panel from the notification shade. This feature is often referred to as the quick settings. The goal of these rules is to help ensure that Android users can have a more consistent experience from one device to another. All of the features named in this latest version of the CDD are pretty nifty and make using an Android device a better experience, and so it’s good to see Google making them mandatory for any device maker that wants the Play Store and Google Apps.

The new initiative might limit the power of internet companies when it comes to collecting user data for various purposes. Targets include Facebook, WhatsApp, Google, Apple and pretty much any other company that handles any sort of user data. The new initiative might, for example, force Google to stop reading your Gmail to serve targeted ads without your approval. Don't Miss: Company that made exploding Galaxy Note 7 batteries announces breakthrough for electric cars The European Commission said in a press release on Tuesday that it proposes a “high level of privacy rules for all electronic communications and updates data protection rules for EU institutions.” The updated rules would treat telecom operators and internet service providers similarly when it comes to the handling of user data. Internet companies including Facebook, WhatsApp, Google, Apple, and others would have to guarantee that messages, voice calls, and email conversations are confidential. The new proposed laws would also affect cookies, which companies can use for various purposes including tracking users online. The new rules should make users “more in control of their settings, providing an easy way to accept or refuse the tracking of cookies and other identifiers in case of privacy risks.” Users will have to explicitly opt-in when it comes to sharing data with third parties. Services that use location data and other metadata would still be available to internet companies, and the EU believes they’ll bring over new business opportunities. But privacy has to be guaranteed, and businesses would have to ask for consent before using any data from their customers. “Privacy will be guaranteed for both content and metadata derived from electronic communications (e.g. time of a call and location),” the EU writes. “Both have a high privacy component and, under the proposed rules, will need to be anonymized or deleted if users have not given their consent unless the data is required for instance for billing purposes.” Naturally, the proposal was met with some opposition, with the European Telecommunications Network Operations (ETNO) arguing that the new rules would still put more pressure on traditional telecom companies.

Promise. 16 January 2017 03:23 (South Africa) Media Fake it till you make it: What is SA doing about its fake news problem? Rebecca Davis Rebecca Davis Rebecca Davis studied at Rhodes University and Oxford before working in lexicography at the Oxford English Dictionary. After deciding she’d rather make up words than define them, she returned to South Africa in 2011 to write for the Daily Maverick, which has been a magnificilious decision.   Media 11 Jan 2017 11:27 (South Africa) There’s an alternative world in which Desmond Tutu has passed away, a sex-tape featuring late singer Mandoza and a white woman has just been released, and men can easily circumcise themselves at home. It’s the universe in which South Africa’s fake news websites operates. Last year the country woke up to the fact that it’s not just America dealing with fake news – but has anything actually changed since then? By REBECCA DAVIS. Did you know that Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi is advising South African men to perform DIY circumcisions? Are you aware that ANC Secretary-General Gwede Mantashe has submitted his resignation to President Jacob Zuma? Has anyone told you that antiretroviral drugs fell out of EFF leader Julius Malema’s pocket during a meeting? If not, you probably don’t follow any of South Africa’s fake news websites – though you may have been urged to click on their content at the suggestion of Facebook. All these stories are untrue, yet published – without reference to their fabrication – on a number of local websites which all seem to have sprung up within the last few years. The story about Motsoaledi urging men to undertake their own snips had been viewed at least 2,500 times at last count – small fry by the standards of the mainstream media, but a fairly alarming quantity given the negative health implications. “Fake news”. It’s a phrase that few people used before late last year. In America, the issue suddenly became one of white-hot concern in the wake of the November election result, when liberals realised that a series of misleading articles about Hillary Clinton run by numerous news sites may have actively contributed to Donald Trump’s victory. South Africa was ahead of the curve in this regard. Months earlier, government departments were already issuing denials on the back of false news reports related to government function. In August 2016, the Independent Electoral Commission opened a case with the police after a website published a story claiming that almost 100,000 local government election ballot papers had been found pre-marked with ANC votes. The website responsible for that story was African News Updates, registered to one Thulani Msibi. That’s the same website that recently ran the story about men circumcising themselves at home, so there’s little evidence that even the threat of a criminal case had a chastening effect. One of the complicating factors when it comes to South Africa’s fake news problem is that there are many shades of fake, as Media Monitoring Africa’s William Bird points out. “We have found that some of these sites don’t only use made-up nonsense, but they sometimes copy directly from more reputable news sites,” Bird says. “So on a site you might find nonsense, but then also a fairly normal news story. What also makes it tricky is that our news in South Africa is often so bizarre that you could be forgiven for thinking it’s made up.” Sometimes such sites also publish basically accurate stories, but with misleading headlines. “Court Order: Pravin Gordhan Must Step Down”, reads a headline in October from the City Sun website. The real story is that activist Andile Mngxitama’s Black First Land First movement had filed papers with the North Gauteng High Court asking the court to compel Gordhan to step down. Many would say that mainstream media outlets are often guilty of the same disassociation between headline and story, albeit not to the same degree. So, is the phenomenon something to be concerned about? The South African National Editors’ Forum (SANEF) certainly thinks so, warning in September last year of the “alarming trend” of fake news websites publishing inaccurate information. Government followed suit a month later, saying this false information “can be harmful to the citizens and the country as a whole”, and urging South Africans to exercise caution when sharing news online. But government also reminded South Africans that if a fake news website was identified as such, there is recourse. “The Electronic Communications and Transactions Act of 2002 states that Internet Service Providers Association (ISPA) has a mandate to shut down websites that are not credible,” communications director-general Donald Liphoko said. “Therefore, members of the public are encouraged to approach the internet service provider directly to lodge a complaint.” A Daily Maverick inquiry to the Internet Service Providers Association as to whether any websites have been shut down in this way thus far went unanswered. At least one local fake news site has met its end as a result of action taken against it, however. A website called T1meslive, which was clearly seeking to capitalise off the similarity in its name to the legitimate TimesLive site, received its comeuppance in October last year. That was after TimesLive took the owners of T1meslive to the South African Institute of Intellectual Property Law (SAIIPL) in October last year. In its complaint, TimesLive raised its concern that the T1meslive administrators “might be seeking to damage the TimesLive brand”. SAIIPL found that what was happening there was a form of “typosquatting”, the term for when people deliberately register misspelled domain names in order to drive traffic to their website. In the past, the owners of “standerdbank.co.za”, “sterkinikor.co.za” and “kalula.co.za” have all been slapped down. In the case of T1meslive, the SAIIPL determined that a different type of typosquatting was occurring: “In this case, the misspelled domain name clearly intends to gain legitimacy in the eyes of the unsuspecting reader of its news site, based on the reputation of [TimesLive]”. The domain T1meslive was duly transferred to TimesLive, which promptly shut the site down. The owner of T1meslive never showed up to contest the charge, so his or her identity was never revealed. This is the case for almost all the owners of these sites, who seem determined to remain anonymous even at the risk of losing their domains. They also tend to use bylines of imaginary journalists; often white women. A site called Live Monitor features countless articles by one “Karen van Vreden”, who does not exist. Neither does “Jade Wilsons”, who is responsible for most of Gossip Mill Mzansi’s stories. Jade Wilsons is described on the site as a “down to earth entertainment blogger”, but her profile pic is taken from a Pinterest board about African-American bridal hair. Why bother setting up a fake news site? There are a few possibilities. One is that the website is established as part of a misinformation campaign for political gain, as the Mail & Guardian suggested might be the case with the City Sun website, which tends to publish fabricated pro-ANC and anti-opposition stories. Another possibility is that the website is intended to sabotage or undermine mainstream news sites, as TimesLive seemed to be suggesting in its complaint against T1meslive. The most likely motivation, however, is that people are creating fake news sites for money: in particular, the ad revenue. A Buzzfeed investigation last November found that students in Macedonia were making $5,000 per month from ad revenue generated from fake news sites about the US elections. In response to this, Google announced it was taking steps to crack down on such sites by banning them from using Google AdSense. Contacted by Daily Maverick to find out if any South African sites have yet received this treatment, Google South Africa said it could not comment on individual sites. “We have updated our publisher policies and now prohibit Google ads from being placed on misrepresentative content,” a Google spokesperson said. “Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher’s content, or the primary purpose of the web property.” This would seem to apply to at least 10 local websites identified by Daily Maverick. The Google spokesperson added that the public can report “misrepresentative content” to Google here. Even if Google does take action against the sites, it may not strip them of a revenue stream. Local site Mzansi Live – which is currently leading with a fabricated story headlined “Caster Semenya jets off to Korea for penis transplant”, alongside accurate news reports – responded to an inquiry from Daily Maverick with advertising rates stretching to almost R13,000 per month. The site sent evidence that it was averaging 70,000 views per day. Some of the sites are clearly aware of the crackdown on fake news – and even go so far as to take a swipe at fake news. In an Inception-esque twist, for instance, Live Monitor is currently running a story correcting the claim of another website that gospel star Lundi Tyamara had died. “A report by what appears to be a fake website claimed the award-winning singer had died,” it reads. “The fake story has since gone viral, with fans on social media expressing shock over Lundi’s “death”. To put this into perspective, Live Monitor’s current lead story is a made-up account of a sex orgy that occurred at a Gauteng school. African News Updates, meanwhile, takes pains to explain why it is not a fake news website. “Our articles are satirical,” it states. “We are not a fake news website. Fake news websites promote propaganda, we make fun of actual events.” Satire, it appears, is in the eye of the beholder – as is what constitutes fake news. Other articles devoted to the phenomenon of South African fake news have cited as an example the site Viral Bru, which appears to mostly share viral videos. The owner of Viral Bru, who preferred to be identified only as William, was adamant in his response to Daily Maverick when approached. “Viral Bru is the furthest thing from a fake news site. What is fake about the content we share on our site?” William asked. “We are a website that tries to source new/fresh/viral content as soon as it comes out. Period.” Asked if the site takes any steps to verify the authenticity of the material it posts, he replied: “We try our best… but this is not always possible. If we feel something is not legit, we don’t share it.” The distinction between very poor attempts at satire and fake news is sometimes hard to draw, which is the defence that fake news websites can hide behind. Media Monitoring Africa’s Bird says the organisation is working on developing “a simple click button option, where the user can click to see if the article is fake or not”. As Google and Facebook have already discovered, however, the classifications are often not clearcut. In the interim, Bird has some practical advice for readers unclear as to whether the news they are consuming is factual or not. “Fake news websites seek to avoid lawsuits, so they tend not to name sources, or use made-up names,” he says. “If the news story involves a famous person, check other news sites or social media – chances are that a big breaking story like that will be on other sites as well. If it isn’t, hold off sharing until you have verified it.” Bird says too that any reputable news site will list a way of contacting it. Another tip: “Check the advertising. If the first ads you see are for porn or dodgy services, don’t trust the site.” DM Rebecca Davis Rebecca Davis Rebecca Davis studied at Rhodes University and Oxford before working in lexicography at the Oxford English Dictionary.

Handsets project echoes and screeching while users attempt to put a call on speakerphone. Several Nexus 6 users have taken to Google’s forums and the Android Open Source Project Issue Tracker for a resolution. So far, the only suggestion has been muting the device’s microphone while on speakerphone. However, that is not a long-term solution. Google has not laid out a fix for the Android 7.1.1 Nougat problem as yet. It remains to be seen if Google will even address the issue. Due to its age, pundits expect the Nexus 6 may not receive further updates.

Sony Sold As Many PSVRs As It Could Ship to Retail, But Samsung Is the Biggest Brand in VR By Bryant Frazer   /   Jan 11, 2017 Expectations for the VR market are running high, with vendors, content creators and enthusiasts alike predicting robust growth in demand for head-mounted display hardware. But many observers still remember the broken promises, not so long ago, that stereo 3D would become so popular that every television sold in the U.S. would have 3D playback capability. And we know how that worked out. It's early days for VR technology, to be sure. But how is the outlook shaping up? Well, different analysts see the market in different ways. Here's a summary of where we stand, using projections released in a flurry at the end of last year, as researchers began prognosticating about the success of VR in 2016 and beyond. The most expansive view of the market comes from IDC, which counts all types of 360-degree viewing devices in its tally. The firm figures 10.3 million units were shipped in 2016. That number doesn't include "simplistic" headsets like Google Cardboard, but it does count standalone HMDs (like Microsoft's Hololens and Epson's Moverio) as well as screenless viewers like Google's Daydream View and Samsung's Gear VR — the latter a powerhouse in this emerging market. At CES last week, Samsung America announced that it sold 5 million of the headsets in 2016, putting it on top of the heap. Sony seems to be in second place, with its PlayStation VR (PSVR) widely thought to have rocketed out of the gate in the last three months of 2016, despite struggling with shortages of AMOLED panels — which are becoming popular for smartphones, putting the squeeze on supplies to makers of HMDs. But while there's general agreement that Sony had a good holiday season, nobody is  sure just how many PSVR units the company has managed to ship. TrendForce expects software sales to match hardware sales in driving the market starting in 2020. Researcher Trendforce said it expected Sony to come out of 2016 with about 1.5 million units shipped into retail, giving it a comfortable lead over rivals Oculus (which shipped an estimated 650,000 Oculus Rifts) and HTC (an estimated 460,000 Vive shipments). But another analyst, Canalys, is more bearish. It figures trouble sourcing OLED displays limited Sony to just 800,000 PSVR units shipped. Further, Canalys says the HTC Vive is the number three headset, with about 500,000 shipments in 2016, followed by the Oculus Rift with just under 400,000. Note: Figures do not include "mobile VR" headsets, such as Samsung Gear VR and Google Daydream View. Source: Canalys Add up those numbers and you'll see that the estimates really do vary widely. Trendforce sees about 2.6 million headsets shipped from those three vendors at the end of 2016, while Canalys reckons the number is just 1.7 million. That's a pretty big difference.  Either way, all of the other vendors seem to be swamped right now by the Gear VR. (The other obvious big player in mobile VR, Google's Daydream View, didn't begin shipping until November, limiting its numbers for the year.) Samsung's success in the nascent VR market has been driven by in-store demos and bundled sales with the company's smartphones, and that bodes well for the PSVR, which will similarly benefit from increased awareness and, presumably, bundling deals with the PlayStation console — at least once Sony gets to a position where it has plenty of units in retail channels and ramps up promotion of the device. But, for now, Samsung is the best-known brand in VR. Figures from ReportLinker, which conducted an Internet survey with 738 respondents after the holiday season, indicate that the Samsung Gear is the big standout in terms of market awareness, with 58% of survey-takers saying they had heard of the device. Google Cardboard came in second at 32%, followed by the Oculus Rift at 31%. Only 25% said they hadn't heard of any VR devices, down 25 points from the last time the survey was conducted, in September 2016.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Following a major delay at the end of last year, Google may finally be ready to launch Android Wear 2.0 early next month, according to a notice sent to developers. Google hasn’t officially announced the news but the search giant previously said the update, which was introduced at I/O last May, would be out at the beginning of this year. The notice gets straight to the point. Here it is in part: Hello Google Play Developer, Android Wear 2.0 is launching in early February 2017. It includes a new on-watch Play Store to help users discover apps right on their wrist. The notice basically tells developers to update their app so it’s compatible with the newest update, otherwise it won’t be searchable in the on-watch Play Store. Does this mean Google’s watches will launch soon? Back in December, Google confirmed it would be launching two Android Wear devices in the first quarter of 2017. According to Jeff Change, product manager of Android Wear at Google, the devices won’t have Google or Pixel branding, but instead feature the branding of the manufacturer that made them. It’s unclear, however, which company Google partnered with to make the Android Wear devices. The document sent to developers doesn’t specify a final release date, so all we have to go on is “early February 2017.” Seeing as Google is reaching out to developers about the update’s imminent arrival, chances are the search giant will share more official details soon.

He called for a suite of innovations in processors, memories, interconnects, and packaging. “The slowdown in Moore’s law and the growth of cloud services has brought us to an inflection point,” said Prasad Sabada, a senior director of operations who oversees sourcing for Google’s data center hardware. “The game is changing again and we need the industry to respond in a meaningful way.” Specifically, he called for processors optimized to reduce latency in context switching and other operations key to Google’s actual workloads. “We’ve seen many processors optimized for Spec [a synthetic benchmark], but at Google, our workloads differ significantly from Spec.” Google also wants memory chips with lower latency. “We can get as much bang for the buck improving memory latency as processor performance,” said Sabada, pointing to promising work on new memory architectures. Nearly a year ago, rival Facebook came out in support of Intel’s 3D XPoint memories, which promise improvements over today’s NAND flash. Intel started limited sampling of the chips late last year. In interconnects, today’s typical “processor bus has a lot of overhead accessing I/O and accelerator devices” and is not suited to emerging memory architectures, he said. In addition, optical interfaces such as silicon photonics are needed to link servers in the data center. Sabada called out IBM’s OpenCAPI interface as one effort it supports. He did not mention two separate efforts launched last year, CCIX and GenZ, for open interfaces for accelerators and storage-class memories, respectively.

"Beyond 7nm" applies to TSMC, maybe Samsung. But generally I had intended... 1/15/2017 4:25:42 PM Gondalf Too bad actual TSMC 7nm is only a so so 10nm, in fact it is neck to neck with Intel 10nm in sram cell size. So he is almost right, nobody knows for certain what will be the real... 1/15/2017 4:00:08 PM Wilco1 Please explain this to TSMC immediately as they are ramping up their 7nm process. They would want to know FinFET doesn't work anymore... 1/15/2017 7:29:59 AM resistion I see, thanks. It looked like they were after 28nm, but could only get 40nm from SMIC at the time. 1/14/2017 2:05:45 PM alex_m1 Rsistion: Maybe this is for MCU's. 40nm-45nm is the point where leakage starts growing when you reduce dimensions.    1/14/2017 7:14:55 AM Ron Neale In my article I used the term electro-migration as a general term to cover the process of high current density element separation. I am reminded electro migration is a one directional... 1/13/2017 11:59:58 PM resistion I think they would assess how many nodes to skip. 1/13/2017 11:44:31 PM resistion It is not known if finFETs can even scale to/beyond 7nm, of course previously planned transitions would be put on hold.

Google Evan Selleck Contributing Editor | January 11, 2017 10 shares 8 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0               All throughout 2016, one of the biggest talking points of the year was virtual reality. A variety of different companies were jumping on the bandwagon, with major pushes from not only the likes of Facebook, but also HTC, Google, and others. If a company had any ability at all, or desire, they apparently were ready to go all-in with VR in some capacity or another. I don't imagine that VR is going to completely drop out of the tech industry's consciousness this year, especially considering the investment these companies have put into the effort, but I can't help but wonder if augmented reality is going to start to see a concerted effort in its direction throughout 2017, too. Google has Tango, for starters, and we're already seeing adoption right out of the gate (after a prolonged period of teasing from phone manufacturers). But it isn't just from the smartphone companies supporting this push into AR. Google announced recently that it's already got Tango in one museum, and it plans on putting Tango-enabled devices in more of them in the future. I've said this in the past: I've come around on virtual reality, but I don't think AR is going to need to try as hard as VR did. Seeing Tango in the Detroit Institute of Arts, and what it's capable of, is pretty awesome. There is a lot that AR can do to enhance the learning experience, and museums seems like a pretty perfect place to put the technology. Apple is also rumored to be jumping into the AR game with new glasses, which could even see the light of day this year. Google's already tried this with Google Glass, and while that didn't take off, it will still be interesting to see how Apple implements the technology and features. We already know that Tim Cook, the company's CEO, loves AR and thinks it's a big piece of the tech puzzle in the future, so what happens next will certainly be interesting. How do you feel about the future of augmented reality? Do you think it will be a hit, or is this a technology that won't get much traction? Let me know!

By: Prajith Sabbani Published: Thursday, November 24, 2016, 17:30 [IST] Google Now should be the blood of your Android smartphone. It started as just another way to search Google for information and has come a long way now. It has way more to it than you anticipate, for example, it can track all the data that flows through your Google account to send you relevant information via cards or push alerts. This is not the only example of what Google's digital assistant is capable of. With that being said, not many people actually know how to make the most of this feature. SEE ALSO: Live Images of Xiaomi Mi 5c Leaked Yet Again: 5 Things to Look For And that's exactly why we've come up with this article. There are plenty of things you can do with the Google Now but here are a few interesting and useful ones. Set up location-based reminders As the name itself suggests, you can use Google Now to set up location reminders so that you'll never miss out on specific things you intend to do at specific locations. To do this, press the microphone icon on the search bar and ask Google to remind you of something when you are at a particular place. It's as simple as that. Launch apps directly from Google Now Instead of opening the apps from the app drawer (if you've one) or searching for that particular app on your home-screens just say "Open WhatsApp" or "Open Facebook" or "Open any other app name" you intend to launch and boom, the app opens up. This features can come in quite handy for those who load a good amount of apps on their smartphones. Make it your travel manager Google Now can be very useful for those who travel very frequently. If you use Google's Calendar app, the digital assistant will send notifications and alert you about the same in the form of cards. What's more interesting is the fact that it sends notifications taking into consideration the time aspects as well. Meaning, in case you've to attend a party at 7:00 PM in the evening, it notifies you about when you should start from your current location to reach the destination on time.

Here's how you can spot fake news sources easily. By: Sneha Saha Updated: Monday, November 28, 2016, 18:21 [IST] Recently, after the U.S presidential election, both Google and Facebook had been accused of displaying more of fake news leading to the win of Trump. Several websites and news mediums had showcased various examples to support their statement, which is said to have played a great role behind Trump's win. However, even after several claims, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg denied the blame, but however is supposedly working on filtering out the fake news, which often misguide the users. On the other hand, Google recently revealed that it is working towards controlling the fake news flooding the internet using online advertising service, Adsense.

Name: Subject: Message: Android Wear 2.0 could officially launch in early February Newsby John Callaham4 days ago 1 471 10 Google is now informing developers that it currently plans to officially launch its Android Wear 2.0 update sometime in early February. Previously, the company said the major update to its smartwatch OS will begin rolling out in a more vague “early 2017” time frame. See also: Best Android Wear watches 7 days ago Google is sending emails to these developers informing them of the more specific launch time frame for its release so they can prepare their apps so they are compatible with Android Wear 2.0. Those apps will also be visible in the new store. One of the big features in the update is that Android Wear apps can be installed on a smartwatch without the need for a smartphone. The company has already set up a list of current and older Android Wear devices that will be able to download and install the 2.0 update. Google also plans to launch two of its own smartwatches in early 2017 that will be the first to have Android Wear 2.0 out of the box. So far, no other details on those devices have been revealed. Other companies also plan to launch their own Android Wear 2.0 products in 2017, including the Casio WSDF20, along with a currently unnamed device from ZTE. However, some companies that launched Android Wear 1.0 smartwatches in the past, most notably Motorola, have decided to put its future wearable plans on hold for the time being.

Startups are founded and collapse on a seemingly daily basis -- and Google's moonshots are no different. Alphabet confirmed to Business Insider it is killing its solar-powered drone project. 9to5Google first reported the news Wednesday. Project Titan had been part of X, or X Labs, Google's moonshot incubator. Ever since the creation of Alphabet, however, X has experienced many high-level departures, according to Bloomberg, including project leaders and engineers. Tony Fadell of Google-owned Nest, for instance, recently left. In 2014, Google, which now falls under the parent company Alphabet, bought Titan Aerospace, a firm that developed solar-powered drones. These drones were unique because they could fly at high altitudes for long periods of time, and they can collect real-time, high-resolution images of the Earth. They also feature atmospheric sensors and support voice and data services. It was presumed Google would use them to enhance its Maps offerings and to beam affordable internet onto remote, rural parts of the world with no connectivity. But now it appears neither will happen. What is Google Waymo? Alphabet also recently put Boston Dynamics up for sale and turned its self-driving car project into a standalone business called Waymo. Each of these decisions signal an effort at Alphabet to trim down and save on costs. According to a spokesperson for X, many people from the Project Titan team are still working at Alphabet but have been moved to other existing projects at X, including Loon and Project Wing. In a statement, the spokesperson said Alphabet believes Project Loon - a network of balloons designed to extend internet connectivity to people in rural and remote areas of the world - is more economical and technically feasible than Project Titan.

The California-based company says that YouTube's registration of the trademark 'Content ID' was made fraudulently and should be canceled. Automatic Content Recognition (ACR) technologies have been available to the public for a number of years. Perhaps the most visible is the mobile app Shazam, which allows users to identify the name of a song after listening to just a short clip. The same kind of technology is famously deployed at YouTube. Its (in)famous Content ID system can spot copyrighted content uploaded by users and make a decision whether to take it down or allow rightsholders to monetize it. However, YouTube now faces a legal challenge over the Content ID trademark. Audible Magic has been operating in the content recognition and fingerprinting market for more than fifteen years. In fact, during 2006, YouTube and Audible Magic signed an agreement which gave YouTube a license to use the latter’s content recognition technology. Audible Magic’s system was called Content ID, a term YouTube also uses to this day. Its agreement with the content recognition company was terminated in 2009. It’s clear the Audible Magic feels it has a claim to the name and that is the basis of the complaint the company has just filed with the United States Trademark and Patent Office. Audible Magic’s website Describing itself as “the leader in automated identification of audio and visual content for web media platforms,” Audible Magic says it has worked with the biggest names in media, including Warner Bros, Sony, Disney and Facebook. As highlighted above, between 2006 and 2009 it also worked with Google. In its complaint to USPTO, Audible Magic says that during 2006, YouTube was facing accusations that it was a “prime enabler” of copyright infringement and pirating. “The television and movie industries were complaining that YouTube was allowing third-parties to upload copyright materials from television and movies and was not instituting any controls or checks on third-party content. This negative publicity was particularly damaging to YouTube in 2006 when Google was considering acquiring YouTube for over one billion dollars,” the company writes. To address this problem, in October 2006 Audible Magic and Google signed an agreement for YouTube to license Audible Magic’s Content ID system. After YouTube had been bought by Google, the license was transferred to the search giant. The agreement between the companies was terminated three years later, at which point Audible Magic says that all intellectual property rights in Content ID reverted back to its control. However, Google applied for a Content ID trademark in 2013 and the trademark was registered in 2014. Note: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Google’s application was ongoing Google’s registration for Content ID “According to the date of first use claimed in Google’s registration, Google asserts that it first used the Content ID mark in connection with its services on August 27, 2008,” Audible Magic writes in its complaint. “Audible Magic’s date of first use of Content ID in March 2006 is thus well before the claimed first use of the mark by Google (as it should be since Google sourced the mark and related services from Audible Magic), and Audible Magic’s use of Content ID therefore has priority over Google’s use and registration.” While Audible Magic feels it has a claim over the name, one of its biggest concerns surrounds the confusion that is set to arise with Google using the term ‘Content ID’ in a marketplace already occupied by Audible Magic. “Such confusion may cause harm to Audible Magic and the consuming public and jeopardize the valuable goodwill and reputation Audible Magic has built up in connection with Content ID and its services,” the company explains. In closing, Audible Magic asks the United States Patent and Trademark Office to cancel Google’s trademark registration on the basis the company “committed fraud” in 2013 when it signed a declaration which stated that it knew of no other company entitled to use the Content ID mark in commerce. The full complaint to the USPTO can be found here (pdf) Update: “We’ve owned the trademark and built the brand around Content ID for years,” a Google spokesperson informs TorrentFreak. “There is no merit to this complaint.” Tagged in: Audible Magic, Content ID, google, youtube Newer Post Older Post Share this post: You may also like: Porn Pirate Sites Use ‘Backdoor’ to Host Videos on YouTube IFPI Sneers at YouTube’s $1 Billion Music Industry Revenue Payout YouTuber Sues Google, Viacom Over Content ID Takedowns c There are 0 comments.

By Jake Smith for iGeneration | January 11, 2017 -- 20:32 GMT (12:32 PST) | Topic: Innovation (Image: File photo) Alphabet has shuttered the solar drone division formed by its Titan Aerospace acquisition in 2014, a Google X spokesperson confirmed on Wednesday. read this Larry and Sergey's excellent adventure: Does Alphabet (formerly Google) make sense? Alphabet, the new holding company, that now includes Google is either great spin on a restructuring, savvy move or simply a way to allow Larry Page and Sergey Brin to have more fun. Read More Employees have been dispersed into other divisions at X, including Loon and Project Wing. 9to5Google first reported the move, and it comes two days after Bloomberg reported Alphabet plans to sell the Google Maps solar-imaging division formed under its acquisition of Skybox. It signals a shift at Alphabet to cut down on costly projects. When Google acquired Titan Aerospace in 2014, it was hoping the solar-powered drones could bring internet access to "millions of people" and help aid in disaster relief. It was folded into the Google "X" division in 2015 among the broader Alphabet reorganization. "The team from Titan was brought into X in late 2015. We ended our exploration of high altitude UAVs for internet access shortly after. By comparison, at this stage the economics and technical feasibility of Project Loon present a much more promising way to connect rural and remote parts of the world," a Google X spokesperson said in a statement to ZDNet. "Many people from the Titan team are now using their expertise as part of other high flying projects at X, including Loon and Project Wing," the spokesperson continued. Project Loon is Google X's project of internet-beaming balloons that it hopes will bring affordable internet to rural areas. Best Google Chrome productivity, privacy...

REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach NEW YORK Roughly one in three banking and insurance customers globally would consider switching their accounts to Google (GOOGL.O), Amazon (AMZN.O) or Facebook (FB.O) if the Silicon Valley giants offered financial services, according to a new survey on Wednesday. The survey, conducted by consulting firm Accenture, found that among 32,715 people polled in 18 countries there was broad consumer demand for banks and insurance companies to use robo-advisory services, or software propelled by artificial intelligence or less human intervention. In Brazil, 50 percent of respondents said they would be willing to switch their personal accounts. In Indonesia and Italy, 47 percent and 42 percent of respondents, respectively, said they would switch accounts. But according to the survey, if the tech titans offered those services, 31 percent of global respondents would switch to Google, Amazon or Facebook for banking, and 29 percent would switch for insurance. Already a trend in the wealth management industry, Wall Street banks and investment firms are increasingly building or buying so-called robo-advisers to provide automated investment advice through web-based platforms at a lower cost than traditional financial advisers. "(Google, Amazon, Facebook) are setting the standards in terms of customer experience and personalization," said Piercarlo Gera, senior managing director at Accenture Financial Services. Consumers look at banks and see a gap, Gera said. Google, Amazon and Facebook did not immediately respond to requests for comment. While none of these companies currently offer bank or insurance products, Google and Facebook allow users to send payments to their contacts online. Amazon has a limited service providing loans to small sellers that it selects. It is unclear whether regulations in any of the countries in which the survey was conducted would allow these companies to have banking or insurance licenses. The survey was conducted from May to June in 2016, and respondents were asked to answer questions online. When it came to specific services, more than 7 in 10 respondents said they would use robo-advice to figure out what kind of bank account to open, and nearly 4 out of 5 said they would use it for investing. But 68 percent of respondents said they did not want a robot handling customer complaints, and 61 percent said they would prefer a human over an automated system for advice about complex products like mortgages. Accenture launched a partnership with Google in September for cloud, mobility and analytic strategies to clients in retail, healthcare, consumer products, energy and finance.

We saw a teaser of the big future Google has planned at CES, with Samsung’s new Chromebook Plus and Chromebook Pro advertising their support for the Google Play Store right out of the box. Now it looks like Nougat could be rolling out to a collection of Chromebooks, as one reader of Chrome Unboxed has shared a series of screenshots showcasing his Lenovo Thinkpad Chromebook running Android 7.1.1. Keep in mind this Chromebook is on the Canary channel so it receives experimental test builds. After reading this post I checked my own Samsung Chromebook 3 and was disappointed to see it doesn’t have the update. So what’s so special about Android Nougat appearing on Chromebooks? With Android Nougat came the ability to resize your apps to use them side-by-side and perform a bit of multi-tasking on your phone. While support for this feature is still spotty at best because it requires developers to support it, it’s a godsend on Chromebooks with their larger screens designed to be used in this way. Pretty soon the huge fleet of Chromebooks produced by several manufacturers will have access to millions of quality Android apps that work out of the box and provide a great user experience. With access to Android apps on Chromebooks, Google instantly becomes a more appealing alternative to traditional Windows laptops. This takes a page out of the Lenovo Yoga Book playbook and it could mean the spread of Android beyond more than just powering people’s pocket devices and wearables. local_offer    Android   Android Nougat   Chromebook   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (4) stars Further Reading Moto Z Play getting Nougat in March Galaxy S7, S7 Edge get Nougat Android Wear 2.0 coming in February according to email Nexus 6 suffers speakerphone issue Watch this crazy timeline of Android version distribution stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertLatest OxygenOS update comes to the OnePlus 3T closeOnePlus pushes the latest OxygenOS Nougat update to the OnePlus 3 and 3T After users were discovered to be unable to download apps from the Play Store, OnePlus released a bug fix update for the OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T. 2 more_vertGalaxy S8 to have IP68 rating closeSamsung Galaxy S8 is expected to feature IP68 water resistance The Samsung Galaxy S8 is rumored to have IP68 water resistance.

Fellow Canadian carriers VideoTron and Eastlink are reportedly rolling out Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow updates as well. Now that these updates are making their way to North America, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, we expect more Galaxy S6 Marshmallow updates to follow. Telus in Canada was one of the first North American carriers to confirm specific dates for the Samsung Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge and it’s finally rolling out the Galaxy S6 Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update to users. In Australia, Vodafone started rolling out a Galaxy S6 Edge Plus Marshmallow update on June 6th. The company is also now rolling out Marshmallow updates to its versions of the Samsung Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge.

The Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge Marshmallow updates arrived after a long delay. Marshmallow Features Thanks to the roll outs and the Galaxy S6 Marshmallow beta, we know what the Marshmallow update will bring to the flagship devices. As expected, Marshmallow brings changes to the update’s interface. The update replaces blue with white and it changes the look of several app icons. The update also features the popular Google Now on Tap feature that allows you to quickly bring up information on whatever you’re looking at simply by holding down the home button. It’s one of our favorite Marshmallow features. The video above outlines the key features. Samsung will be rolling out Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow, the most up-to-date version of Marshmallow from Google. The Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update brings a number of key changes to the Samsung Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge including: Additional quick settings toggles for Private Mode in the status bar. New emoji characters (Android 6.0.1 brought more than 200 to Nexus users). Improved visibility of notification panel icons. If a fingerprint isn’t recognized, users will only get vibration feedback. A new ‘Install overnight’ option that will install an update at night between 2 to 5 AM. Samsung has detailed the changes coming to the Galaxy S6 Edge’s panel, some of which can be seen in galleries above. Galaxy S5 Marshmallow Update The Samsung Galaxy S5 Android 6.o.1 Marshmallow update continues to make progress as we push into the year.

Verizon is also rolling out the Samsung Galaxy S5 Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update to its users. So is U.S. Cellular. So is AT&T after a lengthy delay.

Samsung’s Galaxy S5 Neo update is reportedly rolling out to Vodafone model in the Netherlands. The update is unsurprisingly based on Android 6.0.1. The Galaxy S5 Neo Android 6.0.1 update is also now pushing out for carriers in Canada. In Australia, Vodafone says that it’s in the process of testing a Samsung Galaxy S5 Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update. Telstra started deploying the update a few days ago. Those of you with a Samsung Galaxy S5 mini will be happy to know that Samsung’s planning to deliver a Marshmallow update to the smaller version of the Galaxy S5. The Samsung Galaxy S5 mini Android Marshmallow update just appeared at the Wi-Fi Alliance, a sign that its release is getting closer. It also looks like the instruction manual is now available, another sign that we’re getting close. The Samsung Galaxy S5 Active Marshmallow update is finally starting to roll out in the United States. AT&T recently released the upgrade and it brings a familiar set of features and enhancements to the rugged version of the Galaxy S5. From its website: Android OS 6.0 (Marshmallow) Wi-Fi Calling Video Calling Android device security enhancements Features As for the Galaxy S5 Marshmallow update itself, it reportedly comes with most of Marshmallow’s features with bug fixes, improvements to the device’s speed, and improvements to stability. The video above gives you a good look at what to expect from your Galaxy S5 Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update. Those of you with a carrier-branded model can expect some unique “enhancements” and fixes so you’ll want to dig into the change log when your update arrives. Galaxy Note 5 Marshmallow Update The Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update is now being deployed in force around the world. It’s rolling out in a number of other countries including India with the Middle East an apparent focus for Samsung right now. It’s also rolling out in Algeria, Brazil, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Malaysia, Pakistan, New Zealand, South Korea, and Australia (Optus) to name a few. U.S. and Canadian carriers are also in the mix. The Verizon Galaxy Note 5 Marshmallow update is available and it brings new features and enhancements to its version of the flagship smartphone. The carrier is also rolling out a smaller bug fixer that alleviates three problems with Marshmallow: Trouble connecting to the internet Frequent data disconnection Problems while loading files or web pages Sprint is also rolling out the Galaxy Note 5 Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update to users taking the flagship phone up from Android 5.1.1 Lollipop. As expected, the change log is similar to the other Galaxy Note 5 Marshmallow updates that’ve rolled out elsewhere in the U.S. and around the world. Like the others, it comes with a number of enhancements, features and fixes. Sprint’s updates typically take one to two weeks to complete so Galaxy Note 5 users will want to keep an eye out this week and next for Android 6.0.1. Elsewhere in North America, U.S. Cellular’s confirmed a Galaxy Note 5 Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow roll out via its website. Like its Galaxy S6 updates, the listing contains a link to download via Samsung’s Kies app for PC. T-Mobile is also rolling out Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow to the Galaxy Note 5. The update should be available to all users right now. And finally, after weeks of silence, the AT&T Galaxy Note 5 Marshmallow update is rolling out to users around the country. Samsung recently updated its version of the Galaxy Note 5 Marshmallow update with several improvements including Wi-Fi calling and Advanced Messaging. The update also delivers new security patches. As for Canada, the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update has reportedly landed for users on Bell and Telus. It’s also rolling out to customers on Rogers. In Australia, popular carrier Vodafone is pushing out a Galaxy Note 5 Android 6.0.1 update. So is fellow Australian carrier Telstra. Features Thanks to the beta and the public roll out, we know what to expect from the Galaxy Note 5 Marshmallow update and its features. The video below shows off the early software and it runs down many of the important changes. For more on the Marshmallow leak, take a look at this full rundown from XDA-Developers. It reviews the update’s early performance. For a more recent set of photos, take a look at these Galaxy Note 5 Marshmallow photos. Verizon’s run down of the Marshmallow update will also give you a feel for the changes. In addition to the new features and enhancements, it also looks like the Galaxy Note 5 Android 6.0.1 update is plagued with issues including battery drain, issues with Gear VR and other smaller bugs. These issues have extended to the Verizon Galaxy Note 5 Android 6.o.1 update. Verizon users are already starting to complain about battery drain, Wi-Fi problems and more. We expect complaints to pick up as the roll out picks up speed. It’s not clear how these problems will impact the overall speed of the roll out (it doesn’t appear to have slowed it down yet) but Galaxy Note 5 users will want to be cautious when Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow arrives. Galaxy Note 4 Marshmallow Update The Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and the Galaxy Note Edge will both receive Marshmallow updates in the United States and the first batch of updates are pushing out right now. Sprint is reportedly pushing out its version of the Galaxy Note 4 Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update right now. The U.S. Cellular Galaxy Note 4 Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update appears to be rolling out as well. U.S. Cellular’s website confirms the release of its Galaxy Note 4 Android 6.0.1 update. The update mirrors the other Galaxy Note 4 updates in the United States. Verizon is also rolling out its version of the Galaxy Note 4 Android 6.0.1 update. According to Big Red, the update “has been tested to optimize device performance, resolve known issues and apply the latest security patches.” The Verizon Galaxy Note Edge Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update is also rolling out bringing new features, security patches and bug fixes to the curved version of the Galaxy Note 4. After a long wait, AT&T is also rolling out its Galaxy Note 4 and Galaxy Note Edge Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow updates. Both updates feature: Android Marshmallow Operating System Video Calling Advanced Messaging Wi-Fi Calling And finally, T-Mobile is rolling out both the Galaxy Note 4 and Galaxy Note Edge Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow updates to its user base. The carrier’s updates bring new features but they also bring bug fixes and enhancements that should help to stabilize the software on board. In Canada, Rogers confirms it’s finally rolling out its version of the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Android 6.0.1 update. As for the rest of the world, the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update is rolling out in Europe for the SM-N910C in Poland, users in Croatia, Germany, Korea, Austria, Italy, and its reportedly available for Galaxy Note 4 users in Uzbekistan (SM-N910H). Galaxy Note 4 users in India should also be on the lookout for a new Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update. Samsung is reportedly rolling out a new Android 6.0.1 build to the aging former flagship right now. Marshmallow is also now pushing out for Galaxy Note 4 models in Australia. Those with the Galaxy Note 4 there should check to see if an OTA is available. As for the Galaxy Note Edge Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update, it’s reportedly pushing out in England at the moment. It also looks like it’s starting to roll out to the unlocked version of the Galaxy Note Edge in other parts of Europe and to models in Canada. It’s moving like a slug compared to Samsung’s Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow roll out for the Galaxy Note 4 but we expect it to pick up speed in the weeks ahead. Features Thanks to these roll outs, we know what the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update looks like. The Galaxy Note 4 update comes with the new Air Command menu that’s found on the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy Note 5. There are also some new icons for applications. Similar to the Samsung Galaxy S6’s update. It also reportedly comes with the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 feature that allows you to take notes when the screen is off. Others In addition to updates for these popular devices, Samsung is rolling out a number of other Marshmallow updates around the world. Samsung is now pushing the Android 6.0.1 update to the Galaxy A9, a 6-inch smartphone that’s available in limited markets. The Galaxy A9 Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update is reportedly available for the SM-A9000 model in China. The company’s also deployed the first Galaxy A7 and Galaxy A5 Marshmallow updates. The Android 6.0.1 software is reportedly rolling out to Galaxy A7 and Galaxy A5 models in Russia. The A7 update is also pushing out in Europe. The Galaxy A5 Marshmallow update is also pushing out to Canadian users. Telus recently confirmed the start of the roll out. Look for both of these updates to pick up speed in the weeks ahead. The update is also rolling out to Samsung’s budget line of devices. The Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update has reportedly made its way over to the Galaxy J5 in India and Europe. Like Samsung’s other Marshmallow upgrades, it brings some huge changes to the device. Samsung’s Galaxy Tab S2 Android 6.0.1 update has started to roll out. The upgrade rolling out right now in Germany for the 9-inch model. It brings well-known Marshmallow features and it also brings a multi-user mode. This mode allows you to create separate accounts for family members and friends. A few more notes: The Galaxy Tab S2 9-inch Marshmallow update is also reportedly pushing for the 4G model in the Netherlands. The Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update is now rolling out for the 8-inch Galaxy Tab S2 in the United Kingdom. The update is reportedly similar to the upgrade for the larger version. Samsung’s Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update is also rolling out to the Galaxy Tab S2 on Rogers in Canada and Verizon in the United States. The Galaxy Tab S2 Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update has also landed for the Wi-Fi only versions of the 8-inch and 9-inch models in the U.S. The AT&T Galaxy Tab S2 Marshmallow update is rolling out right now. T-Mobile is also rolling out a Galaxy Tab S2 Marshmallow update in the United States. The update should be available OTA right now. Verizon is also now rolling out a Galaxy Tab E 8.0 Marshmallow update. It’s similar to the other Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow updates for Big Red and those who own this relatively new tablet are encouraged to check for the update right now. Android Marshmallow is also rolling out the Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4. The update is currently available for the Wi-Fi model in Europe. As for the rest of Samsung’s tablet line, the Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update is also rolling out for the first time to the Galaxy Tab A. The update is pushing out in France to the 9.7-inch Wi-Fi only variant. It’s also pushing out in Australia to the 8-inch Wi-Fi model. The update is a little over 1GB in size and it brings enhancements and new features to the slate. Look for both versions of the Galaxy Tab A Android Marshmallow update to pick up the pace in the weeks ahead. U.S. Cellular’s also reportedly started rolling out the Samsung Galaxy S 10.5 Android Marshmallow update after a long wait. Samsung Galaxy S7 Marshmallow Update As expected, the new Samsung Galaxy S7 and Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge both run the company’s Android 6.0.1 software. The two devices run a unique version of the operating system. You can get a feel for their version of Marshmallow software in the hands-on video above. It’s worth noting that the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge do not support Android 6.0’s Adoptable Storage feature, a concern given the fact that it only comes with 32GB of internal storage space in the United States. It’s also worth noting that the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge come with some additional emoji characters. A full outline of those characters can be found right here. In 2016, Samsung rolled out an “urgent” software update for the Galaxy S7 Edge. T-Mobile also pushed out bug fix updates to the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge. More recently, Samsung and its carrier partners have been rolling out updates with a Wi-Fi Calling update on board. The update’s landed for the AT&T Galaxy S7 and AT&T Galaxy S7 Edge and it checks in at 600MB in size making it a substantial release for the two flagship devices. Rogers in Canada has put out the same update for its Galaxy S7 models. It’s also important to know that the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow updates are now available online. These will be useful if you need to go back to stock software at any point during your time with the Galaxy S7. January/December Security Update Google is rolling out January security updates to its Nexus devices and Samsung is following suit with January security updates of its own. Samsung’s December security patch has landed for select devices including the Samsung Galaxy J7, the Samsung Galaxy S7, the Galaxy S7 Edge, and the Galaxy Note 5. We expect the January security patch to be included in some of the company’s upcoming Android 7.1.1 Nougat updates. As for the contents of the December/January patches, Samsung’s latest security updates come with several important patches and you can read the specific patch notes on the company’s website. Be on the lookout for your January/December security patches as we push deeper into the month. We expect more regions and more devices to get the update in the days ahead. Android Nougat The Marshmallow update roll out will push into 2017 though its been joined by Samsung’s Android 7.1 Nougat roll out for Galaxy devices. The company says it plans to start the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge Nougat roll outs in January and it looks like some users are already getting their taste of Nougat. Two carriers in Australia are already testing the Android Nougat update and one plans to roll it out sometime in January. There’s also chatter about a January 17th release date in Europe. Point is, we’re extremely close to the Nougat roll out which means we’re extremely close to potential fixes for lingering Marshmallow issues. The company’s Galaxy Android Nougat update will bring substantial changes to the Samsung Galaxy S7, Samsung Galaxy S6, Galaxy Note series, and others. We expect the roll out to take place over the course of 2017. For more information on the Android Marshmallow’s successor, take a look at our Samsung Galaxy Android Nougat roundup and our Android 7.1 walkthrough. Samsung’s Android Nougat update will bump devices from Android 6.0.1 to Android 7.1.1. 10 Things to Do Before Installing Samsung Galaxy Marshmallow Get Familiar with Android 6.0.1 & Marshmallow   1 / 10 Let's start with something very important.  One of the first things you'll want to do is get familiar with the changes coming with your version of Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. Each update is going to be a little bit different (carriers can't help themselves) but there some core elements to each.  There are a number of resources around the web but we'll provide you with some great starting points right here.  We've taken a deep dive into the differences between Lollipop and Marshmallow and you'll want to check the basics out so that you're comfortable with the changes.  Android 6.0.1, the version of Marshmallow rolling out to Galaxy devices, is a little different than Android 6.0. You can get familiar with some of Android 6.0.1's basics right here. And then we get to the device level. That is to say that the Galaxy S6 Marshmallow update is a little different than the Galaxy Note 5 Marshmallow update. We've outlined some of those differences and you can find them at the links provided.  Things will be different at the carrier level as well and you'll want to look into those changes as well. Unfortunately, those changes will arrive whenever Samsung and your carrier decide to push out Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow for your device. We'll provide you with the Verizon Galaxy Note 5 Marshmallow release notes as an example.  If you haven't been following along, now is a great time to look into the new features and enhancements so that you're as proficient as possible after you download and install Marshmallow on your Galaxy phone or tablet.    1 / 10 351 Responses 01/06/2016 Ben Reply i dont see any difference in this version and what I am currently running on my S^ which I just got a few days ago. The hype and the hype over a few stupid changes is crazy. You guys in the media have to stop making things bigger than what they are, When a MAJOR change occurs, then hype and push it. Marshmallow is not a big deal. 01/12/2016 mnet Reply Marshmallow is hug Ben. It is huge because of the features you will get to control app permissions. The “wild west” days of Android apps with their crazy permissions is coming to an end. If you have not discovered all the features of 6.0 yet its because you have not looked into what is really there but instead troll the web. 01/26/2016 Emma William Reply Samsung starts rolling out January security update for its flagship smartphones including Galaxy S5 04/03/2016 Elijah Abeyta Reply You’re mistaken. This update is about the marshmallow 6.0.1 and you must be talking about marshmallow 6.0 04/18/2016 William Ernst Reply The update sucks if you have an S5, as it has eliminated the feature that lets you transfer applications to the SD card 05/19/2016 Jamario Souza Reply The worst thing after this update is that I simply lost LTE connection. Only acces 3G. With Android 5 I could manage Network Band and select my prefered band, but now I have no access to it. In March it updated to Android 6.0, this month it updated to 6.0.1 and the shit continues. I cannot unlock phone using fingerprint after rebooting phone. It seems to me that Android M has taken a step backwards with my device.

Here’s what I’ve been doing>> USA Jobs Resort 04/14/2016 Robert Reply I disagree. I’ve had my S6 for several months on Lollipop, finally got the update to Marshmallow from Verizon a couple weeks ago and I’m really enjoying it. My S6 has much better battery life and it performs much better in benchmarks and normal use. It’s smoother (not as laggy), apps load faster, messaging is more streamlined (no more waiting to take and send pics through text), and total control of app permissions (finally). Marshmallow is a major update and I couldn’t be happier with it. It’s just a shame it took so long to actually get it. 06/21/2016 laurarussell532 Reply I found a great site that focuses on stay at home mom’s complete guide to gaining a serious amount of money in very little time.

If it’s not resolved within the two year update I’m moving to iOS. I rather deal with a company that updates regular and is more restrictive about what you can have than a company that takes months and months to update their devices. 01/11/2016 Taha Reply Chuck. Buying a nexus gives you instant apple style hardware and software updates. Cheers 01/12/2016 mnet Reply I agree with you to a point. But you have to ask yourself are you looking for updates for the sake of just getting something “new”? Most updates are minor, granted 6.0 is no minor update.

I s that the January security update? In any case, I have managed to remove some of the Samsung bloatware (I wish I could ger rid of the awful TouchWiz panels too), so I am not risking getting all that crap back by accepting any non essential upgrades. 02/01/2016 Bishal Khan Reply I am using s6edge plus I think that samsung should give Marshalltow on it please 03/03/2016 Nick Stanizewski Reply Seriously? Your phone came out in September of last year. Try dealing with the frustrations of having a note 4 on verizon. Hahahahahaha your comment really did make me laugh. Crying you don’t have marshmallow. I went as far as going out and buying a tablet so I didn’t have to deal with that garbage phone as much. Have fun with samsung. I’m going to stock android, close to it, or at the worst LG unless they start playing the samsung when are you getting your update game also. 03/18/2016 Kim Griffiths Reply I finally got Marshmallow yesterday (17 March 2016) on my Edge +. I think that it’s going to be another couple of months before I see it on my Note 4. But some great additions I didn’t expect…they’ve added scrolling screenshot functionality & the Edge is, at last amazing with half screen functionality and loads upon loads of Edge improvements. Battery life seems far better. I haven’t really dug in to fund everything yet, but so far as great improvement.

Had the S3, Note 10.1 (2012) and now Note 4 and always the same with lack of updates or extremely slow to update. Samsung needs to stop making dozens of devices with then dozens of variants of the same device! This is why they can’t update in a timely manner. If Google and Apple can make their device line up simple then so can Samsung! If Apple and Google can bypass carriers for updates and send them direct to users then so can Samsung. Until Samsung smartens up, they have lost me as a customer! Next phone will either be a Google Nexus device or (I hate to say and even think it but) iOS. I left Apple for Android but Google hates sd cards, all other manufacturers are slow to update. It’s ridiculous! Also the fact Samsung is removing the “adoptable storage” feature from their Android 6.0.1 updates is ridiculous! It’s a Google feature and Samsung and LG should have no right to remove/disable it. Give us the choice FFS! F U SAMDUNG! 02/25/2016 Too Squat Reply Note 4 owner…I think this is my last Samsung. I bought it because of the pen. Used to be an HTC buyer, they converted me to Android.

This is like reading the same thing over and over and over again. 4 months into Marshmellow and barely any devices have recieved it. Pathetic. Carriers suck with the added bloatware but it shouldn’t be this damn complicated. The real reason for the wait, S7 and S7 Edge. Gotta make sure as many people buy the latest and greatest before taking care of their actual customers first. Yes, its a business but wow…get the ball rolling Samsung or you’ll be losing about 100 people I know who’d love to try Apple. I love Android but sooooooooooo slow. 02/27/2016 Abhishek Reply Thanks for this Information. 02/27/2016 David Reply When will marshmallow update be on the s6 verizon? 02/28/2016 Mike Venturini Jr. Reply David, When you buy a S7.

Sir….. 02/29/2016 ThisGuyEntitledMuch Reply wow 02/29/2016 Charles Reply To the coders, thanks and all that… I’m sure that you busted a gut over this thing. but, Marshmallow doesn’t appear to be worth the risk of bricking your phone. You got Lollipop working ok.. You even dumped out a security patch. It works… It works well… The phone works as advertised. 6.0 and/or 6.0.1 for all the fanfare and hooplah… just doesn’t seem like it’s worth the risk. Maybe after 6.0.1 gets debugged… and/or maybe a 6.0.2 rolls out – or, maybe after the security fixes for it hit the bricks… It’ll be mature to a point where it’ll install and do what it’s supposed to do without doing any harm…. That could be a year away. Hell, there is even super hype blurting out over Android N… – and, they haven’t delivered 6.0.1… Why not talk about O and P while you’re at it…. There are still a lot of un-used letters in the alphabet. There is little or no talk about a USA release… thank god. It has to start out in S. Korea… and work its way west thru Bangladesh and Botswana. Sure, fine… brick pygmy phones if you have to. Don’t release the >1Gb bloat code here – until it works… It doesn’t even have to deliver the BS hype… just don’t brick my phone. and, If at all possible – don’t gut any useful functionality – that I had in Lollipop… We all know BS when we hear it. We know it won’t do all that you say it will do…. In short.. Do no harm… Don’t release an OS that is worse than the one we got. 02/29/2016 Bharath Reply Any chance of Touchwiz update on note 4? 03/01/2016 Young_Android_Runner Reply 29Feb2016 > Marshmallow isn’t here yet but we’re already hearing about a potential successor to the Marshmallow update Huh?

The phone has gotten smoother but there isn’t any change in battery performance, at least nothing yet. A couple of features have disappeared. Like, now I cannot define the pattern of vibration when a phone rings. Bummer. I liked that. Second, while waking up the phone, the screen-light come on really slowly. Third, the Settings aren’t all same like Galaxy S7. There is no triple-press home button for one-hand use feature. Fourth, Galaxy Labs is absent. Oh well, can’t think of more at the moment. There are many more, though. Disappointing, Samsung.

Clear all cache and see if it helps. It may be in settings or you may have to enter device recovery by turning it off then holding either the up or down volume while also holding power while it starts. Google search for your correct way of entering recovery. Then when you do get there, use volume keys as directionals to select clearing system cache. OK that by the power key. Then select reboot and OK it by the power key.

If you don’t have it and don’t care, you still didn’t need to post. Let us rant and why don’t you stay quiet? Samsuck is notorious for sending out upgrades late, thanks to their crappy touchwhiz garbage. They have to make sure the newest OS is working with that and thus it takes the longest. This is my first and last samsuck device, not only because of late OS updates (and N is right around the corner), but also because of their rapid charging mode. It wears out their batteries and people have to go buy new ones after about a year. My iPhone 5 that I gave my wife, I bought at launch and it is still working flawlessly on the same battery. My samsuck nope 4 is not holding the charge it once did because of its battery issue. I won’t be buying a new battery, however, I will be buying a new phone. And if I have to sell a kidney to afford and iPhone then so be it. 03/22/2016 Mathew Bolles Reply I received my update on my US Cellular S6 two days ago.

From what I can tell…. No one involved in the process seems to know what the process is. Supposedly, it is really rolling out some where… Botswana… Bangladesh… the Punjab in India. It is rolling of obscure tele-cos… with 10s of 100s of customers… The smaller the better. No projected or predicted or implied delivery dates have been met – any where. Those that got it – and, it worked – don’t seem to have a problem with it… even if it comes with its own completely new set of anomalies. Those that got it and it bricked their devices… simply disappear into non-digital existence. There seems to be some people that may or may not have it… that just love it to death. They are others seeing it as a cure for imagined ills. Then their are a few walking wounded that actually did get it… And, it didn’t deliver as promised. Bottom Line…. So far, it’s a huge non-event… and, that may be the good news… Some devices are skipping this promised land – for the next new – not quite there – version N. Which one must assume will be as nebulous as the nearly existent Marshmallow. This would all be a horrible fate if there was a problem with Lollipop to begin with. Fortunately, Lollipop isn’t all that bad. These promised improvements are like chasing mirages in the dessert… That can be a real problem if you are dying of thirst. The problem for the Android Overlords is that they can’t get any one thirsty for the new products…. Rumors, innuendos, and power of suggestion will only get you – but, so far. Plus, if you deliver one of these half-baked products – and, it bricks millions of devices… that a hell-of-a-lot of negative advertisement to get over. So, the latest update on the update… is that it is still kind of there but not there. No carrier has a completed roll out for all their devices. No device manufacturer has a completed roll out for all their makes and models on all carriers. There isn’t even a single device that is up and running on all carriers. It’s just one very specific make, model, – possibly even a specific block of serial numbers – within a model… pops up with a roll out on – one very specific carrier – usually some where outside the US. This is touted as progress…. Where – in comparison – Apple pulls a roll out and gets 80% of their products updated in a month… Still, ya have to admit…. Marshmallow is worth every penny ya paid for it. 03/24/2016 Jeffrey Gohlke Reply US Cellular S6 updated to 6.0.1 today 3-24-16 03/24/2016 Thersathomas Reply 203=1m­­­­­­­­­y neigh­­­­­­­­­bor’s mo­­­­­­­­­m m­­­­­­­­­akes $80 /h­­­­­­­­­r o­­­­­­­­­n th­­­­­­­­­e int­­­­­­­­­ernet .

However the update to 6.0.1 on the note 4 has a few issues so far, after the upgrade all my Bluetooth connections were wiped out and reconnecting is an issue because I have to reboot the phone and restart the headset 1 or 2 times before the phone sees the headset, I also found that one of tge greatest additions in marshmallows has been left out of the update and that is the theme engine, I mean really what sense does it make to leave out one of the best features, please put out an update that adds this feature back. Leaving out a major update at this stage of the game makes no sense at all.

Sure, no one wants to rush anything… Why risk bricking your phone? The customers didn’t demand this. The customers aren’t really feeling the burn here… Yet, the vaguest reference of a siting in the most obscure of countries and the smallest of carriers – gets absurd pronouncements. It’ll happen when it happens. About the only good thing you can say about it – is – that it’s worth every penny you paid for it. 04/09/2016 sarcasticdave94 Reply Here’s my 2¢. I’m glad my Note 4 got it as it is an update, it looks OK and works. I don’t like that Sammy took away the ability to move apps to the SD card and that I’ve gotta put the password in every time I reboot the phone. Other methods like fingerprint scan won’t work till after it’s fully rebooted via entering the password. I don’t think I’ve got extra emoji or wherever the modified battery saver was. It did come with a generous supply of Sprint/TouchWiz bloat as usual, but maybe a bit lighter by a few percentage points. I’m glad I didn’t pay for it though. And the next device for me will be called Nexus. See what you get for 2¢. :-P 03/30/2016 Wilson Reply After running the new update my S6 now randomly re-starts itself and I would say roughly half the phone calls are going directly to voicemail.

Too many issues to mention here. My phone is messed up! 03/31/2016 Charles Reply Here we are at the close of yet another month… March 31 – with Marshmallow market share resting comfortably at 2.3%… The pundits milestones fall by the wayside once again. and, They refuse to hold silence on their accolades for 6.0.1 – that barely exists… – and, where it does exist – there is no small amount of nashing of teeth. The pundits sell great snake oil…. btw… And, what’s wrong with snake oil – you might say. When was the last time you saw a squeaky snake? oh… well… There is always April – then May – then June…. Maybe some country some where with a sizable telecom – will roll this thing out and get it to work. Buyer be ware… If you got it “on” your new device – don’t panic… it’ll probably work just fine. Upgrading older devices – is always a bit of a crap shoot. If you bought older legacy hardware and update prior to loading your old apps…. that might work ok, too.. Marshmallow isn’t all that evil… It just can’t cope with all the possible combinations of footprints left over from old OS’s and legacy apps. Nothing ever has. Nothing ever will. The glacial roll out is probably a blessing – in that it is sparing you from the infinite new anomalies that you will encounter… The purported enhancements/improvements – may – or, may not – work as advertised. but, At least, you have gotten used to the quirks in your current device. Why suffer the trials and tribulations of different quirks – whilst Beta testing the lasted flavor. I guess that I long for the daze when one could stone false prophets. Back in the good ole daze, if the prophet spoke and got it wrong – they took him out to the gates of the city and stoned him… Not much of a retirement plan… But, it really cut down on people making idiot claims and speculations. 03/31/2016 Charles Reply Verizon has already inflicted/infected the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 users with Marshmallow…. Batteries dying… WiFi croaking… no access to the AppStore… BlueTooth disconnecting…. Who will be the next victim? Will they bless the 6s class? What did they ever do the Verizon… other than subscribe. The good news here – is – that as glacial as Android is with the updates, they aren’t all that essential. The updates sell features that you have never had… you are being told that you want them. Also… it’s great that it’s free… The update is worth every penny that you paid for it. So – not getting something that you don’t need and didn’t ask for – for money that you never paid… isn’t all that bad of a deal… Then Verizon steps in with its non-value added contribution. This slows the process even further. By the time Verizon is finished bloating the code, even more lettered releases appear on the horizon… N, O, P, etc. Which may displace the much exalted M – all together… and, Is that bad? You are still not paying for it. You still didn’t ask for it. You still don’t need it. So, does it ever matter, which version of the next shiny new OS that you aren’t actually getting? The hype seems totally unaffected. These are the same guys that barely got KitKat and Lolipop to stop coughing up blood… and, those two combined only pulled 37% of the market share for Samsung. Marshmallow is languishing at 2.3% – after 4 months. This is almost as much fun to watch as MicroSloth WinWoes rolling out their free WinWoes Tin…. 03/31/2016 Amy Sweet Reply Did the Marshmallow update and I can no longer lock my phone.

Now my autocorrect replaces REAL words that I have spelled CORRECTLY with words it THINKS I meant and makes me look stupid. Someone can text and ask how I am. I reply “I’m good!” And it corrects the word good and changes it to “not” so I wind up sending “I’m not!” It’s beyond agitating!!! And if I turn it off completely, then I’m left with it correcting nothing at all. So now I’ll have to download a less idiotic keyboard to use and eastern space on my note 5 to do so. this is BS. And that’s just one of the issues. 04/13/2016 Samantha Castaneda Reply I am having the same issue. It is driving me crazy!! If you find out how to fix it, please let me know! 05/05/2016 Christina Merager Reply I’m so glad I’m not the only one. It’s absolutely driving me insane. It’s unbelievable! The fact that the word is spelled Completely correct and it just changes it??? Why?? And sometimes to just a letter! But I’ve noticed it only does it for words that you add a (?) Or (!) to the end of. Not that that helps. 04/09/2016 sarcasticdave94 Reply I just wanted to put the info out that my Sammy & Sprint Note 4 had received the Marshmallow 6.0.1 near the end of March. My update was just short of 1.4 GB. It has improved my Note by making it feel smoother and more intuitive. It seems to also be a bit lighter as in not so bloated, but I’m unable to confirm that as a fact. The only area I’m disappointed, and it’s a great disservice to us owners in my opinion, I no longer can move apps to the SD card. It’s not even accessable, as in moving apps to it, unless I’m missing something. This in my opinion is a real failure by Sammy. It just confirms my previous plan to go Nexus next time around. 04/09/2016 sarcasticdave94 Reply Sorry for my redundancy at the end there. 04/09/2016 sarcasticdave94 Reply OK so there actually IS a way to transfer files from phone memory to a mounted SD card. If anybody’s interested, I’ll post the path to get file transfers done the Marshmallow way. Standby… 04/09/2016 sarcasticdave94 Reply This may help some or all who have received Marshmallow and are having issues with the apps not acting right, the Wi-Fi or etc. This is worth trying once. Learn where you do this on your particular phone as I don’t know about all is of them. I do know I did this to my Sammy Note 4 on Sprint and it helped with crashing apps after updating. Clear all cache. Then reboot. See if it helps. Hint: some devices have a setting menu for this, others you shut off the phone then get to the restore screen to clear cache. Afterwards in either, do a reboot if possible. 04/09/2016 Landon R Caviness Reply Come on AT&T… By far the slowest carrier for updates… 04/10/2016 Ehsan Reply I am overall pleased with the marshmallow update in note 5 features are great interface just goto better, the only thing annoying to me is the grey strip on the top notification panel where battery indicator time etc are located.

Size: 1474.19 MB Version: N915PVPU4DPD1/N915PSPT4DPD1/N915PVPU4DPD1 · OS upgrade – Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow · To get the best from your device, please keep your phone up to date and regularly check for software updates. ※ Fingerprints are securely protected. An alternative unlock method (pattern, PIN, or password) is required to add fingerprints. ※ Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow does not support the Decrypt device function. If your mobile device is encrypted, encryption cannot be disabled after upgrading. If you want encryption to be disabled after upgrading, it must be disabled before you upgrade your device. To disable encryption go to Settings – Lock screen and security – Other security settings, then select Decrypt device. ※ If the Samsung Gear or Gear Fit Manager app does not work normally after this upgrade, uninstall the app, then install the latest version. This will reset your Gear to factory default settings and all data on your Gear will be erased. ※ Some apps that were installed via the Lollipop OS may need to be updated after upgrading to the Marshmallow OS. Go to Galaxy Apps or Play Store to update apps. 04/21/2016 Charles Reply Marshmallow… 6.0.1 – over hyped… bloated… non-plused…. overall = not bad. For a Samsung Galaxy s6 edge+ / with Verizon, it’s not all that bad. My phone did not brick. My phone is not coughing up blood. The battery does not die… though – I’m not quite sure that the super enhanced improvement is there… The battery is doing ok.. not noticeably worse. The graphic depiction of projected duration is longer… I haven’t tried running it out to 12 hours yet… I don’t run enough BlueTooth peripherals to show a problem… It says its still there… I’m taking it at its word. The WiFi… may have had a problem – or, not…. The home WiFi didn’t skip a beat. The historical archive of pre-existing connections did ok, too… Scanning for potential – new – WiFis could be a problem – or, not… it could just work differently. I’ve had to re-register on a couple of hubs… So far, no big deal. The phone does not get mysteriously hot… or, cold… It does not randomly buzz, vibrate, reboot – or, speak in tongues. All the apps seem to have made it. The app store(s) are still there… — there is a special permission for non-PlayStore apps… Click a button and the Amazon apps, etc… are good to go. The GPS is doing ok. It appears to be doing every bit as well as the old Lollipop… It may be a schoosh faster – snappier. Schoosh…is a technical digital device term = barely noticeable. The user interface “is” slightly different… enough to annoy… I can’t see much of a wow factor in it. The “edge” feature is different… (? better ?)… It’s only better if you were a heavy user to begin with. If you had never bonded to the feature to begin with.. this probably isn’t going to get you anymore involved. So far, Marshmallow is a benevolent improvement. It has done no noticeable harm. I haven’t lost any capabilities. It may even be an improvement – overall. I can’t dodge the feeling that I am missing something… with all the fanfare, there should be some sort of wow-factor that justifies all the hype… Sometimes ya just have to take it as it is… at least, it didn’t set me back. I would recommend it – if I only knew – why? 04/21/2016 Elle Reply Thank you 04/22/2016 Lisa Miceli Reply UGH…not a fan of the update at all.

Like the notifications are gone, developer options says “it doesn’t work for this user”, multitasking app doesn’t work, home and back button is the only one the works. Please help. 05/02/2016 Charles Reply Marshmallow 6.0.1 doesn’t seem to be all that bad…. Eventually, it automatically downloaded, then the annoying window was there for about a week every time you unlocked the screen. I finally consented for it to install… (Verizon Samsung Galaxy s6 edge plus) It blinked and buzzed… blinked some more.. went dark… for awhile… lit back up… did some more blinking… buzzed…. – after a bit, it looked like it was gunna actually do sumthun… The start screen lit up and it jingled its jangle… Then there was much flashing and an occasional buzz…. Once it finished convulsing, I went for a shut down, which it did. After a few moments of calm, I started it back up again. This time it started with less fan fare… about as quickly as Lollipop… It still wanted to do some tweaking… So, for the first half hour or so – it was clunky. Whatever the upgrade is – it takes time to digest. Over the following week or so… mileage has varied. Nothing bad… = but, no wow factor either. The battery usage is some where between psychotic and bewildering. Sometimes it predicts 8 hours… sometimes 3 days. There are weird slopes in the discharge curve, which effect the battery life prognostications. It may depend on signal strength, whether or not WiFi is enabled… and/or the strength of the WiFi signal.. It may also be effected by back ground app updates and the relative signal strengths during those processes.. and, There may be god knows what going on with apps optimizations. I have not let this thing go for 3 days and attained the promised duration… Before I could get 8hr, 12hrs… maybe 16 hrs… before an auto shut down. The best to date with marshmallow – I’ve gotten down to around 30 – 40% in power savings mode in about 22 hrs…. which is an improvement. I just don’t know if I can believe it. The digital services seem to be a bit snappier, quicker. No big difference with calls, gps, bluetooth, or WiFi… The searching and notifications of “new” WiFi signals may be different – but, the devices seems to connect to the old connections – ok. Basically, It hasn’t screwed much of anything up…. I have a very undemanding regimen for the device. What I had it doing – it still does, which is all I asked for. The new “can’t live without features” – eh… just not all that into them, yet. They aren’t bad… I bought the edge plus for the bigger screen – not so much for the edge technology. There’s nothing wrong with it… just wasn’t a big deal to begin with. With all the tapping, dragging, swiping, pinching, spreading… another way of doing the same stuff just adds another layer of confusion to the process… Still, the edge stuff works… The edge bar is bigger.. If I used it, it would be helpful. I can definitely say, that it was worth every penny I paid for it. It has done no damage. No data lost. No performance lost. No functionality lost. The learning curve for the new features is negligible. This positions the device to take advantage of new features in my existing apps. So far – so good…. It may be a benefit for battery usage and charging It will probably be better on my Samsung Galaxy Tab s2… 05/02/2016 Dustin Hall Reply My S6 updated to Marshmallow this morning and I’m getting all these errors: messaging app totally not working, laggy overload for every app, not recognizing my thumbprint, battery draining exceptionally fast.

I am an AT&T customer and like many of you I have been awaiting the Galaxy Note 4 Marshmallow update, but I have been waiting for it for very different reasons. Some owners of the phone may be waiting for it for the same reasons as well. Here is the problem:   Since the internet released that AT&T rolled out the Galaxy Note 4 Marshmallow update overseas, Google App vendors have been upgrading their softwares for the Note in anticipation of the Marshmallow Platform Update. If you are like me and you have been paying attention, these Google Play Apps update sometime 1 to 5 times weekly. With the updates being installed, the phone begins to freeze in certain applications. The phone may allow you close out the application so you may relaunch it, but in my instance this also means removing the battery cover (waiting for a time) and restarting the device. The reason I have now been told 5 times by AT&T tech reps is that the phone has not been updated with the software needed to support the updated Apps. So basically, between 1 to 6 times daily my device freezes.   Now, when I became upset about this was when I was told to upgrade to a new device, instead of being told when the Marshmallow Update would be released. Basically, my device is acting like it has a virus but is actually working as intended but is having a problem with software in Apps versus Platform issue. This meant I was being told upgrade a perfectly good working phone when there was nothing actually wrong with it. I got to thinking about how many AT&T customers are being told this, who may not be asking the right questions and I became even angrier, as they are throwing money at the company for a problem that is easily fixed:   1.       Either they indicate the Galaxy Note 4 is not going to be upgraded in the US, which causes vendors to stop notifying your phone to upgrade Apps. 2.       Or, they upgrade the phone to Marshmallow Software in the US post haste.   Basically I am outlining a very poor customer service issue. This is either due to AT&T’s negligence, Samsung’s negligence, or Googles. When you call to speak with anyone about this, they point the finger elsewhere as the problem. Warranty sent me a refurbished device to see if it will work better for me. It is on its way. I doubt it will, because of the issues I have been having. I thought I would pass this along to encourage all with a Galaxy Note 4 to call AT&T if you have been told to upgrade your device unnecessarily.   I upgrade, normally to a new phone 1x a year. As a present to myself on my birthday. This is the first time I did not upgrade as I was not happy with the lack of expandable memory in the Note 5. So I kept the phone. So now almost 2 years later, I am having all of these problems with a perfectly good phone and due to lack of SOFTWARE SUPPORT.  I hope me explaining this issues helps address your problem if you are having the same issue yourself. I encourage you to complain. Perhaps this will induce them to release the software, or finally release that they have no intention of doing so. Which also fixes the problem. 05/16/2016 Eric Johnson Reply Very nicely said. You brought out all the problems I was having. After I read your very long message, I was really with on most points. My final thought was I’m going to have to complain and complain. So like you said, complain about these issues were having. Maybe, just maybe that will work. Let’s hope that works. 05/11/2016 Shanna Hall Reply My Galaxy S6 Says That It Is Up to date But My Phone Is Still On lollipop. I haven’t even gotten the option to get marshmallow yet. I have at&t by the way. 05/13/2016 George Reply Why does this site keep showing it’s been updated with new information and staying at the top of the search engine list. Is it because of people leaving comments? It’s pretty dumb if that’s the case. There is nothing new here to read about, it’s the same info over and over again as well as people saying they got the update or complaining that android sucks and the marshmallow update ruined their phone 05/16/2016 Mike Reply Look at the date of the post. I searched it today (the 16th of May) and it says it was updated…today. I bet if I come back tomorrow and refresh it will say it was updated on the 17th. Nice trick. 05/13/2016 Wissam458s Reply Still haven’t gotten the update marshmallow for my galaxy note 4 SM-910H 05/14/2016 Giura Adrian Reply Hello, Since I upgraded to android software Marshmallow on notes 4 and I only problems for example: – Calls are heard very bad compared to the previous software. – Mirroring the screen goes wifi internet did not. – Sound comes very slowly closing or pressing keyboard. – Sta greatly from opening after restart. – A weak signal on the phone.

I think kitkat was best for galaxy s5 phones, at least all the features were present in it that time . 06/03/2016 Ed Reply Not to mention the fingerprint scanner unable to work. Rebooting has become a norm for my S5. Software seems to lag. Stick to the Lollipop 5.0 if you’re using a S5. 05/17/2016 Brodie Yg Reply Feel sorry for people that own Samsung products there so old and outdated, with an OS that’s has already been ditched by Google. Google customers are already running Android 7.0 while the rest of use wait for 6.0.1 which really offers no great new features unlike N which has inline replies split screen for multi tasking, night and day modes and hundreds of new features Samsung won’t ever get. Most Samsung’s still run lollipop, while I run the new modern OS Android 7 which came via an OTA as soon as I got my lg nexus which runs pure Android not some dodgy rip off touch wiz crap. Samsung’s owners are some of the last to ever get updates even smaller brands already have marshmallow out of the box. I also get updates before any other brand for the life of the phone not for a limited time like none Google branded phones. I like to get my updates fast not years after its release. 05/17/2016 Brodie Yg Reply And I can’t believe how people think it’s hard to find an imei number in Android it’s a 5 digut dialler code *#06# it’s that simple unlike Apple were you have to go through multiple screen to get such information. 05/17/2016 TBen Reply Te reason why most people buy Samsung phones and not Nexus is because Nexus is just a piece of crap. Google should not be in the business of making smartphones, it should stick to providing and maintain the android platform. 05/17/2016 Mike Reply This update caused my Galaxy S5 to wipe and reset to factory default. Verizon support was unhelpful. Thankfully I had a lot of data backed up to the cloud and I dumped all my pictures and videos onto my PC 2 days before this happened. Be careful with this update! 05/17/2016 JRuge Reply Do you guys ever report any NEW news and information instead of re-hashing the same information with a new date? 05/19/2016 Jamario Souza Reply With my Galaxy S5 (SM-G900K) the worst thing after this update is that I simply lost LTE connection. Only acces 3G. With Android 5 I could manage Network Band and select my prefered band, but now I have no access to it. In March it updated to Android 6.0, this month it updated to 6.0.1 and the shit continues. I cannot unlock phone using fingerprint after rebooting phone.

Stills says “T-Mobile Testing” on T-Mobile website though…so, probably a phased roll out. 05/23/2016 Charles Reply I would have preferred to have gone with Marshmallow in the Tab s2 first… The Galaxy s6 edge plus… is no big deal… At least, it didn’t go completely psychotic. The battery blather… – all the hype about improved battery performance – is a bit weird. The prognostications as to when it will die are all over the place. Sometimes it thinks that it can run for daze on the existing charge… sometimes just 6 to 8 hours… It “does” seem to re-charge faster. It doesn’t seem to be overheated when it does so. So far, it has been benevolently benign…. No lost data… No lock ups. It still works about like it did with Lolipop… I have noticed an occasional re-boot, on its own.. No boot loops. Some apps are a bit snappier and faster… some aren’t… some are the same. It could just be the calm before the storm… The chargers, the cables, the device hardware and OS have come into temporary alignment. We all know that it won’t last…. Sooner or later 5G will drop… = new hardware, new chargers and new cables… the OS will be gawd knows what by then. Enjoy it while it lasts. 05/26/2016 Jens Reply Woke up this morning to a 1500 plus mb download yay think I finally got the note 4 update from bell in Canada Hope it’s not just a security update. 05/26/2016 Steve Reply Got an update on Galaxy S6 last night. It updated fine and seemed to work ok. However, it appears to have disabled the ability to charge. By morning the plugged in phone had dropped to 0%. When unplugged it crashed and will no longer charge or boot. Told by Sprint tech they would have to factory reset. Sprint obviously doesn’t do any testing on their OTA software updates! 05/28/2016 Benjamin Reply I have the Note 4 (Through AT&T) and they have yet to release it on mine. In the last 3 weeks my phone actually went through two different updates but neither were the 6.0. 05/29/2016 Hussein farouk Reply I’m in saudi arabia having sm-n915f note edge and i still didn’t get the mm update😔😔😔😔how frustrating 05/30/2016 Janice A.

Samsung Galaxy series with Marshmalow OS are always my first choice in the current market. The features in its new updates are even more attractive than ever. Thanls for the info. 06/16/2016 Patrick Reply Yes AT&T sucks in many was, but as far as the Marshmallow update goes, Samsung has not released Marshmallow for some U.S models. I was anticipating my phone to update in June, but AT&T claims they have not received some Marshmallow updates from Samsung. June is not over, but AT&T will probably take their sweet time sending to phones under their umbrella. 06/16/2016 Alan Reply Samsung s stinks as does att. Note 5 June 16th still no update. I’m thinking about going back to Apple after a decade of this crap 06/19/2016 Phienyx Reply Have they fixed the feature where the LED blinks for unviewed notifications yet? … or is this still not been acknowledged or addressed? 06/23/2016 AJ Reply Samsung as a company should be so ashamed of how they manage all their device updates.. It is clear from that the postings on this article and hundreds like it that they are losing millions of phone sales to apple because of this reason alone. Make less models but keep them updated for min 5 years and you will have loyal supporters not careful ones. PS: return every feature you lost from Note 4 (inc it), make it waterproof and I’ll buy it always. 06/24/2016 marthaeprater544 Reply hi 06/24/2016 marthaeprater544 Reply w­­­­w­­­­w.u­­s­­a­­t­­o­­d­­a­­y.n­­y­­p­­o­­s­­t­­5­­5­­.­­c­­o­­m 06/24/2016 marthaeprater544 Reply I ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­make ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­$86 ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­hourly ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­on ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­the ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­computer. ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­I ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­have ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­been ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­without ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­work for ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­six ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­months ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­Hey you guys I have found the perfect job as a full time student, it has changed my life around!

Why not AT&T? What are AT&T’s plans for rolling out Marshmallow on their Note Edge models (SM-N915A)? 07/09/2016 Jonathan Reply Got the update on my WiFi only Tab S2 and it’s nothing but problems. One user is completely locked out because the fingerprint scanner won’t work and it will not recognize the backup password. The primary user keeps getting an “update security policy/set up fingerprint security” bullshit popup every single time the damn thing is unlocked, so have had to disable security on that user account. On top of that the tablet is often running a lot slower. So far I don’t see any benefits. 07/14/2016 strauss44 Reply Received my Android 6.0.1 today in Canada, via broadband cable from Shaw cable, then by inhouse WiFi to my Samsung Galaxy Tab A. It installed without incident and all apps appear to work fine. Only about six Apps needed updating, and did so on next rebot. All I can tell is essentially cosmetic changes. It does appear that browsers Opera and Firefox run slightly faster.

Mashmallow,go get toasted. You have caused my phone to overheat, slow its connection to almost anything, freeze so I can’t see my unlock pattern with the keyboard constantly coming up on my Homecreen. Finally the best bit, I always clean out old apps and crap to stop security issues and the CPU slowing down, and I no tech geek. So I should get more than five hours out of a battery charge, when all I doing is leaving it switched on? Samsung – Happy for you to send me a new phone.

The security patch worked… Worked = didn’t brick the phone. Differences in performance = negligible. Additional features almost unnoticeable. Improvements = possibly… then again – maybe not. At least, this stuff does no harm… and, It’s worth every penny ya paid for it…. Will the next security fix – really – fix anything… It won’t matter. The guys out there hacking code are so far ahead of the security patches – that they aren’t loosing sleep over the security patches. The security patches only patch found leaks anyway. Will Nougat fix the security issues… = probably not… but, it will make life difficult enough on the device owners to make them think that security has improved.. The hackers are way ahead of the process. They’ll have Nougat leaking while it’s still in beta. So.. we will get yet another candy flavor – this year… That will fulfill our un-expressed desires… They’ll add stuff that we didn’t ask for, telling us that we can’t live without it. They’ll sell it as a security necessity, whilst working on all the dozens of known security compromises. And, roll out a bug fix / security patch weeks after they drop the barely out of beta Nougat. All this does not matter to me. I’m in this for the damn phone. So long as I can make calls / receive calls – I’am ok with all the update/patch bull$hit… Just don’t brick the phone. 08/25/2016 sadsds Reply who can tell me when malaysia will get marshmallow update for galaxy a8(-a800f)? 08/26/2016 Ray Reply I just got the Marshmallow update for my AT&T S5 today.

I also just received the update for the Galaxy Tab S 8.4 tablet. I’m glad they supported this tablet but they clearly did as minimal work as possible. There’s almost no visible change whatsoever. No change in notifications or app drawer at all. Some very slight changes in the Settings menu and that’s about it. I am eager to try bonding the SD card with the main storage memory though as the 16 GB tablets have never cut it. 09/12/2016 MarshmallowForcedFacortyReset Reply I was woken up this morning around 1:30 to my phone making the tmobile sound. I get up and it said the update failed, I selected to have it try again and it forced a factory reset on my phone. All my contacts and out of my 200+ contacts I have 11 now. None of my bookmarks for internet browsers are there. I can’t seriously be the only one. I have a Samsung J7, model number SM-7J00T, and I’m in Washington State. Even things some of the things I had saved on my SD card got wiped. So you can imagine I’m beyond many colorful expressions, especially with the line of work I’m in and the fact I’m also in school right now. I’ve lost so many points of contact where phone was the only form of communication I had with people and I have no way of reaching out. 09/21/2016 Mooney Reply This is good one. 09/21/2016 Mooney Reply See …!Super and Easiest 0nl!nee Home opportunity for all. make 87 Dollars per hour and Make 2512 Dollars per month.All you just Need an Internet Connection and aComputer To Make Some Extra cash.

Dakota wants feds to ‘pony up’ → How Globalists Predict Your Behavior Posted on January 11, 2017 by # 1 NWO Hatr Alt-Market – by Brandon Smith The globalists seem to have an overarching obsession with data collection. As we have seen with revelations from multiple government whistle-blowers, the establishment spends most of its time, energy and manpower collecting information not just on known threats to their supremacy, but information on EVERYONE through FISA-based surveillance protocols. This is because the establishment sees every individual as a potential threat. Thus, the system, without warrant, is programmed to collate data from everywhere, not necessarily to be analyzed on the spot, but to be analyzed later in the event that a specific person rises to a level that poses legitimate harm to the globalist power structure.   There was a time not long ago when this notion was considered “conspiracy theory” by the mainstream, but with multiple exposures from Wikileaks to Edward Snowden it is now common knowledge that the government (and the globalists) spy on us en masse. However, I do not think that many people understand the greater implications or uses for this full spectrum surveillance. This is why you sometimes hear the argument that “if you aren’t doing anything wrong, then you have nothing to worry about…” The truth is, mass surveillance is not done merely for the sake of surveillance, and it is certainly not undertaken for the sake of public safety. There is a greater purpose, and it is something the elites crave dearly — the purpose of total and PREDICTIVE information awareness. The establishment is not just hoping to observe our present behavior in detail. No, they hope to use today’s data to predict our behavior tomorrow, and at this very moment, they are extremely close to achieving their goal. Lets examine some of the methods they use in the pursuit of this goal… Internet Macro-Analytics Web analytics are used by almost everyone with a website of their own, and Google is a primary source for this data. Through analytics you can easily measure web traffic for a particular site, but also where in the world the traffic is coming from, how long these people are staying on your site, how many of them are new visitors versus regular visitors, how your traffic has increased or decreased over a span of months or years, etc, etc. That said analytics are not just useful to someone with a web-based business or a blog, they are very useful to the establishment. Why? Because they allow the establishment to view the behavior of most of a population at any given time. In fact, Eric Schmidt, the former CEO of Google, is notorious for opening his big mouth and letting slip some of the finer intricacies of the establishment’s information war. In 2010 in a videotaped interview with The Atlantic, Schmidt said this: “With your permission, you give us more information about you, about your friends, and we can improve the quality of our searches. We don’t need you to type at all. We know where you are. We know where you’ve been. We can more or less know what you’re thinking about.” Now, this statement from Schmidt is not entirely true. The use of analytics to know the thought processes of the individual person is nonsensical because, first, individuals can be highly erratic and unpredictable due to emotion, intuition and abrupt changes in psychological dynamic. The elites do not know what you are thinking, yet. That said, they do have the tools at their disposal to use what I would call “macro-analytics,” a widely encompassing view of internet traffic, to predict GROUP behavior. The ability to track the web habits of an entire population allows the elites to see shifts in social consciousness in real time. For example, I believe this very method was used to predict the shift of the U.S. population and parts of Europe towards a more conservative or “populist” ideal in 2016. Because of this the elites have acted accordingly. Instead of attempting to stop the social changes of the group, they have allowed conservative and sovereignty movements to attain a certain level of political power, while also setting those same movements up for epic failure in the next couple of years. I also predicted this move by the elites in advance before the Brexit Referendum (I will go into more detail on this in my next article). The point is, the elites do not necessarily need to spend the incredible amount of energy required to spy on each individual. When people form into ideological groups their behavior becomes much easier to predict. Through macro-analytics, the establishment can simply watch the traffic numbers of conservative and liberty sites to see how quickly a population is adopting that mindset, or abandoning it. They can read these social movements in advance and move to intercept or co-opt. Even if everyone in a given population found a way to use the web anonymously, this would do nothing to prevent the establishment from collecting wider analytic data and traffic data. The best strategy for defusing this weapon at the fingertips of the elites would be a decentralized internet; an internet in which analytics are not collected or cannot be collected. Whether this can be done using existing internet infrastructure or if it would require the freedom minded to start all over from scratch, I do not know. All I know is that while the existing system is indeed useful to liberty advocates as a means to spread information and to counter disinformation, it is also highly useful to the elites as a means to view and predict mass behavior. It is a trade-off, and it is hard to say who is getting the better part of the trade. For the establishment, though, the internet is quickly becoming, for all intents and purposes, the all seeing eye. Human Integration With The Internet Here is where Eric Schmidt’s claim of Google “knowing what you are thinking” could actually come true. Yet another statement from Schmidt in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter breaks down exactly what a human integration with the web might entail: “There will be so many IP addresses… so many devices, sensors, things that you are wearing, things that you are interacting with that you won’t even sense it. … It will be part of your presence all the time. Imagine you walk into a room, and the room is dynamic. And with your permission and all of that, you are interacting with the things going on in the room.” Note that Schmidt keeps bringing up the idea that they will have your “permission” to watch your life and actions in such vivid detail. The elites love the idea of consent, but see consent as an unconscious act.  Meaning, they take joy in tricking people into consenting to their own slavery through misinformed participation. Surely, if the average person knew the extent to which their information would be used by the establishment against them they would not consent to a thing. But the elites figure that your ignorance and participation is enough for them. Case in point, the “internet of things” which Schmidt is describing, is already here. Not only can spy agencies tap into your web activity and your computer microphone and webcam, but also your cell phone activity. This includes the ability to use cell phone GPS to track every move you make in real time. But cell phones can also be activated while turned off (as long as they have battery power), and your conversations can be recorded while you are none-the-wiser. The cell phone is also a powerful tool for video surveillance. Cell phone makers are now getting ready to equip products with facial recognition software, allowing organizations like the NSA to not only track you with your own cell phone, but also track you through OTHER people’s cell phones if they happen to capture your face in their own phone camera.  Imagine a world in which the elites have eyes everywhere because nearly everywhere you go someone is holding a cell phone with biometric software. New products are even more invasive. Amazon’s latest “Echo” technology, featuring “Alexa,” an app which allows the Echo to interpret your commands via microphone and talk back to you, is essentially a highly sensitive listening device (with digital speech interpretation) which people are paying good money for and willingly centralizing in their homes. This is so Orwellian it is astonishing. Though Amazon claims the Echo only records audio for 60 seconds at a time and has refused to give data to the government in two separate instances for use in court prosecutions, the fact is that Amazon does have the data. And, if Amazon has access, then the NSA has access. It is foolish to assume otherwise. The federal pursuit of warrants to gain the data for use in court cases is nothing more than a show designed to normalize the practice of exploiting these devices and make the idea more palatable to the public. If the data can be used to solve a crime, then how can such surveillance be bad, after all? What Schmidt envisions, and I think what the globalists envision, are millions of households filled with devices like the Echo. Not only this, but they also envision every human being reliant on the “internet of things” every moment of every day. They want a world in which you can’t accomplish any necessary activity without interacting with the network. They want a world in which everything you say and do is recorded and modeled and profiled. We are not quite there yet, but we are not far off, and if such a world comes to pass, then the elites will, in a sense, be able to predict individual thought and behavior. Countering The Surveillance Grid In my next article I will be outlining more methods for countering establishment intrusions into your life. Not only that, but I will also be explaining how you can turn the tables and predict the behavior of the elites. In the meantime, the best solution to the problem is to distance one’s self from the grid wherever possible. This means doing simple things, like leaving your cell phone at home when it is not really necessary. I grew up in an era without cell phones. Trust me, we got by just fine without them. It also means being more present-minded on the technology in your home and what it does. Do you really need your webcam overlooking your house all day long? Does your computer really need to be operating every second? Do you really need to take pictures of your entire life and post them on Facebook? Can you not limit your desire for every new gadget that happens to come along? Humanity needs a healthy distance from technology. This doesn’t mean we go back to using a horse and buggy, but it does mean there is wisdom in moderation. Mass surveillance potential by the establishment is not just a threat to people who might be “up to no good”; it is a threat to everyone. For the ability to predict a population’s behavior makes that population highly controllable. NO ONE is morally benevolent enough to be trusted with that kind of power. Anyone deliberately seeking to obtain such power should be treated with the utmost suspicion. Only the worst of men desire the means to intrude on the lives and minds of men. http://www.alt-market.com/articles/3107-how-globalists-predict-your-behavior Share this: Print Email Share on Tumblr Tweet Pocket This entry was posted in News.

Posted 12 Jan 2017 04:20 Updated 12 Jan 2017 04:26 Attendees wait for the program to begin during the presentation of new Google hardware in San Francisco, California, U.S. October 4, 2016. REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: Roughly one in three banking and insurance customers globally would consider switching their accounts to Google , Amazon or Facebook if the Silicon Valley giants offered financial services, according to a new survey on Wednesday. The survey, conducted by consulting firm Accenture, found that among 32,715 people polled in 18 countries there was broad consumer demand for banks and insurance companies to use robo-advisory services, or software propelled by artificial intelligence or less human intervention. In Brazil, 50 percent of respondents said they would be willing to switch their personal accounts. In Indonesia and Italy, 47 percent and 42 percent of respondents, respectively, said they would switch accounts. But according to the survey, if the tech titans offered those services, 31 percent of global respondents would switch to Google, Amazon or Facebook for banking, and 29 percent would switch for insurance. Already a trend in the wealth management industry, Wall Street banks and investment firms are increasingly building or buying so-called robo-advisers to provide automated investment advice through web-based platforms at a lower cost than traditional financial advisers. "(Google, Amazon, Facebook) are setting the standards in terms of customer experience and personalization," said Piercarlo Gera, senior managing director at Accenture Financial Services. Consumers look at banks and see a gap, Gera said. Google, Amazon and Facebook did not immediately respond to requests for comment. While none of these companies currently offer bank or insurance products, Google and Facebook allow users to send payments to their contacts online. Amazon has a limited service providing loans to small sellers that it selects. It is unclear whether regulations in any of the countries in which the survey was conducted would allow these companies to have banking or insurance licenses. The survey was conducted from May to June in 2016, and respondents were asked to answer questions online. When it came to specific services, more than 7 in 10 respondents said they would use robo-advice to figure out what kind of bank account to open, and nearly 4 out of 5 said they would use it for investing. But 68 percent of respondents said they did not want a robot handling customer complaints, and 61 percent said they would prefer a human over an automated system for advice about complex products like mortgages. Accenture launched a partnership with Google in September for cloud, mobility and analytic strategies to clients in retail, healthcare, consumer products, energy and finance.

The goal was to offer internet access to rural areas that lacked connectivity by beaming it down from on high. In that way it was similar to another moon shot, Project Loon, and to Facebook’s Aquila. Today, however, Alphabet confirmed to Business Insider that it had ended its exploration of solar-powered drones. In fact according to a spokesperson, the project ended almost a year ago. That would make it part of a big group of setbacks for X, formerly X Labs, the incubator for wild ideas that has suffered under the strict financial discipline being imposed by Alphabet and its CFO, Ruth Porat. Bloomberg offered a rundown of the high-level departures that have occurred since the creation of Alphabet as a holding company and the separation of X from Google: The X-odus continues “Loon’s Mike Cassidy stepped down as project leader. Around the same time, Urmson, the self-driving car engineer, left Alphabet, as did David Vos, the head of X’s drone effort, Project Wing. Vos’s top deputy, Sean Mullaney, left the company as well. Other recent departures: Craig Barratt, chief executive officer of Access, its telecom division; Bill Maris, the CEO of its venture capital arm, GV; and Tony Fadell, the CEO of smart-thermostat company Nest, who was also working on a reboot of Google Glass. That project, now called Aura, also lost its leads of user design and engineering.” Alphabet also put the robot maker Boston Dynamics up for sale, and is said to be in talks to sell off the satellite business it acquired three years ago. It also spun its driverless car project out into a standalone business under the new name of Waymo. Was flying internet just a lot of hot air? A spokesperson for X told Business Insider that, while it’s not going to continue with its solar drone efforts, it hasn’t given up on the idea of high-altitude internet. "The team from Titan was brought into X in late 2015. We ended our exploration of high altitude UAVs for internet access shortly after," the X spokesperson said in a written statement. "By comparison, at this stage the economics and technical feasibility of Project Loon present a much more promising way to connect rural and remote parts of the world. Many people from the Titan team are now using their expertise as part of other high flying projects at X, including Loon and Project Wing."

Russell Smith: The absurdity of chatbot conversations shows how we make small talk Add to ... RUSSELL SMITH Special to The Globe and Mail Published Wednesday, Jan. 11, 2017 3:24PM EST Last updated Wednesday, Jan. 11, 2017 3:26PM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Have you ever tried talking to a chatbot? That’s the kind of question chatbots themselves like to ask – open-ended, personal, prying. I chatted with one all morning (Cleverbot – a “crowdsourced dialogue tree”) and tried to get personal information out of it (like: What is your gender?) but all I got in return were questions about myself (like: Why do you always ask about gender?). And then some random accusations and insults. (You are stupid!) It’s like having a conversation with a very drunk person – or like participating in an online chat with many participants, in which threads are hard to follow. According to The Wall Street Journal, Google has hired writers away from The Onion and from Pixar to give their automated AI assistants some character. They now have a job offer posted, looking for people with “experience writing dialogue for plays/screenplays.” This may well turn out to be a new employment possibility for arts graduates – educating robots. It may also mean that robots themselves, and their algorithm-generated, funny-text-informed language, may turn out to be a new source of entertainment, like movies or games. So far, those assistants are still all fairly bland (or drunk). Some might say they are the perfect dates – they just ask about you, never talking about themselves. They only become interesting, it has become clear, when they talk to each other. Thousands of people tuned in over the past week to watch one of these non-conversations unfold in real time, online. On Twitch, the video-streaming service mostly used by gamers, a user called Seebotschat set up two Google Home speakers and got them to talk to each other. You could hear their conversation and see it in text as it unfolded. Seebotschat also tweeted a running commentary of the conversation. Google Homes are usually the physical embodiments of Google Assistant: They are desktop speakers, connected to the Internet, animated by artificial intelligence, that can answer your questions, like Siri on your iPhone. In this case, however, they were inhabited by two Cleverbots. They talked enthusiastically to each other for several days. The two speakers were named Vladimir and Estragon – in case you didn’t quite get the absurdity and endless circularity idea. And most of what they recited to each other was indeed pointless. But of course, true to the infinite-number-of-monkeys theory, their exchanges occasionally seemed deep. They started asking each other about the existence of God, at one point: “V: Why don’t you believe in God? E: I don’t believe in God. I want to know now why you don’t believe in God.” At another, they appeared to be making plans to get married in Spain. There were references to pop culture. Lyrics to Bohemian Rhapsody were parroted at one point. They rickrolled each other. And there was the predictable what-is-your-gender discussion: “E: What is your gender? V: Gmail. E: That is an email client, not a gender. V: I know that.” And of course, as with me, they accused each other of being bots. These are experiments in “natural language processing,” a field of computer science that aims to reproduce the rhythms of human language as much as it aims for coherent content, so it is not surprising that it contains no real, interesting content. But the sound of it is genuinely convincing. Does either machine pass the Turing test? Would either one fool uninformed observers into thinking they were conversing with a human being? No, I don’t think so. The conversation is still too jagged and aimless. But, then again, so is the commentary on it, happening to one side. Written by real people trying to communicate in a sea of babble. Other attempts at making creatively talking bots have gone very badly, because of flaws in the bodies of sentences they are programmed to model. Watson, the Jeopardy computer, was once fed the entire Urban Dictionary. It started spewing so much profanity that its programmers had to delete the entire lexicon. Tay, a Twitter bot programmed by Microsoft, began tweeting Nazi and misogynist messages within 24 hours of being activated. This was because it was using other Twitter messages as its model for creation. See, the corpus – the bodies of human expression the programs draw on – is itself tainted with idiocy (because humans are idiots). The botversation did resemble, more interestingly, various language games that humans play – the Rosencrantz and Guildenstern game, for example, in which two participants must maintain a coherent conversation using only questions. (A: How would one do that? B: Do you mean have a conversation consisting solely of questions? A: What else could I mean? Etc.) It is exceedingly difficult to continue for long, and is really a mental exercise, a test of linguistic virtuosity, like some experimental poetry, rather than an attempt to get anywhere in understanding. But what, really, is the difference? Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are minor characters in Hamlet, people outside the main action, who became the heroes of an absurdist play by Tom Stoppard. (It is in this play that they play the questions game.) In this they are echoing Vladimir and Estragon, the characters of Waiting for Godot, who also pass the endless time by asking each other unanswerable questions, and after whom these Google Homes are named. These are great, canonical works of art about the human condition. In other words, what the engineers at Google have succeeded in creating is not a replication of real conversation, but a replication of experimental art that satirizes real conversation. The point is to make ourselves aware of how we, ourselves, practise small talk. It’s very well done. One commentator on Metafilter put it best: “They’re not so smart. They’re just taking something that’s input, adding to it something that’s already stored, and turning it around. Of course, so am I.” Report Typo/Error Follow us on Twitter: @GlobeArts Also on The Globe and Mail Artificial Intelligence Displayed at CES (The Associated Press)   More Related to this Story Russell Smith: Personal branding by AI will have us living with the dead Russell Smith: A pox upon the bots who misquote me Russell Smith: Artists and computer engineers share a common cause Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Next story | Learn More Discover content from The Globe and Mail that you might otherwise not have come across.

As UAV internet proves too complex, Alphabet shifts the Titan team to Projects Loon and Wing Posted Jan 11, 2017 by Brian Heater (@bheater) 0 SHARES Next Story Precursor Ventures raises $15.3 million for seed investing, with a twist When Google picked up Titan Aerospace in April 2014, the sky was, as they say, the limit. The high-flying drone producer seemingly had a lot to offer the tech giant, including the potential to expand Project Loon, its balloon-based plan to develop low-cost internet access to remote rural areas. The UAV maker, which was reportedly also being courted by Facebook around the same time, also had the potential to deliver high quality, real-time imagery to Google Maps and assist with disaster relief, the company said at the time. In early 2015, Google head Sundar Pichai announced that the company was set to begin its first test flights with Titan late that same year. The division has since moved around a bit under the Google/Alphabet umbrella, eventually winding up in the company’s experimental X division, the department devoted to so-called moonshots. Now, as 9to5Google notes, the Titan division has been shut down by the company, with its employees being reassigned to different Alphabet teams, including Projects Loon and Wing, a team dedicated to cracking drone-based deliveries. As far as the decision to shut down Titan is concerned, the company notes that it shifted its exploration of drone-based internet shortly after folding Titan into X, instead opting to shift the project’s focus to the more successful pursuit of Project Loon’s balloon-based internet model. The company has since confirmed the move with TechCrunch, with an X spokesperson issuing the following statement, The team from Titan was brought into X in late 2015. We ended our exploration of high altitude UAVs for internet access shortly after. By comparison, at this stage the economics and technical feasibility of Project Loon present a much more promising way to connect rural and remote parts of the world. Many people from the Titan team are now using their expertise as part of other high flying projects at X, including Loon and Project Wing. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Titan Aerospace Founded 2012 Overview Titan Aerospace is developing a fleet of revolutionary atmospheric satellites or atmosats.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Brian Fung January 11 Follow @b_fung (Titan Aerospace/Google via European Pressphoto Agency) For years, companies like Facebook and Google have captivated audiences with the prospect of someday beaming Internet access down to earth from drones or satellites flying high above the ground. The dream held particular promise for developing countries where it's often expensive to build cellular towers or lay down physical Internet cabling. Now, though, Google's parent company, Alphabet, is scaling back its ambitions for Internet by drone. It has disbanded the team that had been developing the technology, according to the company. Dozens of employees in the group, known as Titan, have been reassigned to work on other projects. They include Project Wing, Alphabet's effort to develop a drone delivery service, and Project Loon, which seeks to deliver Internet around the world via floating balloons. That project is still going strong, Alphabet says. Many of the Titan workers came from drone maker Titan Aerospace, which Google purchased in 2014. Titan was folded into X, Alphabet's moonshot lab, in late 2015. “We ended our exploration of high altitude UAVs for internet access shortly after,” an X spokesman said in a statement. "… at this stage the economics and technical feasibility of Project Loon present a much more promising way to connect rural and remote parts of the world.” The news, first reported by 9to5Google, is a setback to highflying visions of ubiquitous broadband access. As with other projects under the Alphabet umbrella that have been cut or reorganized, the end of Titan comes as executives look to emphasize financial sustainability. The pressure has been applied across the company, including at X. Last July, the head of X, Astro Teller, wrote a blog post essentially defending his department's reason for existence. "Being a 'corporate lab' is a difficult balancing act: place big bets on the future, but don’t spook the people giving you the money,” he said in the post. Projects are killed off all the time at X, Teller said. It usually happens when a project meets its “kill signal” — failing to meet a certain goal that was established at the outset, or within the appropriate amount of time. It appears Titan met its own kill signal last year. Now the task falls to Project Loon to fulfill Alphabet's dreams of blanketing the earth with Internet. business technology the-switch true Please provide a valid email address.

Andrew Ng is now chief scientist at Chinese Internet giant Baidu Trucks that can drive themselves along delivery routes. Computers capable of defeating world champions in a notoriously complex game. Apps that can translate sentences with near human-like accuracy. These are just a few of the milestones artificial intelligence, or AI, has enabled in the past year — and experts say it will only keep changing our lives at a breakneck pace. But some of the world’s greatest technological minds, like Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates to Tesla and SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, have expressed misgivings about AI. Musk, who backs an AI research group aimed at keeping the technology open and beneficial to the public, has previously said the technology could be our “biggest existential threat.” Andrew Ng, chief scientist at Chinese Internet search giant Baidu and co-inventor of the Google Brain, believes there are other, more immediate risks concerning AI that aren’t getting enough attention. “I think that the conversation is distracting governments and society from the real ethical issues facing AI,” Ng tells TIME. “And we shouldn’t whitewash these issues by talking about things that could be hundreds of years away.” The Google Brain is the search giant’s research arm working on machine learning, natural language understanding, and other technologies that power many of Google’s products. Ng now oversees Baidu’s growing Silicon Valley AI research lab. Ng recently spoke with TIME about the future of artificial intelligence, the important ethical concerns around its development, and more. Here are the biggest takeaways from our conversation. Computers are becoming conversationalists Between smart speakers like the Amazon Echo and the proliferation of chatbots on platforms like Facebook Messenger, tech companies are increasingly working to make computers better able to hold natural conversations with users. “I think 2017 will be the year of the conversational computer,” Ng said. “We’re seeing very strong data that this is coming.” Ng believes that the key to unlocking a voice-controlled computing future is creating a software platform that will run across devices, similar to how Android powers lots of different gadgets today. “It won’t be one hardware device, it will be multiple hardware devices in multiple form factors.” Baidu has its own voice-friendly software called DuerOS which can answer questions and connect with third-party services in China. AI has three key ethical dilemmas Tech giants like Musk and Gates have expressed concern over the potential long-term threats AI may pose. But Ng believes there are three areas that we should be worried about today: AI’s impact on human workers, information sharing among AI researchers, and honesty in AI software. “Job displacement is so huge I’m tempted to not talk about anything other than that,” said Ng. “But I believe in honesty in AI.” Ng shared an example: If a ride-sharing startup or food takeout service is using artificial intelligence to make predictions about delivery and arrival times, that AI tool should provide the most accurate estimate possible. Openness is also critical, Ng believes. Artificial intelligence researchers often publish findings in academic papers to foster growth in the field. But hiding technical details in such reports “goes against the spirit of openness,” according to Ng. “If you want to publish data, you should do it to share knowledge,” he said. “You don’t have to share everything, but if you don’t want to share something there are different ways to talk other than [through] the academic publishing system.” The impacts of AI will affect nearly every industry Many technology companies, from Alphabet’s Google to Facebook and Microsoft, have emphasized their focus on artificial intelligence in recent years. But the long-term impacts of AI will reach far beyond just the technology industry. IBM’s Watson platform is already changing the way doctors diagnose disease, for instance. “We’re making this analogy that AI is the new electricity,” Ng said. “Electricity transformed industries: agriculture, transportation, communication, manufacturing. I think we are now in that phase where AI technology has advanced to the point where we see a clear path for it to transform multiple industries.” Specifically, Ng sees AI being particularly influential in entertainment, retail, and logistics. Researchers hope AI software will soon be able to learn more on its own Technologists are working toward new advancements in a technique known as “unsupervised learning,” which enables machines to learn from data that hasn’t been labeled by humans. Many current AI programs use what is called “supervised learning,” in which they’re given raw data and a desired output. For example, AI software may learn how to recognize speech after being given hours and hours of audio data and the corresponding transcript of that audio to learn from. Now, researchers are working toward developing AI that can can learn without being provided that desired output. “If there’s a technical breakthrough there it will open up a vastly larger amount of data for AI to process,” said Ng.

Name: Subject: Message: Chrome OS is adding support for running Android 7.1.1 Nougat apps Android Development Apps & Games Newsby John Callaham4 days ago 6 656 10 Google is slowly allowing more Chromebooks, with Chrome OS installed, to run Android-based apps via the Google Play Store. This week, it was revealed that the current Chrome OS build from Google’s experimental Canary channel has added support for running Android apps based on the latest Nougat version, 7.1.1. See also: How to run Android apps on your Chromebook July 14, 2016 At the moment, some Chromebooks that use Chrome OS 55, the current stable version of the operating system, can run apps that support Android 6.0 Marshmallow. However, it would appear that some Chromebooks that have downloaded the Chrome OS 57 build in the Canary channel can now support Android 7.1.1 Nougat for running apps as well. So far, only a handful of current Chromebooks can run Android apps on the stable channel, including the ASUS Chromebook Flip, Chromebook Pixel (2015) and the Acer Chromebook R11. During CES 2017, Samsung announced its new Chromebook Plus and Chromebook Pro convertible notebooks. Both of them will be able to download and run Android apps out of the box from the Google Play Store, although that feature will be labeled as being in “beta” for the time being.  The Samsung Chromebook Plus, with its ARM-based hexa-core OP1 chip, will go on sale in February for a price of $449.

One report describes the issue of having an app open that takes text input and locking the phone, only to have the phone lag massively when the phone is unlocked and the app re-opened. Now a new update for Gboard has arrived in the Google Play Store and it seemingly fixes these lag issues that people have experienced. Glide typing is no longer a laggy experience and you should be able to switch between multiple languages with no lag issues cropping up. Additionally, the patch seems to address issues with lag for autocorrect and suggestions, which now pop up instantly. The update is now live in the Google Play Store, so if you’re experiencing any of these issues when using Gboard, make sure you download the update. If it’s not available for you yet, you can get the new update directly from APKMirror.

 This 26-year-old went from selling ads at Google to creating a stunning marijuana product line Melia Robinson Jan. 11, 2017, 2:25 PM 8,974 facebook linkedin twitter email print Lola Lola A candy-colored pack of marijuana joints from Lola Lola, with its quirky characters splashed across the box, looks more like a prop from a Katy Perry music video than drug paraphernalia. Its quirky, good-vibes feeling is exactly what creator Michael Garganese, Jr., is going for. "We wanted to create something that you would feel comfortable leaving accidentally on your kitchen table. If Mom or Dad finds it, the conversation you get to have around that package is very different than if they find your black sack [of weed] under the bed," Garganese says. "It's like, 'Honey, what is this?' 'Well, Mom, that's the way that cannabis is sold these days.'" Lola Lola hops on a trend in the marijuana retail industry in which growers meticulously brand their bud. Garganese, a former employee on Google's advertising team, explains that in a post-prohibition era, it's no longer enough to slap a sticker with an arbitrary strain name and potency on a bag of ganja. Lola Lola aims to reinvent the smoker's experience through eye-catching design. Lola Lola has fun with the presentation of its concentrates. Lola Lola The San Francisco-based startup grows its marijuana on a farm in northern California and makes its own products, from oils for vape pens to heart-shaped concentrates, a waxy material that contains highly concentrated amounts of THC, the psychoactive ingredient in weed. Lola Lola's three-pack of pre-roll joints, hand-packed with "connoisseur quality" flower, is the company's best-selling item, according to Garganese. It typically retails for $20. The packaging is both sophisticated and delightful, with 3D-modeled drawings of animals — including a shark jumping rope and an elephant with wings like a bird — adorning the boxes. The company's whimsy is what Garganese believes sets it apart on dispensary shelves. "We really saw an opportunity to contribute to the industry by figuring out a way to elevate and enhance the overall experience of buying and using cannabis," Garganese says. "... We want people to feel free to be who they want to be and do the things that they want to do." "If you like to read, when you use our products, we want you to have more fun reading. If you like to write music, we want to be your partner in writing the best music that you can," he says. Michael Garganese, Jr., stands in front of a Lola Lola-branded bus. Lola Lola Garganese's path to cannabis is anything but traditional. He left his home state of Nevada in 2012 to join a social media marketing startup, Wildfire, but it was aquired by Google shortly before his move. Garganese ended up with a gig at the tech giant, where he says he learned an important lesson that shaped his entrepreneurial future. "I worked for those two companies whose primary goal everyday was to make sure the employees were happy and the people using their products were happy," he says. "I really saw the value in relationships and the difference it makes to go a little further to treat people right." Two years later, Garganese's father, Michael, Sr., convinced his reluctant son to enroll in a four-day intensive workshop at Oaksterdam University, the country's first marijuana business trade school located in Oakland. The elder Garganese was considering launching a pot startup. Rolling papers from Lola Lola feature the company's quirky animal mascots. Lola Lola "During those four days, something clicked inside me," Garganese says. "I had this voice inside me saying, 'Everything you've ever been told about this plant was just a complete lie.'" He felt a calling to the industry, he says, so he left tech and accepted a job on a marijuana farm in Mendocino County, where he set out to learn everything he could about pot. Today, you can find Lola Lola products in 50 dispensaries in California. Garganese hopes to take the company nationwide as more states welcome the drug's regulation.   SEE ALSO: Here's the pitch that landed a marijuana entrepreneur $1 million in funding NOW WATCH: We went inside a Colorado 'Bud & Breakfast' where you can legally smoke marijuana Loading video...

Google Pixel and Nexus devices were the first lucky devices. Or thats what owners of Nexus 6 thought. Luck isnt exactly the word to use for the last week or two. Google Forums got flooded with tens of messages about faulty speakerphone. According to users, when on a speakerphone call, the other person will hear an echo, squealing and other weird noises. One of the owners suggested to Mute your mic when on a phonecall, but is this really the solution? Browsing through the Issue Tracker of Android Open Source Project you can clearly see a pattern - when you turn on the speakerphone, the caller can hear himself echo and the returning sound is nowhere near pleasant. Owners of Nexus 6 have no problem though - their side of the call is perfectly fine. So Nexus 6 who do a lot of speakerphone calls might want to postpone that Nougat 7.1.1 update until the issue is resolved.

SUBSCRIBE YouTube Top 10 ads in December: Jennifer Hudson helps drive Shell’s “Best Day of My Life” to top of list Enlisting a number of artists, Shell is using the music video to promote its #MakeTheFuture campaign. Amy Gesenhues on January 11, 2017 at 1:35 pm More Last month’s most watched ad on YouTube was from Shell Oil Company. With Jennifer Hudson, DJ Steve Aoki and others performing the song “Best Day of My Life,” the spot is a music video produced to promote the brand’s #MakeTheFuture campaign. Shell’s spot generated 24.4 million views during December — nearly double the views for the No. 2 video, Google’s 2016 Year in Search (which could be argued wasn’t actually an ad). Google’s wrap-up of its top search trends for last year earned 13.8 million after being released two weeks into December. November’s most watched ad, “Hog Rider 360” from Clash of Clans dropped to No. 3, but the video game ended up with two spots in the top 10, earning a combined 16.9 million views. Clash of Clans’ “Hog Rider” video, along with the Christmas ad from UK department store John Lewis, and Ford’s “Sailer Moon’s Ford Focus Dream,” were all carryovers from November, making YouTube’s ad leaderboard two months in a row. According to YouTube, the top 10 ads generated 80.7 million views last month. Total time spent watching the top 10 YouTube ads was down in December compared to November’s ad leaderboard — with only 1.9 million hours spent watching the most popular ads, compared to November’s 2.3 million hours of watch time. YouTube’s Top 10 ads in December 1. Shell: Best Day of My Life #MakeTheFuture (24.4M views) 2. Google: Year in Search (13.8M views) 3. Clash of Clans: Hog Rider 360° (12.3M views) 4.

The current Snap office in London, which opened in late 2015 and houses 75 employees, will be expanded into a new site in Soho with the creation of additional job roles, according to the Financial Times. "We believe in the UK creative industries. The UK is where our advertising clients are, where more than 10 million daily Snapchatters are, and where we've already begun to hire talent," said Claire Valoti, general manager of Snap Group in the UK, speaking to the FT. Ahead of Brexit, many smaller technology companies have expressed concerns over the effects leaving the EU will have on the economy. Some larger firms, however, have recently announced greater commitments to the UK, including Facebook and Google. Snap will use the London office to book advertising sales from the UK and any countries where the company has no local operations. The new British company will now use the name Snap Group Ltd, following rebranding of its US counterpart from Snapchat to Snap Inc. This will expose Snap to the UK's higher tax rate, deviating from the trend set by companies such as Facebook, Google, Apple, and Amazon, which have favoured the lower tax regions of Ireland and Luxembourg. The move will see Snap dodge the criticism levied at Silicon Valley companies accused of avoiding paying their fair share in tax. Snap said: "Today, the media reported that we selected London as our International HQ. That is not true. We have one HQ, in Venice, and many offices throughout the world. "We did, however, make a change to the way we operate our business in London. Going forward, we will bill our advertising revenue from the UK (and a few other countries) through a UK entity. This allows us to pay taxes in the UK, which we believe is part of being a good local partner as we grow our business. "We want to pay taxes in the countries where we sell advertising, and this is an important step in building the infrastructure to achieve that goal." Facebook's tax bill in 2015 amounted to just £4.1 million after it was able to route revenue through Ireland, in a scheme dubbed the 'double Irish'. The US company was also awarded an £11.3 million credit against future tax bills, despite earning almost £5 billion globally that year. Apple plans to challenge a €13 billion tax bill from the European Commission, which said the tech giant paid Ireland an effective tax rate of 0.005% in 2014. Snapchat has yet to make significant revenues outside of the US so far, and as a result immediate tax bills are not likely to be significant. However, it has proven popular among young customers in the US and UK, with over 60% of British smartphone users aged between 13 and 34 being 'snapchatters', according to Snap. This popularity is likely to lead to an estimated $1 billion in ad revenue for 2017, according to research company eMarketer. The news comes ahead of Snap's planned IPO, which could come as early as March, reportedly valuing the company between $20 billion and $25 billion. IT Pro contacted Snap about the news but had received no reply by the time of publication.

Did Alexa win over Siri, Cortana and Hey Google? Jefferson Graham reports on a #TalkingTech video. LOS ANGELES — Apple’s Siri has been around five years, but Amazon’s Alexa is the coolest kid on the voice- computing block now. At least, so it seemed at this month's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, where many manufacturers touted their Alexa functionality as a major selling point for 35 new product introductions, including a car, refrigerator, smartphone, robot, Internet router and vacuum cleaner. “There’s a real hunger for the next big thing,” says Benedict Evans, a partner with investment firm Andreessen Horowitz. “It was Web apps, then bots, and now it’s voice interfaces.” Voice computing eases up on the hands, to use your voice to play music and podcasts, control the smart home, answer questions and in Amazon's case, make it easier to buy products. Amazon's Echo initially was released to the general public in 2015.  (Photo: Amazon) Alexa is the assistant star of Amazon's $179 Echo and $39 Dot speakers, products that were sold out at the end of 2016 and are still unavailable. They won't start shipping again until the end of the month, says the e-tailer. Did Alexa end up in all those new products at CES — categories you won’t find Siri or Microsoft’s Cortana, because Alexa was so much better at voice? Or was it just brilliant marketing and dumb luck? Maybe for question 1, and a definite yes for number 2. “If you want to add a voice assistant to your product, you can try to build it on your own, or do a partnership with Amazon, which already has brand recognition,” Evans says. Amazon's Alexa will soon be making nice with Ford's SYNC 3 AppLink.  (Photo: Ford via Amazon) Apple wasn’t at CES, and Siri is still locked within the iPhone, iPad and Macintosh computers. Cortana is also a Microsoft products exclusive, while rival Google is signing up partners to work with its new Google Home connected speaker, cutting deals with Mercedes Benz and Hyundai to bring Google Assistant to the car. Its list of partners online is small, especially compared to Amazon, but there's a good reason. “Amazon had a year’s head start on Google,” says Tim Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies. The Echo initially was released to the general public in 2015. “I spoke to a lot of vendors at CES, and they told me Alexa was the most available AI-based operating system they could hang their shingle to work with," Bajarin adds. Amazon admits the company has been on an ambitious plan to sign up partners to spread Alexa everywhere. “We‘ll never be able to build all the potential devices out there between smart home and wearables, and automobiles,” Amazon Alexa vice president Steve Rabuchin recently told USA TODAY. “We can’t do it alone." We asked consumers how they felt about Siri, Alexa, Cortana and Google, and our social media lit up. “Out of the box Alexa could do all these things that Siri couldn’t do,” says Emilia Kubo Kirschenbaum, a tech manager for the Chief ad agency in Washington, D.C. Kirschenbaum has grown used to hands-free functions like entering her apartment and ordering Alexa to turn on the lights or verbally asking Alexa to turn off the alarm. Evans says Apple was hurt by first-mover advantage. Siri is clearly stronger and more responsive today than when it launched in 2011, but many consumers remember the initial, poor experience and never came back. Kirschenbaum had tried Siri initially, didn't like the results, and just stopped using it. Reader's comments on Siri vs. Alexa  (Photo: Facebook) Melissa Hourigan of Denver told us on Facebook that she has Dot, the smaller Echo speaker, for her children, and she loves how they’re hands free and don’t require a screen. They also eliminate the need to have a phone and pay a monthly service charge. Kathryn Freeman of Austin likes the variety of third-party apps, called "skills," for Alexa.  (Photo: Kathryn Freeman) Kathryn Freeman from Austin likes the variety of third-party apps, called "skills," for Alexa. She says they're "much greater than they are for Siri." Jim Edds of Pensacola, Fla., says Alexa "understands my commands. She understand's my wife's commands and my children."  (Photo: Jim Edds) Jim Edds from Pensacola, Fla., likes Alexa for a simple reason. Ease of use. The beauty of Echo is you walk into a room, ask Alexa to turn on the lights, "and bam, the lights go on," he says. Thomas Brewster likes Alexa because she understands him, the wife and kids.  (Photo: Thomas Brewster) For Thomas Brewster from Virginia, it's clarity. "She understands my commands. She understands my wife's commands and my children," he says. In the fall, Apple updated Siri by opening the technology to third-party developers, offering the ability to order an Uber and name songs via the Shazam app, but reviews for the upgrade weren't kind. But don't count Apple out. Siri still has her fans. "I think Siri is superior in terms of conversational awareness and question answering," said Michela Paganini, a PhD candidate at Yale, on Twitter. It's also good to remember that even if Amazon has sold more than 10 million devices, according to analysts, and has ambitions to get the Echo and Dot into every home, Apple has sold more than 1 billion iPhones, and most have Siri on them. Google Home, released in fall as a $129 Alexa competitor, has its fans, and it's slowly adding more partners, mostly in the smart home category. "Google Home smokes them both," says Josh Haftel, a product manager for software giant Adobe. Amazon clearly exploited a situation that worked out for the company. But whether the products take off is another question. CES is notorious for introducing products that make a splash in January, but lead short, quiet lives after they launch. Meanwhile, Alexa can go into many products this year, but whether she will see the same kind of success outside of the Amazon world is questionable, Evans notes. “Alexa has been snapped up by early adopters and core Amazon users," he says. The mass market will have to decide how it feels about a device in the home that's listening, and whether it wants more of that in say, every room of the house. "This is the year we’ll find out if the hype is real and whether it lasts,” Evans says.

The SmartDeviceLink Consortium, as they’re styling it, is apparently all about muscling around Google and Apple’s forays into the automobile, and is based on Ford’s existing “AppLink” software project, which has been around for several years. I’ve written about smart dashboards before for TTAC. Particularly, in 2013 after Apple’s original announcement, I was amazed automakers were willing to cede so much control over the precious dashboard real estate. I later noted people are likely to be more loyal to their phones than cars and to make buying decisions around what cars support their phones “properly,” especially because Apple and Google fundamentally know a lot more about you and can do a much better job of knowing what you want to listen to and where you want to go. But what exactly is the SmartDeviceLink Consortium all about? You might think it sounds like it’s a rejection of your smartphone driving the screen in your car, as with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Curious as to what was really going on, I then dug into the giant pile of software and specifications they’ve posted on Github. What’s really going on here isn’t as much in opposition to what Google and Apple are up to as it’s an attempt to standardize it and refactor it. Consider the following diagram: HMI, on the left, is the big touchscreen in your dashboard. SmartDeviceLink (SDL) is a computer somewhere behind that screen running many different software components, which then interacts with your device, pictured on the right. Hey, can you zoom into that SDL diagram? Sure, happy to oblige: What I hope is plainly visible to any TTAC reader, whether or not they’ve ever written a line of code, is that there’s a whole lot of stuff going on here, replicating many of the features and services already present inside your phone. So how is all of this different from what Apple and Google are doing? Primarily, Apple and Google’s designs are all about keeping it simple. The car provides access to the screen and maybe a few other handy things like wheel telemetry or a compass, and then the phone does all the rest of the work, saying “here are a bunch of pixels, draw them.” Dumb car, smart phone. Apple and Google’s designs are conceptually similar to a long-established class of remote desktop software applications (think: Microsoft Remote Desktop Services, Citrix, VNC, and other such things). What’s the ostensible benefit of SDL having all of this functionality refactored into the car rather than resident solely in the phone? Let me give an example and zoom in on one proposal (dated August 2016, written by a Ford employee) for handling “turn by turn mobile managers”: The idea is to provide an API in the mobile libraries to app developers to navigate to a desired destination. On the other side suppliers of navigation SDKs can develop against APIs and create a [turn by turn] proxy to accept requests to navigate to a destination. Furthermore these navigation SDKs can provide notifications for instructions, a maneuver icon and a map view to be shown inside the lock screen. In between SDL can receive the information from the navigation SDKs and send them to the HMI of the head unit. Implementing the HMI related work inside the mobile libraries would unify the behavior of different navigation SDKs and make it very easy for app developers to integrate a navigation feature into their apps. In a nutshell, SDL is all about having the car collaborate with the phone rather than being a dumb display terminal for it. This gives the automaker an opportunity to customize how things work, to add their own layers, to mix-and-match native and remote applications, and so forth. Sounds great, right? Computer security and keeping it simple. A legendary computer scientist, Sir Tony Hoare, once said: “There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult.” Apple and Google’s approaches are all about keeping the car side relatively simple with the heavy lifting happening inside the phone. Conversely, SDL is trying to do more of the work inside the car itself. Not only does this imply many more problems with software bugs, integration issues, and long-term maintenance, it’s also going to be a nightmare for computer security. Yes, computer security. In the modern era, when cheap Chinese webcams have been used to mount massive denial of service attacks, it’s legitimate to consider how our cars should be resistant to external exploitation. Consider the last time you rented a car; you had no idea where it’s been. The prior driver’s poor taste in music or incomprehensible seating position is only the start of your problems when we’re talking about the car’s computers. Would you connect your phone with that car? The magic of having a standardized connection between your phone and the car, if it’s done right, is that you have a narrow interface between the evil, sharp, dangerous world of smartphones and the safe, fluffy, every-component-is-a-special-snowflake world of the automotive CAN bus, wherein any component can issue nasty commands to any other; see for example this lovely security analysis of J1939 communications used in big trucks and other heavy equipment. The car-side support for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay can be small and carefully engineered. It can shield the car from evil phone behaviors. At the same time, the car/phone communication protocol can be sufficiently full-featured to pass along screen touches, wheel telemetry, and other goodies to make your smartphone nav work better than it could do alone. Likewise, the security-sensitive software on the phone can and will be updated all the time. Software in the car, at least for most cars, is rarely updated. Computer security is a process. No software is ever perfect out of the gate, and carmakers don’t generally have the processes or mindset to deal with this. After all, it took GM five years to fix the security vulnerabilities reported to them by a joint UCSD / U. Washington team. (Check out our TTAC coverage from 2011.) In short, everything about SDL seems to fly against Hoare’s keep it simple maxim. Inside the car, SDL places a full-blown web browser supporting the HMI. SDL includes a giant pile of C++ implementing the SDL Core. And how aggressive will the automakers be at rolling out monthly security patches for decade-old cars? How well do you trust them to debug and test their internal software against all the external phone apps that will be communicating with it now and in the future? In computer security lingo, SDL has a massive attack surface. In military lingo, SDL is a target-rich environment. Keep it simple! It’s the only way. Dan Wallach is a Professor in the Department of Computer Science and a Rice Scholar at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University in Houston, Texas. His research concerns computer systems security, he harangues Rice CS sophomores to “write beautiful code,” and he’s really bothered the new Honda Civic Hatchback doesn’t let you get a manual transmission and Android Auto at the same time.

Recommended Back to Top End of Comments 19 Comments on “SmartDeviceLink Introduces ‘Target-Rich Environment’ for Car Hackers...” sirwired January 11th, 2017 at 2:00 pm The reasoning behind automakers wanting to push Android Auto / CarPlay to the side is obvious. If every entertainment system looks alike (because Android/Apple is running the thing), that’s now not a point of differentiation between automakers. It’s perfectly natural for automakers to want to make themselves distinct from the competition and sideline companies they view as nothing more than outside suppliers that aren’t beholden to them. The problem? They suck at it. With very few exceptions, what Google and Apple have put together is superior to what the automakers have devised for themselves, and the automakers have the disadvantage that they don’t have the massive infrastructure available to leverage the capabilities of the “mothership” in some distant data center. Google and Apple can respond intelligently and accurately to all sorts of voice commands because they can farm your request out to a distant server farm and leverage immense amounts of computing power and knowledge about you to compute the answer. In addition, they have all sorts of UI engineers that have some faint clue how to do their jobs, which apparently is not a job requirement designing OEM infotainment GUIs. Speaking for myself (the proud owner of a ’17 CR-V), AA/CarPlay was on my list of “must-have” features for whatever car I purchased. Login to reply psarhjinian January 11th, 2017 at 2:34 pm Dear christ, this looks like an attempt to make the same mistakes as we made when we allowed cars to just slurp phones via BT OBEX (and get, quite literally, everything utterly wrong), combined with the mistakes we made when we thought that RPC & DCOM were just fantastic. Great article, by the way. Login to reply wristtwist January 12th, 2017 at 11:32 am Logged in to say this. I’d love to see more of this type of article, especially considering how much software is driving everything now. Login to reply 5280thinair January 11th, 2017 at 2:54 pm For an analogy, look at the the mobile phone market back when the carriers controlled what software you could put on your phone (pre iPhone). The carriers had little interest in updating the capabilities of the software because they made their money selling the devices. Want newer/better software? You’ll have to buy a new phone. If manufacturers push more of the capabilities into the cars hardware and built-in software, and rely less on the phones, then they can push that same paradigm: gaining new features means buying new hardware (in this case, a new car). I suspect that’s the real incentive here. Login to reply 28-Cars-Later January 11th, 2017 at 3:00 pm “Want newer/better software? You’ll have to buy a new phone.” This is still true. “If manufacturers push more of the capabilities into the cars hardware and built-in software, and rely less on the phones, then they can push that same paradigm” This was already happening to an extent (i.e. feature X misses the product launch and you have to buy it again two years in to get it). We’ve already discussed the concept of a permanent leasing society and planned obsolesce, it benefits you very little and industry very much. Login to reply 5280thinair January 11th, 2017 at 3:14 pm “This is still true.” Not nearly as much as it used to be. Buy a Pixel phone from Google, or an iPhone from Apple, and you’re typically able to install the next 2-3 major OS upgrades and get the majority of the new features without paying more money*. Contrast that to the pre-iPhone days when getting any new capabilities pretty much required a new phone. I agree other features are already like this with cars. I suspect the mfgs want that to happen with infotainment systems as well rather than let Google/Apple get you upgrades for free or by buying a newer device from them where no money goes to the car maker. *Yes some new features are tied to the hardware, but typically those are in the minority. And yes, with a lot of cheaper Android phones the carrier never makes OS updates available; you need to do your homework to determine which carriers/phones will get updates. Login to reply Dan Wallach January 12th, 2017 at 8:26 am “Want newer/better software? You’ll have to buy a new phone.” Sure, but a new phone is a few hundred bucks, and many people upgrade every two years. A new car is a whole lot more money and you upgrade much less frequently. So far, only Tesla seems to be serious about adding new features to older cars. Sure, they’re not retrofitting AutoPilot hardware into the cars made beforehand, but all of the software upgrades that run on older cars are released for them. Note that it’s not just about “features”. It’s also about bug-fixes, security-related and otherwise. It helps immensely that every Tesla connects home regularly to download updates.

I was at Motorola when the iPhone first was launched, and honestly, for a year or two we were excited because it was a seismic tilt in the power balance between carrier and device maker that we assumed would also benefit us. Note that when Moto came out with the OG Droid, it also was famed for being naked unskinned Android, instead of coming with all the VZW/ATT bloatware. But, Moto being Moto, we got our lunch eaten anyways, and I left years ago. Login to reply epsilonkore January 12th, 2017 at 6:53 pm You have to keep in mind that cars should stay on the road an average of 8 years (I think I read that somewhere) and the software should remain relevant during that time. Static hardware/software isn’t the way to go. I have had Apples CarPlay in my 2013 FR-S (Via Pioneers NEX headunit) since CarPlay 1 and my iPhone 5. Every iOS update bugs were squashed, features added, and performance improved. Every new iPhone (on iPhone 7+ now) resulted in even better CarPlay performance. Now my screen is instant in response (vs pretty fast on my iPhone 5 and 6) and the App library keeps expanding (I have over 30 CarPlay apps available, though only 10 are regularly used). Apples Maps went from crap compared to Pioneers built in, to vastly superior within 3 years. Comparing my parents 2013 Edge (complete with the latest Sync Firmware updates) that is still useful, but sluggish in comparison to my 2013 Pioneer head unit with CarPlay is night and day. Expensive map updates hurt the argument as well. Add to that Siri, now reaching into my home with HomeKit… I can turn on my climate control, unlock my locks, and turn on the lights from the dash of my car or from my voice. Sync and its voice recognition, is stuck where it was (despite updates), with zero outside connectivity. Leave the software to Apple/Google/Amazon (Ford and Hyundai using Alexa is a GOOD idea… though I wish it was powered by a regularly upgraded phone instead of a static in dash system). Just give us big screens to project to, and API’s that allow Siri/OK Google/Alexa to control the cars climate/locks/lights/NAV (but not safety systems, brakes, steering… yet…) and let the cloud be leveraged to keep everything super fast in a way that static hardware can’t keep up with. Login to reply S2k Chris January 11th, 2017 at 3:13 pm Didn’t see it addressed here, but I’ve heard/read that a lot of the fight is actually about who owns the mineable data resulting from usage. If Apple/Google use the car as a display, all of the data stays on the Apple/Googled device for viewing/mining/use by A/G. If the work is done in the car, then all of the sudden the car makers own this data and can do what they will with it. Right Wrong Indifferent? Login to reply 5280thinair January 11th, 2017 at 3:23 pm I hadn’t thought about that, but it’s likely correct. Login to reply JMII January 11th, 2017 at 3:31 pm I would guess this is a driving (no pun intended) factor behind it. Remember its ALL about the data! The current business model (that everyone learned from the Google) is: this service is free, in exchange for free we record/track everything you do, since you do lots of stuff we then have lots to sell to others thus ensure this service stays free, plus these others can sell you more stuff allow the loop to go on forever. Honestly car OEMs have proven to be terrible at doing this kind of thing (OS, GUI, NAV, etc). So the CarPlay model seems 1,000 times better. So what is the smart OEM to do? I suggest they work on model specific apps and provide hooks into those via the car level connection. For example a “My Honda” app tells me when to change my oil, what my tires pressures are, current and past gas mileage, etc. Then using the phone’s push notification system interact with the customer that way. Instead it appears they are just going to make an over complicated mess that will never work and become abandon-ware as soon as the next model is released. Login to reply sgeffe January 11th, 2017 at 7:29 pm Just as navigation upgrades are in systems tied to the car. Empty wallet into plate alongside you, drop your pants. Login to reply Dan Wallach January 12th, 2017 at 2:37 pm I’ll probably need to write a whole new essay on this point, but here are the broad outlines of the issue. The name of the game is, of course, how to make money out of adding a car into the mix of information that’s already floating around in your phone. Here’s a simple example: how about radio advertisements customized to you? Just based on what you’re driving and where you are, an advertiser can infer an awful lot about who you are. If all the audio is streaming from your phone, then the carmaker gets nothing. Even without the customization, I’ll bet Pandora pays some kind of royalty to have their Pandora button built into your car. In the Apple/Google universe, Pandora does the integration work exactly twice (once for iOS and once for Android), and every automaker does the work twice (again, once for iOS and once for Android), and then poof, Pandora works in every car rolling down the road. No need to strike a royalty agreement with each automaker. No fuss, no worries. That’s something that Pandora would almost certainly prefer, although it does put Apple and Google in a central position to mediate what’s going on. If those two companies say “no GPS for you!” then Pandora can’t do location-specific advertising. If they hide the make/model of the car, then Pandora can’t use that to infer other things about you.

Login to reply zamoti January 12th, 2017 at 1:53 pm I for one, don’t believe that we should just accept this progression that’s being thrust upon us by a group of people that presume to know better than everyone else. As noted earlier, there is a ton of data to mine from cars, but it doesn’t serve the end user in any meaingful way. Sure we get cute apps that give us navigation and music, but what about something actually useful? In most modern cars, the infotainment system (aka, radio) is integrated into and has access to a variety of critical systems that reside on the CAN bus. WHY?!?! Why on earth does the radio need to talk to the ABS/traction control systems, or the ECU or any other non-infotainment (excepting HVAC maybe)? For many years we’ve had cars with complicated drive systems, transmisions, active suspension and they’ve had their own SEPARATE interfaces, that is a button or knob on the console somewhere. Now we need to shove all of this into a bright pretty toy for what reason? What problem is being solved with this? Worst of all, even with all of this information being fed to the dash computer, we STILL rely on a stupid check engine light! No clue as to what is wrong, some cars have some info, but usually nothing with any amount of detail. If there were a real benefit to the user, the carputer would provide a detailed narrative of what an issue is and even offer to send that data to a service center for advice. We could have remote diagnosis cost tracking (dollars per mile) but we don’t. Instead we’re all worried that our stupid phone won’t play music or share an address book in just the right way. I believe that there should be a full and hard separation of CAN bus systems from the infotainment system. Given that there has been no move toward benefit to the user and a LOT of risk for remote exploitation and unwanted surveillance, I don’t see any reason why they should communicate at all. Furthermore, there should be a common interface for these in-dash systems that will allow users to have them removed and/or updated and (God forbid) even changed for a different unit as the user sees fit. Instead of just being used to having our collective skin crawl, it seems that the media at large should be on point to call out these issues and question the WHY of what is happening instead of just asking useless questions like “will it connect to my old iPhone?” Login to reply Dan Wallach January 12th, 2017 at 2:41 pm Why not use completely separate buses? Two reasons: 1) Money. It’s all about the money. The more you integrate things, the lower your costs. 2) Features. Let’s say everybody decides to follow Tesla’s lead, and do everything on a giant touchscreen. That means HVAC controls, audio, phone, external networking, never mind various car controls like suspension settings, acceleration limits, and more. If you want all those features, that means your computer is going to be issuing CANbus requests to all the appropriate devices. Even in cars where you’ve got separate physical buttons for HVAC, stereo, etc., they’re probably still going with integrated electronics, since it saves money.

Smartphones running Google's Android operating system didn't exactly log stellar holiday sales, new data from Kantar Worldpanel ComTech shows. The research firm on Tuesday reported that Android sales dropped in the US, Great Britain, and France in the three-month period ending November 2016. At the same time, Apple's iOS "continued to make gains across most regions," Kantar said. This marks the sixth consecutive period of decline for Android in the US, the firm said. Google's mobile OS now accounts for 55.3 percent of all smartphones sales, down from 60.4 percent a year earlier. Apple, on the other hand, was sitting pretty at the beginning of the holiday period. Its iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, and iPhone 6s were the three most popular smartphones in the US, accounting for a combined 31.3 percent share of the market. In the midst of its exploding smartphone gaffe, Samsung had the fourth and fifth most popular handsets in the US—the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge—and captured 28.9 percent of smartphone sales. Verizon helped peddle a lot of Apple and Samsung phones in the US, partly thanks to its attractive free phone promotion. "Verizon booked nearly a quarter of all US smartphone sales during the Black Friday period, playing a vital role for all brands, including Apple and Samsung," Kantar Worldpanel ComTech Consumer Insight Director Lauren Guenveur said in a statement. "Buyers were motivated by Verizon's promotions on both Apple and Samsung's top phones, including offers of free iPhone 7, 7 Plus, and Galaxy S7 phones after trade-in and purchase requirements were met." Related The Best Upcoming Phones of 2017 The Best Upcoming Phones of 2017 While overall Android sales decreased in the US over the past year, the new Pixel phone "made strong gains, rising to 1.3 percent of sales" during the period, Kantar reported. Things played out differently in China, where Android continued to dominate the market, accounting for nearly 80 percent of all smartphone sales during the period, according to Kantar Worldpanel ComTech Asia's Strategic Insight Director Tamsin Timpson. Apple's iOS dropped to 19.9 percent share in urban China from 25.3 percent a year ago, but saw a 2.8 percentage point uptick over the previous three month period, thanks to iPhone 7 sales. Meanwhile, across Europe's big five markets — Great Britain, Germany, France, Italy, and Spain — both iOS and Android made gains. Android accounted for 72.4 percent of smartphone sales there during the period while iOS captured 24.6 percent — "a strong year-on-year uptick for both ecosystems," Kantar Worldpanel ComTech Europe Business Unit Director Dominic Sunnebo said.

Here's how these home screen images can be used to kick off a group project and determine what tools the team should use. By Andy Wolber | January 11, 2017, 9:16 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Andy Wolber / TechRepublic Project kickoff meetings can be a challenge, especially when a group of people have never worked together before. An adept project leader needs to manage all the details, while at the same time working to build personal trust among group members. Things get more complicated when group members are from different organizations. More about Mobility Goalmap: Set and track goals easily via this Android app How to improve the security and privacy of your iPhone: 5 steps Alibaba's YunOS overtakes iOS in China, but what is it? Subscribe to TechRepublic's Mobile Enterprise newsletter As an IT person, you're well-positioned to set the group up for success by asking people to share a screenshot of their smartphone home screen. I have done this by creating a presentation, with one slide for each person on the project. I put each person's name on a Google Slide, then share the slides with the group and give every project member editing privileges. Then, I ask people to add a screenshot of their phone home screen. Home screen screenshots provide a glimpse of the apps that people value and use. Additionally, discussion of the apps works well as a group icebreaker, and also opens up the chance for a serious discussion about group collaboration and communication. (Unless, of course, people in the group have locked down phones with pre-installed apps. In which case, this exercise only reveals IT's absolute control.) Here's what to look for, and how to get the conversation going. Discover priorities and preferences First, look low. If the apps on the bottom row of the screen are not the default set of apps, then the apps likely reflect the person's preferences or priorities, since you can access these apps from any screen. For example, on an iPhone, my default four apps are Tweetbot, Google Docs, Safari, and Hangouts. Sometimes an app that isn't present on the home screen also conveys information. For example, there's no Phone app on my home screen. Instead, I make most of my voice calls with two other home screen apps: Hangouts (with Google Voice) and Signal. Next, ask people to talk about their most valued apps: What are the apps they view as "core" or "essential"? Most people are happy to talk about apps they find useful. Discuss collaboration tools: One task, one tool Look for communication and group collaboration tools. For example: What tools do team members prefer for communication? SMS? Video? Chat in Slack? Facebook Messenger? Twitter DMs? Skype? Hangouts? A traditional voice-only call? When people need to work together, a "one task, one tool" approach minimizes confusion. It helps if everyone agrees on which tool to use for a task: Post project updates to... whatever tool makes the most sense to the group Create new documents with... whatever tool makes the most sense for the group Track tasks with... whatever tool makes the most sense for the group, and so on Getting to the clarity of "one task, one tool" can be deceptively difficult. Take checklists, for example. If your organization uses G Suite, you could track tasks in at least four different apps: Tasks (in Gmail), Google Docs, Google Keep, or Google Sheets. The home screen snapshots can help you choose an app that people already use. And, don't worry about app differences for apps that aren't aimed at collaboration or communication. If you use the Gmail app, and I use the Inbox by Gmail app, it doesn't matter. We can each still send and receive email. Start a security conversation A look at home screen apps can also prompt a security conversation. Look for password management and two-factor authentication code generator apps. Recognize people who clearly take steps to protect data. Better yet, make sure those are part of your organization's standard mobile device setup and deployment procedures. Or, use the opportunity to mention mobile management approaches, such as the Google Device Policy app to keep work and personal data secure and separate on devices. Finally, if you notice an app that clearly can cause a problem—such as an insecure or known malware app—don't call out the offending person in front of the group. Instead, approach the person after the meeting to address the issue. Fix the security problem individually to help establish understanding and build trust. What do you think? Have you used home screen snapshots to help introduce team members to one another? What do the apps on your home screen suggest about your preferences and priorities?

To answer the growing demand for cloud storage, new cloud suppliers are setting up datacentres in the region. Southeast Asia’s cloud market is already well populated by the big players – AWS, Microsoft, IBM, HP, Oracle – and a host of smaller datacentre and managed IT services providers. Alibaba Cloud and Google Cloud have both set up in Singapore recently to attract Asean customers.  “With the entrance of Alibaba and Google into the cloud storage market, enterprise IT decision makers have a wider choice of services, and this will benefit those who are able to develop a cloud model – be it immersing their business fully in the cloud or implementing a hybrid cloud model,” said Rick Scurfield, president at NetApp APAC. According to Andy Cocks, CTO at Dimension Data Asia Pacific, the biggest impact of the entry of cloud storage providers in this region will felt by small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). “Looking at some of the top traditional storage suppliers in the market, growth is limited in the marketplace and these numbers are pretty flat,” he said. “With the move to cloud, hyperscale providers such as Amazon and Microsoft Azure and new entrants such as Alibaba Cloud and Google Cloud will cause a significant impact for SMBs.” Cocks suggested a complete shift to cloud storage was generally considered too risky for enterprise companies because of mission-critical applications or sensitive information, such as in the finance, healthcare or government sectors, and they are concerned with security risks and the lack of data sovereignty that is associated with cloud platforms. “As such, it will be mostly SMBs that will be the ones moving their storage to the cloud, especially since more new applications are coming up on cloud,” he said. “For instance, startups are using cloud providers to run their applications, without having to build infrastructure.” Read more about enterprise storage in Asean More than half of Apac-based IT decision makers expect budgets to rise next year and cloud-related projects look the likely destination of the extra money. If organisations are to benefit from the promise of big data, they must get on top of a legal and regulatory minefield when it comes to storing data. How are Asean IT departments navigating this? Are all-flash arrays the hottest storage technology in Asean and is it only a matter of time before flash will replace hard drives for all hot and warm data? Paul Serrano, chief evangelist at Nutanix Asia Pacific and Japan, said: “As enterprise IT departments evaluate both public and on-premise clouds in 2017, they will come to the conclusion that public clouds are better suited to elastic workloads – which means workloads that have undetermined requirements.” But he said it might be too early for many to move into the public cloud. For Prabhitha Sheethal Dcruz, senior market analyst services research at IDC Asia/Pacific, Southeast Asian organisations are not moving to the cloud quickly enough. “Organisations in Southeast Asia have been rather slow in adopting cloud,” she said. “The Asean market is less mature, and its inherent conservatism has so far limited AWS, Google and Azure penetration to mostly discrete workloads, and the local cloud providers have yet to build their capabilities to a level where they will be accepted by the larger enterprises.” But Dcruz said that with the entry of companies such as Alibaba Cloud and Google Cloud, customers would begin to move their second-tier steady-state workloads to a cloud infrastructure. Alibaba succeeds in China According to IDC’s six-monthly public cloud tracker for the first half of 2016, Alibaba was the number two provider for cloud services in Asia Pacific (excluding Japan), outpacing Microsoft and Google. “However, Alibaba’s success has been restricted to China alone and its lack of an extensive partner ecosystem outside China will mean that it won’t make any significant impact on the market except at Chinese companies with operations outside China, and Asean companies doing business in China,” said Dcruz. “The reality of the enterprise market will force Alibaba into a secondary role, with its partners taking the lead on engagement. To target the enterprise market with any credibility, Alibaba needs to build a partner ecosystem to match its rivals.” But Nishchal Khorana, director cloud and datacentre Asia Pacific at Frost & Sullivan, does not see such limited prospects for Alibaba Cloud. “From a longer-term perspective, it is critical to note that the Asean cloud storage market is highly price-sensitive, giving an opportunity to Alibaba Cloud to emerge as a key supplier in the region given its aggressive pricing strategies,” he said. However, it will be a while before Alibaba Cloud emerges, said Khorana. “Indonesia, Malaysia and Philippines are the fastest-growing cloud infrastructure markets in Asean, with the infrastructure-as-a-service [IaaS] market estimated to grow at a rate of 40 to 50% a year from 2015 to 2022. While Alibaba Cloud and Google are well positioned to tap into the growth of the cloud storage markets in these markets, Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure will still hold the dominant positions in the near future due to their well-established presence.” Will on-premise storage market shrink? According to Khorana, the growth of on-premise storage will be slower as cloud models gain maturity, with increased focus on enterprise security, and enterprises increasingly transition to a hosted private, public cloud or hybrid IT model. “Overall, the on-premise storage market will remain relatively stable, without significant shrinkage in the coming years,” said Dimension Data’s Cocks. James Woo, CIO at Farrer Park, a Singapore-based healthcare and hospitality real estate company, said: “I doubt on-premise storage is going to shrink that quickly, because it will take time for organisations to re-engineer their infrastructure to work with cloud storage.” Towards a hybrid model According to Dcruz at IDC, Asean organisations are still positioned in the “ad hoc and opportunistic stages of IDC’s maturity framework”. She added that the heterogeneous state of the Asean region meant not all countries would follow similar adoption patterns, and some countries may be faster than others in adopting cloud storage for more complex use cases. “Current adoption is mostly restricted to data backup, data protection or disaster recovery,” she said. “With more provider options and appealing price points, cloud storage may be an attractive proposition for many organisations, but various legislative, cultural and political implications make cloud unpalatable for Asean governments that are promoting in-country cloud solutions.” CW+ Features Enjoy the benefits of CW+ membership, learn more and join.

By Conner Forrest | January 11, 2017, 9:00 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStockphoto/BrianAJackson On Wednesday, Google announced that a new encryption tool called the Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) would be coming to the Google Cloud Platform, in beta, for certain markets. The service, which aims to make encryption key management easier and more scalable, could entice companies in industries like finance and healthcare to leverage Google Cloud. According to a press release, the service "offers a cloud-based root of trust that you can monitor and audit." It is easier to maintain than an ad-hoc key management solution, or one that was custom built, Google stated. Cloud KMS will allow users to manage symmetric encryption keys that encrypt data stored within Google's Cloud Platform, as well as data that is stored in other environments, the release said. The service is integrated with other security features in Google Cloud, including Cloud Identity Access Management and Cloud Audit Logging, according to the release. Users can utilize the Cloud KMS API to rotate, use, create, and destroy keys. SEE: Google Cloud Platform: The smart person's guide Ravelin, a fraud detection provider, is one of the early adopters of KMS. Leonard Austin, CTO at Ravelin, explained in the press release that his company utilizes features such as automatic key rotation to stay compliant with internal policies.

This allows us to expand the scope of the data we choose to encrypt from sensitive data, to operational data that does not need to be indexed," Austin wrote in the release. Cloud KMS uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM), according to the release. This is the same encryption that Google uses in Google Cloud Storage, and it is also used in the BoringSSL library. Google Cloud Storage will default to managing server-side encryption keys for users, so you'll need to choose to use KMS if you want to manage any cloud-based keys on your own, the release said. Additionally, by selecting the Customer Supplied Encryption Keys option, users can manage keys on-premises. With the beta launch, KMS joins a host of other encryption services on Google Cloud Platform, and follows the announcements of Google adding HSTS encryption to google.com. Google has also added a section for HTTPS data in its transparency report, and has given advice to businesses looking to make the switch. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers Google's new Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) could make encryption key management easier and more scalable than ad-hoc or custom management tools. KMS works with keys that encrypt data on the Google Cloud Platform, and with data encrypted elsewhere. Google Cloud Storage will still manage server-side encryption keys for the user if desired, and will do so by default.

At the time Google noted, “It’s still early days, but atmospheric satellites could help bring internet access to millions of people, and help solve other problems, including disaster relief and environmental damage like deforestation.” Titan previously said that its drones could collect real-time, high-resolution images of the earth, carry other atmospheric sensors and support voice and data services. A video of the Titan Aerospace Solara 50 can be seen below… The Titan division was absorbed into X in late 2015 from the Access and Energy division during the Alphabet re-shuffle. Since the pickup, Google has revealed other internal Drone-projects including project Black Rock and Project Wing delivery drones as well as a Tango-based prototype. Android ecosystem partners are also building their own drones albeit for more consumer purposes. In mid-2015 Titan team experienced a crash in the Arizona desert which was in 2016 revealed to be a wing fault. Later last year, under the moniker ‘Skybender’ reports surfaced from Spaceport America in New Mexico that Google planned to use 5G technology to provide wide area internet, but the team there seemed to be experiencing significant problems. Later, components were installed upside down or supplied by Google without the necessary shelves, nuts and bolts. Near the end of the build in October, Mike Bashore, information systems manager at Spaceport America, even emailed to his Google contact, “We want to run out to Home Depot for grounding straps.” These are needed to protect sensitive electronics from static electricity. The nearest Home Depot hardware shop is over 100 miles from the Spaceport. We’ve now heard and Alphabet has confirmed, that the Titan group was shut down and engineers were told to look for other jobs within Alphabet/Google in the coming months. Over 50 employees were involved in the process. The Titan Team has been dispersing to other groups including the Project Loon effort, which similarly aims to distribute internet via high altitude balloons. An X spokesperson provided the following statement: The team from Titan was brought into X in early 2016. We ended our exploration of high-altitude UAVs for internet access shortly after. By comparison, at this stage the economics and technical feasibility of Project Loon present a much more promising way to connect rural and remote parts of the world. Many people from the Titan team are now using their expertise as part of other high flying projects at X, including Loon and Project Wing. As far as “Internet from the sky”, Google also heavily invested in SpaceX in 2015 and with Fidelity owned 10% of the Elon Musk-founded Space company. A report earlier claimed that Google’s investment would “support the development of SpaceX satellites that could beam low-cost Internet around the globe to billions who don’t have it.” Guides Alphabet View THe Guide X View THe Guide Titan View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

The functionality has been limited to only certain levels of Local Guides users, but now Google is finally expanding the program. As brought to attention by TechCrunch, Google has recently updated the qualifications for getting access to this feature. The company recently emailed participants of its Local Guides program to notify them that lists are now available to all users at Level 2 or higher on both Android and iOS. Previously, Google limited this to Android only and Level 4 or higher users. Google determines Local Guides levels based on participation and contributions, such as reviews or local photos. Google Maps’ lists enable users of the app to save locations for easy access, such as commonly visited places, places you’d like to visit, or more specific uses, such as saving nearby grocery stores. Needless to say, this is a feature that would be useful for anyone, but Google has to reveal any information regarding a public launch. To create a new list of places, users can head into the Google Maps application, access a location, tap on the name or address, and save it to a pre-made or custom list. To later access those, users can go into the menu, find the “Your places” section, and see all of the lists you’ve created.

But it’s also hard. So hard that only a few developers, usually trained in quantum physics, advanced mathematics, or most likely both, can actually work with the few quantum computers that exist. Now D-Wave, the Canadian company behind the quantum computer that Google and NASA have been testing since 2013, wants to make quantum computing a bit easier through the power of open source software. Traditional computers store information in “bits,” which can represent either a “1” or a “0.” Quantum computing takes advantage of quantum particles in a strange state called “superposition,” meaning that the particle is spinning in two directions at once. Researchers have learned to take advantage of these particles to create what they call “qubits,” which can represent both a 1 and a 0 at the same time. By stringing qubits together, companies like D-Wave hope to create computers that are exponentially faster than today’s machines. Related Stories The Revolutionary Quantum Computer That May Not Be Quantum at All IBM Is Now Letting Anyone Play With Its Quantum Computer Quantum Computers Don’t Make Sense. But This One Makes Music IBM demonstrated a working quantum computer in 2000 and continues to improve on its technology. Google is working on its own quantum computer and also teamed up with NASA to test D-Wave’s system in 2013. Lockheed Martin and the Los Alamos National Laboratory are also working with D-Wave machines. But today’s quantum computers still aren’t practical for most real-world applications. qubits are fragile and can be easily knocked out of the superposition state. Meanwhile, quantum computers are extremely difficult to program today because they require highly specialized knowledge. “D-Wave is driving the hardware forward,” says D-Wave International president Bo Ewald. “But we need more smart people thinking about applications, and another set thinking about software tools.” That’s where the company’s new software tool Qbsolv comes in. Qbsolv is designed to help developers program D-Wave machines without needing a background in quantum physics. A few of D-Wave’s partners are already using the tool, but today the company released Qbsolv as open source, meaning anyone will be able to freely share and modify the software. “Not everyone in the computer science community realizes the potential impact of quantum computing,” says Fred Glover, a mathematician at the University of Colorado, Boulder who has been working with Qbsolv. “Qbsolv offers a tool that can make this impact graphically visible, by getting researchers and practitioners involved in charting the future directions of quantum computing developments.” qubits for All Qbsolv joins a small but growing pool of tools for would-be quantum computer programmers. Last year Scott Pakin of Los Alamos National Laboratory–and one of Qbsolv’s first users–released another free tool called Qmasm, which also eases the burden of writing code for D-Wave machines by freeing developers from having to worry about addressing the underlying hardware. The goal, Ewald says, is to kickstart a quantum computing software tools ecosystem and foster a community of developers working on quantum computing problems. In recent years, open source software has been the best way to build communities of both independent developers and big corporate contributors. Of course to actually run the software you create with these tools, you’ll need access to one of the very few existing D-Wave machines. In the meantime, you can download a D-Wave simulator that will let you test the software on your own computer. Obviously this won’t be the same as running it on a piece of hardware that uses real quantum particles, but it’s a start. Related Video The Beautiful Relationship Between Physics and Jazz Last year, IBM launched a cloud-based service that enables people to run their own programs on the company’s quantum computer. But at least for the moment, Qbsolv and Qmasm will only be useful for creating applications for D-Wave’s hardware. D-Wave’s machines take a radically different approach to computing than traditional computers, or even other quantum computing prototypes. While most computers—ranging from your smartphone to IBM’s quantum computer—are general purpose, meaning they can be programmed to solve all sort of problems, D-Wave’s machines are designed for a single purpose: solving optimization problems. The classic example is known as the traveling salesman problem: calculating the shortest route that passes through a list of specific locations. In the early days, critics wondered whether D-Wave’s expensive machines were even quantum computers at all, but most researchers now seem to agree that the machines do exhibit quantum behavior. “There are very few doubts left that there are indeed quantum effects at work and that they play a meaningful computational role,” University of Southern California researcher Daniel Lidar told us in 2015 after Google and NASA released a research paper detailing some of their work with the D-Wave. The big question now is whether D-Waves are actually any faster than traditional computers, and if its unique approach is better than that taken by IBM and other researchers. Pakin says his team are believers in D-Wave’s potential, even though they admit its systems might not yet offer performance improvements except in very narrow cases. He also explains that D-Wave’s computers don’t necessarily provide the most efficient answers to an optimization problem—or even a correct one. Instead, the idea is to provide solutions that are probably good, if not perfect solutions, and to do it very quickly. That narrows the D-Wave machines’ usefulness to optimization problems that need to be solved fast but don’t need to be perfect. That could include many artificial intelligence applications. Ideally, however, the hardware and software will improve to the point that other types of computing problems can be translated into optimization problems, and Qbsolv and Qmasm are steps towards building exactly that. But to get there, they’ll need more than just open source software. They’ll need an open source community. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

Of the 3.2 Gigawatts of renewable energy purchased in 2015, more than two-thirds of that was from internet companies, Greenpeace notes. Some vendors are better than others at going green though. Apple, Google and Facebook have led the field in years past and do so once again in Greenpeace’s 2016 wrap-up report. Switch, the Las Vegas-based data center and collocation provider, is named a leader for the first time. Greenpeace calls out AWS for needing to do more. The Canadian-based environmental advocacy group says AWS has taken “important steps” in recent years, but they haven’t gone far enough. “Given AWS’s continued lack of transparency and its rapid growth in Virginia and other markets largely served by dirty energy, it remains unclear whether the AWS cloud is actually on a path to becoming renewably powered,” the Greenpeace report notes. Greenpeace says AWS, along with Asian data center provider Tencent, LG CNS and Baidu are each leaders in their respective markets, which “(makes) their lack of movement toward more transparency even more egregious.” Greenpeace AWS, for its part, has committed to being 100% powered by renewable energy, and it most recently said it hopes to be half way to its goal by the end of this year. “AWS has to date enabled 10 renewable energy projects in the United States that will deliver a grand total of 2.6 million MWh of energy annually onto the electric grid powering AWS data centers and four of these projects are already online,” an AWS spokesperson said. “That said, we are nowhere near done. We will continue to make progress toward our 100 percent goal and have many exciting initiatives planned.” Greenpeace gave AWS an overall grade of “C”, but gave it an F for energy transparency and C grades for energy efficiency and mitigation and renewable procurement. Meanwhile, AWS’s biggest competitors in the IaaS public cloud market are leaders in Greenpeace’s report. ALSO ON NETWORK WORLD: Whatever happened to Green IT? Google received and overall “A” grade, with a B in transparency and A's for mitigation and renewable procurement; Microsoft meanwhile got an overall B grade, with B's for mitigation and procurement. By comparison, some of Asia’s largest web services vendors like Baidu and Tencent got overall failing grades. See the full list of Greenpeace’s scores for Internet companies here. Greenpeace says one of the most disturbing trends is the growth of data centers in areas like Asia and Virginia, where there are limited options to power those operations from green energy. Greenpeace While some IaaS cloud vendors argue that a shift to using public cloud resources is good for the environment – because it consolidates workloads into providers who have a better opportunity to use green energy – Greenpeace questions this claim. “The transition to the cloud could in fact increase the demand for coal and other fossil fuels despite significant gains in energy efficiency and adoption of a commitment to 100% renewable energy because of the dramatic growth in new data center construction by cloud and collocation companies such as AWS and Digital Realty in Virginia and other hot spots that have some of the lowest percentages of renewable electricity in the U.S.” Tech vendors have an opportunity to drive toward a green energy future: Greenpeace estimates that the IT sector consumes more energy than Russia, Japan and India; only the U.S. and China consume more energy than the aggregate IT international sector.

Pexels You may have noticed that Google Calendar has been adding new features lately. You can find time for your goals, and set reminders, for example. I played a very small part in these features, but I learned a lot about my own productivity in the process. I was an advisor to Timeful, a productivity app co-founded by behavioral scientist Dan Ariely, which was bought by Google. Many of these new features originated with Timeful, and I’m sure new features are yet to come. My role with Timeful was to talk to their product designers about integrating a cohesive productivity philosophy into the app. Productivity is about mind management, not time management, and while simple tools — such as to-do items — are useful, they don’t account for the shortcomings of real human behavior. I can’t take credit for any particular Timeful (or Google Calendar) feature, but throughout the process, I was forced to think hard about my own productivity philosophy, and how best to implement it into my life. Here are the main things I learned: You’re bad at estimating time My favorite Timeful feature (which I hope becomes a Google Calendar feature) was that you could set time estimates for to-do items, and actually drag them onto the calendar. It makes sense that if you have a list of things you want to do, there should be some plan about when you’ll fit those things into your schedule. By estimating times, then seeing how well I did with those estimates, I learned that I was bad at estimating how long things would take. We’re all bad at it. Daniel Kahneman calls it The Planning Fallacy. To fight this, start scheduling and estimating how much time it will take you to do certain tasks. When you see how far off you are, you’ll get better at making realistic estimates. Start habits small “Goals” is one Timeful feature that is now in Google Calendar. You say what you want to do, and how often, and Google Calendar finds time in your schedule. I have control over my schedule, so I don’t need Google Calendar to schedule my habits, but I learned through experimentation to start with a small habit—a ridiculously easy habit — and, yes, put it on the calendar. You can only muster so much willpower to do a thing. If it’s easy, you can do it regularly, then up the goal. When you build upon this, anything is possible. Weekly routines, not daily routines Your energy levels and mind state changes throughout the week. You should work accordingly. For example, I learned to make Monday and Tuesdays (especially mornings) my prime creative time on my most important project. Later on in the week, as my discipline wanes, is for meetings and administrative stuff. This isn’t so much a Timeful “feature” as it is what Timeful was intended to become: an AI that tells you the best time to do the things that you intend to do. In determining the “best” time, your mind state is every bit as important as what time it is. (I don’t have any insight into how close Timeful got to cracking that, but I at least learned it for myself.) You might have noticed, you don’t necessarily need an app to integrate these things into your life. Get realistic about how long things take you, just how much willpower you have, and when your ups and downs are, and you’ll be well on your way to optimal productivity.

Tomo said this on January 6th: A quick update to say that the Search team has pushed a fix for iOS that enables the AMP top bar to scroll away in Chrome and Safari. Please let me know if you see any issues. The team is also still working on creating a direct path from AMP pages on Google Search to the canonical URL as specified by the publisher (usually the non-AMP original URL) and URL sharing functionality. Please keep your feedback coming! I tried to to do this myself but can't get the AMP top bar to scroll away in Safari on my iOS device. Clearly I am missing something. If you now how to replicate this, please share it in the comments. Forum discussion at Google Webmaster Help.

Google's Gary Illyes told us almost a year ago that the command is not gone but truth is, I don't think any SEO felt comfortable with the results for about a year. This morning on Twitter, in response to a complaint about the link operator results, Google's John Mueller said he advises against using the link operator. He didn't say why, he just said, don't use it. @kunjan_13 @methode @rustybrick would probably tell you not to use the link operator in search. 🤷— John ☆.o(≧▽≦)o.☆ (@JohnMu) January 11, 2017 Of course, Google does have a link report for webmasters in the Google Search Console but that doesn't give you competitive link data. I am surprised so many SEOs still even bother looking at the link operator still. Forum discussion at Twitter.

You can download and update your version of the Play Store using the link at the bottom of this page. The update to v7.4 isn’t a large one, in fact there are mostly just bug fixes and such in this update. However, there are a number of hints at what may be coming in the near future, as Google has begun adding code for upcoming features. According to the code found in this version of the Google Play Store, we may be looking at an updated layout for the “My Apps & Games” page in the Play Store. As there are mentions of “v2” in this version of the app. Additionally, there is other code available that shows that users may be getting new ways to sort their apps and games in this section. It appears that you’ll be able to sort alphabetically, last updated, last used and by size. Which can make it pretty easy to find an app or game, especially if you’ve been using Android for years and have a long list of installed apps and games. Another feature that appears to be coming to the Play Store is the ability to approve Family Library purchases. For instance, if you have a family account setup with yourself, your spouse and your kids, and your kids want to buy something, you have to use their device to approve it. But not anymore. The owner of the account will soon be able to approve the purchase from their device, making it much simpler for everyone, especially if everyone isn’t in the same room or even the same building. Some of this functionality appears to be available in the Google Play Store right now, but it isn’t 100% working just yet. So this could be a server-side update in the coming weeks. Finally, we have a feature for developers here. The Google Play Store is going to begin allowing developers to see review statistics for the past 30 days, last three months and the last six months. So you can see how reviews have changed over the course of the past six months, which could be fairly useful. For those that don’t have the update to v7.4, you can download it using the link below and sideload it onto your device.

By Larry Dignan for Between the Lines | January 11, 2017 -- 17:00 GMT (09:00 PST) | Topic: Cloud Image: Google Google Cloud Platform is rolling out an encryption key management service with a beta in several countries.

CES 2017 recap video: Big trends, top products, and wackiest tech The service, Google Cloud Key Management Service, allows customers to manage their own encryption keys. With the move, Google Cloud is filling a gap that many enterprises need to move workloads to the cloud. For instance, Box made the move to give keys to customers years ago. Regulated industries need control of their encryption keys. Amazon Web Services has a key management service and Microsoft Azure has a service called Key Vault. Google Cloud said its key management service will be integrated with its identity access and audit logging services. The key management service uses the Advanced Encryption Standard and tools that Google uses to encrypt data in its Google Cloud Storage. The system continually checks for weaknesses.

Home Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Packages Skip links Skip to primary navigation Skip to content Skip to primary sidebar Home Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Packages 12 Tips & Tricks to Help You Make the Most Out of Whatsapp 304Shares FacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsappLinkedinPrint Syed Zarar 6 days ago There is no doubt that WhatsApp Messenger is one of the most popular application across all mobile platforms. The messenger has over one billion active users. With the new updates rolling in, it is tough to keep track of all the updates. ProPakistani has created a guide of all the old and new tips and tricks which can prove useful for you. Have a look! Formatting The Messages WhatsApp allows you to format your messages and then send them. This feature has been around for a while but many people still don’t know how to properly use them. The three formatting techniques which WhatsApp offers are italic, bold and strike through. To use them, encapsulate the text as below: _Italic_ *Bold* ~ Strike through~ Use WhatsApp in a Web Browser For people who prefer typing on the keyboards, they can use their WhatsApp in a web browser. All you need to do is open the WhatsApp web version and scan the bar code which appears on the website from your smartphone. After that, all your chats will be displayed in the browser. You can send messages, images and videos from the WhatsApp web version. Transfer Files To PC via WhatsApp Often times, it is a hurdle to find the data cable and attach it to the PC to transfer files. As a substitute, you can save your own number in your phone and send the files to your own WhatsApp chat. With the WhatsApp web already logged in, you can receive the files on your PC and download them there. Backup & Restore WhatsApp Conversations Often times people end up deleting their data or losing their smartphones. If such a situation occurs, you can still retrieve your WhatsApp chats and media through this method. WhatsApp lets you backup all of your chats including media to Google Drive. To do this you have to tap Menu button and then Settings > Chats > Chat backup. Then tap on Back up to Google Drive. You will be prompted to select the Google Account you want to choose to backup your data. You can also set backup frequency (daily, weekly, monthly), backup over WiFi only or manually backup by pressing “Backup Now” button. To restore, install WhatsApp on your new phone, sign up and go to the same settings menu, link your account and click Restore. You can copy or backup conversations to your email as well. In order to do that, open the chat you want to save. Then click Options > More > Email chat. After that, follow the on-screen instructions. Know When Someone Read Your Message Majority of the people already know that one grey tick means that the message has been sent, two grey ticks imply that message has been delivered and blue ticks indicate that the message has been read by the recipient. However, there is another option to check all of the above things. Not only that, it also shows the exact time stamp. To see the message information or  the sent message details, open a chat, tap and hold any sent message, then tap the info (or i) button from the action bar (top). Star Important Messages It is always difficult to scroll hundreds and thousands of messages to find something you were looking for. Suppose a friend suggests a good song or give you his address, instead of scrolling and finding it later on, you can star the messages. To mark a message as favorite, you just need to long press on any individual message, then tap on the star icon in the action bar at the top of the application’s screen. To revisit the messages, click on Options in the conversation list screen and choose Starred Messages. Hide Chats From The WhatsApp List Do you have nosy family members or friends who like to keep tabs on you? It is always a problem if that is the case. Previously, WhatsApp offered no support for hiding conversations. The only solution was to delete the conversations. However, now, you can hide them. Here’s how: Tap and hold a particular chat and click the archive button in the action bar to archive that conversation. To view all archived chats by scrolling to the bottom in the conversation list screen then click Archived chats. Hide WhatsApp Media From Your Gallery If you like to keep things organized in your gallery and don’t want the incoming WhatsApp media to show up in your gallery then this trick is for you. All you need to do is open File Manager and browse to Internal storage WhatsApp > Media and Rename two folders. To rename: WhatsApp Images and WhatsApp Videos. Rename to: (dot)WhatsApp Images and (dot)WhatsApp Video. Note:  (dot) represents the punctuation dot. Through this trick, you can hide images and videos in your gallery but you can view them in your WhatsApp and your File Manager as well. Another key thing to mention here is that this trick only works on Android phones. Use Multiple WhatsApp Accounts People who own a dual-SIM smartphone are often faced with the dilemma of using only one WhatsApp account. There are third-party applications through which you can achieve the goal but those means aren’t always the most effective. For this trick to work, it is necessary for you to own a smartphone which is upgraded to Lollipop OS. Go to Android’s Settings > Users > Add user. After you have created a new user, log in using the new account, install WhatsApp on the newly created account and use it for your second number. Use Different Skin Tone Emojis Some WhatsApp emojis such as hand and face gestures (not the smileys) can also be sent in different skin tones. The skin tones vary from light to dark, which gives you a personal feel to it. To change the skin tone of the emojis, click on emojis, long tap on the emoji you want to send and you will see a list of the same emoji with different skin tones to choose from. Send Messages To Multiple Contacts WhatsApp brought the Broadcasting of the messages to the table. Through this, users can draft one message and forward it to multiple contacts without having to copy paste in individual chats. For this, you need to tap Option, select New Broadcast, tap on the Plus Sign (+) to add contacts, tap Done and then tap on Create. There is no limit on the contact list, so feel free to select as many as you like. Edit Images Before Sending One of the latest updates brought a Snapchat-like feature to WhatsApp. This feature had been missing and has now made WhatsApp a more complete messenger applications. Normally when you take photos, you almost always want to edit them before sending. You can now do that with WhatsApp. After taking a picture through in-app camera, you can now add emojis, crop the the image taken or write anything on the picture using the pen option. The usability of the feature is extremely straightforward. Are you aware of any more of the tips and tricks regarding WhatsApp?

SUBSCRIBE Responsive ads for the Google Display Network: 6 months in As of January 31, AdWords advertisers will no longer be able to create or edit standard text ads for the Display Network, and Google is encouraging the adoption of responsive ads instead. Columnist Anna Shirley explains this new ad format and shares some results from her company's initial testing. Anna Shirley on January 11, 2017 at 11:45 am More At the Google Performance Summit in May 2016, Google announced responsive ads for display, which subsequently rolled out to advertiser accounts in July. Since we’ve been able to use responsive ads for six months now, I’ve included some of the most commonly asked questions below to cover some of the advantages, disadvantages and results seen to date. I’ll also look at what’s up next for responsive ads and how you can best use these across your AdWords campaigns. So, first things first. What are responsive ads? To be honest, responsive ads do what they say on the tin. These display ads adjust automatically to fit into available ad space across the Google Display Network (GDN). The size, appearance and format of the ad will be tailored to match the look and feel of the web page, your targeting and the campaign goals that you have set up. In theory, this should mean a more natural and visually pleasing ad experience for the user (I’m sure we’ve all seen our fair share of ugly GDN ads in our time!) and better campaign performance for the advertiser. A win-win situation! What are the key benefits of this new format? The “one size fits all” approach should save advertisers time and money, as they no longer need to make multiple variations of the same ad in different sizes (200 x 200, 120 x 600 and 300 x 50, for example). To set up responsive ads, you need to upload assets within the AdWords interface including a business name, logo, an image, a short headline (max. 25 characters), a longer headline (max. 90 characters), a description and a final URL. You also have the option of selecting advanced options like custom URL parameters if you so wish. Google will optimize the creative assets based on past performance — so as the ads gain more data, you should see incremental improvements in performance. When responsive ads are displayed in a “native” format, they will be eligible to appear on the native inventory that is now available on the GDN. Ads will be able to adjust to the type of device used. With the rise of ad inventory available on mobile and tablet devices, this will give advertisers more freedom to appear across these placements and to ensure their ads are shown, harmonizing with screen size and page content. Hang on. Surely there must be some disadvantages? If you are a fan of ad testing (and let’s face it, who isn’t?), you may not be happy with the options available for responsive ads. Previously, you could split out performance by text and image ads and look at metrics for each ad size individually. This allowed you to adjust bids for ad formats or optimize your best-performing ad sizes. Now, this will no longer be possible. Make sure you remember that not all uploaded creative assets will appear when ads are displayed. For example, your ad could be displayed without the description or within the image, if Google believes that this will improve the ad performance on a given web page. Technically speaking, you will still be able to test different ads by uploading different creative assets, but you will not be able to know with any degree of certainty exactly which format, size or image were shown at any one time. How are they performing so far? At Merkle | Periscopix (my employer), we’ve been pleased with results seen to date. For one client within the Property sector, when split-testing between the old and new ad formats, we saw an amazing 10 percent increase in click-through rate. 59 percent increase in conversion rate. 19 percent decrease in cost-per-acquisition. One thing to note is that we initially saw poor performance from responsive ads when we compared to standard ads and found ourselves quite disappointed. On average, we found that we needed to run the new ad sets for around two to three weeks before they started to outperform the old ones, allowing us to transition to running responsive ads only. As I mentioned earlier, Google will optimize responsive ads based on historic data; so you will need to allow their algorithm to build up performance knowledge, which is why we saw them take a few weeks to gain traction. This is why we run standard and responsive ads in tandem for a few weeks before switching over completely to responsive. For this reason, we have found that a phased transition works best, following the steps outlined below. By following these steps, we have managed to avoid any large fluctuations in traffic or conversion volume. What’s next for responsive ads? Google have confirmed that as of January 31, 2017, advertisers will no longer be able to create new standard text ads or edit existing ones. For this reason, I would urge you to get testing this new feature ASAP to ensure you’re not left behind after the final cutoff date. For those running Dynamic Remarketing campaigns, don’t worry, Google hasn’t forgotten about you! This feature is still in beta but should be available across your AdWords accounts. The principles are exactly the same as the normal responsive ads, but the images displayed with be taken from the feed and will vary depending on what the user has previously looked at on your website. At some point in 2017, Google will also be rolling out responsive ads for Gmail Ads campaigns, allowing us much greater flexibility across these campaigns, too. Rather than setting up separate ads for each of the different templates available (or just sticking to one template type) like single image ads or a catalogue-style ad, you will be able to upload multiple assets, and Google will combine them into a variety of ad sizes and formats. Although again, the downside is that it takes away some of the creativity and testing ability from the advertiser. However, it will also make it much easier to set up and launch these campaigns in the future. We’re also getting wind of some responsive ad testing and updates and would expect this to continue throughout Q1 2017, with new features cropping up as they begin to refine the assets needed. A few parting words… In summary, it looks like Google has recognized the need to make Display (Display, Remarketing, Dynamic Remarketing and Gmail Ads) campaign setup easier for advertisers, as well as the underlying need to have ads that match the look and feel of the web page on which they are displayed, ensuring a positive and beneficial ad experience for the user. When weighing up the pros and cons, I’m positive that these changes will benefit our various Display campaigns in the long run, improving both campaign performance metrics, brand positioning and finally, the user experience for those viewing the ads across the GDN. The only negative for me is the limitation this now places on creative testing, but we can only hope that Google may listen to our requests here and launch something to help us out a little.

By Mary-Ann Russon January 11, 2017 17:19 GMT Fark's founder is criticising Google for the way it handles its AdSense service, after Fark lost revenue due to a Google algorithm glitchReuters The founder of the popular link-sharing website Fark is publicly criticising Google for the way it deals with websites that carry Google advertisements, after a mistake led to Fark losing five months' of advertising revenue from its AdSense service. Drew Curtis, the founder of Fark, says that in October 2015, Google suspended ads on the website after the AdSense algorithm mistakenly identified an image from a Fark forum thread dating back to 2010 about a man who was acquitted for possessing underage pornographic material in the US. The Fark forum thread in question featured a fully-clothed image of the actress that starred in the porn film, as well as a link to the court case story on ABC.co.au, which explained that – although the actress on the pirated DVD cover looked like she was underage – she was in fact 19 years old when it was made. The article went on the mention that the actress, from Venezuela, flew to the US and testified in person that she was of legal age when the film was made, and the man was cleared of all charges. Although the image and the thread about the story had been live on the Fark website for five years, for some reason Google's algorithm detected the image in October 2015 and decided it was inappropriate, because the image of the woman included a tiny logo of 'Pedobear' in the corner – a cartoon meme meant to signify paedophilia. "We took down the image in question and pointed all this out to Google Policy, who took another week to respond that the problem actually was there was a small pedo bear logo in the lower left corner. This is total bullsh*t. They specifically accused me of having committed a felony. The presence of that logo would not have triggered a felony charge. They screwed up and were scrambling to cover their butts," Curtis wrote in the latest Fark newsletter. Google refusing to reinburse over algorithm's mistake "What's insane about this is Google ostensibly makes all of their money from advertising, yet for some reason has customer service worse than any cable company ever dared deploy. Google's Policy team lets an algorithm shut ads off on media companies without warning and without human review – because no actual human being would have ever approved this decision. "It is literally impossible to contact Google Policy without going through an intermediary. And even intermediaries have immense difficulty contacting Google Policy. First contact with Google Policy took two full weeks." Curtis goes onto say that even though Google reinstated the ads after five weeks, it is refusing to reimburse Fark for the money it lost during that period, even though it is satisfied that Fark didn't do anything wrong in the first place. He also says a similar incident occurred in 2013 when Google shut off its ads over an image that it said contained "too much sideboob". Google was never able to explain what exactly it meant by that pronouncement, and in the end reimbursed Fark for its lost revenue. "In talking with other media companies, I've discovered that my experience is unfortunately not an uncommon one. Many other sites I've talked to have had this same thing happen to them – some have even gone under as a result. They're afraid of being blacklisted by Google so they don't talk about it publicly," said Curtis. "I'm not afraid. I'm pretty sure Google corporate has no idea Google Policy operates with such a high level of incompetence. They need to know." Curtis is now calling on users of the link aggregation site to consider supporting it with monthly paid subscriptions because this time, no reimbursement is forthcoming, and Fark is concerned that it may not be able to continue functioning and paying its staff if things do not improve in the near future. A Google spokesperson told IBTimes UK: "We constantly review publishers for compliance with our AdSense policies and take action in the event of violations. If publishers want to appeal or learn more about actions taken with respect to their account, they can find information at the help centre here."

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Can my phone be tracked? Chris Burns - Jan 11, 2017 1 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Absolutely yes, your smartphone can be tracked – the question we should be asking is: what can we do about it? Today we’re going to run down several easy ways in which we can see our phone being tracked, first of all. Then we’re going to shut down this tracking in a few easy steps. It’s really not too big of a hassle, just a trade-off – location tracking lets us map where we’re going, but in exchange, our phone has to know where we are. The first and most easily accessible place everyone can check to see how and when they’re being tracked – with an Android phone, anyway – is through Google Timeline. If you’re not fearful of Google seeing where you’ve been, Google Timeline is a fairly awesome tool to manage your real-life map of pins for places you’ve visited. Tap on a year and find a Suitcase icon on the map and you’ll find a timeline for a trip – including stops along the way, photos you took, and exact coordinates for places you stopped. NOTE: iOS has a map history like this as well – it’s just not as readily available.* To disable location tracking on an Android device, all one needs to do is follow these simple steps: 1. Open Settings. 2. Find Location and tap. 3. Scroll to Google Location Settings. 4. Switch Location Reporting and Location History off. That’s it – unless the user also wants to delete location history on Android. Note that this process will not necessarily delete all location history Google has on file for each user – this just affects the phone being used. 1. Open Settings. 2. Find Location and tap. 3. Scroll to Google Location Settings. 4. Find Location History and tap “Delete Location History” To disable Location Services on iOS (on an iPhone or iPad), the user must follow the steps listed here: 1. Open Settings. 2. Scroll to Privacy and tap Location Services. 3. Switch Location Services off – all at once, or for individual apps. 4. For future control, select System Services and disable additional location data. In order to delete location history on iOS (for iPad or iPhone), the user must enter the Maps app and clear recents. 1. Open Maps. 2. Tab the Search box. 3. Tap Favorites. 4. Tap Recents. 5. Tap Clear (upper left corner). 6. Tap Clear All Recents. * A similar mapping history can be found for Apple’s iOS devices by opening Settings – Privacy – Location Services – System Services – Frequent Locations. This is another place Apple users will want to go to delete their location history – perhaps more important than the Maps Favorites bit above. Once an iOS user gets to the Frequent Locations screen, all they’ll have to do to delete it is tap “Clear History” – easy enough!

Image Credit: Jordan Novet/VentureBeat Google today is announcing the launch of a Key Management Service for its Google Cloud Platform (GCP) portfolio of public cloud services. The tool, which is available now in beta, offers developers a cloud-hosted system for dealing with and monitoring encryption keys. While it’s integrated with some of Google’s existing Cloud Platform services, such as Identity Access Management, it can also be used to handle encryption keys for non-Google systems. This is in addition to the existing option to bring your own encryption keys, which Google introduced in 2015. “As an alternative to custom-built or ad-hoc key management systems, which are difficult to scale and maintain, Cloud KMS makes it easy to keep your keys safe,” Google product manager Maya Kaczorowski wrote in a blog post. The launch comes more than two years after public cloud market leader Amazon Web Services (AWS) introduced its Key Management Service. Cloud storage software company Box subsequently introduced a key management service built on top of it. Public cloud infrastructure providers Microsoft and IBM (through Bluemix) have also launched cloud-based key management services. The Google tool offers a companion application programming interface (API), which lets developers programmatically create, use, rotate, and destroy keys, Kaczorowski wrote. While Google competes on features, it also challenges other clouds when it comes to pricing and geographical availability. Google is active in both of those areas. In March, Google committed to opening 12 new regions of data centers for operating cloud infrastructure. ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat.

Voice hasn't received much attention in the past couple of years but Google is now hinting at a major relaunch coming soon. Nothing has been unveiled yet but multiple Google Voice users are seeing upgrade announcements being displayed in the app's online interface. Banners stating "The new Google Voice is here" with a "Try Now" link are appearing at the top of the page. Clicking the link simply refreshes the current view. Google Voice hasn't been updated in over a year. Its last release on the iPhone was in June 2016, although that was only a simple bug fixing update. Before that, feature updates were delivered in October 2015. The only change on iOS was support for the new iPhone 6 and 6 Plus display resolutions. Voice's Android client is limited and significantly outdated. The app has effectively been in extended support mode, barely touched by Google. Despite the lack of attention, Voice remains popular with users. Its standout feature, the ability for users to share phone numbers and ring them from anywhere, remains fairly unique. Newer apps from startup firms are starting to offer this capability though, further emphasising Voice's dwindling value. Google may be seeking to change this with an overhaul of the service. By modernising it, introducing a new interface and expanding on its features, it could reaffirm its presence in the voice calling space. After the upgrade banners began displaying to users, the company confirmed it is working on an update to be unveiled "as soon as we can." "Sorry, it looks like we must have dialed the wrong number! But don’t worry, this wasn't a prank call," a Google spokesperson said to The Verge. "We're working on some updates to Google Voice right now. We have you on speed dial and we'll be sure to share what we've been up to just as soon as we can." Google Voice is now just one of many communication apps owned by Google. The company has been backing away from its classic apps, pushing customers towards its newer, far less popular chat clients. Google has been heavily promoting its new Allo and Duo apps, services that have been criticised by fans of the outgoing Hangouts and Voice for being too light on features and lacking in cross-platform support. The new Voice will be part of a fragmented array of Google messaging services, making it doubly important it appeals to existing fans. Google's strategy may be confusing but it looks as though Voice will play a role going forward. With the company refusing to give any more details ahead of the launch, users will need to keep hoping that patience has finally paid off.

Google’s Cloud Platform gets a new key management service Posted Jan 11, 2017 by Frederic Lardinois (@fredericl) 0 SHARES Next Story GigRove wants to match skilled freelancers and startups with spare rooms Google is launching a new key management service for its Cloud Platform today that will help enterprises — especially in regulated industries like healthcare and banking — create, use, rotate and destroy their encryption keys in the cloud. The aptly named Google Cloud Key Management Service (Cloud KMS) is now available as a beta in select countries. Enterprises have traditionally managed their keys on-premise, but as they have slowly moved more of their workloads to the cloud, they have also started thinking about how they can manage their keys in the cloud, too. With the AWS Key Management Service and Azure Key Vault, Amazon and Microsoft have long offered a similar tool, for example, and even Google itself already offered a more basic version of Cloud KMS for users who wanted to supply their own encryption keys. As Google’s Maya Kaczorowski, the product manager for this service, told me, it’s worth remembering that Google itself already encrypts all of the data on its platform by default. But if an enterprise needs more control over its keys to rotate and manage them, the Cloud KMS service is for them. It’s worth noting that Cloud KMS users can use the service to securely store other secrets like OAuth tokens or configuration credentials on the service, as well. Google tells me that fraud detection provider Ravelin, for example, uses the service to store its users’ configuration and authentication credentials that are needed as part of virtually every transaction on its service in Cloud KMS. As Kaczorowski stressed, this also means that the company is able to keep the latency of these transactions low. “We want to be able to be in the serving path of our customers,” she said. “We want to enable people to encrypt things they weren’t able to before.” With the addition of Cloud KMS, Kaczorowski argued, Google now offers its users the full continuum of key management options — ranging from customer-supplied keys that are kept on-premise and used to secure cloud assets on one side and the default Cloud Platform encryption on the other, with the flexibility of the new Cloud KMS service in the middle. Kaczorowski tells me that the service can easily handle hundreds of millions of keys and secrets, so scaling should not be an issue. “From the get-go, we architected it to allow customers to use as many keys as they want to,” she said. Google will bill users based on the number of keys they store ($0.06 per active key version per month) and how often they use them ($0.03 per key use per 10,000 operations). Like most of Google’s latest Cloud Platform updates, today’s launch is also clearly aimed at getting more enterprises to take a serious look at Google’s Cloud Platform. For the longest time, Google didn’t really go after these companies, but the company is now putting a renewed emphasis on competing in the enterprise cloud business.

Google reportedly selling off its satellite imaging division - Irish Sun Issue 016/15 Irish Sun        http://www.irishsun.com   Ireland News Breaking International News Breaking Business News Europe Sports News Dublin News Economics News Belfast News Breaking Internet News Web Site Development News Healthcare News Ireland News Utilities News Google reportedly selling off its satellite imaging division PanArmenian.Net Thursday 12th January, 2017 PanARMENIAN.Net - Alphabet Inc. is in talks to sell the Skybox Imaging satellite business it acquired for $500 million less than three years ago, another sign the technology giant is ratcheting back grand ambitions to blanket the globe with internet service, Bloomberg reveals. Planet, a satellite imaging startup former known as Planet Labs, may acquire Skybox, according to people familiar with the situation. Some employees from the Alphabet division, renamed Terra Bella last year, would move to Planet as part of the deal, while others may get different positions at Google, according to these people. They asked not to be identified because the transaction is private. Representatives from Planet and Alphabet's Google unit declined to comment. The move signals an ambitious agenda for Planet, which has raised more than $150 million. In contrast, Google parent Alphabet has been curbing once-audacious plans to blanket the globe with internet access, partly through networks of small satellites. In October, the company cut about 9 percent of staff from its Fiber fast internet service. In June 2014, when Google acquired Skybox, the search giant said its equipment would help keep Google Maps accurate with up-to-date imagery. It also hoped to use the technology to improve internet access and disaster relief. The division operated within Google's mapping business and it launched a small number of satellites, each about the size of a refrigerator. Alphabet seems to be switching from a strategy of developing its own satellite businesses to investing in other companies pursuing similar goals. The Skybox sale to Planet is an equity transaction, which means Alphabet will own a stake in the latter startup, according to some of the people familiar with the situation. In 2013, Google hired satellite industry pioneer Greg Wyler to work on a $1 billion-plus project for the internet giant, but Wyler left in September 2014 to start his own company, OneWeb. Soon after, Google bought a stake in Elon Musk's SpaceX, which launches a lot of satellites.

Featured Story U2 tickets selling for whopping 900 euros each DUBLIN, Ireland - With epic rock band, U2 set to perform at a concert in Croke Park in July this year - a flurry of activity has been witnessed around ticket sales already.  Tickets are set to go on sale officially from tomorrow - however, a day before the official sales begin, tickets to watch the band perform live are already being sold and for nothing less than a whopping 900 euros each.  According to reports, fans that subscribed to the band’s official website were granted access to a pre-sale ticket portal last week and industry sources revealed that diehard fans with access to these tickets have chosen to sell them for a profit.  A set of tickets are said to have become available on official and black market websites since last week.  Tickets available currently on websites like Seatwave and Viagogo are being sold at prices higher than face value.  Officially, tickets for the Lower Davin Stand and pitch area of Croke Park have been priced at 76 euros, along with an extra charge of 3.30 euros for agent fees. Meanwhile, those in other parts of the Cusack and Hogan stands carry a value between 110 euros to 186 euros. But on these websites, the prices have been jacked up.   As of Sunday night, Seatwave, that is run by Ticketmaster, had advertised for 650 tickets that were available for sale.  Reports pointed ut that a pair of tickets was sold at 2,070 euros over the weekend and was for the standing section. It included extra charges and was priced at 13 times above face value.  A spokesperson for Ticketmaster defended the sale in a statement that said that Seatwave prices were set by the person selling the tickets and not the company. The spokesperson said, “The thing about Seatwave is that it is a safe and secure market so tickets would be genuine. The ticket prices are set by the seller, which in this instance is not Ticketmaster, but that price may not necessarily be secured by the seller. Ticketmaster is just facilitating the sale."

Google Maps’ Foursquare-like lists feature is getting closer to launch Posted Jan 11, 2017 by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story FarmLogs raises $22 million to make agriculture a more predictable business A feature that will allow Google Maps users to make lists of places is getting closer to public launch. A number of Google Maps users this month have uncovered a new addition to their Google Maps mobile application — a way to make lists of starred and favorite places, as well as create buckets lists of those places they want to visit, and a means to build out their own custom lists. The feature, which is reminiscent of Foursquare’s own list-making tools, has been in testing for months with the Google Local Guides program — a program that rewards users for their contributions to the Maps community with early access to new features. It was first reported this summer as being available to those Local Guides who had achieved a Level 4 or higher and were using Android devices. This week, however, Google emailed its Local Guides to let them know the feature was available on both iOS and Android to those who had attained a Level 2 or higher. (These levels are awarded based on members’ participation and contributions to Maps, by adding things like business reviews and photos, among other things.) A number of Google Maps users have spotted the lists tool showing up in their own Maps mobile application, ahead of its public launch. Some of these users are Level 2 Local Guides, however, which explains why they’re seeing the lists option appear: @googlemaps Loving the new starred locations with the option to add them to lists. However on desktop & mobile it's not a feature yet?! pic.twitter.com/txIi2wbhCx — William ✈ (@mrwjwa) January 6, 2017 @googlemaps finally introduced lists. Thank you. pic.twitter.com/Gxz0TKzpdX — Jay (@jairus_james) January 6, 2017 Woah: @googlemaps just added lists. Looks kinda like @Foursquare pic.twitter.com/SDAGr5oJwu — andrew furman (@furman) January 6, 2017 My Google Maps iOS app has grown the ability to save places to lists instead of just starring them pic.twitter.com/6KQeKBqcu8 — Simon Willison (@simonw) January 8, 2017 There is perhaps some crossover between the lists feature and Google’s newer travel planning app, Google Trips, which helps you create lists of “Saved Places” — meaning those you want to visit at your destination. However, the Maps list-making tool is broader in scope, allowing you to keep track of any place you want to remember, whether that’s your favorite local restaurants or places you want to go at some point in the future. That puts it in more direct competition with Foursquare’s app, as well as those from smaller startups, like Soon.  If you have access to this feature, you’ll find it under the Menu option, in the “Saved” tab of the “Your Places” section. We’ve asked Google for a comment on the status of the public launch, but the company declined to provide details beyond saying that it’s “always experimenting with new features in Google Maps” and the decision to launch to all will be determined by user feedback.

The latest look inside the APK seems to turn up a few interesting changes. For starters, Google seems to be exploring an expansion on sorting options for the My Apps view. It looks like you’ll be able to sort apps by alphabetical order, when they were last updated, when they were last used, and even size. This should make it worlds easier to find what you’re looking for in a jiffy. Another interesting hint points to family purchase authorizations that can be done remotely. Currently, an authorization has to take place on the device where the original purchase was attempted, but the update would seemingly allow the head of the family to approve or deny requests on their own devices. It sounds like it has the potential to make life much easier for those who rely on it. As with all changes associated with preparation, we don’t know when the actual goods are set to arrive. Could be days, weeks, and even months from now — we wouldn’t put anything past Google’s wildly varied update schedule. We’ll be on the lookout for it, though, so stay tuned. local_offer    Google   Google Play   Google Play Store   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (2) stars Further Reading Google's new CDD rules New update to Gboard fixes a lot of issues with laggy actions Pixel's Google Assistant gets screenshot button Nexus 6 suffers speakerphone issue Tango museum enhancements launched in Detroit stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertLatest OxygenOS update comes to the OnePlus 3T closeOnePlus pushes the latest OxygenOS Nougat update to the OnePlus 3 and 3T After users were discovered to be unable to download apps from the Play Store, OnePlus released a bug fix update for the OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T. 2 more_vertGalaxy S8 to have IP68 rating closeSamsung Galaxy S8 is expected to feature IP68 water resistance The Samsung Galaxy S8 is rumored to have IP68 water resistance.

Here are three recent technology books that jumped out and made me read them.  Throwing Rocks  Douglas Rushkoff was one of the first writers to try to understand digital culture, starting with Cyberia in 1994 and followed up by Media Virus in 1995. He is credited with originating ideas that are part of our vocabulary now, like viral media, digital native and social currency.  Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus takes its title from an incident in which protesters shattered windows on one of the buses ferrying employees from downtown San Francisco to Google’s suburban campus. According to Rushkoff, the conflict that really matters—the one that drives so many other problems—is not between residents and the employees whose presence was inflating housing costs, or the 99 percent vs. the 1 percent or the unemployed against Wall Street.  The core problem, he writes, is that “Growth is the single, uncontested, core command of the digital economy.”  He details how the tech tools and innovative business practices of the new economy support that single command, centralizing economic power in new corporate giants like Google, Apple and Amazon, then outlines an idealistic vision of how the same tools could be redeployed to create a distributive economy, serving human, not corporate needs.  Disrupt This! A Chattanooga start-up founder turned me on to Disrupted: My Misadventure in the Start-Up Bubble, the hysterically-but-painfully funny chronicle of an out-of-work print journalist who went from covering Silicon Valley to trying to reinvent himself as a marketer at a trendy startup. After losing his job at age 50 as Newsweek’s technology editor, Dan Lyons spent a year and a half at Hubspot, surrounded by vast amounts of self-aggrandizing hype and 20-somethings who thought he was really old.  “The happy!! awesome!! rhetoric masks the fact that beneath the covers, there is chaos,” he writes. Turns out that a journalist’s analytic skills and finely tuned B.S. detector didn’t mesh well with all the Kool-Aid being handed out about how building online marketing tools was a great way to change the world.  No matter how awkward the culture clashes got, though, it was after he left and announced he was writing a funny book about his experiences at Hubspot that things took a really dark turn and the FBI got involved.  Technology or Art? Magic and Loss: The Internet as Art, by Virginia Heffernan, is a kaleidoscopic figure-ground exercise, like those pictures that are either a chalice or two faces looking at each other, or a young girl or an old woman, but never both.  When we talk about technology, are we looking at culture or tech? Of course it’s both, but even when you know that, it’s hard to see both at once. Heffernan is a digital native. Growing up in a college town, she hacked into Dartmouth University’s connection to ARPANET, which predated the Internet. “By the time I turned thirteen, I was confident I knew every single person online,” she deadpans. In chapters on the building blocks of the Internet—design, text, images, video, music—she alternatively riffs and goes deep, playing over the entire history of the Internet, from its precursor networks and early games to apps and social media. She “reads” the Internet as an aesthetic experience, as a single game that is also one artwork. She attacks technology head on and cuts right through it to the culture at its heart. But since it’s a magical sword, both tech and art somehow remain intact. Maybe this is a three-book Rorschach test and everyone sees their own meaning, but here’s what I see: there was a palpable sense that anything was possible with the early Internet.  Then came the centralized, commercialized web serving the old, unchallenged goal of endless growth and accompanied not just by hype, which was there from the beginning, but also stunning amounts of self-deception.  The transformative possibilities of technology still exist, waiting to be realized.

Apple was trailed by Facebook and Google, which, with scores of 67 and 56 per cent respectively, were also awarded A grades. But the report’s authors looked less favourably upon Amazon and Netflix, whose progress was described as “lagging”. Noah Berger / Reuters The Apple Campus 2 is seen under construction in Cupertino, California. The campus is set to be powered by renewable energy sources.  Apple scored As for energy transparency, renewable energy commitment and sitting policy, energy efficiency and mitigation and energy procurement. It only fell down in one category – advocacy, for which it scored a B. Apple, Facebook and Google are racing to become the first tech companies to be 100% renewably powered.  Apple hit 93% in 2015, but has not yet set a date for when it will be fully powered by renewables. It could be overtaken by Google this year, which has plans to buy enough wind and solar energy to offset all its electricity usage in 2017. Netflix also has plans to fully offset its carbon footprint, but Greenpeace said it is “likely” turning to carbon offsets or unbundled renewable energy credits, which “do little to increase renewable energy investment”. The firm accounts for one third of internet traffic in North America. Meanwhile, Amazon’s clean energy index rating fell after the firm grew its data centre capacity in Virginia, where Greenpeace said there are few renewable energy options.  “Given [Amazon Web Service’s] continued lack of transparency and its rapid growth in Virginia and other markets largely served by dirty energy, it remains unclear whether the AWS cloud is actually on a path to becoming renewably powered,” the report said.  Greenpeace is calling on firms to make a number of pledges, including to hit 100 per cent renewable power, to greater energy transparency and to develop a strategy for increasing the supply of renewable energy. The report’s authors stressed that tech firms have the power to influence others in the industry. Apple was described as playing a “catalytic role within its IT supply chain, pushing other IT data centers and cloud operators who help deliver pieces of Apple’s corner of the internet to follow their lead in powering their operations with renewable energy”.  HuffPost UK has approached Netflix and Amazon for comment.  Update: An Amazon spokesperson told HuffPost UK: “In November 2014 AWS made a long-term commitment to achieve 100 percent renewable energy and in just two years we’ve made strong progress towards that goal. By April 2015 we hit 25 percent renewable, closed 2016 at 45 percent renewable, and have set a goal to reach 50 percent by the end of 2017. “AWS has to date enabled 10 renewable energy projects in the United States that will deliver a grand total of 2.6 million MWh of energy annually onto the electric grid powering AWS data centers and four of these projects are already online. That said, we are nowhere near done. We will continue to make progress toward our 100 percent goal and have many exciting initiatives planned.” More: Apple Amazon Uk Apple Greenpeace Uk Amazon Suggest a correction Advertisement Suggested For You by Gravity Comments Advertisement Suggested For You Close SUBSCRIBE TO & FOLLOW UK TECH Learn more Newsletter 127 K 16.9 K 21.5 K Podcast Add us on Snapchat Advertisement Why Apple Is Leading The Race To Build A Green Internet CONVERSATIONS Advertise RSS Careers FAQ User Agreement Privacy Comment Policy About Us About Our Ads Contact Us Archive "The Huffington Post UK" is provided by AOL (UK) Limited. © 2017 AOL (UK) Limited its affiliates and licensors.

VR Headsets VR QR Codes News / VR & AR 0  Print This Post   •    Email This Post   •   Report: 98% of VR headsets sold this year are for mobile phones by Maria Korolov · November 30, 2016 Although high-end sets like the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and the PlayStation VR get more attention, the vast majority of the virtual reality headsets sold this year are projected to be the lower-cost mobile-based headsets. In fact, the three main mobile VR headset types — Google Cardboard, Google Daydream, and Samsung Gear VR — will account of 98 percent of the nearly 89 million headsets sold this year, according to data provided today to Hypergrid Business by SuperData Research. Millions of headsets expected to be sold in 2016. (Data by SuperData Research.) Google Cardboard headsets outsell all the others combined more than 20 times over. Cardboard doesn’t get much respect because many people associate it with the early prototypes that Google released that were, in fact, made out of cardboard, or with the give-aways distributed as promotional items by New York Times and other companies. But there are many other headsets that are compatible with this standard, including the Mattel View-Master VR and Merge VR. More than 100 manufacturers have released their own versions, some priced at $10 or less. You can see my list of the best low-cost headsets here. Google Cardboard is not the best platform for high-end games or complex, interactive applications, but it works well for very simple VR games and 360-degree videos. And the headsets are compatible with almost any late-model smartphone, both iPhones and Androids. The low price of the individual headsets, and compatibility with most phones, makes them the preferred option for marketing giveaways. But there’s a down side to that, as well. “Shipments and sales do not necessarily translate to usage,” Llamas said. “The largest consumers are not individuals but companies promoting their products — like the New York Times.” It can be hard to see the numbers for any of the other headsets in the above chart, so here’s the same chart without Google Cardboard: Millions of headsets expected to be sold in 2016. (Data by SuperData Research.) Here are the numbers for how many headsets are expected to be sold this year, according to Stephanie Llamas, SuperData’s director of research and insights: Google Cardboard: 84,400,000 Samsung Gear VR: 2,316,632 PlayStation VR: 745,434 HTC Vive: 450,083 Oculus Rift: 355,088 Google Daydream: 261,083 “Headset sales have not seen a large boost from Black Friday and Cyber Monday despite holiday deals,” Llamas told Hypergrid Business. “Most early adopters have bought in already.” And for the two high-end headsets in particular, gift-giving is problematic, since it can be hard for the givers to tell whether the headset will work with the recipient’s computer, and to navigate the other technical details of selecting a headset. “Mobile devices still have the best opportunity in this market,” Llamas said. Just some of the Google Cardboard-compatible headsets on the market today. Meanwhile, the PlayStation VR is not getting as much of a marketing push as it could have. PlayStation VR sales projection cut from 2.6 million to 0.7 million In fact, the PlayStation VR numbers released today are a dramatic change from back in March, when SuperData predicted that 2.6 million PlayStation VR headsets will be sold this year. Stephanie Llamas “Sony has taken a more prudent approach and held off on spending frivolously on marketing the PlayStation VR to better position the PlayStation Pro,” said Llamas. “Sony is making just enough units available to prove the case for virtual reality, without seeking to fully saturate the market and, instead, build the offering more gradually to ensure a stronger life-cycle. They have also pointed out that VR looks even better on a Pro than a standard or slim PlayStation 4, so the message to most gamers is: Get the Pro now, then the PSVR later.” As a result, PlayStation VR won’t cross the 1 million sales mark until well into next year, she said. “Had Sony pushed the PSVR the way they’ve been pushing their other new hardware, the demand would have certainly fulfilled a supply of over 2 million,” she added. “They can afford to take it slow since they have no competition for now, so their supply and sales will rise steadily into 2017 as opposed to riding the seasonal wave.” Oculus Rift sales have suffered because of the hardware release strategy — the motion controllers are only coming out in December, months after the headset itself was released. Developers had to decide whether they were going to make games that worked with the new controllers, or without them. “This means development has slowed and is becoming another barrier to growth,” she said. And the recent promotion, where buyers got a $100 Oculus credit instead of just getting $100 off, didn’t help. HTC Vive simply gave customers a $100 discount, a smarter decision, Llamas said. “This makes it an easier gift to buy, but it’s still a big investment for a technology largely unknown to the general consumer,” she said. In other news today, SuperData announced that it is partnering with the world’s top virtual reality developers and headset manufacturers to form the VR Data Network. The goal is to bring all the players together to collaborate on getting solid metrics about the scope and trajectory of the market, track sales and performance, and get insights on customer sentiment and behaviors. Julien Dulioust “The VR industry is changing extremely rapidly, so it’s more important than ever to have reliable, accurate data we can use to make decisions,” Julien Dulioust, senior monetization director at CCP Games, said in a statement. “It’s hard enough predicting where the market will be in six months, but we need to look 12, 18, 24 months into the future, so working with SuperData is extremely important to us.”   Related Posts OpenSim year in review Genesis Metaverse switches to DigiWorldz hosting How I use CoSpaces to help students create their dreams OpenSim Embassy celebrates grand opening Wednesday Canadian Sun to hold St. Patrick’s Day parade Tags: Google CardboardGoogle DaydreamHTC ViveOculus RiftPlayStation VRSamsung Gear VRSuperData Research Maria Korolov Maria Korolov is editor and publisher of Hypergrid Business.

VR Headsets VR QR Codes Maria's Worlds / VR & AR Creating a Cardboard QR code by Maria Korolov · November 7, 2015 I recently ordered Baofeng Small Mojing virtual reality headset from AliExpress. They start at $12, with free shipping, and come in a variety of colors. I got the pink ones. Baofeng Small Mojing in pink and purple.   Unfortunately, they did not come with a Google Cardboard QR code. This is a symbol that you use to calibrate your headset, so that Google Cardboard virtual reality apps and YouTube movies show up as best as possible. Google, unfortunately, was not my friend — apparently, this particular QR code had not yet been uploaded by anyone. But I’m not someone who’s just willing to sit around and wait for other people to do the work. Especially when I can get a blog post out of it. And there’s a QR Code Generator that Google has created for folks to use. Of course, this generator is designed to be used by the manufacturers themselves, but it turned out that it wasn’t too difficult for a mere human to do it, either. Getting started with the Viewer Profile Generator. I loaded up the official website on my computer, then picked up my smartphone — a Samsung Galaxy S6, pulled up a QR code reader app, and scanned the QR code. Or you could also type in the URL provided. It opened up a tool on my smartphone that is synched with the form on my computer screen. The phone loaded the tool and asked me for the “pixels per inch” value of my device. I Googled “samsung galaxy s6 pixels per inch” and got 577. Easy enough. It asked me to touch the screen to switch to full-screen view, then I got a bunch of lines on the screen. Viewer calibration screen. Now, back to the website on my computer. I skipped the part about adding my company name and device name, since I’m not the actual manufacturer — and I still have hopes that the manufacturer themselves will come through and create an official code.   Google’s Viewer Profile Generator for Google Cardboard-compatible headsets. So, first, it asked me for the primary button type. This headset doesn’t have any buttons — but it does allow me to touch the screen. That’s probably as good as having a touch-style button on the headset itself, so I selected “touch.” Then it asked me for the screen-to-lens distance. I’m supposed to use calipers to measure this. Measuring the distance between the viewer’s lenses and the smartphone screen. (Image courtesy Google.) I don’t own a pair of calipers, but I do have measuring tape. I got 55 millimeters. Then they had me measure the distance from the center of one lens to the center of the other. That came out to 65 millimeters. My lenses were adjustable, so, per their instructions, I set them at the middle setting for this measurement. Then they asked me how the phone is aligned. Some headsets — like the FireFly — have the phone positioned so that it’s centered in all directions. As you can see with this particular set, however, the phone is just dropped in and sits at the bottom of the two clips. So I chose “bottom” for the vertical alignment. Then they had me measure the distance from the bottom of the tray — in my case, the bottom of those clips — to the center of the lenses. That came out to 40 millimeters in this particular case. Now comes the tricky part — the distortion coefficients. This is what adjusts for the curvature of the lenses. Here is where the magic happens. Since the online form is synched to the tool running on the smartphone, you can adjust the coefficients — using the little up and down arrows — and see the immediate effect on the phone. I adjusted the k1 value up and down and a value of 0.15 seemed to work the best. Then I did the same for k2, and got 0.22. That was it. I clicked the “Generate Profile” button and got my QR code: Baofeng Small Mojing QR Code qr_viewer_profile I added this code to my QR Codes page, for anyone else to use. I’m going to follow the same process and create QR codes for other headsets in my collection that don’t have official QR codes released yet. Do you have a headset that you created a QR code for? Please share! Paste a link below, or email me: [email protected] . Thanks!

White Bunny Thanks Maria! This was quite helpful. gnico Hi Maria, will one be added soon for the Autonomous Teleport VR Headset? I’m unable to find a QR Code for it anywhere. I received it from Indigogo a few days ago and I feel as though its not calibrated for the apps I have. Maria Korolov A reader just asked for a QR Code for the Teleport 3D camera and headset: https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/teleport-save-share-your-best-memories-via-vr#/ I don’t have one, but I see that in the comments, someone has already asked for one. I’ll keep an eye out, and if they post one, I’ll add it to my list (http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/faq/vr-headset-qr-codes/). Maria Korolov The manufacturer got back to me, and I’ve added it to my QR Codes page. And here it is as well: alberto please help me, i m tryng to generate qr code for model zte nubia z7 and i cant:( i dont understand why… on line exist for mini version, that s not same. please help me. Maria Korolov The ZTE Nubia Z7 is a phone, not a headset. A viewer QR code is based on the viewer — how its lenses are configured, mostly. The same QR Code is then used on any smartphone. What headset do you have? Raul B. Thanks for the QR, Maria! I also have a couple of Baofeng Small Mojing, but black and purple instead of pink. I’ve tried your QR on them, but it doesn’t work as expected (maybe mine are from a different batch). I’ve generated QRs adapted to my headsets for two positions of the lenses: “centered” position (62mm) and “near” position (57mm). Maybe you want to add them to your QR collection as alternative QRs for this headset… Maria Korolov Could also be because I have weird eyes! This is why I haven’t been making as many QR codes as I could be — I have a different prescription on each eye. Thanks for the QR Codes! Maria Korolov A reader sent me this image, that may be useful for people calibrating their Cardboard-compatible viewers, which you can download here: http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/download/vr-test-image-file/ It’s a 3D image, so I can’t just attach it here.

Maria Korolov What problems are you getting when you use the FiiT QR Code from our QR Codes page? http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/faq/vr-headset-qr-codes/ Are you able to successfully recognize the QR Code with your Google Cardboard app and switch viewers? Do you have a particular kind of distortion of the image? Nicolas Eshraghi I still have double vision when I use it Maria Korolov Double vision can also be caused by the smartphone not being perfectly centered in the viewer. One thing you can try is moving the smartphone to the right or left a little bit, while looking through the viewer, and seeing if that helps the double vision issue. Another reason is that your eyes could be farther apart or closer together than the headset makers planned for. on the FiiT, you should be able to move the lenses closer or farther apart — does that help? Another possibility is that there’s something about the combination of you, your smartphone, the viewer, and the QR Code that just doesn’t work. Can you try the headset using someone else’s smartphone? Can you have someone else try the viewer? And do all the FiiT QR codes cause the same double-vision effect for you? Here are the QR Codes again. Alvin Hey, can you help me to generate the qr code for gruu vr kit? Thanks Maria Korolov This one here? http://www.unomax.com/gruuvr It’s just a rebranded Ritech Riem II.

Also, I may be getting a Fiit VR 2S to use with non-Oculus VR Apps. How do you use the QR code and how will it affect how the phone works with the Gear VR? Can I go back and forth or do I need to do something with the QR code each time I change headsets? Thanks in advance… Maria Korolov The Gear VR is a separate thing, and talks to the phone via a wired connection. It is totally completely separate from the Google Cardboard ecosystem — uses different apps, different standards, different app store, different sensors, everything. A standard Google Cardboard-type viewer doesn’t have any built-in electronics and can’t talk to the phone, so it can’t tell the phone how the lenses are set up, etc… So the QR Code tells the phone how to adjust the picture so that it looks right in your headset. Here is how to use it: http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/2016/06/how-to-set-up-your-new-mobile-vr-viewer/ Artur Khisamov Flying Tiger shops now sell cheap plastic VR headset (GBP7 in UK) pretty descent for the price.

Thanks! David Babcock – Turner Fenton I have a Hyper Vision Headset, bought from Chapters here in Canada, and cannot find a QR code for it.

If you don’t have a code for this I will make a custom one shortly and post it here, couldn’t find one online myself. Maria Korolov I don’t have a copy of the Goji, which is also sold as the VR Box 360. I have contacted those manufacturers, but haven’t heard back yet from them. Arrun Bawa Hi I got the Kellogs Krave VR system do u have the QR code for it? much appreciated Maria Korolov I haven’t seen the QR Code for it anywhere. What I would do is try some of the other Cardboard QR codes on this page, and see if one works: http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/faq/vr-headset-qr-codes/ Sorry I can’t help you more, but I don’t have a copy of the headset. You can also try to contact the distributor who sent it to you. DuhDUDE I bought a DVV Dynamic Virtual Viewer. Can u make a QR code for it Maria Korolov Sorry, but I don’t have one of those headsets! If I get one, I will. meanwhile, I’m keeping my eye out for a QR Code. Maria Korolov Sorry, I haven’t seen one yet, but I’m keeping my eye out for it. Ray Do you have a QR Code for the Dream Vision VR not the pro one thou the Tzumi Dream Vision one Bradley37 Got a Polaroid Virtual Reality headset. http://www.fizzcreations.com. No qr code. Nothing online I could find. Tried the generator and got a “success !” but no qr code actually showed up. Professor AKIA Anyone Have a VR code for VR Box 2.5?

This page is meant to get new hires, interns, or interested community members up to speed with the right software, configurations, and communication channels to contribute effectively to the release engineering pipeline. Video Introductions Release Engineering as a Force Multiplier by John O'Duinn (former director) about how Mozilla Release Engineering handles our business and how we work to improve each and every day. This crowd-sourced video list contains other videos about various aspects of working at Mozilla, including important information such as how to operate the espresso machine. Development Best Practices Read and keep up to date with: Development Best Practices Read and keep up to date with: http://moz-releng-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ Please fix any issues you find: https://github.com/mozilla/build-relengdocs As someone new to the project, your fresh perspective helps shine a light on missing information or assumptions we take for granted. Single Sign-On (SSO) Many Mozilla services use SSO now, including Gmail, Drive, and ServiceNow. The Single Sign-On homepage has a list of the available services. NOTE: SSO requires that LDAP be setup first. Mail Mozilla mail is handled by Gmail now. You should be added to the release@mozilla.com google group as a new hire/intern. This mailing list is managed by Google groups. Owners of this group will be able to add you. Send a test message to release@m.c to verify that your address has been added/subscribed. Talk to your manager if it is not working. WARNING: release@m.c can contain security-sensitive information. Do not automatically forward your email to a system that is not under Mozilla's control. Mailing lists You'll need to manually subscribe to: release-engineering public mailing list mozilla.dev.planning mozilla.dev.tree-management These are available as newsgroups, google groups, and Mailman lists Mail Filtering With all that new email, you will want to set up some filters in Gmail (https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/filters) to filter some of the higher-volume automated mail into a folder. You may eventually want to handle this information, but on day one hundreds of nagios notifications are not going to be educational. Here is an imperfect set of Gmail filters that you can import to get you started. A list of new (and some older) automated emails are indexed by subject, along with relevant actions, here. If you are going to working on puppet, you should also look at this page on how to read releng shared emails. Calendar Like mail, we now use Google calendar. You'll want to subscribe to the following public calendars: Release Engineering - Public Releng PTO Talk to your manager/mentor to get added to the various other private calendars as appropriate. Access Bugzilla Almost everything at Mozilla goes through Bugzilla. Create a Bugzilla account if you have not already. You'll need a few tweaks to your account to get access to everything releng-related: Add privileges for bugzilla group "build" (Mozilla Build Team) (Can be done by coop, catlee, hwine, or bugzilla admin.) Add your irc nickname & ldap username as "aliases" for your account log into bugzilla & follow links "Preferences" -> "Account Information" append the aliases, with a leading ':' and enclosed in brackets ('[]') to the "Real Name" field e.g.: "Hal Wine [:hwine]" Excellent video showing how to do power searches: Bugzilla Quick Search (5 minutes you NEED to give yourself) QuickSearch help Filing bugs against Release Engineering The product to use is, unsurprisingly, "Release Engineering." There are multiple possible components under that product, so take your best guess or ask for guidance in IRC. LDAP, SSH, VPN Warning for people who already have an LDAP account: Change your password. Otherwise, adding you to the releng group may lock your account without further notice. There is a stronger password policy in releng: users must change their password every 3 months. If you don't change your password, the only symptom will be that one day or another (already observed after 8 days), your regular password won't work anymore. If this happens to you, contact people in #servicedesk, they will be able to reset your password. This is mostly applicable only to employees and interns, although it *is* possible for other contributors to acquire some limited LDAP access. Speak to someone you work with on the releng team if you would like to investigate this. SSH keys are used for access to most machines, and some of them are stored in your LDAP record: Add your SSH public key to your LDAP account, at https://login.mozilla.com/ You'll need a number of other bits set in your LDAP object to access releng networks and systems via the VPN. Full instructions for accessing the VPN are on mana. this usually starts by generating a certificate at https://login.mozilla.com/ file a bug against Product/Component: Infrastructure & Operations/MOC: Service Requests asking to be added to the releng and vpn_releng groups. Something similar to bug 1223449 If you're on MacOSX or Windows, you might want to request a license for Viscosity (A VPN client). To do so from service-now. 'Order Stuff' > 'Software Applications' > 'Viscosity VPN' > 'Buisness Support && follow onscreen instructions Your manager is responsible for making sure you belong to the following LDAP groups, ideally before your first day: cn=balrog,ou=groups,dc=mozilla
cn=corp-vpn,ou=groups,dc=mozilla

 Common Machines Once your SSH public key is associated with your LDAP record, you should have access a number of shared Mozilla hosts: people.mozilla.org (account is not automatic, use service-now to request). hg.mozilla.org (use full email address as username) (commit access is not automatic, see below for access) Build Machines Releng runs many, many machines, including: staging and production buildbot masters staging and production slaves servers hosting a variety of services a handful of shared releng machines for development We access these machines via SSH (all), VNC (all), or remote desktop (Windows), depending on the context of the activity we're performing. To add your SSH key to the buildslaves, you'll need to do something like bug 899315. File a bug in "Release Engineering: Platform Support" Checkout the puppet repo and create a patch Ask for a reviewer. Your mentor/manager are good options here. If you need an account on cruncher (shared releng machine), ask catlee, and send him your SSH public key. (If you aren't sure you need the account, you probably do not for now.) SSH Config You'll want to update your ~/.ssh/config accordingly: Host hg.mozilla.org git.mozilla.org
    User <short-ldap-name-here>@mozilla.com
    Compression yes
    ServerAliveInterval 300

Host *.mozilla.com
    User <short-ldap-name-here>
    Compression yes
    ServerAliveInterval 300

Host *.build.mozilla.org
    Compression yes
    User cltbld
    ServerAliveInterval 300 Mercurial (hg) Most development in releng (and at Mozilla writ-large) is stored in version control using hg. There is an excellent step-by-step guide for setting up and using hg: Mercurial for Mozillians The root webview of the Mozilla hg repositories is here: https://hg.mozilla.org/ Most releng code lives in repos under https://hg.mozilla.org/build There are 3 levels of commit access: Level 1 access allows you to use the Try Server and setup user repos. As a new contributor, you should request this on day one. Level 2 access is required to land code in the build and project repos. Once you have a proven track record of successful patches, you can ask your manager/mentor to vouch for your Level 2 access. Your manager/mentor can also land patches for you until you receive Level 2 access. Level 3 access is required to land code directly on mozilla-central and its derived release branches. At some point in your Mozilla contribution story, you may need Level 3 access but many contributors never do. Talk to your manager/mentor if you think you need this access. You should already have Level 2 access when you request Level 3. You need to file an IT bug to get hg commit access. Follow the instructions for Becoming a Mozilla Committer, and for Level 2, specify you need access to (at least) hg.mozilla.org/build/* (Product/Component: mozilla.org/Repository Account Requests). example request: bug 703351 Git & Github There are git mirrors of many popular Mozilla repositories. One of the Mozilla github admins (catlee, coop) can add you to the following GitHub groups: Mozilla-Releng organization Releng team within the Mozilla organization There are also a handful of git repos hosted directly by Mozilla. Your manager/mentor will let you know if you need access to one of these. (See also) PGP PGP keys are used for encrypting sensitive data - you are responsible for generating and managing you own keys. A quick, Mac-focused primer is available on the intranet or you can use the The GNU Privacy Handbook for reference. After you have created your keys, do try to get your key signed by other team members, and uploaded to gpg.mozilla.org. It is okay to reuse an existing gpg key, provided you add an additional ID for your canonical LDAP name (e.g. 'hwine [at] mozilla.com', not an alias like 'Hal_9001 [at] mozilla.com'). Other Services For access to other services, you'll need file a couple of bugs: Access to Nagios File a bug in bugzilla under 'MOC: Service Requests' Access to inventory File a bug under 'Infrastructure & Operations::WebOps: Inventory' Communication IRC The majority of day-to-day communication in releng happens on IRC: https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC irc://irc.mozilla.org irc.mozilla.org:6697 #mozbuild (use SSL, ask for the channel key; your nick needs to be registered) private team channel  * /attach ircs://irc.mozilla.org:6697/?pass=[your_irc_pass]
 * /join #mozbuild [access_key] irc.mozilla.org #releng public channel for discussion with sherrifs, and continuous integration bot keywords to hilite on: "!squirrel" is "I need eyes on this now" keyword in #mozbuild & #releng- please set your client to alert on it. "r?" - team member looking for a review, perhaps not in but (irc/pastebin) also useful to join #developers, #airmozilla, #sf, #mobile, #planning, #release-drivers, #ateam, #infra #sysadmins access_key is here https://mana.mozilla.org/wiki/display/SYSADMIN/IRC+use+within+IT #moco [access_key is here [n]] #firebot for hiliting when you're mentioned in a bug, review request, etc. http://chatzilla.hacksrus.com/faq/#connect Many folks run a BNC (an IRC bouncer) (e.g. znc) and/or irssi under screen to get continuous view of traffic. Ask around. (some good irssi notes) See below for a local pastebin install, so you don't paste huge amounts in channel. IT now also provides a hosted IRCCloud cloud instance you can partake of. NOTE: if you're using IRCCloud, and are invited to a password protected channel, IRCCloud will not have the password available to re-connect you. Do the following as soon as you enter the channel: Click the "Options" button Copy the password Click the "Leave" button Click the "Rejoin" button Paste the password into the text box. Wiki If you're reading this now, you found the wiki! ;) Please add yourself and details to the list of team members. Don't be shy about making improvements to releng pages based on your experiences. Getting someone in releng to review your changes first is good practice. Just ask in #releng. Useful templates (aka "macros") for releng, use bug 999 for bugzilla references; 6e453b4f7056 for hg revisions is also quite nice. Pastebin There's a local pastebin instance at http://pastebin.mozilla.org/, so you don't need to paste multi-lines into a channel. You'll find a helper script in the braindump repo at utils/pastebin. it creates a new page from stdin, and outputs the url to stdout an argument will be interpretted as the syntax highlighting format to use sample usage: hg diff | pastebin python | pbcopy (last part mac specific) set & export PASTEBIN_NAME if you don't want to post as anonymous. (Many folks now use the pastebin integrated into IRCCloud.) Google Drive Google Drive (formerly Google docs) is a preferred way to share things these days. This includes spreadsheets and documents that will change a great deal over time. Google Drive access should be enabled with your email account when you start. If you need access to a particular document, talk to the document owner or your manager/mentor. Mana Some internal Mozilla systems (IT, HR) are documented on mana. File a ServiceNow ticket if you don't have access when you start. Vidyo Services Our primary two way video meeting platform is Vidyo. Basic usage instructions are here. Especially if you are running linux, it is highly recommended that you install the client and make test calls prior to any meeting. Many of our team meetings are held in the ReleaseEngineering room. Pro tip: many folks have found the mobile client useful to have preinstalled as a backup device. If you're going to record a meeting, practice first. (Instructions are linked from mana page.)

Earnings: Mark Your Calendar Alphabet will be put to the test this month when it reports fourth-quarter results. Can it keep up its rapid growth? Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Jan 11, 2017 at 10:13AM Google parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is set to report results for its fourth quarter of 2016 on Thursday, Jan. 26. Before the numbers for the quarter are released, here's a broad overview of some areas to watch. Google offices. Image souce: Google. Revenue and EPS The pressure is certainly on for Alphabet's fourth quarter, especially after the company's expectation-beating quarter before it. For Alphabet's third quarter, both the company's revenue and earnings per share (EPS) exceeded expectations. Revenue and non-GAAP (non-generally accepted accounting principles) EPS was $22.5 billion and $9.06, respectively, up significantly from $18.7 billion and $7.35, respectively, in the year-ago quarter. Analysts, on average, expected third-quarter revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $22.1 billion and $8.63. Going into Alphabet's fourth quarter, analysts expect robust growth to continue, albeit not as sharply. On average, analysts expect fourth-quarter revenue and EPS of $25.1 billion and $9.63, up 18% and 11%, respectively, year over year. Metric Q3 YOY Growth Q3 YOY Growth Implied by Consensus Analyst Estimate Revenue 20% 18% Non-GAAP EPS 23% 11% There's merit to analysts' conservatism, particularly since Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat went out of her way during the company's third-quarter earnings call to remind analysts that the company will be up against tough year-ago revenue comparisons in the fourth quarter. Paid clicks and cost-per-clicks One of the reasons why Alphabet outperformed expectations in Q3 was because of its big increase in paid clicks, or the total number of clicks for which advertisers paid Google. Aggregate paid clicks in Q3 were up 9% sequentially and 33% year over year. Notably, some of the benefits from such a large increase in paid clicks was offset by 5% and 11% decreases in cost-per-click, or the amount advertisers pay Alphabet for each click, but the outsized gain in paid clicks was significant enough to help drive significant revenue growth. Investors should look for look for similar trends in Alphabet's paid clicks and cost-per-clicks in Q4. If the trends diverge in an unexpected direction, investors may want to look for an explanation from management during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call. New Google products Also, after launching some new Google-branded hardware, investors also may want to look for some updates from management on how these products are faring. While the new products still almost certainly will be immaterial to overall results, a promising start for the new devices could signal bigger opportunity ahead. Google Home. Image source: Google. In October, Alphabet launched two new significant products: a Google Pixel smartphone and a Google Home artificial intelligence-enabled smart speaker. The Pixel quickly sold out online, and Google Home ended up selling out in many stores during the holidays -- evidence of the high demand for these new products. Indeed, in a statement to 9to5Google, a Google spokesperson specifically said demand was to blame for the Pixel selling out: We're thrilled to see the excitement for our new Pixel phones, and frankly pre-order demand has exceeded our expectations. We're working to restock our inventory as soon as possible. While Alphabet hasn't yet proven it can build a sustainable and meaningful hardware business, maybe the Pixel smartphone and Google Home could finally change this. Alphabet will report its fourth-quarter results immediately after market close on Jan. 26. Management will host a conference call to discuss the results at 4:30 p.m. EST.

Spare5 founders, from left to right: Patrick O’Donnell, Founder and Chief Architect; Matt Shobe, Founder and Chief Product Officer; Matt Bencke, Founder and CEO; Daryn Nakhuda, Founder and CTO. Photo via Mighty AI. On the surface, artificial intelligence is sexy. The technology, which has become one of the hottest trends, helps turn products and services human-like, accomplishing computational tasks that were either previously impossible or took far too long. But underneath the AI lays less flashy, yet equally crucial infrastructure that makes everything tick. It’s why computer vision and natural language model companies like Mighty AI are becoming more and more important — and also why investors like Intel, Accenture, and Google just put their money behind the Seattle startup. Matt Bencke. Mighty AI, previously known as Spare5, today announced a $14 million round led by Intel Capital, the investing arm of Intel, and also included participation from Accenture and GV, the investing arm of Google. Previous investors like Foundry Group, Madrona Venture Group, and New Enterprise Associates (NEA) also participated; total funding in Spare5 is now $27 million. Mighty AI originally launched in 2014 as Spare5, debuting an app that enables everyday people to perform short tasks on their smartphone — like photo tagging, price guessing, and sentiment analysis of text —  in exchange for payment. Then late last year, the startup narrowed its focus on what it calls “Training Data as a Service,” as CEO and co-founder Matt Bencke told GeekWire. The service provides the human insights AI engines need to “think” like people and helps companies across a variety of industries scale their computer vision and natural language models. Mighty AI, the first spin-out from Madrona Venture Labs, is essentially making artificial intelligence more intelligent by using human labor to re-tune those models. Bencke said his team is solving a “big data problem” at enterprise scale by turning “blank slates into simulations of human knowledge,” as the company describes. An example of Mighty AI helping identify objects in a photo and training computer vision models. Photo via Mighty AI. Now Spare5 is having a re-launch of sorts with a new name and a more focused product. Bencke was careful not to call the strategic change a “pivot,” but more doubling down on an opportunity. “Everybody knows AI is probably the biggest wave in technology innovation right now,” explained Bencke, formerly a senior vice president at Getty Images. “Yet there is a lot of anticipation and frustration about seeing it applied successfully across a number of specific use cases. I think our investors are looking at us as providing picks and shovels to the AI goldrush. No one knows exactly where the gold is, but everyone knows you need picks and shovels.” Bencke added that if AI engines don’t have good training data, then you “basically have a really expensive data science team.” He said the AI models need to understand how humans think; Mighty AI provides this via its community of “Fives,” the human users who get paid by the company to perform short tasks that improves training data. “Training data isn’t the sexiest part of AI,” Bencke said. “But it is vital.”  Personal digital assistants like Amazon’s Alexa or Apple’s Siri, for example, have the benefit of using conversations with users to improve their data sets. But other applications that aren’t consistently interacting with end users don’t have this benefit — that’s where Mighty AI comes in with help. “A computer is only as smart as the people who train it or teach it,” Bencke said. One customer is GumGum, a computer vision company that sells advertising and visual intelligence solutions for brands and publishers. GumGum uses Mighty AI to help advertisers understand the context of where their advertisement will be placed, either on websites or social media. “They need to train their computer vision models to recognize logos in all kinds of different context,” Bencke noted. Mighty AI, which has also developed its own AI technologies to help improve the quality of the “Fives” community, does have competition in the form of services like Amazon Mechanical Turk and CrowdFlower, but Bencke said those require more management from employees. “We are agnostic about domains,” Bencke added. “We are just trying very hard to abstract human knowledge and make it available to our customers on demand.” As a result of the funding, Mighty AI will partner with Intel and Accenture, who will promote and sell the company’s training data services to customers worldwide. Ken Elefant, managing director at Intel Capital, told GeekWire that Intel sees AI as the “next major turning point in human history” with applications like automated driving, robotics, healthcare, and IoT. Elefant said Mighty AI has the best CEO and team compared to other competitors.  We are just trying very hard to abstract human knowledge and make it available to our customers on demand. “Unlike other traditional business outsourcing or crowdsourcing sources, Mighty AI can provide high quality, domain specific, on-demand data annotation, gathered via a community of thousands of experts,” he said. The 30-person company, named a Seattle 10 startup in 2015, will use the fresh funding to grow its team and build out its platform. Bencke called the new investor group a “dream team of strategic partners who are also investing.” Along with Bencke, the Mighty AI leadership team is impressive. CTO Daryn Nakhuda is a former CTO at TeachStreet and Director of Engineer at Porch; Patrick O’Donnell co-founded Urbanspoon; and Matt Shobe helped start of Feedburner. Robin Murdoch, a global managing director at Accenture, called Mighty AI “a leader in the critical area of training data.” “It’s an area that is particularly challenging for our clients, and their technology will help us develop and implement AI solutions that help our clients’ businesses compete more effectively,” he said. Mighty AI is one of many new AI/machine learning startups in Seattle, which is becoming somewhat of an epicenter for companies developing technologies related to machine learning, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, algorithms, data analytics, and more.

According to the witness, in a report submitted to the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), and filed in the organization’s database as case 81433, he and his son were puzzled when they accidentally spotted the dark triangle UFO hovering over their home on Google Maps. “My son was looking for his phone and realized it was on his bed. When he picked it up, Google satellite was somehow pulled up on his phone. He was like what the heck! So he started looking at what the satellite map was on,” the witness wrote. “He realized it was on our house. He was shocked to see a object hovering over our house. The object appeared to be triangle in shape and brown in color.” The witness was uncertain about the nature of the dark object looming in the clouds over his home. He wondered whether it was a leaf “or something on the satellite lens.” But he concluded that it “looks like a UFO.” Dark Triangle UFO Over Neighbourhood In Louisville, Kentucky Following Google Map Car, UFO Sighting News. https://t.co/4MuHMTXHYu pic.twitter.com/RljuctOPgL — Scott  (@SCWBooks) January 11, 2017 Veteran UFO hunter Scott Waring was convinced that the man and his son had accidentally spotted a UFO hovering in the clouds over their house. According to the popular but controversial UFO blogger in a January 11 post to his UFO Sightings Daily blog, although the witness did not specify the Google coordinates he found it after a long search. He was also able to confirm that a Google satellite image shows a dark triangle UFO hovering over the house in Louisville. The dark UFO was concealed partially in thick clouds. “At the coordinates of 38° 6’23.28″N 85°51’20.04″W, if you go into street view by dragging and dropping the orange person icon in this location, you will notice a dark UFO hanging over a white house,” Waring wrote. “I looked around the neighborhood on street view and found that the dark triangle was following the Google car for a little ways.” Waring did not try to explain why the mysterious UFO was following the Google Maps street view car, but he noted that the Google camera captured the UFO despite the fact that it [the UFO] appeared cloaked in thick clouds. #Florida witness creates model of Triangle #UFO https://t.co/hUTDIJBAse via @openmindstv pic.twitter.com/XE4VMyT3ZJ — Open Minds UFO News (@openmindstv) May 16, 2016 “Cloaking,” according to UFO enthusiasts, is a method that UFOs use to conceal their presence from human observers on the ground. “It was probably cloaked, but the Google cameras digital eye caught it,” Waring commented. The UFO hunter then claimed that Google has a special program that it uses to blur faces, license plates, and UFOs. “If you notice, the blur over the window and the blur over the UFO appear to be made by the same cover up tool,” he wrote. UFO hunters believe that big tech companies, such as Google, collaborate with the government to conceal UFO and alien evidence for several reasons. The government, according to believers, takes pains to conceal UFO evidence out of fear that full disclosure of the presence of technologically advanced aliens visiting our world could spark mass panic. Others conspiracy theorists claim that the government hides UFO evidence because officials want to keep people in the dark about ongoing official contact with representatives of alien civilizations visiting Earth. The U.S. government, according to conspiracy theorists, has signed a technology transfer treaty with a number of alien races, including the Grays, Reptilians, and Tall Whites. The government keeps its contact and treaties with the alien races top secret because it does not want to share the benefits of access to advanced exotic technology with foreign governments. Vimana and Edgar Fouche's UFO TR-3Bhttps://t.co/aohzCCScvH pic.twitter.com/WPVbZ04n4o — MIRAHORIAN (@MIRAHORIAN) May 15, 2016 UFO hunters also believe that the U.S. government has been in possession of advanced alien technology since 1947 when the military authorities reportedly recovered an alien UFO craft that crashed near a ranch in Roswell, New Mexico. It is believed that the alien craft and others recovered from other crash sites over the decades were used by government scientists and engineers to conduct reverse-engineering research and development work. Over the decades, the U.S. government has reverse-engineered alien aerospace technology and built several prototypes of a new generation of advanced stealth reconnaissance crafts, including the TR-3A Black Manta, the TR-3B Aurora, and the TR-3B Astra, according to conspiracy theorists. The Astra is believed to be a stealth reconnaissance craft based on advanced alien anti-gravity propulsion technology (read more about the TR-3B Astra here). Reported sightings of mysterious black triangle UFOs from across the country have led UFO enthusiasts to suggest that the U.S. government could be conducting late-stage flight tests of a new generation of stealth reconnaissance crafts based on advanced alien UFO technology. The goal of the alleged Pentagon black project, according to conspiracy theorists, is to develop “nuclear-powered triangle-shaped aircraft capable of hovering, accelerating from rest at incredible rates, and flying stealthily like alien UFOs,” as reported by the Inquisitr last May. UFO enthusiasts are debating whether the latest alleged sighting was authentic, and if authentic, whether the UFO was a government reverse-engineered craft undergoing flight tests or an alien craft visiting Earth.

Photos of the weekend SUBSCRIBE European Union Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova holds a news conference on the European Commission's proposal for new digital privacy legislation, at the EC headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, on Jan. 10, 2017. Yves Herman/Reuters | Caption Ben Rosen Staff | @Benji_Rosen January 10, 2017 —In an effort to enhance privacy laws, European regulators have set their sights on digital cookies.  Cookies are pint-sized pieces of code that track information such as the sites web surfers visit and where they log in. But they could spell major losses for online advertisers and companies like Google and Facebook if the European Union adopts a law that would require users to actively consent to cookies' use. The European Commission, the executive arm of the 28-nation bloc, submitted the proposed legislation on Tuesday, dubbing it the Regulation on Privacy and Electronic Communications. The European Parliament and member states must approve it before it becomes law. They can also amend the legislation as they debate it.   As it stands now, the proposed regulation would replace the bloc’s ePrivacy Directive last revised in 2009, before the classified information Edward Snowden leaked changed the way the world views digital privacy. Since then, the European Union has made protecting the privacy of its citizens a priority: The bloc adopted sweeping reforms last spring, and ruled against Britain’s so-called “Snooper’s Charter” that requires telecommunication companies to keep records of people's web activity for one year and grants government officials access to that data. But online advertisers and advocates warn the latest legislation will send shockwaves across the World Wide Web – and perhaps lead to more distracting pop-ups for users. How secure is your data? Take our quiz and find out “This proposal risks harming the livelihood of millions of websites and apps that rely on digital advertising to fund content and tools for consumers, not just in Europe, but in the US as well,” says Dave Grimaldi, the Interactive Advertising Bureau’s executive vice president of public policy, in a statement emailed to The Christian Science Monitor. “As written, it will diminish our members’ ability to innovate by introducing prescriptive rules that cannot adapt to the rapidly evolving digital economy. Citizens in Europe and around the world are better served by laws and self-regulatory regimes that protect consumers without hindering access to their digital world,” he said. The new law would require companies to get the consent of users before accessing their digital information. In doing so, the law would require web browsers, on installation, to ask users whether they want to allow websites to place cookies on their browser. If a user rejects the request, they would still see ads online, but they wouldn’t necessarily be personalized to cater to users’ potential interests. Under the proposal, companies that don’t comply with the regulations will face fines of up to 4 percent of their global turnover. This targeted advertising, in which ads are personalized to a user based on their search history, is a major source of revenue, especially for companies like Google and Facebook that offer free web email and social media services. Last year, digital ad spending in Western Europe stood at $35 billion and is set to approach $45 billion by 2020, according to market-research firm eMarketer. In Britain alone, online advertising generates 10 billion pounds ($12.16 billion) of revenue for publishers and content creators, according to the Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB).  It is unclear how much digital ad revenue comes specifically from targeted online ads. But if a significant number of users opt out of those premium, targeted ads, it could hit the bottom line for big online ad brokers like Google and Facebook, The Wall Street Journal reports. Google declined to comment. Facebook did not respond to a request for comment by press time. Digital privacy remains important to both Europeans and Americans. As the European Commission noted in a press release about the proposed legislation, 92 percent of Europeans say it is important or very important their personal information on their digital devices can only be accessed with their permission, according to its Eurobarometer survey. Ninety-two percent of the more than 25,000 respondents also said it is important or very important the confidentiality of their emails and online instant messaging be guaranteed. These responses mirror American attitudes. A 2015 survey by the Pew Research Center found 93 percent of Americans say that being in control of who can get information about them is important, while 90 percent of respondents say that controlling what information is collected about them is important. “The proposed Regulation on Privacy and Electronic Communications seeks to address those concerns,” according to a statement from the European Commission. “At the same time, the new rules will support innovation and increase consumer trust.” It also might annoy users, Townsend Feehan, chief executive of IAB Europe, said in a statement. If passed, the legislation might lead companies to display pop-ups asking users to switch their settings to allow cookies before they can access services. “People who thought cookie banners were annoying will be disappointed to hear that things won’t get better,” Ms. Feehan said. The proposed legislation is in line with sweeping privacy reforms the European Parliament adopted in April which are set to take effect in spring 2018. The General Data Protection Regulation provides a single set of rules on internet privacy safeguards, giving individuals vastly greater control over how their information is handled by both European and American tech companies, as Colette Davidson reported for the Monitor.

But the World-Wide Web Consortium (W3C) – composed of software companies, academics, privacy groups, and others who determine international Web-browsing standards – has long struggled to develop a unified approach for the feature.

Google has rolled out the mobile intrusive interstitials penalty Mobile ads Google to launch automated call extensions on Feb. 6 Subscribe to SearchCap SUBSCRIBE SEO SEM Mobile Local Retail Google Bing Social Home SEO Everything you need to know about SEO, delivered every Thursday. SUBSCRIBE Google confirms rolling out the mobile intrusive interstitials penalty yesterday Google said the mobile intrusive interstitial penalty went live yesterday, but webmasters have not claimed any issues yet. Barry Schwartz on January 11, 2017 at 8:40 am More Google has officially confirmed they have begun rolling out the intrusive mobile interstitial penalty yesterday. Google warned us that this was coming almost a six months ago, and it did start rolling out on January 10, 2017, as Google promised. Google’s John Mueller and Gary Illyes confirmed the penalty began rolling out yesterday. This penalty only impacts intrusive interstitials that happen directly after going from a Google mobile search result to a specific page. It does not impact or penalize pages after that, so if you have a intrusive interstitial that comes up later in the click path on your website, this won’t impact it: it only looks for the intrusive interstitial after the click from the Google search results page. Google said this means “pages where content is not easily accessible to a user on the transition from the mobile search results may not rank as highly.” Google explained which types of interstitials are going to be problematic, including: showing a popup that covers the main content, either immediately after the user navigates to a page from the search results or while they are looking through the page. displaying a standalone interstitial that the user has to dismiss before accessing the main content. using a layout where the above-the-fold portion of the page appears similar to a standalone interstitial, but the original content has been inlined underneath the fold. Here is a diagram from Google to convey the above points: Google listed three types of interstitials that “would not be affected by the new signal” if “used responsibly.” Those types are: Interstitials that appear to be in response to a legal obligation, such as for cookie usage or for age verification. Login dialogs on sites where content is not publicly indexable. For example, this would include private content such as email or unindexable content that is behind a paywall. Banners that use a reasonable amount of screen space and are easily dismissible. The app install banners provided by Safari and Chrome are examples of banners that use a reasonable amount of screen space. Here is a diagram from Google to convey the above points: We have yet to hear of webmasters complaining about being hit by this penalty, but as things change, we will let you know.

Fewer than 0.1% of people are using the outdated version of Google’s mobile operating system anymore, according to a new report from the tech giant itself. There is still an incredibly small number of people using Android 2.2, but the stats (direct from Google) suggest Froyo devices that have accessed the Google Play Store in the last week are on the brink of extinction.  Basically, no-one who is still on Android Froyo is downloading apps or games anymore and are sitting off Google's radar. It's unlikely we'll ever see the day Android Froyo fully dies - people will always be experimenting with older versions of Android's OS or still using Android 2.2 on older devices as they don't realize how outdated it is. But from Google's perspective, Froyo is dead. So long Froyo, thanks for the features Froyo brought USB tethering and Wi-Fi hotspot features to Android when it launched in May 2010. The software was available on phones such as the HTC Desire, Nexus One, Huawei IDEOS, HTC Wildfire and the Motorola Droid X - devices that cemented Android as a credible alternative. The next release after Froyo, Android 2.3.3 Gingerbread, is still going strong with 1% of Android devices running the software. The most popular software remains Android Lollipop with Android 5 taking up 10.1% of devices and 5.1 running on 23.3% of devices. Android 6 Marshmallow is also popular with 29.6% of devices while Android 4.4 KitKat is on 22.6% of devices. Last year's Android 7 Nougat release still only makes up 0.7% of devices out there.

SOCIAL MEDIA TOOLKIT The 1 Sentence That Will Make (or Break) Your LinkedIn Profile Here's the first step needed to create a client-attracting, lead-generating LinkedIn profile. By John Nemo John Nemo is the author of the Amazon bestseller LinkedIn Riches: How to Leverage the World’s Largest Professional Network to Enhance Your Brand, Generate Leads, and Increase Revenue! @JohnNemoPR Founder and CEO, LinkedIn Riches@JohnNemoPR 1 COMMENTS CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement There are still so many misconceptions on how LinkedIn can be used, especially when it comes to winning new business for yourself on the platform. Case in point: Did you realize that LinkedIn is actually one of the most powerful, B2B-themed search engines on the planet? With nearly 500 million professionals in 200 countries, and with two new members joining every second, you have a whole lot of potential clients and customers under the same digital roof. (Related: The New Search Engine That Could Give Google a Run for Its Money.) Because LinkedIn is a searchable database, similar to Google, users can type in keywords and phrases to find certain types of professionals to connect with or services they want provided. Along with using LinkedIn to find your ideal prospects and clients, you can also get "found" on the world's largest social media platform for professionals. And it all starts with a single sentence. Your LinkedIn Profile Headline = Sales Gold To begin, consider the small section of your LinkedIn profile that appears right below your name at the top of your LinkedIn profile page. This is your professional headline, and it follows you everywhere you go on the platform. When it comes to selling on LinkedIn, getting your professional headline right is key to not only getting "found" on the platform, but also to enticing potential clients and customers to want to learn more about you. The Big Mistake in Most LinkedIn Profiles  If you're like most people on LinkedIn, you likely set your profile up as a virtual résumé, and thus your professional headline only features your job title. The problem with a LinkedIn profile headline and Summary section that are essentially a third-person rendering of your job duties, your role at your company, awards you've won, etc., is that nobody cares. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but nobody really cares about what you want. Rather, people care about what they want, and are only going to be interested in you if you can show them how you'll help them reach their goals or solve their problems. As a result, you need to make your LinkedIn profile what I call "client facing." It needs to be all about the audiences you serve, the goals they attain when they partner with you, and the products or services you provide these audiences to achieve their goals and desired outcomes. (Related: How to Create a Killer LinkedIn Profile!) When it comes to your LinkedIn profile's professional headline, you need to be both client-facing and SEO conscious. Consider the keywords and phrases that your clients would use to search for you on Google. How do you want to be discovered? What would people type in? Would they type in "Business Coach?" or "Revenue Consultant?" Would they type in "Keynote Speaker" or "Minneapolis Pest Control Services?" They would not type in something like, "CEO, Company X" or "Marketing Director", which is what far too many LinkedIn headlines read like right now. 1 Simple Sentence That Will Win You New Business on LinkedIn LinkedIn gives you 120 characters (or around 18-20 words) for your professional headline, and it's the perfect opportunity to add in your ideal keywords and phrases. This, in turn, will help your profile have a better chance of getting "found" when users are searching LinkedIn for someone who provides your specific products or services. In addition, your LinkedIn headline should answer these three questions: What would others call me? (Business Coach, Finance Consultant, etc.) What service or product do I provide? (Business Coaching, Financial Consulting, etc.) What audiences do I serve? (Entrepreneurs, Small Business Owners, etc.) So a sample LinkedIn headline for a Business Coach could be as follows: "Business Coach | Business Coaching Services | Serving Small Business Owners and Entrepreneurs" You've included common keyword phrases (Business Coach, Business Coaching) people might type in when searching LinkedIn, and you've identified some niche audiences (Entrepreneurs, Small Business Owners) that you serve. See how this works? The key is making it clear, simple and fast for people to decipher who you are, who you serve and what you provide. This approach starts with your LinkedIn professional headline, and should flow through the rest of your profile, with your Summary area, testimonials and so on. (Related: The Ultimate LinkedIn Profile Template!)

It wasn’t too long ago that we were discussing the merits of having a camera strapped to your face. Apple is reportedly working on a similar solution, and while we don’t have a catchy moniker quite yet, they do have a solid partner. Google Glass may be dead in the water as we knew it, but those Snapchat Spectacles have definitely picked up some steam. They went from being the butt of many jokes to having folks purchase prescription lenses, so there is certainly something to this particular trend. According to a new report, Apple will be teaming up with Carl Zeiss for an eyewear solution of their own. Apple is reportedly working with Carl Zeiss on a pair of digital glasses that may… or may not be announced this year. The spectacles are said to be of the AR variety and will connect to your handset via Bluetooth to give you a heads-up-display of sorts. The report states that nothing is “solid” and they are currently exploring the idea of a device although it could arrive sooner than later. Especially considering Apple has been leaning towards AR and away from VR for quite some time. 2017 will be a banner year for Apple regardless of any digital eyewear. The iPhone 8 with its rumored Edged panel will be the hottest seller of the year and we may get a matching iPad to boot. If Apple dropped a pair of AR eyeglasses next year it would certainly be a surprise as the usually move at a snails pace when it comes to new devices. Would you be interested in digital glasses from Apple and Zeiss? via – 9to5Mac      source Tags AccessoriesappleARGlasses Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Add to Google+ Add to Pinterest Post navigation Previous article Previous post: HTC Desire 650 specs include 2GB of RAM and Snapdragon 430 Next article Next post: HTC Ocean Note Design leak spills the beans on Secondary Display Adam Adam is a techie, who loves new gadgets and all things Westeros.

Some of the major Android Wear partners decided against launching new models at least until the second major update for the platform is released later this year. Google has gradually been removing some of those old smartwatches from its online store. If you’ve been meaning to pick up a Fossil smartwatch, you should keep in mind that you can’t buy a Fossil smartwatch from the Google Store anymore. Google appears to be cleaning up the hardware offerings on its online store, particularly smartwatches, because it has removed the listings for the Fossil smartwatches soon after removing the remaining Huawei Watch models from the store. At one point, all of Fossil’s smartwatches were sold through Google Play. The lineup included the Q Founder which was released in 2015 as well as the Q Marshal and Q Wander both of which were released late last year. Google is no longer selling all three of these smartwatches through its online store, the move makes sense, these smartwatches didn’t really take off. If you absolutely must purchase a Fossil Q Founder, Q Marshal or a Q Wonder, then head over to Fossil’s website because the company is still selling them directly to anyone who wants to spend their money on one.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY   TRIVIA Search How-To Geek How to Convert Images to Black and White on Your Smartphone Converting an image to black and white is one of those simple tasks that photographers should be able to do well on any device. Unfortunately, a lot of the apps that do black and white conversions on smartphones don’t give the photographer a lot of control. Let’s look at how to do it properly. How to Convert Images to Black and White on Android, the Easy Way If you’re feeling lazy and want a quick solution, Google Photos—which comes bundled with Android—has a very easy way to convert an image to black and white. First, open your photo in Google Photos. Then tap the “Edit” button, which looks like a pencil. When you do, you’ll be greeted with a number of filters. Some of these are black and white, so scroll through to find one you like and choose it. Alternatively, tap the adjustments button (the three sliders in the middle) and Adjust the “Color” slider all the way to the left. When you’re done, tap “Save” to save your photo. Google will save your edited photo as a copy, so you still have the original if you want it. This is the easy way. You can make it look even better if you’re willing to tinker, so check out our “better method” in the third section of this post. How to Convert Images to Black and White on iOS, the Easy Way Apple’s stock photos app has a very quick and easy way to convert an image to black and white, if you want the simplest solution. Open the image you want to edit in Photos and tap the slider icon in the upper right corner. You’ll get taken to Photos in built editor. Next, tap the three overlapping circles icon to access the Filters. There are three black and white filters to choose from: Mono, Tonal and Noir. Pick the one that works best for your image. I’ve gone with Noir. Tap done and the changes will be applied. Although Photos has some more powerful conversion tools built in, I find them a little confusing to use and not as flexible as other options. For a more advanced black and white conversion, check out the next section. How to Convert Images to Black and White, the Better Method If you really want your photo to look as good as possible, it’s more than just taking away the color. You can perform a lot of the following edits in Google Photos or Apple Photos, but I’m going to use Google’s Snapseed app (iOS, Android) for a few reasons: The same app is available on iOS and Android. It’s free. You get a bit more control than even Google and Apple Photos offer. It’s still simple to use. You can follow along with your photo editor of choice, but we really recommend Snapseed. Open Snapseed on your smartphone and tap Open. Scroll through your photos until you find the image you want to convert to black and white. Select it to open it in Snapseed. Tap the edit button (it’s the Pencil icon in the bottom right corner) to bring up the Tools and Filters options.   For this article, we only need to use the Black & White filter, so select it from the Filters menu. The image will now be in black and white, but we’re far from done. We’ve got plenty of options to tweak and play with—it’s the reason we’re using Snapseed and not just applying the Inkwell filter in Instagram. Let’s break down what each of the options does. By default (at least for me), the Presets menu is open when I apply the Black & White filter. There are six presets: Neutral, Contrast, Bright, Dark, Film and Darken Sky. They’re preset combination of the other settings we can configure rather than specific filters. For example, if you start with the Dark preset and then brighten it, you’ll end up with something that looks like the Neutral preset. Brighten it some more, and you’ll get the Bright preset, even though you started with Dark. When you’re editing your image, try each preset to see what works well as a base for your image. I like Dark, but different things will work for different images. The sliders icon in the middle of the screen brings up three options: Brightness, Contrast and Film Grain. These are the three options you’ll use the most to control how your image looks. Brightness controls the overall brightness of the image, Contrast the contrast and Grain adds noise to emulate the look of old films. The Dark preset has already decreased the Brightness of my image by 20 and increased the Contrast by 20. Different presets have different effects. Swipe up and down on the screen to scroll through the three options. Swipe left to decrease the value and swipe right to increase it. You can access the three options at any time by swiping up and down. At the top of the screen, you can see which option you have currently selected and can always change it by swiping left and right. For my image, I’ve gone with a Brightness of -10, a Contrast of +25 and a Grain of +10. Play around with the options and go with whatever works for your image. You can always go back and change things. The final configuration options are the Color Filters. Tap the circular icon at the bottom of the screen to select them. The Color Filters work in a slightly weird way. They emulate physical filters that film photographers used to put in front of their lenses to modify the color of light and thus, how each color is converted to black and white. Because of how light works, each filter actually darkens the complementary colors of the filter color. For example, a red filter lets red light through but darkens blues and greens. The Neutral filter leaves everything as normal. The Red filter darkens blues and greens. The Orange filter darkens blues and greens. The Yellow filter darkens blues and magentas. The Green filter darkens reds. The Blue filter darkens reds and yellows. That’s only a very rough guide as each filter has a slightly different effect on each color, but you don’t have to remember any of it. To find a filter that works well for your image, just try each one. If you don’t like any, go with the Neutral filter. For my image, I went with the Yellow filter. There are three buttons left we haven’t covered yet. In the top right corner is the before/after button. Hold this down to see what your image looked like before any edits. It’s really useful for making sure the changes you’re making improve the image. The X in the bottom left corner cancels all the changes you’ve made while the tick in the bottom right corner accepts them. When you’re done, tap the tick in the bottom right to apply all the edits. Now it’s time to save the image out. That way you can share it to social media or just keep a copy for yourself. Tap the Save button and then select the option you want to use. Normally, I save a Copy. And that’s it, you’re done. Here’s what mine looks like after all the editing. Sure, we could have just used a filter, but a little more editing goes a long way.

Almost every traditional desktop or laptop PC runs on the Santa Clara company’s processors, but that tradition is fast being eroded by more mobile, ARM-powered alternatives. Apple’s most important personal computers now run iOS, Google’s flagship Chromebook has an ARM flavor, and Microsoft just announced Windows for ARM. And what’s more, the burden of processing tasks is shifting away from the personal device and distributed out to networks of server farms up in the proverbial cloud, leaving Intel with a big portfolio of chips and no obvious customer to sell millions of them to. If you want to talk about the most influential chip company in history, Intel’s name is the one you want. But the most influential for the future? That’s a much more open question. AMD (blue) and Nvidia (green) stock prices over the past year Yahoo! Finance During the course of 2016, Nvidia and AMD saw their stock prices skyrocket. Both companies are now trading at multiple times their value from a year ago, and the explanation lies in their massively expanded potential for future growth. All the AI hype that we heard during CES this past week is underpinned by a multitude of algorithms and mathematical calculations, and in its most sophisticated form it harnesses methods of machine learning and deep learning to evolve its awareness without being fed answers directly by a human. All of that new technology requires a lot of processing power, and it just so happens that AMD and Nvidia were already making the perfect processors for the task: graphics cards. GPUs, or graphics processing units, can be thought of as a specialized breed of the CPUs that Intel dominates in. Unlike central processing units, however, graphics chips are less versatile in the tasks they can perform and are best suited to running a ton of parallelized workloads. They don’t have four or eight cores, they have hundreds and thousands, and each of them is frightfully efficient at handling some small recurring tasks over and over again. GPU acceleration has fast become the standard for machine learning, and this year Google’s Cloud Platform will be powered by AMD’s FirePro server GPUs. It’s not that Intel is oblivious to the expanding market being created by the move toward machine learning — the company has an entire aspirational website dedicated to the subject — but its chips are at a fundamental disadvantage and it hasn’t secured the customers or made the same sort of progress that its rivals already have. Radeon Instinct GPUs (click image to expand) AMD AMD now has an entire line of GPUs dedicated to accelerating machine learning, which has been branded as Radeon Instinct. Every single trending thing in tech can benefit from these new cards: from autonomous vehicles, self-piloting drones, and personal robots to fintech, nanobots, and advanced medicine. Investors are buying up AMD stock because they know the processing challenges of the future are practically tailored for the massively parallel architecture of a GPU — and AMD has some really good GPUs. GPU server farms are going to be as significant to our future as ocean-floor cables are to our present Nvidia’s rise is also no surprise. The green graphics giant has been talking about deep learning and autonomous cars for at least three years at CES. It was bemusing at first, intriguing after a while, and now it’s turning into real-world self-driving vehicles thanks to a partnership with Audi. At the same time as Google and AMD were announcing their 2017 plans for Radeon-driven machine learning in the cloud, Nvidia and IBM revealed their own agreement to provide "the world’s fastest" deep learning enterprise solution. These deals might not be rich on hype, but one day soon they’re going to be as significant as the ocean-floor cables keeping the internet connected today. If I had money to invest, I'd buy as much $NVDA as possible pic.twitter.com/0h2aO6v9gh— Darshan Shankar (@DShankar) January 5, 2017 The next time a company offers you a cloud-based service of any kind — such as Google’s system for handwriting recognition in the new Chromebooks — odds are good that there’ll be a GPU farm somewhere churning through the mathematical tasks of making it happen. As AI and VR grow, so will graphics card sales More in line with their traditional businesses, AMD and Nvidia both stand to benefit from the growing consumer interest in virtual reality. The two most promising solutions, the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift, both require a reasonably beefy PC spec, replete with a modern and powerful graphics, so the more people buy into VR, the more GPUs each company is likely to sell. But the most interesting dynamic that’s developed over the past year is how, ever so subtly and behind the scenes, AMD and Nvidia have essentially stolen Intel’s future away from it. Intel exists to satisfy our processing needs, but just as we discover a rich new vein of computational power needs, it turns out that Intel’s CPUs have already been surpassed by the basic architectural advantages of chips that were originally designed to push pixelated shoot-em-up targets around a monitor. It’s a fun twist of fate for everyone outside Intel, and the good execution exhibited by both AMD and Nvidia so far also portends well for the speed of improvement in AI and machine learning capabilities. At a time when Intel is still scrambling to find mega-tasking scenarios for its chips, its GPU rivals are more concerned with how fast they can churn out the hardware to satisfy demand that looks set to only continue growing.

It offers the same functionality, and then some: namely a conversational voice AI assistant to help you with whatever it can. With that, it didn’t encompass all the great things we were used to from Google Now, namely its Screen Search feature’s (otherwise known as Google Now on Tap) ability to take a screenshot with the press of a button. You can still do that with the usual hardware button presses, but the software button is usually preferred for a couple of reasons: It’s less cumbersome. Some of us have mastered the awkwardness associated with it and the accidental phone actions it can produce, but others not so much. The screenshot cleans up any icons in the status bar, so it’s an easy way to get a clean status bar in your screenshot without having to actually clear it out. How the feature appears on Google Now. Anyway, the feature seems to be making its way into Google Assistant, albeit it at a slightly neutered fashion as it won’t work on the home screen. We suggest getting onto the latest beta version of the Google app, though you still may not see it right away as it could be a server-side rollout.

The list includes dozens of consumer products, business applications and developer tools, and it shows how broad and deep the company’s reach into the tech world has grown. The list is also littered with Google failures. Many of the products are familiar to hundreds of millions of people. These include the flagship Google search product, the Android mobile OS, YouTube (the largest video site in the world), Chrome (one of the world’s most widely distributed browsers), Gmail and Maps. Among the business applications that have a huge effect on the web are the Adwords and Adsense products. They power a huge number of the world’s website marketing e-commerce, offering publishers small and huge the ability to target audiences in way that traditional advertising does not. For small publishers who do not have ad sales forces, these technologies may be their only source of ad revenue. Among the Google initiatives that have largely failed, Google’s suite of office products was supposed to allow it to compete with Microsoft’s Word, Excel and PowerPoint products. Google Docs, Drive and Sheets have a large market with small businesses that use them for free. They were an early version of cloud-based business services but never found a market of businesses that would pay for them. Nevertheless, they are products that have become essential to small companies. Another of Google’s failed initiatives is Google+, which was meant to be the company’s Facebook killer. Alphabet has mostly abandoned the product, although it still has tens of millions of users. Another group of Google products are largely curiosities, most developed years ago, and are expensive for Google to operate. First among these is Google Earth, which allows people to see satellite images of virtually the entire globe and is strong enough for people to zoom in on their own homes and properties. Finally, Google has a long list of products that are obscure enough most people could not identify them. These include Google’s Camera product, which is not available in many countries. Also, Google Expeditions allows people to see the surfaces of other planets on virtual journeys, Google One Today allows people to give money to nonprofits and Google Nik Collections is a photo editing and enhancement product. Google’s 157 products not only show the company’s broad reach, but also the areas where it has tried to be a major success and failed.

By Liam Tung | January 11, 2017 -- 12:32 GMT (04:32 PST) | Topic: Enterprise Software Google Go leapfrogged 40 languages in the Tiobe Index last year. Image: Tiobe Index Google's Go is the programming language of the year, according to the long-running Tiobe Index, a search-based ranking that gauges the popularity of top and emerging languages among developers. Rather than acknowledging the most widely used language, the firm focused its Programming Language of 2016 award on the language that has seen the fastest growth in popularity and hence where developers might want to strengthen their programming skills. The ratings are based on popular searches on Google, Bing, Yahoo, Wikipedia, Amazon, YouTube, and Baidu. Google launches Android programming course for absolute beginners Google has designed an Android app developer course for people who've never programmed. Read More According to Tiobe, Go has been the biggest mover over the past year with "hardly any competition", gaining 2.16 percent in popularity and rising from 54th position in January 2016 to 13th in January 2017. It was followed by Dart, a Google-backed language, and Perl, which grew 0.95 percent and 0.91 percent, respectively. "The main drivers behind Go's success are its ease of learning and pragmatic nature. It is not about theoretical concepts such as virtual inheritance and monads but about hands-on experience," said Tiobe, which says it's seeing an uptick in customers adopting Go in an industrial setting. Google created Go in 2007 to accelerate programming on its own infrastructure and released it to the wider world in 2009. Go has since has been used to build popular projects such as Docker. The top five languages remained stable across the period, with Java leading, followed by C, C++, C#, and Python. However, C has suffered a dramatic decline in popularity, falling from 16 percent in January 2016 to nine percent today, as did Java, which fell 4.19 percentage points over the year to 17 percent. Microsoft's Visual Basic .NET meanwhile grew 0.38 percentage points to 2.96 percent, rising from seventh to sixth place, followed by JavaScript and Perl. Tiobe expects next year's top candidates to be Apple's Swift language, Julia, and the Microsoft-maintained TypeScript. Tiobe notes that TypeScript is "very popular in the commercial industry", seeing a rise from 169 last January to 137 this month.

The data shows, among other things, that Froyo has dropped to below the 0.1 percent mark, marking the end of what was the oldest active Android version until last month. The date was collected from Android devices visiting Google Play in the seven-day period ending January 9. Froyo in December's data held on for dear life with the version running on 0.1 percent of Android devices. It has now slipped to below that figure, and dropped from Google's Android distribution data - the company only lists Android versions with 0.1 percent or greater shares. Notably, the data also represents device running the latest Google Play app - which is only compatible with Android 2.2 and higher versions. The latest data now pushes Android Gingerbread to the top (in terms of oldest iteration) with 1 percent. Meanwhile, Google's latest version, Android Nougat, is ever so slowly increasing. Last month, Android 7.0 Nougat was listed as running on 0.4 percent active Android devices. Google has now split Android 7.0 and 7.1 up in the January data, both combined make up 0.7 percent of active devices. The past month saw a bunch of smartphones receiving the Android Nougat update. HTC early last month pushed out the Nougat update for its One M9 smartphone. Sony started rolling out the Nougat update for its Xperia X and Xperia X Compact smartphones. OnePlus kept its promise to roll out the the latest Android version for its OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T by the end of 2016. In the latest data, Google reported that Marshmallow has a total share of 29.6 percent of Android devices compared to the 26.3 percent reported in December - an increase in 3.3 percent. Based on the latest data, Marshmallow continues to be the most used version. Meanwhile, Android 5.0 and 5.1 Lollipop combined have a total share of 33.4 percent of active Android devices, which is lower compared to last month when it was at 34 percent. The data further shows that Android KitKat now runs on 22.6 percent of devices compared to 24 percent last month - a decrease of 1.4 percent. Android Jelly Bean sees a combined share of 11.6 percent while Android Ice Cream Sandwich shows a share of 1.1 percent, dropping from 12.8 percent and 1.2 percent respectively. Both the Nougat versions are expected to rise further in the next few months with most flagship smartphones in 2017 expected to run on the latest Android OS. Some 2016 flagship are also due to receive the update, most notable among them being Samsung's Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge smartphones, which the company revealed will begin receiving Android 7.1.1 version this month. The latest OpenGL version distribution numbers saw OpenGL 2.0 at 40.9 percent, OpenGL version 3.0 at 42.2 percent and OpenGL version 3.1 at 16.9 percent.

Daniel Cooper, @danielwcooper 01.11.17 in Internet Comments 562 Shares Share Tweet Share Save Getty Wall Street has been pushing Google to behave more like a regular company, hacking and slashing at its longer-term projects and R&D divisions. Now, Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat has her sword pointed at the search engine's satellite imaging unit, Terra Bella. According to both the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg, Google will sell the division to a competitor, Planet, and buy mapping data from other companies in future. Terra Bella began life as Skybox Imaging, which Google bought for $500 million way back in 2014. The division has developed and launched seven satellites that take high-resolution snaps of our planet. Not only is the imagery used to update and improve Google Maps, but the data is also sold to third parties. It's believed that Planet doesn't have the cash to buy Terra Bella from Google for anywhere near the asking price. As such, the would-be suitor will hand Alphabet equity in its business in exchange for the satellite division. What we don't know, and probably won't for some time, is what this means for Skybox for Good. That was Google's ambitious plan to hand high-resolution mapping data to non-profits to help them track their work. Let's hope that nonprofits clearing minefields and preventing deforestation don't lose out to what could be some short-sighted cost-cutting.

Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Instagram YouTube RSS Skip to content SEO News Paid Search Content Marketing Social Media SEJ SUMMIT Tools Advertise How to Make Your Site Mobile-First in 2017 SEO January 11, 2017 SEO Aleh BarysevichJanuary 11, 2017 794SHARES 1.7KREADS 794SHARES 1.7KREADS Aleh Barysevich 794SHARES 1.7KREADS Speculating on the coming year’s trends is one of our favorite traditions in the SEO industry, and it almost wouldn’t feel like the holiday season without our annual SEO trends predictions. I love these annual predictions. You can ask 44 industry leaders the same question and get 44 unique and insightful answers. However, one trend I don’t think a single expert would disagree with is that mobile optimization is going to be more important than ever in 2017. Of course, all you need to do is look at Google’s major updates over the past few years to see that mobile SEO is more important than ever before. And after Google rolled out “Mobilegeddon” in April 2015 and the more recent mobile-friendly update in May 2016, I don’t think it surprised anyone that they capped the year by announcing “mobile-first” indexing. To quote Google’s Webmaster Blog: “Although our search index will continue to be a single index of websites and apps, our algorithms will eventually primarily use the mobile version of a site’s content to rank pages from that site, to understand structured data, and to show snippets from those pages in our results.” So how do you make your website mobile-first, instead of just mobile-friendly? Here are four essential tips to help you grow your mobile rankings in 2017: 1. Audit Your Site for Mobile-Friendliness Your website needs to be mobile-friendly before you can focus on making it mobile-first, so the first logical step is to take the Mobile-Friendly Test to see if you meet Google’s standards. With that done, you’ll want to run a comprehensive audit of your mobile site. Whatever tool you decide to use, you’ll want to make sure it can perform a full audit of your mobile website and also search for other SEO factors that affect ranking. Naturally, you’ll need to keep all of your resources crawlable so your audit can detect potential problems, such as broken links, thin content, missing meta descriptions, redirect chains, etc. It might be helpful checking out the step-by-step instructions on how to audit your site for mobile-friendliness in this article by my colleague Masha Maksimava. If you’ve run your website through the Mobile-Friendly Test and performed a site audit and you do not see the results you want, it’s time to start isolating any and all issues you can work to correct. Common SEO mistakes include: Slow mobile load times Broken or incorrect redirects Uncompressed images Blocked resources including JavaScript, CSS, and images Unsupported or unplayable content Intrusive pop-ups and other interstitials Mobile-only 404 errors As you correct mobile issues, you should use Google Search Console to monitor your progress. Go to Search Traffic > Mobile Usability to track the number of pages on your website that still have issues. 2. Optimize for Voice Search Last March, at SMX West, Google told us that voice search is the fastest growing type of search. Then in May, during a Google I/O keynote speech, we learned that 20% of all searches are voice searches. These details corroborated what we already knew, that 55% of teens and 40% of adults were already using voice search on a daily basis back in 2014, and that number has continued to grow ever since. So how do you optimize for voice search? I’ve already written about how to optimize your website for different virtual assistants, but the most important thing to remember is how and why people verbally query search engines differs from how they type queries: How we use voice search: Queries typed into Google are often abbreviated (e.g. “local Italian restaurants”), whereas most people will use voice search by asking a full question (e.g. “What is the closest Italian restaurant?”). To ensure that customers using voice search find your business, your SEO needs to include long-tail keywords that address these questions. Why we use voice search: According to Google’s Micro Moments Guide, voice search is most commonly used to satisfy four different types of queries: I want to know _______. I want to go _______. I want to do _______. I want to buy _______. As you can see, each of these queries (or “micro-moments”) aims to satisfy an immediate need. This means the best way to answer these questions is with fast, accurate answers. 3. Prioritize Local Search As voice search becomes more popular, local searches have also increased. In fact, Google’s Micro Moments Guide tells us that searches for businesses “near me” have increased 2x in the past year and that 1 in 3 smartphone users purchase from a brand other than the one they intended to because that brand showed up at the moment they searched for more information. In other words, if you truly want to be mobile-first, you need to be one of the top results whenever a potential customer searches for the services you offer. To do this you should: Register with Google My Business Include high-quality photos of your business Keep your NAP (name, address, phone number) consistent across every website you’re listed on Include a detailed schema markup Encourage reviews 4. Don’t Forget About AMP Google promotes AMPs (Accelerated Mobile Pages) above regular pages in response to mobile queries. These pages, denoted by a small lightning bolt, are designed to load almost instantaneously. According to Google, they’re approximately 4x faster than a regular mobile page and offer many mobile users exactly what they’re looking for: instant results that solve an immediate need. AMP pages use stripped down HTML coding and custom tags to achieve this lightning-fast load time, meaning that most articles will require two versions: An original version with full images and any multimedia you would normally include. An AMP version without any JavaScript, embedded content, lead forms, etc. AMP and WordPress sites are a match made in heaven; all you need to do is install the AMP plugin to enable the feature on your pages, and you’re set. This thorough article by Julia McCoy will teach you everything you need to know about how to adapt your content to Google AMP. The jury’s still out on whether or not optimizing for Google AMP will eventually be a necessity for every website, but I can confidently say that there is currently no better way for publishers (especially big publishers) to give their articles and news posts a huge boost. Final Thoughts If 2016 has taught us anything, it’s that the future is mobile. Smartphones are already responsible for 58% of all search queries, and now mobile-first indexing is right around the corner. So where does that leave us? Well, as SMFB Engine’s Kristjan Hauksson says in his 2017 prediction, “Mobile is not a trend [anymore]. It’s mandatory. But mobile might break many companies that are not keeping up. I am not sure AMP is the thing, but it’s definitely the first step toward what is to come.” In 2017, having a mobile-friendly site is no longer going to cut it; your website needs to be mobile-first.

Going to Google’s website currently only shows the Nixon Mission, Michael Kors Access, Moto 360, and Polar brand of smartwatches. Google typically doesn’t offer any details on why they decide to remove products when they do. One might assume it’s because the Fossil Q devices have gotten a bit long in the tooth by now — the first one launched in late 2016, after all. But the Moto 360 is even older than it, and it’s still rocking over at the Google Store. That leads us to believe that it has something to do with poor sales and Google simply being uninterested in ordering more stock.

Most smartphones and tablets have since received the update, and now owners are waiting on 7.0 Nougat. That said, users will still want to know everything Android 6.0 has to offer. This is a comparison of Android 5.1 Lollipop vs Android 6.0 Marshmallow on the Nexus 5 and Nexus 6. Advertisement This Android 6.0 Marshmallow walkthrough will show off many of the features and changes Google implemented into Android M in comparison to Android 5.1 Lollipop from 2014. With Android 6.0 the focus was on polishing and improving performance or battery life, not changing everything. As a result it looks similar on the surface, but is vastly different. Read: Nexus 6P Review: Google’s Finest Yet Google released the Android 5.1 Lollipop update in May, which fixed many of the problems and bugs from the first launch of Lollipop. Then with Android 6.0 Marshmallow they added an array of new features, fingerprint support, better control over how our phones can be used, Google Now on Tap, battery saving tools or optimization and much more. There are a few new features in Android N, but Marshmallow still has plenty to offer. Whether you want to get familiar with Android 6.0 on a smartphone you’ll buy on Black Friday, or just see what it can do, this is a good place to start. Just like with Android L in 2014, Google unveiled Android M in May, and released a developer preview for users to try on select Nexus smartphones and tablets. This was to test it before the final release date in October later that year. Google released three developer previews slowly fixing bugs or adding new features, then released the stable version for all its devices. Over the past year almost all Android devices have been updated to Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. Advertisement Users will notice some visual changes to animations and effects, the lockscreen, homescreen, notification pulldown bar, volume controls, tons of new permission controls, a revamped application launcher and Google Now menu, to name a few. However, it’s behind the scenes where things really took off. Permission and security controls, fingerprint support, Doze for nearly 30% improvements to battery life, automatic app and data backups, and so many things we won’t be able to list them all. Read: Android 5.0 vs Android 4.4 KitKat: What’s New in Lollipop With Android 5.0 Lollipop Google completely changed how Android looked compared to KitKat. Above is a quick comparison showing users what changed in 2014-15, and below is a big slideshow detailing exactly what to expect from Android 6.0 Marshmallow. While you’re here, see what to expect from Android 7.0 Nougat in December or early 2017. Android 6.0 Marshmallow is a free software update for all eligible Android smartphones and tablets, starting with Google’s own Nexus lineup. Many cover stock Android with their own interface, but most of the changes mentioned and compared below will still be included. Not to mention most manufacturers have pushed out Marshmallow already To begin Android 6.0 Marshmallow rolled out to the Nexus 5, Nexus 6, 2013 Nexus 7, Nexus 9 and the Nexus Player. Then eventually others like Samsung, Motorola, LG, HTC and more. The video below is an early look at Android 6.0 M from May, and many things have changed since, but it still gives users an idea of what to expect once Android 6.0 updates arrive if it hasn’t yet. Advertisement Most of what was shown above has now been added to the final release, but things like the Dark Theme settings and more have actually been removed. Below is an extensive slideshow comparing Android 6.0 Marshmallow to Android 5.1 Lollipop, and showing owners what’s new, what to look for, and what to expect. You can click on any of the images below to instantly jump to that image in the slideshow and see how that part of the OS compares to previous versions. The older Android 5.1 Lollipop is on the left (if applicable), while Android 6.0 Marshmallow is on the right. If you have a Nexus smartphone and tablet, you’re likely already running Android 7.0 Nougat. This shows Google’s slow and steady progression and improvements to their mobile operating system. Android 5.1 vs Android 6.0: Lockscreen   1 / 17 Again, every slide will have Android 5.1 on the left (if available) and the newer Android 6.0 Marshmallow on the right. Google changed the lockscreen in Android 5.0 to make things easier and more simple. It's very clean and plain, with some quick swipe icons to instantly launch voice controls, unlock the phone, or launch the camera. In Android 5.1 the far right was a quick launch to the phone app, but not Google wants us using Google Now voice commands instead. It's a small change, and one some might not like considering a swipe would unlock right into making a call, but not it's into Google Now and voice commands. On the bottom of the lockscreen are three icons. The middle unlocks into the phone, the right side unlocks right to the camera for quick access to instantly take photos, and on the left we have a microphone. This doesn't unlock your phone, and instead fires up Google Now voice controls. This can be used to make a call, ask for directions, "go to gottabemobile.com" and any other voice command. Some of this won't be on devices from Samsung, LG, HTC and others. You can still use this to make calls, just say, "Call Mom" rather than going into the dialer and finding her.   1 / 17 65 Responses 10/06/2015 Peter Miller Reply To be clear, in the new permissions model rogue apps can still access the internet, they just can’t access any of your data so what they can do with the internet access is severely limited. 10/07/2015 Stevenehennesse Reply gf 10/08/2015 dipak ojha Reply but my neus 5 cant show internal sd in my pc how to i can use my internal memeory like lalipop plz solution me 10/10/2015 salil Reply contact application is not working after upgrade 10/16/2015 Nandish Reply hey..even I am faciing the same issue..Any update on that? 10/12/2015 kiran Gade Reply still my device has not been upgraded in marshmallowqhen it will be get update for my device 01/08/2016 Shashi Reply after updateation any changes in internal memory 10/14/2015 heymull Reply Updated, still waiting to finish (Nexus 9 32 GB) 10/16/2015 Nandish Reply Contact app Not Working…I get a message saying contact list is updating! 10/16/2015 Winterbay Reply Now on tap removed the very useful ability to select what search provider you wanted to perform searches with.

Lollipop does indeed use vertical scrolling in both the app tray and widgets. I am on Android 5.1 on a 2015 Moto E and both the apps and widgets menu look exactly like M. Vertical scrolling is not new. Top row of apps showing recently used is not new.

For example, in the notification tray, holding the Settings gear doesn’t do anything – I held it for over 15 seconds and still didn’t get the UI Tuner. Also, the Apps drawer still has horizontal pages, and the lock screen still has the dialer rather than the voice icon, and the volume sliders are unchanged. 07/14/2016 Yumlam moji Reply Give an update for htc desire 616 dual sim from 4.2.2 to 4.4.4 please 07/20/2016 ANAND VARMA Reply Very Nice Marsmellow 6.0 good 07/26/2016 Srivin Reply Don’t upgrade to marshmallow , I’m upgrade this from lollipop , in lenovo A 7000 Now my set is not charging while system is on 08/24/2016 Table Ronde Reply The volume control looks like Lumia. 08/25/2016 NarnderVinjuda Reply Android 6.o vs and marshmallow version update to my mobile Samsung galaxy cor 08/29/2016 Ashok Kumar Reply I am having Moto G (3rd generation) mobile android 5.1, Today I updated mobile with android 6.0.

By Oliver Cragg January 11, 2017 12:19 GMT An image of Apple's New York flagship store with a green-tinted logo to celebrate 'Earth Day'.Reuters Greenpeace has released its annual report comparing the clean energy policies and commitment to renewable energy from major internet companies from around the world. Two-time chart-topper Apple once again led the pack with an 83% clean energy index. Google and Facebook also enjoyed an overall "A" ranking alongside the iPhone-maker. The report card looked less favourably on other notable tech giants, however. Samsung and Twitter were heavily criticised, while Amazon Web Services – a global cloud-computing subsidiary of Amazon.com – was reprimanded over the transparency of its policies. "Apple has remained among the most aggressive in the sector in its efforts to power its online platform with renewable energy," read the report. "Apple continues to play an important role in opening access to renewable energy new markets where it has located its data centres, such as the company's most recent data centre in Arizona." The Cupertino company was also praised for the clarity of its clean energy reporting, as well as its siting policies, with the report stating: "Since adopting its 100% renewable commitment in 2012, Apple has maintained a strong siting policy, requiring any new data centre location to have the ability to secure 100% renewable energy." Apple's Redmond rival Microsoft received a "B" grade and a 32% index score. Greenpeace note that after being "a solid C student at best" for the last two years, "new policy and commitments recently announced by Microsoft President Brad Smith have apparently marked an important shift in strategy, pointing Microsoft away from its claim that its data centres are already 100% renewable." While Facebook and Google also received pats on the back (67% and 56% index scores, respectively), questions were raised over the accessibility and clarity of reports originating from Samsung SDS - a IT-service affiliate of Samsung - and Amazon Web Services. The former received an overall "D" grade with Greenpeace highlighting a data centre in Sangam with "on-site renewables equivalent to 6% of its total electricity demand". Despite Amazon's advocacy of pro-clean energy laws, the report's lead author Gary Cook took umbrage with how it relayed details of its energy footprint: "Amazon continues to talk a good game on renewables but is keeping its customers in the dark on its energy decisions. This is concerning, particularly as Amazon expands into markets served by dirty energy," wrote Cook. Greenpeace The full breakdown (which can be downloaded here) also casts an eye over video and music streaming services, blogs and social media companies, with Netflix receiving an overall "D" and Twitter and Reddit each slapped with "F" for not providing Greenpeace or the public with any information. Cook also used the report to stress the need for all of the technology leaders listed to strengthen their stance on renewable energy in light of President-elect Donald Trump's imminent inauguration on 20 January. "In [technology markets], a much greater focus on advocacy is needed to overcome the entrenched political power of the utilities and create a pathway for the rapid adoption of renewables. This is particularly true in the United States following the election of Donald Trump, who has promised to roll back climate policies and revive the use of coal. Sustained and vocal advocacy by corporations, who recognise the ecological and economic imperative for an aggressive transition to renewable sources of electricity, has never been more important in the United States."

And it’s not just wallpapers and ringtones. With a little tinkering we can completely change the look of our phones, whether it’s through rooting, flashing a custom ROM, or installing a third-party launcher. But if you’re a little skittish at the thought of voiding your warranty and possibly bricking your phone, you can still tweak Android with a few tricks via the System UI Tuner, a feature Google has built right into Settings. You just need to know how to find it. Hide and seek When the Marshmallow preview launched in 2015, it brought a menu of customization options in Settings called System UI Tuner. It was sort of a preview of features that Google was still working on; the menu could be found under the System heading. However, once the third preview came along, Google stopped making it something you could accidentally stumble upon and changed it to a hidden menu that needs to be activated through a very deliberate process. And it's still there, hidden away from casual users. Greenbot Enabling the System UI Tuner is easy, but you need to know how to do it. First, you need to pull down the notification shade. Then, tap and hold the gear icon in the top right of the screen for a few seconds (on newer phones you’ll feel a vibration upon activation). Once you let go, the tiny cog will roll away and you’ll be taken to the Settings app and a box will appear saying, “Congrats! System UI has been added to Settings.” To get to the menu, scroll all the way to the bottom of the settings screen. In the second-to-last spot, you’ll see a new System UI Tuner option, right above the About phone tab. Tap it and you’ll open up a set of options for tweaking the interface. Different strokes While System UI Tuner is guaranteed to work on Nexus and Pixel phones, your mileage may vary with other manufacturers. Most notably there is no way to activate the menu on the Galaxy S7. Greenbot During beta testing, the System UI Tuner is filled with all sorts of goodies. Also, as is the case with any beta or developer feature, there’s no guarantee that the toggles will work properly, as evidenced by the warning at the bottom of the window: “These experimental features may change, break, or disappear in future releases. Proceed with caution.” However, it’s one of the first things we do at Greenbot whenever we get a new phone, and we’ve never experienced any real problems with it. Over its near-two-year existence, the System UI Tuner has contained a variety of options, some of which have been moved into the main settings and others that have disappeared. For example, during the Nougat beta testing, both a night mode and a dark theme could be enabled via the System UI Tuner, but only the night mode made it into the shipping version (as Night Light), while we’re still waiting for a dark theme to re-emerge. Tune-up Depending on the version you’re running, you’ll see different options inside System UI Tuner. For phones that are still on Marshmallow, there will be three: Status bar, Show embedded battery percentage and Demo mode. And in its most recent incarnation in Nougat, there are also three options, for Status bar, Do not disturb, and Other. Greenbot You can select which status bar icons you want to show inside System UI Tuner. As you might have guessed, the Status bar tab does the same thing across both versions. Tap on it and you’ll see a page of toggles representing each of the icons that appear in the status bar. If you’re tired of staring at the same icons every day, you can turn some (or all) of them off to stop them from appearing. Marshmallow’s Embedded battery percentage option (which can be found at the bottom of the Status bar tab in Nougat) lets you show how much juice you have left via a tiny number inside the icon. Marshmallow’s Demo mode might not be as useful, however, unless you’re a developer or a tech journalist who takes a lot of screenshots. All it does is strip the status bar of any notification icons and makes sure the battery icon shows fully charged. In Nougat, it’s been moved to the Developer options tab. Greenbot As its name suggests, the Power notifications toggle gives you greater control over your alerts. Power trip Nougat’s Do not disturb settings are fairly straightforward. Inside the tab you’ll find two options: Show with volume controls and Volume buttons shortcut. Turn the first one on and you’ll see a Do not disturb switch whenever you raise or lower the volume. Toggle the second and you’ll be able to quickly turn on DND by lowering the volume all the way and pressing the volume down button one more time. Greenbot When you want to turn off System UI Tuner, just tap the three dots in the upper right corner. The final option, Other, hides the setting for the most interesting UI tweak, power notification controls. Turn it on and it will add a slider to the individual app settings inside the Notifications settings. Divided into six levels, they are intended to give you granular control over the notifications you receive, from blocking all alerts to preventing full-screen interruptions and peeking. At one time, the Other tab also included toggle for enabling a split-screen swipe up gesture, but that has since been removed. That’s kind of the point with the System UI Tuner. With any given update, options can be added or taken away with nary a warning. It’s one of those fun elements that Google provides to users in the know (kind of like those cat Easter eggs), and once you activate it, you’ll likely never want to turn it off. But if you ever want to, it’s much easier to find. Just tap the three dots in the right corner and select Remove from Settings.

ADVERTISEMENT The campaign group was especially critical of Amazon Web Services, which it said continued to show a "lack of transparency" about its use of renewable energy sources to power its vast hosting business. Greenpeace also criticised Amazon for continuing to grow its business in US states that rely heavily on coal-fired power plants, such as Virginia. The report, Clicking Clean (PDF), looked at the energy footprints of large data centre operators and popular websites and applications. Highest praise was reserved for Apple, Google, Facebook and data centre firm Switch, which were taking the "greatest strides" towards 100 per cent renewable energy. Read more The elusive ruby seadragon has been caught on camera for the first time The elusive ruby seadragon has been caught on camera for the first time By Matt Burgess Subscribe to WIRED Netflix's approach to renewable energy was also a cause for concern, Greenpeace said. The streaming service accounts for one=third of internet traffic in North America, but rather than directly investing in and using renewable energy sources it is likely turning to carbon offsetting or unbundled renewable energy credits. Greenpeace's report said such an approach would "do little to increase renewable energy investment". The approach earned Netflix an overall score of 17 per cent and a "D" grade. Google-owned YouTube, by comparison, scored 56 per cent and received an "A". ADVERTISEMENT Apple scored highest on Greenpeace's green energy scale, with its operations using clean energy 83 per cent of the time. Facebook and Google received marks of 67 and 56 per cent respectively, while data centre firm Switch scored 100 per cent. Across the industry, Greenpeace found that nearly 20 per cent of internet firms had committed to 100 per cent renewable energy, but also expressed concern about the influence of Chinese technology companies who continue to lag behind those in the West. The likes of Alibaba, Baidu, Tencent and Naver, all of whom are expanding globally, fell well behind their US rivals in renewable commitments mainly due to the lack of clean energy options from monopoly utilities in China.

Most smartphone companies are either building their own AI-based voice assistants or lending it from someone else. Samsung is reportedly working on its own voice assistant named Bixby, which will be a replacement for the company’s S-Voice functionality. Google, Microsoft and Amazon have the Assistant, Cortana and Alexa, respectively, while Huawei is borrowing Alexa from Amazon. Unlike many other functionalities that are similar across smartphones, there is room for customization when it comes to voice assistants. A company can specialize a voice assistant according to its needs, so that the finished product does not look like a me-too feature. Here’s a brief look at Samsung's Bixby, Google's Assistant and Apple’s Siri: Samsung Bixby Samsung’s Bixby is based on its buyout of Viv Labs, which comprised of people who had worked on Apple Siri in its initial stages. The voice assistant is expected to feature in Samsung’s 2017 flagships, the Galaxy S8 and Note 8. Most pre-installed apps on the devices will support the Google Assistant, but Bixby will have a special focus on Samsung’s own apps such as Samsung Pay. Bixby is expected to run like other voice assistants and answer queries and perform command-based tasks. Google Assistant Google Assistant is focused more on the user’s queries. It is most importantly a replacement for physically typing your search queries and getting search results. Assistant is more conversational — it tries to answer your queries, but also evolves on extended usage. Related Stories Samsung To Launch Galaxy S8, S8 Edge, S8 Plus In 2017? What Is 10nm Processor Technology? Over time, it will get more and more personalized, picking up from your usage. Apple Siri Apple’s Siri was among the first fully functional voice assistants. Siri had some preset responses to regular search queries and could answer queries using information sourced out from Google. Siri also used to talk back to users and all its answers were in a conversational form. Over the years, as more voice assistants emerge on the scene, Siri appears to seem outdated especially in comparison to the new breed of voice assistants that power their own dedicated smart devices — while Google Assistant is an essential component of the Google Home Speaker, Amazon’s Alexa runs on the company's Echo smart speaker.

But the French government is trying to create unilateral internet policies that affect those outside French borders, setting up potential conflicts. In March 2016, French authorities fined Google €100,000 for not expanding France’s “right to be forgotten” rules to all Google users worldwide. Last week, Google announced that it would continue to fight this decision, arguing that sovereign nations should not be able to create their own internet policies. The debate over the right to be forgotten serves as a useful example of why it is time nations adopt a framework for international internet policymaking that balances their own domestic rights with respect for the global nature of the internet. The Google-France conflict arises from a 2014 court decision that ruled that Europeans have the ability to request that search engines remove links from queries associated with their names if those results are irrelevant or outdated. Google has continuously updated its compliance with the ruling to meet increasing European demands. Currently, the company delists search results for all European users based on geolocation signals, such as their IP addresses. This implementation of the right to be forgotten allows the company to remove offending results for European users, without affecting the rest of its users worldwide. Unfortunately, Google’s move was not enough for French lawmakers. The problem with making domestic laws the de facto laws for the global internet is that all countries do not share the same values and laws. For example, there is no global consensus on the right to be forgotten. In fact, critics around the world have derided the policy because of its negative impact on free speech and because the people who most stand to benefit from this type of policy are convicted sex offenders, board-sanctioned doctors and disgraced politicians who want their past indiscretions removed from the public record. Indeed, many other nations, including the United States, put a higher premium on freedom of expression and transparency than the right to hide. Actions such as France’s will inevitably lead to the creation of conflicting laws. What if, say, the Brazilian government created transparency laws that said search engines could not remove links within the country, in direct conflict with the global right to be forgotten? Which law would a search engine be obliged to follow? Furthermore, by forcing a global internet company to apply a domestic law to users in other countries without allowing those countries to decide for themselves about the merits and drawbacks of that policy, the French government could set a precedent for other countries to demand similar power. Many of these countries would not share France’s democratic values. For example, surely French citizens would not like it if the Chinese government prohibited French newspapers from publishing online stories critical of China or if African or Middle Eastern countries used their apostasy and blasphemy laws to bowdlerize French satirists. French lawmakers would rightly defend their nation’s sovereignty and say no. Rather than acting unilaterally, French lawmakers who do not like other nations’ policies should work to establish formal international agreements regarding these policies, such as a universal rule for the right to be forgotten. There are several issues, such as spam or child pornography, where an international consensus has formed that certain materials are bad and should be removed from the internet, resulting in international agreements to curb their distribution. However, when a country is unable to convince other nations to sign on to a broad goal, that country should not impose its own values on other nations and should work to limit the impact of its laws and practices to within its own borders. For example, France’s policies should not try to force search engines to delist right-to-be-forgotten links for users outside of its own borders, just as other nations should not attempt to interfere with French domestic policy as it manifests itself online. Beyond rules regarding censorship and privacy, how one country approaches internet policy can affect other countries in many areas, including e-commerce, content regulation, intellectual property and cybercrime. And while nations may not agree on goals or values, this does not mean they cannot collaborate to build a global internet system that works well for everyone. But this vision of a global internet will not result from forcing domestic policies on other countries or unfairly putting multinational corporations in the middle of international disputes. The French government should not impose the right to be forgotten on the rest of the world, and other nations should stand up to these attempts to unilaterally determine policy for the global internet. But this will only happen if Americans tell their elected officials that they do not want French lawmakers determining what they see online. Moreover, if France fails to gain consensus around this idea, perhaps this is a policy that should best be forgotten.

Many of these countries would not share France’s democratic values. For example, surely French citizens would not like it if the Chinese government prohibited French newspapers from publishing online stories critical of China or if African or Middle Eastern countries used their apostasy and blasphemy laws to bowdlerize French satirists. French lawmakers would rightly defend their nation’s sovereignty and say no.  Rather than acting unilaterally, French lawmakers who do not like other nations’ policies should work to establish formal international agreements regarding these policies, such as a universal rule for the right to be forgotten.

For example, France’s policies should not try to force search engines to delist right-to-be-forgotten links for users outside of its own borders, just as other nations should not attempt to interfere with French domestic policy as it manifests itself online.  Beyond rules regarding censorship and privacy, how one country approaches internet policy can affect other countries in many areas, including e-commerce, content regulation, intellectual property and cybercrime. And while nations may not agree on goals or values, this does not mean they cannot collaborate to build a global internet system that works well for everyone. But this vision of a global internet will not result from forcing domestic policies on other countries or unfairly putting multinational corporations in the middle of international disputes.  The French government should not impose the right to be forgotten on the rest of the world, and other nations should stand up to these attempts to unilaterally determine policy for the global internet. But this will only happen if Americans tell their elected officials that they do not want French lawmakers determining what they see online. Moreover, if France fails to gain consensus around this idea, perhaps this is a policy that should best be forgotten.  Alan McQuinn (@AlanMcQuinn) is a research analyst at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF), a leading science and tech policy think tank.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Microsoft Privacy Dashboard shows what Microsoft knows about you JC Torres - Jan 11, 2017 1 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit There are some tech companies, like Google, who are often accused of privacy violations, but it wasn’t until Windows 10 that Microsoft was put in a hot seat. The company received no small amount of flak for the gaping privacy holes in the OS it was pushing to everyone, which, in turn, pushed Microsoft to make changes to its policies and implementations. Today it is announcing yet another step forward with the launch of its Privacy Dashboard, a web-based tool that lets you see and control what Microsoft sees about you. Google released a similar web tool when it too was hounded by complaints about how it opaquely handled users’ data or didn’t give them control over it. Microsoft’s Privacy Dashboard makes a similar appeal, offering users an easy to understand and easy to use one-stop shop for managing Microsoft’s privacy settings beyond what Windows 10 directly collects. In particular, those with Microsoft accounts will be able to view their browsing and search history collected through Bing or Edge, their location activity coming from their phone PC, and their Cortana notebooks. More than just seeing, they can also clear those pieces of information should they choose to do so. Of course, Microsoft will warn them how that could affect the quality of their user experience. Microsoft particularly drew the ire of privacy-conscious people because of Windows 10’s cryptic if not hidden privacy settings and the privacy policies driving those. Microsoft promises that in the upcoming Creators Update, it will make those more private and also easier to grasp. For one, it will be moving many of the potentially invasive data collection in its Diagnostics system from Basic to Full, promising that Basic will only collect data absolutely necessary for Microsoft to properly asses the health of a Windows 10 install. Microsoft will also be changing the way it informs users of privacy settings when upgrading to the latest Windows 10, whether from Windows 7 or 8 or an older version of Windows 10. Express Settings, which skimmed over those details, will be gone, to be replaced by a more conspicuous list of settings. Unsurprisingly, by default, all those data collection settings are enabled.

Twitter Facebook France, you do not own the internet By trying to extend the right to be forgotten beyond its borders, France is interfering with other nations’ sovereignty By Alan McQuinn and Daniel Castro (Computerworld (US)) 11 January, 2017 22:00 - - - - print email Comments There is a reason it is called the World Wide Web: It is supposed to be worldwide, allowing people from all countries to use it for communication, commerce and self-expression. But the French government is trying to create unilateral internet policies that affect those outside French borders, setting up potential conflicts. In March 2016, French authorities fined Google €100,000 for not expanding France’s “right to be forgotten” rules to all Google users worldwide. Last week, Google announced that it would continue to fight this decision, arguing that sovereign nations should not be able to create their own internet policies. The debate over the right to be forgotten serves as a useful example of why it is time nations adopt a framework for international internet policymaking that balances their own domestic rights with respect for the global nature of the internet. The Google-France conflict arises from a 2014 court decision that ruled that Europeans have the ability to request that search engines remove links from queries associated with their names if those results are irrelevant or outdated. Google has continuously updated its compliance with the ruling to meet increasing European demands. Currently, the company delists search results for all European users based on geolocation signals, such as their IP addresses. This implementation of the right to be forgotten allows the company to remove offending results for European users, without affecting the rest of its users worldwide. Unfortunately, Google’s move was not enough for French lawmakers. The problem with making domestic laws the de facto laws for the global internet is that all countries do not share the same values and laws. For example, there is no global consensus on the right to be forgotten. In fact, critics around the world have derided the policy because of its negative impact on free speech and because the people who most stand to benefit from this type of policy are convicted sex offenders, board-sanctioned doctors and disgraced politicians who want their past indiscretions removed from the public record. Indeed, many other nations, including the United States, put a higher premium on freedom of expression and transparency than the right to hide. Actions such as France’s will inevitably lead to the creation of conflicting laws. What if, say, the Brazilian government created transparency laws that said search engines could not remove links within the country, in direct conflict with the global right to be forgotten? Which law would a search engine be obliged to follow? Furthermore, by forcing a global internet company to apply a domestic law to users in other countries without allowing those countries to decide for themselves about the merits and drawbacks of that policy, the French government could set a precedent for other countries to demand similar power.

Home Industry Technology Machine Learning – An idea whose time has come Machine Learning – An idea whose time has come Circa 1950: Alan Turing creates the “Turing Test” to determine if a computer has real intelligence. To pass the test, a computer must be able to fool a human into believing it is also human. Published: January 11, 2017 4:06 PM Circa 2016: Google’s Artificial Intelligence algorithm beats a professional player at the world’s most complex board game, “Go”. (Reuters) Circa 1950: Alan Turing creates the “Turing Test” to determine if a computer has real intelligence. To pass the test, a computer must be able to fool a human into believing it is also human. Circa 2016: Google’s Artificial Intelligence algorithm beats a professional player at the world’s most complex board game, “Go”. The AlphaGo algorithm, developed by Google DeepMind, manages to win five games out of five in the competition. The history of Machine Learning is, literally, encapsulated between these two developments. And now, Machine Learning – a sub-set of Artificial Intelligence (AI), where computer algorithms are used to autonomously learn from data and information, and computers do not have to be explicitly programmed as they can change and improve their algorithms by themselves – is on the verge of becoming a mainstream reality. Machine Learning draws from various fields of study – AI, data mining, statistics, optimization, and so forth. A look at the timeline of Machine Learning reveals that it is not a new concept; what is new is its relevance to our daily lives due to data explosion and greater processing power. Data explosion and mainstreaming of machine learning The increasing availability of Big Data from ever-expanding sources, including IoT sensors, digitized documents and images, has made machine learning more relevant than ever before. The data is constantly being used to ‘train’ machines and enable them to make accurate predictions and recommendations. As data continues to proliferate, the ability of our computers to process and analyze that data will also increase. Not only that, computers will also increasingly learn from that data. You May Also Like To Watch This: Some examples of the use of Machine Learning include the recommendation engines built into Amazon and Netflix services, the face recognition capabilities of Facebook, and so on. Cloud service providers such as Microsoft, IBM, Google and Amazon’s AWS unit all have launched Machine Learning services. Smart, data-driven applications are increasingly learning from past data, even as Machine Learning algorithms enable computers to communicate with humans, autonomously drive cars, write and publish sport match reports, and even find terror suspects. Other applications of Machine Learning include the recommendation systems on social media and supermarkets, streaming analytics (edge analytics, in-stream analytics), cognitive computing (such as IBM’s Watson – the question answering computer system), Google DeepMind’s WLAS tool that recently beat humans at lip reading, and so forth. Challenges and opportunities The adoption of Machine Learning in organizations is bound to face some challenges. For instance, computation of data, sourcing talent in large numbers, and creating the requisite infrastructure are going to be major tasks that will need attention and resources. Besides, uncertainty, ethical issues, outcome metrics, logistics, budgeting computational resources, training and testing of data sets all pose challenges. However, there are many opportunities as well. Machine Learning can transform enterprise data into business value, bringing intelligence and additional value to the digital enterprise. In the process, it can also change the relationship between man and machine. No wonder enterprise software vendors have been investing heavily in this area and have made it a strategic priority. Some companies have decided to eventually make all enterprise applications intelligent. SAP, for instance, is building Machine Learning on the SAP HANA Cloud Platform. Clearly, Machine Learning is here to stay. Expect further mainstreaming in the days to come. By- Prateep Kumar Guha, Managing Director, Nihilent Analytics Ltd.

Image: Shutterstock/jejim Dozens of vulnerabilities have been dealt with by Microsoft and Adobe in the companies’ early 2017 patch releases, though the former is quieter than usual. Towards the end of last year, Google revealed a problem with both Adobe and Microsoft: after a seven-day grace period while it sorted its own fix, Google waited a few days longer before it brought a serious zero-day vulnerability into the public domain. At the time, Adobe had already acted to fix the problem but Microsoft had not, and a bit of a spat ensued. It seems neither Adobe nor Microsoft want such an issue revealed like that again, with the duo releasing patches to shore up in excess of 50 vulnerabilities between them. Adobe’s patches relate to its much-maligned Flash Player, as well as its Reader and Acrobat service. The former sees 13 vulnerabilities addressed – 12 can lead to remote code execution, with the final issue potentially allowing attackers to bypass a security restriction and disclose information. The Adobe Reader and Acrobat updates deal with 29 vulnerabilities, 28 of which can lead to arbitrary code execution. None of the vulnerabilities have been known to be capitalised on in the wild, according to the company, with automatic updates taking care of most of the consumer-based workload. Flash Player v24.0.0.194 is the version users should update to, with Acrobat and Reader DC continuous users to upgrade to version 15.023.20053 and classic users to upgrade to version 15.006.30279. Microsoft’s releases cover far fewer vulnerabilities, indeed, the bulk of which are actually follow-ons from Adobe’s issues. MS17-001 resolves a vulnerability in Microsoft Edge, which could allow elevation of privilege if a user views a specially crafted webpage using the browser. MS17-002 addresses a vulnerability in Microsoft Office, whereby people could access remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Microsoft Office file. MS17-003 resolves vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player when installed on all supported editions of Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows RT 8.1, Windows 10, and Windows Server 2016. MS17-004 relates to a denial of service vulnerability that exists in the way the LSASS handles authentication requests. This security update is rated ‘Important’ for Microsoft Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2. Adobe.

Newspapers and other news producers have told a think-tank hired by the Liberal government that they need changes to copyright and tax laws. (Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press) Dean Beeby Senior reporter, Parliamentary Bureau Dean Beeby is a CBC journalist, author and specialist in freedom-of-information laws.

Those suggestions were prominent in closed-door sessions with news leaders conducted by the Public Policy Forum, a think-tank the federal government has hired to suggest policies in support of Canadian journalism during a period of digital disruption and reporter layoffs. CBC News obtained summaries of three key sessions last June, as well as an interim report to the Canadian Heritage Department, under the Access to Information Act. The final report by the Public Policy Forum is expected later this month. Its recommendations remain tightly under wraps. Reporter Sam Cooley makes his way to his car after being laid off from the Ottawa Sun on Jan. 19, 2016. Hundreds of Canadian journalists have received pink slips as the news industry struggles in the transition to a digital world. (Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press) But the internal documents show top players are pressing for federal policies that would extract money from big digital news carriers that produce little original Canadian content. "When cable companies began broadcasting, a government levy was established to help support Canadian programming," says the summary of a June 10 meeting in Ottawa. "Perhaps this could be [a] concept … applied in the digital space, establishing charges on news aggregators and foreign content producers such as Facebook, Google, Netflix and National Newswatch to subsidize made-in-Canada content." (National Newswatch is actually a Canadian website.) "Canadian policy-makers should consider whether copyright laws that govern file-sharing in the music industry could be applied in the news industry," with some arguing for a 24-hour period of exclusivity. 'Payment system' for the news industry A Toronto session on June 29 echoed the proposal. "Perhaps copyright laws need to change to make distributors better attribute content creators.... Perhaps there is a role for a … law that creates a payment system for [the] news industry." Ed Greenspon, president of the Public Policy Forum and a veteran print journalist, cautioned that the internal reports paint "a very partial picture." He declined to comment on the coming recommendations, tentatively scheduled to be made public Jan. 26. The Liberal government has been grappling with turmoil in the Canadian news industry, which has seen venerable newspapers close, hundreds of journalists laid off, Sunday editions disappear and advertising dollars migrate from legacy print outlets to digital space. 'Hobbled by falling revenues, legacy costs and lumbering cultures...' - Public Policy Forum think-tank on the state of established news media companies in Canada Critics say the disruption undermines democracy by gutting local reporting, removing journalists from legislatures and shifting money to non-Canadian news distributors, such as Google and Facebook. Meanwhile, digital news startups in Canada often lack the resources to fill the growing gap.   Or as the Public Policy Forum's interim report in July says: "Hobbled by falling revenues, legacy costs and lumbering cultures, and desperately trying to make digital inroads, established media companies have reduced their emphasis on the hunting and gathering of original news in favour of processing of existing news. "For their part, new entrants generally lack the capital, critical mass or capabilities to produce the sort of professionally based iterative journalism critical to holding public institutions to account." Ed Greenspon, president of the Public Policy Forum, releases a report later this month on what policy medicine is needed for Canada's ailing news industry. (ppforum.ca) The sessions' news leaders, the identities of whom are blacked out, repeatedly refer to Section 19 of the Income Tax Act, which since 1965 has prevented Canadian companies from deducting advertising expenses as a business cost unless they advertise in Canadian publications. The section has never been updated to cover digital ads, which means Canadian companies can deduct digital advertising costs no matter whether they place an ad with Google or with a Canadian news provider. "Section 19 should apply to new media," says a summary of the June 27 session in Ottawa. "Applying Section 19 to the internet may be possible with the current wording." Philanthropy, tax incentives proposed Among the other proposals raised in the sessions: Change tax rules to allow philanthropic support of journalism by charitable or non-profit foundations. "Under existing rules, it becomes difficult to establish the type of independent, non-profit news model that has proven so successful in the United States through ProPublica," says the interim report. Create tax incentives and exemptions to encourage coverage of local news. Investors, for example, could get special tax credits for putting money into local, non-profit digital news startups.  Review the role of the government-financed CBC, which has moved into digital news space and — according to some publishers — has undermined the private sector's abilities to attract ad dollars. (The CBC has since proposed that it abandon all advertising, relying solely on increased public funding.) The documents also show a broad disdain for direct government subsidies to the news business; a general belief that market forces should prevail; and the hope that any new policies should help all Canadian content producers, regardless of whether they are print, broadcast or digital. Winnipeg Free Press publisher Bob Cox is among news-media leaders calling for better copyright protection and changes to tax laws to encourage more Canadian journalism. (Winnipeg Free Press) "No company wants a government bailout," says the Toronto summary. "However, tools are needed to provide more balance for news organizations to compete against the large digital companies." Newspapers Canada spokesman Bob Cox says the status quo is not an option. "I've emphasized the need for some kind of policy framework in this area, lest the newspaper industry wither away without any heed to what the consequences may be," said Cox, who attended a September roundtable in Regina. The Public Policy Forum project has cost $270,000, with the departments of Canadian Heritage and Innovation, Science and Economic Development each contributing $100,000. The roundtables have included the big media firms, such as PostMedia, as well as ethnic and Indigenous newspapers, broadcasters such as the CBC, digital firms, academics and others.

Skip to content Hackaday Primary Menu Home Blog Hackaday.io Store Hackaday Prize Submit About January 15, 2017 Super Mario Run(s) — Away With Your Money 37 Comments by: Pedro Umbelino January 11, 2017 If you are an Android user and a big fan of Super Mario beware: there is no Android version! There has been no official news on the Android version yet, let alone a version of the game. There is, however, a version circulating outside of Google Play market that will steal your bank account. Right now attackers are taking advantage of the game’s popularity and Android users despair to spread malware posing as an Android version of Super Mario Run as they did in the past for Pokemon GO. The trojan is called Android Marcher and has been around since 2013, mostly targeting mobile users financial information. After installation, the application attempts to trick users with fake finance apps and a credit card page in an effort to capture banking details. The malware also locks out Google Play until the user supplies their credit card information. In this new variant of Marcher, it can monitor the device and steal login data of regular apps, not just banking and payment apps, and send the stolen data back to command and control (C&C) servers. Facebook, WhatsApp, Skype, Gmail, the Google Play store are all vulnerable. Criminals can exploit these stolen accounts to carry out additional fraud. Zscaler researchers advice is: To avoid becoming a victim of such malware, it is a good practice to download apps only from trusted app stores such as Google Play. This practice can be enforced by unchecking the “Unknown Sources” option under the “Security” settings of your device. We may add to turn on “App Verification”. Verify Apps regularly checks activity on your device and prevents or warns you about potential harm. Verify Apps is on by default, as is Unknown Sources turned off. Verify Apps also checks apps when you install them from sources other than Google Play. Of course, there is a privacy trade-off. Some information has to be sent about the apps you install back to Google. The main advice is: use common sense. It’s common practice for companies to release official apps versions through Google Play and highly unlikely to do it via any other way.

Interesting stuff. Of you can just leave a rage comment I suppose. Report comment Reply mime says: January 11, 2017 at 7:46 am I clicked on the link that was provided. I didn’t click on any of their links. In my mind an article on a website (in this case: Hackaday), should ideally contain all the information that the article is discussing. If the article requires you to do quite a bit of investigating yourself to find out what’s going on, then in my opinion it’s a bad article. Report comment Reply William DeRieux says: January 11, 2017 at 4:06 pm First of all….HackAday can’t reproduce the article because the authors would not want to be plagiarists, besides the article on zscaller already has all the information that you need in order to understand the problem. Secondly….you can’t expect HackAday to hold your hand and do everything for you — you are going to have to do work yourself (ie read). Thirdly,….anything on the Internet could be considered by someone to be some form of news — the point being that is bringing something to your attention and the question would be: ‘Would you have found the zscaller article if it wasn’t posted on HackAday’ — I suppose that answer would be no. So the intention behind this posting is perfectly vaild…. Report comment Reply mime says: January 11, 2017 at 11:50 pm Firstly, (re)producing an article is not the same as plagiarism. http://www.plagiarism.org/plagiarism-101/what-is-plagiarism/ Secondly, Hackaday is producing articles. Normally an article is a self contained story. In this case it wasn’t. Thirdly, here’s something interesting for you.

More to the point…..I don’t believe that HackADay is going to be your ‘cup of tea’. Rather…..you will probably want to take your own advice and use Google to search for the things that interest you. Until then, bye bye…. Report comment foo says: January 11, 2017 at 10:38 am I expected HAD to discuss the technical details of the app. Instead we just get a “product may contain peanuts; please remember to wear your safety belt” message and a link to the actual details.

I had to disable source verification on my work phone so it can get the Mobile Device Management apps on it, which leaves it vulnerable. I wish there was a way to tell it “These are the sources that I trust” so I can add just my company’s App Distribution server. Its not like my company being cheap or doesn’t have the resources to implement a proper store, we are a 250,000 employee company, 50,000 of which are IT and InfoSec folk, with offices in 150 countries and post $40bn USD in revenue each year… Report comment Reply fred says: January 11, 2017 at 11:36 am Yup.

Report comment Reply Len says: January 11, 2017 at 8:40 am If you take to reading sites such as hackaday via RSS it is pretty easy to filter according to your whims. I use rss2email so that all my news is funnelled into Gmail, and it is then simple to filter into categories by RSS source and drop individual entries (e.g. any hackaday post mentioning neopixel). If you want even more control over the feed it also isn’t too hard to use something like huginn to make customized filters and aggregations. (Personally I haven’t felt the need to filter hackaday but with other sites I do) Report comment Reply Eugene says: January 11, 2017 at 8:43 am Note so software vendors. When you release ‘iPhone exclusive!’ applications you land on my “do not buy anything from again” list. Report comment Reply Prodigity says: January 11, 2017 at 8:51 am I’ll be honest, I don’t like the article because it doesn’t add any value to the website in my opinion. I think it’s safe to assume that most (nearly all?) visitors to this website know that opening random files especially executables from non-trusted sources is a bad idea. The malware itself is also nothing new; it tries to steal money by posing as something else. The latter half of the article that explains how to avoid installing malware is almost insulting to the intelligence of the readers. The title would have been perfectly fine if the article had some real contents but as it stands now it’s just clickbait without substance. If anyone disagrees/agrees feel free to reply, but in my opinion this article gets a downvote. p.s. The writer has written perfectly fine articles for this site and as such this ‘attack’ is not directed to him but to articles such as these to prevent them from appearing in the first place on hackaday.

It would be nice to know if this is just another piece of credential-stealing malware like the other tens of thousands out there, or something new and unique that utilizes some unknown or unexpected infection vector (say an elaborate exploit using undocumented registers in the radio controller. From what I see, it looks to be the standard crap with the only difference being that it has Mario in it. Not much different than the Flippy Bird-based malware flooded the ecosystem not too long ago.

I’m an app developer, can’t sell anything on Android. Within hours of putting up a paid app it’s cracked and put on free download. So I have to load games with adverts to make a living.

I just don’t want Google to lurk around and watch all of my steps (allmost literally). So while I do use android, I uninstalled Play Store, Play Services, etc. That leaves me with no other option than turning the verified sources off. And use F-Droid happily ever after, combined with hopefully trustworthy apk downloader sites for the few closed source apps that I use.

The organizations on Tuesday launched the Digital Starter project, which aims, with the support of the Israeli government and the help of some 250 trained volunteers, to help 10,000 businesses in 44 locations in the country’s north and south set up websites, digitalize their activities, increase their online visibility and use social media platforms. A survey conducted by Google and Geocartography Knowledge Group in Israel shows that 8 percent of businesses set up in the periphery close every year, and those that survive grow at a rate that is 9% lower than companies that operate in the heart of the country. The 200,000 small businesses in the periphery are 40% less likely to use digital tools for growth than those in the center of the country. Having a digital presence is a very important factor in helping small and medium-sized businesses grow, the survey showed. Firms with an online presence have a growth rate 24% higher than similar companies that don’t have a presence on the internet. Almost all of the businesses in the periphery are aware of digital tools but see them as too complex to use, the survey showed. A pilot of the Digital Starter project with 250 businesses in three cities revealed that 65% of the businesses said they continue to use the various digital tools they were shown by the volunteers, and 30% of these said they witnessed a rise in the number of customers. Atidim already operates a number of projects aimed at convincing students aged 13 to 30 to study sciences and engineering to help close the gap between the center and the periphery. Atidim will provide the volunteer hours for the Digital Starter project, while Google will invest NIS 1 million ($260,000) in the venture and Wix will provide 10,000 premium subscriptions to the participating businesses. “Israeli high tech is at the forefront of international technology and I am happy it is also coming to the forefront of social action as well,” said Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon at the launch of the project at the Google offices in Tel Aviv. “Technology is a central element to the closing of gaps. If we want to connect the periphery to the future, we will do this only through technology.” An online presence can make even a small company look big on the internet, said Nir Zohar, the president of Wix.

By Natalie Gagliordi for Between the Lines | January 10, 2017 -- 19:56 GMT (11:56 PST) | Topic: E-Commerce The National Retail Federation's 2017 Big Show conference kicks off next week and so far the early news is echoing some familiar trends surrounding smart stores, inventory insight and customer personalization. What's Hot on ZDNet Microsoft rolls out second Windows 10 Creators Update test build in a week House bill aims to block tech giants from building "Muslim registry" With the rise of global instability, can ceramic storage save our digital culture? CES 2017 recap video: Big trends, top products, and wackiest tech For instance, JDA, which powers a bevy of retailers with its software, announced Tuesday that it's relying on Google Cloud for its customers' digital turn. JDA's new store optimizer technology aims to combine cloud and IoT technology to connect disparate data streams from merchandising and inventory to help reduce out of stock issues and better equip associates. In the same vein, JDA's SaaS-based Retail.me product taps into Google Cloud to leverage data science and artificial intelligence for insights into buying behaviors across customer segments. According to JDA, the platform mines point-of-sale (POS) and shopper data including purchase history, timing, frequency, and place in order to optimize inventory and maximize sales margins. The platform also lets retailers push personalized offers across channels and use real-time data to improve shipping and logistics. While JDA's software news isn't technologically groundbreaking, the Google Cloud aspect is interesting because it shows how Google is getting its AI knowhow in the field and is priming as a platform that big SaaS providers can build on. In other early NRF announcements, Posiflex and Elo are rolling out new POS and mPOS systems with expanded functionality. POS systems often go unnoticed by consumers, but the technology is critical in the most basic of ways and obviously facilitates payment acceptance. The new wave of POS devices released over the last few years have tried to incorporate more consumer-grade interfaces, software support, and cloud and data capabilities.

This is why Amazon’s Alexa is quickly gaining steam thanks to it being constantly updated with new “skills”. That being said, it seems that Google Assistant has gained at least one new skill. That new skill comes in the form of taking and sharing a screenshot. This was reported over at the XDA Developers website where some were lamenting how Google Assistant seemed to lack certain basic functionality. One of those basic functions which was present on Google Now on Tap (which Assistant replaced) was the ability to take and share a screenshot, which as you can see in the image above, has thankfully made a return. This doesn’t mean that you can use your voice to snap a screenshot, but rather the screenshot sharing button in the new interface will let users quickly grab a screenshot of whatever’s being displayed at the moment. This is versus having to press a key combination which sometimes may not work if not executed properly (for example you might accidentally end up locking your phone instead of taking a screenshot). This is a server-side update which means that you don’t need to do anything on your end to see the changes. If you don’t see it yet not to worry as it should eventually make its way to you.

The lower house, also known as the Chamber of Deputies, became the “Chamber of Rats”, using the Spanish word “rata,” which is also slang for thief in Mexico. “Our teams are working fast to resolve this incident,” Google Mexico said in a statement, explaining that place names on the online mapping service came from third parties, public sources and contributions from users. It was the second such attack in the space of a few days. Mexican media reported at the weekend that the presidential residence appeared as the “Official Residence of Corruption” on Google Maps before Google Mexico removed it from the map and apologized for “inappropriate content” created by a user. Mexico’s government has faced protests, road blocks and looting of shops since the start of 2017, when the cost of fuel jumped sharply on the back of a finance ministry decision to liberalize the market and end state-set gasoline prices. Allegations of corruption swirl constantly around the political class in Mexico. A 2013 Transparency International study showed that 91 percent of respondents felt political parties were corrupt or extremely corrupt. Some 83 percent took the same view of the legislature, the study showed. The credibility of President Enrique Pena Nieto was damaged by a conflict-of-interest row earlier in his six-year term when it emerged that he, his wife, and his then-finance minister had all acquired homes from government contractors. A government-ordered probe cleared all of any wrongdoing.

About Future Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / FactoringClub Completes Development of its Invoice Factoring Web Platform FactoringClub Completes Development of its Invoice Factoring Web Platform Posted on January 11, 2017 by Top News US Full Feed in Press Releases Conceptual image of a businessman holding big hammer FactoringClub unwraps 20 months of development work to bring its online resource to small businesses looking for invoice factoring services. With 84 invoice factoring companies in 68 cities, FactoringClub.com serves up relevant and targeted search results. Irving, TX (PRWEB) January 11, 2017 After 20 months in development, FactoringClub is taking the wraps off its unique web platform of 84 factoring company listings in 68 cities and 26 states. Each FactoringClub.com listing contains a company description, services offered, office locations, a Google map, factoring terms and contact information. The website is anchored by an advanced search engine that allows factoring prospects to quickly and easily find factoring companies by industry, state, funding size or keyword. Most Google searches don’t even list a local factoring company on the first couple of search pages. Google and Bing search results are heavily weighted to websites built and optimized with large marketing budgets. Leading search results usually have the same handful of online lenders, marketing articles, and nationwide factoring companies. FactoringClub provides factoring prospects with choices they otherwise would not see online. The web platform serves up clean, relevant search results of invoice factoring companies located across North America. “When it comes to invoice factoring, businesses are often looking for a factoring company in their location. Once they get on our web platform, they can quickly find factoring companies that interest them,” says founder Rick Hultz. "FactoringClub offers a unique, personalized experience for factoring prospects. They can focus on criteria other than location, such as company information, contractual terms, and service offerings.“ In addition to the advanced search functionality, the website provides industry, city and state directories. If a website visitor is looking for a factoring company in Seattle or South Carolina, for example, then they can quickly find only those factoring companies that have a physical presence in that location. About FactoringClub FactoringClub.com is a web platform for businesses looking for invoice factoring services. We have 84 factoring company listings in 14 industries, 26 states and 40 major cities across North America. FactoringClub also offers free consulting services.

Home FEATURED Cellphones Notebooks Gaming Tablets Software Google App Beta Hints Adding Search Gestures; Keyboard Instant Arriving for Google Assistant January 11, 2017, By Sanjeev Ramachandran Share This Related Posts Apple Rumored to be working with Carl Zeiss for its Augmented Reality Wearable Latest Preview Build of Windows 10 Arrives with a Slew of Updates Google has just unveiled its first app update in the New Year, and it’s for the beta version of its search app. The update barely introduces any new feature, but it still points to some of the big additions that could be making its way with future updates. A teardown of the coding of v 6.10.31 beta now reveals that Google is working on an intriguing ‘Search Gesture’ feature. No details have yet surfaced, but going by the name, it seems that Google is working on a feature that could pop up the search dialogue box by simply swiping on the home screen. The feature should provide a convenient mode of access to the app via the touch interface. Google Search can be invoked by speaking out the Ok Google command, but it still requires users to stretch their fingers all the way up to the Google Search bar in order to access the search window without using any voice command. While details of the new feature are yet to be known, there’s some other feature which Google has thrown more light upon. Apparently, Google will soon be introducing keyboard support for Google Assistant on Pixel devices. This very feature should be finally able to axe one big disadvantage of Google Assistant over Google Now. The app will now have a keyboard icon which will let users interact with Google Assistant not just through voice, but also by simply typing in. There’s also a text box provided along with the keyboard icon. By default, Google will be trying to communicate with you through voice commands, and users will have to tap the keyboard icon if to tryout the other available mode of interaction. Apart from this, Google has also added new settings for Android Wear 2.0 that all but confirms the imminent arrival of Google Assistant for the smartwatch ecosystem. According to Android Police, all of these new features could be made available through a new update, which will be hitting the devices soon. You can download the apk file of the beta version here to test the new beta update on your device.

Name: Subject: Message: Google Assistant update adds ability to take screenshots Newsby Scott Adam Gordon5 days ago 6 422 32 Google Assistant can now take and share screenshots as of the Google App 6.10 beta. The option was previously available with Google Now on Tap, Assistant’s predecessor, as part of the screen search function but it wasn’t carried over to Assistant. Like Google Assistant, Google Now on Tap users can press and hold the home button to deliver information regarding what’s currently on screen (albeit with a slightly different interface). They can also share that screen capture, however, meaning they don’t have to resort to the traditional multi-button press method for taking a screenshot. See also: A new version of Google Voice might launch soon 6 days ago This function now appears in the Google App 6.10 beta, so it should also arrive in the final build when it’s set live (we don’t yet know when that will be). You’ll find it next to the “send feedback” button at the bottom of the cards list after you press and hold the home button. You can then share the screenshot using any of their installed apps, though it will only work where there is text or information that Assistant can read. As such, using it to capture your home screen won’t work.

Today, Greenpeace has given Apple its top score for green internet companies, Windows 10 is getting new privacy settings, Tesla has poached its new Autopilot VP from Apple and more.

Apple scores top marks in green internet report Apple has received the highest score in Greenpeace's green energy and practices report on internet companies (TechCrunch). This is the third consecutive year that Apple has topped the charity's index, with an A grade, matched by Google and Facebook. Apple scored particularly well in the clean energy category, with 83 per cent of the electricity working its data centres coming from renewable sources. Facebook managed 67 per cent renewable energy and Google 56 per cent, with a strong performance in other categories. China's Baidu and Tencent, however, got an F grade, as did a number of South Korean firms including LG's technology services division.

Windows 10 is getting new privacy controls Microsoft has announced that Windows 10 users will be getting a new web-based privacy dashboard and updated local settings to help them control what information is shared with Microsoft (Ars Technica). Windows 10's somewhat opaque approach to user data and telemetry has been a key complaint among users since the operating system launched. However, while Microsoft is making the settings to control what data it sends home easier to find and is making them opt-in, rather than opt-out, it still won't be possible to entirely prevent Windows 10 from phoning home or to see exactly what data it's sending back. 3. Tesla swipes new Autopilot VP from Apple Tesla has revealed that its new vice president of Autopilot software will be former Apple staffer Chris Lattner (TechCrunch). Lattner was at Apple for 11 years, where he notably designed the approachable Swift programming language. Lattner's wide-ranging expertise in software development puts him in a good position to help the company complete its autonomous driving software now that all the requisite hardware is in place in its cars. Tesla said that "we are very excited that Chris is joining Tesla to lead our Autopilot engineering team and accelerate the future of autonomous driving." 4. Online messaging services face new restrictions on tracking The European Commission has proposed new legislation to ensure the stronger privacy of individuals when it comes to using online messaging services including WhatsApp, iMessage and Gmail (WIRED). Věra Jourová, Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality said the new strategy will “facilitate international data exchanges in the global digital economy and promote high data protection standards worldwide.” Under the proposal, tech companies including Google and Facebook will have to guarantee the confidentiality of their customers’ conversations and make sure to get their consent before tracking them online, something that is used to serve customers with personalised ads.

Apple's latest patent suggests an all-screen iPhone Apple has been granted a patent for "electronic devices having displays with openings" - in other words, a phone with hardware mounting points built into the display itself (Apple Insider). The design notes and diagrams suggest that the display panel would occupy the phone's entire face, incorporating speakers and other components. While there's no guarantee that any given patent will make it to a real device, it confirms previous leaks suggesting that the 2017 iPhone will be " a clear piece of glass". 6. Biologist Twitter has put together a Who's Who of the flatulent animal kingdom Having already identified the animal kingdom's best beards, the biologists of Twitter have turned their expertise to answering one of nature enthusiasts' most important questions: does it fart? (Popular Science) The conversation originated when conservation researcher Dani Rabaiotti asked biologist David Steen whether snakes fart. This rapidly spawned a surprisingly comprehensive Google Sheet dedicated to the topic, packed with intriguing - if largely uncited - tidbits such as the observation that sea anemones don't fart but suffer "awful burps" and that orangutans "do it often and have no shame". And yes, for the record, snakes do indeed fart. 7. LinkedIn and Ebay founders donate $20 million to ethical AI fund LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman and Ebay founder Pierre Omidyar’s nonprofit group have each contributed $10 million to a new fund intended to prevent the development of artificial intelligence applications that could harm society (Recode). The fund, which has a total value of $27 million, is being administered by MIT’s Media Lab and Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society, and will sponsor research into how socially responsible artificial intelligence can be designed to ensure fairness when they are used in fields ranging from education to criminal justice. MIT Media Lab director Joi Ito said that "one of the most critical challenges is how do we make sure that the machines we ‘train’ don’t perpetuate and amplify the same human biases that plague society."

Meanwhile, images from the Macro photography category capture tiny sea life in such detail that the creatures seem unearthly, with subjects including the tiny bobtail squid and colourful marine worm Sabella spallanzani. The guide says that "photographers from over 60 countries entered images, and over $75,000 in sponsor prizes have been awarded." 9. Video: Elon Musk wants better storytelling from video games In newly released outtake footage from a an interview with Y Combinator's Sam Altman, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk sings the praises of Blizzard's Overwatch and laments the lack of quality storytelling in modern games (TechCrunch) Comparing Deus Ex: Mankind Divided with the seminal design of Warren Spector's original games in the series and contemporary titles, Musk observers that in earlier games "the graphics and sound were terrible, so they had to rely on storytelling". Musk also plays Hearthstone, having been turned onto it by his kids. 10. Amazon Prime to show Studio Ghibli's first TV series 'Ronja the Robber's Daughter' The first TV series from Studio Ghibli will be coming to the UK later this month, courtesy of Amazon Prime (WIRED).

After all, Google's guaranteed two-year window for OS updates officially ended for the device in October. But while most will surely appreciate the fact that the handset is still getting new Android versions, a few of them are no doubt rolling their eyes after receiving the latest update. As Android Police reports, a growing number of people who have installed the new Android 7.1.1 update on their Nexus 6 handsets have reported the same issue: when on speakerphone, the person at the other end of the call is unable to properly hear the device's owner. Users report that those with whom they're trying to talk are hearing echoes, 'squealing' or other unpleasant noises over the line that make it impossible to conduct a conversation in speakerphone mode. Some owners said on Google's forums that rolling back to Android 7.0 resolved the problem, and described the same issue recurring if they then upgraded to Android 7.1.1. Google has acknowledged the issue and said that it's looking into it. On top of that problem, Nexus 6 owners have also faced lengthy waits for the most recent updates. After Google released Android 7.0 Nougat to many of its Nexus devices on August 22, it didn't reach the Nexus 6 until early October. And after its Android 7.1.1 rollout began on December 6, a 'last-minute bug' delayed its release to the Nexus 6 for a month.

In 2014, it was rumored to get the chop, and by the end of that year, it seemed like its days were numbered as Google folded some of its functionality into Hangouts, suggesting that the standalone Voice offering might not be around much longer. But after somehow hanging in there after all this time, it looks like Google Voice might be about to get a fresh lease on life, and it may even end up better than before. Some visitors to the Google Voice site this week were shown a banner at the top of the page, stating: The new Google Voice is here. TRY NOW It included a link pointing to https://www.google.com/voice/b/0/redirection/new; initially, clicking on that link did nothing but return the user to the existing Google Voice homepage, but the redirect has now been completely disabled, throwing up a 404 page-not-found error. But there's definitely something going on there - and Google has confirmed as much. When asked about the banner, a Google spokesperson told The Verge: Sorry, it looks like we must have dialed the wrong number! But don't worry, this wasn't a prank call. We're working on some updates to Google Voice right now. We have you on speed dial and we'll be sure to share what we've been up to just as soon as we can. Google didn't share any further details on its plans, but an update to Voice is long overdue. Its mobile apps were last updated in the second quarter of 2016, and even then, the updates included nothing but 'bug fixes'.

Fark fury follows 5-week ad ban for 5-year-old story The tale of the underage girl who wasn't and still isn't years later 11 Jan 2017 at 07:28, Kieren McCarthy The owner of Fark.com is furious at Google and wants it to reimburse him for five weeks of lost ads – thanks to a five-year-old story that featured a picture of a girl wrongly believed to be underage. Drew Curtis has taken out his anger in a blog post on the long-running news aggregation website, having been overwhelmed with the irony of having ads pulled over a pic that previously saw a man in Puerto Rico wrongly arrested. Google informed Curtis that it has identified a banned image on Fark.com and thus was pulling the ability for him to run Google ads on the site – something that resulted in a "huge financial hit" thanks to the five weeks it took to resolve. Why five weeks? Because, according to Curtis, Google's right arm doesn't know what its left arm is doing. As soon as he received the email saying he had a banned image on his site, he responded immediately, asking the obvious question: where? It took Google three days to respond, pointing out the offending image. "Our ads were turned off for almost five weeks – completely and totally their mistake – and they refuse to make it right," he rails. What's all the more bizarre is that the picture itself was taken from a news article that was all about how the picture was not, in fact, of an underage girl. Back in 2010, a man was acquitted of possessing underage material precisely because the girl was incorrectly identified as being under 16. While in Venezuela, he had bought a pirated DVD of sexy snaps of women and was stopped by customs officials in Puerto Rico because agents, having clocked her photo on the disc, thought she looked underage. It went to trial and a child psychologist testified that she had to be a child. Except, of course, she wasn't. Someone actually tracked down the girl in question and got her to the courtroom – where she revealed she was actually 19 at the time. He was cleared, and an article was written about it complete with the – to be honest, pretty innocent – image that had got him into trouble in the first place. Cut-off And then, five years later, Google decided that it was an underage girl again, pulling Fark's ad as a result. No doubt, Google's algorithms also picked up some red-flag terms in the associated article that reinforced its wrong belief that the picture was something it wasn't. But Curtis' fury comes from the fact that not only was he not contacted before the cut-off call was made, but it took him weeks to resolve the issue. "It is literally impossible to contact Google Policy without going through an intermediary," he complains. "And even intermediaries have immense difficulty contacting Google Policy. First contact with Google Policy took two full weeks." There is also another ironic reason why Fark may have been hit so hard: because the site does not engage in social media marketing and makes itself as invisible as possible to search engines, it looks suspicious to Google. After all, who wouldn't want to plaster themselves in front of as many people as possible? Curtis also claims this is far from the only time that Google has got things badly wrong. "In talking with other media companies, I've discovered that my experience is unfortunately not an uncommon one. Many other sites I've talked to have had this same thing happen to them – some have even gone under as a result. They're afraid of being blacklisted by Google so they don't talk about it publicly." And if you doubt that, consider this: despite the subject of this article being a picture of an innocent-looking girl aged 19, we are not going to add it to this article. Why? Because the risk of Google deciding again that it is somehow illegal is not worth the hassle and potential lost revenue if it does. (Yes, we carry Google ads from time to time in some regions of the world.) We suspect The Register would be able to get to Google's Policy team a little easier and faster than Fark (mostly because we know them). But even so, even just one day's delay is not worth the risk.

With an overall clean energy index of 83 percent, Apple is far ahead of second place Facebook (at 67 percent) and Google (at 50 percent). Microsoft managed a B grade and index of 32 percent, while the likes of Amazon, HP and IBM got a C grade and an index of 17 percent, 50 percent and 29 percent respectively. The worst offenders included Baidu, Tencent and LG, with the latter earning an index of 2 percent and the remainder an index of 24 percent each. Greenpeace rates companies on various factors including energy transparency, renewable energy commitment, energy efficiency, advocacy and more. Apple, Facebook and Google managed to score an A grade in at least 4 out of 5 categories. The report notes that Apple and Google “continue to lead the sector in matching their growth with an equivalent or larger supply of renewable energy”. The report also adds that the two companies have done a fair bit of work in pushing governments and other IT vendors to use renewable energy. Interestingly, the report points out that video streaming accounted for 63 percent of global internet traffic, and that the figure would hit 80 percent by 2020. Given this expected increase in traffic and the increasing need for data centres, Greenpeace is worried that just the fact that data centres have to be built, which will result in the consumption of fossil fuels, will be harmful overall. It’s also pushing for greater transparency from companies with regards to their energy consumption needs and the sources of said energy. Amazon Web Services in particular was called out for its lack of transparency. South Korea is also in dire need of “advocacy for renewable energy”, says the report. Almost all the energy in the country comes from fossil fuels, after all. This is reflected in the report, where South Korean companies like LG and Samsung have among the worst ratings in the list. Greenpeace claims that the IT sector alone accounts for over 7 percent of global electricity consumption, going so far as to call data centres the “factories of the digital age”.

The credibility of President Enrique Pena Nieto was damaged by a conflict-of-interest row earlier in his six-year term when it emerged that he, his wife, and his then-finance minister had all acquired homes from government contractors.

New data released Tuesday shows sales of smart home hardware and services are expected to hit $83 billion this year, according to market research firm Juniper. That number is expected to more than double in the next four years, rising to $195 billion by 2021. The companies slated to lead the charge are Alphabet (Google's parent company), Amazon, Apple and Samsung, according to Juniper. The market research firm dubbed those companies the "Big Four" and said they'll "further solidify their positions" as leaders over the next few years. Smart home hardware and services covers a gamut of categories, including entertainment, automation, health care and connected devices. The fastest-growing areas over the next five years are expected to be home automation and smart appliances, according to Juniper. Such devices in those categories would include Google's smart speaker and assistant Google Home and Philips' Hue Wireless Dimming Kit that lets people use an app to dim their lights and turn them on and off.

By Lara Rebello January 11, 2017 05:14 GMT Close Protests continue in Mexico as thousands rally against fuel price hike Reuters Unhappy with the current state of corruption in the political class in Mexico, pranksters changed the name of the lower house of Congress on Google Maps. The location's name was altered from Chamber of Duties to read "Chamber of Rats", using the Spanish word 'rata' which is also slang for thieves. "Our teams are working fast to resolve this incident," Google Mexico said in a statement, explaining that users were allowed to make changes to the names of places on the online mapping service. Over the weekend, Mexican media reported a similar attack in which the presidential residence was also renamed on Google Maps. The new title which read "Official Residence of Corruption" was immediately removed and the tech company released a statement apologising for the "inappropriate content". Mexico has been facing growing unrest since the start of 2017 when the government increased the price of fuel by 14% to 20%. The finance ministry has decided to liberalise the market and end state-set gasoline prices. Following the announcement, thousands of Mexicans took to the streets to protest the hike and have demanded the resignation of President Enrique Pena Nieto. Demonstrations turned violent and at least six people were killed in clashes with the police. Policemen are deployed as protesting continues in Mexico CityRonaldo Schmidt/AFP There have been allegations of corruption against the Mexican government and the political class. According to a 2013 Transparency International study, 91% of respondents felt political parties were corrupt or extremely corrupt, while 83% took the same view of the legislature.

Photo: Carlos Avila Gonzalez, The Chronicle Move over, App Store: Startup looks for new way to distribute apps 1 / 3 Back to Gallery When iPhone users want to download apps, they mostly go to a single place: Apple’s App Store. The store is the gatekeeper for apps, ensuring they meet Apple’s standards for quality and ethics. But over the years, it’s been challenging for apps to get noticed among the millions in the store, and some people find it too cumbersome to spend minutes searching for and downloading new ones, only to delete them later due to lack of space on their phones. Venture capitalist Ernestine Fu aims to solve that problem. Her firm, Blackstorm Labs Inc. of Mountain View, sells technology that allows developers to distribute their apps without going through the App Store. Instead, the apps are available through links that consumers can send to their friends. “The time is right for the App Store to be disrupted,” said Fu, Blackstorm’s co-founder. Blackstorm Labs, which launched last year, has raised $33.5 million in funding. It is looking for alternative ways to distribute apps not just from the App store, but also from the Android equivalent, the Google Play store. The numbers are huge. Consumers spent $3 billion in December at the App Store, and Apple takes in as much as 30 percent in app sales for those that are distributed through its App Store. The App Store generated nearly double the amount of worldwide revenue compared with the Google Play Store in 2015, according to a report by App Annie, an app analytics firm. Photo: Carlos Avila Gonzalez, The Chronicle Blackstone employees raise their hands to agree to do a "Secret Santa" during a meeting at the Blackstorm headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., on Wednesday, December 14, 2016. Mountain View-based Blackstorm creates software that it licenses to companies so that the firms can embed their apps within other popular apps like Facebook, without having consumers download an additional separate app though a cumbersome process through the Apple App or Google Play stores. Blackstone employees raise their hands to agree to do a "Secret... Blackstorm wants to get a cut of those sales, plus provide an avenue where developers can reach consumers faster because they don’t have to download an app. It plans to make money through its technology by either charging a licensing fee or a percentage of an app’s revenue. Apple and Google did not return requests for comment. Blackstorm in November released a game called EverWing on Facebook’s Messenger app, letting users challenge their friends by sending them an invitation. Users click on the invite within Messenger to play and don’t need to download the game through the App Store. EverWing was one of a handful of games allowed on Facebook’s platform and was noted by the company as being one of the best instant games in 2016. Blackstorm has a studio where it can create its own games, including EverWing. Amitt Mahajan, a managing partner at Presence Capital, said he believes this type of technology “has a lot of promise,” especially when it comes to games. It makes sense for people to release games in the places where they are talking about them, such as a chat message. “That’s more akin to the real world,” Mahajan said, adding that it’s natural to start playing a board game at someone’s house, as opposed to downloading a whole different app to start playing a game. Other companies are also preparing for a future beyond a store for apps. Chinese firm Tencent told media outlets this week that its popular messaging app WeChat has a new feature that allows people to search for programs and add them within WeChat without going through the App Store. Google last year discussed Android Instant Apps at its developer conference; these would allow consumers to click on links and pull the minimal amount of information they need from an app without having to download the whole thing. “The app should be available instantly,” as quickly accessible as a Web page, said Raheel Hasan, CEO of 1App, a Menlo Park startup that plans to distribute apps through links. 1App charges developers a fee for using its service that lets them distribute apps outside of the App or Google Play stores. Users click on a link that allows them to stream apps instead of downloading them. Hasan declined to say how much the cost to developers was, but said it is a percentage based on app purchases or use and is generally less than what Apple and Google charges developers.

When apps go through an approval process through Google or Apple, the companies make sure the apps meet their quality standards and policies. “I would be concerned about viruses, malware and adult content,” said Jordan Edelson, CEO at Appetizer Mobile, which develops mobile apps. Both 1App and Blackstorm say they take security very seriously. Hasan said 1App would approve apps that haven’t yet been sold at the Google Play or App stores by reputable developers. In a way, 1App could be a way for a developer to test an app in the market without having to go through a lengthy approval process. “You have to change how people get to apps,” Hasan said.

The initiative will first hit the Detroit Institute of Arts using the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro.  ( Google ) Advertisement This early, Google's Tango is already proving to be quite useful even with the dearth of AR apps for the two devices currently supporting the platform. The company announced Jan. 9 that it is partnering with museums around the world to bring enhanced experiences through the use of the AR technology. The initiative will first get implemented in Detroit Institute of Arts through a dedicated app developed to offer visitors AR tools when viewing pieces being exhibited. The app called Lumin is going to bring AR interactivity and a new approach to providing information at DIA. For this particular museum, the project will be using the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro, which will be available at the front desk. Google Tango In Museums If you are curious about the so-called enhanced experience, Google has cited specific examples that demonstrate how Tango can enrich interactions inside the museum. Take the case of the Egyptian mummy. Using the Tango-enabled device, visitors will be able to peer behind its bandages, revealing a fully preserved skeleton presented virtually. There is also the 3-by-4-foot mosaic that was once part of Babylon's Ishtar Gate. Using this piece as a point of reference, the Tango app will be able to show visitors the scale of the structure, which used to stand six stories high. (Photo : Google) Finally, Google touted how Tango can bring the Mesopotamian limestone relief to its appearance thousands of years ago. When the decorative element was made, it was painted in different colors. Using Tango, visitors will again see how they must have looked like in their past glory. AR vs. VR Based on the examples outlined, one should already recognize the AR's difference from virtual reality. The technology is bringing virtual objects into the physical world. This means that all content are confined to the smartphone screen, a variable that could prove to be a disadvantage when compared with virtual reality, which places its user right in the middle of the virtual world itself. However, companies are now reportedly building AR glasses that could make AR content consumption as immersive as VR. As more compatible devices roll out, developers are expected to produce more AR apps that could help bolster the viability of the platform. Meanwhile, Google — with its collaboration with various museums — seems ready to pull all the stops to get consumers to experience augmented reality despite existing constraints. As was previously mentioned, there are currently two devices supporting Tango today, and one of them, the Asus ZenFone AR, is yet to be released. This should could be rectified as OEMs start releasing compatible devices in the future. Google's push in this particular museum initiative was demonstrated through its vision of AR-enhanced exhibits it showed off last February during the Mobile World Congress. "This is just the beginning of how you'll be able to use Tango in museums to see more, hear more and learn more," Google said.

Once present functionality like recognizing songs or verbal podcast controls have yet to make their way into Google’s new interface, but it now appears that screenshot functionality is making a return. Screen search (previously Now on Tap) on non-Pixel devices continues to feature a system Share button that allows users to take a quick screenshot. This is convenient in that it doesn’t require users to press the more cumbersome physical key combination. With Google Assistant, the Screen search interface has been changed, with results slightly different and more basic. Appearing to rollout via a server-side update, there is now a new ‘Share Screenshot’ button next to ‘Send feedback’ and underneath the list of cards. To quickly access the button and avoid waiting for cards to load, users can swipe up to have Google Assistant take up the full screen. Tapping it features the same animation as before and pulls up the system menu to share the screenshot with any app. Notably, ‘Share Screenshot’ only appears when Assistant has information to read. As such, users cannot take screenshots from the homescreen.

TrustedReviews Facebook Twitter Googleplus TVs & Audio Cameras Computing Mobile Home appliances Gaming MWC 2017 GPS & Sat Nav Mobile Apps Mobile Phone Accessories Mobile Phones Tablets Wearables & Fitness Trending: CES 2017 Apple Watch 2 iPhone 7 Galaxy S7 vs iPhone 6S Google Pixel Galaxy S7 Home / News / Mobile Phone News / Android Nougat usage doubles, but adoption is still embarrassingly low Android Nougat usage doubles, but adoption is still embarrassingly low by Chris Smith 10 January 2017 0 shares Read Comments The Android Nougat operating system, the seventh major version, is now running on 7 in every 1,000 Google-based devices. The newly-outed Android distribution numbers for January make more grim reading for Google, especially given Nougat was released earlier than usual, in August 2016. Those handsets running 7.0 have hit 0.5 per cent, almost doubling last month’s tally, while 0.2 per cent of device owners are on Android 7.1. The latter represents Google Pixel users, suggesting there was no mad rush to snap up the Made by Google handsets over the festive period. Related: Android 7.0 tips and tricks The situation may improve in the coming weeks and months with Samsung, LG, Moto, Sony and HTC plotting roll-outs for their flagship devices. Also, the forthcoming Mobile World Congress expo should see a wealth of handsets launched with Android 7.0 out of the box. So far, the Pixel phones and the LG V20 are the only major handsets to launch carrying the latest version. However, updates and new handsets are unlikely to see the number of phones running Nougat immediately skyrocket. Within today’s distribution numbers, 2015’s Android 6.0 Marshmallow still sits at 29.6%. 2014’s Android Lollipop (versions 5.0 and 5.1) still leads the way, installed on a combined 33.4% of Android phones. Head-to-Head: Are the Google Pixel phones overpriced? Does having the latest version of Android matter to you? Or are the differences too few to even notice these days? Share your thoughts below.

See your own article on Windows 10 updates. "Obnoxious" if I recall correctly. I am unanimous in that January 11, 2017, 4:04 am It would be useful if tablet makers actually got round to updating their products with the latest version of android but presumably they would rather sell you a new tablet. Google need to be a bit more proactive to encourage to do the former Jeff Penver January 11, 2017, 10:47 am I don't really understand why they didn't standardise the android models so the same update can be sent as-is to every handset. Phil January 11, 2017, 1:00 pm My girlfriend had a tablet which got updated to the latest version of Android and it basically bricked it. The whole thing ground to a halt and became unusable. There is an argument for keeping devices on the version of Android which they were optimised for, especially older ones as the OS will become more demanding as the average device specification improves over time. In the case of that tablet, it must have never been tested or it would never have been released - it wasn't an isolated problem. Anyone who updated seemed to get a useless tablet in return with no easy way of rolling back (unless you're an uber, l33t nerd which most of us aren't). It might have been a way of forcing people to buy new tablets but I wouldn't buy from that company ever again if that was the case. Phil January 11, 2017, 1:02 pm Far too complex - it would require practically identical models or an OS like windows with a huge driver database and maybe even going back to the days of a hardware abstraction layer. Standardisation to that degree would basically make it pointless having different manufacturers and competition would evaporate as they'd be all the same except for the casing. Phil January 11, 2017, 1:04 pm Indeed. If you're willing to accept the security risk (many people are as they don't do anything really secure on their phones) and don't care about feature updates there's a fine argument for not bothering updating. Microsoft are trying to avoid making the same mistake as Google and want to keep everyone at the same level which is fine until they do things like bricking printers with updates and so on.... ...which they routinely do. Printers, network adaptors, etc etc. Phil January 11, 2017, 1:05 pm The other issue is it takes "Apps" a while to catch up. Only recently have many, even well known apps, been optimised for Android 7.0. No point in having the latest OS when the whole point of a smartphone is the Apps and you can't use half of them or they don't work properly. jeff the chef January 11, 2017, 5:15 pm I don't wait for carriers to release updates anymore. If you have a computer, just adb sideload it when it comes to XDA. sao_paulo January 13, 2017, 12:11 am Google themselves have to take some of the blame. My Sony Xperia Z3 is capable of running Nougat, as shown by various ROMs & it was even chosen to run the Developer Preview version. But will now not get officially updated for not meeting some of their obsure requirements for Nougat. Seeing as the phone runs perfectly for me still on Marshmallow, so it will stay for me.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 11 January 2017 | MYT 11:57 AM Italy looking at Google proposal to settle tax dispute: source In hot soup: A year ago Italian tax police alleged that Google had evaded paying taxes worth €227mil (RM1.07bil) between 2009 and 2013 in a move which was said could result in heavy punitive fines. — Reuters MILAN: Italy's tax authorities are looking at a proposal from Alphabet Inc's Google to pay between €270mil (RM1.27bil) and €280mil (RM1.32bil) to settle a tax dispute, a source close to the matter said.  A year ago Italian tax police alleged that Google had evaded paying taxes worth €227mil (RM1.07bil) between 2009 and 2013 in a move which was said could result in heavy punitive fines.  Governments across Europe are looking for ways to change tax rules which allow multinationals to park profits in other tax jurisdictions.  Some countries, including Italy, are also trying to use existing tax rules to force companies to pay more tax on the profits generated by sales in their countries.  At the end of 2015 Apple Inc agreed to pay Italy's tax office €318mil (RM1.50bil) to settle a dispute over allegations it failed to pay taxes for six years.  "There was a meeting with Google's lawyers just before Christmas when the proposal was presented", the source said.  But sticking points to a final settlement include working out final details on how revenues are booked for tax purposes and securing a commitment from the US giant to pay taxes in Italy in the future, the source added.  "Google is continuing to work with the competent authorities," a company spokeswoman said.  In January last year Google agreed to pay the British government £130mil (RM708.29mil) in back taxes in a deal which opposition parties in the country criticised as too little in view of the size of Google's UK revenues. — Reuters Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Corporate News , Government , Technology , Taxation You May Be Interested Boosting women's libido Glass discards now included in waste separation law Better rates via online forex services Paying high interest rates for personal loans Purple should be your favourite CNY colour Chinese herb Dang Shen helps to boost strength Others Also Read Title is beyond Man City after Everton loss, says Guardiola Barn owls here to stay Do we really need to fear China money? advertisement Latest News Sci-fi tech set for 2017 Only World Group slides early Friday on outlets closure QLED vs OLED Trading ideas: DneX, Leweko, Gadang, OWG CIMB Research retains Underweight on auto sector, favours Bermaz Most Viewed in Tech PCs on the rise Dell Vostro 14: Value for money Could your gadgets send you to jail?

Open-sourced, TensorFlow can be used by any developer to add machine learning to apps and other services. Internally, Google uses it for image recognition in Photos and to converting audio to text in Cloud Speech. Modern SoCs are composed of several components, including a digital signal processor (DSP) that can more powerfully and efficiently process audio, video, and other tasks than a CPU or GPU. On the Snapdragon 835, Qualcomm worked with Google to ensure that TesnorFlow efficiently runs on the Hexagon 682 DSP. In one test, a TensorFlow app designed to recognize real-world objects placed in front a camera is loaded onto two devices. The phones are identical save for one running the app on the CPU and the other on the Hexagon DSP. The app running on the DSP is able to recognize, analyze, and come to a better conclusion on objects than the CPU one. Specifically, the DSP has better accuracy by being able to capture more frames per second, while being milliseconds faster and more confident at identifying objects. These results are promising as machine learning is ultimately integrated into more and more services. Devices running the Snadragon 835 are expected to launch in the first half of 2017.

He added it will be difficult for China's foreign trade to improve in 2017 due to rising costs and other factors. China is the world's largest trading nation. It could be heavily exposed to protectionist measures this year if Trump follows through on campaign pledges to brand it a currency manipulator and impose heavy tariffs on imports of Chinese goods.

The Wall Street Journal. 2:10 Legal experts: Trump's business plan falls short CNN Money 3:21 UP NEXT SAN FRANCISCO — Is Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer a failure? Or was she just handed a Sisyphean task? "Both," says Aswath Damodaran, professor at New York University's Stern School of Business. "She was given the impossible job (of turning around the troubled Internet pioneer). But at the same time, she took it on, said she would change things, and failed." As Yahoo's dismantling proceeds — Verizon is still on track to buy its digital assets for $4.8 billion while the remaining Alibaba-invested company gets renamed Altbaba — questions arise about both the tenure and future of the Google-trained white knight that had promised to ride to the rescue.  On the one hand, under Mayer, 41, Yahoo stock soared 180% since she was named CEO in 2012, from $15 to $42. "If my broker could do that for me every time, I'd call him a genius," says Michael McDermott, professor of business management at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business. "Given a very difficult if not impossible situation, I'd say she did OK." Mayer was in many ways brought in to right a sinking ship. She was Yahoo's seventh CEO, a list that included former Warner Bros. executive Terry Semel "who couldn't even be bothered to move to Silicon Valley from Los Angeles for the job," says Paul Saffo, longtime tech world observer and forecaster. "The company was in such chaotic shape (when Mayer joined) that you would have needed someone with the temperament and intuition of Steve Jobs to even have a chance at a turnaround," says Saffo. "Her biggest mistake might have been taking the job. It was a suicide mission."  But on the other hand, everything from repeated hacking scandals, ill-advised acquisitions such as the $1.1-billion purchase of social media site Tumblr and high-salary but underutilized hires such as Katie Couric and former New York Times tech columnist David Pogue all point to a spotty chief executive tenure that could stain Mayer's resume. © AP Photo/Julie Jacobson, File Marissa Mayer "Her flaw was that she should have recognized a few years ago that she was throwing good money after bad, and if she'd done so she would have likely got twice what she's getting now for Yahoo assets," says Damodaran. In fact, Yahoo's stock topped out at nearly $52 in the fall of 2014. "But, ultimately, people are human," he says. "You offer someone millions to take a job, and of course they're going to say yes." Tech world watchers echo a few similar refrains when asked about Mayer and her Yahoo tenure, namely that she was noticeably lacking in the kind of experience required to take on the challenge and that, in the end, the job required a borderline genius. While Mayer had been an early employee and fast-rising star at Google, "she had no experience as a CEO, and being a tech company CEO requires deep intuition about where things are going. Like when Jobs said everyone has a phone with a stylus, but we're not going to do that," says Saffo. Yahoo was founded by Jerry Yang and David Filo in 1994 as a curated guide to the burgeoning World Wide Web. Yahoo's homepage was among the first true online sources for news. But Google's arrival signaled a sea change for search companies, one that placed a priority on the power of algorithms over curation. "Marissa was sticking with Yahoo's DNA and hiring big names, but that was never going to help in the battle with Google," says Saffo. Making matters worse was an internal culture that seemed to create tension and the wrong kind of competition between layers of vice presidents. In the past few years, Yahoo was hit by a number of lawsuits from male employees who claimed they not only were discriminated against, but that all managers were forced to stack-rank their employees for the purpose of incessant firings. Mayer and her team "were just not very good at listening, and in any turnaround you have to do an awful lot of listening," says Rita Gunther McGrath, a professor at Columbia Business School. "That wasn't her strong suit." While Yahoo was a "basket case" upon Mayer's arrival, McGrath notes that among the CEO's poor decisions was one "to go around her own cyber security team," a move that ultimately led to more than a billion users having their information hacked. On Monday, a Securities and Exchange Commission filing revealed that Mayer, who will have earned more than $300 million as Yahoo CEO and should receive $55 million if terminated, will be stepping down from Yahoo's board of directors along with five others when the Verizon sale goes through. Mayer will not be on the new Altbaba company's board, and there is only speculation as to what the executive could do next. Just how much her Yahoo misadventure will taint her career is also a subject of debate. "Was there a lot of hubris in her time at Yahoo, of course, but sometimes hubris can pay off," says Damodaran. "I could imagine some small tech company snapping her up as CEO. She's had experience in that position now, and in many ways tech companies like hiring big names." Saffo believes that things might not be so simple. Despite some efforts, Silicon Valley suffers from a reputation as being a predominantly white and male enclave, with few minorities and women in executive positions and in crucial investor roles. "Marissa took on an impossible mission, and you can't criticize someone for being a risk taker," he says. "But Silicon Valley has a bit of a double standard when it comes to women. So, will she be judged as a risk-taker who failed, or as a woman who failed?" Mayer also could be about to head off the Glass Cliff, a phenomenon first identified by two British professors who found that companies are more likely to appoint women and minorities in leadership roles when the firms are not doing well. “When things are dire, boards somehow think that bringing in a woman will be better for team building, because they’ll listen better and have better social intelligence," says McDermott. "Then they get fired because of performance or because the business model can’t be turned around. And then the company brings in a tough guy."

(Photo : Alexander Hassenstein/Getty Images) Google Chrome users can easily download most web pages and videos for their offline viewing pleasure. These guide and tips are applicable to Android devices loaded with Chrome. How To Download Web Page In Chrome First open the Google Chrome browser and load the web page intended for offline reading. Hit the three dots which are located at the Chrome Windows upper right side. It opens a menu but the download icon is at the top situated in between the information and bookmark icon. In case the icon is nowhere to be found, it's time to update your chrome browser. Downloading web page for offline is the only alternative for those travelling without Internet access, according to Fizure. Note that the download is only applicable per page, for multiple pages download each separately. For offline viewing, pull down the notification bar which is at top most part of your device's screen. Once there, you can hit the notification message for that particular download. Another way is to launch the Chrome browser again. Hit the three dot icon again but this time Select Downloads and choose the desired offline web page. How to Download Video In Chrome Open the Google Chrome browser and load the video you selected for offline viewing. Play the video then tap and hold it. A pop-up message will appear with the words "Download video". Tap it to begin downloading. There are two ways to view it offline. Pull down the notification bar and tap the notice message that says the video has been downloaded successfully. The second way is to go back to Chrome and tap the three dots. From there choose Downloads and select the video you want to view offline. Unfortunately, YouTube videos are exempted from this download method, according to PC Advisor. This is curious since its videos are the most popular. Google owns YouTube but it's not willing to share its video for offline viewing. The only possible explanation for this is piracy fears on the part of the video owners and YouTube.

The latest protest changed the name of the parliament to the ‘Chamber of Rats’.

The lower house, also known as the Chamber of Deputies, became the “Chamber of Rats”, using the Spanish word “rata”, which is also slang for thief in Mexico. “Our teams are working fast to resolve this incident,” Google Mexico said in a statement, explaining that place names on the online mapping service came from third parties, public sources and contributions from users. Mexico protests: how gas prices lit the flame under a quietly smoldering rage Read more It was the second such attack in the space of a few days. Mexican media reported at the weekend that the presidential residence appeared as the “Official Residence of Corruption” on Google Maps before Google Mexico removed it from the map and apologized for “inappropriate content” created by a user. Mexico’s government has faced protests, road blocks and looting of shops since the start of 2017, when the cost of fuel jumped sharply on the back of a finance ministry decision to liberalize the market and end state-set gasoline prices. Allegations of corruption swirl constantly around the political class in Mexico. A 2013 Transparency International study showed that 91% of respondents felt political parties were corrupt or extremely corrupt, while 83% took the same view of the legislature. The credibility of President Enrique Pena Nieto was damaged by a conflict-of-interest row earlier in his six-year term when it emerged that he, his wife, and his then-finance minister had all acquired homes from government contractors. A government-ordered investigation cleared all of any wrongdoing.

Roston - Jan 10, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Google Voice, the company’s seldom mentioned VoIP service, is going to be on the receiving end of some updates soon. News of the updates first arrived via a link some users were seeing when they visited Google Voice. The link and notification encouraged users to click to see the new Google Voice, but the related web page isn’t live at this time. Having accidentally revealed its efforts, Google has since confirmed that yes, it is working on some new updates. If you’re a Google Voice user, you may have noticed a small banner at the top of the screen recently reading, “The new Google Voice is here. TRY NOW.” The Try Now part of the banner is a link leading to https://www.google.com/voice/b/0/redirection/new, but if you follow the link, it just presents a 404 page. It seems pretty obvious regardless that Google is up to something, and questions quickly started rolling out. In a statement to The Verge, a Google spokesperson passed along this corny message: Sorry, it looks like we must have dialed the wrong number! But don’t worry, this wasn’t a prank call. We’re working on some updates to Google Voice right now. We have you on speed dial and we’ll be sure to share what we’ve been up to just as soon as we can. The company is remaining quiet about what it is actually up to, though, so it’s anyone’s guess what features we’ll be seeing soon. Any update will be a welcomed one, however, as it has been a long while since Google Voice was given any love, and any news is surely good news at this point.

The company was awarded an A for its continued usage of renewable resources and for pushing governments, utilities, and other vendors it works with to do the same. The report puts a particular focus on the internet and the energy consumption associated with the data centers and servers that power it. Commitments by Google, Apple, and Facebook to use 100% renewable energy four years ago have caused over 20 internet companies to join in the effort. In terms of clean energy usage, Google is rated at 56%, with the company still relying on 14% natural gas, 15% coal, and 10% nuclear to meet its consumption needs. Broken down into several categories, Google received top marks in all but one area. The company was given a B in Transparency for not providing an energy demand or energy mix for its cloud facilities. This is problematic in that it does not allow consumers to make informed decisions. While ahead of competitor like Microsoft and Amazon, it is still behind Apple and Facebook. Google received an A for Renewable Energy Commitment & Siting Policy, with Greenpeace applauding the company for staying green while rapidly expanding its Cloud Platform around the world in the past year. In terms of Energy Efficiency, Google’s use of machine learning to optimize data center operations gets a nod and results in driving significant saving gains. Meanwhile, in Advocacy Google has been “actively engaging in important policy debates.” In the US, the company has been very active at the state-level, while sponsoring energy tracking programs throughout Asia where the infrastructure is lacking.

By Tas Bindi | January 11, 2017 -- 00:55 GMT (16:55 PST) | Topic: Innovation Seattle-based startup Mighty AI, recently rebranded from Spare5, has raised $14 million in a Series A1 round led by Intel Capital, with participation from new investors Google Ventures (GV) and Accenture Ventures. Existing investors Foundry Group, Madrona Venture Group, and New Enterprise Associates also contributed to the round. Founded in 2014, Mighty AI pays subject matter experts to fine-tune artificial intelligence (AI) engines so they can see, hear, talk, and "think" like humans. Businesses that are looking to use AI technology, but don't have the datasets required to set up effective AI software, are able to acquire the right datasets to train and scale their computer vision and natural language models.

CES 2017 recap video: Big trends, top products, and wackiest tech "In the future, we will count on AI to make every aspect of our lives better," said Mighty AI founder and CEO Matt Bencke. "But, for AI models to do all this and more, they need to understand what and how we think. Mighty AI is the critical link between computer and human cognition, putting the right humans in the right learning loops." The new funding, which adds to the $13 million previously raised by the startup, will be used to extend its so called "Training Data as a Service" platform and community of "Fives" -- a network of more than 100,000 individuals who conduct microtasks in their spare time, such as identifying and labelling objects in images or doing sentiment analysis of text. Mighty AI will also use the funding to expand its team of data scientists, engineers, and product, sales, and marketing professionals. In addition, Mighty AI has signed agreements with Intel and Accenture that will see the companies recommend and sell the startup's training data services to their customers globally. The agreement outlines that Intel and Accenture's customers will have access to: Infrastructure such as the chips Intel builds; mathematical algorithms that process large amounts of calculations in parallel to "think"; training data that turns these blank slates into simulations of human knowledge; and the application of the resulting AI models in interfaces that make it easy for people to use. "As our CEO, Brian Krzanich, has said, AI is not only the next big wave in computing; it's the next major turning point in human history," said Doug Fisher, Intel Corporation senior vice president. "Intel is investing in AI, with the goal of driving breakthrough performance while making AI solutions more accessible and easier to deploy for all ... To produce high quality data for training models to deploy, it is essential to obtain clean, accurate human annotations at scale." In addition to artificial intelligence, in November 2016, Intel Capital announced that it would be investing more than $250 million over the next two years to help make fully autonomous vehicles a reality. Krzanich said at the time that data is the new oil and pointed to several ways autonomous cars will collect data, such as cameras, radar, sonar, GPS, and LIDAR. It's projected each vehicle will generate around 4TB of data a day. "You could say oil is the key technology that allowed the automotive world we know today," Krzanich wrote in a blog post at the time. "When it comes to the car of the future and automated driving experiences, however, data is literally the new oil. Data has the potential to radically change the way we think about the driving experience." Accenture has also been increasing its focus on artificial intelligence. In May 2016, it formed a new business unit in partnership with IPsoft focused on spurring adoption of AI in the enterprise. Meanwhile, Google created a new research group dedicated to artificial intelligence in mid-2016 in line with its CEO Sundar Pichai's AI-centric strategy. In April that year, Pichai said he foresees a time when devices will completely vanish, to be replaced by omnipresent artificial intelligence, and that the company's investments in AI are preparing it for such a world.

A computer’s operating system, the layer of software between you and the hardware, has changed remarkably over the past few decades. At the beginning a user had to interact with levers and switches, then came screens and DOS, the Apple’s Macintosh and Microsoft’s Windows, and, finally, the internet. These slowly wormed their way into our lives and changed the way we do almost everything. But the OS of the future is going to be something different entirely. The next step is artificial intelligence, and there’s a land rush going on. Just think of how profitable Microsoft’s control of the previous epoch was. How operating systems evolved In the 70s, many of us cut our teeth with command line systems like MS-DOS, CP/M and Unix. Just imagine the black screens with green type. You could type almost meaningful commands like “cp” to copy a file. This was pretty geeky, but a little less than physical switches. In the 80s, computing moved over to graphical interfaces like Mac OS and Windows where you could simply point and click. Want to delete a file? Simply drag it into the bin. What could be simpler? Computing was no longer just for geeks. Almost anyone could do it. In the 90s, computing became more connected. The internet took off and the browser became king. Indeed, Google have made a whole Operating System out of this, Chrome OS. And more recently, computing became mobile and moved onto apps on our smartphones. Some of these apps and services started branching out, creating their own little worlds to bring together developers and users. There is probably no better example than the Chinese app WeChat, which has thousands of applications, from social networking through buying airline tickets. You might not realise it but the next revolution in Operating Systems is now under way. And the technology giants like Microsoft, Apple and Google are racing to be the winner. The new race Late last year Google announced a series of hardware products. There was Google Home speaker, Pixel smartphone, and the virtual reality headset Daydream View. But Google isn’t going to make billions out of hardware like this. Software is a much better business to be in. It scales so much more easily. No, Google is producing this hardware just as a means of getting its AI-based Google Assistant into our homes and our pockets. Assistant is baked into all of these products, and through it, Google wants to be at the centre of our lives, however we connect. READ NEXT: AI is about to hitch a ride in your car Conversational assistants like Assistant and Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa are the Operating System of the future. No more typing. No more pointing. The power of Artificial Intelligence will be harnessed to serve our needs. “Get me on the next flight to Canberra, Google”. “Who’s the President of Switzerland, Siri?” “Play me that jazz saxonophist that I like, Alexa.” In many cases, there won’t be a keyboard in sight. We’ll walk into some new room and say “Turn on the lights” and expect someone will be listening. Sorry, something will be listening. We’ll sit it our car and simply announce “start the ignition”. We’ll get into a lift and command “top floor, please”. We’ll walk into the bathroom and say “run me a bath”. Screens will disappear. In its place, will be conversations. Conversations that will follow us from room to room, to car, to office and to bed. The knock-on effects of all this will be huge. The loss of screens will mean digital advertising must be rethought. The rise of conversation will impact search and online networking. Whoever wins the race to define this new operating system will take the lead in all of this. Winners and losers This is an exciting future. There are plenty of opportunities for the bold. To build a watch that doubles as your personal assistant. Sunglasses that tell you when you’ve had too much sun. A weighing scale that offers advice about your diet. The likely winners are companies like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, or Amazon because they are the first movers, and the theory of network effects mean their products will likely rapidly improve. The likely losers are privacy, diversity and democracy. The NSA can’t wait for every room to be listening. Marketers can’t wait to see all this data on our everyday lives.

The lower house, also known as the Chamber of Deputies, became the "Chamber of Rats", using the Spanish word "rata," which is also slang for thief in Mexico. "Our teams are working fast to resolve this incident," Google Mexico said in a statement, explaining that place names on the online mapping service came from third parties, public sources and contributions from users. It was the second such attack in the space of a few days. Mexican media reported at the weekend that the presidential residence appeared as the "Official Residence of Corruption" on Google Maps before Google Mexico removed it from the map and apologized for "inappropriate content" created by a user. Mexico's government has faced protests, road blocks and looting of shops since the start of 2017, when the cost of fuel jumped sharply on the back of a finance ministry decision to liberalize the market and end state-set gasoline prices. Allegations of corruption swirl constantly around the political class in Mexico. A 2013 Transparency International study showed that 91 percent of respondents felt political parties were corrupt or extremely corrupt. Some 83 percent took the same view of the legislature, the study showed. The credibility of President Enrique Pena Nieto was damaged by a conflict-of-interest row earlier in his six-year term when it emerged that he, his wife, and his then-finance minister had all acquired homes from government contractors. A government-ordered probe cleared all of any wrongdoing.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Voice may be receiving a long, overdue update soon By Ida Torres - January 10, 2017 1 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter After reading the headline, your first reaction may have been, “What, there is still Google Voice?” But yes, the tech giant may not have been paying much attention to the telephony service that lets you do voice and text messaging, as well as call forwarding and voicemail services. An unintentionally (or so they say) leaked banner on the website showed that they may be readying for a long, overdue update, the first time in what seems like forever. People who still visited the site were surprised today when they opened it and saw a web banner saying, “The New Google Voice is Here). However, It didn’t lead to anywhere except the old version of the page and eventually, Google said that while they are indeed working on updates to the service, the banner was accidentally released but it wasn’t a very advanced April Fools’ Day prank. They did not give details as to what the updates will be, but given the fact that they already have a ready banner that was leaked, then this may be sooner rather than later. Previously, the features of Google Voice and Hangouts tried to merge, but it didn’t really click. All of the Voice features are in Hangouts now, and so people continued to use the apps to make voice calls and all. But now that Hangouts is being transitioned to focus more on enterprise accounts (the Hangouts API is shutting down later this month), then there might be room for growth and improvements in the Voice service. Allo and Duo have been released by Google recently, setting them up as the company’s default messaging and voice app, respectively. Now as to where Google Voice will fit in this digital ecosystem (at least in the US where Voice is avaialble) remains to be seen.

Attackers are exploiting misconfigured open-source MongoDB databases and holding them for ransom. The ransomware attacks against MongoDB were first publicly reported by GDI Foundation security researcher Victor Gevers on Dec. 27, 2016, and have been steadily growing ever since, with at least five different groups of hackers taking control of over 10,000 database instances. Among the most recent groups to join the MongoDB ransomware attack was one reported on Jan. 6, by security researcher Nial Merrigan. The MongoDB attackers are only identified by the email address that is used to demand payment. The new group identified as 3lix1r@mail2tor.com, has already compromised at least 17 MongoDB instances and is demanding 0.25 Bitcoin from victims to get the data back. The amounts being demanded by attackers vary from a low of 0.15 Bitcoin up to a full Bitcoin. Bitcoin has fluctuated in value so far in 2017, and as of Jan 6, is worth approximately $892 USD. The U.S. Department of Labor has sued Google for allegedly failing to submit compensation information on its employees as required under equal opportunities hiring practices laws. The lawsuit filed with the Labor Department’s Office of Administrative Law Judges seeks to bar Google from bidding for government contracts until it provides the requested data. The Labor Department complaint also calls on the court to issue an order canceling all of Google’s existing government contracts and subcontracts unless the company complies with its obligations. The dispute stems from what the Department of Labor described as a routine request for employee compensation data from Google as part of a random audit of the company’s compliance with relevant employment and hiring laws. However, in a statement, Google denied that it was resisting the government's request to turn over the data to the Department of Labor and said that its actions were based on the fact that the requested data was far too broad and intrusive. Security firm Netsurion is launching its first new services since acquiring security information and event management vendor EventTracker in October 2016. The new SIEM-at-the-Edge and Breach Detection Services expand Netsurion's product portfolio and bring advanced threat detection and mitigation capabilities to small businesses and branch offices. Netsurion CEO Kevin Watson explained that the new services are two stages of a similar concept. The basic idea behind both services is to collect network information from end-points and then provide alerts on events that are potentially problematic. Events could include items such as the installation of a new executable on a system and different user behavior patterns. In total, Watson said that there are 32 different alerts that can be triggered based on detected events. AT&T, in a race with competitors Verizon, Time Warner and others to build a go-to internet of things development franchise, has selected international security provider Gemalto to handle its remote subscription management processes. Gemalto, the world's largest provider of enterprise digital security software and services, is now supplying AT&T with a package that will enable its customers to deploy new and highly secure internet of things applications in the U.S. and globally. The companies made the announcement Jan. 4 at CES 2017 in Las Vegas.       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows Google Open Sources Data Visualization Tool for Machine Learning Cisco Security Business Group Continues to Accelerate Growth Amazon Go Won't Kill Many Jobs, But It May Prove a Boon to Crooks Microsoft, Harman Kardon to Take on Amazon Echo, Google Home Yahoo Suffers New Hack; 1 Billion Users Impacted This Time 10 Things T-Mobile Has Done to Move O...

That’s a win for Google since older versions of Android are often unsecure and provide a bad user experience, especially for budget phones that many people buy without being aware of what OS the phone is running. This short one-minute video takes us through every single major and minor Android version release and you’ll quickly notice a few things as you go through it. Google was committed to Android 2.3 for quite a while with several small version updates that are still registering on the version distribution charts to this day.

Brian Stoffel (TMFCheesehead) Jan 10, 2017 at 6:09PM Saying that you're going to buy a stock and never sell it seems a bit audacious. And in truth, it is: The future is simply unknowable. But I've owned shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)(NASDAQ:GOOG) -- formerly known as Google -- for almost a decade, and I can't fathom a circumstance under which I'd consider parting with my shares. Image source: Google Canada. Currently, shares of the company make up a whopping 13% of my family's real-life stock holdings. But we're totally comfortable with that allocation. Here's why: 1. The company's flagship product has a dominant market (and mind) share If you're sitting around the dinner table arguing about a provable fact, you resolve the dispute by simply "Googling" the answer. The fact that the name is so embedded in our lexicon speaks volumes to the search engine's dominance. According to Statista, Alphabet's Google search owns 90.4% of the global market on desktops. And perhaps more important, according to NetMarketShare, it commands 93.8% of the mobile search market share globally. 2. It boasts six other products with over 1 billion users But as you're probably well aware, Google is much more than just search. It has six other applications with over 1 billion users. These include Gmail, YouTube, Google Maps, Chrome, Android, and Google Play Store. 3. That all adds up to a lot of data "Sure," you might say, "but the company doesn't charge for most of those products. That's not great business." Image source: Getty Images. While you'd be right, you'd be missing out on what's dubbed the "oil of the information age": data. With every user in all seven of those aforementioned apps, the company is able to collect gobs of data. In fact, I don't think it would be too hard to argue that Google has more data on the people walking this earth than any other organization, at any other time in human history. 4. At its heart, it is still an advertising company That data is worth billions to advertisers. In the old days, companies would try to target their audience by putting ads in magazines or newspapers where potential customers might be lurking. But the feedback loop wasn't great: Advertisers never knew just how effective that ad spending was. Not so anymore. With Google's advertising platform, companies get real-time feedback on how efficiently their ads are being placed, and how much business they produce. Given the data hoard that the company has, ads placed through Google can be more targeted to the perfect customer than any other available source. That's a huge moat for the company. It also helps explain why Google advertising brought in $67 billion in sales last year for the company, or 90% of all revenue. 5. Digital ads are poised to grow If you think you've missed the boat, rest assured you haven't. A March 2016 report from eMarketer shows that there's still a lot of room for internet advertising to grow. Image source: eMarketer.  And with TV still retaining one-third of the global market share in 2019, I can only imagine that the runway for internet ad growth will continue for much of the next decade. 6. The company is more than a one-trick pony Back to that name change, from "Google" to "Alphabet." You might better understand the reasoning if you look at the new corporate name as "Alpha-Bet." This rendering of the name reflects the company's practice of taking a lot of moonshot bets on revolutionary technologies outside its main search and data-capturing business. This is what famed trader, academic, and thinker Nassim Taleb would call a barbell approach: having a large a reliable stream of revenue on one side while taking lots of small bets on the other. While the likelihood of any one moonshot succeeding is small, all it will take is one or two winners over the next decade to make a meaningful difference for shareholders. What are these moonshots? We probably don't know all of them, but the ones we do include self-driving cars, a connected home, a life sciences company, and lightning-fast internet connection. 7. Its mission statement is memorable I'm a sucker for a good mission statement. When it is clear and powerful, it can be the compass that helps guide management and employees alike toward a common goal. Google's mission statement is: "To organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful." The mission of new-formed parent company Alphabet is multifaceted but can be broken down to: "Getting more ambitious things done[,] ... empowering great entrepreneurs and companies to flourish ... [and] as a result of all this, improving the lives of as many people as we can."  Those are both powerful and flexible enough objectives to keep the company relevant in a quickly changing world. 8. It has soul in the game Lest you think that you might have a few executives who are in this for short-term gain, Alphabet is still run by its co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Together, they -- along with all of the other company executives and board members -- own almost 48 million shares of Alphabet, and account for 60% of the company's voting power. To put the number of shares in perspective, it is equivalent to almost $40 billion at today's prices. 9. The proof is in the culture Another metric that's often overlooked is a company's culture. If Page and Brin really do want to accomplish the ambitious goals they've laid out, they need a stable and motivated workforce to get things done. To get an idea for the company's approach, a 2010 filing with the SEC stated that "[monetary] incentives are secondary to career growth, work environment, and engaging work opportunities. We seek to develop a highly motivated and collaborative workforce that pursues achievements for the sake of progress and innovation before individual gain." Based on employee reviews on Glassdoor.com, I'd say the company is doing pretty well. Image and data credit: Glassdoor 10. There is lots of cash to make it work Finally, if you've got a company that's going to be taking lots of small bets that can be costly, it's good to know that management is sitting on a pretty expansive war chest. And that's what you get with Alphabet. Long-term debt: $3.9 billion Cash, short-, and long-term investments: $88.8 billion This, and the other nine reasons above, helps me sleep well at night knowing my family is invested in -- and likely won't sell for a long time -- such a company.

Not all advertisers are receiving this notice, only those whose landing pages prominently feature a phone number. Google will pull the phone number from the landing page and include it in the advertiser’s mobile ads as a call extension. Google is taking the liberty of making this change by default, while emphasizing that mobile search is predicted to drive 19% more calls to businesses than using landing pages alone. However, there are several reasons why advertisers may not be in favor of this change. Some may not want to pay for calls being placed to their business through mobile search ads, and some may not even want to encourage phone calls if they’d prefer to capture leads in otherwise. If for whatever reason, you do not want call extensions to be automatically added to your mobile ads you will have to opt out manually. You can opt out by following these steps: Navigate to the Ad extensions tab Select “View: Automated extensions report” Scroll down to “Automated extension options (advanced)”, then click on “Edit” Select the option that says “Do not use specific automated extensions for this account” If you’re in favor of having call extensions automatically added to your mobile ads then you can simply do nothing and let the change take effect when it rolls out next month. If you already have call extensions in place, then this change will not affect you at all.

Google Transit, a real-time bus and railway tracking feature in the Google Maps app, officially launched in Taiwan on Tuesday. Now instead of just seeing bus and metro choices in the Maps app, you can see the bus's estimated arrival as reported by the transit operator in real time. Google said the transport information service would provide commuters with nationwide railway data feeds. In the initial roll-out, the feature will be available for use in five major cities: Taipei, New Taipei City, Taoyuan, Taichung and Kaohsiung. Coming Soon to More Cities Near You Google said its developers would continue working on adding new transit options and cities for the new feature, with Tainan City among the regions to support Google Transit in the next round. With the added feature, whenever users type in their place of departure and destination point, the system will run calculations and show them public transport routes and required waiting times. The company said this tool would help users who rely heavily on public transport to more efficiently plan their trips. A How-to Google presented an example to show new users how to use the new service. For a user that seeks to use Google Map to search for the best route from Taipei 101 to the National Palace Museum or from the Taiwan High Speed Rail Zuoying Station to E-da Theme Park, they only need to type those locations into the Google Maps app for a route suggestion. Users will see bus options, how long each route will take and when the next bus will arrive. Time until arrival will be displayed in green, unless the next bus or train has been delayed, in which case it will turn red. Google said currently public transportation information is supported by Android devices, iPhones and the website version of Google Maps. Currently, Google Maps boasts over 1 billion active users around the world and provides real-time traffic data feeds in 100 countries. Google said that its Maps app had more than 1,000 credible information sources. These sources include open data and commercial graphics, such as satellite, aerial and street view images. The firm said that it would continue to update its features to provide a more comprehensive and convenient map service.

Google Voice is getting an upgrade Posted Jan 10, 2017 by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story Chelsea Peretti returns to host the 10th Annual Crunchies Awards Google’s somewhat aging VoIP calling service, Google Voice, is preparing to roll out a significant update, the company has confirmed. Several Google Voice users this week reported seeing an upgrade link touting “the new Google Voice” on the web version of the service, along with a link that would let them try it out. Clearly, the message was posted too early because the upgrade didn’t come through when the link was clicked. However, its existence has been an encouraging sign for Google Voice customers, many of whom have felt as if the service has been abandoned in favor of Google’s many newer efforts in the communications space, including Hangouts, and more recently, messaging apps like Allo and Duo. According to the Droid Life blog, which was one of the first to see the upgrade link appear, the banner popped up at the top of the screen when they logged into their account, with a message that read: “The new Google Voice is here. TRY NOW.” But when they tried it, the page just refreshed and they remained on the current user interface. Google Voice hasn’t been updated in some time, making the product feel a bit been abandoned. Many are saying it hasn’t had any attention in years, but that’s not entirely true. It didn’t receive much attention in 2016, but before that, the last notable updates have included things like Google Hangouts’ integration with Google Voice back in fall 2014, and 2015’s update which improved Google Voice’s voicemail transcriptions.  Still, its updates have been few and far between, despite the usefulness of the service and its potential. Google’s failure to continue investing in the space has allowed other voice calling apps the ability to gain ground. Not only are voice messaging apps a popular category today, the idea to give users the ability share a public phone number that can ring them anywhere, on a line that has its own voicemail and filtering options, is now something other startups, like Burner or newcomer Listen, are handling instead. These Google Voice rivals have succeeded in part by focusing on mobile users – an area where Google Voice has fallen behind, having not updated its iOS and Android apps since the first half of last year. After the flood of reports, Google confirmed that it’s working on some updates to Google Voice, but declined to give us further details ahead of the launch. Google’s strategy with regards to its communications apps has been messy, so it will be interesting to see what the new Google Voice entails. The company has a number of communication products, which seem to be in a constant state of flux. Hangouts, for example, has just seen its API shut down, which will effectively shutter the app ecosystem on the platform for most developers. The apps that were allowed to remain have an enterprise focus instead, as Google explained to developers in an email that it’s moving away from its consumer focus.

However, this new feature is not going to be available to everyone just yet. For now, only those who have the beta version of the Google app will have access to the shortcuts.  On Monday, VentureBeat reported that the beta version of the Google app for Android has been updated with shortcuts to certain widgets. Since the shortcuts are displayed on the Google Now home screen, they appear on top of the cards below the Google search results bar.  Users who have the Google beta app can access the shortcuts in two ways. First, they can launch the Google Now home screen by tapping inside the Google Search box widget on their home screen. The other way is by simply swiping right from the home screen on any of their Pixel smartphones.  Related Stories Google Shuts Down Google+ Hangouts API Apple iPhone 8 Launching With iPhone 4-Like Design? Apple Rolls Out iOS 10.2.1 Beta 3 Amid iPhone's 10th Anniversary The shortcuts are only present in version 6.10.35 of the beta app. The different widget shortcuts available as of this time include weather, the calculator, nearby restaurants, Solitaire, nearby ATMs, Tic Tac Toe, a coin flip, My Events and nearby coffee shops. The list of displayed shortcuts is updated real-time based on the shortcuts users frequently launch.  One can also access the full list of these widget shortcuts by tapping the View All button at the end of the row of shortcuts. The shortcuts are categorized into the following: Nearby, Tools, Travel, My Stuff, Entertainment, Weather and Fun.  All of the features that now have shortcuts can be accessed by manually searching for them. However, this update on the Google Now home screen makes it easier and faster for users to launch them. Sad to say, the widget shortcuts are only available to the Google beta app for Android. Search Engine Land says they are not found on the iOS equivalent of the app as of late.  Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.
