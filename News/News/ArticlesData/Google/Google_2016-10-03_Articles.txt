AUSMEPA’s project, the Port Emissions Portal, addresses the current lack of essential ship emissions data for the shipping industry. Utilising satellite tracking and a big data approach, the platform will enable ports and their stakeholders to measure air quality and changing air patterns throughout the port environs. “AUSMEPA’s clear mandate is to protect Australia’s maritime environment, and one of the biggest challenges we are facing is climate change. This is not just a local issue, however action has to start at a local level. With shipping’s exclusion from the COP21 global agreement on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, we are taking a leading role in providing the industry with effective solutions” said AUSMEPA Chairman, Capt Warwick Norman. Starting in Australia and scaling up to over 170 countries, AUSMEPA’s port emissions portal plans to connect over 3,000 ports and improve the knowledge of air emissions associated with shipping activities in port. As part of an international community of MEPAs (Marine Environment Protection Associations) Capt Norman said AUSMEPA’s plan was to work with their international counterparts to provide a locally-initiated, global solution to shipping’s contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. AUSMEPA could be one of four organisations to receive a $750,000 grant to further to assist in developing the port emissions portal. The six additional finalists will receive $250,000.A judging panel will select three winners, and a fourth will be selected based on public voting, which is open from 4 – 25 October via www.go.co/australiachallenge. Alan Noble, Google Australia’s Director of Engineering, said “We know good ideas combined with technology can help to solve some of the world’s biggest challenges. Ten Australian non-for-profits have been selected as finalists in the latest round of the Google Impact Challenge for their outstanding ideas to use technology to make an impact on important causes. ”AUSMEPA are encouraging all maritime industry stakeholders around the world to support their initiative and vote for increased transparency and improved knowledge of air emissions caused by shipping activity in ports:www.go.co/australiachallenge.

Kara Swisher: Today in the red chair is someone I've tried to get here for a long time, it's someone I've known for a very long time: Bill Gurley, general partner at the venture capital firm Benchmark. He's invested in companies ranging from GrubHub to Zillow to Uber and serves on several board[s] of directors. Before he joined Benchmark in 1999, Bill worked at Compaq and spent four years as a tech analyst on Wall Street. Bill, welcome to the show. Bill Gurley: Thanks for having me. We have known each other a long time. Very long time. I knew you as an analyst, I think. Yes. I don't know if I knew you at Compaq, because I didn't cover Compaq. But I did cover, I remember, the CEO at the time. There's so much to talk about; I think people know you really well here in Silicon Valley, but some of our listeners don't. So walk through how you got to Benchmark. I wrote the story when you went to Benchmark, if you recall, in 1999 for the Wall Street Journal. You had been at another venture capital firm. How far back do you want me to go? Well, how did you get into [being a] tech analyst? Let's start with tech analyst and Compaq. I had a computer engineering degree in undergrad, and my sister was a double E [electrical engineering major] out of Rice and was employee 63 at Compaq, so I was exposed … Wow. Where did you grow up? In Houston. So yeah, of course. My father was in the space program, worked at Johnson Space Center. And Compaq was there, right? In Texas. Yeah, and her going through that obviously brought a lot of exposure into our family of being at a startup, and she was given options. And Kleiner was an investor. Oh yeah. I wouldn't have expected to have that exposure that early in my life. I also — like everyone you've probably had in this chair — had a Commodore VIC-20 and used to code out of magazines and stuff like that. I ended up at the University of Florida where I rode the end of the bench on the basketball team and got a comp sci degree. I went to Compaq, where I'd spent some summers, and worked there for a couple of years, and I found I was drawn to a broader calling. I started work on the third PC and it looked a lot like the second and the first. What did you do? I worked in a team that did problem solving. So when a new computer was coming to market, they'd put it into test and it would fail. And my team, we'd get thrown in a room with a logic analyzer — Like, "why isn't this working?" Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it was fun. It was fun. This was the '80s, right? Yeah, this was '89 to '91. I remember AOL was on that one computer ... I can't remember. They were all small computers. I had a Prodigy account when I was working there, and I used to trade stocks. I ended up going to business school and then I started trading stocks — Borland went public during that time. And so this combination of being fascinated with technology, looking for a broader thing to do, and then getting interested in investing and tech and disruption, that kind of thing. So I went to business school, I thought about trying to get into venture at business school. I went and met with some Austin Ventures people who said, "Kid, you're way too young, go get 20 years of work experience." Right, because they had operators. That's what they said, yeah. Which is ironic, and I can come back to that, based on how we choose people at Benchmark now. But anyway, while I was at business school, everybody cracks open every Fortune and Businessweek and they read everything because they want to think they are professional business people. And so I was reading about all these amazing analysts at Goldman Sachs at the time, Dan Benton and people like that. And Rick Sherlund. And they were always quoted, like, opining, and I just got interested in it. You wanted to opine. Yeah, I went to Wall Street and just knocked on doors. Like cold, like what you read about. And got very lucky that [Credit Suisse] First Boston gave me an opportunity. Right, which was a big deal at the time. And then two weeks after I joined, Charlie Wolf was there covering PCs, and he announced he wanted to resign and back off. So I went into my tiny little apartment with no air conditioner and wrote a 20-page assessment of the PC industry. What did you tap away on? I don't remember, probably some kind of luggable. I'm thinking Kaypro, perhaps, around then. Trash-80. And I went in and begged for Charlie's job, and was very fortunate. Not only did Charlie share with me all his models, but two of the other ranked analysts, David Course and Dan Benton, who still comes to your conference every year, they gave me all their models and they've all left the field. Oh, where did they go? Dan and David when to the buy side and Charlie went into academia. They just like got out. "We're leaving." Wasn't that a signal to you? "Uh oh, I better get out of here?" It couldn't have been more fortunate, right? Because I moved up through the ranks very quickly. It's an opportunity. That's somewhat how I got my job at the Washington Post. People retired or left. So that was a big event. And then the other big event was at Stewart Alsop's conference, which Charlie helped me get into. Which was the big deal, Agenda. Oh man, you're standing at that first dinner, and there's Bill Gates and Larry Ellison and all this stuff, and you're like, "I'm just a nobody, this is crazy." But anyway, one of those first few years, they were selling a Palm Pilot. And it had the attendees’ contact information in it. Ahh, aren't you clever. And I had just started this newsletter called "Above the Crowd," which was a fax at the time. And so I was just like, "Oh wait, this is too easy." So I paid like $200 for this Palm Pilot and I spammed everybody … … with "Above the Crowd." It was a great newsletter. The most important people in the technology industry. Yeah, you've always been a writer. We'll talk about that soon. It came from the analyst days, because I had to write big, long reports. Absolutely. But they used to write reports a lot better then. There was a lot of people, you know, Mary, you, even Henry Blodget wrote some fantastic stuff, though it didn't end so well for him there. So then — I should hurry this along — so after three years of doing that, I was getting burned out. It's a tough job being an analyst. And I was thinking about going to the buy side and, in fact, had been interviewing with Capital Group in LA ... Right, that's Gordon Crawford. ... who I still have a ton of respect for. And Frank Quattrone called me ... out of the blue, and he had left Morgan Stanley on, I think, Good Friday in '96. We ended up sitting down and he said that he'd like me to join their new firm. And I said, "You know, I'm kind of burned out on this analyst thing." And he said, "Well, what do you want to do, long-term?" And I said, "I'd love to be a venture capitalist." And Frank said, "Why don't I move you to Silicon Valley? You can cover any sector you want, and I'll introduce you to every venture capitalist I know." Well, that's an offer. Yeah. What did he do, take your soul? [BG laughs] Frank kind of looks satanic, so did he say, "You must ..." You know, there are people that are super loyal to Frank and I'm one of them. And when someone makes a commitment like that and helps you get your dream job … And you worked for them. Yeah, I did. And we were very fortunate. We were lead-left on the Amazon IPO, which would be a famous trivia question one day. "Who took Amazon public?" Frank was in the middle of all this. Or else buying and selling companies. He was involved in a lot of that during that time. Yes, and [Jeff] Blackburn was the banker that worked alongside me who then went to Amazon. Before we get ahead of ourselves, what was that period like? Because I was here too. I remember these things. And at the risk of sounding aged, it really was an exciting time. Well, for me, it was my real first exposure to Silicon Valley. I'd been out here a couple times as a PC analyst, but the PC industry wasn't really centered in Silicon Valley. No, it wasn't. IBM and Compaq, and even AST was in Irvine. And Gateway was in Sioux Falls. So I didn't travel here all that much, and then I was just suddenly put here. Because internet, that's why. And by the way, that's the sector that I asked Frank that I wanted to cover, and of course I knew nothing about it, so I went and bought all those TCP/IP books and stuff, which I don't think helped me at all, but I read them anyway. And it was super exciting, you know? And I knew a few people. Like when Frank called me, I called [Roger] McNamee because he had been at T. Rowe, so he was someone I had known from the buy side. And there's a few others like Glen Kacher and some of the Tiger guys. So I called Roger and I said, "I don't know Frank." He's like, "Take his meeting immediately. You have to. This'll get you to Silicon Valley." So it's been great. Roger's always been someone that I've called along the years to help me think through decisions. Yeah, it was so exciting. Like I remember one of the first meetings was in a train caboose for CNET with Halsey [Minor] and Shelby [Bonnie]. And I knew nothing about media or advertising. Right. That doesn't stop many people. And Halsey was just remarkably upset that I wasn't getting it faster, and Shelby, God bless him, was just super calm and casual, bringing me along and teaching me. That was interesting. He used to call me in the middle of the night because he was like, "Why is my story on [page] A22 of the Wall Street Journal and Yahoo's on the front?" Or whatever. And I said, "You're lucky you're on A22, because I got you on A22 or else you wouldn't be there at all." But that didn't end well for Halsey. No. But I've stayed in touch with Shelby. I consider him a wonderful gentleman. Yeah. So then you shifted over to venture capital. I was with Hummer Winblad for 18 months and then came to Benchmark. So that was a big deal, I remember. That was like, gaaah. Like, "You left there?" And they were shifting at Benchmark at the time. Yeah, two weeks after I announced the Hummer Winblad position, Andy Rachleff cornered me at a conference and said, "Dude, why didn't you call me?" And quite frankly, I would have to say I was so fixated [on] being a venture capitalist [that] when someone started to ask me, I'd say, "Yes!" Yeah, take the first date. And they were a well-known firm. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I'm still very close friends with John [Hummer]. I think the cultural fit with Benchmark is just [better]. Yeah. I remember tall, white guys, essentially. Well ... Come on. I sat across from them when they were talking about eBay. When someone approaches you that works for an equal partnership … because everyone else that's working their way into venture starts at the bottom with only a piece of the action, you’ve got to work your way up. Someone else's name firm. It's a pretty compelling offer when someone comes and says, "We want you to be one of us." Absolutely. And you were the tallest of all those tall men. But it did cause reverberations. Everyone was sort of talking, I remember, it was a big deal because you were sort of the bright young thing at the time. Well I guess now that I've been here something like 16 or 17 years, it's probably the right place. Yeah. And it was changing also. It was starting to shift. To a certain extent, the beginning of my venture career was a little bit like being near the top of a roller coaster: Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch. And then it just slammed down before I ever had a chance to really establish myself and build a track record. This was the end of the first internet bubble. And when I first arrived at Benchmark, it was like, "Nothing can go wrong." There was an IPO every week. And they had done eBay. And then, wham! Man, the door came down hard. So what was that like? Because you do write a lot about bubbles. You're like the worrywart of Silicon Valley. And we'll talk about that in the next section. But what was that like, as an early venture capitalist, when you have that happen to you? It's intimidating. I mean, I think for anyone that breaks into venture, years two, three and four, unless you're as lucky as, say, [Matt] Cohler with Instagram or Roelof [Botha] with YouTube, are just anxiety-ridden. People use the metaphor of children: You basically have a bunch of middle-aged teenagers with acne that are awkward and clumsy. And you haven't proven anything. That's if you do early-stage. And so it's a gut check. And it's really helpful — at least it was helpful for me at Benchmark with the equal partnership — there's just this kind of team orientation where, if you feel like you're struggling, people are getting beside you. Yeah, because they all have a stake in it. Yeah, they have a stake in you doing well. It's not an eat-what-you-kill kind of situation. Not at all. So what was your investment? My first investment at Hummer Winblad was a company called Employease, which was SaaS HR. Ah, early. Way before its time. It was like Workday, 10 years early. Or Zenefits. I was just visiting their offices. Very similar. Because we didn't charge the same way, but the same customer set. But it was the beginning of that idea. And ADP ended up buying it for 150 [million]. But we didn't make nearly as much money. And we made a huge mistake by choosing HR instead of sales, because HR is a corporate purchase by someone who doesn't have any authority. And sales is a credit card purchase by someone who has all the authority. So, hard lesson. So you did that. And what was your first at Benchmark? What were you involved in? It was Epinions. Epinions, oh my god. Was that a success or a failure for you? We ended up merging it with Dealtime, it went public, and eBay bought it for $600, $700 million. Yeah, so you feel good about that. But that was a hit company, and then sort of not. It was. It was covered in the New York Times Magazine, and then the bubble burst and then there was a founder split and … Explain Epinions for people who don't know. I remember you on the covers. It was always on the covers, that guy. Epinions was a big UGC idea at the beginning of the internet, which was basically to allow UGC reviews of anything and everything. And they started in the categories more like products. They did experiment with services. And the CEO was? The CEO was Naval Ravikant. Naval, yeah. That's right. An interesting story about him: We ended up splitting from him and there ended up being a lawsuit. And this was, I don't know, 16, 17 years ago. I'd always thought of Naval as one of the smartest people I'd ever met, but when someone sues you, you tend to get on the other side of things. And just this past winter, I was at a ski event that Chris Sacca put together, and he was invited and we sat down and talked for the first time in [ages]. Oh wow. And? It was great. Hugged it out? Yeah, it was awesome. It reminded me of why we worked together in the first place. But I regret that we spent 16 years not chatting. And he's obviously gone on to do some spectacular things. In the next section, we're going to talk a little bit about your philosophies, what you write about, because you write about bubbles and things like that. But what was your philosophy on investing then? What were you doing in the early days? And we'll talk later about how it changed. I think when I was on Wall Street. just devouring any book I could in investing philosophy — I think I bring a structured approach. You're almost academic in the way you think about it. And the way I think about it, which will sound trite, but I'm always looking for some kind of competitive advantage, like some type of unfair ability to compete in the marketplace. I don't get drawn to the kind of enterprise deals that are just, "Who has the better Salesforce, knock them down," kind of thing. People make money doing that. It's a valid approach. I remember the OpenTable scenario. We're meeting with Chuck [Templeton], and he's in, like, three restaurants, and we're like, "How could this ever work?" And you're like, "Well, it can work if we tip it into a network effect and then everyone has to buy it." And that's what played out. It's that kind of thing. So is that what convinced you? Like, what advantage do you mean? In that case, we were betting on the existence of a network effect. And people talk about network effects all the time, but you come up with ways to try and analyze whether it's possible or not. Will more diners lead to more restaurants, and will more restaurants lead to more diners? Are there ways to measure and study that? Or to implement the go-to-market strategy such that it exploits it as much as possible? So does your analytical approach hurt you sometimes? You're not the gut investor that some people are. It can. I think venture's really hard. And there's a lot of luck involved. And mistakes that you make — especially missing ideas — are ... it's called asymmetric returns. But if you invest in something that doesn't work, you lose one times your money. If you miss Google, you lose 10,000 times your money. You have to orient yourself toward — Bruce [Dunlevie] uses the phrase, "What could go right?" And you have to kind of think that way all the time. Oh, that's interesting. And you're more likely, being overly analytical, to talk yourself out of things. Right, right, that's what I mean. And so you have to twist your brain in the right way. Yeah, because you can think of all the wrong things, "What could go wrong?" Yeah. And by the way, the Google example is one that kind of fit that at the time. That was 1998, yeah. Excite was going bankrupt. Yup, they were. And Yahoo's stock had fallen from like 82 to 10. So search didn't look that interesting. And you had two academics and ... There's a venture rule book: "Don't back academics who insist on being CEO." [laughs] So there was a number of things that said, "Don't do it." But two of the smartest investors ever — … Sequoia and Mike Barnes ... — stepped up and did it. They also wanted a price that was seemingly ridiculous, obviously a very good investment. Did you pass on that one? We failed to pursue it. It's always important to state it that way. Because to say "pass" made it sound like we had a chance. I don't know if we had a chance. They presented to us and we failed to pursue it. And if we had, we would have had to compete with two of the best. Right. Absolutely, I remember visiting that garage, Susan Wojcicki's garage at the time. There were 25 employees when I met with them. And they were crazy, let's be clear. They were. And there were a lot of search things that had gone wrong. And Yahoo still was very strong. And, in fact, their big break was when they put Google on the Yahoo platform as the search engine. I remember. And it was a fatal error for Yahoo at the time, even though they got a big stake in it. Yup. So all right, when we get back we're going to talk about how you've developed as a venture capitalist and also some of your writings. Because you always create sort of a big old mess. Like, people start talking about the things you write, especially around bubbles. Recently you've been writing about bubbles, and you've written about them several times. You're sort of the voice of warning in the industry. When we get back with Bill Gurley of Benchmark. [ad] We're here with Bill Gurley of Benchmark, who I've known a long time. We're talking about investing, philosophy and writing about it. Now, you've been very public about your opinions. A lot of venture capitalists are super secretive. You haven't been. You were an analyst before, so you're used to writing and putting your opinions out there, and at various times you've caused sort of a kerfuffle talking about the bubble, right? At the top, where everyone's feeling good, you're like, "Just a second." Sort of like the aunt at a garden party sometimes, talking about how you had written about the trouble a-comin’. This was about six months ago? Yup. I would tell you — as a backdrop, and then I'll dive into it — that I have a philosophy that the very best entrepreneurs are disserved by bubbles. In other words, they would raise money at any time. When bubbles come along, almost anyone can raise money. And so it creates excessive competition, you get companies that are misbehaving and doing things that can disrupt markets. And so I've found, and maybe I'm just a contrarian, but I've found that like 1999 and 2015 were two of my least favorite times in Silicon Valley. Some of it I would tie back to just the behavior you see. You once said — I read something you wrote — you said, "Too much arrogance, too much bullshit will be the downfall of Silicon Valley." And it's interesting because that reminds me of a conversation I was having with Rachel Whetstone, who now runs comms at Uber. Shortly after we met, she said, "Do you watch HBO's ‘Silicon Valley?’" And I said, "No, I don't, I tried to watch the first episode and I didn't like it." And she said, "You have to watch it." And I said, "Why do I have to watch it?" She said, "The rest of the world is laughing at us." And I still to this day think half of the people in Silicon Valley don’t know that it's a parody. Ah, it's true. They like it. They like being paid attention to at all, I think. I'll give you another example of the kind of stuff that just makes me cringe. I was at an investor conference last year in Vegas, a private investor conference. That one, I know which one. Where everything leaks out. That private one. So unicorns are presenting, right? One after another. And I probably sit in on eight unicorn presentations, and five of them use the world "trillion." Now I don't think I had heard the word trillion in an investor presentation before that day. That's a big dream. But we had done something in the ecosystem to encourage this type of outlandish promotion — Going to the moon. — where you feel like you need to use words like trillion. And I think it's dangerous when we act like we have the right to disrupt everything or eat every industry, but we're not willing to play by the rules of profitability or GAAP accounting or being public. We look like entitled brats. And I think the end state, the really bad end state of that type of behavior, is we invite regulation from Washington that I prefer we not have. But I think that's possible if we play it too loose. If we play it too loose, if we talk about all these numbers ... Every three or four years, the [Wall Street] Journal has a story about the parties. I think they just recycle the same story, I don't know if it's so much the party ... What I was talking about in that quote was, I was interviewing an author who was writing about how innovation dies and how it's created. And someone asked me, and I said, "Well, it's going to be that. It's the same thing every time." And people discount risk slowly. Like they forget about pain and they forget about layoffs and they forget about that this is supposed to be hard, you need to profitable. And the younger generation, they're taught in very short time windows. So most of the entrepreneurs today weren't around in '99. So they've forgotten. They have no muscle memory of it whatsoever. There is also a mentality, though. If you have a depression-era mentality, you don't do anything, too. That's true, that's true. Absolutes on either end aren't going to get you anywhere. And, in fact, I would suggest that there are two types of entrepreneurs. There's the incredible operator who might be a COO, they hate these times. Because they can't promote. And then there's this hyper-promotional person that only comes to Silicon Valley when the time is right, and then they go away. And boy, those drive me crazy. You start to see the scammers. And you see it in the deal flow, so it goes from being 10 percent hyper promotional to 90. And I've even heard stories that I find hard to believe, but I've heard stories of reputable people in Silicon Valley, "You should overstate your numbers in your fundraising because everyone's doing it and everyone's just going to discount them anyway." If people are really doing that, it's distasteful, you know? Let's talk about what you wrote about the bubble. What were your main worries, and how do you look at them now? There was just an article in the Journal talking about how people are fixing themselves. Do you think that's the case? Somewhat, yeah. I mean look, the piece that Sequoia did, the deck that Sequoia did in ‘09 was extremely helpful to the Benchmark portfolio. Because you went into that next board meeting and everyone had kind of reevaluated where they were. And Katie Benner — who wrote that story that you're talking about — called me and said she started researching this topic and she started calling entrepreneurs, and some of the stuff I had written had inspired them to change their behavior. So that actually means a lot to me if that was a result. If we play these bubbles out, if we just get extremely promotion-to-the-end-state, then you have the type of crash you had in '01, which is complete wipeout. Like, 50 percent of people get laid off. And it'd certainly be better if we can avoid that kind of thing. Are you, as venture capitalists, sort of responsible and indulgent of these entrepreneurs? Because you have Mark — and you were talking about it, but Mark's knocked up the prices. You all knock up the prices quite high. I think everybody, to a certain extent, has to play the game on the field. I like to use the example of Hortonworks and Cloudera. So we're in this company Hortonworks, it's a Hadoop company. Cloudera raises $950 million from Intel. What do you do? You could sit around and say, "We're going to get to profitability," but you're not going to matter. You might as well lock the door and leave the building. So you're forced into a game of capital warfare that you may have not been ready to play. And so I don't know that any one person is responsible. Silicon Valley and venture capital have always been cyclical. And so there's something about human nature that causes us to be increasingly risk-seeking until someone comes along and really punishes everybody. There was that study in Iceland where the banks started taking risks — it's often men, I'm sorry to say, but women don't take the same risks. [Men] underestimate risk rather severely. Right, and there's tons of books that have been written on different types of asset bubbles. There's another contributing factor, I think, right now, which is [that] we've had low global interest rates for the past seven years. And I was fortunate enough this summer to meet Warren Buffett — Chamath [Palihapitiya] was the one that made that happen. But we only had one question each, and I said, "You know, in our industry we're seeing that low interest rates are leading to overt competition that's irrational." And he says, "You bet it is." And he's seeing it in his business as well, and I think it's played out in natural gas and all these other pockets. Real estate in Silicon Valley, right? All these asset prices, because with interest rates so low you just have people looking for yield, so money sloshes around. I always say there's not enough rat holes to shove it all down in Silicon Valley. It's true. I would have never imagined in my life as a venture capitalist that the biggest problem would be too much capital everywhere. So what do you do? Here you are, trying to compete with your Hadoop company and others, what do you do? Do you discipline yourself or do you just go along for the crazy ride? I write about what could go wrong in the hope that it might correct something, but I may not have been very successful at that. You play the game on the field, and the game on the field may be particularly sloppy. You're trying to outraise one another, which perpetuates the problem. You out-hype each other. Yeah. You try and spend more efficiently, even though everyone's losing way more money. And one of my biggest things that I've said about this current time is the risk we're taking because of the size of the losses. If you go back to ‘99, there were a whole bunch of companies going public and everything, but people were still moving towards profitability at $30 or $40 million in revenue. And this is way different. There's way fewer companies, whatever the number of unicorns is, but they're being given piles of money. Hundreds of millions. And burn rates are areas we've never seen before. And steering those back towards profitability, if capital ever becomes scarce, is going to be a really difficult exercise. So how are you going to do that? I don't know. "Put down that free kombucha shake right now!" And look, there's been some things that I think have been super helpful. Tomas speaking out on Kind bars and brick walls, and then you know, this summer over at Dropbox, Drew Houston went out, it looks like he did a press tour about cutting $35 million of perks out of Dropbox and did it in a way that he was proud of. And you've had the Evernote thing as well, where they've corrected some of that stuff. And seeing him as a leader talk about that as a smart exercise is awesome. And a sign, like some of the stuff that Katie wrote about, that we're moving back in the right direction. Do you ever feel you can do anything else to impact entrepreneurs besides writing? What would you write right now, if you were doing that essay? I've got an unwritten blog post about unit economics. One of the things that Silicon Valley does when it gets risk-seeking, which it did in '99 and now, is they invest in businesses with lower and lower gross margins. And that's riskier. And a lot of times those involve consumer products. And then what they do is they start selling them heavily discounted. And there's this old saying about selling dollars for 85 cents. But there's a truism to it. You can create infinite revenue if you sell dollars for 85 cents. And if you give consumers more value than you charge them for, they will love you. And I remind entrepreneurs all the time that Webvan had the highest NPS scores of any company I've ever known. It wasn't that the consumer proposition didn't work, it was that the economics didn't work. They weren't charging enough for the service level. What's interesting about that is that conceptually, it was the right idea. A lot of things are directionally correct, but it wasn't working out on an economic basis. They should have been charging more money, basically. Anyway, we're in one of those time frames. Some of that's starting to get cleaned up. There's probably been more shutdowns this year than in the previous three. Or sales. Or sales. And layoffs. You're starting to smell for the first time. I've heard signs of some real estate correcting. I'm hopeful that it can be a soft landing. Historically, it hasn't been. Right. What could happen? Oh, what could happen? I mean, macro is really hard to get right. And Buffet and those guys don't even try. We've got an election, we've got so much going on. I think the European situation is probably a bigger hotbed. If Italy or something defects from the EU, and the kind of thing that could cause. China's GDP, a lot of people are worried about. I don't have enough knowledge to know whether that could be the catalyst, but it could be. We're talking to Bill Gurley about investing and the bubble and some of the things he's written about it. When we get back, we're going to talk about his current investments and some other thoughts that he has going forward. [ad] ************* We're here with Bill Gurley, the well-known venture capitalist in Silicon Valley who works at Benchmark. He's been involved in lots and lots of companies. He was an analyst before that, but he's one of the most high-profile venture capitalists, VCs, in the Valley. Today, the Journal had a piece about how you guys are doing pretty well. Little bit of smack-around of Andreessen Horowitz. How do you judge yourselves? It's difficult. The venture industry, as I mentioned earlier, you have to be very fortunate to fall on what people sometimes refer to as positive black swans, these break-out plays. And I think you could spend your whole career and do extremely well and never get behind one of the ones: A Facebook, a Google, that kind of thing. And it's almost impossible to predict ahead of time what's going to turn into something like that. And so it just creates a ton of anxiety. I would also say that it's an extremely cyclical business and so you might be doing well in '99 and really eating crow in '01 or '02. And so it goes up and down and it's hard. What we try and do internally is we keep track of what we're doing, what our competitors are doing and what are the deals or investments that we regret not doing. And we just constantly talk about it. What are the regrets? What are the investments? We'll talk about the ones you've done. Right now? It's the obvious ones. It's Airbnb, Pinterest, Slack, GitHub is one that we're fascinated with. I think the Collison brothers at Stripe are … Which you didn't do? Which we didn't do. I like them more than their business, but I really like them. Pinterest? On them, it's just like the thing I said about growth mindset. Like, learn-it-alls. They're nuts. They're just begging for information, which I love. I think with Pinterest it's just the size and scope. It got way bigger than we would have predicted. And the others? Slack, I think it's fairly obvious. It's a viral enterprise tool. And you didn't think that would be. Well, there had been Yammer. It was a pivot, it was a game company. Yeah it was, I remember. You can't kiss them all. And Airbnb, you know, Matt brought it in like his first week he had joined us. And we got caught up on one of our rules about ownership and redid it for a lower ownership. One of your rules. Do you think you should have rules? What are your biggest rules? You try to maximize ownership, take a board seat. There aren't that many [rules]. No academics in garages. You can get into trouble. And one of the games you play in venture is to know which rules to break at the right time. And so we constantly challenge ourselves. Like, "Should we maybe be dropping this rule at this moment in time because things are changing?" Does that make you the most insecure people on the planet? It might. It feels like it sometimes. Chasing the breakout. And when the close happens on one of those, it's actually a really perverse element of the venture industry. Like the moment that John Doerr and Mike Moritz closed the Google investment, which was probably all of a week and half, it was the biggest event in both those firms for over a decade. Yeah, without even knowing it at the time. And something had happened in a week and a half. And for a lot of those companies, and I'll include the ones we're in, if you worked there it probably would have come out that way anyway. So the seminal event was that closing event that was very quick. Right, and decisions were made quickly. Often on a instinct, actually. And in that case, like we talked about previously, most people's instincts would say, "Don't do it." So talk about what you did do. Obviously your biggest — there's a couple at Benchmark, but Uber is one of your big ones. I've talked to all of you about how that happened and various people, of course, take credit all the time and this and that. But it really was Matt and then you others there. And it went back and forth actually, initially. Having come out of OpenTable being successful, I was trying to think of other industries where, if you put a network on top of [it, that] would absorb waste and make it more efficient and more usable. And the thesis of cars had come up, and we had met with several taxi [startups] — there were actually taxi startups before Uber. And we had quickly come to the conclusion that doing it on top of taxi wasn't the right way to do it because prices were fixed, they’re oligopolies, there's regulation, and if anyone did it on town cars, we would pay attention. So that was a thesis we had internally when they popped up. Which was a town car kind of offering. Ride in style, whatever it was. Yeah, so we immediately cold-called them, and I remember meeting with Ryan and Travis at a restaurant and then I brought them [in]. This was before their seed round, and this is the part you're talking about about going back and forth. And they presented the company to us for the seed round and we chose not to do it at that point in time. And then for the next three or four months … What that like, Calacanis and Sacca were in that one, right? That's right. And then over the next three or four months Matt became, I think, the No. 1 rider on Uber. And as he's done many times in our partnership — … This is Matt Cohler ... — he came into the room screaming, "We have to do it! We have to do it! We have to do it!" And so we got aggressively in front of the series A. And what did you think at the time? What would happen here? Of the entrepreneur, Travis, and obviously Garrett Camp was involved and others. Between the time we looked at the seed and when we did the A, Travis had moved into the CEO position. At the beginning we were just studying him as an angel investor in the thing, and probably by the time the A came around he was the CEO. It was hard. Like I said, we had a theory that it could be like OpenTable. So you know, OpenTable was sold for like $3 billion or something. So I'd be inaccurate if I suggested we had a vision that it could one day cause people to question car ownership. I never had considered that. And what do you think of the person? He's quite aggressive. He is, he is. So Matt had known him for a while. I actually called Mark Cuban, because Cuban had been an investor in Red Swoosh, and they had ended up in a disagreement, yet Mark had walked away thinking Travis was remarkably professional even though they had different points of opinion, which I took as a positive. I like to think I knew how passionate he was. But I didn't. We were taking a chance. I'm remarkably thrilled, now that we're involved, to see a guy who's just so committed to what he does. Right, but some say too committed, too aggressive. Do you provide, "Slow this the hell down, stop arguing with people." You know, it's funny, in the book I mentioned earlier, "Grit," this woman Angela Duckworth had studied all these people that have been successful. And she claims, and there's a big TED video that's only six minutes which is quicker to watch than reading the book, but she says the key characteristic that differentiates successful people from unsuccessful isn't IQ, it's grit. And she describes grit as passionate perseverance. And on those two dimensions, I think Travis may be completely on the far rail. One of the board members described him as "remarkably all-in." You know? Yeah. But that can become abrasive and irritating, which to many it has. Completely understand. I do think that most VCs would probably yearn for most of their founders and CEOs to have some of this grit. Does that have to change, and do you have an impact on that? I think every one of the entrepreneurs that gets thrown into the limelight in the way that he has — And with failures before. He really did have a lot of trouble. By the way, I think those contribute to the grit. Oh absolutely, I think it's right at the heart of it. He spent so much time on these startups and one of them went bankrupt and one he sold for $20 million. And in the first one he sort of got screwed by his investors. Absolutely. And just years and years of trying. I often think that the grit is driven by some kind of obligation to the Entrepreneur Society of America. Because he knows how hard it is to be on one of the ones that's not working. Yeah, I felt it was rage. It was just like, "This one's going to work." And so you get on one that has the wind at your back instead of your face and you're like, "I'm going to play it for all it's worth." And I do feel like that's part of the motivation. So, just finishing up on Uber, obviously you're on the board, correct? Correct. When is it going public? You know, I don't think that we're going to be going public anytime in the near future because of all the issues that we just talked about. We have a large number of competitors, even with the deal done. Well done, by the way. Thank you. [Competitors] who are very deep pocketed, who have decided that their primary form of competition is not going to be like building a different app or a differentiated service or a different level, it's just price. And so there are intense subsidy battles going on. All over the world. All over the world. And those companies, when they approach investors, tell them, "Uber is going to go public, and then they're going to have to be profitable, and then we're really going to sneak up on them with these discounts." While that's the game on the field, and it's one that I find to be remarkably messy and ugly, I don't think it would be in our best interest. So raising more money is the way to go. I don't know if we need to. We have $9 billion in the bank and $2 billion of debt, which is the most any private company has ever raised. Does that frighten you? Yeah, but two things. One, I do think that it is one of the best product market fits that has ever come along. And as I've come to realize what's possible here, there is a real opportunity to literally change the face of America. You talked about that early on, I remember. Like car ownership has gotten way too far in our country. 2.3 per household. I agree. And parking lots. Houston has like 4.5 parking spots per car. And there's an opportunity to change it. You can actually lower housing pricing if you remove parking requirements. So we're doing deals now with developers and getting cities to approve them to have parking-free housing. It's definitely hit into a bigger trend. A bigger, more important trend. And if you survey people, Recode had an article about a survey, and even though the Recode article was a little dismissive, it said 8 percent of the people in the survey said that ride-sharing had a strong likelihood to impact car buying decisions. That's 8 percent. This stuff only existed five years ago. Yup, it's like smartphones, early on. Yeah, what will that number be five years from now? Absolutely, I don't drive my car anymore. I think it's a leading edge. I know a ton of people who have gotten rid of their cars. Does that ruin the idea of public [transportation]? I was at a meeting the other day talking about how private transportation companies do not take the place of public transportation. I think most of the ride-sharing companies, if you look at heat maps, and they've published some of these, have huge red areas around public transportation. So most of the effective public transportation, which isn't buses, it's the subways and rails, they can't get to that last mile. And there have been studies done that suggest they're symbiotic. That they actually drive more usage of each. So let's talk about — we're going to finish up in just a minute — what else are you in now that you think is very exciting? What makes you excited? A couple. I'd probably mention three. So, Nextdoor, which is a social network for the local neighborhood that's really starting to grow. Which also has issues around racism ... They've done a really good job of addressing those in the past couple of weeks. They're trying. It's like Twitter, it's humanity, right? Absolutely. Although mine is just horrible. Is there any black person who can walk down the street that's not suspect? I'm like, "Can you stop?" Yeah, they've just come out with a whole bunch of new programs on this front. I think some of the initial people that were upset have come around and sanctioned what they're doing. So I feel good about how they've done that. Tools are important. Why do you like that one? If you go back to like 2006, the local advertising market was like 110 billion. And many of the avenues people would use to microcast advertising were radio, newspapers, magazines. They've come under threat from digital disruption, and there's not a place for people to bring that out. I also think by having a social network in the neighborhood, there's lots of features that you can implement over time. We're starting to do some of those now. And also because we're not dependent on anyone. We're not an SEO company, we didn't build on the back of Facebook Connect, we built this out ourselves. Right. It's a bulletin board. It didn't work with AOL, with Patch, which was interesting. Well, Patch is more heavily content-oriented. They did a bunch of anti-intuitive things to make the liquidity come alive. Intuitive funds were from Epinions that had built the UGC network before. I'll mention two others. Stitch Fix is just an incredible company. She's amazing. Katrina Lake's one of the best I've ever worked with. It's right here in the city, most people don't know about it. Explain it. They've built personalized women's fashion. Although they're moving into beta on men's now. And I like to think about it — no woman that's buying fashion wants to think about it this way — but I like to think about it as Moneyball for women's retail. And for every woman that comes in, they fill out a 15-page questionnaire to suss out size, fit, style, whether it's for work or social, and then for every item, we measure 66 characteristics. And then there's a data science team that's over 70 people now. In fact, Stitch Fix is the No. 1 competitor of Uber for data science talent in Silicon Valley. Eric Colson, who runs that group came from Netflix and did all the recommendation stuff there. And so when a customer comes in to ask for a new Fix, which is an interesting drug metaphor, and this package comes to them, we have a predicted keep score for every item in our inventory. Which is a level of analytics brought to this industry that's maybe one or two orders of magnitude above what everybody else is [doing]. Did you know I covered retail for seven years? And one of the companies was hot, and then it wasn't, and I went to the CEO after — it was a teen company, these things go up and down — I said, "What happened?" He goes, "Pedal pushers. I picked pedal pushers and not culottes. And that was the end of me." [laughs] I'm like, "Why?" He's like, "I just guessed." It was really funny, I'll never forget that, "pedal pushers." And that's what retail's been. We're now working with merchandisers who have ideas. And they test the ideas against the algorithm instead of ever shipping them. And so it's really cool. There's an article written on her recently called "Moneyball Fashionista" that has the whole [thing]. Huh, interesting. There's all kind of interesting experiments going on in retail. Yeah, it's really cool. All right, you get one more. What else? I'd probably talk about HackerOne. Oh, I don't know that one. So Sheryl once said that the smartest thing Facebook ever did on the security front was start a bug bounty program. And bug bounty means you basically pay the hackers to find the holes before the bad guys do. Yeah there's all kinds of crowd-sourcing on this. Yeah. Microsoft, Facebook, Mozilla, there've been people who have done this before, but they all did it kind of holistically within their own firm. Alex Rice, who worked on these programs at Facebook, created a startup that will allow anyone to have a bug bounty program. So in like 18 months, we've got over 500 customers including Priceline, Salesforce, Uber, GM, Home Depot, the Pentagon. And they're all now running bug bounty programs. And then we have a marketplace of all the hackers and all the reputations and skill sets. And it's really cool. And I think you look at the problem, huge problem, most of the solutions are defensive where you're just throwing hardware and software. And this one's offensive, right? Because you're fighting the battle in front of them. I see, interesting. It's elegant. And Mårten Mickos, who ran MySQL, is the CEO over there now. Oh, that's a really interesting company. And he's awesome. So what is overhyped? What would I say is overhyped ... You can name names. Well, some of the categories that become difficult, I would say, in this type of world, are ones where capital can create this messy playing field that I'm talking about. And one of those where I think that's happened is in the online lending space. Aha, there's a lot of those. SoFi, others. SoFi and Avant have raised a billion dollars and Lending Co. went public, and there's OnDeck and Square, and it's like, if everyone just starts aggressively giving away money, it's hard to build a business, you know? And so those are the things that get dangerous. I would say that some of the ones where we over-choreograph are difficult. Like VR, because the big guys all pull out their R&D teams and their guns, so Samsung and HTC and Facebook, they're all at the table. Most big startup breakouts are where people aren't paying attention. As opposed to where everybody's got their guns lined up. Do you like VR? I think that the screen resolution is not there yet. And a lot of the demos to get people excited are on $30, $40,000 equipment. Right, exactly. And it's hard to use. And you put on the stuff that you can buy today and it's pixelated. I had a big argument with someone about this. And so I do think there's a risk that we run into what's known as a trough of disillusionment before you get a breakout because of that. What about current companies, I'll finish up with this. Twitter. I ask everyone. You know, I'm one of the biggest optimists about what's possible out of Twitter. Most people feel that way. Primarily because the most important people in the world are curating their persona there. And you can get them to do more work than they're already doing today. Yeah, it was interesting, because Mike McCue is a former board member who is running for the board. He said it's a bigger phenomenon than it is a company. Look, it may be. I think running businesses at scale is probably the most underrated activity in Silicon Valley relative to how hard it is, you know. How hard it is? I know you guys are all like, "It's so hard." I'm like, "I thought you're the smartest people on earth." Fair enough. I don't really care because you're all rich and smart. Fair enough, but what [John] Donahoe did at eBay is really really hard. And most entrepreneurs like to take potshots at big companies in a way that I think is disrespectful. What do you imagine will happen to it, then? There's always a chance that there's a sale process. I guess Ev [Williams] was rumored in the press yesterday talking about that. I think there's a lot of opportunity to kind of micro-segment around interest groups, because today the way the feed's oriented. If I love all country music, which I do — Me too. — if Ryan Adams happens to say something at the right time, I find it. I thought you could mine the feed and build a Techmeme for everything. And so there could be an alt-country newspaper that it’s pulling from, and you have a ranking table. I've talked to Jack [Dorsey] and the team about it. I hope one day they do it. I think it could lead to something. What happens to these companies? I think the problem is a smallish company gets a lot of attention because of journalists, and then it's sort of a narrative, the way Yahoo became. Yup. It's possible. And it gets sucked up into that. Yeah. It's possible, you know. There's a lot of heat, pressure. What is a mistake that you've made and learned from, as a venture capitalist or investor, anything. You talked about being too analytical and missing some of the instinctual stuff. Is there anything you did that you're like, "Oh I shoulda done it this way?" Or what do you tell entrepreneurs? The immediate thing that comes to my mind was the Google investment, because you can't make a bigger mistake. I was trying to think of another one since we already talked about that. That's a big one. But what went on there as an investor? As I mentioned, some of the external data points lead you to have some amount of skepticism. The product usage was already starting to happen. We were all using it in our office. It was a better product, so we can't blame that. And we were already talking about, "Oh you just do what GoTo did." So the business motto really wasn't a question either. Everyone was already saying that. I think it came down to the price at the time was remarkably high, and the team was remarkably self-confident in a way that would cause you to question whether they could pull it off. But they did. And I go back, I think the learning is that if you have remarkably asymmetric returns, you have to ask yourself, "How high could up be?" And then that "what could go right?" question. Because it's not a 50/50 thing on the judgment call. Like, if you thought it was a 20 percent chance at doing it, you should still do it, because the upside is so high. Right. What do you want to invest in? What interests you a great deal now? Like AI, everyone's either terrified with it or thrilled with it. I've been spending a lot of time looking at the health care space. Ah, you're going to wade in there. Well, I look at the technologies, I look at the smartphone, I look at what we've done with UGC plays, I look at what we've done even with Zillow and real estate. And I say, "Boy, this thing's really messed up, we ought to be able to fix it." Now, my first two years of looking at stuff has caused me to step back a little bit because it is atrociously complex. And the way that regulation works, the way that the payers, the company who doesn't even really want to be in the process ... They've made quite a thicket, haven't they? Oh, it's so messed up. There are some little signs of seedlings that it could become more of a payer situation. And we're an investor in One Medical, which I think is exploiting this. Like, "The customer wants to be treated like a customer, and they haven't been in this space." And if you implement something where they feel that way ... Well, you endure a lot. Oh god, it's ridiculous. It's so ridiculous. So health care. Anywhere else? AI? Yeah, we look at that kind of stuff. I tend to like the stuff that's applied in machine learning and AI, like a Stitch Fix, rather than building something to sell to somebody. The things that Amazon is doing in both e-tailing and AWS causes you to rewrite your entire rule set. And it is changing so fast that almost everything we've done in the past, we've got to reconsider. All right, last question. Are we in a bubble, Mr. Gurley? Mr. Anti-bubble? Are we in a bub-bull? I think certainly we have taken on more risk than we realize and there will be consequences of that. Because there's so much money in these things, nothing goes away overnight. And a few very well-known companies have already been recap, which means that the investors that were on the cap chartered zero. And you don't see that. The thing is still bumbling along. I'd like to see that, you can send me those. But I think there'll be more of that over time. More of that. And sales, too. Yup. And see the sales of things as they go, like LinkedIn and others. I think those are the signs of something profound. Yeah, I think those happen because, well, two things. I think when the markets stop going only up and to the right — prior to that, a lot of the unicorn entrepreneurs were thinking infinity is the top, and so all of a sudden you shake that a little bit and they get a little more reality. And the you might be able to bridge a bit with an acquire. So Bill Gurley's still worried? I am. But maybe that's my universal state. Yeah, I think it is. All right, Bill, thank you so much for coming. No problem, thanks for having me. recode_divider More From Recode Here’s the secret to Starry Internet’s plan to beam the internet to your house and break up the broadband monopoly Full transcript: Recode’s April Glaser talks drones on Too Embarrassed to Ask Recode Daily: Fake Facebook news is a danger to democracy, says Obama Do 'productivity hacks' really help you get stuff done?

S&P Futures 2,184.25 0.00 (0.00%) Dow Futures 18,868.00 -1.00 (-0.01%) The Latest: Analysts are lukewarm about Google's new gadgets Associated PressOctober 4, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The Latest on Google's product event (all times local): 12:45 p.m. Analysts say Google's new lineup of phones, other devices and artificial intelligence services may have trouble attracting consumers in large numbers, at least for now. For instance, so-called intelligent assistants often don't live up to their early promises, says analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy. What's more, he warned that Google's service may use some of the information shared by users to create profiles for advertising. Google didn't address that in its presentation Tuesday. And while Google was smart to emphasize the performance of the new smartphone cameras, Moorhead added in an email, he said other features in the new phones don't seem very different from what Samsung and Apple have offered. Gartner's Brian Blau, meanwhile, said the new Google Assistant could help the company tie its various hardware and software offerings together. But he's also skeptical that Google's Pixel phones will dent Apple-Samsung dominance in the smartphone market, especially since Pixels will be more expensive than phones in Google's previous Nexus line. "To be honest, that was one of the attractive points" of the Nexus, he says. ___ 11 a.m. Google is making a greater commitment to hardware in unveiling new phones, a smart speaker and other gadgets. The products announced Tuesday also underscore Google's hope that by designing both hardware and the software — the way Apple has long done — products and features will work better, with little input needed from users. For instance, the new smart speaker called Home will be able to use voice to control Netflix and other video on Google's Chromecast streaming device. Google also hinted that the approach lets Google take full advantage of capabilities it's designing with artificial intelligence and machine learning. It hasn't offered examples, though, on what users will be able to do on its new Pixel phones that they won't be able to do on Android phones from Samsung and others. Another theme running throughout the event: Products will get smarter thanks to artificial intelligence technology developed by Google. The features demonstrated seem similar to what Amazon and Apple already offer with their virtual assistants. Google officials have repeatedly emphasized that its AI technology is in the early stages — so it remains to be seen what this new era for Google will lead to. ___ 10:25 a.m. Google is promoting its new Home smart speaker as a way to access Google's knowledge — hands free. It will suggest the best way to get places, thanks to Google Maps, or find answers from other sources, such as Wikipedia. A feature called My Day will also offer a summary of your upcoming day. You'll need to give Google permission to activate that. Amazon, Apple and Microsoft all have variations of such assistants. Home will work closely with other Google devices. For example, if you have a Chromecast streaming device, you can use Home to control video on your TV. The feature will be limited at first. In some cases, Google will have to fine tune the software to work with specific services. Netflix will be one of the first to work, so you can simply ask Google Home to start the Netflix show "Orange is the New Black." Home will be available for almost $130 and come with six months of YouTube Red, a $10-a-month ad-free subscription. Orders start Tuesday; Home will be in stores on Nov. 4. The cylinder-shaped Echo costs $180, though Amazon also sells a smaller version shaped like a hockey puck that sells for $50. ___ 10:15 a.m. Google is ready to start selling its echo of Amazon's Echo. The Echo is an internet-connected speaker featuring a voice-activated digital assistant. It's moving into more homes and lessening the need to find information on Google's search engine. As a counterpunch to Amazon, Google has built a similar two-way speaker that it simply calls "Home." It will be able to perform many of the same tasks as Echo, including playing music and fielding questions about everything from the weather to what's playing at the local theater. Google Home will also be able to control lights, appliances and other devices around the house, assuming you've installed "smart" versions of them. Read More Google teased the Home device at a technology conference in May and is offering more details Tuesday. Google is betting that the knowledge that it has gained while running the world's dominant search engine will make the computer-powered assistant in Home smarter than Amazon's Alexa in the Echo, which has been on the market since 2014. If you're feeling creepy about a speaker listening to your conversations, Google says you can turn the microphone off. ___ 10:12 a.m. Google is updating its Chromecast video-streaming device for watching Netflix and other online video on big screens. The new device, Chromecast Ultra, will support a higher-resolution format called 4K. That's a feature already offered by larger, more expensive streaming devices such as the $100 Amazon Fire TV. Ultra will cost about $70. Chromecast's low price has won over a lot of households. But you need a companion phone to play, pause and fast forward video, disrupting email, Facebook and other tasks you might want to do while watching TV. Google is facing competition with low-end devices. Roku just announced a $30 Express model that's about the size of a finger, while Amazon just updated its $40 Fire TV Stick. Both of those devices come with a remote, making them suitable stand-alone gadgets. But neither streams in 4K. ___ 10:10 a.m. Google wants to improve Wi-Fi in the home by creating its own router. The company says people use internet differently now, with games, video chatting and more on various devices throughout the home. The new Google Wi-Fi system will be modular — just add new components based on how your home and rooms are shaped. Software will help manage the various access points for you as you move around. It will cost almost $130 for the main device. A three-pack for larger homes will cost about $300. ___ 10:00 a.m. Google has unveiled its own virtual-reality headset, called Daydream View. It will differ from other headsets like Samsung's Gear VR in having a companion motion controller and compatibility with a wide range of phones, including Google's new Pixel phones. Daydream is a challenge to more sophisticated systems from Facebook's Oculus business, HTC and Sony — as well as to Google's own Cardboard effort. Cardboard is cheap — available for as little as $15 — but it doesn't offer much control over VR environments beyond pushing a button on the headset as you move your head. The new wireless motion controller for Daydream can function like a fishing rod, a steering wheel or a pointer to permit more sophisticated VR experiences. Although Google will make its own Daydream headset, it plans to share design guidelines with other manufacturers. Google says 50 partners are bringing apps and games to Daydream, with more on the way. Google services such as photos, YouTube and Street View maps will also come to Daydream. The unveiling came at a Google event in San Francisco on Tuesday. Daydream View and the controller will be out in November for $79. ___ 9:50 a.m. Google is stepping up the marketing of its new Pixel phones, and will offer them through Verizon as well as Google's own online Play store. Previously, Google phones have largely been limited to online orders. The new phones will come in two screen sizes — 5 inches and 5.5 inches. The smaller one will cost about $650, with orders starting Tuesday; the larger version will go for about $750. Google says the camera on Pixel phones will be "excellent." Pixel owners will also get unlimited storage of photos at full resolution. Others get unlimited storage at high resolution of up to 16 megapixels; and anything sharper than that gets reduced in quality to qualify. However, Google's Pixels cameras are 12 megapixels, so they would have qualified under the regular plan anyway. The phones will be the first ones compatible with Google's upcoming Daydream virtual-reality system. ___ 9:40 a.m. Google is introducing a new line of smartphones in its most aggressive challenge yet to Apple and Samsung. The phones unveiled Tuesday in San Francisco will carry the Pixel brand, which Google has previously stamped on a tablet and a Chromebook laptop. The phones will have Google's virtual assistant and artificial intelligence service, Google Assistant, built in. The company says computing is becoming more dependent on AI, not just on being mobile. Google has released a series of its own phones, dubbed Nexus, since 2010. Those phones had limited distribution and were typically embraced by Google purists. Now, the company is casting aside the Nexus name as it aims to become an even more prominent player in the mobile market Google, of course, already provides the Android system software that powers more than 80 percent of the world's smartphones. The new push pits Google against a familiar foe in Apple and its iPhone. But it also poses a new threat to Samsung, the biggest maker of Android phones. ___ 9:30 a.m. Google is taking a page from Apple's playbook by making a bigger push to build its own hardware. Rick Osterloh, head of Google's newly formed hardware group, says that by building hardware itself, Google can take full advantage of capabilities it's designing with artificial intelligence and machine learning. Apple has long taken a similar approach by designing both iPhone hardware and the iOS operating-system software that runs on it. Google has designed hardware before, but Osterloh says Google will now get deeper into it. ___ 9:15 a.m. Google is opening an event in San Francisco with a prediction that artificial intelligence will play a greater role in our lives. CEO Sundar Pichai says computing is transitioning to an artificial-intelligence-first world, just as it moved to a mobile-first world just a few years ago. Pichai says, "Our goal is to build a personal Google for each and every user. We want to build a Google for each user." Google services along those lines include Google Assistant, software that's designed to answer questions and retrieve information, conversation-style. Google Assistant made its debut in a chat app called Allo a few weeks ago. It will also be part of the upcoming Home smart speaker. Google is expected to announce more details at the event. The event — held at the former power plant for a chocolate factory — started with video showing characters from the HBO show "Silicon Valley" bantering about expectations. ___ 7:35 a.m. Google will ramp up its consumer electronics strategy Tuesday as it's expected to announce new gadgets at an event in San Francisco. The products include new smartphones and an internet-connected personal-assistant for the home similar to Amazon's Echo speaker. All are intended to showcase Google's software and online services. Analysts and industry blogs say a virtual-reality headset and a home router could also be on tap. Google makes most of its money from online software and digital ads. But it's putting more emphasis on hardware as it faces rivals like Apple, Amazon and Samsung. Julie Ask at Forrester Research says new devices could help Google keep its services front and center in the battle for consumers' attention.

Google Chromecast Ultra 4K vs Chromecast 2: What's the difference? by Sean Keach 04 October 2016 0 shares Read Comments Considering upgrading to Google’s first 4K Chromecast? Here are the differences between the Google Chromecast 2 and the Google Chromecast Ultra. What is Google Chromecast? A brief history Google Chromecast is a range of digital media players. They’re small dongles that plug into the back of your TV to give it additional "smart" functionalities, such as enabling you to stream images, video and music over Wi-Fi. Most people will use their Android smartphones to control the Chromecast, but you can also use Google Chrome. There's a range of supported apps for accessing content (in the UK, these include: Netflix, Red Bull TV, BBC iPlayer, All4, Now TV, and BT Sport), as well as the option to mirror media from your phone or laptop. The first-generation Chromecast launched in 2013, followed by the Chromecast 2 in 2015. The second-generation version featured a more powerful chip and a redesigned body. On October 4 2016, Google announced the Chromecast Ultra, which is the latest version of Chromecast, and the first to support 4K video. But which one should you buy? Watch: Google's Pixel phone event in just 3 minutes Related: Google October event Chromecast Ultra vs Chromecast 2 – Design While the Chromecast 2 looked very different to the original Chromecast, there’s not been much change with the Chromecast Ultra. The new model has retained its predecessor's small, circular form factor, and still comes in black. The integrated HDMI cable still magnetically attaches to the back of the Chromecast when not in use. The most striking difference is that the Chrome logo has been completely binned, and replaced by Google’s "G" branding. It’s also worth noting that the Chromecast Ultra runs on firmware version 1.21, which was only recently released as a beta to Chromecast Preview members. What’s interesting is that, as of 1.21, the Chromecast logo has also been wiped from the software completely, again replaced by the Google "G". Chromecast Ultra vs Chromecast 2 – Specs, Features and Performance Here’s a quick run-down of the Google Chromecast 2 specs: Chip: Marvell Armada 1500 Mini Plus RAM: 512MB Storage: 256MB Connectivity: HDMI, Wi-Fi, Ethernet Power: Micro USB Dimensions: 51.9 x 51.9 x 13.49mm Weight: 39.1g The Chromecast 2 displays content in Full HD 1080p resolution – that’s 1,920 x 1,080 pixels. Regardless of whether you have a Full HD or 4K TV, you’ll still only be able to watch 1080p footage. And if you have a 720p HD TV, the content will be downscaled to 1,280 x 720 pixels. Related: Google Pixel phone Unfortunately, we still don’t have much information on the Google Chromecast Ultra’s hardware. However, we can take a guess at some of the components. For a start, the first two Chromecasts featured Marvell's Armada chips, created based on ARM designs. Logic dictates that the Chromecast Ultra has followed suit. Marvell offers just two chips that are more powerful than the Chromecast 2’s processor, and both of them support 4K content. Those chips are the Armada 1500 Pro4K and the Armada 1500 Ultra. We’re willing to bet the Chromecast Ultra features one of them, especially since Google is touting a 1.8x performance improvement. For the record, 4K – or Ultra HD – means content with 3,840 x 2,160 pixels. That’s four times sharper than Full HD. If you have a Chromecast Ultra and a 4K TV, you’ll be able to watch any content filmed in 4K resolution using the Chromecast. If your TV isn’t 4K, you’ll just end up watching the video in Full HD or lower. And if the content you’re watching isn’t 4K, then you won’t see 4K footage either – obviously. We also know that the Chromecast Ultra still supports HDMI and Wi-Fi connections, and has very similar dimensions and weight to the Chromecast 2. The new version supports High Dynamic Range and Dolby Vision, too. Chromecast Ultra vs Chromecast 2 – Price In the UK, the Chromecast 2 is going for £30 at most retailers, while the Chromecast Ultra will cost a far heftier £69. So you're clearly paying a big premium for the 4K, HDR, and Dolby Vision support. Related: Best 4K TVs 2016 Chromecast Ultra vs Chromecast 2 – Which Chromecast should I buy? The answer here is pretty easy. If you’ve got a 4K TV, you might as well pick up a Chromecast Ultra when it launches in November – it seems silly not to. And if you’re using a Full HD (or lower resolution) TV, you’re better off sticking with the cheaper Chromecast 2. However, it’s also worth questioning whether you really want a Chromecast. There are plenty of good alternatives, including the Roku Streaming Stick (£29) and the Amazon Fire Stick (£34.99). The Roku has a better library of content, but the mirroring isn’t as slick. And the Fire Stick is a little more expensive than Chromecast, but you’ll be able to watch Amazon Video content, which is missing from the Chromecast.

The controller can just snug into Daydream headset (anti-loss). Clay drops the nifty device as he was just saying that Google works on details. 10:16 PM: Google, just like Apple, has not changed the price of its phone. 10:15 PM: The phone will be available via Flipkart, Croma, and Reliance Digital in India (based on a slide Google showed). It’s a Verizon exclusive in the US. And will be available unlocked via Google Store for $649. Available for pre-orders today in US, Australia, Canada.

By Natalie Gagliordi for Between the Lines | October 4, 2016 -- 17:18 GMT (10:18 PDT) | Topic: Internet of Things (Image: Google) At its "Made by Google" event Tuesday, Google offered more information about its Amazon Echo-like Google Home device. First announced at Google I/O in May, Google Home is a voice-activated, smart home virtual assistant hub. The device is capable of connecting to other gadgets around the home (such as the Nest thermostat) and completing basic tasks like playing music or searching Google. What's Hot on ZDNet When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office? GE Digital builds up its global presence with acquisitions, partnerships ​Domino's claims world-first pizza drone delivery Microsoft delivers test builds of Visual Studio for Mac, Visual Studio 2017 for Windows Today we're learning that at launch Google Home will sell for $129 at Best Buy, Walmart, and Target. The device will come in a bevy of color options for the swappable base and includes a free six-month trial of YouTube Red. Pre-orders for Google Home start today and the device will ship on Nov. 4. In the context of the smart home, Google Home's initial partners will be Nest, SmartThings, Philips Hue, and IFTTT. Google says the design of Google Home was inspired by things like wine glasses and candles (although some may also suggest air fresheners) and that it's really meant to work in a hands-free way. But when voice activation fails, there's a capacitive touch pad on top of the device for additional controls, as well as a mic mute button on the back so users can choose whether they want Google listening in for the so-called "hot word". At the core of Google Home is the Google Assistant, which promises to give users an ongoing, two-way dialogue with Google. Google Assistant uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to get to know users over time, based on their behavior patterns and preferences -- essentially creating a personalized Google for each user. Google Home and the newly unveiled Pixel phone are the first devices to have the Google Assistant built natively into the hardware. "We are building hardware with the Google Assistant at its core so you can get things done without worrying about the underlying technology," said Google's hardware chief Rick Osterloh. In terms of the smart-speaker showdown inevitably brewing between Google Home and Amazon Echo, it's still a bit too early to predict a winner. But most analysts agree that a smart-home play could work to Google's advantage if done correctly and ultimately boost its relevance amid hardware developers. "The launch of Google Home with Google Assistant uplevels Google's play as a virtual assistant and is a natural extension of Google's path towards becoming the agent that sits between brands and their customers," said Forrester mobile analyst Julie Ask. "The 'holy grail' of becoming a consumer's virtual assistant will be hard for Google to obtain, but holds unprecedented business value if Google achieves this goal."

Conversely, Android devices were always a bit of a hodge-podge; hardware makers designed the hardware and did their best to integrate the Android operating system, some more successfully than others. Google has seemingly closed this integration gap with its new Pixel smartphones, the first phones "made by Google." The Pixels, successors to Google's Nexus 5X and 6P and manufactured to Google's specifications by HTC, are designed by Google and integrate the Android operating system into the hardware. Pixel will come in two sizes, 5- and the XL 5.5-inch, and go on pre-order today. Both phones will be available in either 32GB ($649, $769) or 128GB ($749, $869) versions, in Quite Black, Very Silver and Really Blue, a limited edition version. There was no specific date given for actual shipping or availability. Spec-wise, both Pixel sizes run the latest Android Nougat 7.1 operating system, are powered by the latest Snapdragon 821 quad-core 2.15GHz processor, and include 4GB of RAM. The 5-inch Pixel is equipped with a 1080p AMOLED screen and is powered by a 2770mAh battery, while the larger 5.5-inch Pixel XL is fronted by a quad HD AMOLED panel and packs a 3450mAh cell; figure around 13-14 hours of combined Wi-Fi/internet use and/or video viewing. Plus, you'll be able to get 7 hours of battery life with just 15 minutes of charging. Also included is the Google Duo video calling app, which can be used to make video calls between Android and Apple devices. Like Apple, Google has eschewed the phone's headphone, opting instead for a single USB-C jack, a growing trend in Android flagship models, such as the Motorola Moto Z. However, unlike Apple, Google will not be including a USB-C-to-3.5mm headphone jack adapter with the Pixel. Pixel Plusses One advantage of Google's end-to-end integrated "phone by Google" approach is the built-in nature of Google Assistant. Like Siri on iPhone or Alexa on the Amazon Echo, you merely need to utter "ok Google" or another "hot word," and you'll be able to not only ask it standard information questions but actually control phone functions, such as finding a specific photo, playing a specific song or even make restaurant reservations.   While these Google Assistant voice-activated actions have been available before, the integrated nature of the Google Assistant means the whole system will be easier to upgrade as Google adds more artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language conversation capabilities to Assistant, along with automatic periodic OS updates. Aside from voice control, Google claims that Pixel includes the highest rated smartphone camera ever, especially in low light, a traditional smartphone camera weakness. Both Pixels feature 12.3MP rear cameras with an f/2.0 aperture and a large 1.55 micron pixel sensor and can shoot in both 4K and 2K with both 240- and 120-frame slow motion, along with f/2.4 8MP/1.4 micron front imagers with full HD video capabilities. Pixel also can capture action via Smartburst, which takes a rapid-fire sequence of shots (and it will pick out the one that is most in focus for you automatically); Lens Blur lets you capture shallow depth of field and bokeh effects, and there also are new exposure controls. As a bonus, Google also will supply free unlimited storage on Google Photos for all videos and photos, stored in full resolution. On the rear of the Pixels is a fingerprint sensor; swiping once unlocks the phone, swiping again – once the Google "Move" function is activated in Settings – opens up your notifications. Finally, the Pixels are compatible with Daydream View, Google's virtual reality system. Along with the Pixel, Google also announced new Daydream View headsets. To protect your Pixel, Google is adding new customized Live Cases, which can be created to a match a live wallpaper, designed with Google Earth and Google Trends, or one is a range of static colors. We'll be going hands on with the Pixel phone and reporting back in the coming weeks on whether the it should be your next Android phone.  [Image Credit: Google] Discussion Leave a Comment Here Our Latest Reviews The Best Humidifier for Medium & Large Rooms Crane Digital Warm & Cool Mist Humidifier EE-6902 The Best Instant Camera Fujifilm Instax Mini 70 Instant Camera Review of the Philips Pasta Maker Philips Pasta Maker The Best Beard Trimmer Panasonic ER-GB80 The Best Wi-Fi Router Linksys EA7500 New Articles on Techlicious How to Take Better Photos with Your iPhone The Best Humidifier for Medium & Large Rooms 7 Great Bluetooth Headphones Under $50 5 Tech Accessories That Make Perfect Stocking Stuffers How to Hide Your Home Theater iPhone & iPad Users: Beware of Fake Shopping Apps The Best TV under $500 Holiday Card Sites That Mail Cards for You © 2015 Techlicious LLC.

Stone’s Words Ring Truer Than Ever in ‘All Governments Lie’ By Jordan Riefe The Polarized Public: Why Our Government Is So Dysfunctional By Alan Abramowitz Shrill $26.00 Fitted T-Shirt $22   Assange Promises ‘Significant’ Leak Before Election, Urges Journalists to Lend a Hand Posted on Oct 4, 2016 Screen shot via YouTube By Emma Niles Another trove of secret documents will soon be released by the notorious whistleblowing organization WikiLeaks. In a Berlin news conference Tuesday morning, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said that over the next 10 weeks the website will release documents pertaining to U.S. foreign policy, Google and the U.S. electoral system. “We hope to be publishing every week for the next 10 weeks,” Assange explained, speaking via video link to a news conference audience. “We have on schedule—and it’s a very hard schedule—all the U.S. election-related documents to come out before November 8. Upcoming series include significant material on war, on arms, on oil, on Google, on the U.S. election and on mass surveillance.” However, many observers were let down by Assange’s proclamations, as speculation had been that WikiLeaks would disclose documents at the news conference, possibly about Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. One YouTube live stream, in describing the news conference, declared, “Assange is expected to make an announcement and release information that could be potentially damaging to Hillary Clinton’s Presidential campaign.” The Verge reports: Advertisement Square, Site wide There was a lot of build-up to today’s news conference, in anticipation of what had been billed as an “October surprise” that could swing the US presidential election. Instead, WikiLeaks devoted most of the event to recounting its most notorious releases and responding to criticism levied against it. Assange acknowledged the anticipation of a bombshell release in a winding address to reporters, though he declined to say whether the upcoming leaks would tilt the election toward Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. The news conference celebrated WikiLeaks’ 10th anniversary. In the briefing Assange addressed the organization’s successes and setbacks. The website Heavy writes: Assange started out by saying that over the last 10 years, Wikileaks has had about 10 million documents with 10 [billion] words. “It corresponds to approximately 3,000 documents a day on average. That’s a hell of a lot of work.” “Some of our sources have suffered terrible consequences in the United States.” He mentioned Chelsea Manning being among those. “It teaches you something about the structure of power,” he said. Assange then moved on to the coming leaks. “The material that WikiLeaks is going to publish before the end of the year is of a significant moment,” he said. He acknowledged the problems WikiLeaks faces, particularly a shortage of staff and resources. “We are going to need an army to defend us from the pressure that is already starting to arise,” he said. Those pressures, he continued, were largely directed against his asylum status in Ecuador’s London embassy, where he has lived since June of 2012. Additionally, Assange said WikiLeaks requires more media connections. In order to get the new material out, the organization needs journalists to reach out, he said. “Journalists who are interested in [these] subjects, please write to press@wikileaks.org.” He said WikiLeaks’ publishing will continue regardless of his asylum status, even if he must resign as editor in chief. Assange was silent on whether the forthcoming documents would target Clinton’s campaign. The Verge continues: Asked whether the upcoming releases would “destroy” Clinton, Assange appeared to downplay expectations. “Are upcoming publications significant in relation to the US election? Yeah, we think they’re significant,” he said. “Do they show interesting features of US power factions and how they operate? Yes, they do.” Assange denied accusations that he and his organization are specifically targeting Clinton and the Democratic Party. “I certainly feel sorry for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump,” he said. “These are two people who are tormented by their ambitions, in different ways.” In view of the bombshells that WikiLeaks has dropped at times in the past, the upcoming leaks well may have some political significance. “We’re in an enviable position but also a difficult position of having more than a million documents to get through, of many different sources,” Assange said. “We will be beginning the first publication in [this] series this week, and we’re going to post by the hour.” Watch the entire news conference below.

By Christina Beck, Staff October 4, 2016 Save for later Saved A test drone sits after making a UPS delivery to Children's Island in Marblehead, Mass. Rodrique Ngowi/AP View Caption About video ads View Caption of Just when you thought that the prospect of drone deliveries could not get more exciting, Google’s Alphabet figured out how to deliver burritos by drone. Alphabet’s burrito delivery experiment, Project Wing, is already making food deliveries to the campus of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. In the future, researchers say that the delivery drones could be used to deliver food, batteries, and other emergency supplies to emergency workers in disaster areas. "That was a fun novelty to experience," university worker Ingrid Mans, who experienced food delivery via the experiment, told Bloomberg. "It would be cool to see it applied to more important things than fast-food delivery though." Recommended: 40 iPhone tips and tricks everyone should know A recent test on Virginia Tech’s campus saw Project Wing drones pick up burritos from a hidden Chipotle food truck and deliver them directly to the people who had ordered them. 40 iPhone tips and tricks everyone should know Photos of the Day Photos of the Day 11/18 Currently, Project Wing tests are controlled, and very secretive. Yet while the project is able to test out its technology in a controlled environment for now, Alphabet will have to deal with flight patterns, regulations, and planning if the service goes mainstream. The company plans to share information with the Federal Aviation Administration, in order to help the FAA regulate delivery drones properly. Project Wing researchers must also determine how to ensure safety around the drones themselves – for the tests on Virginia Tech’s campus, viewers are kept away from harm by safety netting and personnel, a scenario unlikely to be repeated in real world delivery situations. Google is just one of several companies exploring the exciting possibilities of drone delivery. Online retailer Amazon has been exploring drone delivery for some time, with vice president of global public policy Paul Misener telling the House Oversight Committee in 2015 that delivery drones were on their way. In April 2015, Amazon received FAA approval to begin testing drone delivery. Wal-Mart followed in October.   “Drones have a lot of potential to further connect our vast network of stores, distribution centers, fulfillment centers and transportation fleet,” Wal-Mart spokesman Dan Toporek said in a statement at the time. “There is a Walmart within five miles of 70 percent of the U.S. population, which creates some unique and interesting possibilities for serving customers with drones." This summer, Amazon announced a partnership with Britain's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), allowing the online retailer to test drive its autonomous aerial technology and its delivery capabilities. Yet although there is most definitely interest in drone delivery, regulations lag far behind technology, particularly in the United States. The FAA has placed strict regulations on commercial drone testing in the United States, and while the regulatory body was expected to develop guidelines for drone regulation by last September, it failed to meet that goal and delivered the rules about a year over deadline. Food and parcel delivery are just two of the many drone uses that experts foresee for the future. “There are lots of good uses for drones that will come to pass: using them for inspections, for law enforcement, for agriculture, for delivering medicine to isolated areas,” Richard Whittle, author of the book "Predator: the Secret Origins of the Drone Revolution,” told The Christian Science Monitor last year.

Beck Diefenbach/Reuters View Caption About video ads View Caption of Google has made its first independent foray into the smartphone market with Pixel, a device that could rival Apple’s iPhone in terms of capability. The debut marks Google’s entrance as a product leader into a $400 billion smartphone market, where other companies, especially Apple, have established loyal customer bases and improved products through several models of trial and error. Entering the scene in 2016 is a risky launch for Google, but could provide the company with a way to ensure continued use of its web services and future projects. "It is early days but we've committed to this mission," Google CEO Sundar Pichai said. "But it's equally important to get it into the hands of our users, and that's what today is about." Recommended: 40 iPhone tips and tricks everyone should know The company unveiled both the Pixel and its slightly larger counterpart the Pixel XL Tuesday, which will sell for between $649 and $869. The device is the first phone Google has created entirely in-house, a departure from the strategy taken with Nexus, a phone that resulted out of collaboration between Google and outside smartphone makers. 40 iPhone tips and tricks everyone should know Photos of the Day Photos of the Day 11/18 With a voice-commanded assistant, the world’s fastest camera, and unlimited cloud photography storage, some of the features not only mimic, but threaten to exceed those of the iPhone.    Of course, that was part of Google’s plan. In April, the company reorganized its hardware groups under a single division so that designers and engineers behind Google Glass, Chromecast, and Pixel would all be on the same page. The move creates a more unified cross-product strategy, something Apple has seen a great deal of success in building. The phones will include a feature called Google Assistant, a voice-activated tool similar to Apple’s Siri. Built by a company that’s made a name for itself synonymous with searching, the feature remembers what users search and offers suggestions based on the criteria. As for camera and video, Google says Pixel’s is the best ever implemented on a smartphone, with the ability to capture photos faster than even the iPhone 7. Because Google is retaining full control of the devices’ software, it will likely provide major updates frequently, and monthly updates to security features. In addition to making a product that iPhone users might find appealing, Google will also rollout an  app to facilitate the transition between devices for customers, allowing them to transfer contacts, photos, music, videos, messages, and calendar reminders between an old iPhone device and a new Google one. The Pixel phones will also come with a cable that makes the transfer even faster and less prone to wireless connection errors. Even with competing features, it’s hard to say if Google can surpass Apple. iPhone users have proved extremely loyal to the company, sticking by the products even when only 28 percent of customers saw the iPhone as the best product on the market. Whether or not the buzz around Pixel can compete with the latest iPhone rollouts waits to be seen.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad Google takes on Apple, Amazon with new hardware push By Reuters Published: 19:37 EST, 4 October 2016 | Updated: 19:37 EST, 4 October 2016 e-mail By Julia Love SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's Google on Tuesday announced a new "Pixel" smartphone and a suite of new consumer electronics products for the home, planting itself firmly in the hardware business and challenging Apple Inc's iPhone at the high end of the $400 billion global smartphone market. The string of announcements - including the $649 Pixel, a smart speaker for the living room dubbed "Home," a virtual reality headset, and a new Wi-Fi router - is the clearest sign yet that Google intends to compete head-to-head with Apple, Amazon.com Inc and even manufacturers of phones using its own Android mobile operating system. Company executives, echoing Apple's longstanding philosophy, said they were striving for tighter integration of hardware and software. "The thinking is that if we can work on hardware and software together, we can innovate much better," Google hardware chief Rick Osterloh said in an interview with Reuters, citing a recent reorganization that united once-disparate hardware teams. Under the new structure, the company has begun to take a much more integrated approach to things like supply chain management and design, added Mario Queiroz, a vice president of product management. "The learnings from one product are benefiting another product," he said. Unlike earlier Google phone efforts under the Nexus brand, the Pixel devices are designed and developed by Google from the start, although Taiwan's HTC Corp will serve as the contract manufacturer. SWIPE AT APPLE Taking another page from the Apple playbook, Google said it would work exclusively with a single carrier in the United States, Verizon Communications Inc, on the Pixel, emulating Apple's agreement to launch the original iPhone with AT&T Inc. That deal gave Apple unprecedented control over the look of the phone and how it worked. Shares of Alphabet closed up 0.3 percent, while Verizon fell 1.2 percent. The phone comes in two sizes, and its high-end camera is one of few distinguishing features, analysts said. The phones come in black, blue and silver and will be able to get up to a seven-hour charge in 15 minutes. Pre-orders begin on Tuesday. "Aside from the camera, the new Google Pixels are pretty undifferentiated compared to Samsung and iPhone seventh generation phones," industry analyst Patrick Moorhead said. While the new phones are clearly aimed at competing with the iPhone - Google executives took several swipes at Apple in their on-stage remarks - analysts said Android rivals like Samsung Electronics could be the biggest victim if the Pixel takes off. Google's strategy of licensing Android for free and profiting from embedded services such as search and maps made Android the dominant mobile operating system with some 89 percent of the global market, according to IDC. But Apple still rules the high end of the market, and Google has long been frustrated by the emergence of many variations of Android and the inconsistent experience that has produced. Pushing its own hardware will likely complicate its relationship with Android licensees, analysts said. ALL-PURPOSE ASSISTANT Google kicked off the event Tuesday by touting the Google Assistant, the company's voice-activated artificial intelligence system and its answer to Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa. The presenter showed how a customers could make a restaurant reservation with a few phrases spoken into the phone. The assistant will be embedded into the Pixel and Home products and is being positioned as the central feature in a family of integrated hardware and software products. It is one of a handful of similar assistants that are vying for supremacy as more people search the web and make purchases online using voice commands, which may eventually supplant keyboards and touchscreens as the primary means of controlling digital devices. While Google is often cited as the leader in artificial intelligence, Amazon stole a march on the company with its Alexa-powered Echo home speaker system, a surprise hit. The Home device and the Echo have many of the same features. Google's "Daydream View" virtual reality headset, meanwhile, puts the company in competition with Facebook Inc, owner of Oculus. The device, which works with an Android phone, is far cheaper and simpler. It will be available in November for $79, in time for the end-of-year shopping season. Home will also be available in November for $129, including a six-month trial of ad-free YouTube. Google also unveiled a new version of its Chromecast digital media player and a router dubbed Google Wifi, both boasting the same sleek, minimalist design as the Home product. "These look like products from a single company," said Queiroz, the Google executive.

Posted 1 month ago. Roz Edward, Michigan Chronicle Managing Editor Leave a comment Today, Google took to the stage at its San Francisco headquarters to show the world what its been working on for the past year. Aside from the expected new phones, Google is also looking toward the future with a major push in Artificial Intelligence to make it even easier to communicate with the internet. Check out the biggest announcements from Google’s event below: Google Assistant Google Assistant is learning a second language with upcoming Hindi support https://t.co/oUgszHukT4 pic.twitter.com/iKGSsT96pJ — The Verge (@verge) September 28, 2016 The first person to hit the stage was Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai, who set the tone for what Google hopes to be an artificial intelligence-fueled future. That’s where Google Assistant comes in to make communicating with your phone much simpler. With Google’s immense search catalog, translation, and image recognition, its artificial intelligence is leap years ahead of the competition. You can, of course, launch Spotify within the search app, call an Uber, and even decide which sort of vehicle you want without even opening the app. Pixel Phones Meet #Pixel — the first phone designed inside and out by Google. #madebygoogle pic.twitter.com/xGAWjAbFXK — Google (@google) October 4, 2016 The one hardware announcement we were expecting proved to be even more eventful as the Google’s Pixel phone is its first in-house-made smartphone. The announcement didn’t come without a few shots thrown at Apple with the mentions of a headphone jack still being present and the absence of an unsightly camera bump. Like its predecessor, the Pixel features a finger print scanner on the rear alongside what Google is calling the best camera ever on a smartphone. Pixel’s camera has a DXOMark rating of 89, and Apple’s iPhone 7 got a rating of 86. The Pixel comes in “Quite Black,” “Very Silver,” and “Really Blue. It also comes in two sizes, and is available on October 13.   Daydream View Google announces Daydream View, coming in November for $79 https://t.co/6yFrico69p #News #Google pic.twitter.com/OdMysdU2kQ — VRSource (@vrsourcecom) October 4, 2016 With Virtual reality, or VR, being the new wave for phone manufactures, Google decided to jump in on the fun. And in continuing the trend of the Pixel, it’s Google branded and is way sleeker than any of the pricier VR headsets you’ll find on the market. It looks more comfortable, too. The Day Dream View comes with a remote for added interaction, and though it can be stored in the headset when you aren’t using it, you’ll probably lose it in your couch cushion. Feature wise, you’ll be able to using Google street view and even go on tours of landmarks like the Taj Mahal. Even when you aren’t doing VR-intensive things, you can watch YouTube Videos and move with it. Priced at $79, it may be the best bang-for-your-buck VR headset right now. Google Home Google Home will be cheaper than the Amazon Echo, available in November https://t.co/4AuRAG0d45 pic.twitter.com/up2zjnuwnC — The Verge (@verge) October 4, 2016 Google’s most interesting announcement was the Google Home. Not only does it give you less of a reason to use your phone, but it has (creepy) the ability to do just about everything. For starters, it’s a nondescript speaker that sits in your crib and is always on. Just say “Okay Google” (or a self-programmed trigger) and ask away. It also plays your music when asked, and can even launch YouTube on your TV. In true Google fashion, it’s customizable, with different colors of interchangeable speaker grills being available. Priced at $129, Google Home should be available in the coming months.

Queiroz made the comments on the sidelines of Google’s fall hardware event in San Francisco, where the company officially introduced its new Google Home smart speaker. Google Home is a bit like Google’s version of Amazon’s Echo speaker; the device allows consumers to launch music playback, ask for news and weather reports, query their calendar or even add items to their shopping list, all with simple voice commands. Google Home is being powered by Google Assistant, which Google CEO Sundar Pichai described as the company’s attempt to “build each user his or her own personal Google.” Related Everything Google Announced at Its October 4 Hardware Event Variety was first to report last week that Google has been in talks with consumer electronics manufacturers to build their own versions of Google Home. Queiroz confirmed Tuesday that Google has had conversations with companies that have added Google’s Cast technology to their Wifi-connected speakers to also add Google’s Assistant. A source with knowledge of Google’s plans had told Variety that Google wouldn’t allow companies to add other assistants, like Amazon’s Alexa, to their hardware if they were using Google Cast. Queiroz declined  to comment on unannounced policies, but said that Google has in the past been willing to allow some promiscuity, for example by allowing speaker manufacturers to also use competing wireless streaming technologies like Apple’s AirPlay in addition to Cast. He added that companies may also add the Assistant to their hardware if they don’t use Cast. Google also announced an upcoming program Tuesday that will even allow hobbyists to add support for Google Assistant to their hardware projects. Queiroz went on to explain that Google plans to make Google Home support part of the Google Cast SDK, meaning that developers who have added support for Google’s Chromecast Audio streaming adapter to their music or podcast streaming apps will also be able to closely integrate these apps with Google Home at some point. For now, Google is only working with select partners on these kinds of direct integrations. All others will soon have another way to get onto Google Home: Google announced Tuesday that it will allow developers to build so-called “actions” for the Assistant in December, making it possible to define voice-based interactions to answer questions, launch media playback or even order products or services online.

But 2017's looking up – there'll be loads of IPOs, beams Intel Verizon boss: Yahoo! email hack 'is a big deal to us', we'll decide new price next month Intel throws the ball long with sports, VR and IoT cash injections In just 90 minutes on Tuesday morning, Google took an enormous leap into the hardware market, offering new products to compete with Sonos in the music streaming market, Roku in video streaming, Linksys in routers, Amazon in voice assistants, Oculus in virtual reality, and Apple in phones. The sheer depth and breadth of the offering is something that only a very, very few companies in the world would even consider. Sony, maybe, at a push. It's a huge shift for the data-hoarding company, and to pull it off it has hired top talent from outside the organization: former president of Motorola Rick Osterloh arrived in April; former Microsoft, Apple and Amazon exec David Foster arrived literally this week. Foster reports to Osterloh and Osterloh to Google CEO Sundar Pichai. To demonstrate the size of the move, Pichai opened the event, and showing just how far Google is looking to stretch, he barely even mentioned the products that he was there to showcase. The magic tie-in for Pichai is Google's artificial intelligence and machine learning tools: they will be the secret sauce in these new devices. A marriage of hardware and software that only Apple has ever successfully pulled off. And what a list. There is: The Pixel phone: a direct challenge to the iPhone. Google Home: Amazon's Echo but in a smaller, curvier format. Daydream virtual reality headset: cheaper and more comfortable than Oculus and others. Chromecast audio and video streaming: with multi-room support. Google Wifi: a mesh system of routers aimed at stealing an emerging market. Possibly one or two others that we've forgotten. Where to start... the new stuff. Take me home Google Home is an identikit version of Amazon's popular Echo – the voice-powered speaker and assistant. It will cost less than the Echo – $129 compared to $179. And based on our playing around with it, it may be better. Google's version is smaller – in fact, surprisingly small – and curved, made to look a little like a chunky candle. It offers everything the Echo does: streaming music; answering questions, working with smart home products, but threatens to offer more. Google Homes will work with one another, allowing music to be spread into different rooms on command – like the very popular Sonos music system. And they will work with both Google's AI systems, providing answers to questions, and its hardware – like the Chromecast. In a demo, Google VP product management, Rishi Chandra, walked through a scenario where he asked the Home (Google, you need to work on a better name) to play "that Shakira song from Zootopia." Google does the smart processing – the song is called Try Everything – and starts playing it. Now that is a remarkable jump and the kind of intuitive possibility that has made the Echo a success, but taken just one step further. Chandra also demoed the ability for Google to provide all sorts of useful things about you – culled from your calendar, email, contacts etc. It has also worked on the funky uses: "flip a coin" he asks Home. It responds with the sound of a coin being tossed and landing. "Tails," it responded. He also asked it to start playing a particular TV show on his TV – and it did, through his attached Chromecast. We spoke with Chandra after the main event. He has several Google Homes in his home and we walked through some of the issues that only someone who has an Echo in their home will know. It's the same for Google Home: sometimes it just doesn't understand what you're saying, and man is that frustrating. "It's not perfect, but we are making it better and better," he added enthusiastically. The only thing we remain unsure about is the quality of the sound. Despite Google setting up several home-like walled-off environments to demonstrate the hardware, it was still too crowded to get a good sense of the quality. If Google manages similar quality audio and similar quality voice recognition as the Echo, it is onto a winner. Downsides: it seems unlikely that the small Home will have anywhere near the quality sound that comes from a Sonos system, so the multi-room setup is nice but probably not a replacement. And of course, all the demos relied on everything being held on Google's servers. Just like Apple, Google has realized that to get a really great experience it basically needs to control every aspect it can. Working with third parties is tough – and you have to persuade them to bother. Likelihood of success for Google Home: High.

Apple's iPhone 7 has two new rivals, and they're looking seriously good. Today is a big day in the world of technology. The launch of Google's first in-house manufactured smartphones - the Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL - marks the first time the search giant has stood toe-to-toe with Apple on both hardware and software after years of partnering with third-party manufacturers like LG and Huawei. It means Apple has another, huge, rival to deal with in the smartphone space, and a pair of new phones taking the fight directly to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. You've probably seen the leaked pictures by now, and suffice to say these were no renders. In the metal, they're even more attractive. The glass and metal rear panel on each phone looks just different enough without appearing awkward or ugly. Essentially, the look of the Pixel is all Nexus 6P but sleeker, more attractive, even a touch outlandish, with its inset glass camera surround spanning half the entire rear panel, encompassing the camera and circular, centre-mounted fingerprint. The result is eye-catching - in a good way - and the rest of the physical design is up to snuff as well. Both the Pixel and Pixel Xl are surrounded by a slender, slightly squared-off aluminium frame. The power and volume rocker are in sensible positions on the right edge, the SIM tray and microSD slot on the left edge, the speakers are in the bottom left and right corners facing down, and a USB Type-C data/charge port delivering “up to seven hours of battery life in just 15 minutes” sits in between them. It's probably worth pointing out, too, that there's a 3.5mm headphone jack here, on the top edge. Overall, the design is neat, understated, solid and smart: everything you'd expect of a Pixel product in fact, and the fact it looks a little out of the ordinary is just a bonus. I'm a fan of the colours the phones come in, as well: "Quite Black", "Very Silver" and "Really Blue". Very knowing. Google Pixel and Pixel XL: Key specifications   Google Pixel Google Pixel XL Screen 5in, 1,080 x 1,920 5.5in, 1,440 x 2,560 Processor 2.1GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 2.1GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 RAM 4GB 4GB Storage microSD slot (up to 256GB) microSD (up to 256GB) Size (WDH) 70 x 8.6 x 144 mm 76 x 8.6 x 155mm Weight 143g 168g Software Android 7.1 Nougat Android 7.1 Nougat Rear camera 12MP, OIS 12MP, OIS Front camera 8MP 8MP Battery capacity 2,770mAh 3,450mAh Australian price from $1079 from $1269 Google Pixel and Pixel XL review: Core hardware Where Google's Nexus phones have succeeded in the past is by including a top-level specification at a price much lower than the equivalent, and from a hardware perspective. That's certainly true of the raw hardware specifications of 2016s Pixel phones. Both phones are identical in most of the important areas. Each has a 2.1GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor and 4GB of RAM forming the core performance partnership. The phones come in 32GB and 128GB variants and, in a welcome reintroduction of storage expansion capabilities, there's also a microSD slot in each allowing users to add up to 256GB. Music geeks with enormous local MP3 file collections the world over will rejoice. Google Pixel and Pixel XL review: Cameras The rear facing camera is a 12-megapixel unit, the same resolution as last year's Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X phones, but this time with optical image stabilisation to improve performance in low light. The front camera is an 8-megapixel snapper, outdoing Apple's iPhone. And it looks as if it might be quite good as well. Pre-launch, Google sent a Pixel to imaging experts DXOMark, who have awarded it a rating of 89 - that's one mark better than the Samsung Galaxy S7, no less and three in front of the iPhone 7. Google was also keen to push the speed of its camera app and the effectiveness of its "HDR+" processing algorithm, which is enabled by default. It smugly demonstrated the effectiveness of its optical image stabilisation for video capture, and announced that Pixel owners would get unlimited storage for photos and videos, at original resolution. Until now, unlimited storage has been available to all Google Photos users, but at reduced quality. Another nice touch is support for physical gestures in the camera app, in particular the ability to switch between front and rear cameras with a quick double twist of the wrist.  Battery capacity, as I mentioned earlier, is the only place the two phones differ, apart from the size of course. The smaller Google Pixel has a 2,770mAh battery while the Pixel XL has a 3,450mAh power pack. Whether this translates into better battery life on the bigger phone depends largely on how efficient the display is. My guess is that it will be better, but not by a huge margin.  Google Assistant and extra software features Both the Google Pixel and Pixel XL run Google's very latest operating system - that's Android Nougat - but there's one more thing it has waited until now to add. Google Assistant, which is effectively Google Now renamed and tweaked - forms the fulcrum of the firm's AI vision, and it's woven into the very fabric of everything you do with the Pixel. Assistant works in a slightly different way to how Google Now used to. To activate it, you can touch and hold the phone's home button or use the long-standing "OK Google" keyword. There's also a new graphic on the homepage to access the feature: instead of a wide box that stretches across the width of the screen, you get a compact circular icon in the top left corner, leaving more room for your app shortcuts. Effectively, it's an expanded, refined Google Now, and the new Pixel phones will be the first to get it. Other features include automatic software updates and a new tool for transferring across all the data and apps from your old phone. And, of course, the phone is "VR ready": just drop the phone into Google's new Daydream View headset, strap it to your face and you have access to a variety of new VR content, the whole of YouTube and Google Movies, plus games, a bunch of educational stuff and more. Google Pixel and Pixel XL review: Hands-on impressions With Google now going head to head with Apple, the big question is has the search giant cracked it? First impressions are immensely positive. As you'd expect for a smartphone running the very latest Qualcomm hardware and clean Android OS, it feels super slick to use. Most impressive, however, is the sheer quality and attention to detail in the design. Both phones are super slim at 8.6mm from glass to aluminium at the rear, and yet - unlike Apple's iPhones - eminently grippable. What do I mean by that? Simply that by introducing something as simple as slightly angled edges the phones feel less slippery in the hand, and less like you're going to drop them on the floor. The fact that the larger Pixel XL is lighter than its iPhone 7 Plus counterpart helps a lot, too, although the smaller Pixel is actually a touch heavier than the standard iPhone 7. That's probably because the smaller Pixel is a 5in phone where the iPhone 7 has a 4.7in screen. Google Pixel and Pixel XL review: Early verdict Google's two Pixel phones mark a major move for not only the company itself, but also the technology industry in general. It's disappointing, though, that Google apparently hasn't made any effort to keep the price down to a more reasonable level, and that may affect its long-term popularity. What we have here is a pair of smartphones that are precisely the same cost as the equivalent iPhones. How many phones this expensive can the market support? Only time will tell, but the phones themselves certainly look the part.

Wednesday 5 October 2016  | Comment Now Search Google, ask questions and play music using just your voice with Google Home. So what is Google Home? Good question. In its simplest form, it's a voice-controlled speaker that brings Google to your house. The idea behind it is Google Home will act as a passive digital assistant that gives users the ability to acces Google's huge knowledge just by saying "OK Google" and speaking to it as if it were a human. Here are some of the onstage examples from the Google Home launch event to give you an idea of how it's meant to be used:   Example 1: You're sitting on your couch, you lean over your shoulder and yell "OK Google, play me some Bruce Springsteen on Spotify" and bang, The Boss will start playing from Google Home. Example 2: "Ok Google, how do you say 'Can I have a beer please?' in Spanish" and Google will reply with "¿Una cerveza por favor?" in a matter of seconds. Example 3: "OK Google, can you add kids' vitamins to my shopping list?" ...you get the picture. You can customize your Google Home with a choice of 6 bases, in fabric or metal. #madebygoogle pic.twitter.com/qVWaneFlOK — Google (@google) October 4, 2016 Google Home doesn't just want to be an 'Any Question Answered' toy. It ambition is to be at the centre of your home. With Google Home you can control the following devices: Chromecast, Nest, Samsung SmartThings, Philips and IFTTT smart devices using just your voice. Google wants you to use voice commands such as "turn the heating up" when using you Nest device and similar commads for other IoT devices. When can I get Google Home? If you're in Australia, I have some bad news. You can't. Not yet, anyway and Google hasn't said when you can. Gits. However, if you're in the US, you're in luck. Google Home costs $130 and comes free with a six month trial of Google Red. Pre-order is available from Today. Shipping November 4th. What colours does Google Home come in?  Plastic shell devices are available in Mango, Marine and Violate. Metal devices in Carbon, Snow and Copper.

Google has finally brought 4K to its phenomenal Chromecast streamer with the Chromecast Ultra, a HDMI dongle with 4K, HDR and Dolby Vision support. Just like the 2015 Chromecast refresh and Chromecast Audio, the Chromecast Ultra is a puck-shaped device that's just a little bit thinner than a Mr. Kipling bakewell tart with a HDMI ribbon to plug it into your TV. The Chromecast Ultra plug also features an Ethernet port to help with the heavy lifting when streaming 4K content if your Wi-Fi network isn't fast enough to handle it. As you can imagine, Chromecast Ultra also works in exactly the same way as your other Chromecast devices and integrates with Google Home if you fancy asking your little voice-activated vase to throw on some Stranger Things. Chromecast Ultra is also 1.8x faster than the 2015 Chromecast, so no more hanging around for content to load when switching apps. All the same Chromecast apps work with the Chromecast Ultra and Netflix users can benefit from 4K HDR content straight away. No doubt other apps will follow, but the bigger question you need to ask yourself is, do you really need a Chromecast Ultra? Most 4K HDR TVs are smart TVs equipped with all the apps that support 4K, most of which will also be on Chromecast Ultra. If you have a 4K TV, why bother buying a £70 dongle to watch all the apps and services your TV already has?   Granted, there's definitely a market for people who want to stream their own 4K content easily to their TV. You could also argue that there may be a slew of Chromecast games apps people may want to play. However, the main draw is probably Sky's Now TV app which supports Chromecast but isn't included as a standard smart TV app – but that doesn't support Full HD streaming, let alone 4K. The Chromecast Ultra launches this November for $99 from the Google Play Store and will, presumably, end up at high-street retailers around the same time. We'll have a review up closer to the time, so make sure to check back closer to launch.

The venue was also witness to a bunch of of other new devices that included the Google WiFi router, Google Chromecast Ultra, and Google Dreamview VR. In this article, however, we will focus on the two new Google Pixel smartphones – the Pixel XL and the Pixel. As you may have guessed by now, Google Pixel is the evolution of Google’s Nexus series smartphones that have been around since the Google Nexus One was announced back in 2010. Just like its Nexus series, the Google Pixel smartphones too, run the “pure” version of Google’s Android operating system. This time, however, Google does claim that the devices have been designed “under one roof,” although the fact remains that the Pixel is made by Google’s longtime partner, HTC. Now that we are done with the introduction, let’s get down to business and talk about each of these devices, separately. Note that both the phones do get some common specifications as well which we will talk about later. Google Pixel Specifications We start off with the “normal” Google Pixel which is the smaller of the two handsets. The Google Pixel boasts of a 5-inch, full-HD, AMOLED display with a PPI density of 441. The device also features a mildly curved 2.5D Corning Gorilla Glass 4. While not the thinnest phone around, the Google Pixel is not very bulky either with the device being 8.5 mm thin at its thickest. The smaller Google Pixel smartphone gets a 2,770 mAh battery that claims to offer up to 19 days of standby time on LTE networks and 26 hours on 3G, It also claims 13 hours of internet usage time on both Wi-Fi and LTE. Video playback, too, has been rated for 13 hours. The phone does support fast charging and will charge for more than 7 hours of usage in just 15 minutes of charging. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rykmwn0SMWU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> Google Pixel XL Specifications As made evident by its name, the Google Pixel XL is the larger screened version of the Google Pixel. The Pixel XL gets a larger, 5.5- inch, Quad HD display which means it offers an ultra high PPI density of 534. Like its smaller sibling, the Pixel XL, too, gets a 2.5D Corning Gorilla Glass 4 layer at on the display for scratch protection. Even though it is larger than the Pixel, it is the same thickness measuring just 8.5mm at its thickest. Due to the larger size of the device, Google (HTC, rather) has managed to cram in a higher capacity battery, rated for 3,450 mAh on the Google Pixel XL. The larger battery offers up to 23 days of standby time on LTE networks, up to 32 hours on 3G. Internet usage time on both Wi-Fi and LTE is pegged at 14 hours. The phone can also play videos for up to 14 hours. Like its smaller sibling, the Google Pixel XL too gets fast charging and can be used for more than 7 hours after 15 minutes of fast charging. Common Specifications Being from the same family, both the Google Pixel and the Google Pixel XL feature quite a few common features. Let’s now see what those are. We start off with the design. One look at both the devices and you will note that both the devices do look quite similar to each other. In fact, the Google Pixel XL looks like a stretched version of the Pixel. Both of them feature a metal unibody design and come in two color options. Both the phones are powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 (MSM8996) Quad Core 2+2 Kryo processor and feature 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM as well. Both the devices come in two variants – one with 32GB of storage and a higher priced version that gets 128GB of onboard storage space. While the display sizes differ, both the displays offer 100 percent NTSC color gamut and boast of a 100000:1, super contrast ratio. 32 or 128GB As for the camera, Google has already gone on to claim that the cameras on the Pixel phones take the best pictures ever – which mind you, is a very tall claim. Both the devices feature a 12.3-megapixel main camera and uses Sony’s IMX378 sensor with support for Phase Detection Auto Focus as well as Laser Auto Focus. The f/2.0 aperture does mean you get decent low light shots. The front camera uses an 8-megapixel IMX179 sensor with and gets an f/2.4 aperture lens. Strangely, unlike most other high-end smartphones out there, the Pixel uses a fixed focus camera at the front! The main camera is capable of 4K video recording at 30 fps. The main camera also supports the following resolutions for video recording. 1080p @ 30fps, 60fps, 120fps 720p @ 30fps, 60fps, 240fps Like any self-respecting Android phone from 2016, the Google Pixel gets the Pixel Imprint which is just a fancy name for a back-mounted fingerprint sensor. The phone uses a USB Type-C port for charging and data transfer – and yes, there is a separate 3.5mm audio jack – just in case you were wondering. Both the handsets are single SIM devices and support up to CAT 11 LTE (600Mbps DL / 75Mbps UL) depending upon carrier coverage and carrier rollouts. As expected, both the phones run the newest version of Android – version 7.0 Nougat. It also comes preloaded with Google Assistant and the new apps Google Duo and Allo. When and How to buy The Google Pixel and the Pixel XL comes in two color options; Very Silver and Quite Black. There is a U.S. centric limited edition variant as well which is blue in color. The devices will also be launched along with a bunch of new cases that are highly customizable. Both the devices are available for pre-order starting today in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Germany, and Australia. The starting price of the device is $649 in the U.S. In India, pre-orders start October 13. So, are you getting one?

Resend activation e-mail Gear & Gadgets / Product News & Reviews Third time’s the charm: Google is trying to be a phone company, again Google's strategy is new, but the concept of a Google smartphone isn't. by Andrew Cunningham - Oct 4, 2016 11:19 pm UTC Login to bookmark 115 Enlarge Google Today, Google officially announced something that the tech world has known for months: it's launching a pair of high-end Pixel-branded smartphones, killing the Nexus program, and competing more explicitly with Apple and every other company that's making and selling Android phones. Google is definitely pushing itself as a hardware company like it never has before. But this is hardly the company's first effort to get into the smartphone hardware business. The first was the Nexus One, which drew iPhone comparisons when it was launched. But low sales almost killed the brand—Eric Schmidt said in 2010 that the Nexus One “was so successful [in helping Android along], we didn’t have to do a second one”—before it was resurrected and pointed at the developer-and-enthusiast niche. The second and more serious effort began in 2011, when Google bought Motorola for $12.5 billion. After clearing out the old Motorola’s product pipeline, in 2013 and 2014 the company introduced a series of high-end and midrange Moto phones that were critical darlings for their price tags, their focus on fundamentals, and their fast Android updates. These were three non-broken things that Lenovo promptly “fixed” after it bought Motorola from Google for just $2.9 billion three years later. Google made no mention of its Motorola experiment onstage today, even though the same guy who ran Motorola is now running Google’s hardware efforts. But the sense that all of this has happened before is just one of the contradictions of Google’s new mobile strategy. More importantly, the company’s actions and stated goals contradict one another, to the extent that I wonder just how committed Google is to its hardware plans and, on a related note, just how good its chances of success are. #MadeByGoogle Enlarge / Besides the name, Pixel phones have little in common with Pixel laptops and tablets. Ron Amadeo Google’s sales pitch for its new phones is distinctly Apple-esque: Pixels are the first phones designed from the ground up by Google, which gives Google the opportunity to tailor the hardware to better suit its software and vice versa. This is a departure from Google’s Nexus strategy, in which Google slapped Nexus branding on existing or near-complete products that one of its partners was already working on. Except, well, the Pixel phones are pretty Nexus-y. FCC filings show that they were clearly built by HTC, and as our own Ron Amadeo pointed out they appear to share components with HTC designs like the One A9. “Designed by Google” and “built by HTC” don’t need to be mutually exclusive. I don’t doubt that Google blessed each component and design choice individually or that it became involved in the design process much earlier than it normally would for a Nexus phone. And even if the Pixels are HTC phones with Google logos on them, that’s becoming an increasingly common move. HTC can make phones, but the mass market doesn’t care about its brand. Google has a mass-market brand but maybe didn’t want to start from zero to design a new phone. Fine. The trouble is, Google has actually designed some quality hardware all by itself. The Pixel Chromebooks were both lovely, though they were priced out of reach of anyone but ChromeOS die-hards. And even though the Pixel C tablet’s software has been rough, its hardware has the benefit of at least looking and feeling good. Chromecast is a Google effort, too, as are Daydream View and Google Home. Google can design its own hardware, and it says that it does. But the Pixel phones aren’t as Google-y as some of Google’s other devices, and they definitely don’t have the signature design touches of the other Pixel products (including the lightbar and the boxy-yet-still-appealing curves). This may be a springboard, the first step in a transition from the Nexus era to a new Pixel era. Google hardware chief Rick Osterloh says that he’s already seen photos from next year’s Pixel camera, so at a bare minimum Google has a roadmap that it’s in control of. But the way Google is hitting the “#MadeByGoogle” drum so hard is odd, given the Pixel’s obvious lineage. Exclusive features don’t mesh with Google’s business model Google’s hardware contradictions are puzzling but easily explained. The software contradictions are more troubling. One of the reasons Apple can get away with keeping iPhone prices the same every year even as Android phones get cheaper is that the company really is in full control of its hardware, software, and ecosystem. The iPhone is the only place to get iOS, it’s the only phone that offers tight integration with the Mac and other Apple products, and it’s the only place where you can get iOS apps. Few players in the Android market, Samsung aside, can do the same thing, since the primary differentiator is often price rather than any particular gimmick or spec. Google’s Hiroshi Lockheimer believes there’s room for another player in the high-end, high-margin phone market. That may be true, but when asked what Google intends to provide that other Android phone makers won't or can't (beyond intangibles like brand value), his answers were vague. Clearly, the Pixel is going to get a lot of things first: Android 7.1 will come to the Pixel before it’s even available as a developer preview for older Nexus and Pixel devices, to say nothing of OEMs who haven’t even started shipping Android 7.0 updates. The Google Assistant and Google’s new Pixel Launcher are both Pixel exclusives, at least for now. But Android’s success is built in part on how widespread it is, and Google’s business is built on casting wide nets that can collect lots of data. It might make sense to keep the Pixel Launcher exclusive to the Pixel phones to give Google’s phones their own unique look and feel and tighter integration with all of Google’s services. But the Assistant will almost certainly be available for other Android devices eventually, just as Google Now and Google Now On Tap (two services that have plenty of overlap with the Assistant anyway) already are. The Daydream VR platform is already open to other phone makers as long as they’re using Android 7.1. Google’s stuck in a place where it needs to give its own Android phones unique features to differentiate them from the crowd, which is doubly true since they’re being sold at iPhone and Galaxy prices instead of Nexus prices. But it makes most of its money by building out large userbases and making its products and services as available to as many people as is realistically possible. In that tug of war, Google will ultimately be pushed to do whatever is best for its bottom line, something that may damage its nascent phone business. Which kind of Google experiment will the Pixel phones be? Are we missing a part of Google’s strategy? The so-called "Andromeda" project, that long-rumored collision of Android and ChromeOS, could be part of it. But this whole hardware shift could just as easily be one more experiment from a company that loves to try new things without always committing to them. Gmail, Android, Chrome, Chromebooks, the Chromecast, and of course the search engine that forms the core of the company are all solid successes that Google is obviously committed to. Motorola, the Nexus Q, the Android Update Alliance, the Google Play Edition program, Google Hangouts, the OnHub, Google Buzz, Google Wave, Google+, Project Ara, Google Glass, Google TV, Google Reader, and any number of other initiatives swept under the rug during a “spring cleaning” phase were all eventually canceled or dramatically scaled back as the company’s strategy and personnel have changed. In which column do the Pixel phones belong? I don’t know. But if Google’s new hardware strategy doesn’t seem like it’s working, the company won’t be afraid to change it. Again.

Mobility Opinion Technology First look at Google’s new Samsung- and iPhone-killer, the Pixel Eric Emin Wood @ericewood Published: October 4th, 2016 Samsung Electronics Ltd. is about to lose a big chunk of the North American smartphone market. It’s difficult to reach any other conclusion after spending a few minutes with the Pixel, the new Android-powered smartphone developed in-house by Google Inc., which announced its entry into several key hardware markets in a big way today. For starters, the device doesn’t carry the explosive stigma now associated with Samsung’s most recent device, the Galaxy Note 7; and I can personally testify that its accompanying VR headset, the Daydream View, is a lot more comfortable to wear than Gear VR. I could actually see myself putting this on at night to help me fall asleep. And though visually the phone’s design screams “generic Android smartphone” – except, of course, for the stylized “G” at the back – it has a few tricks that set it apart. For example, much like the instinctive feel that rival Apple Inc. cultivates in its mobile products, many of the Pixel’s most common features can be accessed using intuitive gestures, such as tapping the power button twice to activate the rear camera, or giving the device a quick shake to activate the front camera if you’re shooting a selfie. Google has also added shortcuts to certain applications: holding down your finger on Google Maps, for instance, produces a prompt asking users if they will be leaving from work or home. Other apps are easily voice-activated – the Pixel is designed for Google’s much-touted new mobile assistant, and if it works it’s not hard to imagine users watching videos on YouTube by saying which clip they’d like to see, or listening to music by telling the device which setlist to play. While demonstrating the Pixel, Google’s Ravneet Takhar was able to get directions to Toronto’s C.N. Tower simply by saying he’d like to go there, and he could even add a destination by saying he’d like to visit a gas station or coffee shop along the way. Google’s Ravneet Takhar demonstrates the Pixel for ITBusiness.ca. Unfortunately, Google’s voice recognition software is far from perfect – it’s supposed to adapt to your voice, but when Takhar tried adding a “coffee stop” to his hypothetical journey Maps inserted a detour that led to a Los Angeles restaurant, and specifying “Tim Hortons” simply brought up the chain’s breakfast menu – but then, it’s not like Siri is perfect either. In fact, Apple might want to keep an eye on Google’s new hardware push in general. While the Cupertino, Calif. icon has a few advantages that Google could never hope to match – a reputation for tighter security, for one, and an exceptionally loyal customer base, for two – the Pixel matches, and arguably surpasses, the iPhone 7’s two most notable features: an exceptionally high-quality camera and missing headphone jack. At the very least, pictures taken with the Pixel appear to be an improvement over those shot with the single-lens iPhone 7, while the 3.5 mm headphone jack is the only feature that’s “satisfyingly not new,” per Google’s cheeky reference in the Pixel’s first promotional video. Forget the iPhone – that’s a nicer image than my SLR. One other potentially useful feature could be the worldwide, 24/7 customer support that Google has promised for Pixel users. Anytime they need help, day or night, a special chat feature is available that will connect users to a Google expert via text, phone, or video, complete with screen-sharing so that if they can’t describe their problem or follow the expert’s solution, the expert can solve it for them. The Pixel’s U.S. release has been scheduled for November, and while no Canadian release date has been set, Google staff told us it will be out in Canada before the end of the year.

The finding, published in the paper "The Effect of DNS on Tor's Anonymity," was a collaborative effort between researchers at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden; Karlstad University in Karlstad, Sweden; and Princeton University in Princeton, N.J. In a blog post on the topic, one of the researchers, Philipp Winter, postdoctoral researcher in computer science at Princeton University, said a significant fraction of Tor exit relays send DNS requests to Google's public domain name resolvers, which creates a centralized point of control and observation where DNS monitoring can be used in an attack -- something Tor was designed to avoid. "It is well-understood that low-latency anonymity networks such as Tor cannot protect against so-called global passive adversaries," Winter wrote. "We define such adversaries as those with the ability to monitor both network traffic that enters and exits the network. Then the adversary can run a correlation attack, meaning that it can match packets that go into the network to packets that leave it, or in other words, it can link a client's identity (her IP address) to her activity (e.g., visiting Facebook), and thus, break anonymity." Lance James, chief scientist at Flashpoint, told SearchSecurity DNS monitoring attacks have commonly been an issue for Tor. "This attack isn't completely new in nature. There is research from multiple parties that have known this for a while, specifically using Google's 8.8.8.8 [resolver,]" James said. "In reality, Google's DNS probably has the widest view of Tor-leaked traffic on the internet, and with a data set of that size and detail one can do amazing research with traffic analysis -- not that they would per se." According to the research, Google's public DNS servers can at times comprise 40% of exit bandwidth of Tor users, which they said is "an alarmingly high number for a single organization" and that Tor relay operators "should take steps to ensure that the network maintains more diversity into how exit relays resolve DNS domains." "We show how an attacker can use DNS requests to mount highly precise website fingerprinting attacks," researchers wrote. "Mapping DNS traffic to websites is highly accurate even with simple techniques, and correlating the observed websites with a website fingerprinting attack greatly improves the precision when monitoring relatively unpopular websites." James said these DNS monitoring techniques aren't trivial and require access to controlling the autonomous system network like Google or an ISP. "This attack will likely be deployed at a specific target, not a general Tor user. In many cases in the U.S., if you are targeted specifically it is due to breaking the law or doing something that causes concern to national security," James said. "In other countries this rule tends to apply as well. Dissidents that expect protection from Tor could be in danger, but in the reality, using Tor in itself is already a fingerprint and this attack would not matter if the adversary is at the ISP level."  Winter said this research shouldn't necessarily create immediate cause for concern. "Adversaries that can already monitor large fractions of the internet -- for many people, the biggest threat -- will not do any better with our attack," Winter wrote. "Instead, we investigate how 'semi-global' adversaries can get the most out of the data they have. Finally, the Tor Project is already working on techniques to make website fingerprinting attacks harder." Next Steps Learn more about research uncovering malicious probing of Tor hidden services.

BUSINESS Google's new household gadget is all about search Google Home Google Google Home, the tech giant's new household assistant, opens another way for the firm to collect data about its users and help them find what they're looking for. Google Home, the tech giant's new household assistant, opens another way for the firm to collect data about its users and help them find what they're looking for. (Google) Tracey Lien Google has long been the king of search, building its empire by answering questions, giving directions and helping people settle arguments with its vast database of facts. But as more people search using their voice — verbally asking questions to Apple’s Siri or Amazon Echo’s Alexa — instead of typing queries into their phones or laptops, the tech giant risks ceding some of that dominance. To future-proof itself from competitors, the Mountain View, Calif., tech firm announced Tuesday a new slate of electronic devices that support voice search and come pre-installed with Google Assistant, the company’s artificial intelligence bot that can do a wide variety of things, including answering queries and making restaurant reservations.  “[Google Assistant] will be a two-way conversation, a natural dialogue between our users and Google,” said Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive. “It will be universal, available when users need it to help them. Our goal is to build a personal Google for each and every user.” Google shows off new phone, virtual reality headset and home assistant Tracey Lien Gadgets have never been Google’s specialty, but they could play a big role in the tech giant’s future.  The Mountain View, Calif. firm on Tuesday announced a new smartphone, virtual reality headset and household helper — a suite of devices that could help lure users to Google’s software and search... Gadgets have never been Google’s specialty, but they could play a big role in the tech giant’s future.  The Mountain View, Calif. firm on Tuesday announced a new smartphone, virtual reality headset and household helper — a suite of devices that could help lure users to Google’s software and search... (Tracey Lien) To that end, Alphabet Inc., Google’s parent company, also rolled out its answer to the Amazon Echo — a cylindrical household gadget called Google Home. Google is positioning the device as the ultimate virtual home assistant, with the ability to answer spoken queries, play music from YouTube, Spotify, Pandora, and iHeartRadio, use voice controls for connected home devices from the Google-owned Nest, Samsung and Phillips, and even control Netflix. Just say "OK, Google" in its presence and it's at your service. Answering questions plays to Google’s strengths, but hardware has generally been a weakness for the company. Its Nexus smartphones lagged behind the iPhone and Samsung’s Galaxy phones, and its entry into augmented reality via the face-mounted Google Glass was a much-mocked flop. This latest push into hardware is less about wanting to compete as a hardware maker, according to analysts, and more about being where users are when they’re asking questions. “Google wants to showcase that it will continue to be a relevant platform to access information on whatever connected device consumers use moving forward,” said Thomas Husson, vice president and principal analyst at research firm Forrester. “Search is increasingly taking place in many more places, via many more devices and through new interfaces,” Husson said, so to stay relevant in the long run, Google is finding ways to embed Google Assistant into people’s lives.  Rick Osterloh, who heads Google’s hardware division, said Tuesday at the company’s San Francisco product event that his company sees its products sitting at “the intersection of hardware and software, with artificial intelligence at the center.” “Building hardware and software together … allows Google to be helpful to people wherever they need us, no matter the context or form factor,” he said. The hardware, then, is really an means to an end.  That may explain why Google is undercutting its biggest competitor on price: Google Home  is available for pre-order for $129, $50 less than the Amazon Echo. The Amazon Echo can perform many of the same functions: It plays music, controls other devices and enables users to search with their voice. It alone lets users speak to place orders on Amazon, hail Uber rides by voice and hear Amazon Kindle books read aloud by AI bot Alexa. My ride in a self-driving Uber; or how I learned to stop worrying and trust the algorithm Tracey Lien Parked outside a warehouse by the Allegheny River was Uber’s vision of the future: 14 Ford Fusions, each mounted with conspicuous cameras, antennae and sensors. A lumpy lidar unit, which uses light to map its surroundings, spun atop each car’s roof like a high-tech propeller hat.  Stylish?

Not... (Tracey Lien) That strong e-commerce bent has helped Amazon convince customers of the gadget’s utility. But the fact that users regularly ask Echo factual questions suggests Google may have a compelling case for its product as well.  “The key thing for Google is getting the data on the questions people are asking and the needs they have,” said Matthew Quint, director of the Center on Global Brand Leadership at Columbia Business School. “Google’s model is ‘We connect you to everything, we’re the funnel, so if you want something, ask Google how to get it done.’ That’s what they want.” At its core, Google is in the advertising business and it has built its wealth studying user activity and selling ads based on the data it collects. The more time people spend interacting inside the Google ecosystem, whether it’s on their phones, in their homes, or on their laptops, the stronger Google’s business becomes.  While Siri and the Amazon Echo may have had a head start, Quint believes the market for voice-controlled devices and voice search is nascent enough that Google can still establish itself as the voice search of choice.  “By getting in now, they have a chance to be a leader on the content side,” Quint said, “which is a much more natural play for Google.” Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Northern Californians who voted for Trump feel forgotten by the state, Megyn Kelly's new book took a new turn due to the elections, Twitter is trying to clean up, and the Crystal Cathederal is getting a new look.

Along with the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, Google also showed off a new 4K Chromecast, a router, a fabric-covered VR headset and a virtual assistant. In the process of launching all of this new hardware, Google had to make a difficult choice. As of today, the Nexus line is, for all intents and purposes, dead. DON'T MISS: 10 best features of Google’s brand new Pixel phones Shortly after the "Made by Google" event ended, Google puts its products up for preorder on the Google Store. In doing so, it pushed 2015's Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P smartphones out of the store (along with the Nvidia Shield, the Mattel View-Master VR Starter Pack, the Goggle Tech C1-Glass VR Viewer and the Dell Chromebook 13) as Android Police noted earlier this afternoon. In fact, if you search for "Nexus" on the Google Store now, the only results that show up are Live Cases for the previous three Nexus phones... none of which are still available directly from Google. Factor in the discontinuation of the Nexus Player earlier this year, and it's clear that Google is killing the Nexus brand. Even the Google Nexus Twitter account is saying farewell: https://twitter.com/googlenexus/status/783360528986931204 https://twitter.com/googlenexus/status/783360665108951040 If you own a Nexus device, Google will "continue to support" it (for the time being), but don't expect to see a Nexus 7 popping up on store shelves next fall. Pixel is the future of Google's phone line, and Nexus has run its course.

Weiss  |  Posted 2016-10-04 Print               The Pixel and Pixel XL phone models, which include hardware and software designed and engineered by Google, start at $649. Google's long-rumored Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, as well as its all-new Daydream View VR headset, were finally unveiled Oct. 4 after months of speculation, bringing new entries to both markets from the giant in online search. The smartphones, which are available immediately for preorder, start at $649 for the Pixel phone, which has a 5-inch display and 32GB of onboard storage, or at $769 for a Pixel XL, which has a 5.5-inch display and 32GB of storage. A 128GB Pixel is $749, while a 128GB Pixel XL is $869. The new Daydream View headset is priced at $79 and will arrive in November. Consumers who preorder and pay for their new Pixel smartphones will get a free Daydream View headset through a promotional code with their purchase, while supplies last, according to Google. The smartphones are designed and engineered by Google and are being offered for sale through Verizon and Google.com. The Pixel has a 5-inch full HD AMOLED display, which is covered with Corning Gorilla Glass 4, a 2,770mAh battery and is 5.6 inches tall, 2.7 inches wide and 0.3 inches thick. It's larger stablemate, the Pixel XL, has a 5.5-inch quad HD AMOLED display, a Corning Gorilla Glass 4 cover, a 3,450mAh battery and is 6 inches long, 2.9 inches wide and 0.34 inches thick. The phones are the first Google devices to include the latest Google Assistant services built-in to assist consumers in their everyday lives. Both phone models feature a metal unibody design with curved edges, a Snapdragon 821 MSM8996 quad-core processor, 4GB of LPDDR4 memory, a 12.3-megapixel auto-focus, rear main camera with an f/2.0 lens and an 8-megapixel front-facing, fixed-focus camera with an f/2.4 lens. Both handsets can capture and play 4K video as well as 1080p and 720p video. Both models also include a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor for device and user security, fast charging that can provide up to 7 hours of use from a 15-minute charge, a USB Type-C port, a 3.5mm headset jack, a single SIM receptacle and a single bottom-firing speaker. Also included is 24/7 technical support for the handsets through a preloaded app that gives tech support personnel the ability to examine the phone remotely after the owner consents to the assistance. In addition, both handsets will include Google's new Google Nougat operating system with automatic updates in the background and free unlimited storage of photos and videos at original quality and full resolution through Google Photos. Buyers can also obtain their Pixel or Pixel XL handsets with a free SIM card that will work with Google's Project Fi mobile phone services. A 2-year device protection plan is available for $99. The handsets come in Quite Black or Very Silver colors in 32GB or 128GB versions, but only in a 32GB version in the other color choice, called Really Blue. The phones also come with new transfer tools to help new owners move all of their photos, emails, contacts and other personal data to their new Pixel handset from their old smartphone. The Pixel phones are also built to be fully compatible with the new Daydream View VR headset, giving users the ability to consume a wide variety of VR content that is being offered by Google and its partners. The Daydream View VR Headset Unlike competing VR headsets, the Daydream View is made using soft fabrics and materials that are comfortable on a wearer's face, while also being up to 30 percent lighter than other viewers, according to Google. To connect a Pixel phone to the headset, the user opens the latch on the viewer, places their Pixel phone inside, shuts the hatch and the phone and headset communicate automatically to configure the devices. Users will be able to see YouTube videos, Google Street View content, Google Play Movies and more at launch, with more than 50 partners bringing additional content before end of year and more on the way, according to Google. The Daydream View headset can be worn over glasses and comes with a hand-operated controller that stores inside the device. Additional Daydream-compatible smartphones will be announced by other companies in the future so that non-Pixel users can also use the viewer. Daydream View will be available in the color Slate at launch in November, while Snow and Crimson colors will be available later in 2016.

A spokesperson confirmed last month: 'After four amazing years on Made in Chelsea, Lucy feels that now is the right time to explore some other exciting opportunities and projects that she is passionate about.

The floral garment benefitted from a pop of colour as Laura accessorised with a black, red and gold clutch bag.   Other attendees included diver Tom Daley, Pop star FEMME, musician Rebecca Ferguson and magician Dynamo.

The unveiling of Google's in-house designed phone came as part of an expanded hardware move by the US company, which also revealed details about its new "home assistant" virtual reality headset and Wi-Fi router system. The San Francisco event marked a shift in strategy for Google, which is undertaking a major drive to make Google Assistant artificial intelligence a futuristic force spanning all kinds of internet-linked devices.

"Our goal is to build a personal Google for each and every user." Rick Osterloh, head of a new hardware division at the California-based internet giant, added, "We believe that the next big innovation is going to take place at the intersection of hardware and software, with AI at the center." Pixel will be available with a five- or 5.5-inch display, starting at $649 for US customers, similar to the latest iPhone models. Pre-orders began Tuesday in Australia, Canada, Germany, Britain and the United States. - Made by Google - By using its own name on handsets, Google is aiming for a bigger slice of the competitive smartphone market, dominated by Samsung and Apple. Until now, Google's flagship devices had used the Nexus brand with hardware partners that have included China's Huawei and South Korea's LG. The California group also sought to expand in the smartphone market by purchasing Motorola in 2011, but sold the unit less than three years later. Unlike past smartphone alliances, Google stressed that it had complete control of Pixel from start to finish, contracting with Taiwan-based HTC to manufacture handsets. "Google today demonstrated that it's finally serious about hardware," said Jan Dawson at Jackdaw Research. "The Pixel phones are clearly being positioned as peers to the iPhone." The new Pixel phone is "the first phone made by Google inside and out," said Sabrina Ellis of the Pixel product management team. By producing both the hardware and Android software, Google is making a more direct assault on Apple and its tightly controlled ecosystem. Besides being the first smartphone to ship with Google Assistant, it will come with unlimited storage for photos and videos and be compatible with the company's new Daydream virtual reality platform. Pixel has a "smart" camera for sublime photos, and a program to make it easy for users to switch operating systems, a move aimed at encouraging iPhone users to convert to Android. However, Google may find it challenging to gain market share, analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy said. "Aside from the camera, the new Google Pixels are pretty undifferentiated compared to Samsung and iPhone 7th generation phones," he said. "They don't exactly swing anyone around the room." - Apple's world - Gartner analyst Brian Blau said "the most exciting part" of Tuesday's announcement was the assistant, which showcases Google's strength in artificial intelligence. "It's a different tactic from Google, taking the stance that they want to have that direct relationship with their customers," he said. "It is clearly a step into Apple's world" of controlling hardware and software and services, he added. Pixel will be sold through US carrier Verizon and telecom groups, and be available at Google's online shop unlocked. Google also showed off a new Daydream View headset into which compatible smartphones can be slipped to serve as screens for virtual reality experiences. View headsets are made of soft cloth, purportedly inspired by casual clothes. Daydream View bundled with a controller device will be available in November, priced at $79. Google added to the coming hardware line-up with a modular Wi-Fi system that lets a set of interconnected mini-modems be spread around homes to make signals strong in all spots. "Unlike a single, central router, multiple Google Wi-Fi points do a better job of delivering connectivity to all parts of the home," Google executive Mario Queiroz said. The internet giant also introduced its Google Home virtual assistant, which will be a direct challenge to popular Amazon Echo devices. Google described Home as a voice-activated assistant that enables users to tap into the company's online capabilities to answer questions, manage tasks, control devices in homes, stream videos and more. "Much like Amazon Echo, Google Home is less a story about a wireless speaker and more about a point of access to a virtual assistant," IHS Markit senior analyst Paul Erickson said. "Ultimately, it will be the virtual assistants that are the trump card, and Google Assistant is expected to only grow in superiority to Alexa when it comes to personalization and everyday usefulness for mainstream users," he added of Amazon Echo's voice-activated program. Google Home was also synced to work with the freshly unveiled Chromecast Ultra device for streaming high-resolution online video to television screens. The $129 Google Home device will be available in retail shops on November 4.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums EVE: Gunjack 2 blasts away on Google Daydream VR by Wayne Manion  4:28 PM on October 4, 2016 CCP Games has released the first trailer for EVE: Gunjack 2 - End of Shift, the sequel to its 2015 VR shooter EVE: Gunjack. The first game in the series worked with the HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, and Samsung Gear VR, but the sequel will be released exclusively for Google's newly announced Daydream VR. As of now, the Google Pixel is the only smartphone compatible with Google's new VR platform. Check out the video below. End of Shift begins with the player stationed on Kubera, a heavy duty mining platform in the Outer Ring of the New Eden system in the EVE universe. The player operates a gun turret, protecting the other residents of Kubera from swarms of attackers. The game plays out as a fast-paced on-rails shooter with a first-person perspective, à la Star Fox and the Panzer Dragoon series of days gone by. CCP Games says EVE: Gunjack 2 - End of Shift should start blasting in November 2016.

 Google still isn't a hardware company, and it's not even playing on the same field as Apple Matt Rosoff Oct. 4, 2016, 7:04 PM 45,028 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google hardware chief Rick Osterloh. Google Google held a splashy press event in San Francisco on Tuesday to unveil a bunch of new hardware, including a designed-from-scratch phone called the Pixel, a fabric-covered virtual reality headset called Daydream View, an Amazon Echo competitor called Google Home, and a home Wi-Fi system known as Google Wifi. Unlike Google's past dalliances in hardware, this time all the products are under one division, led by Rick Osterloh, the former Motorola president, and they seem more coherently tied together than ever before. For instance, Google's virtual agent, the Google Assistant, shows up in both the Wi-Fi-connected Home speaker and the new Pixel phone (though you activate it slightly differently — with Home, you have to say "OK Google" every time, while the Pixel simply lets you press and hold the home software button). The Pixel and the larger Pixel XL are the first (and so far only) phones designed to work with the Daydream headset. You can get a Daydream View and a base for the Home in the same off-white color called "snow." The products themselves also seemed solid when I tried them in Google's demo area, though we haven't had a chance to review them independently. The Home smart speaker really did respond correctly when asked to "play that Smashmouth song from Shrek," or to turn down a Nest thermostat — I was particularly impressed at how well it picked up our voice commands in a crowded and noisy space. The Pixel looks as good as any other high-end smartphone. The Daydream View may make you look like a dork (like all VR viewers), but it's got some smart design touches, like the little cubby where you tuck the remote control, and it comes in some cool colors and is covered with a pleasant soft fabric. The Daydream View and remote. Google All that aside, I still think Google's heart is elsewhere. Why? Following, not leading. All the new products are like something else that already exists. The Pixel is like Apple's iPhone. The Home is like Amazon's Echo. The Daydream View is a cheap VR starter kit, far less sophisticated (and far cheaper) than Facebook's Oculus or Sony's PlayStation VR. The Wi-Fi is like a product from Eero or any number of other startups — and in fact, companies have been promising to simplify Wi-Fi for more than a decade. (I have a five-year-old Cisco Valet that promised simpler home Wi-Fi, and it still isn't very good, and I remember Microsoft's short-lived home Wi-Fi routers in 2004 or so, which promised the same thing.) Google isn't manufacturing the phone. Google designed it, and it has some custom Google silicon in it, but the actual manufacturing is being handled by HTC — a phone maker. We've seen this movie before. If Google is really serious about getting into the hardware business in a big way, why did it spend over $12 billion to buy a major phone maker, Motorola, in 2011 only to jettison that business to Lenovo less than three years later? As Larry Page said when he sold Motorola, "It helps to be all-in when it comes to making mobile devices." Do we think Page has changed his mind? No retail play. Where will people be able to test and buy these things? When Microsoft got into hardware, it opened a big set of retail stores. Amazon plans to set up as many 100 retail pop-up kiosks in malls, as Business Insider previously reported. Google's retail strategy? Online and partners: You'll buy these things at Walmart and Best Buy, alongside dozens of other products from every consumer-electronics company in the sun. As far as support goes, online chat will attempt to take the place of the Apple Genius Bar. Financials. Google doesn't break out its hardware sales on its financials. If it starts doing so, that would be a sign it's serious about this business. Perhaps most telling, when Google CEO Sundar Pichai was talking on Tuesday, he didn't show the kind of excitement and energy he shows at Google I/O, the company's annual event for developers. Pichai is a software developer; those are his people. He was most animated during a long diversion about Google's machine-learning prowess in translating English to Chinese — a tough problem, but one for software engineering, not hardware. Sundar Pichai at the Google hardware event. Matt Rosoff/Business Insider Osterloh, Google's hardware boss, took pains to reassure the world on Tuesday that the company was serious about hardware this time and was in it for the long haul. But in fact, the best part of these Google hardware products isn't the hardware. It's the software and services that underpin them — the brains behind the Google Assistant, the unlimited photo storage for the Pixel provided by Google's cloud, the Daydream virtual reality platform that third parties will be able to use to create 3D content. So this is not Google turning into Apple. It's more akin to Google following Microsoft when it started doing hardware in 2010 to help show what Windows 8 was capable of on touch-screen devices. Microsoft does take hardware seriously. It has some excellent designers. It's making some very strong products and forcing Apple to respond. But it's hardware in service of Microsoft's other products and its broader strategy of productivity everywhere, not hardware for its own sake. That's the template Google is following. Google's broader strategy is providing access to all the world's information and selling advertisements against the attention consumers pay to get that information. Consumers or investors who think otherwise risk confusion and disappointment.

About Future Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / WiFi Calling Innovator Republic Wireless to Immediately Support Pixel and Pixel XL Smartphones Made by Google WiFi Calling Innovator Republic Wireless to Immediately Support Pixel and Pixel XL Smartphones Made by Google Posted on October 4, 2016 by Benzinga Full Feed in Press Releases Conceptual image of a businessman holding big hammer More savings with WiFi calling and more phone choices – As part of its new ‘Bring Your Own Phone’ strategy, Republic Wireless to support same day activations of new Android smartphones. Raleigh, NC (PRWEB) October 04, 2016 WiFi calling innovator Republic Wireless today demonstrated how rapidly it can now support new Android smartphones on its network. As part of its recently launched ‘Bring Your Own Phone’ (BYOP) program, Republic Wireless will allow customers who buy the Google Pixel or the Pixel XL smartphones to activate the phones on its network the first day the phones are available, late this October. Available in three colors (Quite Silver, Really Blue, and Very Black), two storage options (32GB and 128GB), and starting at $649 for an unlocked version, Google’s new phones are loaded with the latest tech like Google Assistant, Daydream Virtual Reality, and unlimited storage for photos. Google is currently taking pre-orders for the new Pixel smartphones on its website. Both the Google Pixel and Pixel XL, will ship with the latest version of the Android operating system Nougat. While waiting for the phone, customers can order a Republic Wireless SIM card at http://www.RepublicWireless.com for just $5. “Pop the Republic Wireless SIM into the Google Pixel or Pixel XL and customers can begin recognizing immediate savings with plans that start as low as $15 a month,” said Chris Chuang, Chief Operating Officer of Republic Wireless. “It’s a very exciting development. We worked hard to move our hybrid WiFi/cellular calling and Adaptive Coverage™ technology out of the phone’s ROM and into the cloud, which opens up our network to a wide selection of Android smartphones. Where it used to take months to certify new phones for our network and restricted our phone selection to one manufacturer, we can now support the latest Android devices from all manufacturers on the same day as the Big 4 carriers.” Bring Your Own Phone quickly follows on the heels of other exciting news for Republic Wireless. Widely recognized as the industry’s leading WiFi-first innovator, Republic has steadily raised the bar for WiFi calling quality and offers the industry’s most robust seamless handover with new technology such as ‘Adaptive Coverage™’ enabled with Bonded Calling™, which catches dropped calls before they even happen. “From the beginning, our hallmark has been to use engineering innovation to unlock value for customers. That began with WiFi calling and Adaptive Coverage, and today extends to giving our customers access to the latest Android phones on the first day they are available,” Chuang adds.                                                                                          # # # About Republic Wireless Recognized for excellence in customer service by PC Magazine and as the top pre-paid carrier choice by Consumer Reports, Republic Wireless is on a mission to use technology in smarter ways to save you money. A division of Bandwidth, headquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina, Republic Wireless leverages the power of both WiFi and cellular networks and gives consumers the ultimate flexibility to manage costs. The service uses WiFi in the home, office or anywhere else as the primary network for calls, texts and data. When outside of WiFi coverage, the smartphone works just like a typical smartphone on the cellular networks of national CDMA carriers. Visit http://www.republicwireless.com/ for more information.

Google Unveils 'Pixel' Smartphone VOA News Facebook 0 Twitter 0 E-mail More Google+ LinkedIn KakaoStory October 05, 2016 08:03 Google is taking another leap into the $400 billion smartphone market. While the company's software, Android, runs millions of phones worldwide, Google unveiled a line of smartphones called Pixel at an event Tuesday. The phone is expected to sell for $649, about the same as Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy. Pixel will come in two sizes, 12.7 centimeters and 14 centimeters, and three colors, black, silver and blue. In addition to a premium camera and long battery life, the company is expected to use Pixel to highlight a digital assistant software called "Google Assistant." Sabrina Ellis, Google director of product management, talks about the new Google Pixel phone during a product event in San Francisco, California on Oct. 4, 2016. /AP The software uses artificial intelligence that would create a "personal Google for each and every user," according to Sundar Pichai, Google's CEO. Pixel is built by HTC, but Google has reportedly been in on the design, leading to the "phone by Google" branding. The phones are powered by a Snapdragon 821 processor. Google also said it would offer free unlimited cloud storage for all, full-resolution images and videos shot with Pixel. Pixel will not be Google's first move into the smartphone market. In the past, the company sold phones and tablets under the Nexus brand. The company did not heavily market the phones, which limited their popularity. Pixel will be powered by Google's Android operating system, which powers most of the world's smartphones At Tuesday's event, the company said the phones will run on a cleaner version of Android than on other phones like the Samsung Galaxy S7. Google said the Pixel version would be faster. The Bloomberg news service called Google's move into the smartphone market "risky" but said it likely is spurred by the company's desire to "ensure distribution for its web services, and more complex offerings like virtual and augmented reality." Google has not said how much it has spent on Pixel. Copyright © Chosunilbo & Chosun.com Previous Next All Headlines Back to Top

The phones were complemented by an array of new and updated products—including a voice-activated home assistant, a pair of VR goggles, and a souped-up video streaming dongle—that push Google’s AI into every corner of users’ lives, but only for the benefit of you, the flesh-lumps. The glorious flesh-lumps. “Just like we built a Google for everyone,” Google CEO Sunday Pichai said as he opened the presentation, “we want to build each user his or her own individual Google.” In other words, a Google for everyone. This new vision of Google is fueled by an AI system that Pichai claimed is better than ever. For instance, six months ago, the Google AI’s image-interpretation “quality” was 89.6 percent, according to Pichai, and now it is 93.9 percent. “Okay, but 93.9 percent of what?” you might wonder. Google finds your curiosity charming. You are truly a special skin-corpse. The groundbreaking 4.3 percent increase is one of the advances that fuel the company’s individualized AI, which tracks personal information (gathered from sources like your email, text messages, and direct input) to anticipate your needs and act as your eager helper—hence its warm and inviting name, Google Assistant. A new line of phones, deemed Pixel, comes with Google Assistant built in, and executive Brian Rakowski took the stage to demonstrate some of the tricks it can do. “Show me my photos from last October,” Rakowski asked—because that’s a perfectly natural thing that actual human people would request—and the telephone did so. It’s a rule of Silicon Valley keynotes: Every new advancement is just another way to look at your photos. But the benefits for blood-bags like yourself go beyond a software robot that reads all your text messages. For instance, the Pixel also comes with free unlimited cloud storage for the pictures and 4K videos you can shoot with the built-in camera (which Google claims is the best smartphone camera ever thanks to a high grade from the photography testing site DxOMark). By comparison, Apple only offers its users a stingy 5 gigabytes of iCloud storage for free, as Apple is still waiting to see if this whole internet thing pans out. Preorders opened today (for November delivery) on a website that charismatically invites users to “Meet Pixel, Phone by Google.” The 5-inch version of the Pixel starts at $650 while the 5.5-inch Pixel XL starts at $770—not coincidentally equivalent to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus pricing tiers. Those prices are for the base models with 32 gigabytes of storage; upgrading to 128 gigs will run you an extra $100. Verizon is the exclusive U.S. carrier to sell the Pixel, but you can buy carrier-agnostic unlocked phones direct from Google. The phones come in “Quite Black,” “Very Silver,” and “Really Blue” varieties, because Google is 93.9 percent sure that’s how human people talk about color. Among the other product announcement at the Google event today were Google Wifi, a router that aims to simplify the process of setting up a wireless network—the stated goal of every wi-fi router released since 2007. There’s also Google Home, a voice-activated home assistant that could not be a more thorough ripoff of Amazon’s widely praised Echo if it tried. The Home boasts deep integration with home automation technologies, which is a boon to “smart home” users but is of little relevance to the rest of us luddites, who have never experienced the thrill of reapplying a failed firmware update to a light bulb. The Home can also work hand-in-hand with a more powerful version of Google’s popular and well-received Chromecast streaming dongle, the Chromecast Ultra. The Ultra supports 4K and HDR, because those are the fashionable acronyms to support these days, but at $70 it’s twice the price of its less capable sibling. And the company announced a VR headset, because that whole “put a computer on your face” thing worked out so great for Google the first time.

I got a chance to go hands-on with the device and came impressed with the wearable. Clay Bavor, vice president of virtual reality at Google, made a point during the company’s keynote to highlight the fact that he and his team looked to clothing, not other currently available VR headsets, when they sat down to design the View. It’s an approach that makes a lot of sense; after all, a VR headset, more so than something like a fitness tracker, is the most wearable piece of technology a person can wear. In any case, the View feels great to hold in the hand and it is comfortable to wear. Moreover, it helps that the View is light as well. During his presentation, Bavor said Google’s new headset is 30 percent lighter the competition. Granted, I only had about five minutes with the device, but it felt like most people could pull off lengthy 30 to 40 minute sessions without feeling exhausted at the end. One issue is that the only way to adjust the focus of the View’s lenses is to reposition the unit. I managed to find a decent alignment at first, but after tilting my head one too many times, the image was no longer in focus. The actual virtual reality experience is about what you expect. Without a high-powered desktop GPU there to power the experience, fidelity is on the low side. The first experience had me sitting in a museum while the fossil of an aquatic dinosaur came to life. The Vive has a similar experience that is a lot more engaging. Still, the Pixel does a decent job. I should note I have yet to put on and use a VR headset without getting a headache afterward. The Google spokesperson guiding me through the demo told the company has managed to get response latency to the point where it should be imperceptible to almost everyone, which in turn should stop the majority of people from feeling sick while using the headset. Alas, I still got a headache after using the View. That says less about the View and more about my brain and the way it reacts to these devices, but do keep in mind if you’ve felt ill after using a VR headset in the past, this might not be the device to solve that issue. Bavor also made a point to highlight how easy it is to use the View, and the headset lived up to that claim. Whether the user pops in a Pixel or Pixel XL, there’s no special process to go through to get either device working the View. The headset will automatically recognize the device and adjust as needed. Presumably, the View will also be able to recognize and configure itself to work with future Daydream-ready Android devices when they come out on the market. The controller also deserves special mention. Google has designed it in such a way where all the buttons have their own unique feel, which helps make it extremely easy to navigate with touch only. We still have to wait and see whether this is the headset brings virtual reality to the masses, but for the time being Daydream View looks promising. When it launches in Canada later this year, Daydream View will cost $100. Initially, only the ‘Slate’ colour will be available to purchase. The headset will be sold on the Google Store, as well as through Rogers, Fido, Telus, Bell and Best Buy.

However the Daydream VR software will not. The Nexus 6p does have Daydream development support. However the SD 810 has thermal issues. Plus it’s sensors (gyroscope and accelerometer) are not as fast or as accurate as the new Pixel devices. Therefore the Nexus 6p will not be officially upgraded to a Daydream compatible device. If you really want to play with Daydream and have a Nexus 6p, then you can manually install the software yourself.

October 4, 2016 2:49 PM PDT James Martin/CNET At an event this morning, Google announced a slew of new products, including the debut of the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones. The phones have the same design, same processor, same storage and same camera. So with all this sameness, what are the differences? Well, there are not many. And that's good, because even if you get the smaller one, you're not missing out on any cool features. The real differences are in battery and screen size, as well as the resolution and price. Screen size: Despite the Pixel XL having a larger screen with more resolution, the smaller Pixel still sports a very respectable 1,920x1,080-pixel display. Battery: The Pixel has a 2,770mAh battery and the Pixel XL a 3,450mAh battery. Until we test the phones, we can't be certain how much more battery life, if any, the Pixel XL will get. Price: For a 32 GB model, the Pixel starts at $649 and the Pixel XL at $769. Both are available for preorder today -- except the blue version, which is sold out. The Pixel and Pixel XL come built-in with Google Assistant and support for Google's Daydream VR platform. Google touts that the camera on the Pixel series is better than on any other smartphone. DxOMark, a camera-testing website, gives the Pixel's camera a score of 89 -- the highest for any smartphone.

The Google Assistant, formally released this week amid a slew of hardware offerings, is central to Google CEO Sundar Pichai's effort to align the company with what he sees as an epochal shift from mobile-centric to AI-centric computing. The Assistant is a voice-activated digital assistant similar to Microsoft's Cortana, Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri. It is an evolution of the existing Google Now technology and is the result of the considerable time and money the company has spent on machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies in recent years. The Assistant is designed to let users interact with Google using conversational speech in the home and outside it, with and without their smartphones and tablets. Unlike Google Now, which is present only on Android and iOS devices, the Assistant will be integrated into the company's smartphones, tablets, Google Home digital assistant device, messaging apps and other future hardware products. Google touts the Assistant as technology that is capable of understanding the meaning and the context of the queries and the instructions of those interacting with it, and is capable of responding in an intelligent and actionable manner. In addition to smarter web searches, the technology allows users to do things like controlling home entertainment and lighting systems, making reservations, navigating or pulling up information on local weather and news using voice commands. "The last 10 years have been about building a world that is mobile-first, turning our phones into remote controls for our lives," Pichai said in announcing the new products today. "But in the next 10 years, we will shift to a world that is AI-first, a world where computing becomes universally available—be it at home, at work, in the car or on the go." The Google Assistant, according to Pichai, will be a central component of the company's effort to move users to a more natural, intuitive and intelligent way of interacting with computing devices. The integration of the Assistant with Allo, Google's newly released messaging app, was just the beginning, Pichai said. The company has already built the Assistant into its new Pixel phones announced today and with the Google Home voice-activated digital assistant. Over the next few years, Google will work on integrating the technology in all of the different places, contexts and situations that people interact with computers. "And that means building the Google Assistant and other amazing software into the hardware that you depend on every day," Pichai said. Virtual assistants such as the Google Assistant, Apple Siri, Microsoft Cortana and Amazon Alexa represent a desire by users and technology vendors to evolve from personal to fully personalized computing, said Charles King, principal analyst at Pund-IT. "Of the four, I believe that Google and Apple are best positioned to succeed, mainly due to their strengths in mobile platforms, devices and services where a lot of related battles will take place," King said. Google is better positioned to work with open technologies and communities than Apple, a point that should work to the company's benefit in the shift to more personalized computing models, he said. "This isn't to say that Google is a guaranteed winner, but I believe it's fair to say that it's the company most other players have to beat."           LATEST ENTERPRISE APPS ARTICLES   Microsoft's AI Efforts Get a Boost from Nvidia, Elon Musk's OpenAI CA Technologies Unveils New DevOps, SaaS, Mainframe Tools Microsoft Takes Platinum Membership in Linux Foundation GE Unveils a Ton of new Predix Products for Industrial IoT Windows 10 Sticky Notes Grow More Insightful in More Languages                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

He's probably right. Artificial intelligence is all the rage in Silicon Valley these days, as technology companies race to build the first killer app that utilizes machine learning and image recognition. Today, Google announced an AI-powered assistant built into its new Pixel phones. But there's a pivotal downside to the company's latest creation: Because of the very nature of artificial intelligence, our data is less secure than ever before, and technology companies are now collecting even more personal information about each one of us. Google's new assistant, which debuted in the company's new messaging app Allo, works like this: Simply ask the assistant a question about the weather, nearby restaurants, or for directions, and it responds with detailed information right there in the chat interface. It is undoubtedly neat and useful. Pichai stressed at today's Google event that this is just the beginning for artificial intelligence. Google's artificial intelligence will only become smarter, faster, and more accurate. It will learn things about your habits and preferences to better serve you personalized results and to answer more specific questions. But this is where the problems start. Because Google's assistant recommends things that are innately personal to you, like where to eat tonight or how to get from point A to B, it is amassing a huge collection of your most personal thoughts, visited places, and preferences. Google is pretty vague about what exactly the assistant is collecting. It can access information on your devices like contacts or storage (read: literally anything stored to your device), and it can also access "content on your screen." In order for the AI to "learn" this means it will have to collect and analyze as much data about you as possible in order to serve you more accurate recommendations, suggestions, and data. In order for artificial intelligence to function, your messages have to be unencrypted. Computer scientists are trying to figure out a way to make "searchable encryption," but that's a ways off. Besides, even standard encryption still has problems. Google offers state-of-the art encryption within its Allo messaging app, but if you turn it on, say goodbye to your fancy AI assistant. That means Google's stuck between a rock and a hard place here. The security engineers at Google know, and cryptography experts agree, that automatic encryption is the best way to defend personal data and conversations from hackers and government surveillance. But in order to stay competitive against all the other technology companies that have (or will eventually have) AI-powered assistants, Google has no choice. Kudos to Google for offering users the choice of encrypting their messages, but I wished we lived in a world where people could use Google's cool new feature while keeping their messages secure at the same time. Googles isn't alone in this push-and-pull. In fact, Facebook has pretty much the exact same problem. Facebook Messenger also has opt-in encryption, and uses what is widely regarded as the gold standard for encrypting messages, just like Google does. But in order for users to do things like call an Uber from the app or use a fun bot, their messages have to be unencrypted. These new assistants are really cool, and the reality is that tons of people will probably use them and enjoy the experience. But at the end of the day, we're sacrificing the security and privacy of our data so that Google can develop what will eventually become a new revenue stream. Lest we forget: Google and Facebook have a responsibility to investors, and an assistant that offers up a sponsored result when you ask it what to grab for dinner tonight could be a huge moneymaker. Google is betting that people care more about convenience and ease than they do about a seemingly oblique notion of privacy, and it is increasingly correct in that assumption. Google's job is to innovate and make money, and if nothing else, be glad the company is offering you a robust option to protect your data. But, you know, an option that means sacrificing some very helpful AI-powered assistance.

Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Oct 4, 2016 at 6:28PM Apple puts a lot of emphasis on the iPhone's camera. Image source: Apple. One of the more notable announcements from Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) event to show off the new Google Pixel was the claim that the new phone has the best smartphone camera ever made. Google attributes this feat to a DxOMark Mobile score of 89. DxOMark is a third-party entity that rates and scores cameras and lenses for both high-end DSLRs and smartphones using industrial labs and analysis software. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) cares deeply about the iPhone's camera performance. At every unveiling event, discussion of new cameras inevitably dominates a large chunk of the presentation. The Mac maker's camera team has ballooned to 800 engineers that work on over 200 distinct components within the camera modules. The camera is one of the areas where Apple allocates tremendous resources in annual improvements, and this year the headliner is the new dual-camera system found in the iPhone 7 Plus. The Pixel's camera chops are a direct shot across Apple's bow. Shots fired For those that are so inclined, here are the full DxOMark reviews for the Pixel and the iPhone 7 (note that DxOMark has not had a chance to review the iPhone 7 Plus quite yet). It's also worth acknowledging that the Pixel is not the only phone camera to score higher than Apple; Sony, Motorola, Samsung, and HTC all have phones that squeezed ahead in the ratings. If we break down the scores into the different categories, you can see precisely where the Pixel outperforms the iPhone 7.   Pixel iPhone 7 Category Photo Video Photo Video Exposure and contrast 90 88 90 85 Color 85 86 84 85 Autofocus 93 90 89 88 Texture 93 84 83 83 Noise 89 89 84 79 Artifacts 84 88 96 84 Flash 88 -- 81 -- Stabilization -- 91 -- 86 Overall 89 88 86 85 Data source: DxOMark. The Pixel does modestly better in areas like autofocus and texture, but dramatically outscores the iPhone 7 for things like noise and stabilization (for videos). That's even after the iPhone 7's own massive improvement in video stabilization, since Apple added optical image stabilization (OIS) to the 4.7-inch model this year; OIS was only available on the 5.5-inch 6 Plus last year. Last year's iPhone 6S scored just 60 in video stabilization. The real kicker Google has another ace up its sleeve, though. For Pixel owners, Google Photos will now offer unlimited cloud storage at full 4K resolutions, even for 4K videos. That's an extremely generous and aggressive offer as the search giant hopes to woo shutterbugs. Google Photos already offers unlimited cloud storage for downscaled photos, which is likely sufficient for average consumers, so this is very much targeting the pros. Importantly, this is an area where Apple is unlikely to follow. Apple has decided to use iCloud photo storage as a way to upsell iCloud storage tiers. iCloud Storage Monthly Price 50 GB $0.99 200 GB $2.99 1 TB $9.99 2 TB $19.99 Data source: Apple. A photo professional's photo library of original quality files will undoubtedly be over 50 GB, so they can safely disregard the first paid tier. Apple's play here is to increase its services revenue, which is part of its broader effort to focus investors on recurring revenue sources instead of quarterly unit sales, even if that means letting Google keep an important point of differentiation.

Resend activation e-mail Gear & Gadgets / Product News & Reviews Pixel is the future at Google: company says it has “No plans” for Nexus phones The Nexus brand is going away, and for now Google is doing "Pixel" or nothing. by Ron Amadeo - Oct 4, 2016 10:42 pm UTC Login to bookmark 129 Left: The $379 Nexus 5X, Right: The $649 Pixel. SAN FRANCISCO—Google just announced the new "Pixel" line, a super-premium set of smartphones costing $650 and up. Google users accustomed to $380 or $500 Nexus devices will find this announcement a tough pill to swallow, which begs the question: is the Nexus line dead? For now, to the extent that Google has any serious future roadmap, the Nexus line seems dead. Google's official statement is that there are "No plans" for future Nexus devices. Existing Nexus devices are also getting downplayed by Google when it comes to having the latest version of Android. The Pixel phones are getting Android 7.1 out of the gate, while Nexus devices will have to deal with a "developer preview" testing period. For most companies this would be an unsurprising move, but different teams inside Google sometimes bring competing products to market. With the advent of the Google Hardware division, the company appears to be sticking to a unified branding strategy. That doesn't necessarily mean the value-for-money segment is dead. If Google really is an OEM now, OEMs have a range of products at different price points. So maybe the Google Hardware team will work on releasing a smartphone that isn't an ultra-premium, $650-$770 device. For now, Google is arguing that "bang-for-your-buck" devices like the $400 OnePlus 3 and various phones from Xiaomi and Huawei still exist, and Android customers are free to buy them.

Nov 2016, 15:14 MEZ - Deutsche Märkte schließen in 2 Stunden 16 Minuten Google is going to win the next major battle in computingVon Steve Kovach | Business Insider – Di., 4. Okt 2016 23:46 MESZ Freigeben 0 Twittern 0 Share0 Drucken Firmen: Alphabet Inc. AKTUELLER KURS Symbol Kurs Veränderung GOOG 771,23 (Google CEO Sundar Pichai at Tuesday's event.AP) Over four years ago, Google launched a bold evolution of search called Google Now. Google Now wasn’t the search you were used to. Instead of a list of results to your queries, you got the single answer you were looking for. How old is Barack Obama? What time is the Super Bowl? When was the last time the Mets won the World Series? You always got the answer. And even better, Google Now was proactive, bringing you the information you wanted before you even knew you wanted it. Your flight is delayed. Traffic is bad, so you’d better leave a few minutes early if you want to make it to work on time. Your favorite team lost again. Google Now felt like the future at a time when Apple was still trying to get Siri to understand you when you asked it 2+2. On Tuesday, Google kicked it into high gear. At its big product launch event, Google Now officially became super-charged with Google Assistant, the next evolution of its AI. We got an early look at Assistant in Allo, Google’s new messaging app that launched a few weeks ago, but Tuesday’s event showed us Google’s true vision for its new AI helper. Assistant will be everywhere, helping you out no matter what gadget or app you’re using. And according to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, it’ll keep getting smarter the more you use it, to the point that it’ll be so customized to the user that there will be a unique Google Assistant for everyone. It may not be a new idea — all the major tech companies from Microsoft to Amazon to Facebook have their own AI assistants — but it is a category Google is uniquely qualified to dominate. (Google Assistant in the Allo chat app.Skye Gould/Business Insider) After all these years, Google continues to embarrass the competition. While Assistant can tap into the world’s knowledge, Siri struggles to answer even the simplest queries. I recently asked both AIs when Tuesday’s vice presidential debates start. Google Assistant told me 9 p.m. Eastern. Siri gave me a list of search results about the election from Bing. That’s just one example, but if you use Google Assistant often enough, you realize just how far ahead it is. Then there’s the new Google Home speaker, a competitor to Amazon’s surprise hit Echo speaker. While the Echo is a great device, Google’s demo of Home already felt ahead of what Amazon has pulled off so far. Of course, it can play music and control smart appliances. But it also intelligently answers questions better than Amazon’s Alexa. And overall, Echo can’t do half of the things we saw Home do on Tuesday. Google has literally built a multibillion dollar business on its ability to answer questions. (Pichai said Tuesday Google’s Knowledge Graph is loaded with a growing library of 70 billion facts.) Now it’s focusing that expertise on AI that will be with you no matter where you are. Your home. Your car. Your phone. And soon, everywhere else. The AI assistant race is the next major battle in personal computing, and Assistant is the first step towards that ever-present, voice-controlled computer. It already wipes the floor with the competition, and it’s tough to see how anyone else can keep up.

Blue | Bloomberg | Getty Images Attendees working on Apple Inc. laptop computers participate in the Yahoo! Inc. Mobile Developer Conference Hackathon in New York, U.S., on Tuesday, Aug. 25, 2015. Microsoft and Google want to make it clear that their email services, Outlook, Hotmail and Gmail, are safe from U.S. government spies. The two companies issued the following statements to CNBC, following a Reuters report revealing that Internet giant Yahoo secretly scanned customer emails for U.S. intelligence officials, according to reporter Joseph Menn's sources. "We have never engaged in the secret scanning of email traffic like what has been reported today about Yahoo." — a Microsoft spokesperson said in an emailed response to CNBC. A spokesperson from Alphabet's Google's issued this statement to CNBC: "We've never received such a request, but if we did, our response would be simple: 'no way'." According to Reuters, citing two former employees and a third person with knowledge of the events, Yahoo scanned hundreds of millions of email accounts at the bidding of the National Security Agency or FBI, in order to comply with a classified U.S. government directive. The company also reportedly built a software custom tool to monitor all of its users incoming emails for certain information specified by U.S. intelligence agents, according to Reuters sources. Yahoo, which is in the middle of a sale to Verizon, has said it did nothing wrong — the company issued this statement to CNBC: "Yahoo is a law abiding company, and complies with the laws of the United States." Verizon declined to comment to CNBC. The American Civil Liberties Union called the order the U.S. government reportedly issued Yahoo "unprecedented and unconstitutional," and said it was disappointed with Yahoo's compliance. The conference is sponsored by CNBC, MIT and The Aspen Institute.

Local Real Estate Subscribe Now GOOGLE has announced a high end phone with a 12.3 megapixel camera to take on Apple's iPhone 7 and Samsung's Galaxy S7. Google Pixel, the upmarket update on its Nexus phone, promises the best Android experience on the market with better integration of software and hardware. "With Pixel, we obsessed over every detail, from the industrial design to the user experience,'' Google said in a blog spruiking the new $1079 phone which will be available in Australia. "We carefully sculpted the surfaces of the phone, and rounded the edges to make it easy to grip. "We used 2.5D Corning Gorilla Glass 4 on the front display and back glass to accent the aerospace grade aluminum body. Google's new high end smartphone Pixel will be priced from $1079 in Australia. "The glass on the back also features Pixel Imprint, our fingerprint sensor, which is placed on the back of the phone where your finger expects it. You can even swipe it to access your notifications. "And no matter what you're using your phone for, you'll need a battery that lasts all day and charges fast - up to seven hours in 15 minutes." Google says Pixel is the first phone with Google Assistant built in. You simply say "Ok Google" or touch and hold the Home button and your assistant is ready to help. You can ask it for a brief update on your day or to play a video on YouTube. You can look up traffic on the way home from work or when the nearest pharmacy closes. "You can even say "show me my camping photos with Andrew" and it'll instantly display the photos you're looking for,'' the blog said. Camera features bigger aperture Google say the Pixel camera is "the best smartphone camera we've ever made''. "(Camera testing site) DxOMark Mobile gave the phone the highest rating they've ever given to a smartphone camera. "Our DxOMark Mobile score of 89 is a great example of what's possible when great hardware meets great software. "Pixel has a 12.3MP camera, featuring an f/2.0 aperture and big 1.55 micron pixels to capture lots and lots of light. "Our team of photography gurus and image processing experts have spent the last year designing and tirelessly optimizing our entire camera stack. "Pixel's camera lets you take stunning photos in low light, bright light or any light. "Catch action shots as they happen with Smartburst, which takes a rapid-fire sequence of shots and automatically selects the best one. The camera also promises to rival the unreleased feature of the iPhone 7 Plus. "Use Lens Blur to achieve shallow depth of field and bokeh effects, making your subject pop. You can capture dramatic landscapes or make faces glow with new exposure controls. One of the big selling points of the phone is free unlimited online storage for original quality photos and videos taken on your Pixel at full resolution in Google Photos. Pixel ships with the newest Android operating system, 7.1 Nougat. Phones will get software and security updates as soon as they're available, directly from Google. "We've also made the update process easier. When a new update is available, it can download and install in the background - no more waiting around for your phone to update." The Pixel also comes with Google Duo and Allo pre-installed so you can video call and text with your friends, whether they're on Android or iOS. Pixel comes in two sizes, 5" or 5.5", and two colours: Very Silver and Quite Black. Pixel is available for pre-order today in Australia starting at $1,079 RRP. Pixel will be available nationwide at all Telstra stores and JB Hi-Fi stores as well as through the Google Store.

Rick Osterloh, head of Google’s new hardware group, said that in doing so, Google can take full advantage of capabilities it’s designing with artificial intelligence and machine learning. Apple has long designed both iPhone hardware and the iOS operating-system software that runs on it. Now, Google is doing the same with the upcoming Pixel phones running Google’s Android system. The Pixel is one of several gadgets Google announced Tuesday in San Francisco. NEW PHONE, NEW BRANDING, NEW MARKETING Google’s previous phones, dubbed Nexus, had limited distribution. Now, the company is casting aside the Nexus name in favour of Pixel, a brand that Osterloh said has “always represented the best of hardware and software designed by Google.” And instead of relying primarily on online orders, as was the case with Nexus, Google will offer Pixel through Verizon as well, starting Oct. 20. Advance orders begin Tuesday starting at roughly $899 for the 5-inch version and $1,029 for the slightly larger 5.5-inch screen. One of the advantages Google phones have long had is their quick access to Android updates. With other phones, individual manufacturers and carriers have to approve changes, resulting in delays . Google said Verizon will still have to approve updates for Pixel, but the process will be streamlined and done ahead of time. Google promises a spectacular camera and unlimited online storage for phones at full resolution. When storage space on the phone is low, the Pixel will free up storage and rely on the online copy. Apple takes a similar approach with its iCloud Photo Library, though free storage is limited to 5 gigabytes, or a few thousand photos. IT’S IN YOUR HEAD Google’s new virtual-reality headset, Daydream View, will differ from other headsets, such as Samsung’s Gear VR, in having a companion motion controller and compatibility with a wide range of phones, including Pixel. Daydream is also a challenge to more sophisticated, but expensive systems from Facebook’s Oculus business, HTC and Sony — as well as to Google’s own Cardboard effort. Cardboard is cheap — available for as little as $20 — but it doesn’t offer much control over VR environments beyond pushing a button on the headset as you move your head. The new wireless motion controller for Daydream can function like a fishing rod, a steering wheel or a pointer to permit more sophisticated VR experiences. Daydream View and the controller will be out in November for US$79. You’ll need a new Android phone , as existing phones won’t have the right hardware. Google also plans to share design guidelines with other manufacturers to make Daydream headsets and controllers. AN ECHO OF AMAZON’S ECHO Google is promoting its new Home smart speaker as a way to access Google’s knowledge — hands free. Home will be able to perform many of the same tasks as Echo, Amazon’s internet-connected speaker. Both will use voice commands to play music, field questions and control home appliances — assuming you’ve installed “smart” versions of them. If you’re feeling creepy about a speaker listening to your conversations, Google says you can turn the microphone off. Home will be available on Nov. 4 for about US$130, with advance orders starting Tuesday. The cylinder-shaped Echo costs US$180, though Amazon also sells a smaller version shaped like a hockey puck that sells for US$50. WHAT ELSE? Google’s new video-streaming device, Chromecast Ultra, will support a higher-resolution video format called 4K. Larger, more expensive streaming devices such as the US$100 Amazon Fire TV already do that. Ultra will cost US$69. Meanwhile, Google wants to improve Wi-Fi in the home by creating its own router. The company said people use internet differently now, with games, video chatting and more on various devices throughout the home. The new Google Wifi system will cost about US$130 for the main device. A three-pack for larger homes will cost about US$300. BEYOND GOOGLE Even as it pushes Pixel, Google isn’t abandoning the Android system that other manufacturers can use for free. That means Samsung, LG and others can keep making their own phones with Google software. In that sense, Google’s approach is more like Microsoft’s than Apple’s. Microsoft also has been making hardware through its line of Surface computers running Windows. That puts Microsoft — and now Google — in the awkward position of promoting both its own devices and those of rivals that run the company’s software. BEYOND HARDWARE Google predicts that artificial intelligence will play a greater role in our lives. CEO Sundar Pichai said computing is transitioning to an AI -first world, just as it moved to a mobile-first world just a few years ago. “Our goal is to build a personal Google for each and every user,” Pichai said. “We want to build a Google for each user.” Google services along those lines include Google Assistant, software that’s designed to answer questions and retrieve information, conversation-style. Google Assistant made its debut in a chat app called Allo a few weeks ago. It will also be part of Home and the new Pixel phones. The features demonstrated Tuesday seem similar to what Amazon and Apple already offer with their virtual assistants. Google officials have repeatedly emphasized that its AI technology is in the early stages — so it remains to be seen what this new era for Google will lead to. Anick Jesdanun reported from New York.

Google’s Daydream VR platform plays it safe — and that’s okay Posted Oct 4, 2016 by Lucas Matney (@lucas_matney) 0 SHARES Next Story Due diligence is a responsibility for investors, an opportunity for startups Those hoping for Google to deliver more details of a quantum leap toward next-gen virtual reality may have been a bit disappointed Tuesday when the company chose to promote wide user accessibility above cutting-edge features in its VR headset. The Daydream View doesn’t have any buttons or embedded sensors; you just stick your phone in it and VR happens. Google is really targeting this device toward the average smartphone user and less so toward the inspired VR early adopter. In order to make this appeal, Google took everything that has worked on mobile VR: 360 video, 360 photos and games, and then it showed it off like it was all new again. There wasn’t an attempt from Google to ship its conception of a VR killer app; instead, it seems the company feels that promoting a Cardboard+ experience is enough to convince prospective Pixel patrons to pay $79 for the View. I had a chance to go hands-on with it after Google’s event today and it’s clear that the company is framing this as more of a successor to its Cardboard platform, rather than a total reinvention of it. The form factor is much more palatable, but the philosophy is the same: bring the masses simple VR. The first thing you notice about the headset is its comfort. Google went out of its way to prioritize a design that wasn’t too bulky, wasn’t too complicated and was soft to the touch. The fabric exterior seems quite breathable and was quite a bit more comfortable to use than Samsung’s updated Gear VR. The ergonomics are generally awesome, though I did notice some light sneaking in from the rigid edges of the View, causing some unfortunate glare on the lenses. Unlike the host of Cardboard headsets made for the platform, this one has a head strap, which was pretty simple to adjust. Overall it feels great. The next thing you’ll notice is that the Daydream experience isn’t nausea-inducing. Google seems to have really gotten VR mode in Android Nougat right for the compatible phones that support it. Sub-20ms latency is what keeps the image on the screen corresponding with your head movements. It’s a more noticeable difference than you might think, but it really allows you to engage with content for much longer than a couple of minutes. This is clearly the highlight of Daydream and it really is a marked upgrade. daydream-view daydream-view-controller daydream-view-logo daydream-view-2  View Slideshow Previous Next Exit A couple of the content pieces I got to try out integrated the View’s new Daydream controller. It’s pretty cool, though if you’ve used any high-end systems like the HTC Vive, Oculus Rift or PS VR, you’ll probably be annoyed by its constraints. With the high-end systems, the controllers are positionally tracked in-space; meanwhile, the Daydream controller is about as powerful as a Wiimote. This means you can use the controller’s accelerometer to manipulate an object or select interface items like a laser pointer, but you certainly won’t be using the controller as a lightsaber in any titles. The controller slots into the headset when it’s not in use, but I still bet a lot of people are going to lose this in no time. Bringing the controller into the mobile VR experience will really allow Daydream content to expand much further than Cardboard apps ever could. Virtual reality is currently in a position where it’s being defined by the influencers and insiders rather than regular consumers. Google wants to change that schema, but how it influences the industry as a whole depends on the standards developers choose to adopt. Thanks to the extensiveness of the Android platform it seems like Google can pretty much do whatever it wants, but if a company like Oculus can show off a mobile VR solution that gives developers more creative freedom, say a mobile VR headset with positional tracking, then it’s a little more up in the air. We don’t know what Oculus, which helps make Samsung’s Gear VR, has up its sleeve in terms of a renewed strategy for mobile, but we’ll likely hear more later this week at the company’s Oculus Connect 3 developer conference. Overall, the Daydream platform seems to be an updated version of Cardboard that actually works well. The headset is totally cool and, while it would’ve been nice to see Google push the innovation envelope a bit in terms of its first broad offering for Daydream, it’s clear that they’re aiming to satisfy the average user — even if that means hugging to the VR rulebook a bit. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Google Daydream Description Google Daydream is a simple VR headset that includes a single Daydream controller and connects wirelessly to the phone.

At $79, the Daydream View joins Samsung’s Gear VR among the cheaper headsets in the race, although the overall cost is higher because both require specific late-model smartphones. “The significance of Daydream is it should move the VR theme forward because it raises the hardware bar on phones needed for VR,” said a report from Piper Jaffray, which predicted that most smartphones running Google’s Android software will be made with Daydream in mind within five years. More news is expected this week at Oculus Connect, a three-day conference in San Jose sponsored by the Facebook-owned VR company. But even with the expected holiday sales push, VR is in its infancy. “The reality is that most people have yet to try VR,” said Mike Jazayeri, Google’s Daydream product director. Here are the main competitors: Daydream View: Headset and controller will cost $79 when it goes on sale in November at Verizon, Best Buy and the online Google store. Initially, the Daydream will work only with Google’s latest smartphone, the $649 Pixel. PlayStation VR: Due in stores and online Oct. 13. The headset alone costs $399, but a $499 bundle includes two PlayStation Move handheld controllers, a PlayStation camera and a game. However, the headset also requires a PlayStation 4 game console, which costs $300. Oculus Rift: The $599 headset, which went on sale this year, includes a sensor, remote, cables and an Xbox One controller. But the Rift requires a PC with a powerful graphics card and processors, which could send the overall cost past $1,500. HTC Vive: The headset, which also hit the market this year, costs $800, but also requires a high-end PC. Last week, HTC opened Viveport, an online store in 30 countries for non-gaming VR experiences to augment its selection of VR games. Samsung Gear VR: The $99 headset, developed by Samsung and Oculus, requires a Galaxy S6 or newer smartphone, or a Galaxy Note5 or newer phablet. Computer accessories maker Razer is also developing a headset called OSVR. The latest version costs $400. But those just curious about VR could also use cheap Google Cardboard viewers, which are often given away as a promotional item.

It’s as gorgeous, powerful, slick, and easily upgradeable as the iPhone. It’s the best Android phone of 2016 hands down. One question remains: Is this the Android phone that will make you want to leave the iPhone behind for good? A familiar design with a bit of Google magic Maybe it was that new phone feeling or the subtle little G for Google on the back of the phone, but the Pixel XL has a magic quality about it. This is it! The first Google Phone! Just like the majority of Android phones these days, the Pixel’s body is mostly aluminum. It looks like a cross between an iPhone and the Huawei Honor 8, thanks to a mixed media design that uses metal and glass; it’s high-end with nice texture. The phone feels silky smooth against your fingers and provides an interesting contrast of materials. Related: Don’t buy your Google Pixel from Verizon! Here’s why Of course, there are two huge problems with glass: It picks up fingerprints and it’s very fragile. Luckily, the glass panel is small and located up at the top of the phone, so you’re not likely to touch it too much. It picks up fingerprints, but not as many as a Galaxy S6 or S7. The part that gathers the most smudges and starts to look funky is the fingerprint sensor, which is also coated in glass. The glass doesn’t reach all the way up to the edge of the phone, so it shouldn’t crack if you drop it on its corners. However, if it falls at a weird angle or plunges to the concrete glass-face-first, it’ll crack — and probably be a pain to replace. Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends We’re not really fans of glass-backed phones, so we’re glad the Pixel is mostly metal. Still, you’ll probably want a case if you’re a klutz or you hate fingerprints. Luckily, Google lets you design your own Live Case with art, maps, or your own photos for $40. As far as comfort goes, the Pixel XL may be a big 5.5-inch phone, but it is comfortable to hold. It’s about the same size as the iPhone 7 Plus, but a little thicker and shorter. The phone’s edges have a slight ridge to them for added grip, and the metal feels sturdy. The volume rocker and power button are easy to locate and press, and the power button has a nice texture to it so you can tell which button is which. For ports, there’s a headphone jack at the top of the phone, a SIM card slot on the left side, and a USB Type-C port at the bottom along with the speakers. After a few months with the jackless iPhone 7 Plus, it was nice to plug our trusty headphones right into the 3.5mm jack. It’s so weird to find it at the top of the phone, though. What year is it? 2011? Powerful specs and smooth performance Google made one helluva phone. The sharp Quad HD screen with its 5.5-inch size and 2,560 × 1,440 pixel resolution looks great. It’s perfectly luminous and colorful. It looks gorgeous next to the screen on the iPhone 7 Plus and less over-saturated than the Galaxy S7 Edge. The Pixel XL runs silky smooth. We have yet to run into any hiccups, lag, or performance issues with the Pixel. Apps open quicker than ever; moving between home screens is smooth and fast; and content loads and scrolls without any stutters on apps like Twitter and Chrome. Everything just works. Google’s Pixel XL is the Android phone we’ve always wanted. When we first set up the phone, we downloaded 20 plus apps and dozens of songs for offline listening all while using the phone and setting up apps. The Pixel didn’t have a single problem through all this stress testing, though it started getting pretty hot. It eventually got so hot that it stalled for a few minutes and we had to restart it. But that only happened once. We think this may be a software issue and we’re asking Google about it. We had a similar heat episode when we first got our standard Pixel, but it also disappeared. Since then, we’ve had zero problems with it and it doesn’t run hot during ordinary use. That’s all thanks to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 821 and the 4GB of RAM. The Pixel comes with 32GB of internal storage, and there’s a 128GB variant as well — sadly, there is no MicroSD card slot. However, you get unlimited photo storage with Google Photos at full resolution on the Pixel, so you should be set. In case you want some benchmarks, we put the Pixel XL through a bunch of them: Quadrant: 29,827 3D Mark Slingshot: 2,313 Geekbench 4: 3,945 multi-core and 1,588 single-core AnTuTu: 138,946 In comparison, the Samsung Galaxy S7 scored 134,203 on the AnTuTu test and the LG G5 managed 134,074. The Pixel XL runs slightly ahead of its two big Android competitors. Meanwhile, the iPhone 7 has an AnTuTu score of 178,397, which clearly blows every Android phone out of the water. The A10 Fusion chip from Apple is sure to perform better, but benchmarks aren’t the end-all and be-all of performance. You’ll be more than satisfied with what the Pixel offers. Pure Android perfection There’s nothing like pure Android on a Pixel phone. Finally, we see a true marriage of hardware and software on one Google-made device. Android has never run smoother or looked better. The Pixel has a special launcher and unique features that you won’t find on any other Android phone. The entire experience is very polished. There’s no longer an icon for the app drawer, but you can still see all your apps with a single swipe up from the bottom of the screen. It feels smooth and intuitive. The lack of the app drawer icon unclutters the main interface, too. So all you see are the back, home, and multitasking icons. The Google search bar is artfully hidden, too. To access it, you just tap on the colorful G logo in the upper corner. Out pops your search bar and the microphone for voice queries. Google Now cards are also just a swipe away, as always. It feels more like iOS than ever before, so even long-time iPhone users will feel at home. Elegant design tweaks continue throughout the interface, including several that won’t be available on other Android phones when Android 7.1 drops. The new caller ID screen, the black notification drawer with a blue brightness slider, and the blue accents throughout the OS, like in the Settings menu, are exclusive to the Pixel. One of the more interesting additions is Quick Actions, which is similar to 3D Touch on iOS. Press and hold an icon and you’ll get shortcuts like “New Incognito Tab” on Chrome. You’ll have to wait for developers to add shortcuts for their apps, as right now only a handful of Google apps utilize the API. There’s nothing quite like Pure Android on a Pixel phone. At long last, Android also now has a native night mode called Night Light. It removes blue hues from your screen to help you sleep. This is one of my personal favorite additions. It’s just like Night Shift Mode on iOS, and it works just as well to help your eyes rest at night. You can also turn on fingerprint gestures on the device, so you can bring down the full notification drawer with two swipes. We don’t want to see this feature bloated with all sorts of gestures, but it would be killer if you could scroll a webpage or ask via the sensor on the back. Android 7.0 brought better functionality to the OS, and 7.1 refines on them further. Pixel offers the most fluid Android experiences we’ve seen to date. Assistant is really smart, but it’s not like Her … yet If you haven’t noticed, the navigation buttons are now solid white on the Pixel. There’s also a ring around the home button, and that’s to let you know that Google Assistant is available. Assistant is Google’s artificially intelligent bot that can help you with almost anything: search queries, checking your emails, translating text into other languages, and more. It’s essentially a more personalized Google Now, and it learns from you the more you use it. One of our favorite features is “My Day,” which you can trigger by saying “good morning,” once you’ve activated Assistant (say “Okay Google” or long-press the home button). Assistant will then read out your daily schedule, the weather, and more, but the best part is that it will automatically launch a playlist of news podcasts — ours started with NPR’s morning briefing, and continued with Fox News and so on. It’s one of those features you don’t know you need until you try it. Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends But at the same time, we sorely miss having a way to text to the Assistant, rather than talking to it with our voice. After all, you’re not always in a position to do so — and that’s why the Google search tab is integrated right into the home screen. Still, we’d have preferred a method to type, but we don’t expect one soon. A Google spokesperson tells Digital Trends the search giant is “starting with voice-only conversations with the Assistant on Pixel.” In that regard, Assistant is like Siri — you have to actually talk to her. Setting that aside, we’re still waiting on features that Assistant in Google’s Allo chat app can do that Assistant on the Pixel cannot. For example, you can’t set daily subscriptions to facts or the weather, but you can on Assistant in Allo. Google needs to unify what you can do with Assistant to all its platforms so people don’t get confused on what AI can or can’t do. The lack of features at launch may lose the launch momentum Google has with its AI and Pixel, but a source familiar to the matter told us there will be an update to add more features to Assistant on October 26. Hopefully it’s true and brings more capabilities. A killer camera You can’t go wrong with a high-end smartphone camera these days — They’re all awesome. The Pixel XL’s 12.3-megapixel camera with larger 1.55 micron pixels is outstanding. It takes splendid shots that rival the Galaxy S7 Edge, LG G5, and iPhone 7 Plus. It focuses super quickly and processes the automatic HDR+ mode with incredible speed. We were blown away with the level of detail in photos. In one close up of a bee on a flower, you can see the detail of its tiny iridescent wings and fuzzy body when you zoom in on the picture. That’s not something we’ve seen from a lot (any) phones before. We were also favorably impressed with the shots we took of an underground garden at Lowline Labs in NYC. Like many other Android phones, the Pixel XL does tend to boost the colors and saturation in images for a more heightened effect. The resulting images are more natural looking than what you’d get with a Galaxy S7 Edge, but less natural than images taken with the iPhone 7 Plus. A few shots turned out more blue than they really appeared in reality, but not by too much. In low-light scenarios, images are more colorful and bright, but a little less sharp than images shot on the  iPhone 7 Plus. Several features in the camera app are exclusive to the Pixel, such as a manual exposure slider, focus lock, tap-to-focus, and white balance — more options are always a good thing, but is it too much to ask for a timelapse setting? It is noticeably absent. In daylight, you’ll hardly ever have an issue with the camera, and the manual exposure option is a godsend for those times when the lighting is tricky. You can also use SmartBurst to capture multiple photos at once, or make a GIF. There’s even a fun lens blur feature that mimics the effect you get from the dual cameras on the iPhone 7 Plus with a nifty blurred background. It’s tricky to use. You select lens blur from the hamburger menu in the camera app, take the picture, and then you have to move your phone slowly upward with rock steady hands. Keeping it steady is hard, and we often failed to capture the image on time. However, the blurring did turn out well when we managed to do it right. We were blown away with the level of detail in photos taken with the Pixel XL. The iPhone 7 Plus’ camera wins against the Pixel XL on a few fronts: 2X hardware zoom, natural colors, and effortless lens blur DSLR-style effects. However, with ordinary use, the two cameras are more or less equal based on our initial testing. When it comes to video, the Pixel can take 4K videos at 30 frames-per-second, though the new feature is the gyro stabilization technique. It grabs gyro data about 200 times a second for so you end up with a smoother video. Videos are indeed smooth and shake-free, but you have to watch out when you turn — they tend to look a little too mechanical, as though a robot was swiveling in place. If you make sure you turn slowly, it doesn’t look as robotic. The icing on the cake of an already excellent camera is unlimited full-resolution Google Photos storage in the Photos app. It’s a Pixel exclusive, so all your Android-using friends should be deeply envious. Unlimited photo storage means you should be fine with 32GB of storage on the Pixel XL — unless you download tons of music, videos, and big apps. Battery life is normal Most phones last about a day to a day and a half and the Pixel XL is no exception. On the first day, I killed the battery very quickly because I couldn’t put the Pixel down. Once I cooled my jets, the battery life started to even out around a day to a day and a half. Related: Protect your Pixel XL with one of these tempting cases Busy days will force you to charge up at night, but normal days will give you a day and a half of battery life, easy. In other words, the Pixel XL is in the same boat as the iPhone 7 Plus and the Galaxy S7 Edge. It does have quick charging tech with that USB Type-C port, which is awesome. I love charging my phone up to nearly full in about 15 minutes. It’s brilliant, albeit common on Android. The iPhone 7 Plus doesn’t have that party trick. Warranty built-in customer service Google offers a standard one-year warranty on the Pixel XL. You can sign up for device protection for $100, but you won’t have to worry about high repair costs after damaging your phone. You’ll also get a replacement device as quickly as one business day after your claim is approved. To file a claim through Google’s partner Assurant, just call or go to mydeviceprotect.com. Each claim is subject to a deductible — $80 for Pixel and $100 for Pixel XL — and you can file up to two claims of accidental damage coverage within the 2-year term. Google Pixel XL Compared To ZTE Axon 7 HTC Bolt Google Pixel Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Meizu Pro 6 LG X Power LG V20 Apple iPhone 7 Huawei Honor 8 Lenovo Moto Z Alcatel Idol 4S Moto G4 Moto G4 Plus Samsung Galaxy S7 Active HTC 10 Quick repairs and replacements aren’t the only perks you get if you buy the Pixel XL. Much like Apple does with the iPhone, Google offers 24/7 support for your Pixel, in case you run into any issues. You can do this by visiting the Settings menu, and you can trigger a call or start a chat with a specialist. When you’re having more serious problems, you can share your screen to help get issues resolved faster. Once you give your number to support in the Settings app under Support, you’ll get a call from Google. We spoke with a Google support rep over the phone to see how the experience works. The rep was helpful and answered all our questions just like Apple’s support staff does in stores and online. We couldn’t try the Chat option, because it wasn’t live on our unit yet. It’s an excellent idea to offer customer support right on the device. It really puts the Pixel ahead of most Android phones. Security and software updates will come! Even more important that customer service, the Pixel smartphones, like the Nexus line, also gets fast security and Android version updates from Google. The updates will even automatically download when you’re not using your device (like at night), so that you never have to wait around for the new software to download or for it to finally arrive on your device. That means you’ll never be vulnerable to security flaws or hacks for extended periods of time because necessary patches will arrive immediately, and you’ll get new features first. Millions of Android phones are still vulnerable to hacks like Stagefright and Heartbleed, which allow hackers to remotely take over your device, steal passwords, and check out your private information. That’s dangerous and it’s wrong. Google is doing the right thing with its Pixel phones and all of its partners should take notice. Timely updates give the Pixel XL a leg up over the competition, as carriers and manufacturers are typically slow in issuing updates. Surprisingly, Verizon has come out and said it will not “stand in the way” of updates — your device will get it straight from Google, even if you buy it from Verizon (though we do not recommend it). Availability and pricing The Pixel XL is currently out of stock, so you’re in for a wait, but it is worth it. You can get it in silver, blue, or black. The black and blue colors are our personal favorites, though the blue one is even harder to come by. The Pixel XL starts at $770, which is pricey. It’s the same as the iPhone 7 Plus, LG V20, and Galaxy S7 Edge, which may put some people off. However, it’s worth the price over a ZTE Axon 7 or OnePlus 3. Our take The Pixel XL (and standard Pixel if you want a smaller phone) is our favorite Android phone, and the best one you can buy right now. The DT Accessory Pack Speck Presidio Grip Case $44.95 Native Union BELT Cable USB-C $29.99 Huawei Watch Stainless Steel $299.99 Is there a better alternative? There is no better Android phone in existence. The Pixel XL is the best Android phone we’ve ever used and the only one that has ever come this close to dethroning the iPhone. If you’re cheap, on a budget, and don’t care about important things like timely software updates and customer support, you’re welcome to check out the ZTE Axon 7 or the OnePlus 3, both of which offer similar specs for about $200-300 less. However, if you want the best Android phone ever, buy the Pixel XL. If you’re on the fence between the iPhone 7 Plus and the Pixel XL, you can’t go wrong with either. They are the two best phones that you can buy today — period. How long will it last? The Pixel XL should last you at least two to three years. Since it gets automatic software updates and security patches directly from Google, it is the most future-proof Android phone on the market. Should you buy it? Yes. This is the Android phone we’ve been waiting for. This is the one to buy. Go, buy it unlocked from the Google Play Store, though.

The new devices represent a big push by Google to make and sell its own hardware, instead of largely just supplying software for other manufacturers. At a starting price of roughly $650, the new Pixel phones are aimed at the same markets as Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy flagship phones. ___ IMF reduces its forecast for US economic growth this year WASHINGTON (AP) — The International Monetary Fund is downgrading its forecast for the U.S. economy this year and warns that political discontent threatens global growth. The IMF on Tuesday cut its estimate for U.S. economic growth in 2016 to 1.6 per cent from the 2.2 per cent it had predicted in July. The American economy grew 2.6 per cent in 2015. The fund's dimmer outlook for the U.S. occurs even as the Federal Reserve is thought to be preparing to raise interest rates in December. ___ As demand for cars falters, auto prices are poised to fall DETROIT (AP) — While the U.S. inched its way out of the Great Recession, consumers went car shopping in droves. As sales rebounded, the price of cars and trucks rose to record highs. Now, the price trend is set to reverse itself, partly because some buyers are unwilling or unable to pay the high prices and instead are opting for used cars. Sales to consumers are declining, so companies are ramping up incentives. Discounts in September hit a level not seen since automakers were desperate for sales during the financial crisis in late 2008. ___ Holiday sales expected to be up 3.6 per cent NEW YORK (AP) — Americans are expected to spend at a faster clip than last year for the critical holiday season, helped by an economy that should only continue to pick up, according to the nation's largest retail industry trade group. The National Retail Federation, based in Washington, D.C., is forecasting holiday sales for the November and December period to rise 3.6 per cent to $655.8 billion, much better than the 3 per cent growth seen in the year-ago period. The figure also is much higher than the 10-year average of 2.5 per cent and above the 3.4 per cent growth seen since the recovery began in 2009. ___ Stocks fall broadly on Wall Street along with bonds and gold NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks fell broadly on Tuesday, U.S. government bond prices also slumped, and gold had its worse day in nearly three years. Investors are nervous about the timing and the pace of any increase in the super-low interest rates controlled by the Federal Reserve, and comments from central bank officials recently have added to their jitters. Early gains quickly faded and the selling spread across industries. It was the second day of broad declines, a weak start to a new quarter after solid returns in recent months. ___ UK stock market just shy of record high as pound drops LONDON (AP) — Britain's main stock market fell agonizingly short of an all-time high on Tuesday amid a groundswell of optimism that exporters and multinationals will benefit from the pound's woes in the wake of the country's vote to leave the European Union in June. The pressure on the currency, particularly against the dollar where it is trading at 31-year lows, has mounted this week following comments from Prime Minister Theresa May that suggested the country could be heading for a definitive break from the European Union's single market. ___ Olive Garden sales improve, boosting parent company Darden ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Sales at Olive Garden improved in the latest quarter, helping parent company Darden post a higher quarterly profit from a year as it works to navigate changing dining habits. Darden Restaurants Inc. said sales at its existing Olive Garden locations rose 2 per cent in the quarter from a year ago and rose 1.3 per cent for across all its restaurant brands. The increase at Olive Garden was driven by higher prices and mix of more expensive items, while customer traffic slipped. Darden CEO Gene Lee noted the saturated restaurant market in the U.S. and newer competition from nontraditional businesses. ___ US probes complaints of more F-150 brake failures DETROIT (AP) — U.S. safety regulators are investigating whether a recall of Ford F-150 pickup trucks for brake failures should be expanded to more model years. The probe covers about 282,000 pickups with 3.5-litre six-cylinder engines from 2015 and 2016. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says it has received 25 complaints alleging sudden brake loss in the trucks. No crashes or injuries were reported. In May, Ford recalled about 271,000 six-cylinder F-150s from 2013 and 2014. The safety agency says it received 10 complaints about 2015 brake failures and another 15 about the 2016 models. Investigators will decide if the 2015 and 2016 models should be added to the recall. ___ Airlines begin to offer travel waivers for Hurricane Matthew Airlines are letting passengers change travel plans without penalty if their trip might be affected by Hurricane Matthew. American Airlines said Tuesday it will waive change fees on trips scheduled Thursday or Friday to or from eight cities in Florida. It had already offered waivers on trips scheduled through Thursday in several Caribbean nations including Cuba. Delta Air Lines is waiving change fees on trips through Wednesday in the Caribbean and through Thursday at eight Florida destinations United Airlines said it would waive change fees and any difference in fare for customers scheduled to fly Wednesday through Friday to, from or through five airports in Florida. ___ Toys R Us sells FAO Schwarz brand to ThreeSixty Group NEW YORK (AP) — Toys R Us has sold its FAO Schwarz brand to ThreeSixty Group, a company that designs and sells toys, home goods and other products. FAO Schwarz, founded in 1862, was known for its New York toy store that was a magnet for tourists who would play a tune on the store's floor piano or gawk at its large stuffed animals. But Toys R Us, which bought FAO Schwarz in 2009, shuttered the store last year to save money. The company did not disclose how much it paid for FAO Schwarz. ___ Ericsson cuts 3,000 jobs in Sweden, reduces operations STOCKHOLM (AP) — Ericsson said Tuesday it will cut 3,000 jobs in Sweden, or nearly 20 per cent of its local workforce, and will downsize operations at several plants as part of its global plan to cut costs by 9 billion kronor ($1 billion) in 2017. The Swedish networks company employs 115,000 people globally, of which 16,000 in Sweden, and said the layoffs are a necessary part of its transformation to meet "fast technology shifts and the digitalization of the telecom industry." The new demands will also create new jobs, Ericsson said, with plans to recruit 1,000 people in Sweden during the next three years. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average fell 85.40 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 18,168.45. The S&P 500 fell 10.71 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 2,150.49. The Nasdaq composite fell 11.22 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 5,289.66. U.S. benchmark crude oil fell 12 cents to close at $48.69 a gallon. Brent crude, the international standard, slipped 2 cents to close at $50.87 a barrel in London. Wholesale gasoline rose 3 cents to $1.50 a gallon, heating oil was little changed at $1.55 a gallon and natural gas increased 4 cents to $2.963 per 1,000 cubic feet.       E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article           Story Tools   E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article   Font: * * * * *   Image: * * * *     Related Topics   business FAO Inc.

However, it also introduced a variety of other new products designed for use in world driven increasingly by artificial intelligence and virtual-reality technologies. Ahead of the product announcements, Google CEO Sundar Pichai took to the stage to say that technology development today has reached a "seminal moment" by shifting from a mobile-first world to an AI-first world. Building on years of work and investment in machine learning, he added, Google is marking that shift by bringing its intelligent Google Assistant to both the new Pixel phones and the new smart Google Home device. Designed and built by Google, the Pixel smartphones (shown above) -- available for pre-ordering beginning today at a base price of $649 -- will also be the first phones to have built-in support for the company's new Daydream virtual-reality system. The $129 Google Home can also be pre-ordered starting today and are set to begin shipping on Nov. 4. 'A Personal Google for Everyone' "We're at a seminal moment in computing," Pichai said at the start of today's even. Following the previous technology milestones of personal computing, the Web and mobile computing, he claimed, we are now "moving from a mobile-first to an AI-first world." Google plans to help people make that transition by bringing its intelligent Google Assistant to devices anywhere and anytime, Pichai added. "Our goal is to build a personal Google for everyone." The first smartphones to feature Google Assistant built in, the 5-inch Pixel and 5.5-inch Pixel XL will also come with a number of other new features, including an advanced camera and unlimited cloud storage for photos and videos. According to Brian Rakowski, a member of Google's software product management team, the Pixel's camera received a quality rating of 89 -- "the highest rating ever for a smartphone" -- from DXOMark. The camera offers a Smartburst feature that captures a stream of photos rather than just one for photo optimization and uses algorithms to improve image quality "even in challenging conditions," Rakowski said. More Smart Devices, VR, WiFi and Chromecast Google Assistant will also be coming to Google Home, a smart-home appliance that will enable users to play music, ask questions, handle daily tasks and control other home devices using voice commands. In an on-stage demonstration, Google's Rishi Chandra showed how Google Home can be used to request specific song titles or even search for music with commands like, "Play that Shakira song from 'Zootopia.'" Using Google's own Knowledge Graph and other information resources, Google Home can also provide answers to questions, find information on coming local events, make restaurant and transportation reservations, check the weather and provide a summary of a user's daily personal calendar. "If the president can get a daily briefing, why shouldn't you?" Chandra asked. Other new products making their debut at today's event included the Daydream View virtual reality headset and controller, set to go on sale for $79 in November; Google WiFi for home wireless network management, available for pre-ordering starting in November at a price of $129 for one device and $299 for a three-pack; and the 4K Google Chromecast Ultra, available starting in November for $69.

I do appreciate How Allo works to our commands, as it does with Google Assistant. I have not purchased the Google Pixel. It certainly changes the way we perceive the matter. It is wonderful to individuals who work with technology knowledge and cater to the mind sets, as we all talk about artificial Intelligence. I think it is time that Google becomes the true knowledge based resource to the whole world. Certainly Google Pixel becomes a most needed resource for many in the world.

The search giant on Tuesday unveiled the first-ever Google-made smartphone, called the Pixel, as well as a virtual-reality headset and a $129 home speaker called Google Home that will take aim at Amazon’s popular $180 Echo. “We’re just getting started” with the hardware push, Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai admitted at a San Francisco shindig that was webcast Tuesday afternoon. While the hardware certainly stole the show, Google brass were equally keen on showing off how the new gadgets worked with Google Assistant, the latest version of the company’s voice-activated competitor to Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa. “In many ways, we’ve been working on this since Google was founded 18 years ago,” Pichai said, touting Google Assistant’s prowess in voice recognition, image recognition, machine learning and artificial intelligence. “Remember my bike combo is 3-2-6,” a user told the digital helper in a video demo, getting the response, “Got it.” More than a few attendees must have sensed the execs at the Mountain View, Calif., tech behemoth were oblivious to growing privacy concerns around voice-activated software. Google’s Pixel phone will cost $649 — a bit less than Apple’s iPhone 7, priced at about $800 — but otherwise a gadget that looks a lot like its Cupertino, Calif.-designed rival. Except the Pixel has a headphone jack. A larger, $769 “Pixel XL” model with a 5.5-inch screen, versus 5 inches for the regular Pixel, will also be available. Pixels can also get seven hours of battery time on a 15-minute charge, execs said. Both will be launched exclusively on Verizon. “There’s no unsightly ‘camera bump,’ ” added Google hardware chief Rick Osterloh, noting that the Pixel’s camera lens didn’t awkwardly protrude from the back the way those of recent iPhone models do. The real selling point, execs said, is that the Pixel’s integration with Google Assistant, which it says can give smoother interactions and better answers than the competition. Brian Rakowski, head of software product management for the Pixel, demonstrated how the new phone used Google Assistant’s advanced algorithms to give directions and reviews for an Italian restaurant his wife mentioned in a text message — without even being asked to do so. Google Home will hit retail stores next month. SEE ALSO Here's how the iPhone 7's speed stacks up to other phones :0 The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are out, which... Here's how the iPhone 7's speed stacks up to other phones Amazon released the Echo nearly two years ago. The Echo has a software developer’s kit that’s now used by more than 3,000 third-party developers to play music, provide weather forecasts, keep shopping lists and order food. Google Assistant will launch an SDK for third parties next year, execs said. Elsewhere, Google unveiled a VR headset it calls “Daydream View,” which uses a smartphone and will begin selling next month at $79. Google also is launching a new line of Wi-Fi routers ($129 each, $299 for a set of three), and is updating its ChromeCast TV dongle to stream 4K videos.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Google Home, AI-powered Smart Speaker Costs $129, Cheaper than Amazon Echo By Eliane Fiolet on 10/04/2016 15:10 PST Google Home, the competitive smart speaker to the Amazon Echo, unveiled at Google I/O, officially launched today. Now available for pre-order for $129 and shipping on November 4th, Google Home is powered by Google Assistant, the voice activated and AI-driven virtual assistant also built-in the new Google Pixel smartphone. Just by talking to your Google Home, you will be able to start playing music, get answers from Google, manage everyday tasks (thanks to the Assistant) and control devices around the house. Besides being cheaper than Echo, Google Home delivers better intelligence, a multi-room feature, and a super stylish design. And, according to the demo on stage, a great integration with multiple Google services such as Google Play and Google Chromecast. However, Amazon Alexa, the software that powers Echo has already integrated with hundreds of third party services, while Google showcased only a few, such as Spotify, Pandora, Tune In, SmartThings, IFTTT, Uber… Industrial Design and Hardware (very good) Stylish and neutral industrial design The Google Home was “inspired by objects commonly found in homes like wine glass or candles”, and the design team worked with a white top and a clean dynamic shape to deliver a neutral look that aims to blend into your living room. Consumers will be able to customize their Google Home with 7 different colors and 2 different materials for the speaker cover at the bottom: the fabric version is available in Mango, Marine, Violet, and the metal version in Carbon, Snow, or Copper. The gray version might be either made of fabric or metal. Great user interface with subtle feedback The top lights up with four colored LEDs (blue, red, yellow, green) to let you know it is listening, when the user activates Home by saying “ok Google”, the magic sentence used by all Google voice-activated devices, such as Android Wear powered smartwatches, or Android Auto compatible cars. The top surface is also a capacitive touch panel that allows to pause the music, change the volume or starts the Google Assistant. Top voice recognition and audio According to Google, the hardware delivers best in class voice recognition, thanks to the far field microphone and machine learning algorithm that helped to recognized hundreds of sounds pattern to separate speech from background noises. The company also claims the audio quality is amazing. We will need to check that when we get our hands on the device. How does it work? On stage, Rishi Chandra showed a few demos of Google home’s capabilities, see below a few examples he provided on stage: 1/ Enjoy Music from multiple sources Basically, you can ask Google home to play your favorite music, and you can tweak the volume just by asking for it. For now, the device is compatible with Google play, Spotify, Pandora, TuneIn and soon will integrate with iHeart Radio. The intelligence behind the software allows to requesting songs according to your mood or a category, such as “workout” music for example. The music search is powered by Google so, in case you do not remember a song title, you can describe it with context to retrieve it. Additionally, you can listen to radio stations, podcasts or news feed from NPR, and music from your Android and iOS devices. 2/ Get answers from Google Google Home takes advantage of the knowledge graph defined by the Google Search team over the years, that now “has over 70 billion facts” according to Sundar Pichai, CEO, Alphabet. To demonstrates its power, Rishi Chandra started to ask what is Adele’s real name and Home answered right away ”it is Adele Laurie Blue Adkins”. And then, he asked: “how many Grammy has she won”. The answers came from Wikipedia. Google Search can look for answers from top expert websites as well, for more specific queries such as “can dogs eat chocolate” or how to remove a wine stain from a cloth. Assisting users while they travel is a key competitive advantage, thanks to Google’s map and translation services that can be activated with voice queries. 3/ Manage everyday tasks with Google Assistant The My Day feature summarizes important topics for the user in a very compelling way. You can activate it simply by saying “Ok Google, good morning!” while drinking your first coffee, then Home tells you the time, the weather report, your commuting time, the traffic status, and reminders of your tasks for the day. Rishi compared it to the President’s daily briefing. The built-in Google Assistant can also help you around the home when you are planning a dinner for example. It helps with the shopping list and the nutrition facts, and sets multiple timers for cooking, everything is done only by using voice commands. Since Google Assistant is integrated to the Pixel smartphone as well, it displays the shopping list there upon request. Google Assistant lets you interact with your favorite apps, as it was demoed later with the Uber app, via a smart conversation with the system. 4/ Control your devices at home As we all knew it for a while, Google stated that voice will become the standard way to interact with your devices in the near future. The company partnered with Nest, Philips Hue, SmartThings and IFTTT. As you may know, Nest, an Alphabet/google company, offers the smart thermostat, the smart smoke detector, the smart surveillance camera, Philips sells the most popular connected light bulb on the market, the Hue, and SmartThings, acquired two years ago by Samsung, offers the SmartThings Hub that is compatible with about 200 devices for the smart home. Google plans to announce more partnerships in order to remote control as many devices as possible from its Home smart speaker. Integration with Google Chromecast In case you are one of the 30 million Chromecast users, you will enjoy a better experience with the ability to voice control your TV and speakers. We got a demo of the feature with the query “Ok Google play a Katy Perry latest music video on my TV”. The voice commands can also control playback, and continue to control the video on other android devices seamlessly. In addition to YouTube videos, users will also be able to control Netflix movies, and Google plans to add more partnerships like this one in the future. Combined with the in-image search capabilities of Google Photo, you can voice search for your photos and display them on your TV. The Google intelligent speaker will also work with Chromecast Audio, so it will be able to control your speaker’s system, without any wires or cables. Any Google Cast-enabled TV or speakers made by OEMs will be compatible with Google Home as well. The system Google Home + Chromecast truly delivers a complete hands-free control of the TV, so the traditional remote control may be dead now (or soon)! Multi-room Support Besides the search engine and the AI-powered Google Assistant, the multi-room audio support is one of the unique features that is absent from competitive product Amazon Echo. Multi-room support enables multiple Google Home devices to play the same song in different rooms at the same time, and you can add Chromecast Audio or Cast-speakers to the group. Additionally, Google designed the Assistant to be context-aware (see graphic above), so only the closest smart speaker will respond, and it will respond intelligently across your Home and Android devices. Basically, the right device will answer your question right away. Pricing and availability Google Home is now available for pre-order for $129 with a 6-month free subscription for YouTube Red, that gives access to YouTube Music, Google Play Music, and the ad-free version of YouTube. You can pre-order Google Home in the U.S. today from Google Store, Best Buy, Walmart and Target and it will ship on November 4th in retail stores. Conclusion (Excellent on the paper, better than Amazon Echo) At Ubergizmo we are big fans of the Amazon Echo for various reasons. We love to ask all kinds of questions using our voice from anywhere in the room, without the need to look for our smartphone. In the morning, when I wake up, I love to ask Alexa to read me the NPR news out loud with my eyes still closed, since I need 30 minutes to totally wake up and jump out of my bed. Those examples are just a few among the limitless applications you will be able to get from intelligent speakers connected to thousands of services. My only concern is with privacy, although Google assured that Home starts to listen to you only when you say “ok Google”, however, I am not sure if it cannot be hacked, just like webcams, and controlled to constantly listen. Google Home looks even smarter on the paper with more capabilities such as the multi-room feature and the super stylish design! Filed in Cellphones >Home.

(c'mon dude) or "What are some nearby camping stores?" And then it can also give you a traffic report for getting to the camping store you want to go to.  We'll see how this actually works in practice, but Google's knowledge base and Google app integration with your other devices (e.g. Maps on your phone) definitely seems like an advantage.  Home is also integrated with some common smart home products: &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;img src="http://static.digg.com/images/026f7f3b77514494ad641efbcad47cba_2dYmP6w_1_post.jpeg" alt="" /&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;   And you can also use it to control your Chromecast (you don't have to watch Katy Perry):  &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;img src="http://static.digg.com/images/d738eef313b44fe0915f6eec99d28f97_2dYmP6w_1_post.jpeg" alt="" /&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;   Voice integration with YouTube is built-in, and integration with Netflix is coming.  Google wants you to have multiple Google Homes in your home: &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;img src="http://static.digg.com/images/983b845b289d44409499d5e38d89750f_2dYmP6w_1_post.jpeg" alt="" /&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;   You can preorder the Home today; it ships November 4th.  Google Assistant Actions Google is working on a lot of integrations for Google Assistant, so that businesses can jump into your Assistant, like Uber: &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;img src="http://static.digg.com/images/90a33bb2ee5a4bdba0610ea3d15e1cc4_2dYmP6w_1_post.jpeg" alt="" /&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;   These are some of their launch partners:  &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;img src="http://static.digg.com/images/495e324cf35d499bb23e739a0e783109_2dYmP6w_1_post.jpeg" alt="" /&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;   Other Stuff Apple got James Corden to open up its event...

At a starting price of roughly $650, the new Pixel phones are aimed at the same markets as Apple’s iPhone and Samsung’s Galaxy flagship phones. ___ IMF reduces its forecast for US economic growth this year WASHINGTON (AP) — The International Monetary Fund is downgrading its forecast for the U.S. economy this year and warns that political discontent threatens global growth. The IMF on Tuesday cut its estimate for U.S. economic growth in 2016 to 1.6 per cent from the 2.2 per cent it had predicted in July. The American economy grew 2.6 per cent in 2015. The fund’s dimmer outlook for the U.S. occurs even as the Federal Reserve is thought to be preparing to raise interest rates in December. ___ As demand for cars falters, auto prices are poised to fall DETROIT (AP) — While the U.S. inched its way out of the Great Recession, consumers went car shopping in droves. As sales rebounded, the price of cars and trucks rose to record highs. Now, the price trend is set to reverse itself, partly because some buyers are unwilling or unable to pay the high prices and instead are opting for used cars. Sales to consumers are declining, so companies are ramping up incentives. Discounts in September hit a level not seen since automakers were desperate for sales during the financial crisis in late 2008. ___ Holiday sales expected to be up 3.6 per cent NEW YORK (AP) — Americans are expected to spend at a faster clip than last year for the critical holiday season, helped by an economy that should only continue to pick up, according to the nation’s largest retail industry trade group. The National Retail Federation, based in Washington, D.C., is forecasting holiday sales for the November and December period to rise 3.6 per cent to $655.8 billion, much better than the 3 per cent growth seen in the year-ago period. The figure also is much higher than the 10-year average of 2.5 per cent and above the 3.4 per cent growth seen since the recovery began in 2009. ___ Stocks fall broadly on Wall Street along with bonds and gold NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks fell broadly on Tuesday, U.S. government bond prices also slumped, and gold had its worse day in nearly three years. Investors are nervous about the timing and the pace of any increase in the super-low interest rates controlled by the Federal Reserve, and comments from central bank officials recently have added to their jitters. Early gains quickly faded and the selling spread across industries. It was the second day of broad declines, a weak start to a new quarter after solid returns in recent months. ___ UK stock market just shy of record high as pound drops LONDON (AP) — Britain’s main stock market fell agonizingly short of an all-time high on Tuesday amid a groundswell of optimism that exporters and multinationals will benefit from the pound’s woes in the wake of the country’s vote to leave the European Union in June. The pressure on the currency, particularly against the dollar where it is trading at 31-year lows, has mounted this week following comments from Prime Minister Theresa May that suggested the country could be heading for a definitive break from the European Union’s single market. ___ Olive Garden sales improve, boosting parent company Darden ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Sales at Olive Garden improved in the latest quarter, helping parent company Darden post a higher quarterly profit from a year as it works to navigate changing dining habits. Darden Restaurants Inc. said sales at its existing Olive Garden locations rose 2 per cent in the quarter from a year ago and rose 1.3 per cent for across all its restaurant brands. The increase at Olive Garden was driven by higher prices and mix of more expensive items, while customer traffic slipped. Darden CEO Gene Lee noted the saturated restaurant market in the U.S. and newer competition from nontraditional businesses. ___ US probes complaints of more F-150 brake failures DETROIT (AP) — U.S. safety regulators are investigating whether a recall of Ford F-150 pickup trucks for brake failures should be expanded to more model years. The probe covers about 282,000 pickups with 3.5-litre six-cylinder engines from 2015 and 2016. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says it has received 25 complaints alleging sudden brake loss in the trucks. No crashes or injuries were reported. In May, Ford recalled about 271,000 six-cylinder F-150s from 2013 and 2014. The safety agency says it received 10 complaints about 2015 brake failures and another 15 about the 2016 models. Investigators will decide if the 2015 and 2016 models should be added to the recall. ___ Airlines begin to offer travel waivers for Hurricane Matthew Airlines are letting passengers change travel plans without penalty if their trip might be affected by Hurricane Matthew. American Airlines said Tuesday it will waive change fees on trips scheduled Thursday or Friday to or from eight cities in Florida. It had already offered waivers on trips scheduled through Thursday in several Caribbean nations including Cuba. Delta Air Lines is waiving change fees on trips through Wednesday in the Caribbean and through Thursday at eight Florida destinations United Airlines said it would waive change fees and any difference in fare for customers scheduled to fly Wednesday through Friday to, from or through five airports in Florida. ___ Toys R Us sells FAO Schwarz brand to ThreeSixty Group NEW YORK (AP) — Toys R Us has sold its FAO Schwarz brand to ThreeSixty Group, a company that designs and sells toys, home goods and other products. FAO Schwarz, founded in 1862, was known for its New York toy store that was a magnet for tourists who would play a tune on the store’s floor piano or gawk at its large stuffed animals. But Toys R Us, which bought FAO Schwarz in 2009, shuttered the store last year to save money. The company did not disclose how much it paid for FAO Schwarz. ___ Ericsson cuts 3,000 jobs in Sweden, reduces operations STOCKHOLM (AP) — Ericsson said Tuesday it will cut 3,000 jobs in Sweden, or nearly 20 per cent of its local workforce, and will downsize operations at several plants as part of its global plan to cut costs by 9 billion kronor ($1 billion) in 2017. The Swedish networks company employs 115,000 people globally, of which 16,000 in Sweden, and said the layoffs are a necessary part of its transformation to meet “fast technology shifts and the digitalization of the telecom industry.” The new demands will also create new jobs, Ericsson said, with plans to recruit 1,000 people in Sweden during the next three years. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average fell 85.40 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 18,168.45. The S&P 500 fell 10.71 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 2,150.49. The Nasdaq composite fell 11.22 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 5,289.66. U.S. benchmark crude oil fell 12 cents to close at $48.69 a gallon. Brent crude, the international standard, slipped 2 cents to close at $50.87 a barrel in London. Wholesale gasoline rose 3 cents to $1.50 a gallon, heating oil was little changed at $1.55 a gallon and natural gas increased 4 cents to $2.963 per 1,000 cubic feet. shares Share: Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Share Email Advertisement Advertisement    Leave a comment Hide comments Comments are closed.

What we learned today: Chief executive Shayne Elliott said a bank tribunal would be a “good idea”, joining CBA chief executive Ian Narev who expressed openess to the idea. The ANZ chief executive revealed the bank is considering whether to stop giving political donations. Elliott suggested the bank had an “appetite” to restructure credit card interest rates, including possibly dropping headline rates. Two ANZ employees were fired for code-of-conduct breaches, but others whose actions are the subject of an Asic case on rigging the bank bill swap rate have been reinstated because the bank concluded they had done nothing wrong. ANZ executives had no difficulty responding to questions about the bank’s role in the aftermath of Timbercorp’s collapse, and denied any link to the 1MDB scandal. Elliott accepted that banks had not always met standards and apologised for any harm caused.

Deputy chief executive, Graham Hodges, says the delay can be caused by determining what the best interest rate is and moving rates at a convenient time to avoid multiple movements rather than a calculation that the bank makes money for every day it delays a rate cut.

He says ANZ wants to move rates on a more regular basis, but “people expect them ... shortly after [Reserve Bank] moves, so that’s what we will do”.

ANZ chief Shayne Elliott denies this reflects lack of competition – and points to the fact the risks on small business loans secured by a house are 10 times greater than a home loan. A regulatory change also increased the amount of capital that needs to be held by 60% relative to a home loan. Asked if there has been a substantial increase in risk in lending to small business, he replies: No. This was covered yesterday – it reflects that the risk was incorrectly priced in the past.

More than $US1bn is alleged to have flowed into Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak’s bank ­accounts between January 2011 and April 2013 — much of it from 1MDB. ANZ chief executive Shayne Elliott says he is satisfied nobody employed by ANZ did anything wrong and the bank was not being investigated by the US Justice Department.

Deputy chief executive Graham Hodges denies imposing any conditions to control how Timbercorp dealt with its investors except for “normal [conditions] around credit criteria to support a securitisation structure”. Asked what input ANZ has had in the liquidation process, Hodges says it encouraged establishment of a hardship program. Bandt asks for all ANZ documents relating to Timbercorp and its liquidator, and will make a more specific request in writing. ANZ takes it on notice.

CEO Shayne Elliott responds: We justify it by saying we are supporting the democratic process in the country. Elliott denies the bank considers donations an “investment” to achieve outcomes such as avoiding a bank royal commission. He reveals that there are “discussions at the board level about the role of political donations” and whether to continue making them. It comes after NAB’s board of directors said it “resolved in May 2016 that the making of any political donations would cease with immediate effect”, according to its policy statement on political donations.

The pay of a teller is “about the $50-60,000 mark”. He says contingent elements of pay are based on performance metrics including people management, financial results and customer satisfaction. Balance is key to ensure remuneration based on performance is a “healthy driver in their behaviour and doesn’t drive poor outcomes”, he says. Updated at 8.54pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.25pm EDT 20:25 Deputy chief executive, Graham Hodges, says ANZ will “always provide assistance” when customers say they are experiencing hardship. He says the customers’ issues are “not just the card itself” but other financial problems, including bills and unexpected events. “That’s what financial hardship is,” Labor MP Matt Keogh responds. He suggests that given evidence that 90% of customers experience hardship because of unexpected events after getting a card, 10% must have had financial problems when they got the card. Chief executive Shayne Elliott responds that they may simply have overextended themselves after the bank gave them credit.

October 5, 2016 Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.00pm EDT 20:00 ANZ has "appetite" to reconsider credit card interest rates Shayne Elliott says ANZ has an “appetite” to consider restructuring its credit card products. He concedes the headline interest rate on credit card rates may be too high and could be changed so that there is a “better correlation between pricing and risk”. Liberal MP Scott Buchholz heralds the concession (without a commitment) as “a good day for Australians”. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.55pm EDT 19:55 Liberal MP Scott Buccholz has challenged the proposition in Shayne Elliott’s opening statement that ANZ wants credit card rates to be “as low as possible”. The chief executive qualifies that he meant: “as low as possible, competitively”. Deputy chief executive, Graham Hodges, says the bank has run a trial with 1% of its customers who showed signs of financial hardship to suggest they use different products like a different credit card. Some were “quite offended” others found it “very helpful”, he said. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.45pm EDT 19:45 Pat Conroy has asked whether the government and Reserve Bank implicitly subsidise the big four banks to the tune of $3.7bn because of the fact they are “too big to fail”. The deputy chief executive, Graham Hodges, disputes that this constitutes “government support”. Rather it is the markets and ratings agencies which have a view that Australian banks have a higher credit rating because of a perception that authorities would step in in the event of financial crisis, he says. Updated at 8.01pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.41pm EDT 19:41 Pat Conroy has asked about ANZ’s return on equity in its credit card business. Shayne Elliott repeats a similar objection to the CBA’s, that it is “difficult for us to disclose without giving away competitive information”. He accepts the return on equity for credit cards is higher and “well above” average but says it is “decreasing at a fairly fast rate”. Updated at 8.00pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.36pm EDT 19:36 The Labor MP Pat Conroy has asked if Shayne Elliott is confident that bank managers don’t put pressure on tellers to refer customers to financial planners after they’d already met their minimum targets. The chief executive sys: “No, and I’m not necessarily sure that’s a bad thing.” If we believe having good conversations with specialists is a good thing, then generally more is better. If staff feel under duress, pressure or are harassed there are avenues for them to discuss that.

The Pixel in black. Here's the "Really Blue" option, which has a white front and blue sides. The back of the black Pixel. That window is actual glass, not plastic. The back of the "Really Blue" version is, well, really blue. The bottom houses a pair of speaker ports (but only one speaker) and a USB-C port. The top has a headphone jack. The side of the devices has only a SIM card slot. Power and volume on the other side, like normal. Left: The $379 Nexus 5X, Right: The $649 Pixel. The 5-inch Pixel versus the 5-inch Nexus. The 5.7-inch Nexus 6P versus the 5.5-inch Pixel XL. The back of the two devices. The Pixel XL on top of the Nexus 6P. The Pixel XL on top of the Nexus 6P. SAN FRANCISCO—Google just unleashed a whopping five hardware products today, and I spent plenty of time trying them. The first and most important release is the Google Pixel, Google's new flagship smartphones. At $649 for the Pixel and $769 for the Pixel XL, Google is charging a lot more for the Pixel than it has for the Nexus devices. It's attacking the premium end of the market, and these definitely seem like premium phones. In fact, they remind me a lot of one particular premium smartphone—the iPhone. I say that both as a complaint and a compliment. Both phones are extremely well made, with the aluminum back, glass rear window, and glass front forming a shell that really feels like it's worth the price tag. The design is also extremely derivative, to the point that I almost picked up someone's iPhone on a display table thinking it was a Pixel. The iPhone and Pixel share similar bezel sizes, but the iPhone has the excuse of having a hardware home button. Nothing takes up this vast amount of space on the front of the Pixel. The only unique part of the design is the glass window on the rear, which both allows RF signals to escape and serves as the camera lens. You will find a minor change to the iPhone design on the sides, which starts as a rounded edge on the Pixel but is interrupted by a bezel around the perimeter of the back (like the HTC 10). This is an HTC-made device by the way, which Google will freely admit if you ask. At least with the higher price tag comes a set of top-tier specs. The highlight is probably the storage solution, which uses UFS 2.0. We didn't have a chance to run a storage benchmark, but hopefully they'll be somewhere near the speed of high-end Samsung phones. The days of Google phones having slow storage should be over. The Pixel phones will be one of the first devices to run the Snapdragon 821 SoC, which has a top speed of 2.4Ghz but Google chose to clock the chip back down to 2.15GHz. This makes it just a minor revision to the 820. The Google Assistant is an exclusive feature of the phone phones. The Google Assistant is an exclusive feature of the phone phones. Hold down the home button and four dots will fly out of it, activating the assistant. The Assistant interface looks a lot like Allo—it's a chat bot. Round icons for all the Google apps, but none of the third-party apps. The minorly redesigned settings app. Quick access to Google support. The best reason to buy a Pixel might actually be the software. Google is keeping the Google Assistant exclusive to the Pixel phones, at least for now. Long pressing on the home button activates the Assistant, which will pop up and answer questions. On a phone it looks a lot like it does on Google Allo, showing a chat-style interface that contains your questions along with the results. There are smart reply responses that allow you to drill down on the result, too. For instance, saying "show me restaurants nearby" will show a carousel with results, and then "Italian," "Chinese" and other restaurant types will be shown as smart reply options. This is also the first device to launch with Android 7.1. The new build of Android (still called Nougat) is mostly a collection of minor APIs that enable Pixel features. There are things like a "Shortcut launcher API" which can somewhat replicate Apple's 3D Touch on the home screen, but as far as we know this doesn't work yet. There's also "Night Light" mode (which turns the UI brown), circular icon support, and support for fingerprint scanner gestures. Some improvements to existing Android 7.0 features are included, like Seamless Updates and Daydream VR. There are tons of aesthetic changes on top of this, like solid white System UI buttons, circular home screen icons, and a redesigned settings app. Inside the settings app is a "support" tab that offers a 24/7 link to Google support. A new "screen share" option even allows support to see your device. We'll need a lot more time to test out the camera properly, but Google promises this will be one of the best cameras on the market. The camera app did start-up very fast, but we'll have to see how consistent that is after more usage. At first blush, the hardware is fine. It's just so much like an iPhone that it doesn't even seem "new." It lacks excitement and identity. The software looks interesting though, and I look forward to digging in for a full review. But no matter what, Google's update speed automatically makes this one of the best Android devices currently available.

The two seem squarely aimed at the new iPhone 7 models from Apple. Pixel Highlights The Pixel has a 1080 x 1920 screen resolution, giving a pixel density of 440 ppi. The XL model’s display has a 1440 x 2560 resolution, so it’s at 534 ppi. Internally, these are nearly identical. Each is built around a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor that includes a pair of 2.15GHz cores and a second pair of 1.6GHz cores, an arrangement intended to combine performance and battery life. They have 4GB of RAM, and will be available with 32GB or 128GB of storage. The Pixel phones are debuting with Android 7.1 Nougat, and Google has committed to making operating system updates available for them as soon as possible. This is in contrast to typical Android models that generally don’t get OS upgrades for months, if at all, as the new versions have to flow through their device manufacturers. Other Hardware Both include a 12.3 megapixel rear camera, with an f/2.0 aperture. A gyroscope-based video stabilization is being strongly touted, as well as quick image captures. All images and video taken with this camera can be backed up on Google’s servers at no charge. It also shoots 4k video. The Pixel sports a 3,450mAh battery, while the XL has a 2,770mAh battery. Google is promising extremely fast recharges: up to seven hours of use after being plugged in for 15 minutes. Other features include USB-C, a fingerprint scanner, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Casings are aluminum and glass, available in black, silver, and blue. HTC is producing the hardware. Pixel vs. iPhone 7 Comparisons between the just announced Pixel phones and the recently-released iPhone 7 series are inevitable, as these are flagship products with prices that start about $650. In addition, both Google and Apple offer their respective models in two sizes, and directly distribute operating system updates. Each device maker emphasizes the camera capabilities of their phones. Google is especially pushing the Pixel’s HDR capabilities, which result in richer photos, and smart burst shooting, which automatically selects the best shot in a quickly-shot series. According to DxO Mark, an industry group focused on photography, the Pixel phones are the highest scoring smartphone cameras of all time, with a score of 89, ahead of the iPhone 7 (86), and new Samsung Galaxy S7 handsets (88). Prices and Availability A Google Pixel with 32GB of storage is $649, and can be pre-ordered now. The 128GB version is $100 more. The 32GB Pixel XL is $769, and the 128GB XL is $869. U.S. residents already reaching for their wallets should be aware that the Pixel series is mostly going to be a Verizon exclusive, but it will work with Project Fi.

Oct 4th 2016, 10:55 PM 26,640 Views 50 Comments Share45 Tweet Email1 The new Google Pixel phone Source: Eric Risberg GOOGLE HAS OPENED fire on its rivals Apple, Samsung and Amazon in a new push into hardware – and this time the global giant is aiming at the smartphone market. The company has today launched its premium-priced Pixel smartphones and a slew of other devices showcasing artificial intelligence (AI) prowess. The unveiling of Google’s in-house designed phone came as part of an expanded hardware move by the US company, which also revealed details of its new “home assistant” virtual reality headset and Wi-Fi router system. Today’s event in San Francisco marked a shift in strategy for Google, which is leading a major push to make Google Assistant artificial intelligence a futuristic force spanning all kinds of internet-linked devices. Google chief executive Sundar Pichai said the new devices were part of Google’s strategy to bring artificial intelligence to a range of new devices. “We are evolving from a mobile-first world to an AI-first world,” he said, adding that the latest push is an extension of the Google search capacity by assisting consumers in finding and organising information. Our goal is to build a personal Google for each and every user. Rick Osterloh, head of a new hardware division at the California-based giant, added: “We believe that the next big innovation is going to take place at the intersection of hardware and software, with AI at the centre.” Pixel will be available with a 5 or 5.5 inch display, starting at $649 (€579) for US customers, at similar prices to the latest iPhone models. Pre-orders began today in Australia, Canada, Germany, Britain, and the United States. Made by Google Google, by using its own name on handsets, is aiming for a bigger slice of a competitive smartphone market dominated by Samsung and Apple. Source: Eric Risberg Until now, Google’s flagship devices had used the Nexus brand with hardware partners that have included China’s Huawei and South Korea’s LG. The California group also sought to expand in the smartphone market by purchasing Motorola in 2011, but sold that unit less than three years later. “Google today demonstrated that it’s finally serious about hardware,” said Jan Dawson at Jackdaw Research. “The Pixel phones are clearly being positioned as peers to the iPhone.” The new Pixel phone is “the first phone made by Google inside and out”, said Sabrina Ellis of the Pixel product management team. By producing both the hardware and Android software, Google is making a more direct assault on Apple and its tightly controlled ecosystem. Along with being the first smartphone to ship with Google Assistant, it will come with unlimited storage for photos and videos and be compatible with the company’s new Daydream virtual reality platform. Pixel has a “smart” camera which can select the best images from a stream, and a program to make it easy for users to switch operating systems, a move aimed at winning over iPhone users. Analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights and Strategy said it may be challenging for Google to gain market share. Google CEO Sundar Pichai speaking at today's event Source: Eric Risberg “Aside from the camera, the new Google Pixels are pretty undifferentiated compared to Samsung and iPhone seventh generation phones,” Moorhead said. They don’t exactly swing anyone around the room. Apple’s world Gartner analyst Brian Blau said that “the most exciting part of the announcement today was the assistant”, which showcases Google’s strength in artificial intelligence. “It’s a different tactic from Google, taking the stance that they want to have that direct relationship with their customers,” Blau told AFP. Google's new Daydream View virtual reality headset Source: Eric Risberg “It is clearly a step into Apple’s world,” of controlling hardware and software and services, he added. Pixel will be sold through US carrier Verizon and telecom groups, and available at Google’s online shop unlocked. As part of its expanded hardware push, Google also showed off a new Daydream View headset that compatible smartphones can be slipped into to serve as screens for virtual reality experiences. View headsets are made of soft cloth, purportedly inspired by casual clothes. Daydream View bundled with a controller device will be available in November, priced at $79 (€70). Google has also added to the coming hardware line-up with a modular Wi-Fi system that lets a set of inter-connected mini-modems be spread around homes to make signals strong in all spots. A Google Home Wi Fi unit on display at today's event Source: Eric Risberg “Unlike a single, central router, multiple Google Wi-Fi points do a better job of delivering connectivity to all parts of the home,” said Google executive Mario Queiroz. The internet giant also introduced its Google Home virtual assistant that will be a direct challenge to popular Amazon Echo devices. Google described Home as a voice-activated assistant that lets people tap into the company’s online capabilities to answer questions, manage tasks, control devices in homes, stream videos and more. The $129 (€115) Google Home device will be available in retail shops on 4 November. © – AFP, 2016 Read: Enda Kenny announces 100% fibre-optic broadband for his hometown Read: Meet Kirobo, Toyota’s new friendly robot that could cure your loneliness Get breaking news from TheJournal.ie via Facebook.

Just how good is the camera? See for yourself: we snagged all the sample photos from the Pixel library and put them in a big gallery below. They may look like stock photos, but if you check the EXIF data, you’ll find they were indeed taken with either the Pixel and Pixel XL. You’ll also notice how Google showcases the camera’s strengths by taking a variety of photos in a multitude of settings, including macro shots, low light photos, and even aerial pictures from a drone. Also note that the Pixel camera had a little help. It appears at least half of these photos were processed with Snapseed and VSCO. local_offer    Pixel   Pixel XL   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (47) stars Further Reading New Google Live Cases available Google accounts suspended for reselling Pixel phones Pixel cases may cause camera issues Nexus 6P, Nexus 5X get Pixel nav bar The Verizon Pixel XL is delayed again stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertThis may be the Moto X 2017 closeHere’s our first look at the 2017 Moto X The Moto X 2017 may be alive and well as a new image has appeared which shows off the device’s metal body and camera cutout. 2 more_vertZTE wants to step up and fill the Nexus gap closeZTE wants to fill the gap left behind with the end of Nexus devices With the end of the Nexus line, there’s now a void in stock Android devices in the $400 range.

Google Evan Selleck Contributing Editor | October 4, 2016 142 shares 105 19 0 18 0 0 0 0 0               The Nexus brand is dead. Long live the Nexus idea. Today, Google took the stage and announced a few new products, and also revealed a few more details about things we already knew about. The company started things off with the new Pixel and Pixel XL, touting both as the first devices to come with Google Assistant built in. Assistant is going to be huge for Google, and, as such, the company is doubling down on its efforts to get the artificial intelligence platform onto as many devices as possible, and therefore more accessible. Assistant is available on the Pixel lineup, Google Home, and it will be arriving on other products as the months tick by. A lot has changed at Google, and continues to change, but there’s something that’s staying the same, in broad strokes: Nexus. Even if Google is dropping the brand, and has even gone as far as to say that the Nexus brand is effectively dead at this point, the ideas are still here. First, availability. We’ve seen the Nexus lineup come and go from carries, sometimes in a wide release, sometimes being available from only one, and sometimes just flat-out not being supported by others altogether. The Pixel lineup will continue that legacy with general availability through the Google Store, where pre-orders went live soon after the event closed shop. And then there’s the Verizon Wireless exclusivity. The Rumor Mill had made this an obvious announcement ahead of the big reveal, but I can say that I know quite a few people who were hoping that this wasn’t going to be the case. And even after Google made it official, there was some hope there that it would just be a timed exclusive. But, as it stands, that doesn’t appear to be the case. Google’s unlocked handsets will support other carriers, but for the folks who wanted to buy their Pixel or Pixel XL from a carrier, Verizon’s the only option. Which I can’t help but think is just the wrong way to go about this. The new Pixel phones are great – why limit their availability right out of the gate? This is probably because while the Pixel devices drop the Nexus brand, and Google is essentially done with it, the methodology is still there. The Pixel and Pixel XL, based on availability and launch, will probably not see a huge boost in attention, and they’ll probably be purchased by the majority of folks who would have bought a new Nexus smartphone this year, if Google had offered one. Pixel copies, or simply carries over, the strongest efforts from the Nexus lineup. The best possible specifications to show off the features of Android, like virtual reality, namely. These aren’t developer devices by any means, but the Nexus lineup hasn’t felt like that, not really, in a long time. But it also doesn’t put the Pixel or Pixel XL in the same category as the iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, or even other competing Android-based devices. Google doesn’t appear to be giving the best possible chance for the Pixel lineup to succeed, which is a real shame, because the new smartphones look pretty great. Google’s making it a bit easier with financing, and Google Fi, but for folks that are on T-Mobile, Sprint, AT&T, or any other carrier, buying an expensive smartphone from Google directly might not be the way they want to go. The Nexus lineup may have suffered from this same mentality, and here we are with a new brand and new devices, but treading the same water. Still, I can’t help but be curious. If you aren’t a Verizon customer, did you pre-order the Pixel or Pixel XL? And if you didn’t, why not? If you are a Verizon subscriber, did you pre-order Google’s new smartphone? Let me know!

The new phones represent a big, new push by Google to sell its own consumer devices, instead of largely just supplying software for other manufacturers. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg) SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Google is ratcheting up its rivalry with Apple and Amazon in unveiling new smartphones and an internet-connected speaker sporting a digital assistant that the company hopes to make indispensable. The devices unveiled Tuesday are part of Google’s bold move to design and sell its own hardware, instead of just supplying Android and other software for other companies to make products. Google’s previous attempts at hardware have had limited distribution and included such high-profile flops as its internet-connected Glass headgear. This time around, Google is betting big that it has matured to the point that it can design software and hardware to work seamlessly with each other — an art that Apple mastered during the past 15 years as it mesmerized consumers with its iPods, iPhones, iPads and Macs. Borrowing another page from Apple’s book, Google is backing its expanded product lineup with the biggest marketing campaign in its 18-year history. The company isn’t disclosing how much it will spend, but made it clear the ads touting products “Made by Google” will be ubiquitous during the next few months. “They have done some [auth] advertising in the past, but it’s never been with this kind of ‘let us take care of everything for you’ way,” Gartner analyst Brian Blau said. “This is more like Apple’s way of doing things.” GADGETS ON PARADE Google executives showed off a series of gadgets in rapid succession in San Francisco on Tuesday. The new Pixel phones, starting at a price of $650, are aimed squarely at Apple’s iPhone and could also siphon sales from the biggest manufacturer of Android-powered phones, Samsung. Android now powers more than 80 percent of the smartphones sold around the world. But Samsung has increasingly been adding more of its own software, including its own mobile wallet, on its phones. Analysts warned that Google’s increased emphasis on its own branded devices runs the risk of alienating Samsung, as well as LG and other longtime partners that make Android gadgets. Google, though, emphasized it still plans to work with other manufacturers, even as it tries to become a bigger player in hardware. Meanwhile, Google’s new Home speaker represents a counterpunch to Amazon’s Echo, a similar device that has become a big hit since its release about 15 months ago. Google Home will cost $129, undercutting Echo by $50. Home will be available on Nov. 4 for $129, with advance orders starting Tuesday. Google also announced a virtual-reality headset called Daydream View, a new Wi-Fi router and an update to the company’s Chromecast device for streaming video. THE PHONE Available in two sizes, the Pixel phones replace Google’s previous foray into smartphones with a Nexus brand introduced six years ago. Google never hailed Nexus as its own phone, but instead positioned it as an example of how it believed the Android system worked best. In promoting the Pixels, Google highlighted a camera it says trumps the latest iPhone, a long-lasting battery and a dedicated headphone jack — a staple that Apple eliminated from the iPhones released last month. And while past Google phones primarily relied on sales through Google’s online Play store, the Pixel will also be sold by Verizon in the U.S. The phones come out Oct. 20, with advance orders starting Tuesday. Analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy said in an email that Google was smart to emphasize the performance of the new smartphone cameras, as “consumers care about this a lot.” But he said other features in the new phones didn’t seem that much different from what Samsung and Apple have offered in their latest devices. SMART ASSISTANT The phones and speaker will serve as a showcase for Google’s digital helper, Google Assistant. The helper will respond to spoken questions such as “How do you remove wine stains out of the carpet?” and commands to control the volume of the television and other home appliances with internet connections. Google Assistant escalates the company’s battle against Apple, which offers a virtual helping hand through Siri, and Amazon, whose Alexa concierge resides in Echo and other devices. Google believes its assistant will be more knowledgeable, more personable and more versatile than the competition. Its confidence stems from the more than 70 billion facts that it has stockpiled in a database that it calls a “knowledge graph,” as well as the ability of its dominant search engine to quickly scan the web to retrieve a specific piece of information. Google CEO Sundar Pichai boasts that the assistant will draw upon the company’s advances in artificial intelligence to deliver “a personal Google for each and every user.” The artificial intelligence programming is designed to learn more about the person using it with each interaction, according to Google. That’s one reason why Google eventually wants the assistant on more devices, though the company currently doesn’t have plans to build directly into Android the way Siri is automatically included in Apple’s mobile software. Instead, Google will allow other device makers to include the assistant in their products if they want, beginning early next year. “Search has been Google’s golden ticket for the past 20 years of the internet, and now they are hoping artificial intelligence will become the next golden ticket,” Blau said. Still, while Google showed its new Assistant performing a variety of impressive tasks, Moorhead cautioned that similar services such as Siri and Microsoft’s Cortana haven’t fulfilled their early promises to ingrain themselves into people’s lives.

By Jacob Kleinman | October 4, 2016 Front Page /Mobile/Gallery/Lists/Opinion By Jacob Kleinman | October 4, 2016 Stay Connected with Us! Follow TechnoBuffalo Share Google’s Pixel and Pixel XL are now available for pre-order. Before you do, we’re here to help you understand five of the best reasons you might want to consider picking one of them up. Check out our rundown of the Pixel and Pixel XL’s top five features, along with a few other perks and disappointments. Google Assistant Google Assistant is coming to several of Google’s new products. It’s built into the company’s new chat app, Allo, and powers the upcoming Google Home smart speaker. But the Pixel and Pixel XL put Assistant in your pocket and make it available at a moment’s notice. Just hold down the home button or say “OK Google” to launch the AI assistant and start giving commands. Google Assistant can answer questions, check the weather or play a video. Assistant can even understand follow-up questions so you can carry out a more natural conversation, similar to what Siri offers. It also replaces the company’s old “Now on Tap” feature, bringing up relevant information on whatever you’re currently looking at as soon as it’s activated. Powerful Cameras The Pixel and Pixel XL both feature a 12.3-megapixel rear camera that scored an impressive 89 from DxOMark Mobile, making them the top-scoring mobile devices around. Google also included a “Smartburst” mode, which automatically shoots a bunch of photos in a row and picks the best one for you. It can capture 4K video at 30 frames per second, features digital image stabilization and promises high-quality lowlight shots. Up front, you’ll find a respectable 8-megapixel camera. Google didn’t offer many details on the secondary shooter, but it should be more than capable of producing solid selfies for sharing online. Unlimited High-Quality Storage Once you shoot all those great photos and videos you’ll want somewhere to store them (which might be an issue if you opt for the cheaper 32GB storage option). Thankfully, the Pixel and Pixel XL come with Google Photos pre-installed, which already offers free storage for compressed photos and videos. As an extra bonus, the company is throwing in unlimited original-quality storage. Normally, Google charges for high-quality storage once you run out of space. The cost can range from $2 per month for 100GB of space to $10 per month for one terabyte. You could end up saving anywhere from $24 to $120 per year depending on how many photos and videos you take.   Daydream Support The Pixel and Pixel XL are also the first phones officially approved to work with Daydream. Google’s new virtual reality platform offers a much more immersive experience than Cardboard, though it still can’t really compete with high-end headsets like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. Still, for just $79 the newly announced Daydream View will turn your Pixel smartphone into an impressive VR viewer.   24/7 Customer Service Google is throwing its full support behind the Pixel and Pixel XL and that won’t stop once you buy your phone. The company is offering non-stop customer support for anyone who picks up a device. That includes phone calls, text chat and screen sharing, making it possible for a Google employee to walk you through any issues from the comfort of your home. That kind of customer service isn’t exactly new. Amazon offers something similar with Mayday for its Fire tablets. Still, It’s nice to see Google promising great customer service for these new products, and it makes it a lot to recommend them to your less tech-savvy friends.   Wrap Up There are a few other nice perks included with the Pixel and Pixel XL. Fast charging is always great, though it’s not exactly unique at this point. Google’s new phones also offer high-end hardware across the board, including a Snapdragon 821 processor and 4GB of RAM, meaning they should hold up well over time. It’s not all good news, though. The Pixel and Pixel XL look pretty similar to Apple’s iPhones (especially from the front), which is a bit of a disappointment. The price is a little intimidating too (at least by Nexus standards), starting at $649 and going all the way up to $869. But if you don’t mind paying flagship prices, the Pixel looks like a great choice overall.

On Monday, David Foster became vice president of product engineering at Google. He will report to Rick Osterloh, the former Motorola executive who recently became responsible for overseeing Google’s hardware projects. Foster spent five years at Amazon. While there, he worked with the company’s secretive Lab126 hardware division, helping to lead development on Amazon’s lineup of Echo speakers, as well as the Kindle Paperwhite and Voyage. Last year, the division was hit with significant layoffs after the failure of the Amazon Fire phone. It’s not clear if Foster had any involvement in the development of the Pixel phones we’ll see Google unveil today. However, it’s almost certain he’ll play an enormous role in future devices, underlining the company’s concerted effort to become more of a hardware force. Prior to joining Amazon, Foster spent time at Microsoft, where he helped create the Zune HD. He also had a five year stint at Apple.

(John G Mabanglo/European Pressphoto Agency) Google's “hardware” push is still really about its software. On Tuesday, the technology giant unveiled a raft of new gizmos it proudly proclaimed to be #madebygoogle, including two smartphones and a smart home speaker. The message from Google is that it’s a new and gadgety dawn for the tech firm, which has floundered a bit in its hardware efforts. But based on what the company showed off today, Google still seems far behind despite earlier serious hardware efforts. It’s easier to think of the new gadgets as follow-ups to competitor products: a competitor for Apple’s iPhone and for Amazon’s Echo speaker. Yes, making products is hard; much harder, perhaps, than asking people to use your free websites or download your apps. So is it too late for Google on hardware? Why should it even bother, when the smartphone world, in particular, is so crowded already? It's true that even Google probably couldn’t just make an iPhone clone and expect instant success. But smartphones are evolving into something new. After years of trying to make phones that are the fastest, thinnest and lightest, companies now need to deliver something more to draw consumers to stores. Smartphones have essentially become a commodity, albeit a valuable one that acts as the central remote control for everything else in your life. Google discussed at length their shift towards creating hardware products in their Google Event held October 4. (Google) Google, in taking a leaf from Apple’s playbook to design both hardware and software from the ground up, gives itself a chance to break through in this second leg of the hardware relay race and lead the next one. And for Google, the it-factor in this race is its voice-activated Google Assistant. Listening between the lines of the prepared speeches Tuesday, it seems pretty clear that Google wants to make Assistant an essential in everyone’s life. Chief executive Sundar Pichai even said, explicitly, that he sees us moving from a mobile-first world to an AI-first world. [Google Assistant takes center stage at Google’s gadget event] In what was ostensibly a hardware event, the real promise of the presentations was one of a personalized Google that can answer questions about your life rather than a general query. Type “What am I doing next week?” into regular Google search, and you might get weekend productivity tips — but not information about your next work trip. Assistant, if Google pulls it off, should be able to crawl through your calendar and give you the answer that you really need. Its conversational tone should also be able to deliver the right information, no matter what words you use to ask. See the new specifications of Google Home, and all the things Google Assistant can help you do. (Google) That extends beyond what Amazon’s Alexa can offer — smart as it is, that voice assistant still answers queries based on the general Web more than on your personal digital information. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.) And Siri, while plugged into your calendar, often doesn’t understand what you’re asking. Plus, Assistant isn’t designed only for the smartphone. Google's decision to pair its Assistant-powered Home speaker with its Chromecast streaming dongles makes old tech new again, and responsive to voice commands for far cheaper than a new “smart” sound system or a smart TV. Assistant's many forms promises a low buy-in for homes to have the “Star Trek” computer — the voice-activated assistant — that we’ve always wanted. [Google Home wants to take over your home entertainment system] For consumers, an assistant plugged into the products we already use to run our lives is a big selling point. If Google offers nice hardware that really outshine others when it comes to integration with its popular software products — Mail, Maps, etc. — it could maybe pull a reverse-Apple and lead people to their hardware through their services. (Arguably, this could also be called pulling an Amazon.) In that sense, this hardware push isn’t about Google straying from its software roots, but rather making the right package for them. Will it succeed? That’s a difficult thing to say, of course. But going after both an aging, changing market in smartphones and the nascent smart home industry simultaneously is smart. That means you may come into the Googleverse through the Pixel phone, but you may also fall in love with the Home and then have that lead you to the phone. And it’s certainly true that one can lead from behind. Getting serious about a product late doesn’t necessarily mean getting counted out. Look at Apple and the iPad. Or Apple and the iPhone, for that matter. Google revealed their newly created-in-house phone, the Pixel. Take a look at its specs, Assistant, camera and more. (Google) Still, this is by no means a slam-dunk for Google. Looking at its much-anticipated Tuesday hardware event, the only thing that really stands out is still its software — which may raise questions about why they didn’t just release it as an app that works on all phones. But if Google can really make good, logical hardware, it stands a better chance than most at upending a hardware market that’s gotten a little stale. business technology the-switch true Please provide a valid email address.

Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via Pinterest Reza Estakhrian I had no idea what discount shopping was growing up. The phrase “shop 'til you drop” was my mantra. As a little girl, I enjoyed going to the mall more than a trip to the park. But as I matured, I quickly learned another saying: “Money doesn't grow on trees.” It was a tough wake-up call, but I discovered clever ways to indulge in shopping without shattering my budget. In fact, these hacks have saved me hundreds of dollars. And by following these simple steps, you can save major cash, too. Related: The Game-Changing Way to Shop For Workout Gear 1. Sign up for rewards programs. There are several brands that reward customers for consistent purchases. Sign up for the T.J. Maxx membership, and you'll be entered into sweepstakes and giveaway contests every time you buy. The DSW program sent me several $10 off coupons just for signing up. And there are a bunch of retailers that give birthday deals to loyal customers. 2. Buy off season. When temperatures start to change, retailers need to clear last season's items to make room for new pieces. This is the perfect time to take advantage of discounted styles. So, buy swimsuits at the beginning of fall, and shop for coats as the weather starts to heat up. 3. Search Google for discount codes. I will never (ever) complete an online purchase before doing a Google search for coupon codes. For example, I'll type "ASOS promo codes" into the Google search bar to see if there are any special discounts before I check out. Websites like Retail Me Not and Coupon Flow keep an index of offers to help you save big. 4. Create a separate email for deals. Promotional newsletters can easily crowd your inbox. If you're hoping to save big, you'll need a designated email account to collect as many coupons as possible. Then when you're ready to do some discount shopping, you can filter your inbox to find the retailer savings that are relevant. Related: 10 Affordable Beauty Products That Work Better Than The Luxe Alternatives 5. Use your student ID. If you’re a student, your ID can help you score discounts at places like Topshop. Banana Republic also has a deal that cuts prices for teachers and senior citizens. 6. Purchase gift cards at a lower price than face value. Gift Card Granny is one of my best-kept secrets. The website let's you buy gift cards for less than the actual value, and you can sell the cards you were gifted that you don't want. 7. Abandon shopping carts. Whenever I'm browsing on the internet, I always put my favorite items into the shopping cart—even if I’m not planning to purchase them. Some companies will encourage customers to complete the checkout process by sending an email with a discount. 8. Take advantage of price-drop alerts. I also like to bookmark items on my wish list on platforms like Pinterest, Polyvore, and Shopstyle. Each site has an alert feature that notifies me when prices are marked down. Related: Ashley Graham's Jean Shopping Tips Are Brilliant 9. Earn cash back with Ebates. You can actually make money from shopping with Ebates. It's really simple. Companies pay Ebates commission for sending you to their websites, and Ebates shares a portion of the payout with you. Then, you can get a check in the mail or a deposit to your PayPal account. There are more than 2,000 stores on the site, so finding something you love isn't a problem. 10. Open an incognito window to get introductory deals. Several companies lure in new customers with a percentage off of their first purchase. Try shopping some of your favorite retailers after clearing your browsing history or opening an incognito window. 11. Shop sample sales. Each season designers get rid of excess inventory by hosting sample sales. Sometimes pieces are slightly damaged, but they're certainly worth the steep discounts. Once I purchased a $1,000 vest for $20—a very proud moment. Visit Racked and Mizhattan to stay up-to-date on upcoming sales. And if you can't stand crowds, brands like Tibi host sample sales online. 12. And don't miss friends and family sales. These discounted events may seem exclusive, but most stores will honor price cuts for everyone. All you have to do is text the word 'JOIN' to 73277 to become a part of Sears' family. And Bloomingdales' online event is open to anyone who uses the promo code "FRIENDS" at checkout.

It doesn't mean they're "out of ideas" or "in a technological cul-de-sac" — or at least it doesn't necessarily mean that — it does mean they want to make money and keep users. It's actually one of my favorite elements of the tech industry. It's self-regulating in a small way, because there's a certain shame to, say, copying GoPro or Meerkat or Snapchat or Dropbox, but sometimes a product category or feature is just irresistible. At today's Pixel event, Google hit a lot of pre-existing categories and features with its own Google-branded hardware. And to clarify once more, because I don't want to be misunderstood: I'm not saying this is bad or dumb or unethical or boring, I'm just saying it's kind of obvious where the "inspiration" came from. 1. Google made an iPhone More specifically, Google made an iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus with the iPhone 7’s spec upgrades. The Pixel and Pixel XL are 5-inch and 5.5-inch, respectively. They're phones. They have visible antenna lines and brushed aluminum backs. They have headphone jacks. They aren't waterproof. You could probably call your loved ones on them! Obviously, when you're talking about slabs of glass, it's easy to say that they all look the same. Subjectively, I’d say there’s something sort of iPhone-ish to these two phones that I don’t see in, say, recent Nexus devices, or even the HTC 10. Maybe I'm just crazy. But aesthetics aside, Google was very clear that software / hardware integration is what’s key about Pixel. And software / hardware integration is Apple’s whole bit. 2. Google made a Gear VR It's become a bit of a high risk hobby in the Android world to ship your own VR headset with your latest flagship phone, but Samsung did it first and best by partnering with Oculus and shipping Gear VR in time crazy holiday sales last year. Google's launching Daydream View, the "Gear VR" in this equation, and also making the Daydream software and store, the "Oculus" in this equation. Daydream actually stands out from the competition for two reason: it will work with phones from any manufacturer that matches Google's spec (currently only the Pixel and Pixel XL are announced), and it comes with a really cool controller that mimics some of what you can do with a Vive or PlayStation VR controller. Oh, actually, three reasons: it looks like a really comfortable sweatshirt for your head. 3. Google made an Echo This is near the top of my "shameless" chart, mostly because Amazon's Echo speaker currently occupies a category of one. Echo is a voice-controlled speaker, and it's turned into an unlikely hit for a myriad of reason. Amazon's Alexa, the voice and brains of Echo, is a virtual assistant people don't hate. It's surprisingly nice to ask it to play music for you, or to set an alarm. The third party "skills" have breathed new life into the internet of things. Who would've thought a few years ago that the best way to turn your Philips Hue light bulbs on and off would be a talking cylinder? Google's new Google Home speaker is a slightly squashed Echo clone. It's $50 cheaper, and has Google Assistant for a brain. It plays YouTube Music. It comes with a YouTube Red subscription. Google's search prowess could make all the difference here, but conceptually and spiritually Google Home is an Echo. 4. Google made an Eero "I haven't heard of it so it doesn't count" won't work in a court of law, and it won't work here. Eero has a much lower profile than the rest of these products, but it's still a great idea whose time has come: mesh networking for consumers. Instead of relying on a single great Wi-Fi router, as Google has attempted with its OnHub partnerships, Eero spreads the load, and the coverage, over a number of Wi-Fi routers and simplifies the placement and setup of these routers through an app. Great idea, right? Google thought so. Google Wifi is basically an Eero, only for cheaper. It's $129 for a single Google Wifi, or $299 for a three pack. Eero is $199 for one and $499 for three. The big standout difference to my eyes is Google Wifi is a bit taller and more cylindrical than Eero, so I guess that's something. This is my number one shameless move, just because Amazon is a big boy and can take care of itself, Eero is a small upstart that will likely be entirely eclipsed by Google Wifi. 5. Google made a Chromecast (Honorable mention for not really copying anybody.) I just wanted to point out that while the original Chromecast wasn't exactly the first HDMI stick computer, it popularized the genre and remains hard to beat thanks to its integration with Chrome and a myriad of apps and media services. The new Chromecast Ultra does it all in 4K, and even adds an Ethernet port. So credit where credit's due.

REUTERS/Beck DiefenbachMore By Julia Love SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's Google on Tuesday announced a new "Pixel" smartphone and a suite of new consumer electronics products for the home, planting itself firmly in the hardware business and challenging Apple Inc's iPhone at the high end of the $400 billion global smartphone market. The string of announcements - including the $649 Pixel, a smart speaker for the living room dubbed "Home," a virtual reality headset, and a new Wi-Fi router - is the clearest sign yet that Google intends to compete head-to-head with Apple, Amazon.com Inc and even manufacturers of phones using its own Android mobile operating system. Company executives, echoing Apple's longstanding philosophy, said they were striving for tighter integration of hardware and software. "The thinking is that if we can work on hardware and software together, we can innovate much better," Google hardware chief Rick Osterloh said in an interview with Reuters, citing a recent reorganization that united once-disparate hardware teams. Under the new structure, the company has begun to take a much more integrated approach to things like supply chain management and design, added Mario Queiroz, a vice president of product management. "The learnings from one product are benefiting another product," he said. Unlike earlier Google phone efforts under the Nexus brand, the Pixel devices are designed and developed by Google from the start, although Taiwan's HTC Corp <2498.TW> will serve as the contract manufacturer. SWIPE AT APPLE Taking another page from the Apple playbook, Google said it would work exclusively with a single carrier in the United States, Verizon Communications Inc , on the Pixel, emulating Apple's agreement to launch the original iPhone with AT&T Inc . That deal gave Apple unprecedented control over the look of the phone and how it worked. Shares of Alphabet closed up 0.3 percent, while Verizon fell 1.2 percent. The phone comes in two sizes, and its high-end camera is one of few distinguishing features, analysts said. The phones come in black, blue and silver and will be able to get up to a seven-hour charge in 15 minutes. Pre-orders begin on Tuesday. "Aside from the camera, the new Google Pixels are pretty undifferentiated compared to Samsung and iPhone seventh generation phones," industry analyst Patrick Moorhead said. While the new phones are clearly aimed at competing with the iPhone - Google executives took several swipes at Apple in their on-stage remarks - analysts said Android rivals like Samsung Electronics <005930.KS> could be the biggest victim if the Pixel takes off. Google's strategy of licensing Android for free and profiting from embedded services such as search and maps made Android the dominant mobile operating system with some 89 percent of the global market, according to IDC. But Apple still rules the high end of the market, and Google has long been frustrated by the emergence of many variations of Android and the inconsistent experience that has produced. Pushing its own hardware will likely complicate its relationship with Android licensees, analysts said. ALL-PURPOSE ASSISTANT Google kicked off the event Tuesday by touting the Google Assistant, the company's voice-activated artificial intelligence system and its answer to Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa. The presenter showed how a customers could make a restaurant reservation with a few phrases spoken into the phone. The assistant will be embedded into the Pixel and Home products and is being positioned as the central feature in a family of integrated hardware and software products. It is one of a handful of similar assistants that are vying for supremacy as more people search the web and make purchases online using voice commands, which may eventually supplant keyboards and touchscreens as the primary means of controlling digital devices. While Google is often cited as the leader in artificial intelligence, Amazon stole a march on the company with its Alexa-powered Echo home speaker system, a surprise hit. The Home device and the Echo have many of the same features. Google's "Daydream View" virtual reality headset, meanwhile, puts the company in competition with Facebook Inc , owner of Oculus. The device, which works with an Android phone, is far cheaper and simpler. It will be available in November for $79, in time for the end-of-year shopping season. Home will also be available in November for $129, including a six-month trial of ad-free YouTube. Google also unveiled a new version of its Chromecast digital media player and a router dubbed Google Wifi, both boasting the same sleek, minimalist design as the Home product. "These look like products from a single company," said Queiroz, the Google executive.

Picking up where the Nexus handsets left off, the Pixel and Pixel XL are the first phones to be made by Google "inside and out" - meaning that Google has masterminded the hardware as well as the software. They are also the first phones to ship with Google's newest operating system, Android 7.1 Nougat, and offer the "cleanest" Android experience you are likely to get on a smartphone. Design Google has opted for an industrial design, with an aerospace-grade aluminum body and Corning Gorilla Glass 4 screen. The Google Pixel phone is displayed during the presentation of new Google hardware in San Francisco (Photo: REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach) The Pixel has a 5-inch display, while the Pixel XL's display is 5.5-inches. A thin bezel gives both phones a near edge-to-edge display. Like the Nexus 5X and 6P that came before it, the Pixel has a fingerprint sensor on the back, putting it in easy reach when you're holding the phone in one hand. The fingerprint reader is not only used to unlock the phone but also to access and scroll through notifications by swiping from top to bottom. Read More Google Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones finally revealed - can they compete with the iPhone 7? Google made a point of saying that, unlike the iPhone 7, there is "no unsightly camera bump" on the back of the Pixel. This, together with the unbroken sheet of glass covering the front of the device give it a minimalist appearance. The Google Pixel phone is used by a member of the media during the presentation of new Google hardware in San Francisco (Photo: REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach) However, its sculpted surfaces and rounded edges leave you in no doubt that it is a premium device and a worthy competitor to the iPhone 7. Sadly, in the UK, it is only available in two colours - "quite black" and "very silver", with the "really blue" option reserved for the American market. Camera The Pixel has a 12.3-megapixel camera, featuring an f/2.0 aperture and big 1.55 micron pixels to capture lots of light. While those specs may not sound all that impressive on paper, the Pixel's camera has been given a score of 89 by DxOMark - the industry standard for camera and lens image quality - making it the highest-rated smartphone camera ever tested. Read More Google announces Daydream VR headset - and it will be available in early November The camera app offers a number of clever features like "Smartburst", which takes a rapid-fire sequence of shots and automatically selects the best ones, and "Lens Blur" to achieve shallow depth of field and bokeh effects, (see video above). Brian Rakowski, Google vice president of product management, talks about the camera in the new Google Pixel phone (Photo: AP Photo/Eric Risberg) You can also switch between the rear camera and selfie mode with a double flick of the wrist. While it was hard to judge the camera's prowess with the limited time I had with the Pixel, it succeeded in creating a bokeh effect, where an object in the foreground was in focus and the background blurred. It was also did a good job of capturing details of my face and clothes in low lighting conditions.

Google Pixel vs OnePlus 3 Google Pixel latest news Google Assistant Pixel comes with Google Assistant built in, so like with Apple's Siri, you can ask it a question by saying "OK Google" or holding down the Home button. The new Google Pixel phone is displayed following a product event (Photo: AP Photo/Eric Risberg) Google Assistant is more advanced than Siri in some ways, allowing you to have a natural two-way conversation. For example, you can say, “OK Google, where is the nearest cafe? And then tap the mic icon and follow up with "Remind me to leave for coffee with Jamie at 7am". Read More Google Home is the voice-controlled gadget that wants to take over your house Assistant can also offer help with what’s on-screen in any app. So if your friend texts you to meet up at a new restaurant, you can just say "navigate there". As is so often the case with these kinds of things, working out how to phrase questions to get the information you want is a bit of a learning curve, but in my brief tests Assistant seemed very responsive. Members of the media examine Google's Pixel phone during an event to introduce Google hardware products (Photo: Getty Images) Other features The Pixel phones come with Google's newest apps Allo and Duo pre-installed so you can video call and text with all your friends, whether they're on Android or iOS. They also come with quick charging technology, so you can get up to 7 hours of battery life with just 15 minutes of charging. Read More How much will the Google Pixel and Pixel XL phones cost? Best UK deals and where to find them However, perhaps the best perk for Pixel owners is free unlimited online storage, meaning you can save all your photos and video in their original quality and full resolution in Google Photos. For anyone who struggles to backup the contents of their smartphone due to lack of storage space, or constantly finds themselves deleting photos and videos to free up space, this could prove to be a killer feature. Price and release date The Pixel costs £599 for the 32GB version and £699 for the 128GB version, and the Pixel XL costs £719 for the 32 GB and £819 for the 128GB version. That puts Google's smartphones exactly on a par with Apple's equivalent iPhone 7 and 7 Plus models. The Pixel and Pixel XL can be pre-ordered from today, and will start shipping on October 20. They will be available to purchase from the Google Store, EE and Carphone Warehouse. First impressions Google's new Pixel smartphones are attractive, minimalist, and smarter than most, thanks to tight integration with the search engine and some of its most innovative apps. They offer an attractive proposition to anyone looking for a pure Android experience, unadulterated by the bloatware that so many manufacturers choose to pile on top of the operating system. Read More Google Pixel XL vs iPhone 7 Plus - which smartphone will win when Google takes on Apple? Their impressive cameras and generous storage offerings are also likely to prove enticing to many. Of course, premium features don't come cheap. The question is whether Nexus customers, who are used to Google undercutting its rival Apple, will be willing to pay top dollar for the new Pixel devices. poll loading Will Google's Pixel phones be popular? 0+ VOTES SO FAR YES NO Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Daily Newsletter Follow @MirrorTech Subscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribe Comments Show more comments More On Google Android Apps Pixel Mobile phones Smartphones tech all Most Read Most Recent NintendoNintendo Mini NES Classic Edition: Release date, price, games and how to pre-order Mario's nostalgic new console Nintendo is going back to the glory days with this brand new version of the classic NES console - here's everything you need to know about it TechnologyNintendo Switch UK price LEAKED - and Mario's next console looks surprisingly affordable High street retailer GAME is reported to be setting the next generation console's price at a wallet-friendly price iPhone rumoursiPhone 8: Release date, price, rumours and news about Apple's 2017 iPhone Apple has only just launched its iPhone 7, but many eyes are already turning to next year's model, the iPhone 8, which is expected to be Apple's biggest launch in years TechnologyThis simple trick will let you screenshot a Snapchat message without notifying the sender If you want to screenshot a Snapchat message without the sender knowing, all you need is this simple trick Video GamesThe 'most wanted' PlayStation 4 feature could be about to happen Sony is rumoured to be working on an update that would deal with one the most common frustrations from PS4 gamers ThreeThree Mobile suffers cyber attack 'leaving personal data of SIX MILLION customers at risk' Crooks accessed phone giant's upgrade system to order hundreds of high-value handsets using an employee login Virtual realityGoogle Earth VR lets you go anywhere on the planet without leaving the house The search giant has released a virtual reality version of Google Earth with guided tours of famous landmarks MarsMars space suit concept revealed as scientists discover potential hotbed of alien life on Red Planet A new concept has been unveiled for a space suit able to withstand the harsh conditions on Mars CarsRevolutionary new WATERLESS car wash cleans and waxes - even when there's a hosepipe ban The amazing system saves around 480 litres of water per wash and does away with pressure washers NintendoNintendo Mini NES Classic Edition: Release date, price, games and how to pre-order Mario's nostalgic new console Nintendo is going back to the glory days with this brand new version of the classic NES console - here's everything you need to know about it Most Read Most Recent TeenagersTragic British girl, 14, to be cryogenically frozen so she might live again after historic court victory The youngster knew she only had weeks to live when she wrote a heartbreaking letter to a judge asking to be frozen until a cure could be found TV NewsI'm a Celeb's Scarlett Moffatt is battling facial paralysis in the jungle as she's ruled out of Bushtucker Trial The Gogglebox favourite, 25, was diagnosed with Bell’s palsy after being knocked over by a car when she was 11 ChocolateStill angry about Toblerone?

OSNews Forgot Password · Register Login to OSNews Username or EmailPassword Search OSNews Advanced Search Submit News RSS Home Originals News Archive Shopping Topics FAQs Contact Advertise Google unveils Pixel, Google Home, more posted by Thom Holwerda on Tue 4th Oct 2016 20:23 UTC Google unveiled a whole slew of new hardware products today, most notably its Pixel phones. You already know all the specifications and how it looks, so I won't bore you with the specifications details. Two good points about the Pixel phones: they come with easy on-device access to 24/7 phone and chat support with real Google people (...but what if it doesn't boot?), and it has a supposedly really great camera with no bump. The bad news about the Pixel? The pricing. Oh boy the pricing. The small Pixel costs a whopping €759, the bigger Pixel costs €869 (German pricing). That's absolutely crazytown, and I simply don't know if the Google brand has what it takes, hardware-wise, to go toe-to-toe with Samsung and Apple. More bad news: it's barely available anywhere. It's only available in the few markets where iOS is really strong (US, UK, Canada, Australia), and Germany, but nowhere else. Not in the rest of mainland Europe (an Android stronghold), not in Japan, not in China, not in South America (another Android stronghold). As a Dutch person, this is especially grating because virtually all of these goods are shipped to Europe from the port of Rotterdam, where they lie in warehouses before being shipped off. But not to The Netherlands. Anyhow, I just find it perplexing that in 2016, product launches are still nation state-restricted. Honestly though, I like the Pixel phones. I was a little apprehensive when looking at the leaks, but with the higher-quality announcements, product videos, and hands-on photos and videos coming out, it's starting to grow on me. I definitely would have liked a more outspoken design, but then I remember that the best modern smartphone I've ever had was my beloved, cherished Nexus 5 - not exactly a beacon of extravagance - which just feels great in the hand, mostly thanks to the excellent type of plastic used on the orange-red model I have, but also thanks to its unassuming, generic shape. Maybe I don't know what I want. I deeply dislike the design of my pink iPhone 6S (except for the pink, of course, that's still awesome), but at the same time, it feels pretty great in the hand, so I can't really fault Apple or Google or Samsung sticking to the generic, default shape we've settled on. The same applies to my current phone - a Nexus 6P - which is a pretty 'safe' design, too. Google also unveiled - again - Google Home, its Alexa competitor, and an updated version of ChromeCast, which can now stream 4K video. They also demonstrated the first Daydream VR headset, which uses a Google Pixel - or any other future Daydream-compatible Android phone - as its display. Tying all of these devices together is Google Assistant, a souped-up Google Now with a conversational interface. It's difficult to say how useful Google Assistant will be beyond the staged demos. Like the Pixel, these devices are only available to a very small group of people - the US, mostly - save for the new ChromeCast. So, why is Google getting into the hardware game for real this time? That's why today Google is unveiling an entire, interconnected hardware ecosystem: two phones, an intelligent speaker, a VR headset, a Wi-Fi router, and a media-streaming dongle. And the most important parts of that ecosystem - the Pixel phone and Google Home speaker - exist to be the ideal vessels for the Google Assistant. The rest of the products fill out Google's ecosystem, but are also enhanced by Google's cloud-based intelligence. In making its own hardware, Google is pitting itself against Apple for the first time, Google phone vs. iPhone. Those are very high stakes, with very little margin for error. So it looks like Google decided to follow a simple dictum: If you want something done right, you have to do it yourself. I'd like to add something to that dictum: you have to make sure people can actually buy your stuff. Google has a lot of work to do on that one.

Google’s Pixel phones represent the very best of Android with solid specs and sharp software. Google’s poorly-kept secret, the Pixel and Pixel XL, are here. The pair are the first smartphones to be marketed as “made by Google,” which feels a little misleading considering HTC is still the manufacturer. Google announced the Pixel and Pixel XL at a heavily-advertised event in San Francisco. The company unveiled several hardware products, including Google Home, Daydream View, and Chromecast Ultra. The design and software of the Pixel smartphones are the first to be made from the ground up by Google. The push by the search giant to market and price these devices as competitors to the reigning mobile champions — Apple and Samsung — is exciting. Let’s take a brief look at the Pixel and Pixel XL, and how they stack up. iPhone, by Google The all-aluminum Pixel and Pixel XL are identical to each other in the looks department — the name suggests the primary difference between the two. The Pixel has a 5-inch screen with a resolution of 1,920 x 1,080 pixels. The XL features a 5.5-inch screen, and a resolution of 2,560 x 1,440-pixels takes advantage of the larger screen real estate. The front of both devices resembles the iPhone 7. The bezels seem larger in pictures than they are — we didn’t have much an issue with them. You’ll find the 8-megapixel selfie camera on the front, along with a power button on the right edge and a volume rocker below it. The headphone jack is on the top of the phone, and the speakers are at the bottom like they are on the iPhone 7 and its predecessors. The back of the Pixel phones are a little more interesting. They feature a half-glass back, which houses a large fingerprint sensor, a camera, an LED flash, and a few other sensors. There’s an antenna band at the bottom, sides, and top edges. The back still looks like an iPhone as well, but it’s not a bad thing. The Pixel devices stand out enough to be noticeable, and we think the phones look good. Related: Google’s Pixel phones bring fast charging, AI, VR, a cam to rival the iPhone’s The Pixels feel great in the hand — high-end, not too heavy, and they don’t seem fragile, even with the half-glass back. They come in three color options: really blue, quite black, and very silver. Yes, those are the actual names. We’re partial to the blue, though it’s too bad it only comes with a white front. The black is a solid alternative, but the white doesn’t look great. The blue variant is limited to the U.S. High-end specs Google’s Pixel smartphones are the first devices in the U.S. to be powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 821 processor, which reportedly sees a 10 percent performance increase over the Snapdragon 820. The 820 is Qualcomm’s chip that powers several 2016 flagship smartphones such as the LG G5, Samsung’s Galaxy S7 Edge, the OnePlus 3, and more. Android manufacturers often downgrade the specifications of smaller devices, and Google is guilty of this too when looking at the Nexus 5X and the Nexus 6P. That’s not an issue with the Pixel and the Pixel XL. Finally, Android fans who like smaller phones have an excellent device they can buy without compromising on the specs. Google Pixel phoneMore Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Both have 4GB of RAM, Gorilla Glass 4, fingerprint sensors, USB Type-C ports, and storage options between 32GB and 128GB. The only other difference here is the battery — the larger phone has a 3,450mAh battery, and the regular Pixel has one with a 2,770mAh capacity.

In our brief time with the phones, they had no hiccups opening a slew of apps, moving between them, and triggering Assistant. Promising cameras Specs aren’t everything. One thing most buyers look at is a smartphone’s camera. Samsung and Apple have dominated this space, and there are several worthy contenders as well. Google’s Nexus smartphones and the pre-installed Google Camera software have never been able to keep up, though the Nexus 6P came close. But cameras are a strong focus for the Pixel phones. The rear camera has 12.3-megapixels and does not have optical image stabilization. Instead, they use Google’s proprietary gyroscope-based stabilization system for filming videos. It reads data from the gyro 200 times a second, meaning videos will be smoother and shake-free. The front camera has 8-megapixels. According to DXOMark, Google’s Pixel phones scored an 89 — the highest mark for any smartphone camera to date. That’s thanks to the size of the pixels — 1.55-micron pixels, and Google’s HDR+ upgrades. HDR+ is on for all photographs taken with the Pixel — it captures several RAW images to produce a JPEG image with minimal blur, noise, and improved dynamic range. Google says capture time is the fastest it has seen compared to other devices the company tested with, and HDR+ is processed incredibly quickly. Related: Everything you need to know about Google Assistant We saw that in action first hand while playing around with the camera. Snapping photos was quick and instantaneous, and so was processing. We had to wait a few seconds when we captured photos in a speedy succession, but it was still much faster than we have experienced on the Nexus 6P and the Nexus 5X. We were also shooting in a low-light environment, and the Pixels seemed to handle the photos pretty well with minimal noise and grain. Google Pixel phoneMore Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends What’s neat is that if you’re a Pixel owner, you’ll get free, unlimited storage space in Google Photos for your photographs in their full resolution, so you don’t have to worry about storage. We’ll have to test these cameras out thoroughly before we can pass final judgment, but from what we’ve seen Google may have a winner of a camera on its hands. Assistant and Android 7.1 The Pixel smartphones are well ahead of Android 7.0 Nougat — they ship with the next best thing, Android 7.1 Nougat. The notification drawer is black, and the brightness slider is blue. The Settings menu also has some slight cosmetic changes to match the Pixel theme. The navigation buttons are filled in white now, and the middle home button has an outline. Pressing and holding the home button activates Google Assistant. It’s a voice search function that allows you to ask Google’s artificially-intelligent bot for help — ranging from search queries, booking a restaurant, to ordering an Uber. More third-party integrations will be on the way. Triggering Assistant when you’re in another app, like a conversation with a friend, will have it read the messages to offer relevant information. This is the same thing Google Now on Tap does, except it’s essentially rebranded to Assistant and is more personalized. The Pixel smartphones come with a Pixel Launcher, which is similar to the Google Now Launcher. Swipe right and you’ll find yourself at Google Now. The main difference is the date at the top right, and the Google tab on the top left, which directs you to a standard Google search. Related: Everything you need to know about Android 7.1 Nougat and the Pixel Launcher There’s also no app drawer icon — swipe up from the bottom to access the app drawer, where you can search for apps as well. The Pixel phones will also feature an integration with Google’s live support team — from the Settings menu, swap to the Support tab to chat or talk to the team about any issues you have with the device. You can share your screen too, in case the support representative needs to take a look at your device. It’s a great feature for customers and it elevates support for Pixel phones well above most other Android phones. A Google spokesperson said Assistant will only remain on the Pixel and Google Home for now. There are no plans for a future Nexus smartphone, and the company is exploring ways to bring Assistant to other Android devices. That doesn’t mean Android 7.1 Nougat isn’t coming to other Android phones. The new version brings Launcher Shortcuts, which are almost identical to 3D Touch on iOS. Tap and hold an icon to open a pop-up box with quick actions, like “Compose an email” for Gmail. It’s unfortunate that Assistant isn’t going to come to previous Nexus devices for now, and that several features are Pixel-exclusive. Android 7.1 will look much sleeker on a Pixel phone than on a Nexus, for example. Still, what we’ve seen so far is a promising start to the Pixel line. Availability and price The Pixel and the Pixel XL are available for pre-order now and will ship toward the end of the month. The Pixel will cost $650 for the 32GB variant or $27.04 a month for 24 months via Google’s device financing program. The 128GB model costs $750. The Pixel XL costs $770 for the 32GB storage option or $32.04 a month for 24 months on Google’s device financing program. The 128GB model costs $870. If you pre-order a Pixel smartphone, you’ll get a Daydream View headset for free. It costs $80 separately. These devices are unlocked from Google, meaning you can use them on various carrier networks. For Verizon, however, Google is following Motorola with carrier exclusivity — you’ll only see Pixel phones sold in Verizon stores. The prices for the Pixel and Pixel XL on Verizon mostly match Google’s. Unfortunately, the price may kill these smartphones. While they offer fantastic specs and promise great cameras, they do lack a “wow” factor and a few features you’ll find on competitors like the iPhone 7 and the Galaxy S7 Edge, such as water-resistance. There are also other smartphones that have similar specs with a much lower price tag, like the OnePlus 3 and ZTE’s Axon 7. It’s going to be tough for people to jump into the high-end smartphone market, especially when it’s the mid-range one that’s booming. Highs: Hardware and software optimized by Google High-end specs mean snappy performance Speedy photo capture and solid low-light images Assistant integration is quick and accurate Size difference doesn’t mean a sacrifice in performance Lows: No water resistance High price tag compared to similar specs on other phones 4GB of RAM, not 6GB like other competitors Carrier exclusive to Verizon After Pixel unveiling, Google puts its Nexus program on indefinite hiatus Google’s Pixel phones bring fast charging, AI, VR, a cam to rival the iPhone’s Everything you need to know about Android 7.1 Nougat and the Pixel Launcher Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next Best Buy’s pre-Black Friday 2016 sale is live right now – here are the 20 best deals BGR News iOS 10 Hidden Feature: The Magnifier Yahoo Tech China astronauts return from monthlong space station stay Associated Press New hybrid console takes Nintendo on the go Yahoo Tech AirSelfie drone is small enough to stow away in a phone case Digital Trends This smart crib will help your baby sleep safely through the night Yahoo Tech Russia has now officially blocked LinkedIn BGR News Privacy |Terms |About our Ads |Suggestions Brought to you by Yahoo News Network

Ask for a recipe while in your kitchen, ask for the latest sports scores while in your living room, or ask for current traffic conditions as you get ready for work in the morning. With the simple command of “OK Google”, you can ask Google Home to perform any tasks that Google Search is capable of doing. Google Home can answer questions, convert currency, look up weather conditions, read you the daily news, and more — all in real time. Connecting Google Home with your personal Google account creates even more options. For example, with the command “OK Google, tell me about my day”, Google Home will tap into your calendar and read off your schedule. The hardware itself has been designed to blend in seamlessly with one’s home, featuring a clean and minimal design. No buttons, no LED lights, just a capacitive touch surface on top and the speaker grill on the bottom. Since every home has a different interior design, Google Home can be customized to match its surroundings. A Virtual Assistant with Personality This may sound like a very mechanical experience, but Google Home is not necessarily all business. Like Siri, Cortana, and Alexa — Google Assistant has been developed with a personality and a female persona. You can have conversations and/or joke around with Google Assistant, and it will respond back in its own unique way. You can see an example of Google Assistant’s personality in the company’s new Google Allo messaging app. Pricing and Availability Google Home will be available to purchase in November, with preorders having already begun. It will retail for a price of $129 and can be bought from the Google Store, as well as major retailers such as Best Buy, Target, and Walmart.

Image Credit: Reuters Sabrina Ellis, Director of Product Management at Google, speaks about the new Pixel phone October 4, 2016. Image Credit: Reuters‹› Published: 21:32 October 4, 2016 Bloomberg   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE San Francisco: Google is embarking on a wholesale revamp of its mobile phone strategy, debuting a pair of slick and powerful handsets that for the first time will go head-to-head with Apple Inc.’s iconic iPhone. Alphabet Inc.’s Google on Tuesday unveiled the Pixel and l arger Pixel XL, the first phones that were conceptualized, designed, engineered and tested in-house. The Pixel handsets feature a Siri-like virtual assistant, flashy camera features and are the first to boast Android’s new Nougat 7.1 operating system. Their debut signals Google’s push into the $400 billion smartphone hardware business and shows that the company is willing to risk alienating partners like Samsung Electronics Co. and LG Electronics Inc. that sell Android-based phones. “Google is now the seller of record of this phone,” said Rick Osterloh, chief of the company’s new hardware division. He notes that the company is now managing inventory, building relationships with carriers, sourcing components, making supply chain deals and managing distribution. Google is even making accessories, including cases and cables. Until now, Google had satisfied itself with dipping a toe into the smartphone hardware business with the six-year-old Nexus program, a co-branding effort that outsourced the vast majority of development to other smartphone makers. While well regarded, Nexus handsets were mostly a way for Google to experiment. But along the way, executives began to see the benefit of the Apple approach: a unified portfolio of consumer electronics products - phones, tablets, watches, computers - that lock users into its services. Getting into the smartphone hardware business is a big, risky financial and operational commitment. But Google needed its own handset to ensure distribution for its web services, and more complex offerings like virtual and augmented reality. So in the summer of 2015, Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai approved the Pixel project; development began last fall. “The difference with this device is that we started from the beginning,” says Dave Burke, who runs Android engineering. By contrast, Google’s contributions to Nexus phones typically didn’t happen until they were 90 percent done. Custom Silicon When Osterloh, 44, came on board in mid-April, he brought Google’s hardware groups into one division, shuttering projects he didn’t see contributing to Google’s future. Now the engineers and designers from Google Glass, Chromecast and Pixel all work together. Keeping them separate, he says, made it “hard to drive toward the goal of portfolio strategy and focus.” Reflecting long-held ambitions to build an Apple-style supply chain, the hardware division now has a supply-management team, drawing on the expertise of the Nest smart-home unit acquired by Google nearly three years ago. Google declined to say how much it’s spending on the effort. However, Jason Bremner, a former Qualcomm Inc. executive who works on Google’s hardware products, put it in context. “Part of being the seller of record means that inventory, that supply chain risk - you know, hundreds of millions of dollars on the line on any given day - that’s on Google now,” he said. Now that Google is designing phones itself, the company can at long last put together a product roadmap going out several years. For example, last month Burke was able to see a photo taken by a Google handset that won’t debut until next fall. That “would have never happened with Nexus,” he says. Going forward, more and more of the phones’ guts will be developed in-house. Burke says the company will eventually be able to ship its own custom “silicon,” a buzzword for customized processors that make devices work better. It’s a very different setup from Osterloh’s previous Google gig, when he ran the Motorola division. “While we were part of Google, we were very arm’s-length,” he says. Now his team gets early access to the company’s advances in machine learning and innovations from the Assistant group. The Pixel phones will also be the first to run the next version of Android, Nougat 7.1, complete with Google tie-ins like pro camera effects, instant chat support, and a service that automatically frees up phone storage via the cloud. Still, Google has deliberately built a firewall between the hardware and Android divisions so other phone makers’ proprietary technology doesn’t leak. Hiroshi Lockheimer, who runs the Android unit and is a longtime Osterloh pal, says his group will treat the hardware team like any customer. “Samsung is a very important partner, as is LG, Huawei and so on,” he says. “Rick is an important partner. Samsung tells us confidential information about their product line, their plans. We won’t tell LG that, and vice versa. That continues. Everyone is treated the same, including Rick’s team.” Osterloh Show When Osterloh demonstrated the Pixel phones at Google’s Mountain View, California, headquarters recently, it was immediately clear the craftsmanship is light years ahead of the flimsy $1,500 Google Glass headsets and plastic Chromecast media players of yore. With their metal frames and precisely honed bezels and edges, the Pixels (which come in silver, black and limited-edition blue) have more in common with the elegant gear from Nest. The phones feature cameras that can snap photos quicker than the blink of an eye, app speeds once reserved for laptops and battery life that bests last year’s non-Google made Nexus phones. Osterloh proudly showed how one can twist the phone mid-air to activate the selfie-camera. “That’s pretty cool,” he says. Also notable is a fingerprint scanner that doubles as a trackpad (other Android phone makers will get to enable this, too) and software-enhanced gyroscopes that reduce shakiness in recorded video, stabilization that Osterloh calls “out of this world good.” The new phones are made up of off-the-shelf components from several suppliers, including a Snapdragon processor, and are assembled in Taiwan by HTC. But there is still custom work inside this first version, including wireless modem technology that has evolved from earlier experiments with Nexus. The Pixel also has chipsets optimized by Google that makes photo-taking and touchscreen response times much faster than any Android device yet built, Burke says. The Google Assistant was developed separately from Android and offers suggestions based on previous queries. For example, it can list San Francisco landmarks after being asked earlier about the local weather. While Google has contracted HTC to assemble the Pixel phones, Osterloh says the approach is no different than Apple’s partnership with iPhone builder Foxconn. Flip the Pixel over and you’ll see “Made by Google,” another tip of the hat to Apple, which has long made much of the fact that its phones are “Designed by Apple in California.” Osterloh says Google will never say the Pixel is co-engineered with anyone else. He proudly proclaims, “It’s ours.” More from Technology Tesla’s move beyond cars official 04:13 pm Airbnb launches new 'Trips' service 06:08 am ONEm offers new business model Facebook buys facial recognition tech start-up Is Moto Z the next innovation in smartphones?

The freedom is — hold on, my show is buffering — truly liberating. (So long as I don’t put my iPad next to my refrigerator. Then it’s infuriating.) While unveiling the newest version of his company’s streaming media box just over a year ago, Apple CEO Tim Cook proclaimed “the future of TV is apps.” Today, Google revealed its competing vision for the big screen and, unsurprisingly, the two rivals are at odds with one another. The search giant thinks the future of TV is bandwidth, and from my Barcalounger — situated on the cutting edge of technology — I’m compelled to agree. I’ve had the latest Apple TV for nearly a year, but I’ve only used it about a dozen times. Apps — at least in their current configuration — aren’t the future of television, at least not right now. In part, that’s because, while using the Apple TV, you have to use your television provider credentials to log into each and every different app. This is a major pain. Apple says a fix is coming, but it’s still MIA. Another Apple TV hangup for some: It doesn’t support 4K video. What’s the sense of buying a shiny new box for your shiny new television if it will provide a picture that’s no better than your old flatscreen? A year ago, this was a three-way chicken and egg problem between studios that didn’t shoot shows and movies in 4K, Internet providers that didn’t provide enough bandwidth to handle large video files, and television manufacturers that struggled to get pricing low enough for mass adoption. But coming into this holiday season, 4K televisions will be in demand, 4K content will be more widely available through providers like Netflix and Google Play, and ISPs…well, Internet speeds are still a challenge. So instead of using the Apple TV, I use TiVo. It’s a great service presumably only used by journalists and Europeans, because those are the only people I ever hear speaking lovingly about the company. Through my TiVo box and accompanying app, I can stream video to my iPad or iPhone whether I’m home or not. That said, it works much better in my home than outside it, and struggles in low-bandwidth situations like on public Wi-Fi or, as I alluded, next to my refrigerator. (The same can be said for any other streaming video app like Amazon Prime, Hulu, Netflix, and the rest.) But the fact is, my home’s Internet setup wasn’t designed to let me watch Last Week Tonight via HBO Go on my iPad while I wash the dishes. The refrigerator, my body, and the running water all block my wireless signal as I scrub the pots and pans. As a busy father, the 20 minutes I get cleaning up dinner are the few moments in a day I get all to myself — and even then I end up troubleshooting the house’s Internet problems. One of Google’s new products, announced at its event Tuesday, might help: Google Wi-Fi. Due to launch in December, Google Wi-Fi aims to eschew the central router concept in favor of an expandable system that improves coverage throughout the house. “Unfortunately, traditional routers weren’t designed for the way we use Wi-Fi in the home today,” Google Head of Product Management Mario Queiroz said while unveiling the gadget. “We’re streaming, gaming, video chatting and more, all throughout the house.” By plugging in multiple Google Wi-Fi routers, which will cost $129 for one or $299 for three but are not yet ready for pre-order, the system creates a Wi-Fi network around the home that’s supposed to keep far-flung devices like my nursery webcam and my front door camera transmitting data just as quickly as my living room’s Apple TV can gobble it up. But Google would prefer I use a new $69 Chromecast Ultra instead. The company is making a strong case for me (and anyone who owns a 4K television) to switch. Similar to the 30 million other Chromecast devices Google has sold to date, the new version will be capable of streaming ultra-high definition 4K content, at last taking advantage of all those gorgeous new televisions that everyone’s been neglecting. And pairing Google Play’s upcoming 4K content offerings with equally high resolution images on YouTube, the chicken and egg problem is no more. Suddenly all of Google’s eggs are hatching. Well, almost. The company still has to contend with ISPs and slow broadband speeds. But through Google Fiber, the company is conquering that, albeit slowly. Of course, my city doesn’t have Google Fiber and, most likely, neither does yours. But faster Internet speeds are coming. And the future of television with it. Read Next Your browser is out of date.

 Google is going to win the next major battle in computing Steve Kovach Oct. 4, 2016, 5:46 PM 77,305 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google CEO Sundar Pichai at Tuesday's event. AP Over four years ago, Google launched a bold evolution of search called Google Now. Google Now wasn’t the search you were used to. Instead of a list of results to your queries, you got the single answer you were looking for. How old is Barack Obama? What time is the Super Bowl? When was the last time the Mets won the World Series? You always got the answer. And even better, Google Now was proactive, bringing you the information you wanted before you even knew you wanted it. Your flight is delayed. Traffic is bad, so you’d better leave a few minutes early if you want to make it to work on time. Your favorite team lost again. Google Now felt like the future at a time when Apple was still trying to get Siri to understand you when you asked it 2+2. On Tuesday, Google kicked it into high gear. At its big product launch event, Google Now officially became super-charged with Google Assistant, the next evolution of its AI. We got an early look at Assistant in Allo, Google’s new messaging app that launched a few weeks ago, but Tuesday’s event showed us Google’s true vision for its new AI helper. Assistant will be everywhere, helping you out no matter what gadget or app you’re using. And according to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, it’ll keep getting smarter the more you use it, to the point that it’ll be so customized to the user that there will be a unique Google Assistant for everyone. It may not be a new idea — all the major tech companies from Microsoft to Amazon to Facebook have their own AI assistants — but it is a category Google is uniquely qualified to dominate. Google Assistant in the Allo chat app. Skye Gould/Business Insider After all these years, Google continues to embarrass the competition. While Assistant can tap into the world’s knowledge, Siri struggles to answer even the simplest queries. I recently asked both AIs when Tuesday’s vice presidential debates start. Google Assistant told me 9 p.m. Eastern. Siri gave me a list of search results about the election from Bing. That’s just one example, but if you use Google Assistant often enough, you realize just how far ahead it is. Then there’s the new Google Home speaker, a competitor to Amazon’s surprise hit Echo speaker. While the Echo is a great device, Google’s demo of Home already felt ahead of what Amazon has pulled off so far. Of course, it can play music and control smart appliances. But it also intelligently answers questions better than Amazon’s Alexa. And overall, Echo can’t do half of the things we saw Home do on Tuesday. Google has literally built a multibillion dollar business on its ability to answer questions. (Pichai said Tuesday Google’s Knowledge Graph is loaded with a growing library of 70 billion facts.) Now it’s focusing that expertise on AI that will be with you no matter where you are. Your home. Your car. Your phone. And soon, everywhere else. The AI assistant race is the next major battle in personal computing, and Assistant is the first step towards that ever-present, voice-controlled computer. It already wipes the floor with the competition, and it’s tough to see how anyone else can keep up.

Google launched an aggressive challenge to Apple and Samsung introducing its own new line of smartphones called Pixel, which are designed to showcase a digital helper the company calls "Google Assistant." Photo: AP mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 5:35 AM, October 5, 2016 Updated: 6:53 PM, October 5, 2016 SAN FRANCISCO — Google opened fire on rivals Apple, Samsung and Amazon in a new push into hardware Tuesday (Oct 4), launching premium-priced Pixel smartphones and a slew of other devices showcasing artificial intelligence prowess. The unveiling of Google’s in-house designed phone came as part of an expanded hardware move by the US giant, which also revealed details of its new “home assistant”, virtual reality headset and Wi-Fi router system. The San Francisco event marked a shift in strategy for Google, which is leading a major push to make Google Assistant artificial intelligence a futuristic force spanning all kinds of Internet-linked devices. Google chief executive Sundar Pichai said the new devices were part of Google’s strategy to bring artificial intelligence to a range of new devices. “We are evolving from a mobile-first world to an AI-first world,” he said, adding that the latest push is an extension of the Google search capacity by assisting consumers in finding and organising information. “Our goal is to build a personal Google for each and every user.” Mr Rick Osterloh, head of a new hardware division at the California-based Internet giant, added, “We believe that the next big innovation is going to take place at the intersection of hardware and software, with AI at the centre.” Pixel will be available with a five- or 5.5-inch display, starting at US$649 (S$889.67) for US customers, at similar prices to the latest iPhone models. Pre-orders began Tuesday in Australia, Canada, Germany, Britain, and the United States. MADE BY GOOGLE Google, by using its own name on handsets, is aiming for a bigger slice of a competitive smartphone market dominated by Samsung and Apple. Until now, Google’s flagship devices had used the Nexus brand with hardware partners that have included China’s Huawei and South Korea’s LG. The California group also sought to expand in the smartphone market by purchasing Motorola in 2011, but sold the unit less than three years later. “Google today demonstrated that it’s finally serious about hardware,” said Jan Dawson at Jackdaw Research. “The Pixel phones are clearly being positioned as peers to the iPhone.” The new Pixel phone is “the first phone made by Google inside and out,” said Ms Sabrina Ellis of the Pixel product management team. By producing both the hardware and Android software, Google is making a more direct assault on Apple and its tightly controlled ecosystem. Along with being the first smartphone to ship with Google Assistant, it will come with unlimited storage for photos and videos and be compatible with the company’s new Daydream virtual reality platform. Pixel has a “smart” camera which can select the best images from a stream, and a program to make it easy for users to switch operating systems, a move aimed at winning over iPhone users. Analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy said it may be challenging for Google to gain market share. “Aside from the camera, the new Google Pixels are pretty undifferentiated compared to Samsung and iPhone 7th generation phones,” Mr Moorhead said. “They don’t exactly swing anyone around the room.” APPLE’S WORLD Gartner analyst Brian Blau said that “the most exciting part of the announcement today was the assistant,” which showcases Google’s strength in artificial intelligence. “It’s a different tactic from Google, taking the stance that they want to have that direct relationship with their customers,” Mr Blau told AFP. “It is clearly a step into Apple’s world” of controlling hardware and software and services, he added. Pixel will be sold through US carrier Verizon and telecom groups, and available at Google’s online shop unlocked. As part of its expanded hardware push, Google also showed off a new Daydream View headset that compatible smartphones can be slipped into to serve as screens for virtual reality experiences. View headsets are made of soft cloth, purportedly inspired by casual clothes. Daydream View bundled with a controller device will be available in November, priced at US$79. Google added to the coming hardware line-up with a modular Wi-Fi system that lets a set of inter-connected mini-modems be spread around homes to make signals strong in all spots. “Unlike a single, central router, multiple Google Wi-Fi points do a better job of delivering connectivity to all parts of the home,” said Google executive Mario Queiroz. The Internet giant also introduced its Google Home virtual assistant that will be a direct challenge to popular Amazon Echo devices. Google described Home as a voice-activated assistant that lets people tap into the company’s online capabilities to answer questions, manage tasks, control devices in homes, stream videos and more. The $129 Google Home device be available in retail shops on November 4.

Daydream View, a $79 headset unveiled by the company on Tuesday, has the same basic design as many other mobile VR headsets. The front opens up to allow you to slide in a phone—either Google’s new Pixel phone or any of the incoming Daydream-compatible phones from Android partners. After you strap it to your head, you peer at the phone through two lenses that help create the impression of a 360-degree screen. The first thing that sets it apart is the fact that it’s made from materials you’re likely to find in clothing—about as far as you can get from the plastic and foam construction of its competitors. The headset also comes with a remote. The palm-sized device has a clickable touch pad and two buttons, but can also be moved, pointed, and swung for motion-based interaction with the headset. Tapping on the side of Samsung’s Gear VR headset has never felt particularly comfortable or intuitive. Google Cardboard really only has one button, limiting what you can do. This one will make interaction much easier for games and scrolling through the headset’s user interface. Google worked with clothing designers to create the Daydream View. The second and by far the biggest difference from Daydream View’s competitors is in the phone that slips into it and the software behind it. The beautiful design, cohesive software, and app store experience in Apple’s iPhones drove much of the innovation in the first phase in smartphones. Google’s Pixel phone marks the arrival of the next phase. Our phones are now a central part of our lives, but Google has reimagined how they fit in with the rest of our technology. Pixel, which starts at $649, puts a virtual assistant at its core. You can ask it to make a dinner reservation, look up show times and calculate the driving distance between the restaurant and the theater. It’s a bot that pulls together the intelligence from all of your apps and makes them accessible in one place (see "Google's Assistant Is More Ambitious Than Siri and Alexa"). “AI could be a game changer for VR as it allows us to skip the tedious launching of apps and think about getting experiences delivered to you as soon as you ask, in a highly immersive way,” says Jon Mann, UX design director at design consultancy firm Artefact. Alongside Daydream View and Pixel, Google also introduced a new Chromecast dongle and Home—a countertop assistance device similar to Amazon Echo. It’s one big ecosystem that lets you switch to whatever screen makes the most sense for a particular moment. A VR headset is no longer a novelty accessory that you can pick up and fidget around with on your own time. It’s a core piece of Google’s new lineup. So what about Cardboard? It’s unlikely the low-cost VR headset will go away. VR has yet to gain a foothold in every house in the nation, so it’s still useful for the New York Times and other companies to be able to ship out cheap headsets by the thousands. But Daydream View is such a simple add-on for Pixel and other Daydream-compatible phones that Cardboard can finally begin its descent into irrelevance.

Alongside their latest in mobile products, Google also used this morning’s event to announce the 3rd generation of Chromecast, the Chromecast Ultra. The last Chromecast is more of a supplement than a replacement of the current Chromecast 2. Launching at $69, the Ultra’s major feature additions are 4K video support with HDR – essentially upgrading the Chromecast to keep up with the latest in video technology standards. Alongside the new hardware, Google has also announced that they are going to be upgrading their software ecosystem for 4K, including selling 4K movies through the Google Play store. Google Chromecast Family   Chromecast Ultra Chromecast (2) Chromecast Audio Processor ? Marvell ARMADA 1500 Mini Plus SoC (88DE3006) Marvell ARMADA 1500 Mini Plus SoC (88DE3006) Memory ? 512MB N/A Wireless 1x2 2.4GHz/5GHz 802.11ac 1x2 2.4GHz/5GHz 802.11ac 1x2 2.4GHz/5GHz 802.11ac Display Output 4K w/HDR (HDR10 & Dolby Vision) 1080p N/A Max Video Decode 4K 1080p30 N/A Ports HDMI 2.0 Micro-USB Ethernet (On Power Adapter) HDMI 1.3 Micro-USB (Power) 3.5mm Combo Jack (Analog + Optical Audio) Micro-USB (Power) Launch Date 11/2016 09/29/2015 09/29/2015 Launch Price $69 $35 $35 Unfortunately specifications on the hardware itself are limited at this time. Google isn’t saying much beyond the fact that the Ultra is capable of decoding and displaying 4K content. From the hardware capabilities alone it’s clear that the underlying SoC is something capable of decoding 4K content and outputting it over HDMI 2.0 with HDCP. This should, with any luck, also mean that we’re finally getting a Chromecast from Google that can handle 1080p60, which has been the Achilles Heel of the prior versions of the media streamer. Given that it’s a Google product, I’d also expect that VP9 support is present, while HEVC support is going to be more questionable. On the video format front, the big news here of course is that the Chromecast Ultra can handle 4K video. However Google didn’t stop there; the Ultra also supports HDR video via both the HDR10 and Dolby Vision standards. The latter is a particularly interesting development, as to date Dolby Vision support has been very rare. I’m very curious to see where Dolby Vision factors into Google’s larger plans given that they’re bucking the trend here and have their own major content distribution platform. At least for owners of TVs that support he standard, this could help kickstart its use in streaming services. Meanwhile as Google opted to spend the bulk of their efforts on updating the internals of the Chromecast, the overall design has not significantly changed since last year’s Chomecast 2. The Ultra is still a puck – albeit one that looks slightly thicker than the last – and implements a pair of antennas for improved WiFi reception. At the same time, for users and environments who can’t make WiFi work for them, Google has added Ethernet capabilities to the Ultra by placing an Ethernet port on the power adapter, giving users a wired option to fallback to. Wrapping things up, the Chromecast Ultra will be launching in November for $69. At almost double the price of the Chromecast 2, this is not going to be replacing the cheaper Chromecast, but instead serve as a premium option for 4K. At the same time, as one of the original Chromecast’s primarily selling points was its low price, it will be interesting to see how the Chromecast Ultra does now that it’s priced closer to stand-alone media streamers. For 4K this is still very much a budget option, but it’s not going to fit the impulse purchase market like the Chromecast 2 does.

I see you fixed the launch date as I was writing my comment. On a hunch I refreshed the page before posting. Anyhow, thanks for the clear breakdown. Interested to see what SoC turns up in the teardown. Reply JeffFlanagan - Tuesday, October 04, 2016 - link Can it play NetFlix 4K shows? Reply nevcairiel - Tuesday, October 04, 2016 - link That is entirely up to Netflix. Reply Alexvrb - Tuesday, October 04, 2016 - link Not *entirely* up to Netflix. The device still has to support whatever format they use. Some/most of Netflix's 4K content is HEVC. I don't know if it's all also encoded in VP9. Does this support HEVC @ 4K? I would hope so but the details are scant. "Supports Netflix" is a bit vague, Ryan. If I was doing a press release and it supported the latest codec @ 4K, I'd mention it. Did they mention it? Other questions... does it support HDMI 2.0a? It only says 2.0 on the chart so I'd guess no. Dedicated remote option doubtful. I'm eyeing a Roku Premiere+ for the downstairs TV. XB1 handles the media upstairs for me. Although that will improve further once the UWP version of VLC hits the XB1. Oh also this isn't a dongle... it's a dangle. :D Reply cyrand - Wednesday, October 05, 2016 - link I was under the impressions that HDMI 2.0a was required to support HDR10 and HDR10 support is listed in specs. It would still be nice for someone to confirms this. Reply Alexvrb - Saturday, October 08, 2016 - link Ah, well that settles that. Thanks. That's one detail down. Reply Ryan Smith - Tuesday, October 04, 2016 - link Yes. Google has mentioned in their press materials that it supports Netflix. Reply cheinonen - Tuesday, October 04, 2016 - link Netflix already streams UHD and HDR content using GoogleCast to the Vizio P and M series TVs this year so yes, it does. Reply nathanddrews - Tuesday, October 04, 2016 - link F to the Yeah! Reply solipsism - Tuesday, October 04, 2016 - link 1) I assume the Ethernet is 10/100, not GigE. It's not mandatory for media extender appliance, but it does seem to reduce buffering with high-profile content (providing the rest of the HW isn't a bottleneck). 2) Any words on codecs? It's great that it supports 2160p, but I'd like to start seeing more HEVC to help reduce those file sizes.

Home Industry Tech Google’s new lineup of phones and gadgets: A quick glance Google’s new lineup of phones and gadgets: A quick glance Here's a quick glance of Google's new lineup of phones and gadgets By: Associated Press | San Fransisco | Published: October 5, 2016 3:01 AM Rick Osterloh, head of Google’s new hardware group, said that in doing so, Google can take full advantage of capabilities it’s designing with artificial intelligence and machine learning. (Reuters) Google is taking a page from Apple’s playbook by making a bigger push to build its own hardware. Rick Osterloh, head of Google’s new hardware group, said that in doing so, Google can take full advantage of capabilities it’s designing with artificial intelligence and machine learning. Apple has long designed both iPhone hardware and the iOS operating-system software that runs on it. Now, Google is doing the same with the upcoming Pixel phones running Google’s Android system. The Pixel is one of several gadgets Google announced Tuesday in San Francisco. NEW PHONE, NEW BRANDING, NEW MARKETING Google’s previous phones, dubbed Nexus, had limited distribution. Now, the company is casting aside the Nexus name in favor of Pixel, a brand that Osterloh said has ”always represented the best of hardware and software designed by Google.” And instead of relying primarily on online orders, as was the case with Nexus, Google will offer Pixel through Verizon as well, starting Oct. 20. Advance orders begin Tuesday starting at roughly $650 for the 5-inch version and $750 for the slightly larger 5.5-inch screen. One of the advantages Google phones have long had is their quick access to Android updates. With other phones, individual manufacturers and carriers have to approve changes, resulting in delays . Google said Verizon will still have to approve updates for Pixel, but the process will be streamlined and done ahead of time. Google promises a spectacular camera and unlimited online storage for phones at full resolution. When storage space on the phone is low, the Pixel will free up storage and rely on the online copy. Apple takes a similar approach with its iCloud Photo Library, though free storage is limited to 5 gigabytes, or a few thousand photos. IT’S IN YOUR HEAD Google’s new virtual-reality headset, Daydream View, will differ from other headsets like Samsung’s Gear VR in having a companion motion controller and compatibility with a wide range of phones, including Pixel. Daydream is also a challenge to more sophisticated, but expensive systems from Facebook’s Oculus business, HTC and Sony – as well as to Google’s own Cardboard effort. Cardboard is cheap – available for as little as $15 – but it doesn’t offer much control over VR environments beyond pushing a button on the headset as you move your head. The new wireless motion controller for Daydream can function like a fishing rod, a steering wheel or a pointer to permit more sophisticated VR experiences. Daydream View and the controller will be out in November for $79. You’ll need a new Android phone , as existing phones won’t have the right hardware. Google also plans to share design guidelines with other manufacturers to make Daydream headsets and controllers. AN ECHO OF AMAZON’S ECHO Google is promoting its new Home smart speaker as a way to access Google’s knowledge – hands free. Home will be able to perform many of the same tasks as Echo, Amazon’s internet-connected speaker. Both will use voice commands to play music, field questions and control home appliances – assuming you’ve installed ”smart” versions of them. If you’re feeling creepy about a speaker listening to your conversations, Google says you can turn the microphone off. Home will be available on Nov. 4 for about $130, with advance orders starting Tuesday. The cylinder-shaped Echo costs $180, though Amazon also sells a smaller version shaped like a hockey puck that sells for $50. WHAT ELSE? Google’s new video-streaming device, Chromecast Ultra, will support a higher-resolution video format called 4K. Larger, more expensive streaming devices such as the $100 Amazon Fire TV already do that. Ultra will cost $69. Meanwhile, Google wants to improve Wi-Fi in the home by creating its own router. The company said people use internet differently now, with games, video chatting and more on various devices throughout the home. The new Google Wi-Fi system will cost about $130 for the main device. A three-pack for larger homes will cost about $300. BEYOND GOOGLE Even as it pushes Pixel, Google isn’t abandoning the Android system that other manufacturers can use for free. That means Samsung, LG and others can keep making their own phones with Google software. In that sense, Google’s approach is more like Microsoft’s than Apple’s. Microsoft also has been making hardware through its line of Surface computers running Windows. That puts Microsoft – and now Google – in the awkward position of promoting both its own devices and those of rivals that run the company’s software. BEYOND HARDWARE Google predicts that artificial intelligence will play a greater role in our lives. CEO Sundar Pichai said computing is transitioning to an AI -first world, just as it moved to a mobile-first world just a few years ago. ”Our goal is to build a personal Google for each and every user,” Pichai said. ”We want to build a Google for each user.” Google services along those lines include Google Assistant, software that’s designed to answer questions and retrieve information, conversation-style. Google Assistant made its debut in a chat app called Allo a few weeks ago. It will also be part of Home and the new Pixel phones. The features demonstrated Tuesday seem similar to what Amazon and Apple already offer with their virtual assistants. Google officials have repeatedly emphasized that its AI technology is in the early stages – so it remains to be seen what this new era for Google will lead to.

The string of announcements — including the $649 Pixel, a smart speaker for the living room dubbed “Home,” a virtual reality headset, and a new Wi-Fi router — is the clearest sign yet that Google intends to compete head-to-head with Apple, Amazon.com Inc and even manufacturers of phones using its own Android mobile operating system. Company executives, echoing Apple’s longstanding philosophy, said they were striving for tighter integration of hardware and software. “The thinking is that if we can work on hardware and software together, we can innovate much better,” Google hardware chief Rick Osterloh said in an interview with Reuters, citing a recent reorganization that united once-disparate hardware teams. Under the new structure, the company has begun to take a much more integrated approach to things like supply chain management and design, added Mario Queiroz, a vice president of product management. “The learnings from one product are benefiting another product,” he said.. Behind the Pixel: Google's first real threat to Apple's iPhone Google goes after iPhone user with pricey Pixel Unlike earlier Google phone efforts under the Nexus brand, the Pixel devices are designed and developed by Google from the start, although Taiwan’s HTC Corp will serve as the contract manufacturer. Taking another page from the Apple playbook, Google said it would work exclusively with a single carrier in the United States, Verizon Communications Inc, on the Pixel, emulating Apple’s agreement to launch the original iPhone with AT&T Inc. That deal gave Apple unprecedented control over the look of the phone and how it worked. Shares of Alphabet closed up 0.3 percent, while Verizon fell 1.2 percent. The phone comes in two sizes, and its high-end camera is one of few distinguishing features, analysts said. The phones come in black, blue and silver and will be able to get up to a seven-hour charge in 15 minutes. Pre-orders begin on Tuesday. “Aside from the camera, the new Google Pixels are pretty undifferentiated compared to Samsung and iPhone seventh generation phones,” industry analyst Patrick Moorhead said. While the new phones are clearly aimed at competing with the iPhone - Google executives took several swipes at Apple in their on-stage remarks - analysts said Android rivals like Samsung Electronics could be the biggest victim if the Pixel takes off. Pictures: Pixel smartphones, new Google hardware unveiled Google’s strategy of licensing Android for free and profiting from embedded services such as search and maps made Android the dominant mobile operating system with some 89 percent of the global market, according to IDC. But Apple still rules the high end of the market, and Google has long been frustrated by the emergence of many variations of Android and the inconsistent experience that has produced. Pushing its own hardware will likely complicate its relationship with Android licensees, analysts said. Google kicked off the event Tuesday by touting the Google Assistant, the company’s voice-activated artificial intelligence system and its answer to Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa. The presenter showed how a customers could make a restaurant reservation with a few phrases spoken into the phone. The assistant will be embedded into the Pixel and Home products and is being positioned as the central feature in a family of integrated hardware and software products. It is one of a handful of similar assistants that are vying for supremacy as more people search the web and make purchases online using voice commands, which may eventually supplant keyboards and touchscreens as the primary means of controlling digital devices.

The Home device and the Echo have many of the same features. Google’s “Daydream View” virtual reality headset, meanwhile, puts the company in competition with Facebook Inc, owner of Oculus. The device, which works with an Android phone, is far cheaper and simpler. It will be available in November for $79, in time for the end-of-year shopping season. Home will also be available in November for $129, including a six-month trial of ad-free YouTube. Google also unveiled a new version of its Chromecast digital media player and a router dubbed Google Wifi, both boasting the same sleek, minimalist design as the Home product. “These look like products from a single company,” said Queiroz, the Google executive.

With the introduction of a new phone and smart speaker, Google is taking on its Silicon Valley competitors and also playing catch-up. Google, best known for its search and Android, is taking a big step into the hardware world -- a place where until recently it had only a light footprint. During a presentation in San Francisco, Google repeatedly said that in order to be competitive it must be in both the hardware and software businesses. Having a foot in both worlds, Google officials suggested, allowed for greater innovation -- namely in artificial intelligence(AI), which Google clearly believes is the next big evolution in our digital lives. “We’re at a seminal moment for computer. If you step back and think about it, computing has had big shifts every 10 years or so,” said Google CEO Sundar Pichai, before adding, “we’re evolving from a mobile first, to an AI-first world.” "Your Own Google" The company is officially debuting Google Assistant -- its own intelligent personal assistant, which will compete with the likes of Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa. The virtual assistant will be available across multiple devices and will rely on voice recognition. It's meant to provide easy access to both personal information -- like contacts, calendar events and other data stored on your phone -- and information on the web. The Google Assistant is at the core of several devices that the company debuted today. Of those, the most notable is its new phone. Pixel Perfect? Taking a direct shot at Apple’s newly-released iPhone 7, Google introduced Pixel, a smartphone that will have its software and hardware designed in-house at Google. Pixel is hardly Google’s first foray into the smartphone market. It is, however, the first time that the company has handled the design of both the hardware and software behind a smartphone. Its previous Nexus phones were manufactured by other companies, but branded and sold by Google. The new aluminum phone, available for order today, will come in 5-inch and 5.5-inch models. There are three colors: silver, black and a limited-edition blue. Both sizes come in either 32-gigabyte or 128-gigabyte -- far lower than the 128-gigabyte and 256-gigabyte offerings in Apple’s latest iteration of the iPhone. The phone is sold exclusively through Verizon in the U.S., but will also be available for sale on Google's website unlocked, meaning it can be used with other networks. It starts at $649. Users can take advantage of the unlimited photo and video storage that Google is now offering through its cloud storage service. In comparison, Apple customers receive limited storage on Apple’s iCloud storage service and must pay for higher quantities. Google was quick to tout the camera on the new phone, which received a score of 89 from DxOMark, a camera review firm. The score puts it at the top of all smartphones that DxOMark reviewed. By comparison, the iPhone 7 received a score of 86 on the 100-point scale. Another feature that Google is promoting is the phone's battery, which the company says can provide seven hours of battery life with only a 15-minute charge. Finally, Google is offering a “quick switch adapter,” which it claims will make it easy to transfer contacts, videos, photos, music, as well as iMessages and SMS messages from an iPhone to a Pixel. Echoing Amazon’s Echo The Pixel wasn’t Google’s only big hardware announcement today. Google is taking on Amazon’s popular Echo with the introduction of its own smart speaker, the Google Home. Like the smartphone, it features Google Assistant. With Home, the Google Assistant is at the heart of all functionality. The speaker, which has a design inspired by wine glasses and candles, promises to provide users with easy access to information and entertainment while also allowing them to control other smart home devices and complete small tasks, all through voice control. More than one of the devices can be used in a home, according to Google, allowing users to stream the same song throughout the house. The company says that the speakers won’t be confused by voice activation as long as they are registered through the same account. All new Google Home devices will come with a free six-month YouTube Red subscription. The price starts at $129, and it is available now. Wi-Fi Google introduced a Wi-Fi router, which it is calling Google Wi-Fi. The most notable feature? Multiple Google Wi-Fi devices can be used together to create coverage throughout your house. One device should cover a 1,500-square foot home, Google says. The company also says the device is optimized for high-bandwidth activities like streaming movies and online gaming. It will include “Network Assist,” which Google says will make it easier to set up and manage a wireless connection. Finally, the router will allow parents to "pause” their children’s internet connection through a companion smartphone app, providing downtime from the internet without having to unplug the router. It is available in November for $129, or three routers can be bought for $299. Daydreaming about Virtual Reality Google also debuted Daydream View, a virtual reality headset and controller that will work with the Pixel and other phones to provide “high-quality, immersive VR,” the company says. The headset, which is covered in fabric rather than hard plastic, will be available in November for $79. Chromecast Goes Ultra Finally, the company debuted its newest Chromecast device -- the Chromecast Ultra. Available in November for $69, it will allow streaming of 4K Ultra HD and High Dynamic Range video to a television while providing faster speeds as users navigate around the interface. It also features a wired ethernet connection for environments where Wi-Fi connectivity may be limited. 0 Shares Email Star Comments " Google Introduces Smartphone to Compete With Apple, Amazon Dying UK Girl Convinces Judge to Let Her Body Be Frozen China Astronauts Return From Monthlong Space Station Stay Current Energy System Could Eat up Entire Carbon Budget In Graveyard of Dead Coral in Pacific, Hope and Life Bloom Google Disappointed by South Korean Refusal on Mapping Data Google Hits Pixel Resellers With 'Digital Death Sentence' Facebook Boosts Efforts to 'Do Good' With New Tools " Rocket Carrying Crew of 3 Blasts off for Int'l Space Station US Solar Panel Maker to Cut 1,600 Jobs, 450 at Plant in Ohio " Trump Offers Sen.

Share Tweet Whatsapp Email Share Google takes on Apple with new Pixel phone - Yahoo7 Pinterest Tumblr Alphabet Inc's Google has announced a new "Pixel" smartphone and a virtual reality headset, the company's latest effort to sell consumers on Google-branded devices and to challenge Apple Inc's iPhone at the high end of the more than $US400 billion ($A525 billion) global market. The new phone starts at a price of $649 ($A852), and Google is working exclusively with Verizon Communications in the United States, Google executives said at a launch event in San Francisco on Tuesday. The string of announcements, including a new Wifi router and its voice activated digital assistant for the living room, "Home," is the clearest sign yet that Google intends to compete directly with Apple, Amazon.com and even its own Android mobile operating system customers to create a system of devices and hardware that meet every digital need. The Pixel also represents a more hands-on policy by Google. Google lets Android device makers modify software almost without limit, which has helped make Android the most-used mobile operating system in the world. But company executives boasted that the Pixel was developed in-house from start to finish. Shares of Alphabet were up a tick in early afternoon New York trade. Shares of Verizon were down about 1.4 per cent. Google's decision to launch with a single carrier echoes Apple's agreement to launch the original iPhone with AT&T, a deal that gave Apple unprecedented control over the look of the phone and how it worked. Google has for years toyed with various approaches to building its own hardware without alienating manufacturers such as Samsung Electronics, the world's top smartphone maker. Google has sold another line of phones, called Nexus, since 2010, but the devices have gained little traction. Google also announced a "Daydream View" virtual reality headset, which will be available in November for $US79, in time for the end-of-year shopping season. Home will be available for $US129, including a six-month trial of ad-free YouTube. Pixel phones will come in black, blue and silver and will have 12.7 cm and 14 cm screens. It will have what Google called the best-rated camera on the market and will be able to get a 7-hour charge in 15 minutes. Pre-orders begin on Tuesday. Because its mobile software is available so widely, Google has struggled to distinguish its own devices, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. Google "wants to have this end-to-end experience, but it's not clear that people really want that," Dawson said. The Home device represents an important move in an intensifying battle between Google and other major tech players to establish the dominant "digital assistant." Google Assistant, Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri are vying for supremacy as more people search the web and make purchases online through voice commands, which may eventually supplant keyboards and touchscreens as the primary means of controlling some digital devices.

So much so that it's basically clothes. Google took to the stage today in San Francisco to announce firm details surrounding their latest slew of hardware products. The leaks of the Google Pixel gave us a good idea of what to expect from the company's first Google-branded phone. And then there were details we didn't about: the final version of Google's new VR efforts, Daydream View, saw the light of day as well as Google Wifi (a mesh-networking-supporting router) and an official unveil for Google Home. Google's stated goal is to make products that blend in with the objects of your house: "Our design was inspired by consumer products that are commonly found in homes. Like wine glasses and candles.” In this respect the search company succeeded. Maybe too much. In revealing the new Daydream View VR headset, Google's Clay Bavor stressed the importance of comfort. And judging by the material of the headset alone, looks like Google totally nailed it. With a fresh-smelling home fit to answer questions, and comfortable VR sleepwear you can put right on your face, the only question that remains is: when will the rest of the matching Daydream View outfit come out? The fashion-conscious are impatiently waiting.

Author: Brian Barrett. Brian Barrett Gear Date of Publication: 10.04.16. 10.04.16 Time of Publication: 4:59 pm. 4:59 pm Google Pixel Upends the Android Universe By the time Google announced its pair of Pixel smartphones on Tuesday, the devices had already been leaked all to pieces. Shape, size, specs; even color variants were laid bare by clumsy carriers. In fact, just about the only thing left unknown about the Pixels is what they’ll do to the already splintered Android ecosystem. Google had previously released smartphones, made by a revolving set of hardware partners, under its Nexus line. But Nexus devices, despite consistent excellence, never amounted to more than a sideshow. Pixel wants to be the main event. And that should make other Android manufacturers very, very nervous. Fractures Android has a problem worth solving. It’s a terrific operating system. The latest release, Android Nougat, is both mature and refined, full of thoughtful and responsive touches that rival anything iOS can offer. If only anyone could use it. Two weeks after it started rolling out, Nougat had reached fewer than 0.1 percent of Android devices. In fact, the most popular Android version today remains Android KitKat. It came out in the fall of 2013. More Android David Pierce Google Pixel Sounds Like the Android Phone of Our Dreams David Pierce Google’s Going to Change the Gadget Game, But Not Like You Think David Pierce Android Nougat Proves How Good Google’s OS Already Is Brian Barrett Google Home Is Finally Ready to Rumble With Amazon Echo Android fragmentation is not a new lament, but it’s an increasingly irksome one. Updates need to route through a complex obstacle course of carriers and manufacturers, if they ever make it at all. Recent hardware releases get left behind; security issues go unpatched. User experience suffers. It’s frustrating, for users and Google alike. Things aren’t much prettier on the hardware side. “Android has always been a fickle master—it’s been an enabler of a huge chunk of the smartphone market, but with very few exceptions it hasn’t been a driver of significant margins, and the lack of differentiation between Android vendors has created something of a race to the bottom in recent years,” says Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research. It’s a bifurcated market. Samsung dominates the top end, while a raft of low-cost imports scrap it out in the affordable territories. Those who have attempted to occupy the middle, like HTC, have gotten squeezed. An open ecosystem that should promise choice has resulted in surprisingly little of it. “The fragmented Android ecosystem is very competitive with very low margins,” says Anindya Ghose, director of the Center for Business Analytics at NYU Stern. “Even Samsung makes only 17 percent margins.” Nexus devices didn’t offer Google much remedy. The phones were high-quality and competitively priced, but sold primarily through Google’s own limited channels.(The exception to this was the giant, Motorola-made Nexus 6, an expensive phone with carrier partners, released just after Google’s brief Motorola ownership. It could be seen as a sort of Pixel trial run.) More to the point, Nexus phones were built through partnerships with bona fide phone-makers; they were a chance for manufacturers to show off their chops as much as for Google to show off Android. In practice, that meant many Nexus devices felt like repeats of existing third-party hardware—and carried their limitations as well. With Pixel, that changes. Pixel Perfect Unlike the Nexus devices, the Pixel is purely Google’s vision. The company outsourced manufacturing to HTC, but everything about Pixel is made to Google’s exact specifications. Even the tagline, Made by Google, not so subtly reminds that all other Android devices are not. This is as pure a vision of what Google wants in a smartphone as has ever existed. It also couldn’t come at a more critical time. The other tentpoles of Google’s Tuesday announcement were Google Assistant, an AI-powered helper that hopes to anticipate your every need, and Daydream, a sleek stab at creating virtual reality for the masses. These products, and others like them, aren’t just Google’s future. They’re the future of personal computing. Those stakes are too high to leave to someone else’s design team. “Building hardware and software together lets us take full advantage of capabilities like the Google Assistant,” said Rick Osterloh, Google’s SVP of hardware. “It lets us harness years of expertise we’ve built up in machine learning and AI to deliver the simple, smart, and fast experiences that our users expect from us.” The inspiration here is clear enough that you could just as easily call it a blueprint. Apple’s unwavering command over both hardware and software let the iPhone become one of the most successful consumer products in history. The Pixel doesn’t just look like the iPhone; it aspires to its clone its success as well. It’s the right move. A Pixel smartphone won’t just have the latest Android version and the best camera. It’s going to be the spool from which Google’s new voice-controlled ecosystem will be threaded. It’s meant to be the window through which a generation views virtual worlds. “It is well known that Android can be much better optimized than what it is today,” says Ghose. “By controlling the hardware, Google can dramatically improve the reliability and consistency of the user experience on Android phones.” All of which is to say that Pixel is serious. And it could be a serious problem for anyone else in the Android business. Points of Sale While Pixel smartphones will create a shining example of what an Android device can be, they’ll also make life that much harder on anyone else who makes them. “All else equal, an HTC or a Huawei would want to be a true partner rather than just a contractor,” says Ghose. “But Google does not want any other manufacturer’s brand to shine on Pixel other than its own.” Being paid as a contractor is better than not making any money at all—a situation with which HTC is painfully familiar. But even then, there are only so many Pixel contracts to go around. And everyone else making Android devices faces the prospect of being even further behind. Aside from the obvious under-the-hood benefits of Google controlling both hardware and software, Pixel phones launch as the only smartphones with Google Assistant built in. That’s a genuine point of differentiation, especially as Google pushes its broader ecosystem with Google Home and Chromecast. Pixel phones will be more efficient, more feature-filled, and more broadly integrated than any other Android competitor, full stop. And they’ll continue to be for as long as Google makes them. The possible upside to all of this is that it will push manufacturers like Samsung and LG and Motorola to innovate and iterate even more aggressively. We’ve seen some of that in the laptop space, after Microsoft similarly shook an industry by bringing the Surface Book in-house. In fact, we’ve already started to see it, whether it’s modular designs from LG and Motorola or continued hardware excellence—explosions aside—from Samsung. Google, too, says it will stand by its Android partners. And it also sees Pixel as an innovation engine. “We want to continue to see the entire Android ecosystem thrive,” says Google spokesperson Iska Saric. “With these new phones, we aim to provide the best Google phone experience, which we hope will also contribute to future innovation and development of the ecosystem.” Hardware manufacturers have other options, too. They could embrace an emerging operating system, though Samsung’s early adventures with Tizen don’t offer much encouragement there. Or they could turn to other product categories for relief, as HTC has virtual reality. Whatever the future, an already brutal Android ecosystem just got even more so. The Pixel looks great, unless you happen to share its software DNA. Then it looks like a long, slow fade. “Hardware isn’t a new area for Google, but now we’re taking steps to showcase the very best of Google across a family of devices designed and built for us,” said Osterloh. “This is a natural step, and we’re in it for the long run.” This story has been updated to include comment from Google.

DxO Labs' DxOMark site claims the Pixel to feature the "best smartphone camera ever." This is certainly big news if true; let's take a look at the specifics. The Pixel's 12.3-megapixel camera has a 1.55-micron pixel size, which is quite large for a smartphone camera, and it scored an 89 from DxOMark. DxO Labs says the Pixel's image quality is "impressive across the board", and that it captures images with "relatively low levels of noise for every tested lighting condition." Unlike the iPhone 7 or Samsung's Galaxy S7, the Pixel comes equipped with an f/2.0 lens rather than the f/1.8 and f/1.7 lenses found in Apple and Samsung's offerings, respectively. Nonetheless, DxO Mark found it to be a very capable low light camera. It's worth noting that Apple's latest iPhone 7 scored an 86 from DxOMark, while the iPhone 7 Plus is still being reviewed currently. There are new camera features which should please more than just the pixel peepers, too. According to Engadget, the Pixel has the shortest shutter lag of any cameraphone ever tested by Google. That short capture time has allowed Google to keep the Pixel's high dynamic range (HDR) shooting mode enabled at all times. While Google's HDR+ was in last year's Nexus 6P phone among others, the Pixel is able to combine multiple RAW images in near-real time. DxOMark states that while Google isn't the first to include HDR functionality in a smartphone camera, it has managed to do it the best so far in terms of both quality and speed. To power all of this photo processing, the phone comes with 4 gigabytes of RAM and has a Snapdragon 821 CPU. While not extensively discussed during today's event, Google has a handy way for you to store all of your excellent smartphone photos captured with the Pixel. Provided that you have a Google account, you'll have unlimited storage for backing up all of your photos and videos. Speaking of video, DxOMark found the Pixel to be excellent at that too. It can record 4K video at up to 30 frames per second and 1080p video at up to 120fps.     You aren't likely going to buy a smartphone just for its camera, so what else do the Pixel and Pixel XL offer? The former has a 5-inch AMOLED display with 1920 x 1080 resolution whereas the latter has a 5.5-inch AMOLED display with 2560 x 1440 resolution. Both Pixel phones come with Google Assistant, making them the first phones to hit the market equipped with Google's updated artificial intelligence companion. (Think Google Now, Siri or Cortana.). Also, in a move sure to leave iPhone fans even more ticked off at the Cupertino company, Google's new handsets include headphone jacks. Of course, Apple would doubtless note that its phones are water resistant, a feature both of Google's Pixel phones lack. (But then, we've seen plenty of water-resistant or even waterproof phones with uncapped 3.5mm jacks before now.) And for those looking to hop on board the virtual reality train, the Pixel can power Google's new Daydream View VR headset, which you can learn more about here.     These new phones are available for preorder now. The Pixel starts at around $650 and the XL adds an additional $120 to the cost. The phones come in silver, black and blue color options and the base model includes 32 GB of storage (for an additional $100, you can bump up the space to 128 GB). Verizon will be the exclusive carrier partner for the pair of Pixel phones in the United States, at least for the time being, although you can purchase it unlocked directly from Google for use on other carriers.

The string of announcements — including the $649 Pixel, a smart speaker for the living room dubbed “Home,” a virtual reality headset, and a new Wi-Fi router — is the clearest sign yet that Google intends to compete head-to-head with Apple, Amazon.com Inc. and even manufacturers of phones using its own Android mobile operating system. Company executives, echoing Apple’s long-standing philosophy, said they were striving for tighter integration of hardware and software. “The thinking is that if we can work on hardware and software together, we can innovate much better,” Google hardware chief Rick Osterloh said in an interview, citing a recent reorganization that united once-disparate hardware teams. Under the new structure, the company has begun to take a much more integrated approach to things like supply chain management and design, added Mario Queiroz, a vice president of product management. “The learnings from one product are benefiting another product,” he said. Unlike earlier Google phone efforts under the Nexus brand, the Pixel devices are designed and developed by Google from the start, although Taiwan’s HTC Corp. will serve as the contract manufacturer. Taking another page from the Apple playbook, Google said it would work exclusively with a single carrier in the United States, Verizon Communications Inc., on the Pixel, emulating Apple’s agreement to launch the original iPhone with AT&T Inc. That deal gave Apple unprecedented control over the look of the phone and how it worked. The phone comes in two sizes, and its high-end camera is one of few distinguishing features, analysts said. The phones come in black, blue and silver and will be able to get up to a seven-hour charge in 15 minutes. Pre-orders begin on Tuesday. “Aside from the camera, the new Google Pixels are pretty undifferentiated compared to Samsung and iPhone seventh-generation phones,” industry analyst Patrick Moorhead said. While the new phones are clearly aimed at competing with the iPhone — Google executives took several swipes at Apple in their on-stage remarks — analysts said Android rivals like Samsung Electronics could be the biggest victim if the Pixel takes off. Google’s strategy of licensing Android for free and profiting from embedded services such as search and maps made Android the dominant mobile operating system with some 89 percent of the global market, according to IDC. But Apple still rules the high end of the market, and Google has long been frustrated by the emergence of many variations of Android and the inconsistent experience that has produced. Pushing its own hardware will likely complicate its relationship with Android licensees, analysts said. Google kicked off the event Tuesday by touting the Google Assistant, the company’s voice-activated artificial intelligence system and its answer to Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa. The presenter showed how a customer could make a restaurant reservation with a few phrases spoken into the phone. The assistant will be embedded into the Pixel and Home products and is being positioned as the central feature in a family of integrated hardware and software products. It is one of a handful of similar assistants that are vying for supremacy as more people search the web and make purchases online using voice commands, which may eventually supplant keyboards and touchscreens as the primary means of controlling digital devices. While Google is often cited as the leader in artificial intelligence, Amazon stole a march on the company with its Alexa-powered Echo home speaker system, a surprise hit. The Home device and the Echo have many of the same features. Google’s “Daydream View” virtual reality headset, meanwhile, puts the company in competition with Facebook Inc., owner of Oculus. The device, which works with an Android phone, is far cheaper and simpler. It will be available in November for $79, in time for the end-of-year shopping season. Home will also be available in November for $129, including a six-month trial of ad-free YouTube. Google also unveiled a new version of its Chromecast digital media player and a router dubbed Google Wi-Fi, both boasting the same sleek, minimalist design as the Home product. “These look like products from a single company,” said Queiroz, the Google executive.

News & Analysis Google Does Consumer Electronics OEMs courted to embed smart assistant Rick Merritt 10/4/2016 05:15 PM EDT 2 comments NO RATINGS 1 saves Login to Rate Tweet SAN FRANCISCO – October 4 was a big day for Google, the coming out of a new OEM inside the Web search giant. It may also mark a pivot for consumer electronics to an era driven by machine-learning services running in the cloud. The company launched two smartphones, a smart speaker, a virtual reality headset and a Wi-Fi access point. Its Pixel smartphones and Home smart speaker are the containers for its machine-learning Assistant, the company’s most strategic product of all. Google is already in discussions with OEMs about embedding in their consumer electronics products the Assistant, a voice recognition and search client. The client code currently runs on a dual-core ARM Cortex-A7 with 256 Mbytes RAM and 256 Mbytes flash. The devices debuted at a press event in San Francisco’s Ghirardelli Square. Quietly surveying the noisy scene of demo booths here, we saw David Foster, the former head of Amazon’s hardware group who joined Google two days ago as head of its hardware group. Foster’s team at Lab126 was responsible for Amazon’s Kindle, Dash and Echo products. The Echo, already in a speaker-less $49 version, is well ahead of Google’s Home which won’t ship until November in a single $129 version. Two days into his new job as head of Google's hardware group, David Foster, formerly of Amazon, made a low key appearance. (Images: EE Times) In our chance encounter I asked Foster why he joined the search giant, “It’s rare to find a moment when something this big is getting started,” said Foster. “Google is at the start of a long journey here,” he added. It’s a journey that has big implications for OEMs. As Microsoft Windows did with PCs, the Web services from giants such as Amazon and Google threaten to hollow out their products as the key value-added ingredient. Interestingly, Google’s new Pixel phones will be made by HTC, the Taiwan phone maker that once led the pack of Android OEMs. AI assistants will be even more pervasive than OSes, appearing as a single service across cars, stereos, phones and more. They could spawn deep and nuanced ties with the ecosystems of the data center operators who run them. Google has been working with consumer OEMs for two years on supporting its Chromecast music devices. More recently it has started having discussions about embedding the client code for the Assistant. Engineers and product managers here declined to provide any details on who is involved in those discussions, terms of licensing the code or when third-party products might emerge. They did show home automation products such as its Nest thermostats and Philips’ Hue lights responding to commands from Home via cloud-based APIs. Scott Huffman, engineering lead for Google Assistant, previewed a software developer’s kit for it. The SDK will let developers automatically respond to commands from Home or engage in conversations through the device. The SDK will be released next year with more details about it revealed in December. With the Assistant, the company aims to “build a personal Google for everyone,” said Sundar Pichai, Google’s CEO who kicked off the press event. “We are evolving from a mobile-first to an AI-first world,” he said. It’s still early days in machine learning, Pichai added, noting stepwise progress in areas such as machine translation, text-to-speech and voice and image recognition. “One day we will notice the differences between Swiss German and German and even capture emotions,” he said.

Cheshvan 17, 5777, 11/18/2016   In today's headlines:‏ תג בכותרות MainAll NewsUS & CanadaWikiLeaks founder: A surprise is coming WikiLeaks founder: A surprise is coming WikiLeaks announces 'October surprise,' denies that it will cripple Clinton's campaign. Contact Editor Arutz Sheva Staff, 04/10/16 23:30 WikiLeaks founder Reuters WikiLeaks media organization celebrated ten years of activity during a press conference in Berlin on Tuesday, with an announcement that a new batch of documents will be released over the next two months. This batch specifically targets the US government and Google. WikiLeaks has worked to unveil the activities of businesses and governments around the world. "Our upcoming series includes significant material on war, arms, oil, Google, the U.S. elections, and myself," WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said via video link from the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, where he has been living since 2012. He also said the documents would be released before the end of the year, with the first cache coming within the week. Significant anticipation surrounded Tuesday's announcement, which was reconfigured due to "security concerns." The New York Times noted, "[the] remarks from Mr. Assange disappointed many followers of WikiLeaks in the United States, who had stayed up into the early hours hoping to hear information relevant to the presidential election." According to The Verge, "There was a lot of build-up to today's press conference, in anticipation of what had been billed as an "October surprise" that could swing the U.S. presidential election. Instead, WikiLeaks devoted most of the event to recounting its most notorious releases and refuting criticism levied against it. Assange acknowledged the anticipation of a bombshell release in a winding address to reporters, though he declined to say whether the upcoming leaks would tilt the election toward Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. "There is enormous expectation in the United States," Assange said of the forthcoming leaks. "Some of that expectation will be partly answered; but you should understand that if we're going to make a major publication in relation to the United States at a particular hour, we don't do it at 3am." Assange quashed the idea that the WikiLeaks "surprise" would cripple Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign by saying, "The idea that 'we intend to harm Hillary Clinton,' or I intend to harm Hillary Clinton, or I don't like Hillary Clinton, all those are false." "WikiLeaks has provided a unique and quite outstanding service to the people of the world," said radical anti-Zionist leftist intellectual Noam Chomsky on Tuesday, "bringing to them information that they should and deserve to have and that has been illegitimately concealed by systems of power."

Google Pixel launch: Are you ready for some Google Magic, or should we say Google Assistant? Google Pixel is the first smartphone that will come with the Google Assistant inbuilt. Written by Nandagopal Rajan | Updated: October 5, 2016 12:58 pm Google Pixel launch: Google CEO Sundar Pichai says the idea is to make a different Google, or at least Google Assistant, for each user. So what is this Google Magic that we are going to see with the new Pixel phones? The real clues on what this means came a week before in New Delhi, not in San Francisco. At the Google for India event, the search giant showcased how it has progressed on Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence, more on the former which improves the latter in the long run. Today, CEO Sundar Pichai said the machine learning has now reached accuracy level of 93.9 per cent. While suggesting that the path ahead would be tougher he said that, however, each percentage change translated into a huge experiential improvement for the user. For instance, with pictures Google can now understand more detail and context and not just the subject like before. Also, this was making translate and text to speech much more impressive and India has been one of the test labs for most of these technologies. Watch our first look of Google Pixel But what does this mean for Pixel? Well, Pixel is the first smartphone that will come with the Google Assistant inbuilt. Nothing new you might say, especially when we have had Siri for many years and Google Now for at least a couple. But yes, it is a big thing because your assistant is also an intelligent, always learning, assistant now. So over a period of time it learns how you do things and how you like things to be done. As someone who has been using Google Allo for a couple of weeks now, I am very impressed by the progress of ‘my’ assistant.

Pichai says the idea is to make a different Google, or at least Google Assistant, for each user. So my Google will be different from your Google, for over time it should be able to throw me different results from what you get. Google already does this in products like Google News, but when this comes to search things will be very different. In India, if you are in a Hindi speaking state, Google already shows you a Hindi results tab. But the Google Assistant should be able to learn that you are not a Hindi speaker and filter out those results soon enough, maybe even throwing you results in your own language. Also read | Google Pixel event: Here is everything that was announced from 4K Chromecast to Google Home Then there is the Google Home, the Wi-Fi speaker with Assistant built in. So Google will be learning about you and answering your queries when you are home too and these will be contextually aware and different what it shows on the phone. Also, the Assistant is getting partners and will be an open ecosystem. So Indian Express, for instance, will be able to send daily updates and alerts to everyone who likes our content. Or a grocery chain will be able to interact with you to check if you are out of any stuff at regular intervals and take orders. Assistant will be able to respond to direct action requests as well as conversation actions. But let’s not forget that at the end of the day Google is an advertising company too. So it would be really tough to keep the ads away. So every morning there could be an ad pop-up asking you to consider a publisher other than the Indian Express, or to try out a different grocer. With Google knowing so much about you, there is a question of how comfortable you would be with this. For instance, we already see what this can do to you online with ads following you even on the mail based on the content and context. We can just hope Google will not go for an overkill when it comes to selling ads and making money. We might, just might, put up with some of it for the sake of the convenience that is the Google Assistant. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Express TechIE Samsung Galaxy S7 Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Gionee S6 Xiaomi Mi 5 Best of Express 26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & Instagram IndiaDemonetisation: Misuse of bank account for black money deposit to invite govt action IndiaLong queues outside banks a ‘serious issue’, says SC on demonetisation BusinessUse indelible ink in banks keeping in mind upcoming bypolls: EC writes to Finance Ministry IndiaNavy rubbishes Pak Navy claim that it stopped Indian submarine from entering waters BusinessDemonetisation live updates: This is a required surgery done for a better India, says Venkaiah Naidu EntertainmentForce 2 movie review: John Abraham, Sonakshi Sinha film is Bond-Bourne rehash EntertainmentChris Martin parties with Shah Rukh Khan, Sussanne Khan and Sridevi's daughters, see inside pics EntertainmentIt's November 18, Salman Khan's wedding day, see pics EntertainmentIulia Vantur reveals what she had to sacrifice to live in India.

Kate DwyerOct 4, 2016 5:10PM EDT Facebook Twitter Pinterest Facebook Twitter Pinterest facebook dialog PinterestGoogle Is Google making iPhones now? Nope, that's the Pixel, Google's new smartphone that looks very, very similar to the iPhone 7. Except it's a lot different from the iPhone, because it runs on Android, has a home button on the back, and is basically the Googlest device ever. The Google Pixel was announced today at a keynote in San Francisco, and it's the software company's most recent foray into hardware, and its first smartphone to be Google-branded. Previously, the company released smartphones through the Nexus program, which some say is finished for good. However, because the Pixel is available in limited quantities, it's unlikely that it'll be successful with a mainstream audience. Instead, the Pixel's buyers are likely the same group of tech enthusiasts who loved the Nexus. The phones are supposedly the purest form of the Android experience, and aim to be what the iPhone is for the iOS operating system. The Pixel will be available exclusively to Verizon customers in the U.S. starting today, and will cost between $650 and $870 depending on the model. It's available in two sizes: Pixel with a 5-inch display, and Pixel XL, with a 5.5-inch display. Both are available in "very silver," "quite black," and "really blue." (Trust us, it's really blue.) As previously leaked, you can get 7 hours of battery life in 15 minutes of charging. https://twitter.com/eram1294/status/783349210477387776 Google's proudest feature on the device is the Google Assistant, which is basically a more advanced version of Siri. It taps into the Google search engine and all its plug-ins, like Maps, Flights, etc. when you ask a question. You can also use the Assistant to search through photos by location or subject, and play music. Using the Google Now feature, you can use the Assistant to search through data such as restaurant recommendations, then have it make a reservation for you, according to The Verge. It's safe to say the Pixel is the smartest smartphone ever, but whether or not that's a good thing remains to be seen. It's worth pointing out that many of the security concerns expressed over Allo, Google's new messaging app, will likely carry over to the Pixel, which comes loaded with Allo and Duo. https://twitter.com/google/status/783342911207473152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw Despite Google's claim that the phone has the best camera ever, Gizmodo reports that the camera actually isn't as good as the iPhone 7 or the Samsung Galaxy S7. At least, it's not as good in low-light settings. That said, the photography experience on the phone offers one perk you can't get anywhere else: unlimited storage on the cloud for full-resolution photos and videos. That means that once you fill up the phone's storage (or before then), you can store your photos with Google, for free, forever. The phone's display is also a selling point: even though the Pixel is smaller than the Nexus 6P, it has the same resolution, which means that the picture is sharper. Because of that sharp picture, the phone is VR-compatible with the new Google Daydream View virtual reality headset, which the company also announced today. Daydream View headsets will be available for $80 and start to ship in November. The Daydream experience is much different than the Samsung Gear VR and the Facebook Oculus Rift; like its knit-fabric device, there's something positively cozy about the interface. In terms of cases, some third party retailers like Otterbox have already announced their accessories lineup for the Pixel, but Google will manufacture Live Cases for the Pixel, much like they did for the Nexus. Live Cases are a line of customizable phone cases that transfer their designs onto the phone's wallpaper via a near-field connection (NFC). https://twitter.com/google/status/783344859268673537 So even though it looks like an iPhone, it's not an iPhone — although it could become Apple's biggest competitor.

Google maps , that is. Of course, the southern continent has always been on Google maps and its popular Google Earth application. The problem was that much of the imagery was about as sharp as the graphics in Pong, one of the earliest arcade video games. But Paul Morin and his mapmakers at the Polar Geospatial Center (PGC) at the University of Minnesota are doing all they can to change that with the cooperation of the Internet giant. Find Antarctica on Google Lake Vida Thwaites Glacier Marie Byrd Land Williams Airfield   Cape Crozier     “They’ve helped us update almost 1,000,000 square kilometers of imagery for both poles,” said Morin, principal investigator for PGC, which started in 2007 to provide high-resolution maps and satellite imagery to the U.S. Antarctic Program for research and operational purposes. More recently, PGC has added the Arctic to its mission, funded mainly by the National Science Foundation . The informal partnership took shape about a year ago, facilitated by a Google employee on sabbatical who worked a summer season at the South Pole Station’s computer help desk. Morin and his team of mostly students provide Google with a list of Antarctic regions — from the ice-free McMurdo Dry Valleys to ice shelves to subantarctic islands — that are scientifically and logistically important. “Every three months, we choose another 275,000 square kilometers,” Morin said of a continent that’s more than 14 million square kilometers, about the size of the United States and Mexico combined. “We can’t map Antarctica with 12 people. I will take help from where it will come, and Google has the right tools and the right people and the right attitude at the right time,” Morin said. “It’s just extraordinary to hand them a list of places that researchers have wanted to see for decades in Marie Byrd Land, [for example,] and it pops up in a couple of months.” A Google spokesperson said as part of the company’s efforts to ensure it has an accurate representation of the real world, it often works with third-party organizations who are on-the-ground experts to help it learn about and understand certain regions.  “In the case of Antarctica, [PGC] is one of a few organizations that help us improve our imagery and base data in the Antarctic region,” she said. “The PGC has been a valuable resource to us as we aim to provide our users with the richest, most up-to-date maps possible.” Photo Credit: ©Google, ©Digital Globe, ©GeoEye The cone of Erebus volcano on Ross Island as seen on Google maps. The imagery is a slightly lower resolution version than what PGC receives from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency . The NGA imagery is reserved for federally funded projects and agencies, according to Morin. Google licenses the imagery for public use. “A high-end glaciologist, someone doing logistics, and the 13-year-old on Google Earth in his bedroom are all on a level playing field now. That’s the extraordinary thing,” Morin said. Aerial photos taken by Navy airplanes dating back to the 1950s are also being added to Google Earth. So, for example, someone interested in Lake Bonney in the Dry Valleys can use a slide tool to travel back in time to 1957 to see how the lake level has changed over the decades. The idea is that scientists and other USAP users can employ tools like Google Earth first before seeking out even more detailed imagery and maps from PGC, according to Morin. “Google has been so incredibly helpful,” he said. PGC has acquired imagery of more than 80 percent of the polar regions, including Siberia, Canada, Greenland and subantarctic islands at half-meter resolution. That’s good enough to see individual rocks or tents on the ground. Cartographers at PGC then take those satellite snapshots and convert them into highly accurate maps, some of which have been geo-referenced with high-end GPS. “Now that we have a good picture of the continent, we’re in a good position to improve the accuracy of all of the Antarctic names,” said Morin, explaining that the majority of place names were tagged before GPS and the era of high-resolution imagery. PGC maintains a satellite office at McMurdo Station during the summer field season from October to February to provide research teams and logistics planners with imagery and maps with near-real-time capability. Meanwhile, Morin will head to the Antarctic Peninsula this year to geo-reference existing imagery to improve map accuracy. High-precision GPS will bring accuracy from being off by as much as 30 meters to less than a meter. “We start knowing where an outcrop is within a horizontal accuracy about the size of a coffee table,” he noted. “That’s what we can do when we get enough points in the right place.” The imagery is not just a useful tool for observing calving from ice shelves or for scouting a location for a field camp. Scientists are using it as a tool for research, such as monitoring penguin colonies from space based on the discoloration on snow from bird excrement or counting the number of seals clustered around a crack in sea ice. “Imagery can free biologists from working in one place,” Morin said. “We’re pretty much working with everyone directly or indirectly.” NSF-funded research in this story: Paul Morin, University of Minnesota, Award No. 1043681 .   Contact Us National Science Foundation Division of Polar Programs Geosciences Directorate 4201 Wilson Boulevard Suite 755 Arlington VA 22230 Site Information Policies and Important Links Web Accessibility Publication Schedule USAP Frequently Asked Questions Link to the USAP Portal Help and Support Feedback Form Helpful Links Search the USAP Portal USAP Program Announcements News About the USAP RSS Feeds Information for Proposers Calendars and Schedules Curator: Michael Lucibella, Antarctic Support Contract | NSF Official: Peter West, Division of Polar Programs
Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us App streaming live for some games on Google Play Store By R Padla - October 4, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter App streaming is not an alien idea. Google introduced app streaming from Google Search last year. This special feature allows a user to preview and test apps right on Google Search. This way, you can immediately know what kind of app it really is and what information it can provide. No need to directly download an app before you can say it’s relevant to your needs. App streaming reduces the time spent in downloading and testing an application. Right then and there on Search, you will know how an app works via streaming. Not all apps support streaming but there are several titles testing the technology. Google didn’t make an official announcement about the feature rolling out in the Play Store but looks like app streaming is ready although still with some errors. The app streaming in Google Play Store will be more useful for games especially those that are paid. Trials are offered for a limited time so you can see a preview of the game and even try it for ten minutes. That’s a short time of trial but enough for you to test the game before you can decide to download and pay a few cents for it. The game ‘Ticket to Ride’ appears to support app streaming. Other apps and games must have that “Try Now” reference so you’ll know the ones you can stream. App streaming isn’t perfect yet so don’t be surprised if a game suddenly crashes.

With the launch of Google Home, the company comes in direct competition with Amazon's Echo. Google Assistant, Alexa and Siri are competing to take the top stop amongst each other as more and more people search the web and get work done by giving voice commands. With Google Home, users can play songs, flip radio stations, and access favourite their playlists by giving an 'Ok Google' voice command. Music from Google Play Music, Pandora, Spotify, TuneIn, and YouTube Music are accessible through the device. > "Google Home taps into the power of Google Search to give you real-time answers to things you want to know," exclaimed Ken Mixter (from Google's software team), on a company blog post. "Ask Google Home to translate phrases and do simple math calculations," he adds. Additionally users can control other devices in the house using Google Home. They can also control the volume of the speakers with Chromecast Audio plugged in or can stream videos on the television with Chromecast connectivity. Google launches Pixel, Pixel XL smartphones, prices start at Rs 57,000 The Google Pixel starts at $649 for 32GB inbuilt storage, the Pixel XL costs $769 for 32GB and $869 for 128GB version. It sports a clean design with a capacitive touch surface, and with no buttons or hidden LED lights. The device will be available in the US starting November this year. Users can pre-order it for $129 from Google Store. Six months of YouTube Red can also be availed for free as a welcome offer. The search giant also announced Google WiFi, through which the company claims to deliver a "fast signal in every room, on every device" for users. It is an expandable system to connect one router to another in order to make WiFi signals stronger. > As per the company, the system uses a technology called mesh Wi-Fi. "Within our mesh network, each Google Wifi point creates a high-powered connection, and the different points work together to determine the best path for your data," explained Ben Brown, a senior product manager at Google Home. Users can also control Google Wi-Fi networks using a companion app available on Android and iOS. The app displays devices connected to the Wi-Fi and bandwidth used. It will be available for pre-order in the US starting November at $129 for a single pack, and $299 for a three-pack through Google Store.

Follow TechnoBuffalo As part of today’s Pixel announcement, Google also unveiled Android 7.1, which introduces, among other features, Google Assistant. This feature is the future of Google, a powerful new AI platform that allows users to “have a natural conversation with Google,” according to the search giant. Unfortunately, as you may have feared, it doesn’t appear as though Assistant will come to Google’s best ever Nexus device. While Android 7.1 will introduce new features such as Night Light (similar to Apple’s Night Shift), Daydream VR support, and more to a handful of Nexus phones, it appears the arrival of Google’s Pixel handsets also means these new devices get the best software features. That’s not entirely unexpected but it’s a huge let down for Nexus 6P owners; that device is still a perfectly good phone, especially if you don’t feel like dropping $649 for the cheapest Pixel handset. The Pixel devices will get Google’s new launcher, Google Assistant, a tech support service, and unlimited high-quality photo and video backup to Google Photos. There’s also a new Smart Storage feature that will automatically remove backed up photos and videos when your device’s storage is maxed. Finally, the Android 7.1 update also introduces a few aesthetic changes, including additional theming option and a dynamic calendar date icon. It’s unclear when the update will be available for non-Pixel devices but we should expect it to arrive over the next three or four weeks. We reached out to Google to ask about whether or not the Nexus 6P will get features such as Assistant and will update if we hear back. Update via Android Police: Below is the full Android 7.1 changelog, with some features that are specific to the Pixel phones. Pixel product-specific Pixel Launcher – swipe up for all apps, new Search Box, date/weather header on home Google Assistant Unlimited original quality photo/video backup to Google Photos Smart Storage – when storage is full, automatically removes old backed up photos/videos Phone/Chat support (new support tab in settings), screen-share functionality Quick switch adapter for wired setup from Android or iPhone Pixel Camera: Electronic Image Stabilization (“video stabilization”) 2.0 Pro Features White Balance Presets Exposure Compensation AE/AF Locking Viewfinder grid modes HW-accelerated (on Qualcomm Hexagon coprocessor) HDR+ image processing Smartburst Sensor Hub processor with tightly integrated sensors (accel, gyro, mag) + connectivity (Wi-Fi, Cell, GPS) Cosmetic Solid navbar icons with home affordance for Assistant SysUI accent color theming Wallpaper picker with new wallpapers and sounds New setup look and feel Dynamic calendar date icon Android Nougat 7.1 Night Light Touch/display performance improvements Moves (Fingerprint swipe down gesture – opt-in) Seamless A/B system updates Daydream VR mode Developer features: App shortcuts / shortcut manager APIs Circular app icons support Keyboard image insertion Fingerprint sensor gesture to open/close notification shade Manual storage manager Intent for apps Improved VR thread scheduling Enhanced wallpaper metadata Multi-endpoint call support Support for various MNO requirements PCDMA voice privacy property Source type support for Visual Voicemail Carrier config options for managing video telephony Manual storage manager – identifies apps and files and apps using storage Source TheVerge Topics #Google #Android 7.1 #Google #pixel #Pixel XL Pixel Updates 18 Google Pixel outsells Nexus 6P in first week, report claims November 3 17 Google Pixel and Pixel XL top 5 features: Google Assistant, Daydream and more!

Google’s new smartphones are about Google, not Android Posted Oct 4, 2016 by Darrell Etherington (@etherington) 0 SHARES Next Story Report: Yahoo scanned users’ email for U.S. intelligence agencies Google unveiled a lot of new devices today, but at the core of nearly everything was a commitment to Assistant specifically, and to showing off what Google’s range of service offerings can do. I sat down with Google Canada’s Head of Public Affairs Aaron Brindle after the satellite keynote event here in Toronto to discuss what hardware means for Google now, and how its work in artificial intelligence and machine learning fits in with the device side of the equation. “One of the most important messages of today is that Google is taking hardware very seriously,” Brindle said. “What we’ve seen with the Android ecosystem is that the pace of innovation there is amazing — there are now 1.4 billion daily users on Android. However, this is not about bringing the best of Android to our users — it’s about bringing the best of Google to our users. So that’s taking in all of the investments and research that we’re doing around AI and ML, and packaging it front to back in hardware.” Brindle says that while there’s plenty of great work being done by Android OEM partners, Google still sees places where it can supplement the options available to consumers. He also suggested that Google is looking at more than just the hardware and software side of being a device company — they recognize the importance of the sales and marketing experience on that side of the business, too. “The reality is that one size doesn’t fit all in the Android space, and we recognize that there is a big opportunity to create something from nuts to bolts,” he said. “Not only in the software and the hardware, but in the marketing, in the support, in the retail piece, and we felt there was something missing there.” Whether that means we’ll see full brick-and-mortar retail remains to be seen, but already Google is rethinking its web-based device sales with new installment-plan payment options for devices it sells directly via the Google Store online for over $150 in the U.S. The retail experience is part of Google’s new approach to hardware. As for how Assistant plays in, and where it gets its impressive smarts, Brindle says it’s core to the Pixel devices, and has been made possible thanks to very recent improvements in the capability of Google’s AI. “You heard the Assistant come up throughout this piece, and it is central, it is the marquee piece in the new phone,” he explained. “That is based on advances in AI — I mean tremendous advances, not just in the past year since the last Nexus phone, I mean in the past several months. Advances in translation, and image recognition, for example.” Brindle says that Google’s operation in Canada is actually a core part of these efforts, given the country’s research leadership in the field. “All of that research comes from the work that we’re doing in AI, and some of the best researchers in AI are based here in Canada,” he said. “So [Google Distinguished Researcher] Geoffrey Hinton’s work on machine learning, particularly the integration of his work on neural nets and how that has shaped our AI advances, it’s all in there.” Google’s approach is about more than just owning the phone experience end-to-end — it’s about crafting a comprehensive approach to delivering the next generation of its platform, which will be based around AI and ML and will look to devices like the Pixel and Pixel XL as perfectly suited delivery vehicles. It’s not quite a pivot, but this definitely signals a sea change in Google’s approach to its own identity and business. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Google Founded 1998 Overview Google is a multinational corporation that is specialized in internet-related services and products.

Here's how to watch live. UPDATE: Google on Tuesday unveiled its Pixel smartphones, a 4K Chromecast, an updated Wi-Fi router, and said Google Home arrives on Nov. 4 for $129. Google today is hosting a press event in San Francisco, which will likely include the launch of several devices, from new Android Nougat smartphones to a souped-up Chromecast. Things kick off at 9 a.m. PT/Noon ET, and Google will live stream the presser on YouTube (embedded below). PCMag's Tom Brant will also be there; follow along via @PCMagLive and check back to PCMag.com for hands-on takes and analysis following the event. The big reveal will be Google's new phones, which will reportedly drop the Nexus moniker in favor of Pixel. We also expect details on Google's Echo competitor, Google Home, as well as a 4K Chromecast and perhaps a new router. Until then, check out our rundown of what to expect at today's event and why PCMag's Sascha Segan isn't convinced the Pixel phones will be a game changer.

As expected, Google on Tuesday ditched the Nexus branding for its new lineup of Pixel smartphones. The aluminum unibody-glass Pixel is made by Google and is the first to tap into the Google Assistant and the Daydream VR platform the company first previewed at Google I/O. At the time, Google CEO Sundar Pichai described Assistant as something that will allow users to have "an ongoing, two-way dialog with Google." In a demo onstage here in San Francisco, Google used Assistant on the Pixel to buy concert tickets, make a restaurant reservation, and get directions all by voice. "It can help with the big things like weekend plans, but it's also good for the little things like finding information, setting reminders for yourself, and so much more," said Brian Rakowski, VP of Product Management at Google. For video chats, there's also Google Duo built in. If you need more help than Google Assistant can provide, the company built 24-7 live customer care right into the phone, accessible via phone or chat. A screen-share option also lets a Google agent see what you're seeing. Pixel comes in two sizes: 5 inches or 5.5 inches. It runs a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor and sports a high-definition AMOLED Corning Gorilla Glass 4 display. There's 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM, a fingerprint sensor, a USB-C connector and 3.5mm headphone jack, and support for Bluetooth 4.2. Rakowski boasted that the Pixel has the "best smartphone camera anyone has made." It features a 12.3MP rear-facing camera with 1.55 micron pixels and f/2.0 aperture. A smart burst feature will capture a continuous stream of images and select the "sharpest, clearest photo of just the right moment," Rakowski said. HDR+ is also turned on by default, which will reduce noise and minimize blur to produce "clear vivid pictures, even in challenging conditions," he said. The phone also processes images twice as fast ("so you can keep snapping away") and features image stabilization for less nausea-inducing video. As an added incentive, Google will provide unlimited storage for photos and video from the Pixel at full resolution, even 4K videos. VR fans can pop the Pixel into Google's new Daydream View, the first Daydream-ready headset and controller. Get it in November for $79. When it comes to battery life, Pixel will "easily" get you through your day with its 2,700mAh or 3,450 mAh battery, according to Sabrina Ellis, director of Product Management at Google. For those times when power is dwindling, Pixel owners can get seven hours worth of battery life with 15 minutes of charging, she said. Pixel ships with Android 7.0 Nougat, and Google promised system and security updates as soon as they're available. Going forward, those upgrades will be downloaded and installed in the background, so you're ready to go right away. "Gone are the days of staring at a progress bar while waiting for an update to install," Ellis said. If you're switching over from another mobile OS, Google added a new tool that will transfer contacts, photos, videos, music, texts, calendar events, and even iMessages over to the Pixel. //Related Articles The End of Google Nexus: A Look Back In the US, the Pixel is a Verizon exclusive, also available at Best Buy, though Google will also sell it unlocked on the Google Store and it will work on Project Fi. Pre-orders begin today in the US, Australia, Canada, Germany, and the UK starting at $649 or $27 per month for a 32GB device; a 128GB version is also available. Google has adopted a rather tongue-in-cheek color-naming convention for the Pixel; get it in Quite Black, Really Blue, or Very Silver. The demise of the Nexus brand, meanwhile, is the end of an era. As Google notes, it has "partnered closely with mobile handset partners around the world to bring you the best of Android" since 2010. "Through Nexus, the goal was to work with these various partners to push the boundaries of what's possible with a smartphone. We've now decided to take the next step and provide our take on the best Google experience, by bringing hardware and software design together under one roof." Also today, Google unveiled a 4K Chromecast and announced that its Home device, set to rival Amazon Echo, arrives on Nov. 4 for $129.

Google unveiled this new pair of phones, useful products for the home, and tools that will make your life easier. Google doesn't want to just live inside your desktop anymore — it wants to be integrated into all aspects of your daily life. Here's how it plans to pull that off. Google AssistantGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai kicked off today's presentation with the software that ties all of its new products together: Google Assistant. It's "a personal Google for each and every user," he said. Google's had various iterations of this technology in the past (namely, Google Now), but now it wraps all of its machine learning smarts into one voice-controlled package. Assistant, which Google announced at its I/O developer conference in May, is a bit like Siri on steroids. You can ask it questions, conversationally, and it will serve up answers from the web, from the apps on your phone, from your calendar and contacts, and more. It can send messages for you, and integrates Google Maps so you can find out more information about a destination, or how to get there. Instead of having to dig up information in half a dozen different apps, it presents what you need in one place, easily accessed by your voice. Advertisement Photo: Courtesy Verizon. Pixel And perhaps the day's biggest announcement, the Google Pixel, is centered around that Google Assistant experience. Like Siri on the iPhone, you access it with a long press of the home button, or through a key phrase ("Okay Google"). When you're in a thread with the Assistant, you can swipe upwards from the bottom of the phone to get more contextual information about what you're talking about, such as directions to a restaurant. This is the first phone Google built 100% on its own, and the company made multiple jabs at how it's better than the iPhone: It doesn't have an "unsightly camera bump," for example, and thanks to unlimited, free remote storage, you'll never get one of those "storage full" pop-ups again. The latter alone sounds like bliss, but there's a lot more that makes this phone something to be excited about. Available in 5-inch and 5.5-inch varieties, one of the phones's biggest selling points is its 12.3-megapixel camera, which, according to the camera analysts at DXOMark, is the highest-rated smartphone camera, ever (it scored three points higher than the iPhone 7). Features include an f/2.0 aperture lens; a smart burst feature for capturing action shots and selecting the best, clearest image; and HDR+, which is designed to provide clear, vivid pictures in even the most challenging situations, reducing blur and minimizing noise, too. It's also got image stabilization, so videos don't come out shaky, and incredibly fast shutter speed, so you don't miss any shots waiting for the camera to load. And, as we mentioned before, the phone comes with free remote storage so you can take as many photos as you want. Other notable features include fast charging, which gives you seven hours of battery life after just 15 minutes of being plugged in, Google's new video-calling app, Duo, built-in, and a tool that automatically transfers everything from your iPhone to this phone so you don't lose a single app, photo, or iMessage. It's available for pre-order now, with a price tag of $649 unlocked, or $27/month on Verizon. Photo: Courtesy Google. Daydream ViewA Google event wouldn't be complete without talking about VR, though. Daydream is the company's mobile-friendly VR platform, and the Pixel is the first phone that will be Daydream-ready. But for watching that VR content, you need a headset: The DayDream View, which will begin shipping in November for $79. Unlike other headsets, it's not inspired by gadgets, but rather what people actually wear. Thus, it's encased in soft, flexible, breathable fabric. It's completely wireless, and comes with a small remote control that stores neatly inside the headset when not in use. (This remote is how you interact on-screen with your virtual world, like a Wii controller.) You'll be able to watch content from more than 50 partners including Netflix, Hulu, and HBO on the Daydream View, as well as Google Play Movies, YouTube, and Street View. You'll also be able to get a cool, exclusive Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them VR experience that lets you virtually become a wizard in J.K. Rowling's fictional world. Google Wi-Fi & Google Chromecast UltraFor your home, Google introduced three new products, including a small home router called Google Wi-Fi, and a new living room dongle for streaming content from your phone (and other sources), the Chromecast Ultra. Google Wi-Fi goes up for pre-order this November for $129. The goal is that you can use this device to ensure solid, even Wi-Fi coverage throughout your home. In conjunction with an app, it can intelligently resolve issues when they crop up, or let you control who has access to the network. Chromecast Ultra is one of the smallest and cheapest set top box-type devices out there. You plug the $69 dongle into your TV, and it lets you stream whatever's on your iPhone or Android phone to the set. It also gives you access to hundreds of apps, TV shows, games, and more, basically turning any old TV into a smart TV for a fraction of the cost. What makes it Ultra is that now you can stream content in 4K. Advertisement Photo: Courtesy Google. Google HomeGoogle finished off the day giving us a better look at Google Home, its answer to the Amazon Echo. Google Home has a speaker in its base so you can play music, and you can swap it out with one of six color combinations to match your home decor. With Google Assistant smarts inside, you can speak to it, asking questions, or use the device to manage your every day tasks and control other devices in your home. One useful feature is called My Day, which, like the president's daily briefing, gives you an overview of your day, from the weather and traffic, to upcoming appointments and reminders. If you've got multiple devices in the house "listening" for that "Okay Google" command, it's context-aware and will figure out whether the question is best answered by Google Home, or your phone. And if you're creeped out by a device listening in all the time, it has a mute button that turns off its listening capabilities. It's available for pre-order starting today for $129, and ships November 4.

Google’s Daydream VR Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau gets shoutout during Google’s Pixel keynote Pixel and Pixel XL Hands-on: Say goodbye to Nexus Patrick O'Rourke October 4, 2016 4:49pm Prior to the Pixel and Pixel XL’s official reveal, we knew almost everything about the Google’s upcoming phone, including its sleek iPhone-like industrial design and various technical specifications — thanks in part to leaks from a number of U.S. carriers, as well as telecoms here north of the wall. Actually going hands-on with the new handset at Google’s Toronto event, however, gave us a view into just how much effort the tech giant has put into what it calls an “evolution” of its longstanding Nexus brand. With the Pixel, Google is clearly vying to compete with Apple in the high-end smartphone market. My most important takeaway from going hands-on with the Pixel and Pixel XL is Google’s pair of new phones are by far the most refined Android devices on the market, though they don’t feature the unique look of Samsung’s Note 7. Google’s new phone comes in two sizes: a 5-inch model with a 1920 x 1080 pixel display and a 5.5-inch XL edition with a 2560 x 1440 pixel screen. Pricing starts at a pricey $899 for the Pixel and $1,049 for the Pixel XL — yet another sign the company aims to go head-to-head with Apple. The end result is a phone that features fast components inside and a sleek fit and finish on the outside. It also doesn’t feel as angular or tech-oriented as other Android devices, opting for a rounded look that will likely appeal to a wider demographic. The Pixel’s Gorilla Glass subtly curves around the phone’s sides and its OLED display feels bright and responsive. And yes, Google’s new smartphone also includes a 3.5mm headphone jack. While the Pixel looks similar to the iPhone, there are major differences between the two devices in terms of aesthetics. For instance, on the Pixel the fingerprint sensor is located on the back of the device. Its rear-facing camera also doesn’t jut out from the back of the phone, a fact Google made sure to emphasise during the keynote. The phone’s curvature, which is more angled at the back, is also reminiscent of various HTC handsets, particularly the HTC 10. This makes sense: despite the company’s best efforts to give the opposite impression, it’s not actually manufacturing the Pixel. Instead, Google has contracted HTC to make the two new Pixel devices. Google, however, is quick to point out that despite the fact that HTC is manufacturing the Pixel, the Taiwanese OEM didn’t design the smartphone. Unlike the Nexus line, the Pixel is created by Google from the ground up, both in terms of software and look, a level of control the tech giant has never had over one of its smartphones before. The end result is software that feels faster and smoother, though I have admittedly only spent a brief amount of time with the phone. This swiftness could also be the result of the Pixel’s Snapdragon 821 processor and 4GB of RAM, though further testing is definitely required. In terms of the Pixel’s camera package, Google boasted in its keynote that DxOMark has given the Pixel’s camera its highest ever mobile score, coming in at 89. In my brief hands-on time in the poorly lit venue where Google held its Toronto event, the Pixel’s shooter performed admirably. Unlimited Google Photos storage at original quality for all Pixel owners is also a welcome bonus. It’s worth noting, that neither the Pixel or Pixel XL features image stabilization, though Google says that the phone’s gyroscope is linked to its camera system. The Pixel also only features one speaker on its base instead of two, a downside if you consider the phone the first Daydream-ready VR device. Finally, it’s notable that the Pixel does not run stock Android like its older Nexus brothers. Instead, it utilizes a custom launcher with a dedicated button that places Google searches on the top beside time and weather. A long-press launches new circular icons that allow users to quickly jump to different items and you can also slide up from the application drawer and slide down to access the notification drawer. A long-press on the home button also launches Google Assistant, the company’s new built-in concierge. Google claims the personal assistant is able to intelligently answer follow-up questions when making various queries. For example, you could say, “Ok Google, where is the nearest cafe?” then follow up this question by making an appointment at the nearby coffee shop. Other specs include a 2,770mAh battery in the Pixel and a 3,450mAh power source in the Pixel XL. Internal storage measures in at either 32GB or 128GB. There’s also a USB-C port there. In Canada, the phone will available in either silver or black. Unfortunately, the ‘Really Blue’ model won’t be available here. It’s hard to pass judgment on Google’s impressive-looking smartphone after only spending a few minutes using the device, but I’m certainly pleased with what I’ve experienced so far. This really could be the ultimate Android device fans of Google’s operating system have been waiting for. The Pixel and Pixel XL are currently available to pre-order with an October 20th launch date. The 32GB Pixel XL is priced at $1,049 with the 32GB Pixel coming in at $899. The 128GB iteration of both devices costs $1029 for the Pixel and $1179 for the Pixel XL. Google’s custom Live Cases, which are set to be priced at $50, are also set to make there way to Canada.

Can’t Fix Stupid Not sure why they are bothering with these anymore. Smanny I have to admit it’s a lot of money. However there are a number of things Patrick never mentioned about these devices. For instance the Gear VR has very fast and high accuracy sensors used for VR. Whereas these Pixel phones have very fast and very accurate sensors (accelerometers, gyroscopes) built into the Pixel phones. That is why Google’s Daydream VR headset is cheaper than Samsung’s Gear VR, plus Google’s comes with a controller. Samsung’s you have to pay extra for their controller. Plus the Pixels Daydream VR is using the new Android 7 Vulkan graphics APIs, which can be up to 3 times faster in some cases compared to OpenGL 3.1. Android still supports OpenGL of course, but if you want to take advantage of the graphics speed, then developers would use the new Vulkan Graphics APIs. Orage42 Buy it next year when they bring the Pixel 2 out. If they’re serious with competing Apple’s model, Google will still be selling previous generations at a discount. Truth is, a one year-old Pixel will outperform a brand new mid-spec’ed Nexus and they’d be at similar price points anyways. The downside to this model is that you need more than one generation of devices for it to make sense, which we don’t because they simultaneously killed the Nexus line while bringing in the Pixels. In a sense, they had to, but now we have to give it another year or two for it to all make sense. Gurjot Mand How about google on tap? SInce long pressing the middle now brings up google assistant, Can you still use google on tap somehow? But it looks like a great phone Bruno Ribeiro Yes. Long press and then swipe up. Gurjot Mand I see Thank you! JTon I believe that’s our old friend Daniel in the pic Tim3Tripp3r Good eyes, that’s what I was thinking as well. Igor Bonifacic Easter egg. 😉 Ipse How come Koodo lists the Pixel at 800CAD and XL at 950CAD? No matter…ridiculous prices for HTC sh!tty phones. Good luck promoting your “premium” brand Goobble. ChrisPollard77 Nexus is dead … I’ll be surprised if Pixel isn’t stillborn. Yep, really, REALLY happy with my OnePlus 3 right now. Hmmm … guess this means stock Android is dead as well! (Also remains to be seen if folks will be able to unlock/flash/mod the Pixels, the way they were used to on the Nexus. I only heard mention of CARRIER unlocked versions … not bootloader unlocked.) Can’t Fix Stupid Pixel is about where Project Aura ended up. I’m happy enough to pick off a fast depreciating flagship and use for a few years. Pretty happy right now with my G4 and zero reason to upgrade. Considering resale on the G4 is $300 at best and this is $1000 out the door for the base phone. I don’t see $700 of value. Smanny These Pixels are bringing a bunch of new technologies not even offered on OnePlus 3. Besides the OnePlus devices use a forked version of Android. They use Oxygen OS or Cyanogen. Plus they can’t use Daydream VR. And OnePlus 3 camera is not as good as the Pixels. ActivesiN yeah at that price I think I’ll just stick to my Nexus 5X JohnSmith1993 I had some buyers’ regret when I bought the N5x last November, but Nougat has made the phone enjoyable to use; I almost like it as much as the Nexus 5. Too bad it took ten months. mxmgodin “The Pixel also only features one speaker on its base instead of two, a downside if you consider the phone the first Daydream-ready VR device.” VR works better with headphones anyway, as it allows for better 3D sound positioning/binaural effect. Ron Of course Canada doesn’t get the blue colour. Third-world nation up here the way we miss out. Can’t Fix Stupid No blue, but we get the high price. That’s gotta count for something. Ron Yes we do feel special about that. Mr Dog It’s the same price Jack Gueorguiev Nope. $899 Mr Dog ok less than $50 more than the US price. Go get one from the US then. Lil’ Cwyin’ PC Fanboi Third-world…? Maybe you should move to Syria. Mr_Smoosh I was so looking forward to an great htc phone with regular android updates. I just don’t see the $1000 worth of phone here. Also, Koodo only lists the 32gb version, priced exactly same as iphone 7 32gb versions (XL equating to plus as well). No thanks, google. Miles Harbord I was in the same mind set until I saw the camera review… better than the iPhone. I don’t believe it’s worth paying more than the iPhone, but once they do their first discount it may be a worthwhile option. Scott Belbin you can get the 128gb version with koodo online only via there web site! Mr_Smoosh I noticed that after posting, you are correct. Price is also the same as apple counterparts (plus size). As much as I dislike apple, the only phone I’d consider paying apple prices for is an apple due to support times, value retention etc. Android ecosystem is way too flaky to be forking out premium dollars on. FlipFlopcarrot Looks ugly version of Iphone from the outside but probably better than other competitors in regards to specs and performance. BovineTipper I just… don’t get the hype. It’s like a nexus without stock android, plus a crazy price. Nothing about this seems industry leading to me. monsterduc1000 $900, forget it. Brand new Lg g5 for $530 from Exapnsys on the way!!! 🙂 Rich002 This is not going to compete with the Galaxy S7 Edge, albeit the camera is slightly higher ranked by DXOMark. Yes, it may be better than an iPhone 7, but those users are locked into their own ecosystems and they’re not going to switch. Disappointing. Google doesn’t seem to know what part of the market to target and seemed to ‘lose the plot’ after the successful Nexus 5. JCFan1979 I see they’ve also copied Apple for most idiotic placement of a camera module. The edges are where you want to hold the phone. Now just like the iPhone you’ll have to hold it weird to not put your finger in every frame. Way to go! canucks4life Nice candid shot of Daniel Bader there…miss that guy 😉 Kül Tigin Goodbye Nexus 🙁 Say goodbye to Nexus users Google. jay for that price i buy a note 7 Miles Harbord boom redheadednomad Ironic comment, given its battery issues 🙂 Not for you I quite like the look of these – good job with the photography. The silver/white combo might even tempt me to buy a white phone for the first time. How slippery are they, especially compared to a HTC 10 (or M*) phone? Patrick O’Rourke Thanks, I’m glad you liked the photos. I didn’t find the phone slippery at all. Ipse Speaking of photography…NO OIS? In this day and age? At a 1000$ price point? I know DxO gave it a score of 89 (S7Edge got 88 in Feb) but even their biased review notes judder and video blur plus AF misses. Wow. Omineca Little boxes, little boxes…. you know how the song goes. Smartphones are conformist and boring these days. They’re all the same. Apparently, that’s what the people want. tacoma Yet another new smart phone that look like all other smart phones introduced into a totally saturated market. Who cares? Folks who have time to waste, money to burn, gadgets to addict, tech to chase. Zbiba What are you doing on this website lol Barry Harden Seriously, Google needs to stop focusing on Apple and just do what it does best: Google. simbob I like the phones, nice design, great camera … But I feel like the main seling points (Google asistant, on tap, other google services…) are irelevant to me. In Quebec, vocal recognition never work unless you speak in a weird “french” accent and It can’t be set to recognise 2 languages. I honestly never heard or saw anyone use a vocal assistant here, unless it was in a joke setting with siri. Most of the sevices demonstrated in the keynote to reserve a table, book tickets, call an UBER aren’t availlable for most cities so it’s kinda pointless. Mobile technology is becoming less and less relevant to me and I would gladly trade 3 hours battery time for an assistant that I’m unlikelly to use. Pingback: Pixel and Pixel XL hands-on: Say goodbye to Nexus | nrt3() leDerp Well hello Oneplus3, old friend. It seems i will be doing business with you WhiteHorse So much for the value proposition of the Nexus line. I guess we know why they re-branded. somethingcr3ative Great article! Just wondering, how would you say the screen compares to the Samsung flagships? Lil’ Cwyin’ PC Fanboi These here Pixels have piqued my interest (like that?) but they couldn’t match Apple’s fine line of devices, now could they…? Abel “(…)Live Cases (…) are also set to make there way to Canada.” Hmm, wouldn’t it be more (geographically, at least) accurate to say “make *here* way to Canada”? 🙂 When are people going to learn the difference between “there”, “their” and “they’re”? Martin Rayner Probably around the same time as they figure out the difference between “it’s” and “its” and “your” and “you’re”. But then, as I’ve been told by innumerable self-righteously ignorant morons on the Internet, “grammar doesn’t matter” and we should just “get over it”. whatever Welcome to the real price of high end phones. Everyone here bitched about the cost of Microsoft offerings and now they are do9ing the same for google. there will be people who buy this device. The question is will there be enough or is this the final curtain for HTC monsterduc1000 Final Curtain. Might get decent contract “sales” through carriers, but direct sales are going to be terrible. Me Ted That depends on how many of us have grandfathered plans though. Some of us are only paying $55-$60/mth for plans that are now $100-$115/mth. Even at $1000, we’re going to save ~=$400 over the 24 months. thereasoner I wanted unlocked so I ordered from the PlayStore. That and I didn’t want to use my 2 year upgrade coming up on my GS6 so I can still get another phone next year if I really want one. I’m excited for these Pixel devices though, I’m glad that Google is going in a different direction now with the best specs available, more up to date software, premium builds and exclusive features. It’s the only flagships besides Samsungs that I found desirable this year. Crim Looking good, though a little on the pricey side. Hmmm… I too will stick with my Nexus 5X, though I probably will pick up the Pixel or Pixel XL someday. tvguy Say goodbye to reasonable prices! I’ll stick with my v10! Jason Hills can’t accord it. Will stick eith my G4. Harley Davis ‘It’s ok little buddy, we’re gonna be together for a whooooole lot longer’ I say as I pet my Nexus 6P fondly Lil’ Cwyin’ PC Fanboi How come folks only mention the ‘caulk lines’ when it’s an Apple product…? Orage42 Look folks, Google had to start fresh if they wanted to compete with Apple and finally give Android what it always deserved – A premium line of devices that will be fully supported, built and instantly updated by Google itself. I’m certainly sad to see the beloved Nexus line go (although, when you look at it, it was really just a testing ground with no vision, changing manufacturer, specs and screen size every single year). Now that the industry has reached the inevitable conclusion that people either want a ~5in or ~5.5in phone, it was time to step it up. Because this is a “transition” year between Nexus and Pixel, pricing seems a little out of whack. But in a few years, I can bet Google will still offer previous generation Pixels at a discount, just like Apple does. For comparison, at this very moment, they have the iPhone 7, the 6S and the SE, all at very different price tags, but they are all running the exact same iOS. Even the most popular Android line, the Galaxies, are no where near this seamless. Sure you can still buy a discounted S6 or Edge or the Note 5, but they are all running different versions of the OS. It’s a joke and about time Google steps up and does something about it. I guess we’ll only know next year when they launch the Pixel 2s (for all I care, they should copy Apple again and simply do a spec bump and call it the 1S). I sure as hell hope Google’s vision is to seriously compete with Apple’s model. theycallmeWat? Well said and I hope their vision is the same too. Only problem is that not everyone who buys a Pixel or Pixel XL will get instant system updates from Google. Apparently those in the US who buy through Verizon (exclusive carrier in the US) will have to wait until Verizon pushes out the system updates, although monthly security updates will still be pushed out to users by Google. Will be interesting when Google releases it’s first system update for these two phones and those who bought from Verizon have to wait while others have it right away (this is not the Apple model). Haven’t read/heard anything yet about whether this will be the same with carriers in other countries – hopefully it’s not. Balls O’Steele Ridiculous prices. For the same price there’s the S7 with a bigger battery, waterproofing, and wireless charging. Price will drop $150 by Cyber Monday. monsterduc1000 Just talked to Telus after they sent me an email for $100 of the Pixel with a pre-order, $100 in Google Play credits, $65 Premium Plus plan (their minimum plan though…) if you add a line. The best plan they could offer that was comparable to my current incedible grandfathered in plan (6gb, ten faves, $58/month) and adding my wife with her aging Iphone 5s with 16gb (10gb after OS space) and her BYOD $65, 2gb, Nationwide plan ended up being $165 with both of us paying $50 each for Nationwide and $65 for 7gb. Not Bad, but still $42 more a month than what we pay now (see below). BUT, she wants a shiny new Iphone herself soooooo adding that to the equation bumped the plan up to $75 each for Nationwide… Thus making the whole plan $215/month… So, our plans together now are $123/month without taxes added in yet, and in total include 8gb, Nationwide and Ten Faves… and being the cheap pr!ck I am, I will certainly pass on this “deal”… Can’t wait for my LG G5 to ship and to snag an Iphone 6 for the wife and keep our plans 🙂 Iz3man It’s a sad day indeed.. And I just started fully embrace the Nexus line. I don’t like the name, the shape, that “ugly two tone what the hell is the designer smoking thinking this would look good” back. My prediction, pixel will exist for 2 generations (this and one other) before it’s not worth pursuing anymore. Then in 2018 we will either see the death of Google hardware or resurrection of the nexus, Nexus Phoenix.. Think about, awesome name. letsGetItRight A camera with f/2.0? Are you kidding me? That’s slow for a flagship! Next phone either Samsung or Apple. This phone looks ugly! Looks like I paid less than $400 for it. No thanks. HDLuffy wow no wireless charging even with that half glass back? whats the point then? plus no water proof no SD card. No buy. Jesse Seems nice…. but not even close to being on Par with an iPhone price wise. i left the Apple fold because of the skyrocketing price. (iPhone 7? or 2005 Honda Civic with 190,000KM?) amoung other things. But this is absolutely ridiculous. 400 bucks on a 2 year contract? 1,000 outright? absolutely not. i got my LG G4 on a 2 year plan for $220 in July 2015… now every new phone is 400 bucks on a 2 year contract…. what the hell is happening!?!?!?! i’ll never buy a brand new phone on a plan again!

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau gets shoutout during Google’s Pixel keynote Jessica Vomiero October 4, 2016 5:10pm While demonstrating Google Assistant during his company’s Pixel keynote, Google CEO Sundar Pichai repeatedly mentioned Canada’s leader in his keynote. With the intention of showing how the Google Assistant uses a knowledge graph of Google search results to answer questions, Pichai asked the Assistant to name the Prime Minister of Canada. It promptly responded, “Justin Trudeau.” Google Search runs on a knowledge graph equipped with over 70 billion facts and growing. Pichai claims that — armed with Google Search — Assistant is potentially the smartest virtual assistant in existence today. Google Assistant is also compatible with Google Home, Google’s new apps Allo and Duo, and will soon be coming to several third party partners.

Shawn Douglas Maybe he will resign and go work for Google. MrQ Blessing in disguise for Canada It’s Me They don’t tend to hire bimbos. Guess he could model their phones for them. Drena Must confess, Assistant is fun to “chat” with and ask questions. If only I could give it a nickname… Ipse I thought ( together with 90% of Americans) that the prime minister of Canada was Jean Poutine. Maybe the assistant needs to watch the Ricky Mercer shows. Unorthodox And how exactly it suppose to impress me, or make buy their new phone?

But perhaps more importantly, it shores up Google’s software sovereignty—and its AI future Adrian Lee October 4, 2016 Follow @AdrianKLee Twitter Facebook Google+ Share LinkedIn Reddit Email   Rick Osterloh, SVP Hardware at Google, introduces the Pixel Phone by Google during the presentation of new Google hardware in San Francisco, California, U.S. October 4, 2016. (Beck Diefenbach/Reuters) It was a barely kept secret, with spec details flying out through a cottage industry of insiders and leaks. A glitzy tech event in a California venue—a restored chocolate factory—was live-streamed across the world. An army of tech writers picked apart and reviewed the performance of each of its parts upon its buzzy release. If all this feels familiar—a launch event for a smartphone—it’s because it is. Maybe as recently as Sept. 7, when Apple launched its iPhone 7. But for Google, a massive company that has largely treated hardware as a hobby, it’s relatively new ground. “We’re really excited for the worst-kept secret ever,” said Darren Seefried, Google Canada’s head of hardware partnerships, to laughter at a launch event in Toronto. And on a day that Google had been heralding as a major announcement—the reveal of the Google Pixel, its first true incursion into the smartphone market—the spectre of the company it’s hoping to send a shot across the bow was hard to miss. But there was one thing that made it starkly different from an iPhone launch: On a day a new phone was announced, the phone wasn’t really the star of the show. It was the shift to AI. First, the day’s superficial news itself: after occasional flirtations, Google is plunging fully into the hardware world, and there are a lot of new devices, albeit fewer for Canadians. Google is entering the virtual-reality field with a comfortable, breathable headset, the Google Daydream VR, with promises of partners like J.K. Rowling and The New York Times. It announced Google WiFi, routers set to improve internet connectivity across all corners of your home. Its device-to-TV streaming Chromecast—which Google found enjoyed a 160 per cent increase in overall watch time last year—gets an upgrade, providing 4K resolution with higher speeds, coming later this year. Google Home, an Amazon Echo replica, is a speaker with Google Assistant built-in, integrated with your home systems and your pre-existing Google devices (though this won’t be available in Canada for the foreseeable future.) But no hardware news was louder than the Google Pixel, a “made by Google” phone and its foray into the premium smartphone market. There were the typical boasts: It preened about its battery life, promising a quick-charge ability that provides 7 hours of battery life in just 15 minutes. Leading camera analyzer DXOMark gave the Pixel’s 12.3 MP-resolution camera an 89 rating—the highest-ever for a smartphone. Pixel purchasers will get unlimited Google cloud storage to store those big, high-res photos and videos. It will be widely sold by carriers like Bell and Rogers (which owns Maclean’s) starting Oct. 20. On its surface, it’s hard not to read the release of a premium Android phone as anything but a strike at Apple and its marquee iPhone. Throughout the launch, Google embraced that attitude, too, with more than a few pinches of salt: “There’s no unsightly camera bump,” pointedly noted Rick Osterloh, Google’s SVP of hardware, at one point. Later, boasting of Pixel’s unlimited cloud storage, a “Storage Full” pop-up in Apple’s trademark bubble appeared on screen. Later still, there was Google’s exultation about “a headphone jack,” actually listed as a Pixel feature, in the wake of Apple’s divisive decision to scrap it from the iPhone 7. And then there was Osterloh’s grand statement about Google’s “magic”: “The next big innovation is going to be at the intersection of hardware and software, with AI at the centre,” he said. And if that sounds familiar, it’s because Apple’s been talking about this for some time: “The magic of Apple, from a product point of view, happens at this intersection of hardware, software, and services. It’s that intersection,” said Apple chief Tim Cook, in a 2015 interview with Fast Company. And that competitive jockeying with Apple can be true and real. After all, tech watchers have long surmised that only Google could mount a truly meaningful rivalry against Apple in an already crowded marketplace. But what really makes Pixel’s launch interesting is what this really means: In a world where the currency is increasingly data, rather than coin, Google’s hardware play is a Trojan horse—even if it is a beautiful one. It’s a move into making hardware that bolsters its bread-and-butter software, allows it to further integrate itself in our daily lives, and positions it to win the fight that probably matters more, long-term: over artificial intelligence and the machine-learning algorithms that power it. South Korean professional Go player Lee Sedol reviews the match after finishing the final match of the Google DeepMind Challenge Match against Google’s artificial intelligence program, AlphaGo, in Seoul, South Korea, Tuesday, March 15, 2016. Google’s Go-playing computer program again defeated its human opponent in a final match on Tuesday that sealed its 4:1 victory. (Lee Jin-man/AP) Google has long been using machine learning to improve its services. It’s how Google Images knows what pictures to spit out when you type things in—something it’s improved at in the last two years, from 89.6 to 93.9 per cent accuracy. It’s how they’ve managed to improve machine translation to the point that it’s approaching human accuracy. It’s how Google’s AlphaGo beat the world’s best human Go player in March. It’s how Google is getting better at knowing what individual users want, based on the data they create by how they use their apps. To do all that, high-powered computers use machine learning, sifting through immense amounts of data to find patterns and learn. Users provide this data to Google through their searches and their activity across their many apps—Mail, Maps, Play, YouTube, and so on. And more data—along with better computing—refines AI and more advanced deep-learning systems. As Geoffrey Hinton, the Canadian godfather of deep learning-algorithms, said in an interview with Maclean’s: “In deep learning, the algorithms we use now are versions of the algorithms we were developing in the 1980s, the 1990s. People were very optimistic about them, but it turns out they didn’t work too well. Now we know the reason is they didn’t work too well is that we didn’t have powerful enough computers, we didn’t have enough data sets to train them.” Imagine the pace of Google’s AI development if it had even more directed information—with a phone that learns verbal cues and textual instructions, and takes detailed photos uploaded to an infinite bank of data, in the hands of many people? MORE: What is deep learning? So it was telling that Google’s Oct. 4 event started not with what consumers would invariably see as the major announcement—the new Pixel—but with new exultations over Google Assistant improvements. “We’re building hardware with the Google Assistant at its core,” said Sundar Pinchai, Google Inc.’s CEO, and indeed, the Pixel is the first phone with Assistant built in. That matters because Google’s presentation made clear that it envisions a world where you use Assistant’s vocal commands in lieu of text search, and is the big push for its Google Home, which even lets you automate home functions with verbal cues. In effect, the Pixel is a way for Google’s neural networks to gain even more insight into what people want and how they behave, information that benefits Google tremendously in its software development. That’s really where the Pixel comes in, and why Google is doing this now: Google Pixel allows an IV drip to further fuel the AI beast. This is hardware in the service of software. And a phone, to that end, makes eminent sense: In 2015, 68 per cent of Canadians owned a smartphone, and according to a 2014 report, of the 33 hours a month Canadians spend online, 49 per cent of that was spent on mobile devices, on  average. These numbers are sure to have risen today, proving that our phones are integrated deeply into the warp and weft of our lives. Putting a Google phone running Google products in people’s hands allows Google direct access to more data than ever before—an immense boon to the real prize, data sets for deep learning. As a bonus, it will get to claim that the Pixel is a true “Google phone”; if the iPhone is, for many, the product that defines Apple as a whole for consumers, a phone promising to be made entirely by Google allows the Pixel phone, conjuring emotional attachments every day, to reflect back on the company at large. But for a device that’s “all about control” for Google, according to Google Canada’s Seefried, the Pixel isn’t actually truly “made by Google,” as the company has crowed in its launch hashtag and website; while it controls design, it has farmed out the manufacturing to HTC. But those are small potatoes. Today isn’t about hardware vs. software, or even a new smartphone. Focusing on the Pixel would be missing the forest from the trees, confusing a short-term play for a long-term mission. Pinchai acknowledged it himself: “We’re moving from a mobile-first world, to an AI-first world.” It’s little wonder, then, that Google scheduled the event for Oct. 4. Sure, there’s the symbolism that its Assistant is jockeying against Apple’s Siri assistant, publicly released exactly five years ago. It could also be because, on this Oct. 4, Google was saying 10-4—radio language for “understood.” Google understands. And it’s hoping the Pixel allows its users to help them get more understanding.

And if that wasn’t enough, Google CEO Sundar Pichai also used the event to reiterate his vision of artificial intelligence as the key technology that will tie all those devices together, and allow everyone to access their personal version of Google. Here are all the key announcements of Tuesday’s event: Pixel Phone. Google has long partnered with phone manufacturers to produce its own, co-branded phones under the Nexus label. This year, Google is going one step further with the introduction of a new flagship phone that doesn’t come with any manufacturer branding. Instead, it’s “made by Google,” as the tag line reads, with the clear intent to present a device that’s as tied to Google’s identity as the iPhone is to Apple’s. Spec-wise, the Pixel phone is clearly a flagship device, with a fast quad-core processor, 4GB of RAM and up to 128 GB of storage. But you won’t hear Google emphasize those numbers. Instead, the company is pointing towards the camera as a key differentiator, with Google VP of product management Brian Rakowski telling journalists Tuesday that it is “the best smart phone camera anyone has ever made.” To drive home that point, Google is also giving every Pixel owner unlimited free cloud storage for full-resolution photos and 4K videos. The Pixel Phone comes in two screen sizes, 5 and 5.5 inches, and is available for pre-order now on Google’s website for $649 and up, with devices shipping on October 20. It’s also being sold as a carrier exclusive to Verizon customers.   Related Google Officially Introduces Google Home, a $129, Smart, Wi-Fi-Powered Speaker Google Home. This is essentially Google’s answer to Amazon’s Echo speaker, albeit with a bunch of additional capabilities. Not only does it work in conjunction with Google services like the company’s calendar, but it also connects to consumers’ existing Chromecast streaming adapters, essentially becoming voice control for audio and video streaming in the home. Google Home costs $129, and will come to retail stores in early November. Chromecast Ultra. Google introduced a new 4K version of its popular Chromecast streaming stick Tuesday. Chromecast Ultra, as the device is being called, looks pretty much like the existing Chromecast, but is capable of 4K and HDR streaming to TVs that support it. And because 4K does use a lot of bandwidth, Chromecast Ultra also comes with an Ethernet port that’s integrated into the device’s power adapter — it’s basically like the Ethernet adapter that Google has been selling separately for its existing Chromecast adapters. Chromecast Ultra costs $69, and will come to stores and Google’s online store in November. Related Google Officially Unveils Daydream View Headset for Mobile Virtual Reality Daydream View. Google’s new phones are the first devices to support the company’s new mobile virtual reality technology dubbed Daydream, which has been baked into the latest version of Android. But to actually use Daydream, you’ll also need a headset like this one. Daydream View is functionally similar to Samsung’s Gear VR in that it uses a phone as a display, but otherwise, the two headsets couldn’t be any more different. Google’s version is covered with soft fabric and feels light and comfortable to wear without ever giving you the impression that you got a big piece of plastic strapped to your face. Daydream also comes with a small external clicker remote that has a few buttons as well as a touch pad, which helps to play VR games and navigate through menus while using the headset. Daydream View costs $79, and will start shipping in early November. Google Wifi. Google has made routers before, but this one is different: The company’s now router, simply called “Google Wifi,” can be used to blanket big homes or old houses with thick stucco walls with wireless internet, thanks to the capability to combine multiple routers to cover every single spot. This is how companies have been using wireless internet for a long time, but now, Google is giving it a home networking twist: Consumers will be able to prioritize individual devices, and even turn off their children’s internet access when it’s time for homework. Google Wifi is using many of the same tech that Google has pioneered with its OnHub routers, and users will be able to add a Google Wifi router to extend the reach of an existing home network powered by OnHub. Google Wifi costs $129, with three units selling for $299, and will be available for pre-order in November. Google Assistant. This one you actually won’t be able to buy — or not on its own, anyway. Google has long worked on making information discovery more personal, and this work now culminates in the Assistant as a kind of personal helper. Think Siri or Alexa, if you will, but made by Google. Google CEO Sundar Pichai took the unusual step of opening Tuesday’s big hardware unveil with a talk on the Assistant and the technology that powers it, saying that the ultimate goal was to “build each user his or her own personal Google.” A lot of that involved technical advancements in fields like machine translation and image recognition, he explained. But in the end, only practice makes perfect. “It’s equally important to get the assistant into the hands of our users,” said Pichai. “And that’s what we are doing today.” Google’s Assistant is what’s powering many of the voice interactions with Google Home, and buyers of Google’s new Pixel phones will also have direct access to the assistant.

For this generation, Google nixes the familiar Nexus name, along with the cluttered and confused Nexus model numbering system, replacing it with the newer Pixel moniker and creating a unified hardware family that also includes the existing Chromebook Pixel notebook and Pixel C tablet. Despite early rumors that Huawei would manufacture the new Pixel phones, that arrangement reportedly hit a snag and HTC eventually won the contract. Huawei partnered with Google for last year’s Nexus 6P (LG manufactured the Nexus 5X), and helped create a unique-looking, well-built phone with a few minor shortcomings. A follow-up device would be intriguing, but instead Google has come full-circle, enlisting the help of HTC who created the Nexus One, the very first Nexus phone. Though make no mistake: Google may be contracting out the manufacturing, but all of the branding is explicitly Google. The name of the event "Made by Google" says it all. Google is presenting the Pixel as their phone, not an Android phone with stock firmware as how the Nexus was originally presented. Google Pixel & Pixel XL Overall Google is introducing two phones: the Pixel and the Pixel XL. The former is the successor to the Nexus 5X, while the XL replaces the Nexus 6P. Compared to past generations of the Nexus lineup and even competing phones, these two phones are much closer in construction and specifications. Other than their sizes, display resolution, price, and battery capacity, both phones have the same internals and configurations, including the same cameras with the same capabilities. As a result the Pixel XL is for all practical purposes a bigger Pixel, with a battery and display to match. In terms of design and market positioning, one thing to note from the very start is that unlike the mid-range(ish) Nexus phones, the Pixel phones are meant to be flagship products. This means that Google is placing a greater focus on features and design, and that they’re also pricing the phones to match. So current Nexus users who are coming from $400 phones may be in for a bit of a shock at the $649+ Pixel. The Pixel may succeed the Nexus, but it is definitely not meant to be the Nexus. The overall design for the Pixel then is another take on the rounded glass and aluminum designs we have seen in multiple phones over the years. The back of the phone uses both materials; the top-half (including the fingerprint sensor) is glass, while the bottom half is aluminum. Matt will have more on the feel in his hands-on, but at first glance it looks like it should be similar to other phones that have used this style. Meanwhile both phones will be available in a trio of colors. Taking a minor dig at Apple, Google has named these Quite Back, Very Silver, and Really Blue, with the latter being the pre-ordained “limited edition” color. Meanwhile we’ll get to the hardware specifications in a moment, but it’s worth noting that Google is using the Pixel phones as a launch vehicle for a couple of their new technologies/initiatives. The Pixel is the first phone ready for Google’s Daydream VR platform, and pre-order customers will receive the associated Daydream View VR headset for free. The Daydream system wirelessly connects to the phone – so Google doesn’t need to worry about USB port alignments – and Google is ramping up the content side of the system with the usual mix of partnerships and leveraging YouTube’s growing capabilities. The Pixel is also being used to launch Google’s enhanced Google Assistant functionality. The successor to the Ok Google functionality in previous generation phones, Google is further expanding what their voice-activated search and action software stack can do, with a focus on making that a core part of the Pixel phone experience. This also includes opening up the system to outside developers via a new SDK that will be launching next year, so that 3rd party developers can add actions to the system.

The two cores in the performance cluster have a peak frequency of 2.15GHz, while the other two cores in the power cluster have a peak frequency of 1.6GHz. Relative to the Snapdragon 808 and 810 SoCs found on the Nexus phones, this is a shift in both frequency and architecture. As Snapdragon 821 is just a new iteration of Snapdragon 820 there won’t be any surprises here, but based on what we’ve seen in other phones that have made a similar transition to 820, we should see a good performance uplift in both CPU and GPU tasks. The Pixel phones also include 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM, twice as much as the Nexus 5X, or 33% more than the Nexus 6P. Again this is pretty standard for Snapdragon 820 devices, and should provide a kick to multitasking performance under Android. The amount of internal storage has also been significantly increased. The base models come with 32GB of NAND, while the high capacity models come with 128GB. Google has not officially disclosed which flash storage technology the Pixel is using, but it’s almost certainly UFS given the SoC and the phone’s flagship status. Like the previous generation Nexus phones, there’s no micro SD card support for the Pixel phones, so high NAND capacity is important. Coming off of the Nexus 6P little has changed – that phone was already available at 128GB – while this is a 2-4x capacity improvement over the more constrained Nexus 5X. Even then, Google is being mindful that 128GB is still a finite amount, and they will be offering unlimited photo and video storage in their cloud service for free in order to alleviate any capacity anxiety. Helping to fill that capacity will be the phones’ camera. Here Google is using a 12.3MP Sony IMX378 sensor, which can capture 1080p video at up to 120fps, or 4K video at up to 30fps. Focusing the camera is provided by the usual combination of phase detection and laser detection. Meanwhile the front camera uses a smaller Sony IMX179, an 8MP sensor with slightly smaller pixels. Somewhat surprisingly, there isn’t any OIS available on either phone. OIS is admittedly not very common on 5” and below phones, as the mechanism takes up space and Google wanted to avoid a camera hump. So the lack of OIS on even the Pixel XL may be a consequence of the shared camera model between the two phones. That said, despite the lack of OIS, one of the major marketing points for the phone is its EIS image stabilization. Here Google claims they’re sampling the gyroscope at 200Hz in order to apply what they’re promoting as some of the best image stabilization on the market. So it will be interesting to see how well that holds up in practice. EIS has made great strides over the years, but OIS sets a very high bar in the flagship market. Overall, Google spent a significant amount of time touting the image quality of the Pixel’s camera as a key product differentiator from both their earlier phones and the competition. Google’s partners used a very similar sensor on the last-generation Nexus phones, so it’ll be interesting to see just how things compare. Meanwhile on the software/implementation side, Google is also claiming that their capture time is faster than any other phone, including zero shutter lag in HDR+ mode. Meanwhile, on the display side, the Pixel and Pixel XL use 5” and 5.5” AMOLED displays respectively. The smaller phone is a 1920x1080 display, while the larger phone bumps that up to 2560x1440. We’ll have a bit more here in our hands-on look at the phone, but in the meantime Google has somewhat frustratingly opted to define the color space in terms of NTSC. So from the specifications alone it’s not clear what these phones can do beyond the usual sRGB color space, though clearly Google is looking to offer some form of wide color gamut support. That said, as Google/HTC are sourcing panels from the usual vendors, it’s unlikely there’s anything here we haven’t seen before. In terms of battery capacity, the smaller Pixel packs a 2770mAh battery – virtually identical to the Nexus 5X – while the Pixel XL bumps that up to 3450mAh, which is even more identical to the Nexus 6P. Google’s touting 26 hours of battery life for voice calls and 13 hours for internet browsing for the Pixel, and 32 hours/14 hours respectively for the Pixel XL. Both phones also implement quick charging via the USB Type-C Power Delivery standard, and Google says that the included 18W power adapter can fast charge the phone to “7 hours of use” in 15 minutes. Moving on to the modem, both Pixels are relying on the Snapdragon 821’s integrated Qualcomm X12 LTE modem, which offers up to Cat 11 performance depending on the carrier. Interestingly, in their tech specs Google notes that there will be two configurations of the phone: a North American version, and a Rest of World version. The band support for the two phones is slightly different, and this likely has something to do with Google working with Verizon as their carrier partner for the US launch. Wrapping up the specs, you’ll find the usual collection of wireless standards and interface ports. This includes 2x2 802.11ac WiFi, a USB Type-C port that supports 3.0 speeds, and a 3.5mm headset jack. Pre-orders are starting today, with units available in stores (and pre-orders presumably arriving) on October 20th. Unlike the Nexus phones, Google is going head-first into the flagship market here, so the Pixels are priced accordingly. The 32GB Pixel is $649, and the 32GB Pixel XL is $769. Bumping the capacity up to 128GB will in turn add another $100 to those prices. Source: Google Tweet PRINT THIS ARTICLE Post Your Comment Please log in or sign up to comment. POST A COMMENT 103 Comments View All Comments ddriver - Tuesday, October 04, 2016 - link Decent specs, some interesting features, many useless, overpriced. That sums it up. Reply WithoutWeakness - Tuesday, October 04, 2016 - link Really Blue. Very Silver. Much Color. Such Wow. I like the additions to Nougat but I'm really annoyed that it seems like Google is locking a few of them up to be Pixel features that require the new phone. Google Assistant integrated into the core OS à la Google Now looks to be Pixel-only from what I've read. I don't really feel compelled at all to upgrade from my Nexus 6P given the increased price and design changes (dual front facing speakers, please Google - look at that chin!). I think Google made a smart move by selling this through Verizon carrier stores as they had a hard time getting the Nexus name known to people outside the tech-savvy Android user base. Putting physical phones in stores will let people see it side-by-side with iPhones and Samsung Galaxys and it will help the brand grow. Hopefully next year we get a more inspired design - not another iPhone clone - and a few really killer features to validate the increased price point. Reply ddriver - Tuesday, October 04, 2016 - link The day I need google assistant to tell me jokes - remind me to kill myself for there is no longer any purpose in my existence. I guess simpletons will be stunned by all that cheesy hype, for me it was quite off-putting. I'd feel stupid and shallow getting a phone promoted in such a silly manner. It might be worse than apple LOL. But explains it all, seeing how they target the same price point. And sure, that's where the money is. Took them long enough... Reply Samus - Wednesday, October 05, 2016 - link Anybody who's interested in the sensor quality (or lack there of, frankly) should check out the Mi5s pic's here that showcase a variety of situations. http://www.gizbeat.com/10919/sony-imx378-is-the-ne... Basically the sensor is one of the best available (at least the best Sony has - a supplier that seems to be the flavor of the day for Android OEM's) but not THE best. I for $650-$750 I expect something better than a $30 sensor. The camera is constantly one of the most disappointing aspects of Android phones and they really need to get on it. Samsung and Apple each have over 800 engineers, programmers and testers working on their cameras so it's no surprise the experience and quality of using a camera on the Galaxy S7 and iPhones are always the industry benchmark. So long story short, why don't OEM's just pay a few bucks more and license Samsung's ISOCELL sensor? Reply tuxRoller - Saturday, October 08, 2016 - link The sensor is only one part of the equation. Optics are extremely important and I'd imagine that's where xiaomi skimped. Reply Ananke - Monday, October 10, 2016 - link Because Samsung would not sell or license the sensor to anybody, at least not at any reasonable price. It's their competitive edge, they will never give it away. Same is valid for Apple... Reply Lolimaster - Tuesday, October 04, 2016 - link Users need to stop bitting the $600+ "premium" smartphones. $400 should be their limit, nexus 6P at $400 was a high end and premium as anything else, now $250 more for another "premium device". Reply UtilityMax - Wednesday, October 05, 2016 - link Whaaa? Even 400 USD is too expensive. The 32GB Nexus 5X is now sold for under 300USD. Last week I picked up a 32GB Moto X Pure from Best Buy for just 250USD + tax. With the exception of the fingerprint scanner (which X does not even have) it matches the Nexus 6P in every other meaningful spec. Reply willis936 - Wednesday, October 05, 2016 - link If this phone had OIS and NVMe I'd happily plunk down $850 on the 128G 5" model. I bought a 6S plus when it came out because my M7's battery was EOL but iOS is just such a bad environment. The 6S hardware has spoiled me though and I don't want to go back to shaky cameras or slow storage. Reply willis936 - Wednesday, October 05, 2016 - link Also that blue is really pretty and it's always surprising how companies aren't trying to capitalize on aesthetics when they spend so much on design[1]. 1.

The unveiling of Google's in-house designed phone came as part of an expanded push into hardware by the US firm, which also revealed details of its new "home assistant", virtual reality headset and Wi-Fi router. The San Francisco event marked a shift in strategy for Google, which is leading a major push of its artificial intelligence software, Google Assistant, centred around its new smartphones and other devices. "We are building hardware with the Google Assistant at its core," said Rick Osterloh, head of a new hardware division at the California-based Internet giant. "We believe that the next big innovation is going to take place at the intersection of hardware and software, with AI at the centre." Pixel smartphone will be available with a five-inch display or a 5.5 inch display, starting at $649 for US customers, at similar prices to the latest iPhone models. Pre-orders began on Tuesday in Australia, Canada, Germany, Britain, and the United States. Google, by using its own name on handsets, is aiming for a bigger slice of a competitive smartphone market dominated by Samsung and Apple. "It's the first phone made by Google inside and out," said Sabrina Ellis of the Pixel product management team. By producing both the hardware and Android software, Google is making a more direct assault on Apple and its tightly controlled ecosystem. Along with being the first smartphone to ship with Google Assistant, it will come with unlimited storage for photos and videos and be compatible with the company's new Daydream virtual reality platform. Pixel has a "smart" camera which can select the best images from a stream, and a programme to make it easy for users to switch operating systems, a move aimed at winning over iPhone users. But Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy said it may be challenging for Google to gain significant market share. "Aside from the camera, the new Google Pixels are pretty undifferentiated compared to Samsung and iPhone 7th generation phones," Moorhead said. "They don't exactly swing anyone around the room." Google announced an exclusive deal with US telecom provider Verizon for Pixel sales and said it would also be available through carriers in other countries. Versions for sale at Google's online shop are "unlocked" to work with various carriers. As part of its expanded hardware push, Google also showed off a new Daydream View headset that compatible smartphones can be slipped into to serve as screens for virtual reality experiences. View headsets are made of soft cloth, purportedly inspired by casual clothes. Daydream View bundled with a controller device will be available in November, priced at $79. Google added to the coming hardware line-up with a modular Wi-Fi system that lets a set of inter-connected mini-modems be spread around homes to make signals strong in all spots. "Unlike a single, central router, multiple Google Wi-Fi points do a better job of delivering connectivity to all parts of the home," said Google executive Mario Queiroz. The Internet giant also introduced its Google Home virtual assistant that will be a direct challenge to popular Amazon Echo devices. Google described Home as a voice-activated cyber assistant that lets people tap into the company's online capabilities to answer questions, manage tasks, control devices in homes, stream videos and more. Google Home was priced at $129, with pre-orders starting in the United States on Tuesday. Google Home will begin shipping and be available in retail shops on November 4.   ADVERTISEMENT POST A COMMENT HOUSE RULES   1. We welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

Rick Osterloh, head of Google’s new hardware group, said that in doing so, Google can take full advantage of capabilities it’s designing with artificial intelligence and machine learning. Apple has long designed both iPhone hardware and the iOS operating-system software that runs on it. Now, Google is doing the same with the upcoming Pixel phones running Google’s Android system. The Pixel is one of several gadgets Google announced Tuesday in San Francisco. ___ NEW PHONE, NEW BRANDING, NEW MARKETING Google’s previous phones, dubbed Nexus, had limited distribution. Now, the company is casting aside the Nexus name in favour of Pixel, a brand that Osterloh said has “always represented the best of hardware and software designed by Google.” And instead of relying primarily on online orders, as was the case with Nexus, Google will offer Pixel through Verizon as well, starting Oct. 20. Advance orders began Tuesday starting at roughly $650 for the 5-inch version and $750 for the slightly larger 5.5-inch screen. Google will also make Pixel available at Best Buy and various wireless carriers outside the U.S. One of the advantages Google phones have long had is their quick access to Android updates. With other phones, individual manufacturers and carriers have to approve changes, resulting in delays . Google said Verizon will still have to approve updates for Pixel, but the process will be streamlined and done ahead of time. Google promises a spectacular camera and unlimited online storage for phones at full resolution. When storage space on the phone is low, the Pixel will free up storage and rely on the online copy. Apple takes a similar approach with its iCloud Photo Library, though free storage is limited to 5 gigabytes, or a few thousand photos. ___ IT’S IN YOUR HEAD Google’s new virtual-reality headset, Daydream View, will differ from other headsets like Samsung’s Gear VR in having a companion motion controller and compatibility with a wide range of phones, including Pixel. Daydream is also a challenge to more sophisticated, but expensive systems from Facebook’s Oculus business, HTC and Sony — as well as to Google’s own Cardboard effort. Cardboard is cheap — available for as little as $15 — but it doesn’t offer much control over VR environments beyond pushing a button on the headset as you move your head. The new wireless motion controller for Daydream can function like a fishing rod, a steering wheel or a pointer to permit more sophisticated VR experiences. Daydream View and the controller will be out in November for $79. You’ll need a new Android phone , as existing phones won’t have the right hardware. Google also plans to share design guidelines with other manufacturers to make Daydream headsets and controllers. ___ AN ECHO OF AMAZON’S ECHO Google is promoting its new Home smart speaker as a way to access Google’s knowledge — hands free. Home will be able to perform many of the same tasks as Echo, Amazon’s internet-connected speaker. Both will use voice commands to play music, field questions and control home appliances — assuming you’ve installed “smart” versions of them. If you’re feeling creepy about a speaker listening to your conversations, Google says you can turn the microphone off. Home will be available on Nov. 4 for about $130, with advance orders starting Tuesday. The cylinder-shaped Echo costs $180, though Amazon also sells a smaller version shaped like a hockey puck that sells for $50. ___ WHAT ELSE? Google’s new video-streaming device, Chromecast Ultra, will support a higher-resolution video format called 4K. Larger, more expensive streaming devices such as the $100 Amazon Fire TV already do that. Ultra will cost $69. Meanwhile, Google wants to improve Wi-Fi in the home by creating its own router. The company said people use internet differently now, with games, video chatting and more on various devices throughout the home. The new Google Wi-Fi system will cost about $130 for the main device. A three-pack for larger homes will cost about $300. ___ BEYOND GOOGLE Even as it pushes Pixel, Google isn’t abandoning the Android system that other manufacturers can use for free. That means Samsung, LG and others can keep making their own phones with Google software. In that sense, Google’s approach is more like Microsoft’s than Apple’s. Microsoft also has been making hardware through its line of Surface computers running Windows. That puts Microsoft — and now Google — in the awkward position of promoting both its own devices and those of rivals that run the company’s software. ___ BEYOND HARDWARE Google predicts that artificial intelligence will play a greater role in our lives. CEO Sundar Pichai said computing is transitioning to an AI -first world, just as it moved to a mobile-first world just a few years ago. “Our goal is to build a personal Google for each and every user,” Pichai said. “We want to build a Google for each user.” Google services along those lines include Google Assistant, software that’s designed to answer questions and retrieve information, conversation-style. Google Assistant made its debut in a chat app called Allo a few weeks ago. It will also be part of Home and the new Pixel phones. The features demonstrated Tuesday seem similar to what Amazon and Apple already offer with their virtual assistants. Google officials have repeatedly emphasized that its AI technology is in the early stages — so it remains to be seen what this new era for Google will lead to. ___ Anick Jesdanun reported from New York. shares Share: Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Share Email Advertisement Advertisement    Leave a comment Hide comments Comments are closed.
