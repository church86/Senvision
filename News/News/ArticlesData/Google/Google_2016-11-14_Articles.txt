Search Watch Live Home UK World Business Politics Technology Entertainment Strange News Weather Google plans to punish websites publishing fake news The search engine is going to restrict ads on sites which post false stories in a bid to tackle the scourge of misinformation. 08:43, UK, Tuesday 15 November 2016 Image Caption: Google plans to restrict ads to fake news websites imminently Twitter Share on Twitter Facebook Share on Facebook Google+ Share on Google+ Whats App Share on Whatsapp Mail Share by email Google has said it is working on a new policy to restrict lucrative adverts from being placed on fake news websites. Technology companies have been under increased scrutiny in the wake of the US election, amid allegations some Silicon Valley giants have failed to protect their users from inaccurate content. A Google spokeswoman said: "Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content or the primary purpose of the web property." Only on Monday, a fake story which claimed Donald Trump received 700,000 votes more than Hillary Clinton was given a prominent slot in Google rankings for the phrase "final election results". Video: Faked on Facebook: Can you tell what's true? The article was from the pro-Trump "70 News" website, and still appears high up in Google's search results even though the tech company has acknowledged the error.  Although Mr Trump won the presidency after receiving the most Electoral College votes, the Republican is actually trailing Mrs Clinton in the popular vote. Google's new policy, which could be enforced imminently, may give sites a bigger incentive to offer accurate information to readers - or face losing a hefty chunk of their revenue. Facebook is another tech company that has faced allegations of potentially swaying the election's outcome by promoting fake news stories on its social network - amid research that suggests about 60% of Americans get at least some, or all, of their news from social media. Image Caption: Mark Zuckerberg has dismissed the influence of bogus stories on Facebook On Saturday, chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said "more than 99% of what people see" on Facebook is authentic. He wrote in a post: "Identifying the 'truth' is complicated. While some hoaxes can be completely debunked, a greater amount of content, including from mainstream sources, often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted." Google said it was working on a policy change to prevent websites that misrepresent content from using its AdSense network while Facebook updated its advertising policies to state that its ban on deceptive and misleading content applies to fake news.

Earlier today those searches turned up some interesting results are Google surfaced fake election results at the top of the page, even putting those results front and center in Google Assistant. Now the company is making some changes to help prevent fake news from spreading. According to Reuters, Google is moving to restrict fake news website from using Google’s AdSense ads. It’s unclear when this new policy will take effect, or how Google plans to enforce it, but this couldn’t come at a better time. Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher’s content, or the primary purpose of the web property. How would this affect the sharing of fake news? Many websites that spread fake news content are powered by Google’s AdSense ads, relying on them to drive revenue. As posts on those websites go viral, as we’ve seen many times on Facebook especially, those sites gain money from users who visit the site. Google’s current rules for websites using AdSense block content such as violent content, pornography, or hate speech, but inaccurate news is not listed. That’s what Google aims to change. By cutting those sites off at the wallet, much of the incentive for writing fake news may be taken away, thus limiting the amount of fake news circulating on the web. Of course, enforcing all of this is going to be another story entirely. As Fil Menczer, a professor of informatics and computing at Indiana University who has studied the spread of misinformation on social media states, Google may have a tough time keeping up what qualifies as a fake news site. He said “it requires specialized knowledge and having humans (do it) doesn’t scale.” We can only hope others will follow Google’s example in stopping the spread of fake news around the web as Facebook also did tonight.

Photo: AP mail print View all comments Tweet By Nick Wingfield - - Published: 12:45 PM, November 15, 2016 Updated: 5:11 PM, November 15, 2016 WASHINGTON — During the past week, two of the world’s biggest Internet companies have faced mounting criticism over how fake news on their sites may have influenced the presidential election’s outcome. On Monday (Nov 14), those companies responded by making it clear that they would not tolerate such misinformation by taking pointed aim at fake news sites’ revenue sources. Google kicked off the action on Monday afternoon when the Silicon Valley search giant said it would ban websites that peddle fake news from using its online advertising service. Hours later, Facebook, the social network, updated the language in its ad policy, which already said it will not display ads in sites that show misleading or illegal content, to include fake news sites. “We have updated the policy to explicitly clarify that this applies to fake news,” a Facebook spokesman said in a statement. “Our team will continue to closely vet all prospective publishers and monitor existing ones to ensure compliance.” Taken together, the decisions were a clear signal that the tech behemoths could no longer ignore the growing outcry over their power in distributing information to the American electorate. Facebook has been at the epicentre of that debate, accused by some commentators of swinging some voters in favour of President-elect Donald Trump through misleading and outright wrong stories that spread quickly via the social network. One such false story claimed that Pope Francis had endorsed Mr Trump. Google did not escape the glare, with critics saying the company gave too much prominence to false news stories. On Sunday, the site Mediaite reported that the top result on a Google search for “final election vote count 2016” was a link to a story on a website called 70News that wrongly stated that Mr Trump, who won the Electoral College, was ahead of his Democratic challenger, Mrs Hillary Clinton, in the popular vote. By Monday evening, the fake story had fallen to number two in a search for those terms. Google says software algorithms that use hundreds of factors determine the ranking of news stories. “The goal of search is to provide the most relevant and useful results for our users,” Google spokeswoman Andrea Faville, said in a statement. “In this case, we clearly didn’t get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms.” Facebook’s decision to clarify its ad policy language is notable because the social network’s chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, has repeatedly fobbed off criticism that the company had an effect on how people voted. In a post on his Facebook page over the weekend, he said that 99 per cent of what people see on the site is authentic, and only a tiny amount is fake news and hoaxes. “Overall, this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other,” Mr Zuckerberg wrote. Yet within Facebook, employees and executives have been increasingly questioning their responsibilities and role in influencing the electorate, The New York Times reported over the weekend. Facebook’s ad policy update will not stem the flow of fake news stories that spread through the news feeds that people see when they visit the social network. Facebook has long spoken of how it helped influence and stoke democratic movements in places like the Middle East, and it tells its advertisers that it can help sway its users with ads. Facebook reaches 1.8 billion people around the globe, and the company is one of the largest distributors of news online. A Pew Research Centre study said that nearly half of American adults rely on Facebook as a new source. Google’s decision on Monday relates to the Google AdSense system that independent web publishers use to display advertising on their sites, generating revenue when ads are seen or clicked on. The advertisers pay Google, and Google pays a portion of those proceeds to the publishers. More than 2 million publishers use Google’s advertising network. For some time, Google has had policies in place prohibiting misleading advertisements from its system, including promotions for counterfeit goods and weight-loss scams. Google’s new policy, which it said would go into effect “imminently”, will extend its ban on misrepresentative content to the websites its advertisements run on. “Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher’s content or the primary purpose of the web property,” Ms Faville said. Ms Faville said the policy change had been in the works for a while and was not in reaction to the election. It remains to be seen how effective Google’s new policy on fake news will be in practise. The policy will rely on a combination of automated and human reviews to help determine what is fake. Although satire sites like The Onion are not the target of the policy, it is not clear whether some of them, which often run fake news stories written for humourous effect, will be inadvertently affected by Google’s change.

By Agamoni Ghosh November 15, 2016 05:38 GMT Google is working to change its policy to ban fake news websites from using its ad networkReuters Following fake news stories flooding the internet during the recent US presidential elections, Google has decided to restrict such websites from using its advertising software. The company said it was working on a fool-proof policy to prevent these websites from garnering any revenue through its network by spreading false information. AdSense, Google's advertising network, allows advertisers to place text ads on millions of websites that are part of Google's network. The company says it has always prohibited the platform from being used by sites that promote hate speech or include pornography or violent content but its policies previously did not include restrictions on sites that spread false content. Although the move aims to curb revenue these sites generate from Google's ad network, it still does not address the issue of fake news or hoaxes appearing in Google search results. Google's decision comes days after criticism poured in over Google search, Twitter and Facebook being used as promotional platforms for spreading false and malicious information which some experts believe may have swayed voters toward Republican candidate Donald Trump. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has already come out twice defending his platform in this regard and assured that alleged fake news circulated on Facebook did not influence the outcome of the election. "Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99% of what people see is authentic," he clarified in a post."Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes."

SAN FRANCISCO: Alphabet Inc's Google said on Monday it is working on a policy change to prevent websites that misrepresent content from using its AdSense advertising network, a move aimed at halting the spread of "fake news" and other types of misinformation on the internet. The shift comes as Google, Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc face a backlash over the role they played in the U.S. presidential election by allowing the spread of false and often malicious information that might have swayed voters toward Republican candidate Donald Trump. The issue has provoked a fierce debate within Facebook especially, with Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg insisting twice in recent days that the site had no role in influencing the election. Google's move does not address the issue of fake news or hoaxes appearing in Google search results. That happened in the last few days, when a search for 'final election count' for a time took users to a fake news story saying Trump won the popular vote. Votes are still being counted, with Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton showing a slight lead. Nor does it suggest that the company has moved to a mechanism for rating the accuracy of particular articles. Rather, the change is aimed at assuring that publishers on the network are legitimate and eliminating the financial incentives that appear to have driven the production of much fake news. Google's ready with its big bet in India's premium smartphone market Analysts expect Google to start with about 1 lakh devices to make a dent in India's premium smartphone segment, which is dominated by Samsung and Apple. "Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property," Google said in a statement. The company did not detail how it would implement or enforce the new policy. Macedonia news AdSense, which allows advertisers to place text ads on the millions of websites that are part of Google's network, is a major source of money for many publishers. A report in BuzzFeed News last month showed how tiny publishers in Macedonia were creating websites with fake news - much of it denigrating Clinton - which were widely shared on Facebook. That sharing in turn led people to click on links which brought them to the Macedonian websites, which could then make money on the traffic via AdSense. Facebook has been widely blamed for allowing the spread of online misinformation, most of it pro-Trump, but Zuckerberg has rejected the notion that Facebook influenced the outcome of the election or that fake news is a major problem on the service. "Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99 percent of what people see is authentic," he wrote in a blog post on Saturday. "Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes." Google has long had rules for its AdSense program, barring ads from appearing next to pornography or violent content. Work on the policy update announced on Monday began before the election, a Google spokeswoman said. The company uses a combination of humans and artificial intelligence to review sites that apply to be a part of AdSense, and sites continue to be monitored after they are accepted, a former Google employee who worked on ad systems said. Google's artificial intelligence systems learn from sites that have been removed from the program, speeding the removal of similar sites. Facebook apologizes to advertisers, here's why Facebook on Friday apologised for an error in the way it measured a key metric of video viewership that significantly amplified users' viewing times on its platform. The issue of fake news is critical for Google from a business standpoint, as many advertisers do not want their brands to be touted alongside dubious content. Google must constantly hone its systems to try to stay one step ahead of unscrupulous publishers, the former employee said. Google has not said whether it believes its search algorithms, or its separate system for ranking results in the Google News service, also need to be modified to cope with the fake news issue. Fil Menczer, a professor of informatics and computing at Indiana University who has studied the spread of misinformation on social media, said Google's move with AdSense was a positive step. "One of the incentives for a good portion of fake news is money," he said. "This could cut the income that creates the incentive to create the fake news sites." However, he cautioned that detecting fake news sites was not easy. "What if it is a site with some real information and some fake news? It requires specialized knowledge and having humans (do it) doesn't scale," he said.

Home News Companies Mobile Gadgets Opinion Cyber Security Multimedia Fin24 TechNews Google to prohibit fake news sites from using its ad software 2016-11-15 07:24 Post a comment 0 share: RELATED ARTICLES Media fights back as invasion of fake news intensifies ‘Sockpuppet’ Twitter accounts used in #HandsOffGuptas information war Did Facebook and Twitter inadvertently help Trump win? Hollywood Reporter - Google is cracking down on fake-news sites. The search giant plans to prohibit websites that publish news from using its ad software, a product called Adsense that allows publishers to place Google ads on their websites. Google's move, which will cut off a key revenue stream for these sites, comes as fake news has proliferated online, especially on Facebook, throughout the election. Google, too, has dealt with the rise of fake news. Several outlets have reported that on Sunday an inaccurate news story claiming that Donald Trump would win both the popular vote and the electoral college was the top result for some election-related searches. READ NEXT: Media fights back as invasion of fake news intensifies On Monday, Google responded swiftly. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the move, says the changes are imminent and are in line with Google's existing policies. A Google spokesperson sent the following statement to The Hollywood Reporter: "We've been working on an update to our publisher policies and will start prohibiting Google ads from being placed on misrepresentative content, just as we disallow misrepresentation in our ads policies. Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property." Facebook in particular saw the proliferation of fake news during the election, prompting some critics to question the role the social network played in helping Trump become elected. Last week, CEO Mark Zuckerberg called that notion "a pretty crazy idea." He then took to Facebook on Saturday to clarify his position, writing that "more than 99% of what people see is authentic. Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes." BuzzFeed reported on Monday that some employees at the social network would like to see Facebook clamp down on fake-news posts. Quoting unnamed sources, the online outlet reported that a group of employees have formed a renegade task force whose goal is to offer recommendations to Facebook's senior management about how to handle fake news.

By: AP | San Francisco | Updated: November 15, 2016 4:16 pm Although Google rarely removes content from its search results, the company is taking steps to punish sites that manufacture falsehoods. Google’s search engine highlighted an inaccurate story claiming that President-elect Donald Trump won the popular vote in last week’s election, the latest example of bogus information spread by the internet’s gatekeepers. The incorrect results were shown Monday in a two-day-old story posted on the pro-Trump “70 News” site. A link to the site appeared at or near the top of Google’s influential rankings of relevant news stories for searches on the final election results. Google acknowledged the problem, although as of mid-afternoon Monday, the link to “70 News” remained prominent in its results. WATCH VIDEO: US Presidential Elections: Fun Facts Although Google rarely removes content from its search results, the company is taking steps to punish sites that manufacture falsehoods. In a move disclosed Monday, Google says it will prevent its lucrative digital ads from appearing on sites that “misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information.” The action could give sites a bigger incentive to get things right or risk losing a valuable source of revenue. FAKE NEWS ON STEROIDS False information is nothing new on the internet, where debunkers have been batting down unfounded claims and urban legends for more than two decades. But the problem has gained more attention in the post-mortem of a bitterly contested presidential election in which Trump, a Republican billionaire and former reality TV star, defeated Hillary Clinton, a Democrat and former U.S. secretary of state who had been leading in the polls. Trump wound up prevailing in enough key states to win the Electoral College’s decisive vote, but is trailing Clinton in the overall popular vote with some ballots still being counted. Clinton’s lead in the popular vote has become one of the flashpoints in the protests against Trump’s election being staged in cities across the country. Google is just the latest company in the crosshairs. Fake news stories uncritically circulated during and after the election on Facebook have sparked a debate over the role of social media companies, which are key sources of news for large numbers of people. Critics suggest that these companies should be more careful to ensure they aren’t passing along misleading information. WATCH VIDEO: US Presidential Elections 2016: Here Is The Full Process SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE NEWS Google’s dominant search engine is the leading source of traffic to media sites, according to the online analytics firm Chartbeat. Meanwhile, a study by the Pew Research Center found about 60 percent of Americans get at least some of their news from social media sites such as Facebook, which now has 178 million users in the U.S. and Canada. In the election’s aftermath, Facebook has been accused of possibly swaying the election’s outcome by promoting fake news stories on its social network. Last summer, the company fired a handful of journalists who oversaw its “trending” news list and replaced them with an algorithm; fake news stories quickly began to trend. CEO Mark Zuckerberg brushed off that criticism as “crazy ” in an appearance last week. He elaborated in a Saturday post on Facebook in which he asserted that “more than 99 percent of what people see” on Facebook is authentic. Zuckerberg conceded more needs to be done to block bogus information, but said that determining what’s blatantly wrong isn’t always an easy task. “Identifying the ‘truth’ is complicated,” Zuckerberg wrote. “While some hoaxes can be completely debunked, a greater amount of content, including from mainstream sources, often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted.” The stories featured in the feeds of Facebook users are primarily selected by automated formulas known as algorithms. Google’s search results are also powered by algorithms that the company regularly revises to thwart sites that attempt to artificially boost their prominence. MORE, BETTER ALGORITHMS? Google conceded its search engine misfired with the 70 News story that falsely declared Trump the popular vote winner in both its headline and the body of the text. “In this case we clearly didn’t get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms,” the company said in a statement. Bad information in an online headline or at the top of a story can be particularly damaging. Roughly 53 percent of the people who land on a web page stay for 15 seconds or less, according to Chartbeat’s findings. Incorrect information is bound to ripple across the internet as more people rely on their phones, computers and other digital devices to read news that is picked out for them by automated programs, said media analyst Ken Doctor of Newsonomics. “What we are seeing is the failure of the algorithm,” Doctor said. “These algorithms bring a lot of things into our lives that humans cannot do. But when algorithms fail, it highlights the fact that they are not just some kind of neutral technology. They are programmed by human beings and they have all the failings of human beings.” It’s difficult to know what happened when an algorithm goes awry because Google, Facebook and other internet companies closely guard how they work, much the way Coca-Cola protects the recipe for its soda. Read: Google highlighting inaccurate story about US presidential election results But the growing power that Google and Facebook hold over the flow of information could increase the political pressure for them to be held more accountable, Doctor said. In the meantime, most people remain skeptical about what they read online. Only 4 percent of Americans have a lot of confidence in what they read on social media sites, according to Pew. Local news organizations fared better in Pew Research’s survey earlier this year, with 22 percent of Americans saying they trusted the information there.

The shift comes as Google, Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) face a backlash over the role they played in the U.S. presidential election by allowing the spread of false and often malicious information that might have swayed voters toward Republican candidate Donald Trump. The issue has provoked a fierce debate within Facebook especially, with Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg insisting twice in recent days that the site had no role in influencing the election. Google's move does not address the issue of fake news or hoaxes appearing in Google search results. That happened in the last few days, when a search for 'final election count' for a time took users to a fake news story saying Trump won the popular vote. Votes are still being counted, with Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton showing a slight lead. Nor does it suggest that the company has moved to a mechanism for rating the accuracy of particular articles. Rather, the change is aimed at assuring that publishers on the network are legitimate and eliminating the financial incentives that appear to have driven the production of much fake news. "Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property," Google said in a statement. The company did not detail how it would implement or enforce the new policy. MACEDONIA NEWS AdSense, which allows advertisers to place text ads on the millions of websites that are part of Google's network, is a major source of money for many publishers. A report in BuzzFeed News last month showed how tiny publishers in Macedonia were creating websites with fake news - much of it denigrating Clinton - which were widely shared on Facebook. That sharing in turn led people to click on links which brought them to the Macedonian websites, which could then make money on the traffic via AdSense. Facebook has been widely blamed for allowing the spread of online misinformation, most of it pro-Trump, but Zuckerberg has rejected the notion that Facebook influenced the outcome of the election or that fake news is a major problem on the service. "Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99 percent of what people see is authentic," he wrote in a blog post on Saturday. "Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes." Google has long had rules for its AdSense program, barring ads from appearing next to pornography or violent content. Work on the policy update announced on Monday began before the election, a Google spokeswoman said. The company uses a combination of humans and artificial intelligence to review sites that apply to be a part of AdSense, and sites continue to be monitored after they are accepted, a former Google employee who worked on ad systems said. Google's artificial intelligence systems learn from sites that have been removed from the program, speeding the removal of similar sites. The issue of fake news is critical for Google from a business standpoint, as many advertisers do not want their brands to be touted alongside dubious content. Google must constantly hone its systems to try to stay one step ahead of unscrupulous publishers, the former employee said. Google has not said whether it believes its search algorithms, or its separate system for ranking results in the Google News service, also need to be modified to cope with the fake news issue. Fil Menczer, a professor of informatics and computing at Indiana University who has studied the spread of misinformation on social media, said Google's move with AdSense was a positive step. "One of the incentives for a good portion of fake news is money," he said. "This could cut the income that creates the incentive to create the fake news sites." However, he cautioned that detecting fake news sites was not easy. "What if it is a site with some real information and some fake news? It requires specialized knowledge and having humans (do it) doesn't scale," he said.

I thought to myself, why not collate this data and share it?” Mainkar says. | TNN | Updated: Nov 15, 2016, 01.10 PM IST (Representative image) PANAJI: Necessity is the mother of invention and the current cash crunch faced by the common man due to the demonetization move prompted Ponjekar Prajyot Mainkar reason enough to find a solution. The result: a simple technological way out to ensure that thousands of people save time and effort while hunting for money. Mainkar setup a crowdsourced Google sheet (tinyurl.com/atmgoa) to identify ATMs in Goa that are functioning and those that are out of cash. Crowdsourcing is the practice of obtaining information or inputs on a particular project by enlisting the services of a number of people through the Internet. "Everyone is running from ATMs to banks looking for money, but the information whether the ATM is working or out of cash is not shared. I thought to myself, why not collate this data and share it?" Mainkar says. Mainkar is the founder director of Androcid Media Pvt Ltd, a startup that develops Android applications and Content Management Systems (CMS). He has served as a consultant for mobile labs startups and is a regular at the Google I/O conference. A simple Google doc page lists various ATMs around Goa and helps users decide whether it is worth the effort to travel a distance away to get funds. "I got the idea on Sunday at 1:30pm and by 2pm the site was ready. I started with Panaji, but slowly people began to add places like Mapusa, Porvorim, Ponda, Shiroda, Siolim and other locations," Mainkar says. He appears incredulous at the response he has received as the general perception is that Goans are not mobile savvy and that Internet connectivity is poor. Given the response, Mainkar is already planning several improvements in the system. "I have already had over 500 visits, with 87.9% of the users accessing the site from mobile phones of which 95% are from Android smartphones," Mainkar says. There is another reason why Mainkar is keen to ensure that the crowdsourced document gains traction. "IFFI is around the corner and Goa is expecting people from around the world. They will face a severe problem with cash and we need to cater to them," he says. Chennai and Pune have already learnt from the Ponjekar and have created similar crowd sourced sites to assist locals. "It takes a lot of time to do it alone and it cannot be done alone," Mainkar explains. He has reached out to several banks and local people to spread the message, but was surprised when banks refused to cooperate. "Currently, the Google sheet is getting updated every hour. We are looking at reducing that to less than an hour," Mainkar says. Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.

The incorrect results were shown Monday in a two-day-old story posted on the pro-Trump “70 News” site. A link to the site appeared at or near the top of Google’s influential rankings of relevant news stories for searches on the final election results. Google acknowledged the problem, although as of midafternoon Monday, the link to “70 News” remained prominent in its results. Although Google rarely removes content from its search results, the company is taking steps to punish sites that manufacture falsehoods. In a move disclosed Monday, Google says it will prevent its lucrative digital ads from appearing on sites that “misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information.” The action could give sites a bigger incentive to get things right or risk losing a valuable source of revenue. • FAKE NEWS ON STEROIDS. False information is nothing new on the internet, where debunkers have been batting down unfounded claims and urban legends for more than two decades. But the problem has gained more attention in the post-mortem of a bitterly contested presidential election in which Trump, a Republican billionaire and former reality TV star, defeated Hillary Clinton, a Democrat and former U.S. secretary of state who had been leading in the polls. Trump wound up prevailing in enough key states to win the Electoral College’s decisive vote, but is trailing Clinton in the overall popular vote with some ballots still being counted. Clinton’s lead in the popular vote has become one of the flashpoints in the protests against Trump’s election being staged in cities across the country. Google is just the latest company in the crosshairs. Fake news stories uncritically circulated during and after the election on Facebook have sparked a debate over the role of social media companies, which are key sources of news for large numbers of people. Critics suggest that these companies should be more careful to ensure they aren’t passing along misleading information. • SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE NEWS. Google’s dominant search engine is the leading source of traffic to media sites, according to the online analytics firm Chartbeat. Meanwhile, a study by the Pew Research Center found about 60 percent of Americans get at least some of their news from social media sites such as Facebook. In the election’s aftermath, Facebook has been accused of possibly swaying the election’s outcome by promoting fake news stories on its social network. Last summer, the company fired a handful of journalists who oversaw its “trending” news list and replaced them with an algorithm; fake news stories quickly began to trend. CEO Mark Zuckerberg brushed off that criticism as “crazy ” in an appearance last week. He elaborated in a Saturday post on Facebook in which he asserted that “more than 99 percent of what people see” on Facebook is authentic. Zuckerberg conceded more needs to be done to block bogus information, but said that determining what’s blatantly wrong isn’t easy. “Identifying the ‘truth’ is complicated,” Zuckerberg wrote. “While some hoaxes can be completely debunked, a greater amount of content, including from mainstream sources, often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted.” Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

Tags : iOS-iOS+ Android-Android+ Google-Google+ The topic of fake news and the websites that propagate false stories has gotten a lot of attention in the aftermath of the U.S. presidential election. Google has taken heat for having incorrect news stories pop up in its search results, while Facebook has been criticized for the amount of fake news shared on its platform throughout the campaign. Neither company is taking on fake news sites directly, but both are taking aim at disrupting the financial incentive these sites have by banning fake news websites from using the ad-selling networks from Google and Facebook. Google made the announcement first and said it would ban the sale of ads "on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher’s content, or the primary purpose," which would include fake news websites. Facebook made its announcement later and tried to make it sound as though it had this policy all along and the company was simply updating the policy "to explicitly clarify that [it] applies to fake news." The implicit aim from both companies is that by barring fake news sites from selling ads, the sites would lose financial benefits from operation. It seems to us as though Google and Facebook want to try to kill off fake news sites without taking an active hand in editorial decisions. Unfortunately, neither company has mentioned yet how they plan to identify fake news sites or enforce these policies.  source: WSJ 1 & 2 Share Tweet Share Rumor: Apple explores the production of smart glasses to wirelessly link 14 Nov Prev news Android gets an official Instagram account 14 Nov Next news Close newer posts At long last: WhatsApp's video calling feature now rolling out to all users 15 Nov Pregnant woman falls asleep on her Apple iPhone 7 and ends up with second 15 Nov Just days before unveiling, the Vivo X9 appears on Geekbench 15 Nov Android gets an official Instagram account 14 Nov Now reading: Google and Facebook ban fake news sites on their ad networks Google and Facebook ban fake news sites on their ad networks 14 Nov Rumor: Apple explores the production of smart glasses to wirelessly link 14 Nov Rejoice selfie fans, LuMee 2 is here 14 Nov You can now get the Google Pixel home button animation on the Nexus 6P 14 Nov Samsung's Black Friday 2016 deals revealed (but don't get too excited) 14 Nov Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes iPhone 7 demand has peaked, predicts yearly 14 Nov older posts Featured stories   Samsung Galaxy S8/S8 edge a.k.a.

TerryTerius (Posts: 1923; Member since: 10 Apr 2014) The difference being with a fake news site there is no expectation of "bias" and no claims of authorship. You as a reader aren't primed to reject what is being said automatically. In other words, if you present yourself as a unaffiliated party then in theory what you report would be taken more seriously. There are lots of people who believe information just because it doesn't come from the usual places. Same reason then a lot of people believe in conspiracy theories. posted on 4 hours ago 0 Reply 7.

Home News Reviews iPhone Apps Android Apps Windows Apps Top Mobiles Latest Mobiles Upcoming Mobiles PhoneRadar Explains Search PHONE FINDER COMPARE PHONES Phone News Apple explores the idea of Wearable Glass for iPhone like the Google Glass Google Glass was one of the most ambitious projects from Google back in the day. It surely did have some nifty little features that would make you go WOW on them! However, in reality, not many were interested in buying them and wearing them as a regular wearable. This started changing thereon, and the Google Glass project which was one of the most talked about device soon became dead. It is still a great concept to behold, but the not people were happy with the fact that a Glass is constantly seeing what you are doing. With that being said, it looks like Apple is going to work on something similar. We don’t have any confirmation on this. However, it does look like Apple is trying to enter the race which was once lead by Google. According to the new reports which we have here, it appears that the Cupertino Giant has purchased some of the components for testing purposes. The company has ordered small quantities of near-eye displays from one supplier. Do make a note here that, they haven’t purchased enough which indicates a mass-production yet. Hence our best guess is that they have done so for the sake of testing. Well, it is not a bad thing by any means. If the company is trying to test out something, then there is a huge potential for a possible success here, and maybe someday we will see a product from them. On the other hand, it is nothing new in the world of technology that every another day, some or the idea is explored. But that doesn’t mean that we will see a final product. In either case, don’t expect anything from the company anytime soon now. If at all the company decides to make these, we probably will not be seeing them until 2018 or even more. With that being said, let’s not speculate on this anymore since it is too early in the day to do that. If in case you remember, Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, stated that AR would take a while since there are lots of challenges on the way. However, once it happens, it will happen in a big way, and everyone will wonder how they lived without it all these years just the way you might think about smartphones now. Not the strongest of words here, but still it might give you a hint that Apple is indeed trying out their luck with the AR, etc. Who knows, maybe one day we will see a Google Glass type of product from them which will have some AR capabilities as well. Well, as mentioned earlier, it is still too early to speculate around this and hence let’s leave it here and continue speculating around something which is more likely to happen soon like the iPhone 8. We have already covered a bunch of rumors about the iPhone 8 like a bezel-less display. Stay tuned for more info on this and other news from Apple and more. Note – The featured image displayed above is of Google Glass.

Login Search Tech Stock Roundup: AAPL Upgrade, GOOGL-EU, BABA Singles Day November 14, 2016, 03:04:00 PM EDT By Sejuti Banerjea, Zacks.com Shutterstock photo The election was the biggest event last week, easily blotting out everything else, especially because of the surprise President-elect. But that didn't stop a hot Apple AAPL rumor from KGI Securities analyst Ming Chi Kuo; or Alphabet's GOOGL defense of its Android ecosystem; or the gangbuster Singles Day numbers from Alibaba BABA . So read on… Apple May Not Upgrade iPhone SE KGI Securities analyst Ming Chi Kuo is famous for breaking Apple product-related news. This time, he's saying that the company may not refresh the budget iPhone "SE" line next year. The rationale is purportedly to boost demand for the more expensive and higher-margin iPhone 7, while also pressuring SE component makers to reduce prices. This pressure may increase because Apple is now selling refurbished, certified iPhones from its online store. The iPhone SE is a very competitive and lighter phone, especially if you can make do with a smaller screen and 64GB storage, don't mind a somewhat weaker front camera and more limited water resistance, and also really want the headphone jack. The analyst feels that not refreshing the SE, weaker China demand and lower 4.7-inch volumes will impact iPhone sales next year. He forecasts an iPhone shipment volume decline to between 35 and 40 million (40.4 million units were shipped in 2Q16). He also has reservations about component price declines. Google Defends Android Google has its rival Yandex to thank for this one, as the leading Russian search engine's (until it was displaced by Google) complaint to the Competition Commission precipitated proceedings. In 2013, Google rivals Microsoft MSFT , Nokia and Oracle ORCL had gone to the EU through an umbrella organization called Fairsearch. But it was hard to pin Google guilty, leading to the case dragging on. But when in Russia, Google required phone makers to pre-install Google search (just as everywhere else) instead of Yandex, the company went to court. In this case, the EU is investigating 3 angles as Techcrunch pointed out so well- that Google is allegedly "requiring and incentivizing" smartphone and tablet manufacturers to exclusively install its own services, and in particular its search engine that it is allegedly bundling certain Google products with other apps & services whether Google is hindering the ability of smartphone and tablet makers to use and develop other OS versions of Android (aka Android forks) If found guilty, Google will have to pay up to 10% of revenue, or around $7.4 billion. The crux of Google's response of more than 100 pages is that Google's practices are with a view to prevent fragmentation of the platform without which Android would be weakened and competition would in fact be impaired. It says that the Commission's decision to omit Apple as a competitor appears arbitrary and partisan. It makes no sense because the Commission's own survey revealed that 89% of respondents consider Apple and Android as competing platforms . Besides, it allows the Commission to conveniently ignore the fact that 39 out of 39 pre-installed apps on iPhone 7 are from Apple, and 39 out of 47 pre-installed apps on the Microsoft Lumia 550 are from Microsoft. Android has allowed phone makers to bring cheaper phones to the market and has helped millions of app developers. A weak platform would be bad for everyone. In the words of Kent Walker Google's general counsel, "The response we filed today shows how the Android ecosystem carefully balances the interests of users, developers, hardware makers, and mobile network operators. Android hasn't hurt competition, it's expanded it." Alibaba Singles Day Alibaba had a record Singles Day with sales of $17.79 billion, up from the record $14.3 billion last year and short of the $20 billion analysts were projecting. But these sales are nothing to scoff at: 2015 sales in the U.S. on Thanksgiving, Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined and from all stores (both online and offline) totaled $19.4 billion. This year, Singles Day moved across the border, with the top markets for Chinese goods being Russia, Spain, Israel, Ukraine and France. Top markets selling to the Chinese were Japan, U.S., South Korea, Australia and Germany. The most popular brands were Apple, Nike, New Balance, Siemens, Philips and Adidas. Around 37% of shoppers bought from international stores with virtual reality creating new experiences like Chinese customers browsing the isles of Macy's store in New York without ever leaving their seats. But clouds are looming for Alibaba with the election of Donald Trump. The company's business hinges on China-U.S. relations, so it will be negatively hit by Trump's decision to charge a heavy tax on Chinese goods. If the Chinese government reacts with similar duty on U.S. goods, Alibaba will be affected very badly. The other concern is with respect to its accounting practices, particularly with respect to its Singles Day sales, for which the company is being investigated both in the U.S. and in China.

Adam Mosseri, VP of product management at Facebook says, "In Newsfeed we use various signals based on community feedback to determine which posts are likely to contain inaccurate information, and reduce their distribution. In Trending we look at a variety of signals to help make sure the topics being shown are reflective of real-world events, and take additional steps to prevent false or misleading content from appearing. Despite these efforts we understand there's so much more we need to do, and that is why it's important that we keep improving our ability to detect misinformation." The company earlier formed an alliance with various media houses for similar reasons although the possibility of potential business partners colluding to suppress or misinform the public for vested interests is a bit unsettling. Singapore Civil Service Chooses Facebook Workplace : Singapore's civil service is adopting the Facebook Workplace platform for its pool of 143K (and growing) public servants by March 2017. The platform is inexpensive at just a dollar per user per month for groups larger than 10K people, so it's a good deal for Facebook as well. In fact, this is the first deal of its kind for Facebook and underscores the platform's popularity in Asia. Legal/Regulatory Irish Finance Minister Will Go to Bat for Apple : The EU Competition Commission has determined that Apple owes taxes to the tune of $14.5 billion for illegally transferring profits generated in Ireland to a titular head office in a tax free zone. Irish Finance Minister Noonan says that the Commission is acting out of its jurisdiction because tax is a matter decided by individual countries and the competition angle is just a back door to meddle in the member nation's internal affairs. The tax breaks enjoyed by Apple are part of state aid that some European countries resort to with the objective of attracting investment in the region. Apple has around 6K employees in Ireland. In September, the cabinet approved Ireland's joining Apple in appealing the EU's demand, and Noonan submitted his appeal last week. LinkedIn Banned in Russia : The professional network faces a ban in Russia because of a law passed in 2014, requiring websites storing personal data of Russians to store it in servers within the country, says Russia's Roskomnadzor communications watchdog. LinkedIn reportedly has 6 million users in the country, so it could be a near-term blow. However, the problem may not be long-lived given its pending acquisition by Microsoft. Amazon Refunds for In-App Purchases : A federal judge has ruled that Amazon AMZN must take the responsibility of informing and then refunding parents, when their kids run up bills related to unauthorized in-app purchases. While judge Coughenour agreed with Amazon that the $26.5 million decided by the FTC was too high, he ruled out lump sum payments and gift cards for the amount as Amazon would collect profit on goods sold through gift cards. In similar dealings, Apple and Google coughed up around $32.5 million and $19 million, respectively. Unauthorized purchasing has been curtailed however, with the help of improved controls since then. New Technology/Products Pre-Owned iPhones Now on Sale : Last September, when Apple introduced the concept of iPhone annual upgrades and AppleCare+ for $32 a month, I had speculated that they wanted to build inventory of phones on which manufacturing cost was already recovered to target emerging markets like India. But competitors protested this in India, so Apple needed a Plan B (which may have also been in the works actually). With the anniversary up, Apple would be receiving these phones about now. So it is selling these refurbished (new battery and outer shell) phones after testing and certifying them at a 15% discount through the app store and making a huge profit. Apple is reportedly selling eight versions, all with a one-year warranty. The decision is also of great strategic importance as it could prevent users from moving away to cheaper phones from competitors. It's also a way for Apple to further expand its user base, enabling it to sell more services. The current rates are $399 for the 4GB model, which sells for $499 at full retail and $499 for the 8GB model, which sells for $599. Facebook App for Emerging Markets : Facebook is determined to eat Snapchat's lunch and the leading social network is doing about all it can to replicate Snapchat-like features such as Instagram stories, "secret" (erased after some time) conversations and more. Now it's launched Flash, a Snapchat-like platform targeted at emerging markets like Brazil, Indonesia and India where the Facebook brand name is very well recognized. This may cap Snapchat's progress in emerging markets while strengthening Facebook versus this picture-sharing networking platform. Intel's New Chip Tech : Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland has called out Intel's high-speed, in-package optical interconnect silicon photonics technology as a product with the capacity to "revolutionize the semiconductor industry". As the analyst says, it will definitely mitigate the effects of a slowing Moore's law by reducing the interconnect time between Intel's Xeon Server CPUs and Altera's FPGAs, i.e. until Intel integrates the technology into a single piece. The analyst also said that Intel has "proof of concept" chips and is looking to improve current low production yields. This could lead to a commercial product just three to five years down the line. Rolland estimates that data transfer rates may start at 50 to 100 gigabits per second with the new chips, but could increase to a half terabit or 2 terabits by early next decade, he said. Google, Apple App Store Updates : Both Google and Apple have huge app marketplaces, which might make it difficult for developers to reach buyers. The two companies are therefore always looking for ways to help developers get their apps seen. Google had many encouraging announcements such as a) allowing developers to offer limited-time discounted subscription pricing for their apps b) a promise to expand the Google Play Store to wearables, VR headsets, and Chromebook laptops for easier distribution from a single marketplace and c) a decision to employ machine-learning algorithms more heavily to provide app recommendations for Google Play users. Apple, which earlier this year promised developers a bigger revenue share and more reviews for new apps, announced that they can now create early-access promotional codes for new apps that can be offered to journalists and reviewers. These should help them generate more publicity for their new apps and in-app purchases. Some Numbers Google Home vs. Amazon Echo : IHS Markit says that Google Home will solidly beat Amazon Echo by 2020, shipping 5.4 million units that year, while Amazon will be stuck at 2.4 million units. Amazon does have a first mover advantage right now, but it will evaporate over the years as Google uses its treasure trove of data to more fruitfully apply artificial intelligence according to the research firm. Apple is also expected to join the fray with a device based on Siri. The Google device is fifty bucks cheaper at $129, but lacks Amazon's skills (app ecosystem). This should be a very short-term hurdle as Google has the wherewithal to more than catch up here.

The article falsely states that Clinton lost both the electoral college and popular votes, and its placement in search indicates how Google handles fake news.  ( David Paul Morris | Getty Images ) Advertisement Shortly after the rise of accusations targeted at Facebook for helping, by some measure, influence the outcome of the 2016 Presidential Election due to its lackluster efforts in eliminating fake news on people's newsfeeds, another company has been found to have also mishandled fake news. This time, it's Google. Several websites have reported seeing a fake news article featured as one of Google's top stories upon entering relevant search terms such as "Presidential election results" or something similar along the lines. Dan Abrams of Mediaite first spotted the incident. Google normally tallies up relevant news stories that correspond to the search terms users enter. In this case, an article from a blog called "70 News" was placed at the top or grouped within legitimate stories. The article in the aforementioned blog declares President-elect Donald Trump as having successfully won both the electoral college and the popular votes. For the record, Democratic Presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, despite losing the electoral college votes, won the popular vote, with unaccounted mail-in and absentee ballots slated to further balloon her tally in a couple of weeks' time. The trail of evidence that lead to the article's assumption begins with a USA Supreme article having denoted that Clinton might win votes tallied but won't win votes cast because of "ignored Republican absentee ballots." A Twitter user named Michael used the USA Supreme article to inaccurately report the number of popular votes. The author of 70 News then used Michael's numbers to create the article that's now showing up atop Google's search results. The Rising Problem Of Fake News Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg has rebuked a growing belief that the careless proliferation of fake news on the site helped propel Trump to win the presidency, with the foremost issue trailing toward the abysmal practices of Facebook in keeping its site disinfected from fake news, or similar inaccurate reports that often inhibit an agenda with questionable and even conceptually violent intents, such as, but not limited to, spurring hate crimes. Now that there's a new President-elect, a surfeit of analyses is littering the web, either knee-jerk or rational appropriation pieces on why the elections turned out the way it did. All the polls previously heralded Clinton as the surefire winner by a staggering percentage that eclipsed Trump's chances of victory. As publications spurn or scrutinize the turnout, pressure has been put on social media sites with flawed algorithms causing the lack of a proper weeding-out of fabricated and false coverage. Google Bans Fake News Sites Google is planning to elbow fake news sites away from its advertisement software, the company told the Wall Street Journal on Monday. Google banning these sites from taking advantage of its ad-selling software is an indication that it's addressing the recent criticism received by social media sites on its mishandling of inaccurate information. Google has promised to gate-keep ads from appearing on websites that distribute fake news. "The goal of Search is to provide the most relevant and useful results for our users," a spokesperson from Google told The Verge, stating that it's currently fine-tuning its algorithm.

Alphabet, Google's parent company has announced plans to prohibit fake news sites from using the company's ad-selling software, AdSense, which is how many of those sites make revenue. According to the Wall Street Journal, Google is updating its policies to prohibit its ads from being displayed "on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose," as well as those that distribute fake news. While preventing those sites from using AdSense will not necessarily curb the sharing of misinformation, the move will hurt those site's ability to make money, possibly forcing them to close. The spread of fake news has become a huge post-election topic, with Facebook, in particular, coming under fire for spreading fake information during the months leading up to the presidential election. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has previously said that the idea the fake news influenced the election is "crazy." However, BuzzFeed reports that a group of Facebook employees have reportedly created a secret internal task force to investigate and perhaps offer a solution to the issue.

Investor demand for Prosper's loans had evaporated and losses were mounting.  But that sacrificial gesture wasn't enough. Vermut resigned as CEO last week, the company said Monday, and will be replaced by CFO David Kimball.  The news is yet another sign that online lending companies remain in turbulent waters following the scandal that engulfed market leader Lending Club in May.  AOC prosper Seize the day!

The battle cry seems to have resonated, as Bloomberg reports that news organizations are seeing a marked increase in contributions and subscriptions.  At the New York Times, reports Bloomberg, "subscriptions have risen at four times their normal rate since election day." More, traffic has been ballooning. The Wall Street Journal, too, has been seeing an influx in subscriptions. Meanwhile, the nonprofit ProPublica was flooded with donations Monday.  Since winning the election last week, Donald Trump has continued his attacks on the media, in particular the Times, which he criticized on Twitter.  Will the spiked interest in well-reported news continue or will the fad inevitably die down as people return to their Facebook-oriented lives? As a journalist, I certainly hope it continues, but who knows!

The developer of the software, Shanghai Adups Technology, says the program runs on more than 700 million devices, from phones, cars, and other hardware. As of now the most affected are international consumers and owners of disposable and prepaid phones, but one Miami-based phone manufacturer, BLU Products, says at least 120,000 of its phones contained the bug, which it has fixed via software update. Adups apparently designed the backdoor to help an undisclosed Chinese phone manufacturer monitor user behavior, but the program ended up on American phones anyway. The Times points out that Adups lists two China-based largest phone makers, ZTE and Huawei, as distribution partners–both of which have been trying to make inroads in the U.S., and would likely see those efforts scrutinized if either is linked to the backdoor revelation. JJM 11.15.16 | 10:35 am Average monthly earnings for gig economy workers are in decline  Sharing economy platforms like TaskRabbit and Uber are struggling to retain their workers—and now, we have a better idea as to why. Average monthly earnings for labor platform contractors have fallen 6% since June 2014, according to a new analysis by the JPMorgan Chase Institute.  The declining wages are due in part to increased competition, which has led to lower prices. (No wonder over half of Uber drivers quit within a year.) However, the change in wages differs dramatically from city to city. In Atlanta, for example, average monthly earnings dropped 10% between June 2016 and June 2015, landing at $647. But in Los Angeles, over the same period, earnings rose 14% to $960.  [Photo: Flickr user Renate Dodell] AOC airbnb 11.15.16 | 10:09 am Verizon continues IoT investment spree, buying LQD WiFi  IoT has become a major priority for Verizon, which sees potential for growth in layering services for connected devices over its network infrastructure.

The "gender" field in the app will now include non-binary gender identification terms, as well as a write-in option; users can also opt to keep their gender private.  • Both Google and Facebook have taken steps to combat fake news following the election, by barring fake news sites from using AdSense and The Facebook Audience Network, their respective advertising businesses.  • Apple is reportedly looking into creating digital glasses with augmented reality tech, according to Bloomberg.  PM 11.15.16 | 7:54 am Google, Facebook, and others ask Trump to support encryption and immigration reform The Internet Association, which has more than 40 members including Google, Twitter, Facebook, and Amazon, has penned a letter urging President-elect Trump to implement stronger reforms on government surveillance programs, support net neutrality, and "expand and improve the green card program" for immigrants, reports the Verge. Trump was particularly harsh on tech companies on the campaign trail, notably calling out Apple for not helping the government unlock iPhones in specific law enforcement cases. The letter ends stating, "The internet industry looks forward to engaging in an open and productive dialogue" with the president-elect. That's a more congenial tone than what most of the tech leaders had for Trump before the election, when 100 of them signed a letter saying a Trump presidency would be a "disaster for innovation."

The animal parts are being sold in private Facebook groups that require approval from a group admin before a member can join. In all, $53.1-million worth of ivory and other animal parts have been sold in the last 18 months.  MG Facebook 11.15.16 | 1:30 am WhatsApp adds a feature: video calling Facebook owns two messaging services. One, Facebook Messenger, does a ton of stuff. The other, WhatsApp, is famous for sticking to the basics—which, rather than hurting it, has helped it rack up more than a billion active users. But now WhatsApp is adding something: the ability to make video calls. The feature is especially logical given that the app is widely used by folks to stay in touch with distant friends and family in other countries. (The app introduced voice calls last year.) Video calling is rolling out "in the coming weeks" and will be available in WhatsApp's versions for iOS, Android, and Windows.   HM Whatsapp 11.14.16 | 11:27 pm Following Google, Facebook also moves to ban fake news sites from using its ad network In the face of widespread criticism that the proliferation of fake news posts on Facebook played a role in misleading voters and impacting the presidential election, on Monday evening the company banned fake news from using its ad network. The Facebook Audience Network is used by third-party sites and apps to display ads to users, with Facebook getting a portion of the ad revenue. With today's move, Facebook is adding such fake news sites to its blacklist of misleading and illegal sites that aren't allowed to use the ad network. The step follows Google, which earlier today banned fake news sites from using its AdSense ad-selling software. "Our team will continue to closely vet all prospective publishers and monitor existing ones to ensure compliance," a company spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal.  MB Facebook Advertise Privacy Policy Terms About Us Fast Company & Inc © Mansueto Ventures, LLC
Back To Top[*] Google moves to restrict ads on fake news sites Nov. 15, 2016 - 01:45PM JST Alphabet Inc’s Google said on Monday it is working on a policy change to prevent websites that misrepresent content from using its AdSense advertising network, a move aimed at halting the spread of “fake news” and other types of misinformation on the internet. The shift comes as Google, Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc face a backlash over the role they played in the U.S. presidential election by allowing the spread of false and often malicious information that might have swayed voters toward Republican candidate Donald Trump. The issue has provoked a fierce debate within Facebook especially, with Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg insisting twice in recent days that the site had no role in influencing the election. Google’s move does not address the issue of fake news or hoaxes appearing in Google search results. That happened in the last few days, when a search for ‘final election count’ for a time took users to a fake news story saying Trump won the popular vote. Votes are still being counted, with Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton showing a slight lead. Nor does it suggest that the company has moved to a mechanism for rating the accuracy of particular articles. Rather, the change is aimed at assuring that publishers on the network are legitimate and eliminating the financial incentives that appear to have driven the production of much fake news. “Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher’s content, or the primary purpose of the web property,” Google said in a statement. The company did not detail how it would implement or enforce the new policy. AdSense, which allows advertisers to place text ads on the millions of websites that are part of Google’s network, is a major source of money for many publishers. A report in BuzzFeed News last month showed how tiny publishers in Macedonia were creating websites with fake news - much of it denigrating Clinton - which were widely shared on Facebook. That sharing in turn led people to click on links which brought them to the Macedonian websites, which could then make money on the traffic via AdSense. Facebook has been widely blamed for allowing the spread of online misinformation, most of it pro-Trump, but Zuckerberg has rejected the notion that Facebook influenced the outcome of the election or that fake news is a major problem on the service. “Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99 percent of what people see is authentic,” he wrote in a blog post on Saturday. “Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes.” Google has long had rules for its AdSense program, barring ads from appearing next to pornography or violent content. Work on the policy update announced on Monday began before the election, a Google spokeswoman said. The company uses a combination of humans and artificial intelligence to review sites that apply to be a part of AdSense, and sites continue to be monitored after they are accepted, a former Google employee who worked on ad systems said. Google’s artificial intelligence systems learn from sites that have been removed from the program, speeding the removal of similar sites. The issue of fake news is critical for Google from a business standpoint, as many advertisers do not want their brands to be touted alongside dubious content. Google must constantly hone its systems to try to stay one step ahead of unscrupulous publishers, the former employee said. Google has not said whether it believes its search algorithms, or its separate system for ranking results in the Google News service, also need to be modified to cope with the fake news issue. Fil Menczer, a professor of informatics and computing at Indiana University who has studied the spread of misinformation on social media, said Google’s move with AdSense was a positive step. “One of the incentives for a good portion of fake news is money,” he said. “This could cut the income that creates the incentive to create the fake news sites.” However, he cautioned that detecting fake news sites was not easy. “What if it is a site with some real information and some fake news? It requires specialized knowledge and having humans (do it) doesn’t scale,” he said.  Back To Top[*] Switch to full browser version © 2016 GPlusMedia

Snowden says tech companies should protect privacy no matter who is president Posted Nov 10, 2016 by Devin Coldewey, Contributor 0 SHARES Next Story Slice makes it easy for you to order from your favorite pizzeria Advertisement Edward Snowden gave an extended interview today touching on numerous topics, from the Trump Presidency to his own future. Overall his message was clear: it’s not about thwarting one leader or even one government, but using technology that guarantees rights across borders and administrations. In other words: don’t hate, innovate. One of the early questions in the interview, which lasted a bit under an hour and was sponsored by Startpage.com, was posed by Phil Zimmerman, creator of the PGP encryption protocol. Trump, he said, would be inheriting a powerful surveillance infrastructure — something that worries many. “We should be cautious about putting too much faith or fear in elected officials,” Snowden said. “We’re never farther than an election away from a change in leader, from a change in policy, a change in the way the powers we have constructed into a system are used. So what we need to think about now is not how do we defend against a president Donald Trump, but how do we protect the rights of everyone, everywhere, without regard to jurisdictions, without regard to borders?” “Ultimately,” he said, “if we want to see a change, we must force it through ourselves.” Of course, until we do, there are good and bad ways of going about the business of communicating online. Snowden suggested that we need to look for companies “that see you as their primary customer.” In other words, not Facebook or Google. “Everything you type into that Google prompt is being saved forever,” he pointed out (to the evident glee of his interviewer, who represents a Google alternative). Whereas in the case of encrypted messaging app Signal, which fought and triumphed over a government gag order to reveal orders to turn over information on a user. Because Signal is end-to-end encrypted, all it could turn over — even had it wanted to give more — was a phone number (which the government already had), an account creation date, and a last login time. “The best way to defend against it,” Snowden said, in reference to the surveillance apparatus, “is to make sure you do not collect information, as a business, that you do not need.” Latest Crunch Report Snapchat Starts Selling Spectacles | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes His voice joins a chorus of others calling for companies to rein in data collection ahead of Trump’s inauguration, after which many expect an expansion of powers in law enforcement and surveillance. Snowden had very little practical advice other than using encryption and two-factor authentication. He did endorse Signal more than once, however, as he has done before. As for himself, he downplayed the idea that Trump and Putin would change the existing stalemate regarding his asylum. “I don’t worry about it,” Snowden said. “It would be crazy to dismiss the idea of this guy who presents himself as a big deal-maker, trying to make a deal. But the President of Russia has said on camera that the people of Russia consider me a human rights defender, and regardless of the position that we have on Russian politics — which obviously have a lot of problems — they said that Russia is not a country that extradites human rights defenders.” He also discussed where work needs to be done in the future.

Encrypted comms company Silent Circle closes $50M Series C “Encryption protects what you said on a phone call as it crosses the internet, it protects what was written in a text message, it protects your picture so no one can see it,” he said. “But it does not disguise the fact that you sent a photograph or made a phone call. These things on their own can be very dangerous. Metadata of your activities can often be collected even without the involvement of a court. This means you can create perfect records of private lives without ever reading what was actually said.” His suggestion: “We have to find a way to protect not only the content of communication, but to disguise the fact that the communication ever happened at all. The fact that this phone called this phone should be invisible to the vast majority.” Tor is a start, he said, but crude, like the first wheel. The very nature of how information is broadcast over radio frequency may need to be questioned, he mused.

Waxing philosophical, he continued, saying that privacy has little value for the majority, the people in positions of power who don’t need to watch what they say. “Minorities, vulnerable populations, people who don’t fit in — if you disagree with the majority opinion, you are the ones privacy is for. If you argue that if you have nothing to hide you have nothing to fear, that’s no different than saying you don’t care about free speech because you have nothing to say. It’s an antisocial argument.” To protect this right, Snowden returned to the concept of privacy being enforced not through legislation, but technology. “When the law fails, when we find out that the law is not enough, that the law is only the smallest guarantee of our rights, support technology, corporations, groups, and individuals who are trying to enforce your rights directly,” he said, “through science, through math, through technology, to ensure that any government anywhere must respect your rights — because no amount of violence, no amount of military force will ever solve a math problem.” Although Snowden largely avoided addressing the risks of a Trump Presidency during his talk, the mask did crack slightly as he led up to an inspiring finish to one of the later questions. “”Despite the challenges we have in the United States, despite the changes in government, despite some of the very concerning statements made by our new President-elect, this is a nation that will strive to get better,” he said. “This is a dark moment in our nation’s history – but it is not the end of history. and if we work together, we can build something better.” Featured Image: Bryce Durbin 0 SHARES Featured Stories Microsoft teams up with Elon Musk’s OpenAI project 3 hours ago | Frederic Lardinois Google and Facebook ban fake news sites from their advertising networks 5 hours ago | Romain Dillet WhatsApp launches video calling for everyone 11 hours ago | Josh Constine, Sarah Perez Valuation metrics show weakening for the fourth straight quarter 17 hours ago | Connie Loizos Latest From TechCrunch Nike’s self-lacing shoes are coming soon, priced at $720 16 minutes ago | Brian Heater The cameras are coming 17 minutes ago | John Mannes Ava, the fertility wearable, raises $9.7M to help families conceive 22 minutes ago | Sam O'Keefe Apple’s big App Store purge is now underway 38 minutes ago | Sarah Perez Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe Advertisement Comment moderation powered by Up Next Slice makes it easy for you to order from your favorite pizzeria Posted Nov 10, 2016 CrunchBoard Job Listings Infrastructure Engineer Tango at The Sourcery (Mountain View, CA, United States) Senior Software Engineer @ Pared at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) Software Engineer @ Pared at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) Technical Content Writer @ Pantheon at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) Staff Software Engineer @ Lending Home at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) More from CrunchBoard Advertisement TechCrunch News Video Events Crunchbase TechCrunch Store About Staff Contact Us Advertise With Us Send Us A Tip International China Europe Japan Follow TechCrunch Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Youtube Pinterest Tumblr Instagram StumbleUpon Feed TechCrunch Apps iOS Android Windows 8 Subscribe to The Daily Crunch Latest headlines delivered to you daily Subscribe to <span class="no-mobile">Subscribe to </span>The Daily Crunch Enter Email Address Subscribe © 2013-2016 AOL Inc.

SAN FRANCISCO: Alphabet Inc's Google said on Monday it is working on a policy change to prevent websites that misrepresent content from using its AdSense advertising network, a move aimed at halting the spread of "fake news" and other types of misinformation on the internet. The shift comes as Google, Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc face a backlash over the role they played in the US presidential election by allowing the spread of false and often malicious information that might have swayed voters toward Republican candidate Donald Trump. The issue has provoked a fierce debate within Facebook especially, with Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg insisting twice in recent days that the site had no role in influencing the election. Google's move does not address the issue of fake news or hoaxes appearing in Google search results. That happened in the last few days, when a search for 'final election count' for a time took users to a fake news story saying Trump won the popular vote. Votes are still being counted, with Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton showing a slight lead. Nor does it suggest that the company has moved to a mechanism for rating the accuracy of particular articles. Rather, the change is aimed at assuring that publishers on the network are legitimate and eliminating the financial incentives that appear to have driven the production of much fake news. "Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property," Google said in a statement. The company did not detail how it would implement or enforce the new policy. Macedonia news AdSense, which allows advertisers to place text ads on the millions of websites that are part of Google's network, is a major source of money for many publishers. A report in BuzzFeed News last month showed how tiny publishers in Macedonia were creating websites with fake news - much of it denigrating Clinton - which were widely shared on Facebook. That sharing in turn led people to click on links which brought them to the Macedonian websites, which could then make money on the traffic via AdSense. Facebook has been widely blamed for allowing the spread of online misinformation, most of it pro-Trump, but Zuckerberg has rejected the notion that Facebook influenced the outcome of the election or that fake news is a major problem on the service. "Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99 per cent of what people see is authentic," he wrote in a blog post on Saturday. "Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes." Google has long had rules for its AdSense program, barring ads from appearing next to pornography or violent content. Work on the policy update announced on Monday began before the election, a Google spokeswoman said. The company uses a combination of humans and artificial intelligence to review sites that apply to be a part of AdSense, and sites continue to be monitored after they are accepted, a former Google employee who worked on ad systems said. Google's artificial intelligence systems learn from sites that have been removed from the program, speeding the removal of similar sites. The issue of fake news is critical for Google from a business standpoint, as many advertisers do not want their brands to be touted alongside dubious content. Google must constantly hone its systems to try to stay one step ahead of unscrupulous publishers, the former employee said. Google has not said whether it believes its search algorithms, or its separate system for ranking results in the Google News service, also need to be modified to cope with the fake news issue. Fil Menczer, a professor of informatics and computing at Indiana University who has studied the spread of misinformation on social media, said Google's move with AdSense was a positive step. "One of the incentives for a good portion of fake news is money," he said. "This could cut the income that creates the incentive to create the fake news sites." However, he cautioned that detecting fake news sites was not easy. "What if it is a site with some real information and some fake news? It requires specialized knowledge and having humans (do it) doesn't scale," he said. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

According to The Wall Street Journal, Google is working on a policy update that will prohibit fake news websites from using its ad-selling software. The move would ultimately make it more challenging for those fake news sites to earn revenue. Reuters reports: The policy change is imminent, Google spokeswoman Andrea Faville told Reuters. "Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property," she said in a statement. The policy change comes amid an intensifying debate over how much responsibility technology companies bear for monitoring the accuracy of content as more and more people access news through sites such as Facebook rather than traditional media companies. Facebook, in particular, has been criticized over the spread of inaccurate articles promoting U.S. president-elect Donald Trump on the site. Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has denied that the site influenced the outcome of the election. Google's AdSense advertising network is a key financial driver for many publishers. The company places various restrictions on where its ads may be placed, including bans on pornographic and violent content. Work on the policy update began before the election, Faville said. ads facebook google ← Related Links → Apple Considering Expansion Into Wearable Glasses, Says Report Facebook's Fight Against Fake News Was Undercut by Fear of Conservative Backlash Chemical Traces On Your Phone Reveal Your Lifestyle, Scientists Say Google To Prohibit Fake News Websites From Using Its Ad-Selling Software More | Reply Login Google To Prohibit Fake News Websites From Using Its Ad-Selling Software Post Load All Comments  Full  Abbreviated  Hidden /Sea Score: 5 4 3 2 1 0 -1 More | Reply Login   Nickname: Password: Public Terminal Forgot your password?

Eyes on Sarkozy as fresh claims of Gaddafi funding arises ProjekMMO: Penyanyi Siti Sarah nafi pitam dirasuk jin Ikatan calls for ban on Bersih 5, Red Shirts to prevent bloodshed Advertisement More stories                Tools Increase Text Decrease Text Reset Text Print Article A report in BuzzFeed News last month showed how tiny publishers in Macedonia were creating websites with fake news — much of it denigrating Clinton — which were widely shared on Facebook. — Reuters picSAN FRANCISCO, Nov 15 — Alphabet Inc’s Google said yesterday it is working on a policy change to prevent websites that misrepresent content from using its AdSense advertising network, a move aimed at halting the spread of “fake news” and other types of misinformation on the internet. The shift comes as Google, Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc face a backlash over the role they played in the US presidential election by allowing the spread of false and often malicious information that might have swayed voters toward Republican candidate Donald Trump. The issue has provoked a fierce debate within Facebook especially, with Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg insisting twice in recent days that the site had no role in influencing the election. Google’s move does not address the issue of fake news or hoaxes appearing in Google search results. That happened in the last few days, when a search for ‘final election count’ for a time took users to a fake news story saying Trump won the popular vote. Votes are still being counted, with Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton showing a slight lead. Nor does it suggest that the company has moved to a mechanism for rating the accuracy of particular articles. Rather, the change is aimed at assuring that publishers on the network are legitimate and eliminating the financial incentives that appear to have driven the production of much fake news. “Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher’s content, or the primary purpose of the web property,” Google said in a statement. The company did not detail how it would implement or enforce the new policy. Macedonia news AdSense, which allows advertisers to place text ads on the millions of websites that are part of Google’s network, is a major source of money for many publishers. A report in BuzzFeed News last month showed how tiny publishers in Macedonia were creating websites with fake news — much of it denigrating Clinton — which were widely shared on Facebook. That sharing in turn led people to click on links which brought them to the Macedonian websites, which could then make money on the traffic via AdSense. Facebook has been widely blamed for allowing the spread of online misinformation, most of it pro-Trump, but Zuckerberg has rejected the notion that Facebook influenced the outcome of the election or that fake news is a major problem on the service. “Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99 per cent of what people see is authentic,” he wrote in a blog post on Saturday. “Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes.” Google has long had rules for its AdSense program, barring ads from appearing next to pornography or violent content. Work on the policy update announced on Monday began before the election, a Google spokeswoman said. The company uses a combination of humans and artificial intelligence to review sites that apply to be a part of AdSense, and sites continue to be monitored after they are accepted, a former Google employee who worked on ad systems said. Google’s artificial intelligence systems learn from sites that have been removed from the program, speeding the removal of similar sites. The issue of fake news is critical for Google from a business standpoint, as many advertisers do not want their brands to be touted alongside dubious content. Google must constantly hone its systems to try to stay one step ahead of unscrupulous publishers, the former employee said. Google has not said whether it believes its search algorithms, or its separate system for ranking results in the Google News service, also need to be modified to cope with the fake news issue. Fil Menczer, a professor of informatics and computing at Indiana University who has studied the spread of misinformation on social media, said Google’s move with AdSense was a positive step. “One of the incentives for a good portion of fake news is money,” he said. “This could cut the income that creates the incentive to create the fake news sites.” However, he cautioned that detecting fake news sites was not easy. “What if it is a site with some real information and some fake news? It requires specialised knowledge and having humans (do it) doesn’t scale,” he said. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Sony’s PS3 celebrates 10-year anniversary Tinder launches transgender-inclusive update, allowing users to select personalised gender identity (VIDEO) Internet Association seeks peace with wish list for Trump WhatsApp joins rivals from Snapchat to WeChat in video calls Is the world ready for Apple glasses?

The LG V20 will be available in US carrier stores at the end of this week and it will appeal to many Android fans. Android 7.0 Nougat released: What to expect on the Nexus 6P Android's latest software is available starting today, if you own a compatible Nexus device. The LG V20 will be the first non-Nexus to launch with Nougat while many other devices will get it over the next few months. Read More The LG V20 is one of the few flagship devices with a removable battery and microSD expansion card slot. Thankfully, it does not have the failed modular design of the LG G5. It's a worthy successor to the LG V10 and may appeal to the road warrior. The LG V20 is the first non-Pixel Android smartphone to launch with Android 7.0 Nougat so you won't have to wait ages to be updated to the latest version of the operating system. Specifications LG sent along the T-Mobile LG V20 for me to evaluate so I could use it daily with my own personal SIM card, which is the best way to truly test out a mobile phone. Processor: 2.15 GHz Snapdragon 820 Display: 5.7 inch Quad HD IPS at 2560 x 1440 pixels resolution, 513 ppi. Secondary display: 160 x 1040 pixels, 3.1 inches Operating system: Android 7.0 Nougat RAM: 4GB Storage: 64GB internal storage and microSD card slot Cameras: Dual rear cameras; 16 megapixel 75-degree f/1.8 and 8 megapixel 135 degrees f/2.4. Front-facing 120-degree 5 megapixel f/1.9 with toggle for 83 degrees. Audio: Loud, bottom-facing mono speaker with 3.5mm headset jack Extras: IR port for remote control, FM radio Battery: 3,200 mAh removable battery with Quick Charge 3.0 technology Dimensions: 159.7 x 78.1 x 7.6 mm and 174 grams Last year, it was rare to find water resistance and millions of us were able to survive without it for years. However, after I killed the pre-production model while it was in my pocket during a walk in light rain, I am hesitant to buy a phone without some form of water resistance or nano coating. Hardware The LG V20 is a big phone, 1.5 mm taller and 0.2 mm wider than the Apple iPhone 7 Plus. It is 14 grams lighter so if you are OK carrying the iPhone 7 Plus, or 6s Plus for that matter, then you will likely be just fine with the LG V20 too. Top ZDNET Reviews Dell Latitude 11 5000 7.9 Apple iPhone 7 Plus 9.3 Amazon Echo 9.0 Google Pixel XL Phone 8.0 Like the iPhone 7 Plus, the LG V20 is a glass and metal beast. With a removable metal back, you might think it feels cheap and that the fit and finish would suffer. That is not the case here as LG has done a great job with a solid back release button, positioned as if it was a camera capture button, and a metal back that extends up the sides and nearly the entire back of the phone. The metal is thin and light, but when it is locked into place on the back of the LG V20 it feels great. Seams are tight, the glass/metal/plastic meetups on the corners of the sides look good, and overall the LG V20 is a smart looking device. It will definitely look good in the office and conference room. In addition to good looks, the LG V20 is built with AL6013 aluminum and silicone polycarbonate to withstand the MIL-STD 810G transit drop test. We saw this integrated durability with the LG V10 so it's great to know your phone could survive an accidental drop. The LG V10 had sturdy stainless steel rails and a rugged rubberized back. The LG V20 uses thin aluminum material and it doesn't feel as substantial as the V10. The front Gorilla Glass 4 extends all the way to each side and just a few mm from the top and bottom. There is a plastic and glass bottom bezel with LG stamped into the glass portion. It's a smaller chin than the Google Pixel and Moto Z with the plastic and glass offering a nice place to rest your thumb. Above the main display you will find the secondary display with the front facing camera to the left and headset speaker above. Volume buttons are found on the upper left with the back cover release button towards the lower right. The speaker, a mic opening, 3.5mm headset jack, and USB Type-C port are all positioned on the bottom. Another mic is placed on the top, along with a very small opening for the IR port. There is a definite camera hump on the back, centered above the rear fingerprint scanner. I'm personally not a fan of rear fingerprint scanners as it requires that I pick up the device to unlock it while it rests on my desk. The camera protrusion contains the dual LED flash, two rear cameras, and the laser sensor. Just looking at the back tells you that the LG V20 is a media capture focused device. LG V20 review: in pictures SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 13 NEXT PREV One rear camera has a 135-degree lens with a single button toggle in the camera software. You can capture more content in your photos through the front 120-degree lens too. Again, there is a toggle for the front facing camera to have a standard image or wide-angle image from the front. T-Mobile continues to improve and expand its LTE network and one unique feature of the LG V20 is support for T-Mobile's new LTE AWS-3 spectrum. This support should give users more capacity for data, depending on whether or not the area you are in supports AWS-3. It's nice to buy a phone with support for the latest and greatest network technology, especially when it also launches with the newest version of the Android operating system. The LG V20 is a media creation machine with three excellent cameras and three mics. The V20 captures audio using 24-bit/48 kHz Linear Pulse Code Modulation (LPCM), the same format used in professional video equipment. A quad-DAC (digital to audio converter) from ESS Technologies is included in the LG V20. T-Mobile and Sprint include the B&O Play H3 headphones so you can enjoy a fantastic audio experience with your favorite music. Android Authority has a very detailed article that explains all you ever wanted to know about this technology. The bottom line is that high resolution audio files should be more enjoyable, but even with my standard quality audio files I am enjoying the music experience on the LG V20. Software Typically when you purchase a new Samsung, LG, or HTC device you are buying one with the previous version of the Android OS. Thankfully, LG worked with Google to launch the LG V20 with Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box. Google will keep some Nougat features exclusive to the Pixel line, but it's still good to know that you are purchasing a phone with the latest version of Android. The LG V20 I am using has the 1 September 2016 Android security update too. As the mobile space continues to evolve, most manufacturers have learned to reduce the influence of their custom UI. Samsung TouchWiz is unrecognizable from the past heavy-handed cartoon animations, however LG still has a UI that is a bit too strong in my opinion. You can customize the heck out of the device though and you can always install a third party launcher if that works better for you. I installed the Google Now launcher as I prefer to swipe over for the Google Now screen and am satisfied with the LG V20 running in this manner. LG calls its latest UI LG UX 5.0+. By default, there is no app drawer present, but a simple toggle enables the more traditional app drawer for those who prefer this interface. LG UX 5.0+ includes Knock Code, 2nd screen notifications and controls, advanced audio recording modes, themes, LG Health improvements, multi-window support, and more. These type of manufacturer customizations may slow things down a bit, but so far I haven't seen lag on the LG V20. LG attempts to implement a comfort screen feature, but it is only enabled manually. iOS and some other Android devices let you setup a time when the display switches to a mode to help with late night or early morning usage and I would like to see LG implement this functionality too. Pricing and competition The T-Mobile LG V20 will be available this week for $769.99, which is actually about $100 less than competing flagship devices. In addition, when you purchase this phone from T-Mobile you receive a free pair of B&O Play H3 earphones, a $149.99 value. LG phones have always launched a bit less than other flagships and the LG V20 is no different. A comparable 128GB Apple iPhone 7 Plus is priced at $849. The 128GB Google Pixel XL is $869. The 6-month old Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, with 64GB internal and microSD card, is priced at $789.99. LG V20 first impressions: in pictures SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 12 NEXT PREV The price of the LG V20 looks to be all over the place with AT&T charging $829.99, Verizon $672, and Sprint $792. Sprint also includes a free pair of Bang & Olufson H3 earphones. Daily usage experiences and conclusion LG doesn't get much respect in the mobile space, but then again it launched the LG G5 with no useful modular accessories so hasn't necessarily convinced people it deserves their business. The LG V20 was announced in early September and may have won some new customers if it could have been available a few weeks ago when the Galaxy Note 7 went down in flames. That said, the LG V20 will be launching this week and it is a fantastic option for Android smartphone fans. As I stated in my first impressions, the more I use the LG V20 the more I like it. Now that I have it loaded up with all of my favorite apps and have been using it as my daily driver it is definitely a device to consider. If you create content, both in images or audio, then I don't think you will find a device better than the LG 20. Audio quality is outstanding and the ability to control and edit the audio right on the phone is amazing. It's truly a portable media creation machine. Call quality is outstanding on the T-Mobile network with VoLTE and video calling support. The inclusion of AWS-3 is important for the enterprise customer looking for a phone that is able to work with future network expansion. Some folks won't buy a phone without a removable battery and with this feature, you will be able to use the LG V20 for years. When the battery degrades over time, simple replace it and get back in action again. It would be great to at least see some nano coating in the device, but without that if you intend to use the LG V20 outside in the elements you should look for a water resistant case.

The Wall Street Journal reports that fake news has been added to the list of content that disqualifies a website from tapping into the Facebook Audience Network, which allows sites and mobile apps to post display advertisements to visitors, with Facebook sharing some of the generated ad revenue. “While implied, we have updated the policy to explicitly clarify that this applies to fake news,” a Facebook spokesperson told the Journal, adding that fake news would now come under the umbrella category of misleading, illegal and deceptive sites, which already cannot use the ad network. The change in policy closely follows a similar move by Google, also announced Monday, which would see websites publishing fake news barred from its advertising network. Read More: Facebook Changes Rules Around Controversial Race-Based Ads A Google spokesperson said in a statement that “pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher’s content, or the primary purpose of the web property” will join the list of websites banned from using Google AdSense, reported Reuters. The report noted that AdSense already restricts ad placement on sites containing pornographic or violent content. The role of tech giants like Google and Facebook in the spread of untruths and hoaxes online is in the spotlight. While Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg doesn’t think that the spread of untruths on his network affected the outcome, and doesn’t want Facebook to be the “arbiters of truth,” others have pointed out the platform’s sheer, unprecedented influence as a media entity. There are no indications that Facebook’s latest move would affect the types of content allowed on its own platform’s News Feed. Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

The shift comes as Google, Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc face a backlash over the role they played in the U.S. presidential election by allowing the spread of false and often malicious information that might have swayed voters toward Republican candidate Donald Trump. The issue has provoked a fierce debate within Facebook especially, with Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg insisting twice in recent days that the site had no role in influencing the election. Google’s move does not address the issue of fake news or hoaxes appearing in Google search results. That happened in the last few days, when a search for ‘final election count’ for a time took users to a fake news story saying Trump won the popular vote. Votes are still being counted, with Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton showing a slight lead. Nor does it suggest that the company has moved to a mechanism for rating the accuracy of particular articles. Rather, the change is aimed at assuring that publishers on the network are legitimate and eliminating the financial incentives that appear to have driven the production of much fake news. “Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher’s content, or the primary purpose of the web property,” Google said in a statement. The company did not detail how it would implement or enforce the new policy. AdSense, which allows advertisers to place text ads on the millions of websites that are part of Google’s network, is a major source of money for many publishers. A report in BuzzFeed News last month showed how tiny publishers in Macedonia were creating websites with fake news – much of it denigrating Clinton – which were widely shared on Facebook. That sharing in turn led people to click on links which brought them to the Macedonian websites, which could then make money on the traffic via AdSense. Facebook has been widely blamed for allowing the spread of online misinformation, most of it pro-Trump, but Zuckerberg has rejected the notion that Facebook influenced the outcome of the election or that fake news is a major problem on the service. “Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99 percent of what people see is authentic,” he wrote in a blog post on Saturday. “Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes.” Google has long had rules for its AdSense program, barring ads from appearing next to pornography or violent content. Work on the policy update announced on Monday began before the election, a Google spokeswoman said. The company uses a combination of humans and artificial intelligence to review sites that apply to be a part of AdSense, and sites continue to be monitored after they are accepted, a former Google employee who worked on ad systems said. Google’s artificial intelligence systems learn from sites that have been removed from the program, speeding the removal of similar sites. The issue of fake news is critical for Google from a business standpoint, as many advertisers do not want their brands to be touted alongside dubious content. Google must constantly hone its systems to try to stay one step ahead of unscrupulous publishers, the former employee said. Google has not said whether it believes its search algorithms, or its separate system for ranking results in the Google News service, also need to be modified to cope with the fake news issue. Fil Menczer, a professor of informatics and computing at Indiana University who has studied the spread of misinformation on social media, said Google’s move with AdSense was a positive step. “One of the incentives for a good portion of fake news is money,” he said. “This could cut the income that creates the incentive to create the fake news sites.” However, he cautioned that detecting fake news sites was not easy. “What if it is a site with some real information and some fake news? It requires specialized knowledge and having humans (do it) doesn’t scale,” he said.

CST November 14, 2016 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST SAN FRANCISCO — Facebook isn't the only source of fake news on the Web. Alphabet's Google was dragged into the muck Monday, when its search engine prominently displayed an obscure right-wing blog, 70news.wordpress.com, that falsely claimed President-elect Donald Trump won the popular vote in last week's election.  (Hillary Clinton leads Trump by nearly 700,000 votes, but Trump won in the Electoral College.) "The goal of Search is to provide the most relevant and useful results for our users. In this case we clearly didn’t get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms," Google spokeswoman Maggie Shiels said in a email statement. The results popped up under a Google search banner called  "In the News" when a user searched for "who won the popular vote." As of Monday evening, the blog's post was still there, though it followed stories that referenced the erroneous results. In the News is different from Google News (news.google.com.) The dust-up, on the heels of criticism that Facebook was a breeding ground for misinformation during the run-up to the presidential election, is more fodder for a national debate on the responsibility of social media and other types of technology that broadly disseminate information to billions of people worldwide. Most news carried on Google's search engine comes from established media sources such as the New York Times and CNN, according to data analysis from journalists at the University of Maryland. The erroneous blog post is sure to give technology another black eye in what has been mounting criticism about its propensity to amplify misleading information across broad digital platforms. Facebook has been assailed for prominently featuring fake news on its site, prompting CEO Mark Zuckerberg to deny it unwittingly helped Trump become president-elect. He said 99% of news on the social network is "authentic," and has vowed to weed out fake news. A group of Facebook employees have formed an unofficial task force to refute Zuckerberg's claim that the company bears no responsibility for the spread of fake news, according to a BuzzFeed News report. Facebook was not immediately available for comment.

New Report Claims Cupertino Giant Working On Smart Glasses With AR By Corazon Victorino On 11/14/16 AT 10:33 PM Close Over the weekend, a limited number of Snapchat’s Spectacles sunglasses went on sale. The high-tech glasses that work with both Android and iOS devices records 10-second video clips that can be uploaded into Snapchat story. Since the $130 device is making waves and getting attention from the techie community, could Apple be also planning to release its own version of the Spectacles? On Monday, unnamed sources told Bloomberg that Apple is planning to expand into digital glasses for its next endeavor in the wearable market. The Cupertino giant’s glasses project is said to be in the exploration phase for now, but the company could already have the fixed goal of producing glasses that would show images and other real-time data in the wearer’s field of vision. The glasses are also expected to connect wirelessly to Apple’s iPhones and work using augmented reality.  Given that the product is not going to focus on recording short video clips, the device couldn’t technically be considered as Apple’s direct competitor to Snapchat’s Spectacles. Instead, this could be Apple’s attempt at capturing the market that showed interest in Google’s dormant Google Glass wearables. Should this project progress, the tech community could expect Apple’s digital glasses to arrive possibly in 2018.  Related Stories Snapchat Spectacles Release Date: Buy Them From Snapbot Mobile Vending Machines Facebook Flash Unveiled For Developing Countries: Report New Snapchat Update For iOS Adds Support For Spectacle Glasses But When Will They Release? Per the leaksters who shared the information about Apple’s next wearable, a clear sign that Apple is serious about the project is how CEO Tim Cook has been acquiring projects and teams of developers to beef up the company’s AR technologies. Also, Cook, himself, has been quite vocal about his interest in AR, as per AppleInsider.  The Google Glass was introduced as an advanced head-mounted display that utilized augmented reality to display weather information directly in the user’s field of vision. It also allowed users to make calls and take photos. Unfortunately, privacy concerns caused a huge blow to the project, such that it was eventually stopped in January 2015. However, on the project’s official website, it is stated there that the journey of Google Glass has not ended yet. Google also stated that consumers will see the future versions of the smart glasses when they are ready.  Since the Google Glass is not an active product for the time being, this could be the perfect timing for Apple to introduce its own smart glasses, which are now believed to be part of the augmented reality projects of the tech giant. Another project that is making headlines recently pertains to the rumored full VR headset that the company could be launching in the near future.

Kantipur The Kathmandu Post saptahik Nepal Nari Radio Kantipur Kantipur TV 0Shares Share on facebookShare on twitter Entertainment Mi Mix: A vision into the future of smartphones Mi Max is not a perfect phone, but does bring a lot of innovation that could drive smartphone design in the days to come - Prajesh SJB Rana The Mi Mix’s true allure lies in the display of the phone. The device features a 6.4 inch IPS LCD display at a resolution on 1080 x 2040 pixels in a form-factor as big as the iPhone 7 Plus which features a smaller 5.5-inch display Nov 15, 2016- In 2016, we’ve seen a lot of innovative products that have pushed the boundaries of the tech industry. We’ve seen VR technology turn into a reality and we’ve even seen high-quality camera drones that have made aerial shots commonplace in low-budget music videos and films. We’ve also seen Microsoft’s innovative Surface Pro that redesigns how professional content creators work with a computer. While, unfortunately, Google modular phone design concept, Project Ara, was cancelled earlier this year; we got to see their Pixel line of phones which hints at a truly Google phone. Apple, however, disappointed most of their customer base with mediocre improvements to the iPhone line and the MacBook line. In the growing area of consumer technology, Apple seems to be slowly losing their innovative edge. Apple played it safe with both the iPhone 7 and 2016 MacBook Pro releases and while Apple had hinted at a bezel-less iPhone 8, where the company’s true innovation would start. Unfortunately, however, for the Cupertino company, their hopes of awing their consumer-base with a truly innovative device has been cut-short by the Chinese company Xiaomi. The recently released Xiaomi Mi Mix is a technological marvel to behold because of the device’s bezel-less edge-to-edge display. But no matter how innovative Xiaomi’s bezel-less device is, they weren’t the first company to dabble in a phone with a bezel-less display. The first phone to feature a bezel-less display would be the Sharp Aquos Crystal, a phone Sharp released in 2014. While the Aquos Crystal did feature a beautiful bezel-less screen that awed consumers, the phone suffered because of sub-par hardware and a notoriously thick chin at the bottom that worked against the overall aesthetic of the device. The phone also had horrible call-quality issues because of the technology used by Sharp. Sharp used a technology called Direct Wave Condenser, which vibrated the whole screen to produce sound waves that entered the user’s ear. This, which looked great in theory, did not work well in practical use since a lot of the Aquos Crystal users complained of horrible call-quality. The second version of the Aquos Crystal, released in 2015, suffered from similar issues which hindered the overall adoption-rate of the phone. As a result, the Sharp Aquos Crystal phones did not do well commercially and seemed more like a concept phone rather than a phone ready for consumer use. While the Mi Mix is also a concept phone at this point, the true innovation of the Chinese company comes forward in the different ways that Xiaomi has managed to overcome all of Sharp’s initial shortcomings. The Mi Mix has exceptional hardware since it comes equipped with top-of-the line Snapdragon 821 SOC, four or six GB of RAM depending on the model. The device is also equipped with a massive 4400 mAh battery that ensures exceptional battery life. The phone performs exceptionally well on benchmark tests where the Mi Mix beat both the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and Google Pixel. While the Mi Mix performs better than the Sharp Aquos Crystal phones, the phone also implements better technology to ensure better call-quality. While Sharp’s Direct Wave Condenser failed in delivering good call-quality, Xiaomi’s Peizoelectric Ceramic Actuator works exceptionally well. While the technology works by converting electric energy to mechanical energy, slightly similar to the technology used by Sharp, call-quality on the Mi Mix feels natural and easy on the ears. While these specifications and technology might be impressive, the Mi Mix’s true allure lies in the display of the phone. The device features a 6.4 inch IPS LCD display at a resolution on 1080 x 2040 pixels in a form-factor as big as the iPhone 7 Plus which features a smaller 5.5-inch display. The device is a tad bit on the heavier side, weighing at 209g, and is even a bit thicker at 7.9 mm. While I could argue that for such a premium device, Xiaomi should have opted for a QHD display, the display on the Mi Mix actually performs really well. The screen itself is sharp, the colours vibrant and the great brightness at 783 Lux. Watching videos or playing games on the bezel-less 6.4-inch screen is a pleasure. When taking a photo, the way the screen blends in with the real-world is astonishing. But as much as I’ve been advocating the device’s bezel-less screen, it’s not completely bezel-less since there is a visible bezel next to the display but this is so minimal that it can easily be ignored. But taking into account how well the screen looks and performs, the Mi Mix’s screen can be touted as a natural evolution to the Sharp Aquos Crystal displays. But, to utilise a bezel-less display, a lot of compromises have to be made. Since the top chin of any phone contains essential parts such as light-sensors, proximity-sensors and the front-facing camera, having a bezel-less display without the top chin would expose the company to some extremely specific problems. Sharp handled these issues by moving all of the top-chin components to the bottom-chin which is the reason why the Sharp phones featured such a large chin, but the Mi Mix’s bottom chin is thin too. For Xiaomi to reduce the size of the bottom chin, they had to get rid of some essential features like the earpiece and the proximity sensor. Instead of the proximity sensor, the Mi Mix comes with an ultrasound technology that determines proximity with the use of algorithms and software. Without these two components to hog space on the chin of the phone, Xiaomi has managed to considerably reduce the size of the bottom chin; but the smaller front-facing camera and the ambient light sensors have been moved to the bottom. The front-facing selfie camera suffers because of this. Every time you’re taking a selfie, the camera is bound to be obstructed by your finger. Palm rejection technology also needs to be on point on a bezel-less display because while grabbing the phone, your palms are bound to rest on the screen. The Mi Mix is also made out of ceramic which adds to the premium look and feel of the phone. The device is also the first phone to use Zirconia ceramic and the glass feel of the ceramic body makes touch input of both the body and the screen feel seamless. But the main concern here would be durability. By the looks of it, the Mi Mix is not very durable. Accounting how the screen does not have a bezel to protect the screen during an accidental fall or even how ceramic, even though it’s a durable material, is weak on the corners which would be fatal should the phone fall on one of its corners. But the phone looks good enough to turn heads when you use it in front of other people. The Mi Mix also comes in an 18k model, which features the eight GB RAM module that comes equipped with real 18 karat gold rings around the fingerprint reader and the rear camera modules. The use of ceramic also makes the phone slippery and more prone to drops but thankfully, Xiaomi includes a decent leather case for the phone in the box. The Mi Mix is currently marketed as a concept product which is why it has been produced in limited qualities and is available only in China. But even though Xiaomi has labelled the Mi Mix as a concept, it does bring new technology to the field of smartphones. While earlier Xiaomi had been criticised as blatantly copying Apple’s design aesthetics, the Mi Mix is a phone concept that looks original and innovative. There are a lot of flaws on the Mi Mix phones, like how poorly the camera performs on the device or even how the design aesthetics leaves the phone more vulnerable to accidental drops. The Mi Max is not a perfect phone as of right now, but does bring a lot of innovation that could drive smartphone design in the days to come, especially since smartphone designs have been stagnating for a long time. The Mi Mix brings a lot to the table and compromises very little, an effort for which Xiaomi should be lauded. All in all, Xiaomi has managed to create a truly beautiful phone and even though the Mi Mix is not being mass marketed, it is one of the most innovative products to come out this year.

Lighthouse is a Chrome extension that they built to help you optimize your Progressive Web App. There's a new Security tab in Chrome Dev Tools. Polymer is sugaring on top of Web Components that makes the web platform more capable. Browsers have implemented Web Components, minus the HTML imports part. Polymer App Toolbox makes it easy and fast to prototype a Progressive Web App, and to transition from prototype to real app. beta.webcomponents.org AMP: Accelerated Mobile Pages 700,000 domains are using AMP. developers.google.com/web/ browser-issue-tracker-search.appspot.com: Search for bugs across the major browsers. Progressive Web App Roadshow: developers.google.com/web/events/ He mentioned Web Assembly, WebGL, WebVR, AR (augmented reality) etc. Imagine you walk up to a device. It uses web Bluetooth to share a URL. The URL takes you to a website that allows you to control the device. The website uses web Bluetooth to control the device. Intermission bigwebquiz.com There are a lot of subtle anti-Trump references from the various speakers. Building Progressive Web Apps @thaotran A 1MB download can cost up to 5% of the monthly salary for some people. She talks to lots of companies about being early adopters of web technologies. Flipkart built a Progressive Web App that was really successful. They saw as much traffic on mobile web as on their mobile app on the biggest shopping day of the year in India. Smashing Magazine: A Beginner's Guide to Progressive Web Apps What is a Progressive Web App: it's about radically improving the web user experience. It should be your main web site. developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/checklist has a baseline and an exemplary checklist. She mentioned the Lighthouse Chrome extension. Alibaba conversion rate improvement: +14% iOS +30% Android housing.com was paying $3.75 to acquire new Android users. However, it only cost them $0.07 to acquire new mobile web users. lyft is no longer app only. They built a web app, and they got 5X more traffic than they expected. Android app: 17MB iOS: 75MB PWA: < 1MB makemytrip.com found that for first visit bookings, PWA users book 3X more than often than app users. IBM acquired The Weather Company (The Weather Channel). Things they're talking about: Progressive Web Apps Accelerated Mobile Pages Push Notifications Seamless Sign-In One Tap Checkout Sign-in on the Web 54% of users will abandon rather than register. There's an autocomplete attribute that you can use on your login forms. 92% of users will leave a site instead of resetting login info. g.co/2CookieHandoff: 2 cookie handoff using Service Workers There's a Credential Management API. It's a standards-based browser API. It's in Chrome. Automatically sign in the user on the homepage. AliExpress: 11% increase in conversion 85% drop in sign-in failures 60% decrease in time spent signing in It can work with federated accounts such as logging in with Google or Facebook. Google Smart Lock: the browser remembers your credentials. Then, on another device, it'll automatically sign you in. Nice demo. Google Smart Lock even works with federated accounts. It also works even if you've signed in in multiple ways. Really impressive. g.co/CredentialManagementAPI Faster Web Payments @zachk PaymentRequest. Let the browser help you with checkout. Mobile has 66% fewer conversions than on desktop. Chrome started with autofill. Set autocomplete types on the checkout forms. But, today, he's talking about PaymentRequest. It's a new payments API for the web. It's *not* a new payment method or a processor/gateway. It's a standards-based API baked into the browser. polykart-credential-payment.appspot.com The API is based on native UI. Really seamless. No keyboard usage needed (except typing in the CVC). For now, Chrome supports credit cards and Android Pay. It's really about helping the user avoid filling in a bunch of form fields. The browser can help a lot. Kill the cart: give the user an option to "Buy Now". Think of this as a progressive enhancement. PaymentRequest works best for new users and guest checkout flows. Coming soon: support for third-party payment apps. Integration guide: goo.gl/eLefwM I think this is only mobile for now. Debugging the Web @paul_irish The call stack now looks better, even when you shrink the window. Chrome supports ES6 pretty well. Even in the console, ES6 is supported pretty well. Even async/await. You can now enter multiple lines in console.log without hitting shift return. It indents as you go. It does brace matching. He pointed out that Safari had this first. Tab completion works in the console quite nicely. It even works for arrays once you hit '['. The tab completion works with substring completion instead of just prefixes--just type any part of the word. There's a snippets tab in the sources tab where you can have snippets of code that might be useful. These are persistent. Inline breakpoints: You can place a breakpoint, and then it allows you to drag the breakpoint within the line. Note to self: never use the unauthenticated GitHub API during a demo--you might get rate limited. At the very least, have some static data to use as a backup. The workspaces feature is improved: In Sources: Network: Drag an OS X folder onto the left pane. Without configuration, you should be able to edit your code in Chrome. It works even if you're using transpilation with sourcemaps. There's a new shadow editor. As of today, in the Canary, there's a checkbox with CSS coverage. You hit record, and then start using the site. It'll mark the CSS styles that were never used. He's using iTerm2. node --inspect app.js It gives you a URL. That's the old way. However, in Sources, there's a Node thing under Threads. Then, in Console, there's a context. You can use a single instance of Dev Tools to debug both the frontend and the backend. Application tab >> Manifest: Tells you about the state of your Service Workers. There's also Application >> Clear storage. Application: Service Workers >> Update on reload. Lets you reload the service worker every time. There's also "Bypass for network". That's useful to skip the service worker. He plugged the Lighthouse extension again. It's useful to turn a web app into a Progressive Web App. It also helps audit for best practices. Captures performance metrics too. It's just a Node module. A lot of tools are already building on top of it. You can even set it up for use in CI. Chrome Dev Tools >> Settings >> More tools >> Audits 2.0 is powered by Lighthouse. They wrote caltrainschedule.io. @ChromeDevTools. He's using Visual Studio Code a bit. Polymer, Web Components, & You @TaylorTheSavage "We are at war with phones." #UseThePlatform Polymer is the Chrome team's set of libraries for web developers to take advantage of the web platform. Web components is an umbrella term for a bunch of low-level features. Web components v1 is something today. All major browsers are onboard with everything--except HTML Import, that's still on hold. Cross-browser web components are here. Polymer is a light weight layer on top of Web Components. It's evolved with Web Components. Polymer 1.0 is production-ready. That was released last year. Comcast, USA Today, ING, Coca Cola, EA, etc. use Polymer. It's used by Chrome, Play Music, YouTube Gaming, YouTube (their next version of mobile and desktop app). There's a Polymer App Toolbox that they released a while ago to show how to build full apps: App Components Polymer CLI PRPL Pattern: Use HTTP/2, and push as little as possible. shop.polymer-project.org 75% of mobile connections in sub-Saharan Africa are 2G. It's forecasted to be 45% in 2020. She showed off Jumia Travel. It uses very little data, yet still provides a nice UI. They're working on Polymer 2.0. They just released the preview editing. They're focused on: Web Component v1 support. Better interoperability with other JavaScript libraries. It's truly web native, and looks just like a normal web component. Minimal breaking. There's an interoperability layer. You can incrementally upgrade. Polymer is only 12kb. Mobile web development is hard, expensive, inefficient, slow, and confusing. There are about 500+ apps using Polymer. There's an event system. Use properties, not methods. Use dialog.open = true instead of dialog.open(). Properties go down. Events go up. "Fear driven development." Be afraid of your users. Be afraid of breaking changes. tattoo = Test All The Things Over & Over = it's their repo for testing Web Components. Be afraid of perf regressions. polydev is a tool that you can use to see how expensive the various elements are. polyperf lets you compare the performance between changes. demo-snippets shows you an element and how to use it. It's dynamic, so that you can edit the code. webcomponents.org has re-usable elements. Progressive Performance @slightlylate Great talk! He showed this comic: xkcd.com/1367 "So it takes a lot for me to get to this point. But seriously folks, time to throw out your frameworks and see how fast browsers can be." He mentioned extensibleweb/manifesto. RAIL: Respond: 100ms Animate: 8ms Idle work: 50ms chunks Load: 1000ms to interactive 53% of users bounce from sites that take longer than 3 seconds to load. The average mobile site takes 19 seconds to load. "Your Laptop Is A Filthy Liar": Simulating real devices using Chrome is just not the real thing. Use Chrome inspect in order to use USB to debug real devices. It's really, really hard to hit RAIL on mobile, even with a reasonable phone like a Nexus 5X. "The Truth Is In The Trace". Use Dev Tools attached to real devices. He tests with cheap, slow phones. He doesn't think that emulation cuts the mustard. If you're using a $700 iPhone and assuming the other users are like that, you're wrong. World-wide phones are getting slower as more poor people buy cheap phones. Desktop is 25X faster than a desktop. He added an ice pack to the bottom of a phone in order to keep it cool, and his benchmark ran 15% faster ;) Desktops are faster because they can dissipate more heat. He recommended the paper, "Dark Silicon and the End of Multicore Scaling". We can't use all the silicon in our phones because of the heat dissipation constraints. And the battery has only 10 watt hours. We can't dissipate enough power, and we can't carry enough power. A cell phone battery can't keep a 60W light bulb lit for more than a few minutes. big.LITTLE refers to the technique of having a mix of: Infrequently used "big" (high power) cores Agressively used "little" (lower power) cores You get what you pay for when it comes to mobile devices. "Touch boost": when you touch the screen, it turns on the more powerful CPUs. "Benchmarketing" is a thing. A MacBook Pro has the maximum amount of power stored in a battery that you can bring onto a plane. Nexus 5X has 2 fast cores and 4 slow ones. Flash read performance: MBP: ~2GB/s N5X: ~400MB/s Mobile phones use fewer flash chips which means less parallelism which means slower. Think of mobile phones as having spinning disks from 2008. "High Performance Browser Networking" is a really good book. He highly recommends it. "Mobile networks hate you." "Adaptive Congestion Control for Unpredictable Cellular Networks". What's really killing you is the variance / volatility. LTE speed is actually getting slower. Different markets are wildly different. "A 4G user isn't a 4G user most of the time." -llya Grigorik It's really hard to get anything on the screen in 3 seconds because it takes so long to even spin up the radio. The tools and the methods that we've brought over from the desktop just aren't working. Using the platform well is the only way to go. Today's frameworks are signs of ignorance or privilege or both. It's broken by default. Server-side rendering = isomorphic rendering = universal rendering The Pixel phone is pretty good. Most phones aren't. Scrolling != interaction. We want progressive interactivity. Only load the code that you need right now. shop.polymer-project.org Using HTML imports with tiny scripts means you don't have big bundles that make the thread choke. Service workers lets you return something quickly from cache. The top-level SW shouldn't depend on the network. Don't use a SW that hits the network first. github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse "Mobile Hates You; Fight Back!" Test on real hardware. Use a Moto G4. Use Chrome Inspect on Dev Tools. That'll show you what it's like in the median real world. Use WebPageTest since it lets you use real mobile phones. PRPL is important (but I don't know what it's about yet). The challenge is larger than you think it is. Real Talk About HTTPS @estark37 Over 50% of pages are loaded over HTTPS. www.google.com/transparencyreport/https/metrics For desktop platforms, 75% of time is spent on HTTPS. It's probably on top sites. For some reason, it's somewhere around 33% for Android. They don't know why, but they have a theory that it's because they're those users aren't using sites like Gmail and Facebook like they would be on desktop because they instead use apps for those. Hence, any web usage is most likely for longer tail sites. They're restricting powerful features if you're not using HTTPS. Geolocation is one example. Mozilla is only going to support HTTPS for all new features. istlsfastyet.com: From llya Grigorik. HTTP/2 is only available if you're also using HTTPS. HTTP/2's performance advantages can more than offset the cost of TLS. They have a goal of HTTPS everywhere. At this point, we can't yet use an insecure icon everytime there's a site that uses HTTP. It would just desensitize people to the risk. Let's Encrypt: Free, easy certificates. It's a certificate authority. Chrome made a large donation to Let's Encrypt. It's usage is growing exponentially. All Google sourced ads are already served over HTTPS. developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/encrypt-in-transit/enable-https Moving to HTTPS can be done with no impact on search rankings. There's a Security tab in Chrome Dev Tools. It can help. They want to start easing users into thinking that HTTP is bad. Chrome will start saying "(i) Not secure" in the URL bar for pages that have passwords or credit card inputs on them. Building a Service Worker They built a service worker in real time. He used async and await. I think he said it's only in Canary, though :-/ The service worker will look to see if it itself has been updated. He's using VS Code. A Service Worker can be spun down even if the tab is still open. Wow, they keep making the Service Worker more and more complex. It seems like a giant house of cards. There's an offline checkbox in Chrome Dev Tools in the Application tab, and there's also one at the top of Dev Tools. They're not in sync. He's clear that his example is not production code. Cache invalidation is hard. That was some pretty impressive real-time coding. Planning for Performance @samccone "Mobile web" is no longer a subset of the web. It is simply the web. It's more than just responsive CSS. Mobile has been bigger than desktop since 2014. The average mobile web user is not on a $600+ phone. They're more likely to use the free phone you get when you sign up for a plan. The average Android phone has 1G or less of RAM. The average load time for mobile sites is 19 seconds. HTTP2 + link rel="preload" <link href="bower_components/polymer/polymer.html" rel="preload">
 He used this trick to move from 5 seconds to 3 seconds from first byte to first useful paint. H2 Server Push: Push assets from the server to the client before the client even requests them. It's not cache aware. It lacks resource prioritization. But, H2 Push + Service Workers = awesomeness He went from 5 seconds to 1.7 seconds. Preload is good for moving the start download time of an asset closer to the initial request. H2 Push is good for cutting out a full RTT if you have SW support. Older phones are slow when parsing a ton of JavaScript. Event relatively recent phones suffer because of how much JavaScript there is to parse. There is no simple way to see the parse cost of JavaScript. There's some cool new thing in Chrome Canary: V8 internal metrics in timeline Webpack Bundle Analyzer is very helpful to figure out what's in your bundle. Fetch but don't parse: <script src="..." type="inert">
 
 Put it in the page, but don't eval it until you strip the comments out: 
 <script id="inert">
    /* (...) */
</script>
 
 He talked about Webpack require.ensure and the aggressive splitting plugin. Test on real devices on mobile networks. Optimize network utilization: sw, preload, and push for fast first loads. Parsing JavaScript has a cost: ship the smallest amount of JS possible. Predictability for the Web This was a product manager-like talk about making Chrome and the web in general more predictable. The browser companies are working together more and more. He talked about resolving bugs in Blink, the engine behind Chrome. 2/3rds of the top 1% of bugs have been fixed. Using chrome://flags, you can turn on "Experimental Web Platform Features". They fix regressions very quickly. They do want to occasionally deprecate things. Chrome shipped something to improve power substantially by not doing as many request animation frames for iframes not showing. Filing or starring a bug is the quickest way to get your issue resolved. developers.google.com/web/feedback They built a Browser Bug Searcher to search for bugs across browsers. They're trying to treat the web as a single platform. Panel A lot of Google apps aren't Progressive Web Apps. One of the most difficult things to debug in web apps is memory leaks. HTML imports will probably not survive the way they are, but eventually, there will be something better. A few people complained about Chrome Web Apps being deprecated.

The social network has updated its advertising policies to spell out that its ban on deceptive and misleading content now also applies to fake news. The shift in policy comes as Google, Facebook and Twitter all faced a backlash over the role they played in the U.S. presidential election.  Facebook has announced a crackdown on the spread of 'fake news' sits by trying to limit the amount phony sites can make in advertising. The sites were accused of spreading false and often malicious information that might have swayed voters towards Republican candidate Donald Trump. And the debate became so fierce, that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg was forced to insist twice in recent days that his social network had no role in influencing the election. But announcing new measures today, a statement on Facebook said: 'We do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news', adding that it will continue to vet publishers to ensure compliance.

Share this article Share However, Facebook's steps are limited to its ad policies, and do not target fake news sites shared by users on their news feeds. Meanwhile, search engine Google has also said it is working on a policy change to prevent websites that misrepresent content from using its AdSense advertising network. Google's move similarly does not address the issue of fake news or hoaxes appearing in Google search results. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, pictured,  was forced to insist twice in recent days that his social network had no role in influencing the election Nor does Google suggest that the company has moved to a mechanism for rating the accuracy of particular articles. Rather, the change is aimed at assuring that publishers on the network are legitimate and eliminating financial incentives that appear to have driven the production of much fake news. The company said in a statement: 'Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property.' The company did not detail how it would implement or enforce the new policy. AdSense, which allows advertisers to place text ads on the millions of websites that are part of Google's network, is a major source of money for many publishers. A report in BuzzFeed News last month showed how tiny publishers in Macedonia were creating websites with fake news - much of it denigrating Clinton - which were widely shared on Facebook. That sharing in turn led people to click on links which brought them to the Macedonian websites, which could then make money on the traffic via Google's AdSense. Facebook has been widely blamed for allowing the spread of online misinformation, most of it pro-Trump, but Zuckerberg has rejected the notion that Facebook influenced the outcome of the election or that fake news is a major problem on the service.  Search engine Google has also said it is working on a policy change to prevent websites that misrepresent content from using its AdSense advertising network In a blog post on Saturday, he wrote: 'Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99 percent of what people see is authentic. Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes.' Meanwhile, Fil Menczer, a professor of informatics and computing at Indiana University who has studied the spread of misinformation on social media, said Google's move with AdSense was a positive step. He said: 'One of the incentives for a good portion of fake news is money. This could cut the income that creates the incentive to create the fake news sites.' However, he cautioned that detecting fake news sites was not easy. He added: 'What if it is a site with some real information and some fake news? It requires specialized knowledge and having humans (do it) doesn't scale.'  Share or comment on this article e-mail 63 shares Most watched News videos Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Man discovers wife is cheating on him following her with drone Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Obama on Trump: This office has a way of waking you up SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Emotional Chelsea Handler fights back tears over election results 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing Obama's dig at Clinton over her ground game failures Pres.

False news stories have become a sore point after the U.S. presidential elections with critics blaming internet companies like Twitter and Facebook for having had an influence on the outcome of the elections as a result of the fake content. The controversy also reflects concerns about the growing power of social networks to influence people and events, as well as help people to communicate and organize. Facebook promotes democracy by letting candidates communicate directly with people, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said recently in an interview. Google had its own embarrassing moments on Sunday with a false story that claimed that President-elect Donald Trump had won the popular vote in the U.S. presidential elections figuring atop some Google search results. Trump’s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton is leading in the popular vote. “We've been working on an update to our publisher policies and will start prohibiting Google ads from being placed on misrepresentative content, just as we disallow misrepresentation in our ads policies,” Google said Monday in a statement. “Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property.” Google evidently expects that the threat of a cut in revenue from ads will dissuade sites from publishing fake content. Zuckerberg has described as “crazy” the criticism that fake news on Facebook's news feed had influenced the vote in favor of Trump. “Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99% of what people see is authentic. Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes,” Zuckerberg said in a post over the weekend. The hoaxes are not limited to one partisan view, or even to politics, he added. Identifying the "truth" is complicated, as while some hoaxes can be clearly identified, a greater amount of content, including from mainstream sources, often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted, or expresses a view that some people will disagree with and flag as incorrect even when it is factual, Zuckerberg wrote.

The product would be introduced in 2018 at the earliest, Bloomberg reported Monday, citing an unnamed source. The project is advanced enough to be in talks with suppliers, the report said. The smart glasses would be Apple's first in a category of product that was originally pioneered by Google with its Google Glass product. Like Google Glass, Apple's smart-glasses product would be geared toward information conveyance instead of immersive augmented-reality experiences like the products that Magic Leap is developing and Microsoft's HoloLens. Bloomberg cited sources saying the glasses "may use augmented reality." The project is in "early product testing," the Bloomberg report said. The smart glasses would be designed to connect to an iPhone for processing to keep their weight down and keep the design of the frames stylish without adding too many additional electronics. A main component of any pair of Apple smart glasses would be the lenses. Last week, Upload VR entrepreneur-in-residence Robert Scoble wrote in a Facebook post that Apple's optics partner was Carl Zeiss, which produces a lens called Zeiss Smart Optics. Thomas Alt, who joined Apple after the company bought Metaio, an AR company he was the CEO of, is listed as an inventor on a glasses patent assigned to Carl Zeiss. His LinkedIn profile lists him as "Director of Procurement, Strategic Deals Team" at Apple. A Zeiss representative declined to comment on any partnership with Apple. "I do think that a significant portion of the population of developed countries, and eventually all countries, will have AR experiences every day, almost like eating three meals a day, it will become that much a part of you," Apple CEO Tim Cook said last month in Utah. Apple develops many projects internally, and those efforts often do not ultimately result in a full product that goes on sale. Apple is working on integrating augmented reality into its software, and the glasses would most likely be its first hardware product targeted the AR market.

Google’s search engine is highlighting an inaccurate story claiming that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump won the popular vote in the Nov. 8, 2016, election, the latest example of bogus information spread by the internet’s gatekeepers. (Virginia Mayo, File/Associated Press) By Michael Liedtke | AP November 14 at 7:26 PM SAN FRANCISCO — Google’s search engine highlighted an inaccurate story claiming that President-elect Donald Trump won the popular vote in last week’s election, the latest example of bogus information spread by the internet’s gatekeepers. The incorrect results were shown Monday in a two-day-old story posted on the pro-Trump “70 News” site. A link to the site appeared at or near the top of Google’s influential rankings of relevant news stories for searches on the final election results. Google acknowledged the problem, although as of mid-afternoon Monday, the link to “70 News” remained prominent in its results. Although Google rarely removes content from its search results, the company is taking steps to punish sites that manufacture falsehoods. In a move disclosed Monday, Google says it will prevent its lucrative digital ads from appearing on sites that “misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information.” The action could give sites a bigger incentive to get things right or risk losing a valuable source of revenue. FAKE NEWS ON STEROIDS False information is nothing new on the internet, where debunkers have been batting down unfounded claims and urban legends for more than two decades. But the problem has gained more attention in the post-mortem of a bitterly contested presidential election in which Trump, a Republican billionaire and former reality TV star, defeated Hillary Clinton, a Democrat and former U.S. secretary of state who had been leading in the polls. Trump wound up prevailing in enough key states to win the Electoral College’s decisive vote, but is trailing Clinton in the overall popular vote with some ballots still being counted. Clinton’s lead in the popular vote has become one of the flashpoints in the protests against Trump’s election being staged in cities across the country. Google is just the latest company in the crosshairs. Fake news stories uncritically circulated during and after the election on Facebook have sparked a debate over the role of social media companies, which are key sources of news for large numbers of people. Critics suggest that these companies should be more careful to ensure they aren’t passing along misleading information. SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE NEWS Google’s dominant search engine is the leading source of traffic to media sites, according to the online analytics firm Chartbeat. Meanwhile, a study by the Pew Research Center found about 60 percent of Americans get at least some of their news from social media sites such as Facebook, which now has 178 million users in the U.S. and Canada. In the election’s aftermath, Facebook has been accused of possibly swaying the election’s outcome by promoting fake news stories on its social network. Last summer, the company fired a handful of journalists who oversaw its “trending” news list and replaced them with an algorithm; fake news stories quickly began to trend. CEO Mark Zuckerberg brushed off that criticism as “crazy “ in an appearance last week. He elaborated in a Saturday post on Facebook in which he asserted that “more than 99 percent of what people see” on Facebook is authentic. Zuckerberg conceded more needs to be done to block bogus information, but said that determining what’s blatantly wrong isn’t always an easy task. “Identifying the ‘truth’ is complicated,” Zuckerberg wrote. “While some hoaxes can be completely debunked, a greater amount of content, including from mainstream sources, often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted.” The stories featured in the feeds of Facebook users are primarily selected by automated formulas known as algorithms. Google’s search results are also powered by algorithms that the company regularly revises to thwart sites that attempt to artificially boost their prominence. MORE, BETTER ALGORITHMS? Google conceded its search engine misfired with the 70 News story that falsely declared Trump the popular vote winner in both its headline and the body of the text. “In this case we clearly didn’t get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms,” the company said in a statement. Bad information in an online headline or at the top of a story can be particularly damaging. Roughly 53 percent of the people who land on a web page stay for 15 seconds or less, according to Chartbeat’s findings. Incorrect information is bound to ripple across the internet as more people rely on their phones, computers and other digital devices to read news that is picked out for them by automated programs, said media analyst Ken Doctor of Newsonomics. “What we are seeing is the failure of the algorithm,” Doctor said. “These algorithms bring a lot of things into our lives that humans cannot do. But when algorithms fail, it highlights the fact that they are not just some kind of neutral technology. They are programmed by human beings and they have all the failings of human beings.” It’s difficult to know what happened when an algorithm goes awry because Google, Facebook and other internet companies closely guard how they work, much the way Coca-Cola protects the recipe for its soda. But the growing power that Google and Facebook hold over the flow of information could increase the political pressure for them to be held more accountable, Doctor said. In the meantime, most people remain skeptical about what they read online. Only 4 percent of Americans have a lot of confidence in what they read on social media sites, according to Pew. Local news organizations fared better in Pew Research’s survey earlier this year, with 22 percent of Americans saying they trusted the information there. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Daily Edition Login to download Google to Prohibit Fake News Sites From Using Its Ad Software 5:04 PM PST 11/14/2016 by Natalie Jarvey FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Justin Sullivan/Getty Images The search giant's move comes after a fake news article topped some search results on Sunday. Google is cracking down on fake-news sites.  The search giant plans to prohibit websites that publish false news from using its ad software, a product called Adsense that allows publishers to place Google ads on their websites.  Google's move, which will cut off a key revenue stream for these sites, comes as fake news has proliferated online, especially on Facebook, throughout the election. Google, too, has dealt with the rise of fake news. Several outlets have reported that on Sunday an inaccurate news story claiming that Donald Trump would win both the popular vote and the electoral college was the top result for some election-related searches.  On Monday, Google responded swiftly. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the move, says the changes are imminent and are in line with Google's existing policies.  A Google spokesperson sent the following statement to The Hollywood Reporter: "We've been working on an update to our publisher policies and will start prohibiting Google ads from being placed on misrepresentative content, just as we disallow misrepresentation in our ads policies. Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property." Facebook in particular saw the proliferation of fake news during the election, prompting some critics to question the role the social network played in helping Trump become elected. Last week, CEO Mark Zuckerberg called that notion "a pretty crazy idea." He then took to Facebook on Saturday to clarify his position, writing that "more than 99% of what people see is authentic. Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes."  BuzzFeed reported on Monday that some employees at the social network would like to see Facebook clamp down on fake-news posts. Quoting unnamed sources, the online outlet reported that a group of employees have formed a renegade task force whose goal is to offer recommendations to Facebook's senior management about how to handle fake news.  FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Natalie Jarvey Natalie.Jarvey@thr.com NatJarv Comments comments powered by Disqus The Hollywood Reporter © 2016 The Hollywood Reporter All rights reserved.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Pixel smartphone compromised again in white-hat hackathon By John Hoff - November 14, 2016 1 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter White-hat hacking contests are very helpful for software and hardware manufacturers alike. In events like these, they give huge amounts of money to those who can show them vulnerabilities that can be exploited either in hardware or software. PwnFest – held in Seoul, South Korea – was one such event and it was here that the Google Pixel was again compromised after being hacked in a similar contest a week ago. The end goal for contestants in these events is usually to gain control of a device through remote code execution. Here, Google’s brand spanking new flagship phone fell to hackers from Qihoo 360 who gained control of the smartphone via Chrome. The exploit resulted in the hackers able to take control of the device and launching Chrome which displayed a page that said, “Pwned By 360 Alpha Team”. The Qihoo 360 team won USD$120,000 as cash prize for that specific hack. The Chrome vulnerability was patched within 24 hours of the event. The week before, in a similar event in Japan, the Google Pixel was also compromised – that time via a zero-day exploit which is still unpatched up until time of writing. The team of white-hat hackers took home total prize money amounting to USD$520,000 – all for exposing vulnerabilities in devices and software, so that those companies can patch up those gaps and weaknesses in the security of their software of devices.

Coren Obsession 2016 November 14, 2016 No more dollars for fake news. (Reuters/Peter Power) Share Written by Michael J. Coren Obsession 2016 November 14, 2016 Silicon Valley is being forced to come to terms with the idea that it may bear some responsibility for the information passing through its servers. Google announced on Nov. 14 that it’s working on a policy that will restrict ads placed on fake news sites. A Google spokeswoman told Reuters that a policy change for its AdSense advertising network is imminent. “Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher’s content, or the primary purpose of the web property,” she said. AdSense is at the heart of many publishers’ revenue model. The statement did not give details on whether it would affect products such as DoubleClick that target and deliver ad campaigns, and the policy does not address hoaxes appearing in Google search results. The announcement comes as Facebook faces harsh criticism for allowing false information to be spread among its users ahead of the US presidential election. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has promised to “find ways for our community to tell us what content is most meaningful,” despite characterizing claims that the company had a significant role in the election’s outcome as a “pretty crazy idea.” That response has failed to impress, even to those inside Facebook. BuzzFeed reported today that a group of Facebook employees has formed to tackle the company’s role in promoting fake news on its own. “It’s not a crazy idea,” one Facebook engineer told Buzzfeed. “What’s crazy is for him to come out and dismiss it like that, when he knows, and those of us at the company know, that fake news ran wild on our platform during the entire campaign season.” Fake news sites that feed false, inflammatory information to a credulous American public have risen as a way to make easy money. In a BuzzFeed investigation, 140 websites dedicated to US politics were traced back to a small Macedonian town called Veles (population 45,000), where young men churned out stories “aggregated, or completely plagiarized, from fringe and right-wing sites in the US.” Since it’s cheap to register a domain, and set@an up shop overseas, junk sites like worldpoliticus.com, TrumpVision365.com, and USConservativeToday.com can be easily manufactured and unleashed on social media networks, where the clicks can be turned into revenue. Google itself has fallen victim to this type of news. Recent weeks have seen fake articles rise to the top of Google’s vaunted rankings, with obscure websites promoting the (false) idea that Trump is leading in the popular vote placing above reputable news organizations in searches. Reality is what people collectively believe. pic.twitter.com/KJANDTkUzA — Aza Raskin (@aza) November 14, 2016 Google’s attempt to cut off these sites from ad dollars won’t be easy, said Rob Leathern, founder of online advertising and payment software company Optimal. “The reason fake news sites exist is the advertising revenue,” he said in an interview. “But it’s not as easy as flicking a switch and turning off the revenue.” There are sites around the world are dedicated to circumventing Google’s controls. Unscrupulous owners can buy existing AdSense accounts online that may help evade the new policy. Simply determining if a site is “fake” will be a challenge. Since the financial incentive is there, it will be hard to stamp out. A fake viral news hit can rake in $1,000 or more in banner advertising dollars from ad networks run by Amazon.com, Google, and Revcontent, said Leathern, who analyzed fake news sites in a recent Medium post. And AdSense is only part of the online advertising ecosystem. As long as these sites continue to drive real traffic, they’ll likely be able to find ways to make money off them.

"Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property," a Google spokesperson told Reuters. According to The Wall Street Journal, Google said the policy would apply to fake news sites, a move that would cut them off from the world's biggest seller of pay-per-click ads and thus much of their income. The search giant told Reuters it began working on the policy update before the election. Concerns about fake news online, however, have intensified in recent days as commentators have slammed sites like Facebook and Google for facilitating the spread of misinformation to voters. On the day of Google's announcement, for instance, a false news story was returned as the top result for the search "final election results." That same day, Gizmodo reported that Facebook developed a tool to identify fake news stories and chose not to use it. Of course, it remains to be seen if Google will actually enforce the new policy. If it does, however, the search giant could strike a major blow against the growing fake news industry.

But the problem has gained more attention in the post-mortem of a bitterly contested presidential election in which Trump, a Republican billionaire and former reality TV star, defeated Hillary Clinton, a Democrat and former U.S. secretary of state who had been leading in the polls. A link to this story on 70 News appeared at or near the top of Google's influential rankings of relevant news stories for searches on the final election results — even though it's completely bogus. (CBC) Trump wound up prevailing in enough key states to win the Electoral College's decisive vote, but is trailing Clinton in the overall popular vote with some ballots still being counted. Clinton's lead in the popular vote has become one of the flashpoints in the protests against Trump's election being staged in cities across the country. Google is just the latest company in the crosshairs. Fake news stories uncritically circulated during and after the election on Facebook have sparked a debate over the role of social media companies, which are key sources of news for large numbers of people. Critics suggest that these companies should be more careful to ensure they aren't passing along misleading information. Only Facebook knows how it spreads fake election news Google's dominant search engine is the leading source of traffic to media sites, according to the online analytics firm Chartbeat. Meanwhile, a study by the Pew Research Center found about 60 per cent of Americans get at least some of their news from social media sites such as Facebook, which now has 178 million users in the U.S. and Canada. In the election's aftermath, Facebook has been accused of possibly swaying the election's outcome by promoting fake news stories on its social network. Last summer, the company fired a handful of journalists who oversaw its "trending" news list and replaced them with an algorithm; fake news stories quickly began to trend. 'Failure of the algorithms' Google conceded its search engine misfired with the 70 News story that falsely declared Trump the popular vote winner in both its headline and the body of the text. "In this case we clearly didn't get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms," the company said in a statement. Bad information in an online headline or at the top of a story can be particularly damaging. Roughly 53 per cent of the people who land on a web page stay for 15 seconds or less, according to Chartbeat's findings. 'When algorithms fail, it highlights the fact that they are not just some kind of neutral technology. They are programmed by human beings and they have all the failings of human beings.' - Ken Doctor, Newsonomics Incorrect information is bound to ripple across the internet as more people rely on their phones, computers and other digital devices to read news that is picked out for them by automated programs, said media analyst Ken Doctor of Newsonomics. "What we are seeing is the failure of the algorithm," Doctor said. "These algorithms bring a lot of things into our lives that humans cannot do. But when algorithms fail, it highlights the fact that they are not just some kind of neutral technology. They are programmed by human beings and they have all the failings of human beings." It's difficult to know what happened when an algorithm goes awry because Google, Facebook and other internet companies closely guard how they work, much the way Coca-Cola protects the recipe for its soda. But the growing power that Google and Facebook hold over the flow of information could increase the political pressure for them to be held more accountable, Doctor said. In the meantime, most people remain skeptical about what they read online. © The Associated Press, 2016 Report Typo or Error Send Feedback Stay Connected with CBC News Mobile Facebook Podcasts Twitter Alerts Newsletter Top News Headlines Royal Bank hikes mortgage rates — especially for loans of 25 years or longer read comments Liberals to revamp 'discriminatory' age law for anal intercourse video Energy companies' unpaid electric bills sent to Alberta farmers CBC News crew captures airstrikes in east Aleppo video Ottawa rabbi wakes to find swastika, racial slur spray-painted on her front door Latest Technology & Science News Headlines Twitter announces new features to curb cyberbullying Defibrillator-equipped drones could be 1st on scene in cardiac arrest Ban Ki-moon, Hollande call on U.S. to respect Paris climate deal Dakota Access pipeline delay a political tactic, company says Young scientists pen letter to Trudeau urging environmental assessment overhaul read comments Quirks & Quarks Quirks & Quarks for October 15, 2016 Cosmic rays causing ‘space brain,’ berries turning birds' feathers red, and the book 'Venomous' Quirks & Quarks for October 8, 2016 A Nobel prize winner in chemistry, theory of mind in apes, and diatoms save the ocean Most Viewed More than 412 million adult-website credentials hacked Google says it will crack down on fake news sites What you need to know about the supermoon Social media is blinding us to other points of view November supermoon will be the closest to Earth since 1948 Microsoft Surface Book review: Who needs a $4,000 laptop?

Google moves to restrict ads on fake news sites Reuters 15 hrs ago By Julia Love and Kristina Cooke © REUTERS/Pawel Kopczynski/File Photo A Google search page is seen through a magnifying glass in this file photo illustration taken in Berlin Alphabet Inc's Google said on Monday it is working on a policy change to prevent websites that misrepresent content from using its AdSense advertising network, a move aimed at halting the spread of "fake news" and other types of misinformation on the internet. The shift comes as Google, Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc face a backlash over the role they played in the U.S. presidential election by allowing the spread of false and often malicious information that might have swayed voters towards Republican candidate Donald Trump. The issue has provoked a fierce debate within Facebook especially, with Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg insisting twice in recent days that the site had no role in influencing the election. Google's move does not address the issue of fake news or hoaxes appearing in Google search results. That happened in the last few days, when a search for 'final election count' for a time took users to a fake news story saying Trump won the popular vote. Votes are still being counted, with Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton showing a slight lead. Nor does it suggest that the company has moved to a mechanism for rating the accuracy of particular articles. Rather, the change is aimed at assuring that publishers on the network are legitimate and eliminating the financial incentives that appear to have driven the production of much fake news. "Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property," Google said in a statement. The company did not detail how it would implement or enforce the new policy. MACEDONIA NEWS AdSense, which allows advertisers to place text ads on the millions of websites that are part of Google's network, is a major source of money for many publishers. A report in BuzzFeed News last month showed how tiny publishers in Macedonia were creating websites with fake news - much of it denigrating Clinton - which were widely shared on Facebook. That sharing in turn led people to click on links which brought them to the Macedonian websites, which could then make money on the traffic via AdSense. Facebook has been widely blamed for allowing the spread of online misinformation, most of it pro-Trump, but Zuckerberg has rejected the notion that Facebook influenced the outcome of the election or that fake news is a major problem on the service. "Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99 percent of what people see is authentic," he wrote in a blog post on Saturday. "Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes." Google has long had rules for its AdSense program, barring ads from appearing next to pornography or violent content. Work on the policy update announced on Monday began before the election, a Google spokeswoman said. The company uses a combination of humans and artificial intelligence to review sites that apply to be a part of AdSense, and sites continue to be monitored after they are accepted, a former Google employee who worked on ad systems said. Google's artificial intelligence systems learn from sites that have been removed from the programme, speeding the removal of similar sites. The issue of fake news is critical for Google from a business standpoint, as many advertisers do not want their brands to be touted alongside dubious content. Google must constantly hone its systems to try to stay one step ahead of unscrupulous publishers, the former employee said. Google has not said whether it believes its search algorithms, or its separate system for ranking results in the Google News service, also need to be modified to cope with the fake news issue. Fil Menczer, a professor of informatics and computing at Indiana University who has studied the spread of misinformation on social media, said Google's move with AdSense was a positive step. "One of the incentives for a good portion of fake news is money," he said. "This could cut the income that creates the incentive to create the fake news sites." However, he cautioned that detecting fake news sites was not easy. "What if it is a site with some real information and some fake news? It requires specialised knowledge and having humans (do it) doesn't scale," he said.

Xiaomi Mi Box review: Android TV elevated with cheap 4K HDR streaming At just $69 with 4K HDR, voice search, and Google Cast capabilities, the Mi Box is the first Android TV device with mainstream appeal. Jared Newman (TechHive (US)) on 14 November, 2016 23:00 0 - - - - print email Xiaomi’s Mi Box, the cheapest 4K HDR streaming box on the market, comes from two names you might not be familiar with. The box is built by Xiaomi, a Chinese electronics vendor that has largely avoided the U.S. market until now. As for the software, the Mi Box runs Android TV, a big-screen operating system Google launched a couple years ago, then promptly began neglecting in favor of the more popular Chromecast. The Xiaomi Mi Box is the first new Android TV streaming box since mid-2015, and it comes with a strong pitch: For $69, you get 4K HDR video, a voice-controlled remote, a speedy processor, and Google Cast built-in. That simple formula goes a long way toward covering up some of Android TV’s deficiencies. Svelte set-top, pointy remote The Mi Box is surprisingly compact, running four inches wide and deep, with a tapered design that’s about a quarter-inch thick. It’s smaller than the latest Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, and Roku Ultra and Premiere boxes, yet it has some robust tech specs including a 2.0 GHz quad-core processor, 8 GB of storage, 2 GB of RAM, and 802.11ac Wi-Fi. Apps load quickly, with no major performance hiccups even in heavyweight apps like PlayStation Vue. Xiaomi didn’t leave room for optical audio, but the box does include an output for headphones or S/PDIF audio connections. And while there’s no built-in ethernet port, the full-sized USB port supports USB-to-ethernet adapters, along with external storage drives and game controllers. Google has even been experimenting with USB tuner support in Android 7.0, which in the future could allow users to watch and record over-the-air antenna channels through the set-top box. Jared Newman The Mi Box has a USB port, HDMI output, and audio output for headphones and S/PDIF connections. The Mi Box can also stream in 4K at up to 60 frames per second, with HDR-10 to be enabled with Android 7.0, but you’re on your own to find supported content. There are no shortcuts to apps that offer Ultra HD video, akin to the “4K Spotlight” app on Roku players. And because Amazon Video isn’t supported on Android TV, one major source of 4K and HDR content is unavailable. (Current 4K sources include Netflix, YouTube, Vudu, Ultraflix, and Sony Ultra.) As for the remote control, Xiaomi aim for minimalism. There are no fast forward, rewind, or pause buttons—those functions are just built into the directional pad—nor are there menu or app shortcut buttons like you’d find on a Roku remote. However, the Mi Box remote does include volume controls, which you can adjust up to the maximum you’ve set on your TV, and a power button that puts the box to sleep. Those are worthy trade-offs in my view. My only grip is that the remote’s sharp edges can dig into your palms depending on how you hold it. The Android TV torchbearer Where the Mi Box starts to falter is with the Android TV operating system. Android TV is adequate at the basics, offering plenty of major streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, Sling TV, PlayStation Vue, HBO, Showtime, CBS All Access, Crackle, and Starz. (Some notable exceptions: Amazon Video, NBC, and NHL.TV.) Android TV also has built-in Google Cast support, which lets you launch videos from streaming apps on phones and tablets, and from websites in Google’s desktop Chrome browser. This helps fill in some gaps from Android TV’s native app catalog, and can be faster than thumbing through menus with a TV remote. Still, Google’s living room platform never rises above mere adequacy. It’s lacking the pleasant touches found on other streaming boxes, such as the private headphone listening on Roku’s remote controls and mobile app, or the Alexa virtual assistant built into Amazon’s Fire TV devices. Android TV also fails to execute on some of its more ambitious ideas. The Recommendations bar that sits atop the home screen is largely useless, with limited participation from streaming services, no sorting options, and a tendency among some apps to be clueless about what they’re suggesting. (WatchESPN, for instance, keeps offering days-old football reruns instead of live sporting events.) Android TV’s Live Channels app, which is supposed pull live video sources into a unified channel grid, is similarly stunted, with support from only six streaming apps. Sling TV and PlayStation Vue don’t make their live feeds available, and Pluto.tv channels consistently fail to load. Android TV’s Recommendations row is a smart idea that’s rarely useful in practice. Even Google seems to treat Android TV as an afterthought. There’s no Google Photos app on the Mi Box, YouTube’s design is out-of-date compared to other TV platforms, and the Google Play Music app lacks ad-supported radio stations. And while voice search is a powerful feature—supporting complex queries like “80s comedies” and showing results from across different apps—it could really use a visual overhaul to streamline the long list of results it generates. Better yet, it could act more like the virtual Assistant that’s built into the new Google Home connected speaker. One other caveat with the Mi Box in particular: It comes with some bloatware in form of 16 “Mi Box Recommends” app links. The apps aren’t all installed to begin with, and while they are removable, you have to install them before you can uninstall them. They also occupy a separate space from your main app list, making navigation a bit more confused. Pre-installed apps like Netflix aren’t allowed to mingle with your regular app lineup. Who’s the Mi Box for? At least for streaming devices like the Mi Box, Android TV still has the air of an enthusiast platform. Although it’s rough around the edges, but it allows tech-savvy users to sideload any Android app they want, and it supports the popular media player software Kodi. For gaming, you can install all kinds of console emulators to create your own retro gaming box. USB TV tuner support could also be a boon for cord cutters, assuming Google finalizes it, and Xiaomi upgrades the Mi Box to Android 7.0. The $69 Mi Box, however, is the first Android TV streamer whose appeal reaches beyond tech enthusiast circles. Though it fails to offer the flourishes and forward-thinking ideas of other streaming platforms, it succeeds as a cheap streaming device with 4K HDR video, solid performance, and voice search. Those same features would cost $30 more on a Roku, and Amazon’s $90 Fire TV doesn’t support HDR video at all. The Mi Box even matches the price of Google’s own Chromecast Ultra, while offering a proper remote and big-screen interface. On top of all that, you can buy the Mi Box at Walmart, the largest brick-and-mortar retailer in the United Sates. Maybe that’s enough to put Xiaomi—and Android TV—on the map.

Mark Zuckerberg said last week that he doesn’t think fake news swayed the election at all. And as Mediaite’s Dan Abrams wrote yesterday, a pretty glaring piece of fake news appeared when searching for the final Election 2016 vote count. Well, The Wall Street Journal reports today that Google plans to take action: Google said Monday that it is updating its policies to ban Google ads being placed “on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher’s content, or the primary purpose” of the website. The policy would include sites that distribute false news, a Google spokeswoman said. Meanwhile, over at Facebook, BuzzFeed has a report out tonight saying that there are Facebook employees who are setting up an “unofficial task force” to combat fake news. That task force is apparently very upset with Zuckerberg completely dismissing the impact of fake news on the election: “It’s not a crazy idea. What’s crazy is for him to come out and dismiss it like that, when he knows, and those of us at the company know, that fake news ran wild on our platform during the entire campaign season,” said one Facebook employee, who works in the social network’s engineering division. Zuckerberg said in a post this past weekend that he wants Facebook to do more to crack down on fake news. For the record, back in early 2015 Facebook said it was going to crack down on fake news. And now there are employees concerned that they haven’t done nearly enough: The group plans to formalize its meetings and eventually make a list of recommendations to Facebook’s senior management. Another Facebook employee said while the task force remained small, “hundreds” of Facebook employees had expressed dissatisfaction with the company’s stance on fake news in private online chats, and wanted to support efforts to challenge that position.

Most Popular Google last month quietly bought Undecidable Labs, a startup founded by a former Apple director that focused on turning online searches into purchases, according to a person familiar with the deal. The acquisition suggests that Google, the largest unit of Alphabet, is making further moves to tie its massive library of online image links with a revenue stream. Earlier efforts around online commerce have delivered mixed results at Google. The company's mobile payments have yet to see significant pickup. Its comparison shopping service, which facilitates online purchases within search results, has growing traction with advertisers, according to external estimates. Cathy Edwards, founder of Undecidable Labs, now oversees engineering and product development for image search at Google, a spokeswoman for the internet giant said on Monday. The representative declined to comment further. Undecidable Labs, based in San Francisco, had raised less than $1 million in financing, according to a person with knowledge of the startup. They asked not to be identified talking about private matters. Related Stories Alphabet Drops Starbucks Partnership, Slows Drone Project to Rein in Spending Rich Gets Richer: Google Parent Alphabet Reports Higher-Than-Expected Ad Sales Google Moves to Own More of the Online Shopping Experience Ms. Edwards spent two years as an engineering director at Apple, after the iPhone maker purchased her app search engine, Chomp, in 2012. She formed Undecidable Labs in early 2015. The company had yet to release a product. Stefanie Kraus, a designer listed as an employee of the startup, described its effort on her website as creating a "purchase research tool" for online shoppers. "By introducing a filtering system that takes `nice to have' and `ideal' into consideration, we make sure that the products are presented in a meaningful way," Ms. Kraus wrote on her website. Li Fan, who previously led engineering efforts for Google image search, left the company in September. She moved to Pinterest, the online discovery site that some analysts see as a viable contender for e-commerce spending and search advertising dollars now flowing to Google. -- Bloomberg News In this article: Digital Online Publishing Search Shopper Marketing Technology Become a Member Register Now Renew Membership Benefits Datacenter Advertising Age     Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Instagram YouTube Tumblr Copyright © 1994-2016 Crain Communications Privacy Statement Terms of Use About Us Advertise Reprints Contact Us AD AGE Creativity LookBook Datacenter Resources Events Jobs On Campus Site by AREA 17 x Scroll to Continue

The emphasis was intentional. Samsung’s target customers are carmakers who’d love to give their vehicles smartphone-like capabilities but are leery of surrendering unfettered access to their dashboards. They’ve largely kept a distance from Google, which could mine driver data for its own uses, or Apple Inc, which until recently had designs on building its own car. Samsung wants to marry its consumer electronics expertise and the fast 5G cellular network it’s developing with Harman’s presence in dashboards all over the world. If it works, they can offer carmakers a lightning-quick connected system for infotainment, mapping, concierge services and autonomous driving — and all without the worry that the automakers would be helping a future competitor. “This is not about building a car,” Young said in an interview. Several automakers “came to us and asked us to help with technologies like 5G, or artificial intelligence or memory. We can harness technologies to provide a better experience to automakers.” Samsung offered US$112 a share in cash for Harman, which was 28 per cent above the Stamford, Connecticut-based company’s closing price of US$87.65 in New York on Friday. The stock closed up 22 per cent to US$109.72, the biggest gain since its 1986 initial public offering. Samsung’s own shares rose on the deal, which was announced after the market closed yesterday. The stock climbed as much as 1.8 per cent as of 9:45am in Seoul. The acquisition reverberated through the car business, with Wells Fargo analyst David Lim saying in a research note that the deal could “ignite additional mergers and acquisitions of higher technology auto suppliers.” The shares of automotive electronics maker Visteon Corp. jumped 9.6 per cent — the most since August 2012 — and larger rival Delphi Automotive Plc gained 2.2 per cent. Deals like Samsung’s for Harman could be welcome by automakers, who want to control the revenue from connected car services and the customer data it generates as much as possible, said Jim Hines, a research director at Gartner. ‘Competitive dynamic’ “There is definitely a competitive dynamic that has emerged between the established automotive industry and these large tech companies that are looking to get a piece of that market opportunity,” Hines said. As automakers have rolled out connected services in their cars, they have been very careful in how they work with Google and Apple. General Motors Co allows its customers to connect their smartphones into the dashboard through Apple’s Car Play and Google’s Android Auto — but only with selected apps, and the phones cannot access a car’s data. Toyota Motor Corp. doesn’t allow its cars to connect to either system. The fear among carmakers is that Apple and Google could either mine the data inside the car, tracking everything from driving patterns to engine performance, to either become a new face to the consumer or to help them build cars. The fact that Harman is already a supplier and that Samsung doesn’t have a system that competes with the in-car connected services sold by carmakers could make them a more attractive partner, Hines said. Partner or threat? “They might be viewed as less of a threat in terms of tech partner for some of these leading automotive brands,” Hines said. Samsung wants to become a high-tech supplier capable of building connected systems. Its expertise is making the hardware, like microprocessing units, and a faster 5G network to deliver more data to cars faster. Harman sells — among other technologies — 3D navigation, apps for integrating other devices into the car, active safety systems and audio systems that can access the cloud. There are a lot of opportunities once the companies combine, Harman Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dinesh Paliwal said in a phone interview. Imagine a car that that can read a driver’s daily schedule and automatically dial into a conference call, Paliwal said. Autonomous driving will only give drivers access to more connected capabilities for work or entertainment, he said. “We’ll be in the best possible position because we have all the capabilities,” Paliwal said. Overcoming weaknesses Assuming the merger goes through, Samsung will need to develop other capabilities, especially in software, said Cyrus Mewawalla, lead analyst at CM Research. Like Google and Apple, Samsung wants to own and provide the servers, the hardware that’s doing all the computing and the memory storage for connected cars. They also want to own the platform that runs the apps, in the way that Apple’s iOS and Android do now. While they have expertise in some things like microprocessors, they don’t have all of those capabilities, Mewawalla said. “They’d need more than just this acquisition,” he said. “The two key weaknesses Samsung has is the software ecosystem and cloud infrastructure, and that’s where it needs to be acquiring.” Artificial intelligence, in which Samsung has recently made a deal, should be a particular area of focus in the near future, he added. If it chooses, the company could also have the resources to develop such capabilities on its own once Harman’s 8,000 software engineers and join Samsung, which spends US$13 billion a year on research and development and US$23 billion in capital expenditures. “Imagine the scale of our R&D,” Paliwal said. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Nepal PM phones India’s Modi over rupee chaos Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year United to delay taking Boeing jets in US$4.8b savings push Bursa Malaysia ends higher on window-dressing, higher oil prices Macau sets US$25b gaming target for 2017 below estimates Oil slumps as prospect of Trump victory roils global markets Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year Malaysia growth push stymied by banks cautious on loans US stocks decline after rally as election takes centre stage BNM: Ringgit fell against most world currencies in third quarter Most Watched Now Week MMOTV: Time to show up with daughter, Indira tells ex-husband NYT Video: ScienceTake — how dolphins know who’s who Reuters Video: Groin-flashing frog discovered in Australia Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Reuters Video: Philippines’ Duterte says ‘Long live Trump’ Did you know: The ocean is way deeper than you think Related Articles US stocks mixed as Samsung announces US$8b Harman deal (VIDEO) Samsung seeks redemption with AI-infused Galaxy S8 phone Samsung Electronics to invest more than US$1b in US chip production Samsung Electronics’ third quarter profit guidance beats estimates despite Note 7 woes Samsung targeted by activist investors to restructure company Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

BV Presents Events Election 2016 Google Play Music undergoes complete overhaul By BrooklynVegan Staff November 14, 2016 1:59 PM SHARE TWEET EMAIL REDDIT EMAIL REDDIT Google Play Music has recently undergone an overhaul in an attempt to stay competitive in the ongoing streaming wars. Google’s attempt to stick out involves a proposed huge degree of personalization, with the Google Now features that revolve around personal recommendations being applied to the streaming service. Via The Verge: Using machine learning and clues like location, activity, and weather, the app tries to serve up a smorgasbord of playlists that will match your mood and moment. “At a high level, Google’s mission is to make the world of information really accessible and useful to people,” said Elias Roman, the lead product manager for Google Play Music. Google Now might do that by suggesting you leave for the airport early to avoid bad traffic on the highway. “There is a role for Google to play in music that is similar.” Every time you open the app, it completely refreshes what you see, trying to serve the perfect selection. Tapping the app on Saturday night I got options for a cocktail party playlist and some serious dancehall jams. When I opened it again late Sunday afternoon, I got offered a playlist for relaxing at home and another for cooking dinner. The interface, based on cards, feels a lot like Google Now, and so does the approach to just-in-time doses of pertinent information, in this case the tunes you need. That sounds not unlike the now-defunct Beats Music, and it makes sense for complete personalization to be a selling point for Google given how their other products try to aim directly at the user. Have you used the new Google Play music app? How is it?

Google, too, has dealt with the rise of fake news. Several outlets have reported that on Sunday an inaccurate news story claiming that Donald Trump would win both the popular vote and the electoral college was the top result for some election-related searches.  On Monday, Google responded swiftly. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the move, says the changes are imminent and are in line with Google's existing policies.  A Google spokesperson sent the following statement to The Hollywood Reporter: "We've been working on an update to our publisher policies and will start prohibiting Google ads from being placed on misrepresentative content, just as we disallow misrepresentation in our ads policies. Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property." Facebook in particular saw the proliferation of fake news during the election, prompting some critics to question the role the social network played in helping Trump become elected. Last week, CEO Mark Zuckerberg called that notion "a pretty crazy idea." He then took to Facebook on Saturday to clarify his position, writing that "more than 99% of what people see is authentic. Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes."  BuzzFeed reported on Monday that some employees at the social network would like to see Facebook clamp down on fake-news posts. Quoting unnamed sources, the online outlet reported that a group of employees have formed a renegade task force whose goal is to offer recommendations to Facebook's senior management about how to handle fake news.  Read more: Mark Zuckerberg Says It's "Crazy" to Think Facebook Influenced the Election Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next Obama says Trump soon to face sobering 'reality' check AFP Melania Trump Wore a $1,655 Fiery Red Dress for 60 Minutes Interview Lauren Tuck Black veteran says he was refused free Veteran's Day meal at Chili's after man in Trump shirt questioned his service Business Insider President Obama suggests Hillary Clinton is to blame for stunning election loss International Business Times UK What You Need to Know About Jared Kushner Town & Country Obama: World must guard against ‘crude’ nationalism, racism Yahoo News Stunning photos of the supermoon Yahoo News Video Ohio State student arrested after tackling anti-Trump speaker Yahoo News Miami Marlins Jose Fernandez dies in boating accident Yahoo News Photo Staff Where Are They Now?

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Google to treat fake-news websites like porn and ban its ads from them By Ethan Baron / November 14, 2016 at 5:19 PM What you read here is true. Unfortunately, the same can’t be said for the rest of the internet. Although the web has been serving up fake news since its inception, the rise of social media has fueled a rise in the number of websites that acquire revenue-generating traffic via outrageous and often false stories shared widely on social media. The most recent presidential campaign brought this issue into the light, with Facebook taking significant heat over made-up news stories in its news feed. And on Nov. 14, Google felt some of the fire as well: Searches for “election results” brought up, in the top position, a false report by “an obscure right-wing blog” that President-elect Donald Trump won the popular vote. But Google is now taking a stand against fake news. The company’s AdSense program connects website operators with advertisers, and is “the most popular tool for monetizing websites,” according to the Wall Street Journal. But AdSense also “helps fund some fake-news sites,” the Journal reported. Now, Google is putting together a policy update that will keep its ads off fake news sites, the firm told Reuters. “Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher’s content, or the primary purpose of the web property,” Google spokeswoman Andrea Faville told Reuters, adding that the change was imminent. The new policy will put fake news into what might be described as Google’s basket of deplorables: types of websites the company doesn’t want its ads running on. “Google has long prohibited AdSense from being used on sites that promote hate speech or include pornography and violent content,” according to the Journal. “Its policies previously didn’t include language about sites that spread false content.” A spokeswoman told the paper that the new policy would parallel existing bans on ads that misrepresent what they’re selling. In other real news about fake news, California assemblywoman Melissa Melendez (Lake Elsinore) apparently prefers the latter and disdains the purveyors of the former. The Republican politician, revealed to have tweeted a link to a fake report about anti-Trump protesters fatally injuring a veteran. The website in question, the Christian Times Newspaper, has also presented articles saying that Hillary Clinton had filed for divorce and that she and her husband Bill were “actively involved in child sex trafficking,” the Los Angeles Times reported.   But it wasn’t the fake-news site Melendez took aim at when she was called out for tweeting a link to falsehood. She instead took a shot at purported bias in the mainstream media. “I had a bet with my husband that liberal reporters would flip out over a news story I shared. I won $20 thanks libs,” she tweeted, according to the Los Angeles Times. Photo: A man walks past a building on the Google campus in Mountain View.

Starting this week, the company's Google Play Music streaming service will begin to use it, as well. Google's newly revamped Google Play Music will leverage machine learning techniques to first figure out an individual listener's music tastes and preferences. The app will then combine other factors like time of the day. user location, activity and weather to suggest what it judges to be the most appropriate music for that situation. Google Play Music will serve up different, customized playlists depending on whether the listener is at work, relaxing at home, working out, flying, or in the library. "Your workout music is front and center as you walk into the gym, a sunset soundtrack appears just as the sky goes pink, and tunes for focusing turn up at the library," explained Elias Roman, lead project manager for Google Play Music in a blog post. Google Play Music will serve up the music suggestions via a new home page that is customized for listeners based on music preferences. The goal is to ensure that the music that a user is most likely going to want to listen to at any moment is always on top of their home screen. Like many other mobile applications and services from Google and other developers, Google Play Music will be available in an offline mode when the user is not connected to the Internet or is in a location with poor connectivity. In such instances, subscribers to the server will get an offline playlist populated with recently listened to songs, The new Google Play Music will start becoming available to subscribers this week. It will be available on Android iOS and the Web version of Google Play Music. The updated app is being rolled out on a global basis and will be available in more than four dozen countries initially. Google Play Music service allows users to load up to 50,000 songs from their devices to the cloud from where they can play it anytime on any Android, iOS and Web accessible device from anywhere around the world. The service boasts a 35 million-song catalog across a wide variety of genres. Music listeners, who sign up for the $9.99 per month—or $14.99 per month per family per month—service get full, ad-free access to the catalog. People who subscribe to Play Music also get access to YouTube Red, Google's ad-free video and gaming service. At least some of the features that Google announced this week were previously available through Songza, an online music streaming service that Google acquired in 2014 for an undisclosed sum. Songza gave users the ability to listen to contextual playlists curated by experts and boasted of the ability to serve up song ideas based on location, time of day, activity and similar factors, just like Google announced this week. Google maintained Songza as a separate music streaming service until last December when the company folded it into Google Play Music.           LATEST MOBILE ARTICLES   Revamped Google Play Music to Use Machine Learning to Suggest Songs Google Rebuts EU Complaint About Android Bundling Charges GoPro Recalls All 2,500 of the New Karma Drones Sold to Customers Google Gives Gmail for iOS Major Overhaul NXP Unveils New Technologies for Autonomous Vehicles                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

(Photo: Justin Sullivan, Getty Images) 313 CONNECTTWEET 9 LINKEDIN 27 COMMENTEMAILMORE SAN FRANCISCO — Facebook isn't the only source of fake news on the Web. Alphabet's Google was dragged into the muck Monday, when its search engine prominently displayed an obscure right-wing blog, 70news.wordpress.com, that falsely claimed President-elect Donald Trump won the popular vote in last week's election.  (Hillary Clinton leads Trump by nearly 700,000 votes, but Trump won in the Electoral College, according to the Associated Press.) "The goal of Search is to provide the most relevant and useful results for our users. In this case we clearly didn’t get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms," Google spokeswoman Maggie Shiels said in a email statement. The results popped up under a Google search banner called  "In the News" when a user searched for "who won the popular vote." As of Monday evening, the blog's post was still there, though it followed stories that referenced the erroneous results. In the News is different from Google News (news.google.com.) The blog's publisher said it had based its information on "twitter posts" over the weekend, specifically one from user @koxingA8. The dust-up, on the heels of criticism that Facebook was a breeding ground for misinformation during the run-up to the presidential election, is more fodder for a national debate on the responsibility of social media and other types of technology that broadly disseminate information to billions of people worldwide. Most news carried on Google's search engine comes from established media sources such as the New York Times and CNN, according to data analysis from journalists at the University of Maryland. Later Monday, Google said it would remove sites it had found to be providing fake news from its advertising program. The erroneous blog post is sure to give technology another black eye in what has been mounting criticism about its propensity to amplify misleading information across broad digital platforms. Facebook has been assailed for prominently featuring fake news on its site, prompting CEO Mark Zuckerberg to deny it unwittingly helped Trump become president-elect. He said 99% of news on the social network is "authentic," and has vowed to weed out fake news. Late Monday, the company said it would pull ads from fake news sites. USA TODAY Facebook employees form fake news task force “In accordance with the Audience Network Policy, we do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news," Facebook said in a statement. "While implied, we have updated the policy to explicitly clarify that this applies to fake news. Our team will continue to closely vet all prospective publishers and monitor existing ones to ensure compliance." USA TODAY Zuckerberg vows to weed out Facebook 'fake news' A group of Facebook employees, meanwhile, have formed an unofficial task force to refute Zuckerberg's claim that the company bears no responsibility for the spread of fake news, according to a BuzzFeed News report.

However, the Chinese company reportedly turned Google down because the search giant insisted that its brand should be the only one adorning the Pixels. When Huawei execs heard that the Huawei logo wouldn't be on the phones, they turned Google down. That was all rumored information, however, up until now. German publication WinFuture spoke to Colin Giles, Huawei's Vice President of the Consumer Business Group, about the matter. And he pretty much confirmed the earlier report. Simply put, the fact that Google wanted the Pixels to only bear its own brand was found unacceptable by Huawei, a company that is striving to make its name more well known in developed markets. That aim would not have been helped in any way if Huawei were to act as a mere contract manufacturer for the Google Pixel phones, so the company chose not to further the hardware development cooperation it started with Google last year, when working on the Nexus 6P. Interestingly, Giles says Huawei doesn't see Google as a direct competitor. Of course, if the Pixel line becomes even remotely successful sales-wise, that perception may change.

The tech giant is set to punish websites violating its Safe Browsing standards by applying a “Repeat Offender” tag, eweek reported. The change, announced in a Google blog post on Nov. 8, is set to begin this week for users of Google Chrome and other browsers. The warning will remain in place for a month and only be taken down if Google believes the site no longer poses a threat. The “Repeat Offender” tag was developed to combat sites that are intentionally harmful and duplicitous. In the past, those sites would typically remove the security issue after being flagged by Google – but just for long enough to get the Safe Browsing warning removed. Then the initial security issue would pop back up. “As a result of this gap in user protection, we have adjusted our policies to reduce risks borne by end-users,” Brooke Heinichen, a member of the Safe Browsing Team, wrote in the Google blog post. Safe Browsing has been available to users on desktop and Android systems since December. More than 2 billion Internet-connected devices worldwide are protected by Safe Browsing, DigitalTrends reported.

We have reviews of Google's Daydream View and the new Surface Book laptop, plus a "perfect" mobile game called "RunGunJumpGun." Childhood nostalgia incomingThe NES Classic Edition has arrived Nintendo's miniaturized NES emulator is officially on sale today. The $60 hunk of nostalgia will be sold on Amazon at 2PM ET, so set a reminder if you can't stop by a local Best Buy, Gamestop or Target to pick one up. Even if you don't buy one immediately, expect more impressions from us soon. The laptop to beat doesn't come cheapReview: Surface Book (2016) This year's Surface Book has very few flaws. It's well-crafted and has a comfortable keyboard, a vibrant screen, fast performance and even longer battery life than last year's model. As ever, you'll pay dearly for the privilege, and the relatively heavy weight and imbalanced weight distribution make it less portable than lighter systems. With that heft, though, comes incredible battery life and no shortage of port options. It doesn't completely reinvent mobile VR, but it's a good stepReview: Google's Daydream View VR headset Google's Daydream View is here, and it's a solid first attempt at a mobile VR headset from the company that gave us Android. Importantly, it's comfortable, and VR experiences look great. The only problem is there aren't many apps available for it yet -- and we need more Daydream-compatible phones. At the moment, users are limited to Google's own Pixel handsets. Daydream streamerYouTube's VR app is Daydream-only for now Now that Google's VR platform is available, it's launched the official VR app for YouTube. You'll need the new phone and headset to access it, since it's not on any other platforms yet, but now you can watch anything from the streaming site in its virtual confines. That includes 360-degree videos, or just regular stuff projected on an imaginary screen, along with voice search and all your existing subscriptions.

The incorrect results were shown Monday in a two-day-old story posted on the pro-Trump "70 News" site. A link to the site appeared at or near the top of Google's influential rankings of relevant news stories for searches on the final election results. Google acknowledged the problem, although as of mid-afternoon Monday, the link to "70 News" remained prominent in its results. Although Google rarely removes content from its search results, the company is taking steps to punish sites that manufacture falsehoods. In a move disclosed Monday, Google says it will prevent its lucrative digital ads from appearing on sites that "misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information." The action could give sites a bigger incentive to get things right or risk losing a valuable source of revenue. FAKE NEWS ON STEROIDS False information is nothing new on the internet, where debunkers have been batting down unfounded claims and urban legends for more than two decades. But the problem has gained more attention in the post-mortem of a bitterly contested presidential election in which Trump, a Republican billionaire and former reality TV star, defeated Hillary Clinton, a Democrat and former U.S. secretary of state who had been leading in the polls. Trump wound up prevailing in enough key states to win the Electoral College's decisive vote, but is trailing Clinton in the overall popular vote with some ballots still being counted. Clinton's lead in the popular vote has become one of the flashpoints in the protests against Trump's election being staged in cities across the country. Google is just the latest company in the crosshairs. Fake news stories uncritically circulated during and after the election on Facebook have sparked a debate over the role of social media companies, which are key sources of news for large numbers of people. Critics suggest that these companies should be more careful to ensure they aren't passing along misleading information. SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE NEWS Google's dominant search engine is the leading source of traffic to media sites, according to the online analytics firm Chartbeat. Meanwhile, a study by the Pew Research Center found about 60 percent of Americans get at least some of their news from social media sites such as Facebook, which now has 178 million users in the U.S. and Canada. In the election's aftermath, Facebook has been accused of possibly swaying the election's outcome by promoting fake news stories on its social network. Last summer, the company fired a handful of journalists who oversaw its "trending" news list and replaced them with an algorithm; fake news stories quickly began to trend. CEO Mark Zuckerberg brushed off that criticism as "crazy " in an appearance last week. He elaborated in a Saturday post on Facebook in which he asserted that "more than 99 percent of what people see" on Facebook is authentic. Zuckerberg conceded more needs to be done to block bogus information, but said that determining what's blatantly wrong isn't always an easy task. "Identifying the 'truth' is complicated," Zuckerberg wrote. "While some hoaxes can be completely debunked, a greater amount of content, including from mainstream sources, often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted." The stories featured in the feeds of Facebook users are primarily selected by automated formulas known as algorithms. Google's search results are also powered by algorithms that the company regularly revises to thwart sites that attempt to artificially boost their prominence. MORE, BETTER ALGORITHMS? Google conceded its search engine misfired with the 70 News story that falsely declared Trump the popular vote winner in both its headline and the body of the text. "In this case we clearly didn't get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms," the company said in a statement. Bad information in an online headline or at the top of a story can be particularly damaging. Roughly 53 percent of the people who land on a web page stay for 15 seconds or less, according to Chartbeat's findings. Incorrect information is bound to ripple across the internet as more people rely on their phones, computers and other digital devices to read news that is picked out for them by automated programs, said media analyst Ken Doctor of Newsonomics. "What we are seeing is the failure of the algorithm," Doctor said. "These algorithms bring a lot of things into our lives that humans cannot do. But when algorithms fail, it highlights the fact that they are not just some kind of neutral technology. They are programmed by human beings and they have all the failings of human beings." It's difficult to know what happened when an algorithm goes awry because Google, Facebook and other internet companies closely guard how they work, much the way Coca-Cola protects the recipe for its soda. But the growing power that Google and Facebook hold over the flow of information could increase the political pressure for them to be held more accountable, Doctor said. In the meantime, most people remain skeptical about what they read online. Only 4 percent of Americans have a lot of confidence in what they read on social media sites, according to Pew. Local news organizations fared better in Pew Research's survey earlier this year, with 22 percent of Americans saying they trusted the information there. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Google's search results are also powered by algorithms that the company regularly revises to thwart sites that attempt to artificially boost their prominence. More, better algorithms? Google conceded its search engine misfired with the 70 News story that falsely declared Trump the popular vote winner in both its headline and the body of the text. "In this case we clearly didn't get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms," the company said in a statement. Bad information in an online headline or at the top of a story can be particularly damaging. Roughly 53 percent of the people who land on a web page stay for 15 seconds or less, according to Chartbeat's findings. Incorrect information is bound to ripple across the internet as more people rely on their phones, computers and other digital devices to read news that is picked out for them by automated programs, said media analyst Ken Doctor of Newsonomics. "What we are seeing is the failure of the algorithm," Doctor said. "These algorithms bring a lot of things into our lives that humans cannot do. But when algorithms fail, it highlights the fact that they are not just some kind of neutral technology. They are programmed by human beings and they have all the failings of human beings." It's difficult to know what happened when an algorithm goes awry because Google, Facebook and other internet companies closely guard how they work, much the way Coca-Cola protects the recipe for its soda. But the growing power that Google and Facebook hold over the flow of information could increase the political pressure for them to be held more accountable, Doctor said. In the meantime, most people remain skeptical about what they read online. Only 4 percent of Americans have a lot of confidence in what they read on social media sites, according to Pew. Local news organizations fared better in Pew Research's survey earlier this year, with 22 percent of Americans saying they trusted the information there.

The incorrect results were shown Monday in a two-day-old story posted on the pro-Trump “70 News” site. A link to the site appeared at or near the top of Google’s influential rankings of relevant news stories for searches on the final election results. Google acknowledged the problem, although as of mid-afternoon Monday, the link to “70 News” remained prominent in its results. Although Google rarely removes content from its search results, the company is taking steps to punish sites that manufacture falsehoods. In a move disclosed Monday, Google says it will prevent its lucrative digital ads from appearing on sites that “misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information.” The action could give sites a bigger incentive to get things right or risk losing a valuable source of revenue. FAKE NEWS ON STEROIDS False information is nothing new on the internet, where debunkers have been batting down unfounded claims and urban legends for more than two decades. But the problem has gained more attention in the post-mortem of a bitterly contested presidential election in which Trump, a Republican billionaire and former reality TV star, defeated Hillary Clinton, a Democrat and former U.S. secretary of state who had been leading in the polls. Trump wound up prevailing in enough key states to win the Electoral College’s decisive vote, but is trailing Clinton in the overall popular vote with some ballots still being counted. Clinton’s lead in the popular vote has become one of the flashpoints in the protests against Trump’s election being staged in cities across the country. Google is just the latest company in the crosshairs. Fake news stories uncritically circulated during and after the election on Facebook have sparked a debate over the role of social media companies, which are key sources of news for large numbers of people. Critics suggest that these companies should be more careful to ensure they aren’t passing along misleading information. SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE NEWS Google’s dominant search engine is the leading source of traffic to media sites, according to the online analytics firm Chartbeat. Meanwhile, a study by the Pew Research Center found about 60 per cent of Americans get at least some of their news from social media sites such as Facebook, which now has 178 million users in the U.S. and Canada. In the election’s aftermath, Facebook has been accused of possibly swaying the election’s outcome by promoting fake news stories on its social network. Last summer, the company fired a handful of journalists who oversaw its “trending” news list and replaced them with an algorithm; fake news stories quickly began to trend. CEO Mark Zuckerberg brushed off that criticism as “crazy ” in an appearance last week. He elaborated in a Saturday post on Facebook in which he asserted that “more than 99 per cent of what people see” on Facebook is authentic. Zuckerberg conceded more needs to be done to block bogus information, but said that determining what’s blatantly wrong isn’t always an easy task. “Identifying the ‘truth’ is complicated,” Zuckerberg wrote. “While some hoaxes can be completely debunked, a greater amount of content, including from mainstream sources, often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted.” The stories featured in the feeds of Facebook users are primarily selected by automated formulas known as algorithms. Google’s search results are also powered by algorithms that the company regularly revises to thwart sites that attempt to artificially boost their prominence. MORE, BETTER ALGORITHMS? Google conceded its search engine misfired with the 70 News story that falsely declared Trump the popular vote winner in both its headline and the body of the text. “In this case we clearly didn’t get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms,” the company said in a statement.

 Apple is working on smart glasses Kif Leswing Nov. 14, 2016, 7:00 PM 9,809 facebook linkedin twitter email print Not a real photo of Tim Cook. AP / Matthew Sumner for Getty Images Apple is working on a pair of smart glasses. The product would be introduced in 2018 at the earliest, Bloomberg reported Monday, citing an unnamed source. The project is advanced enough to be in talks with suppliers, the report said. The smart glasses would be Apple's first in a category of product that was originally pioneered by Google with its Google Glass product. Like Google Glass, Apple's smart-glasses product would be geared toward information conveyance instead of immersive augmented-reality experiences like the products that Magic Leap is developing and Microsoft's HoloLens. Bloomberg cited sources saying the glasses "may use augmented reality." The project is in "early product testing," the Bloomberg report said. The smart glasses would be designed to connect to an iPhone for processing to keep their weight down and keep the design of the frames stylish without adding too many additional electronics. A main component of any pair of Apple smart glasses would be the lenses. Last week, Upload VR entrepreneur-in-residence Robert Scoble wrote in a Facebook post that Apple's optics partner was Carl Zeiss, which produces a lens called Zeiss Smart Optics. Thomas Alt, who joined Apple after the company bought Metaio, an AR company he was the CEO of, is listed as an inventor on a glasses patent assigned to Carl Zeiss. His LinkedIn profile lists him as "Director of Procurement, Strategic Deals Team" at Apple. A Zeiss representative declined to comment on any partnership with Apple. "I do think that a significant portion of the population of developed countries, and eventually all countries, will have AR experiences every day, almost like eating three meals a day, it will become that much a part of you," Apple CEO Tim Cook said last month in Utah. Apple develops many projects internally, and those efforts often do not ultimately result in a full product that goes on sale. Apple is working on integrating augmented reality into its software, and the glasses would most likely be its first hardware product targeted the AR market.

The decision comes at a critical time for the tech industry, whose key players have come under fire for not taking neccesary steps to prevent fake news from proliferating across the web during the 2016 US election. It’s thought that, given the viral aspects of fake news, social networks and search engines were gamed by partisan bad actors intending to influence the outcome of the race. Fake news easily goes viral, and Silicon Valley is letting it happen unabated "Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property," a Google spokesperson said in a statement given to Reuters. This policy includes fake news sites, the spokesperson confirmed. Google already prevents its AdSense program from being used by sites that promote violent videos and imagery, pornography, and hate speech. The issue of fake news on social media grabbed national attention earlier this summer, when Gizmodo reported that the team at Facebook responsible for its Trending Topics news list was suppressing links from conservative sources. The controversy called into question Facebook’s role as a primary source of news for tens of millions of Americans. The episode reportedley “paralyzed” Facebook, according to a recent report from The New York Times, leaving its leadership unwilling to make any drastic changes to the News Feed to curb the viral growth of fake news. Zuckerberg says it’s ‘crazy’ to think Facebook influenced the election In fact, earlier today Gizmodo reported that Facebook had developed a tool to identify fake news on its platform, but chose not to deploy it for fear it would disproportionately affect conservative websites and cause more right-wing backlash. As it stands, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has denied his company’s role in influencing the election, calling the idea “crazy” and downplaying yet again the characterization of Facebook as a media company. Google appears to be taking a more active role, and for good reason. Just this past weekend, a fake news link rose to the top of Google search results for the question “who won the popular vote,” falsely claiming the answer to be President-elect Donald Trump. Now, it seems those sites that have learned to game the search and social network algorithms of Silicon Valley’s most influential companies may lose a crucial source of funding going forward. - Source: Reuters In this Storystream How social platforms influenced the 2016 election Facebook employees reportedly forming secret ‘task force’ to address fake news Google will soon ban fake news sites from using its ad network What we know, and what we don’t, about Facebook’s effort to reduce hoaxes View all 17 stories More From The Verge China's right: smartphones are a big reason Trump can't win a trade war Donald Trump is about to control the most powerful surveillance machine in history A Tribe Called Quest’s new album is tear-jerking, essential protest music Watch Dogs 2 is exactly what the original game should have been Predicting Westworld: so it’s Lost MacBook Pro with Touch Bar review: a touch of the future Now Trending MacBook Pro with Touch Bar review: a touch of the future WhatsApp opens up video calling to everyone The Walking Dead Redemption Club season 7, episode 4: Service This Article has a component height of 10.

(Photo: Justin Sullivan, Getty Images) 313 CONNECTTWEET 9 LINKEDIN 27 COMMENTEMAILMORE SAN FRANCISCO — Facebook isn't the only source of fake news on the Web. Alphabet's Google was dragged into the muck Monday, when its search engine prominently displayed an obscure right-wing blog, 70news.wordpress.com, that falsely claimed President-elect Donald Trump won the popular vote in last week's election.  (Hillary Clinton leads Trump by nearly 700,000 votes, but Trump won in the Electoral College, according to the Associated Press.) "The goal of Search is to provide the most relevant and useful results for our users. In this case we clearly didn’t get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms," Google spokeswoman Maggie Shiels said in a email statement. The results popped up under a Google search banner called  "In the News" when a user searched for "who won the popular vote." As of Monday evening, the blog's post was still there, though it followed stories that referenced the erroneous results. In the News is different from Google News (news.google.com.) The blog's publisher said it had based its information on "twitter posts" over the weekend, specifically one from user @koxingA8. The dust-up, on the heels of criticism that Facebook was a breeding ground for misinformation during the run-up to the presidential election, is more fodder for a national debate on the responsibility of social media and other types of technology that broadly disseminate information to billions of people worldwide. Most news carried on Google's search engine comes from established media sources such as the New York Times and CNN, according to data analysis from journalists at the University of Maryland. Later Monday, Google said it would remove sites it had found to be providing fake news from its advertising program. The erroneous blog post is sure to give technology another black eye in what has been mounting criticism about its propensity to amplify misleading information across broad digital platforms. Facebook has been assailed for prominently featuring fake news on its site, prompting CEO Mark Zuckerberg to deny it unwittingly helped Trump become president-elect. He said 99% of news on the social network is "authentic," and has vowed to weed out fake news. Late Monday, the company said it would pull ads from fake news sites. USA TODAY Facebook employees form fake news task force “In accordance with the Audience Network Policy, we do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news," Facebook said in a statement. "While implied, we have updated the policy to explicitly clarify that this applies to fake news. Our team will continue to closely vet all prospective publishers and monitor existing ones to ensure compliance." USA TODAY Zuckerberg vows to weed out Facebook 'fake news' A group of Facebook employees, meanwhile, have formed an unofficial task force to refute Zuckerberg's claim that the company bears no responsibility for the spread of fake news, according to a BuzzFeed News report.

Of course depending on your skill and how you judge distance and space, you could make a three-point turn, or you might even up taking more turns, like 5 or 7, but basically there is skill involved. Recently it seems that this is a skill that Google has taught its self-driving cars. In their monthly report that Google releases to keep the public informed of their progress, Google revealed that the three-point turn is a skill that their self-driving cars have recently managed to master, thanks to bevy of cameras and sensors placed around the vehicle that helps them see things that human drivers might otherwise miss. According to Google, “Our self-driving cars, on the other hand, can see a full 360 degrees, measure distance down to a few centimeters, and precisely calculate the quickest path for the car. Our cars don’t just follow a few standard turns either. We’ve taught them to adapt to all kinds of variables — including dead end streets stacked with parked cars, trash bins littered on the curbs, and narrow bottlenecks.” Google also noted how they wanted to make it so that their cars would perform the turns naturally, as in how a human driver would do it, which is why they have opted to use maneuvers that humans would do as opposed to doing something a robot might, like going back and forth in small and short movements, or reversing all the way.

The policy change is imminent, Google spokeswoman Andrea Faville told Reuters. "Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property," she said in a statement. The policy change comes amid an intensifying debate over how much responsibility technology companies bear for monitoring the accuracy of content as more and more people access news through sites such as Facebook rather than traditional media companies. Facebook, in particular, has been criticized over the spread of inaccurate articles promoting U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on the site. Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has denied that the site influenced the outcome of the election. Google's AdSense advertising network is a key financial driver for many publishers. The company places various restrictions on where its ads may be placed, including bans on pornographic and violent content. Work on the policy update began before the election, Faville said.

So why not your favorite operating system? Apparently, Google thought so too… It’s a big and expanding social network, after all, and a presence there is only going to strengthen the Google property’s image across the board. It is not exactly clear what the company plans to do to promote itself, however, as only six uploads have so far been made. The bio reads “A grid of sweet treats and #AndroidAdventures,” which suggests that it could be used for virtually anything Android-related. Other than the obligatory “Hello world” shot, the six pictures have been posted so to make up one big, singular header, where a few of Google’s initiatives are featured. We can see a Nexus 6P as well as a Pixel smartphone and a Pixel C, a few Android Wear watches and services like Pay and Auto scattered all throughout. There are also a few jelly beans, lollipops, marshmallows and nougat bites — sorry, no Android O hints just yet. The weirdest thing seems the profile picture, where the signature android is holding a Nexus 6P rather than a Pixel. But this is Google we’re talking about, so on second thought there’s nothing to be really shocked about. Guides Android Breaking news for Android. Get the latest on apps, carriers, devices, and more!

The company’s co-founder and CEO, Cathy Edwards, is now head of engineering and product development for image search at Google, according to the report, a change which is reflected on her LinkedIn profile. Edwards was previously an Apple engineer… Little is known about the under-the-radar startup, other than that it “focused on turning online searches into purchases” and that it “raised less than $1 million in financing” before being snatched up by the Mountain View company (via Bloomberg). The report suggests that this move reflects Google’s further interest in turning its huge image search database into a source of revenue. Perhaps giving us a little bit more insight into what this acquisition will mean for Google’s Image Search, a designer at the startup by the name of Stefanie Kraus described the tool on her website: The purchase research tool offers education around the product space and allows customers to customize their shortlist based on individual needs and preferences. By introducing a filtering system that takes “nice to have” and “ideal” into consideration, we make sure that the products are presented in a meaningful way. Stefanie was listed as principal UX designer for the startup on her LinkedIn profile until October.

(Photo: Justin Sullivan, Getty Images) 313 CONNECTTWEET 9 LINKEDIN 27 COMMENTEMAILMORE SAN FRANCISCO — Facebook isn't the only source of fake news on the Web. Alphabet's Google was dragged into the muck Monday, when its search engine prominently displayed an obscure right-wing blog, 70news.wordpress.com, that falsely claimed President-elect Donald Trump won the popular vote in last week's election.  (Hillary Clinton leads Trump by nearly 700,000 votes, but Trump won in the Electoral College, according to the Associated Press.) "The goal of Search is to provide the most relevant and useful results for our users. In this case we clearly didn’t get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms," Google spokeswoman Maggie Shiels said in a email statement. The results popped up under a Google search banner called  "In the News" when a user searched for "who won the popular vote." As of Monday evening, the blog's post was still there, though it followed stories that referenced the erroneous results. In the News is different from Google News (news.google.com.) The blog's publisher said it had based its information on "twitter posts" over the weekend, specifically one from user @koxingA8. The dust-up, on the heels of criticism that Facebook was a breeding ground for misinformation during the run-up to the presidential election, is more fodder for a national debate on the responsibility of social media and other types of technology that broadly disseminate information to billions of people worldwide. Most news carried on Google's search engine comes from established media sources such as the New York Times and CNN, according to data analysis from journalists at the University of Maryland. Later Monday, Google said it would remove sites it had found to be providing fake news from its advertising program. The erroneous blog post is sure to give technology another black eye in what has been mounting criticism about its propensity to amplify misleading information across broad digital platforms. Facebook has been assailed for prominently featuring fake news on its site, prompting CEO Mark Zuckerberg to deny it unwittingly helped Trump become president-elect. He said 99% of news on the social network is "authentic," and has vowed to weed out fake news. Late Monday, the company said it would pull ads from fake news sites. USA TODAY Facebook employees form fake news task force “In accordance with the Audience Network Policy, we do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news," Facebook said in a statement. "While implied, we have updated the policy to explicitly clarify that this applies to fake news. Our team will continue to closely vet all prospective publishers and monitor existing ones to ensure compliance." USA TODAY Zuckerberg vows to weed out Facebook 'fake news' A group of Facebook employees, meanwhile, have formed an unofficial task force to refute Zuckerberg's claim that the company bears no responsibility for the spread of fake news, according to a BuzzFeed News report.

(AP Photo/Virginia Mayo, File) SAN FRANCISCO—Google’s search engine highlighted an inaccurate story claiming that President-elect Donald Trump won the popular vote in last week’s election, the latest example of bogus information spread by the internet’s gatekeepers. The incorrect results were shown Monday in a two-day-old story posted on the pro-Trump “70 News” site. A link to the site appeared at or near the top of Google’s influential rankings of relevant news stories for searches on the final election results. Google acknowledged the problem, although as of mid-afternoon Monday, the link to “70 News” remained prominent in its results. FAKE NEWS ON STEROIDS False information is nothing new on the internet, where debunkers have been batting down unfounded claims and urban legends for more than two decades. But the problem has gained more attention in the post-mortem of a bitterly contested presidential election in which Trump, a Republican billionaire and former reality TV star, defeated Hillary Clinton, a Democrat and former U.S. secretary of state who had been leading in the polls. Trump wound up prevailing in enough key states to win the Electoral College’s decisive vote, but is trailing Clinton in the overall popular vote with some ballots still being counted. Clinton’s lead in the popular vote has become one of the flashpoints in the protests against Trump’s election being staged in cities across the country. Google is just the latest company in the crosshairs. Fake news stories uncritically circulated during and after the election on Facebook have sparked a debate over the role of social media companies, which are key sources of news for large numbers of people. Critics suggest that these companies should be more careful to ensure they aren’t passing along misleading information. SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE NEWS Google’s dominant search engine is the leading source of traffic to media sites, according to the online analytics firm Chartbeat. Meanwhile, a study by the Pew Research Center found about 60 percent of Americans get at least some of their news from social media sites such as Facebook, which now has 178 million users in the U.S. and Canada. In the election’s aftermath, Facebook has been accused of possibly swaying the election’s outcome by promoting fake news stories on its social network. Last summer, the company fired a handful of journalists who oversaw its “trending” news list and replaced them with an algorithm; fake news stories quickly began to trend. CEO Mark Zuckerberg brushed off that criticism as “crazy ” in an appearance last week. He elaborated in a Saturday post on Facebook in which he asserted that “more than 99 percent of what people see” on Facebook is authentic. Zuckerberg conceded more needs to be done to block bogus information, but said that determining what’s blatantly wrong isn’t always an easy task. “Identifying the ‘truth’ is complicated,” Zuckerberg wrote. “While some hoaxes can be completely debunked, a greater amount of content, including from mainstream sources, often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted.” The stories featured in the feeds of Facebook users are primarily selected by automated formulas known as algorithms. Google’s search results are also powered by algorithms that the company regularly revises to thwart sites that attempt to artificially boost their prominence. MORE, BETTER ALGORITHMS? Google conceded its search engine misfired with the 70 News story that falsely declared Trump the popular vote winner in both its headline and the body of the text. “In this case we clearly didn’t get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms,” the company said in a statement. Bad information in an online headline or at the top of a story can be particularly damaging. Roughly 53 percent of the people who land on a web page stay for 15 seconds or less, according to Chartbeat’s findings. Incorrect information is bound to ripple across the internet as more people rely on their phones, computers and other digital devices to read news that is picked out for them by automated programs, said media analyst Ken Doctor of Newsonomics. “What we are seeing is the failure of the algorithm,” Doctor said. “These algorithms bring a lot of things into our lives that humans cannot do. But when algorithms fail, it highlights the fact that they are not just some kind of neutral technology. They are programmed by human beings and they have all the failings of human beings.” It’s difficult to know what happened when an algorithm goes awry because Google, Facebook and other internet companies closely guard how they work, much the way Coca-Cola protects the recipe for its soda. But the growing power that Google and Facebook hold over the flow of information could increase the political pressure for them to be held more accountable, Doctor said. In the meantime, most people remain skeptical about what they read online. Only 4 percent of Americans have a lot of confidence in what they read on social media sites, according to Pew. Local news organizations fared better in Pew Research’s survey earlier this year, with 22 percent of Americans saying they trusted the information there.

The social network has updated its advertising policies to spell out that its ban on deceptive and misleading content now also applies to fake news. The shift in policy comes as Google, Facebook and Twitter all faced a backlash over the role they played in the U.S. presidential election.  Facebook has announced a crackdown on the spread of 'fake news' sits by trying to limit the amount phony sites can make in advertising. The sites were accused of spreading false and often malicious information that might have swayed voters towards Republican candidate Donald Trump. And the debate became so fierce, that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg was forced to insist twice in recent days that his social network had no role in influencing the election. But announcing new measures today, a statement on Facebook said: 'We do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news', adding that it will continue to vet publishers to ensure compliance.

Share this article Share However, Facebook's steps are limited to its ad policies, and do not target fake news sites shared by users on their news feeds. Meanwhile, search engine Google has also said it is working on a policy change to prevent websites that misrepresent content from using its AdSense advertising network. Google's move similarly does not address the issue of fake news or hoaxes appearing in Google search results. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, pictured,  was forced to insist twice in recent days that his social network had no role in influencing the election Nor does Google suggest that the company has moved to a mechanism for rating the accuracy of particular articles. Rather, the change is aimed at assuring that publishers on the network are legitimate and eliminating financial incentives that appear to have driven the production of much fake news. The company said in a statement: 'Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property.' The company did not detail how it would implement or enforce the new policy. AdSense, which allows advertisers to place text ads on the millions of websites that are part of Google's network, is a major source of money for many publishers. A report in BuzzFeed News last month showed how tiny publishers in Macedonia were creating websites with fake news - much of it denigrating Clinton - which were widely shared on Facebook. That sharing in turn led people to click on links which brought them to the Macedonian websites, which could then make money on the traffic via Google's AdSense. Facebook has been widely blamed for allowing the spread of online misinformation, most of it pro-Trump, but Zuckerberg has rejected the notion that Facebook influenced the outcome of the election or that fake news is a major problem on the service.  Search engine Google has also said it is working on a policy change to prevent websites that misrepresent content from using its AdSense advertising network In a blog post on Saturday, he wrote: 'Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99 percent of what people see is authentic. Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes.' Meanwhile, Fil Menczer, a professor of informatics and computing at Indiana University who has studied the spread of misinformation on social media, said Google's move with AdSense was a positive step. He said: 'One of the incentives for a good portion of fake news is money. This could cut the income that creates the incentive to create the fake news sites.' However, he cautioned that detecting fake news sites was not easy. He added: 'What if it is a site with some real information and some fake news? It requires specialized knowledge and having humans (do it) doesn't scale.'  Share or comment on this article e-mail 63 shares Most watched News videos Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Man discovers wife is cheating on him following her with drone Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Obama on Trump: This office has a way of waking you up SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Emotional Chelsea Handler fights back tears over election results 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing Obama's dig at Clinton over her ground game failures Pres.

President Young Sohn said when talking about the South Korean company’s $8 billion deal to buy Harman International Industries Inc. is that the electronics giant has no intention of building a car. The emphasis was intentional. Samsung’s target customers are carmakers who’d love to give their vehicles smartphone-like capabilities but are leery of surrendering unfettered access to their dashboards. They’ve largely kept a distance from Google, which could mine driver data for its own uses, or Apple Inc., which until recently had designs on building its own car. Samsung wants to marry its consumer electronics expertise and the fast 5G cellular network it’s developing with Harman’s presence in dashboards all over the world. If it works, they can offer carmakers a lightning-quick connected system for infotainment, mapping, concierge services and autonomous driving -- and all without the worry that the automakers would be helping a future competitor. “This is not about building a car,” Young said in an interview. Several automakers “came to us and asked us to help with technologies like 5G, or artificial intelligence or memory. We can harness technologies to provide a better experience to automakers.” Samsung offered $112 a share in cash for Harman, which was 28 percent above the Stamford, Connecticut-based company’s closing price of $87.65 in New York on Friday. The stock closed up 22 percent to $109.72, the biggest gain since its 1986 initial public offering. Samsung’s own shares rose on the deal, which was announced after the market closed Monday. The stock climbed as much as 1.8 percent as of 9:45 a.m. in Seoul. The acquisition reverberated through the car business, with Wells Fargo analyst David Lim saying in a research note that the deal could “ignite additional mergers and acquisitions of higher technology auto suppliers.” The shares of automotive electronics maker Visteon Corp. jumped 9.6 percent -- the most since August 2012 -- and larger rival Delphi Automotive Plc gained 2.2 percent. Deals like Samsung’s for Harman could be welcome by automakers, who want to control the revenue from connected car services and the customer data it generates as much as possible, said Jim Hines, a research director at Gartner. ‘Competitive Dynamic’ “There is definitely a competitive dynamic that has emerged between the established automotive industry and these large tech companies that are looking to get a piece of that market opportunity,” Hines said. As automakers have rolled out connected services in their cars, they have been very careful in how they work with Google and Apple. General Motors Co. allows its customers to connect their smartphones into the dashboard through Apple’s Car Play and Google’s Android Auto -- but only with selected apps, and the phones cannot access a car’s data. Toyota Motor Corp. doesn’t allow its cars to connect to either system. The fear among carmakers is that Apple and Google could either mine the data inside the car, tracking everything from driving patterns to engine performance, to either become a new face to the consumer or to help them build cars. The fact that Harman is already a supplier and that Samsung doesn’t have a system that competes with the in-car connected services sold by carmakers could make them a more attractive partner, Hines said. Partner or Threat? “They might be viewed as less of a threat in terms of tech partner for some of these leading automotive brands," Hines said. Samsung wants to become a high-tech supplier capable of building connected systems. Its expertise is making the hardware, like microprocessing units, and a faster 5G network to deliver more data to cars faster. Harman sells -- among other technologies -- 3D navigation, apps for integrating other devices into the car, active safety systems and audio systems that can access the cloud. There are a lot of opportunities once the companies combine, Harman Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dinesh Paliwal said in a phone interview. Imagine a car that that can read a driver’s daily schedule and automatically dial into a conference call, Paliwal said. Autonomous driving will only give drivers access to more connected capabilities for work or entertainment, he said. "We’ll be in the best possible position because we have all the capabilities," Paliwal said. Overcoming Weaknesses Exclusive insights in your inbox, from our technology reporters around the world.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter Assuming the merger goes through, Samsung will need to develop other capabilities, especially in software, said Cyrus Mewawalla, lead analyst at CM Research. Like Google and Apple, Samsung wants to own and provide the servers, the hardware that’s doing all the computing and the memory storage for connected cars. They also want to own the platform that runs the apps, in the way that Apple’s iOS and Android do now. While they have expertise in some things like microprocessors, they don’t have all of those capabilities, Mewawalla said. “They’d need more than just this acquisition,” he said. “The two key weaknesses Samsung has is the software ecosystem and cloud infrastructure, and that’s where it needs to be acquiring." Artificial intelligence, in which Samsung has recently made a deal, should be a particular area of focus in the near future, he added. If it chooses, the company could also have the resources to develop such capabilities on its own once Harman’s 8,000 software engineers and join Samsung, which spends $13 billion a year on research and development and $23 billion in capital expenditures. “Imagine the scale of our R&D," Paliwal said.

The latest: Google’s search engine came under fire Monday for highlighting an inaccurate story from the pro-Donald Trump site 70news claiming that he won the popular vote in last week’s election; a link to the site appeared at or near the top of Google’s influential rankings of relevant news stories for searches on the final election results. Meanwhile, Facebook has been under fire for how false news stories that it helped to spread could have influenced the election. Does charity begin at Apple? Apple is making it easier for people to give to charities by expanding its Apple Pay payments service to nonprofits, including the American Red Cross and the United Way. Apple Pay can speed transactions because people don’t have to re-enter card and contact information, though people need to enable the service first. PayPal paying piper for picking pols Politics may make strange bedfellows, but it also leads to a lot of get-out-of-my-bed, fellas. Take San Jose’s PayPal, which got flack and threats of boycotts from conservatives in April — even getting a story on Breitbart — because it veered away from expanding to North Carolina because of a state law that targeted gays. Now it is one of 12 companies being boycotted by a new group called the DJT Resistance because co-founder Peter Thiel (who left the company when eBay bought it in 2002) and big investor Carl Icahn backed Donald Trump.

Google doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with the working abilities of the launcher beyond Pixel and Pixel XL – but it is what it is. At the same time, Microsoft has updated its own Arrow Launcher to take on what Google has with their Pixel phones. We previously went over a small number of phones Pixel launcher works on. Now, in addition to the Pixel and Pixel XL and CyanogenMod 14, we’ve confirmed that some phones with CyanogenMod 13 work, too. Our original report has been updated, and users of most phones from the past two years (new phones) should be able to use the launcher. They should, that is, just so long as they’re using CyanogenMod 13 or 14 when they make the attempt. For those users that cannot access the app through Google Play, there’s an APK Mirror listing. The most recent update to the app via APK Mirror is Pixel Launcher 7.1.1-3359438 from October 19th, 2016 as of press time for this article. This is the same version we’ve tested with both most recent versions of CyanogenMod. Microsoft’s update to Arrow Launcher comes just as the Google Pixel and Pixel XL hit stores – and the latter device is re-stocked online. This update to Arrow Launcher adds memory efficiency, bug fixes, and the return of the widgets pack from a previous iteration of the app. This version also adds icon size customization – though we stress that modifying the size of Android icons may very well make pages look quite crazy. Microsoft added several features that were likely inspired by the Pixel launcher from Google. The most prevalent of these features is the ability to add shortcuts to app icons. Users could also potentially have all of Google’s newest icons by downloading the Pixel icon pack from Google Play by Saurabh Gupta. Microsoft’s Arrow Launcher is also available through Google Play and is, as always, delivered without cost. This app was updated on the 8th of November, 2016 to version number 2.6.0.27593. Users will find that they’ll need Android version 4.0.3 and up if they want to make use of the app. Story Timeline ADW Launcher 2.0 official: time for Android fun New Nexus phones might also have a new app launcher Google Nexus launcher apk download released for Android Android Nougat MR1 to bring Google Assistant, new Launcher Nexus Launcher becomes Pixel Launcher, confirms brand change Nova Launcher update gifts Nougat to old Androids Tags AndroidgoogleGoogle PixellauncherpixelPixel XLsmartphone Must Read Bits & Bytes 2017 Honda Civic Hatchback First Drive Jaguar I-PACE Concept previews Model X rivaling EV for 2018 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar Review (late-2016) Surface Book with Performance Base Review 7 ways I’ll escape or mobilize today with technology Latest Headlines Xiaomi Mi Mix bend test shocks with heartiness Nov 15, 2016 Nintendo Switch reportedly shuffles major launch titles Nov 15, 2016 Super Mario Run release date and pricing revealed Nov 15, 2016 eBay mobile app updated in time for holiday shopping Nov 15, 2016 NHTSA “Quiet Car” safety standard will make hybrids and EVs noisy Nov 15, 2016 Latest Reviews MacBook Pro with Touch Bar Review (late-2016) Nov 14, 2016 Surface Book with Performance Base Review Nov 10, 2016 Google Daydream View Review Nov 10, 2016 LG V20 Review: Stealing the Note 7’s spotlight Nov 4, 2016 Living with Google Home Nov 3, 2016 Search © 2005-2016 SlashGear, All Rights Reserved.

Public Address, a community of blogs Hard News by Russell Brown 10:53 Nov 15, 2016 59 The fake news problem The Washington Post, Buzzfeed and others are reporting something strange and troubling today: a fake news site falsely claiming that Donald Trump and not Hillary Clinton has won the popular vote in last week's US Presidential election is the top search result in Google News. The result of the popular vote is, I'm sure you know, immaterial to the result of the Presidential election – but it carries a undeniable moral weight. Equally obviously, the claim is simply untrue. Clinton will ultimately win between one and two million more votes than Trump. I don't know enough about the way the Google News algorithm works to say exactly what's gone in here, but I can guess and say that the currency of the story – the number of times it's been cited and linked to – pushed it to the top of the news search results. This isn't immutable. The Post's screenshot of the result looked like this: By the time Buzzfeed screenshotted its search result, the Post's story had hove into view, for presumably the same reasons the fake story was elevated. Another report by Business Insider found other debunking stories beginning to populate the results: So debunking fake news is worth doing. But I tried the same search just now – and the fake story is still the lead result. Google isn't doing this deliberately. It's not a corporate plot. Remember, Eric Schmidt, the executive chair of Google's parent company Alphabet Inc, was an informal advisor and donor to Barack Obama. He's also an investor in The Groundwork, a data company used by the Clinton campaign. So what the hell is 70News and how is this happening? The Post's story notes that the report on the Wordpress-hosted 70News is based on a tweet, which in turn cites USASupreme.com – a site which occasioned the memorable Wonkette headline Hillary Clinton Threatened To Murder Bernie Sanders, Says Credible Not-Russian-Sounding News Site back in August. The Wonkette story is worth reading for its forensics on how that particular fake news story was put together. A couple more things about USASupreme: whoever writes it appears not to have English as a first language – and they freakin' love Wikileaks and Julian Assange. That story concludes: So once again Assange the man who exposed the truth about Hillary Clinton to the world has confirmed that Trump is clean and it is the democrats that made so many bad decision over the last couple of years. USASupreme also really likes – and I'm guessing this isn't going to come as a total surprise to you – Vladimir Putin: The belief that Hillary Clinton, if elected, was going to precipitate World War III was remarkably popular in the weeks and months before the election, especially amongst professed left-wingers. Does USASupreme spring from the bowels of the now infamous building in St Petersburg where a "troll army" labours to influence the beliefs of Russian and other citizens? We can't tell. But this story on what happened when Swedes debated whether to join NATO – a flood of confusing information and outright falsehoods into the public discourse – is interesting. And sobering: The claims were alarming: If Sweden, a non-NATO member, signed the deal, the alliance would stockpile secret nuclear weapons on Swedish soil; NATO could attack Russia from Sweden without government approval; NATO soldiers, immune from prosecution, could rape Swedish women without fear of criminal charges. They were all false, but the disinformation had begun spilling into the traditional news media, and as the defense minister, Peter Hultqvist, traveled the country to promote the pact in speeches and town hall meetings, he was repeatedly grilled about the bogus stories. “People were not used to it, and they got scared, asking what can be believed, what should be believed?” said Marinette Nyh Radebo, Mr. Hultqvist’s spokeswoman. Further down: “The dynamic is always the same: It originates somewhere in Russia, on Russia state media sites, or different websites or somewhere in that kind of context,” said Anders Lindberg, a Swedish journalist and lawyer. “Then the fake document becomes the source of a news story distributed on far-left or far-right-wing websites,” he said. “Those who rely on those sites for news link to the story, and it spreads. Nobody can say where they come from, but they end up as key issues in a security policy decision.” Although the topics may vary, the goal is the same, Mr. Lindberg and others suggested. “What the Russians are doing is building narratives; they are not building facts,” he said. “The underlying narrative is, ‘Don’t trust anyone.’” And: “The Russians are very good at courting everyone who has a grudge with liberal democracy, and that goes from extreme right to extreme left,” said Patrik Oksanen, an editorial writer for the Swedish newspaper group MittMedia. The central idea, he said, is that “liberal democracy is corrupt, inefficient, chaotic and, ultimately, not democratic.” Another message, largely unstated, is that European governments lack the competence to deal with the crises they face, particularly immigration and terrorism, and that their officials are all American puppets. Sound familiar? Every time during this US election campaign that I got involved in a social media argument with someone telling me things about Ukraine or Syria – which was far too many times – I'd find myself explaining that I actually follow a few people who cover those conflicts closely, and none of them say that's what's happening. Sadly, I was often referred to screeds by John Pilger that didn't tally with any reliable reporting either. Meanwhile, the Wikileaks Twitter account gushed with misleading, out-of-context or outright false characterisations of material from its email troves. The Infosec Taylor Swift account has been on a tear about this over the past couple of days: "WikiLeaks spreads information."

I don't think Mark Zuckerberg likes fake news any more than you and I do – it's just that the business model has evolved around it. The cancer has incorporated itself into the body. This is not to say that Clinton, the USA and liberal democracy itself are blameless innocents in the world. But something pretty nasty is happening here. And by the way, a white supremacist publisher of fake news is going to be chief strategist in the Trump White House. But I will tell you one thing: think twice before you complain about the "mainstream media". News organisations aren't perfect, but they've been basically your only bulwark against all this. Indeed, one of the few pleasures of the ghastly Presidential campaign was discovering the work of a host of good journalists – from David Farenthold at the Post to feisty independents like Sarah Kendzior. It's not just the Post and the Times, it's  Buzzfeed and Snopes and a hundred others. It's all those people literally put in a pen at Trump rallies. It's going to be a tough few years for some of them. A couple of days ago, Silicon Valley investor and "contrarian" Keith Rabois posted a string of tweets along these lines. Wait until journalists learn that today's AI is close to writing news stories on par or better than they do. — Keith Rabois (@rabois) November 12, 2016 He seemed to enjoy the idea. We should run screaming from it. As Facebook moved from human curation to trust arficial intelligence to sift it stories, fakery exploded. It was a Google algorithm, not an editor, that made a wholly false claim about the popular vote the "top" story in its rankings. The idea that AI will actually write most of the news we see is genuinely horrifying. Be nice to the next journalist you see.

I have been noticing 'robot news' for a while now, and its willing human servitors (by that you can practically add every media outlet in the world now too, with their stories by click-bait for click-bait). Over the last year, I have found myself checking stories that appear apparently genuine but when double-checked, even just clicking on other things on the alleged sites, one finds something seriously wrong... Indeed, it is getting to the stage you could almost premise a new paid media outlet on the fact that it hosts no fake news or click-bait... I'm also disturbed by the complete insulation those pesky little algorithms give is where literally we can see nothing other than what we might agree with or like - I've been a TV researcher for an occupation and I need to find diversity of views. I'd hate to think what the Google algorithms make of my search history but in the short term it is only too obvious... You can nearly see how your searches change the results and the associated ads immediately... It is one reason I still like hard-copy magazines and newspapers. One gets a comparatively unmediated chunk of the world, as opposed to just the stuff you can be bothered clicking. An eye across a page is a swifter means of information-gathering than any number of clicks. But, yes, despairingly, the little bubbles we live in... and it was only too clear watching American voters in the recent election.

Yes, Russia deploys propaganda, and yes, there is admiration on the right for the tough-guy/thug images of both Trump and Putin. But many establishment writers (IE, working for largish organisations) in the US went insane hyping up the story. Here is Kurt Eichenwald writing for Newsweek: Western intelligence and law enforcement say tens of thousands of people have been working with Russia on its hacking and disinformation campaign for many years. They include propagandists and cyberoperatives stationed in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Novosibirsk, located in the southwestern part of Siberia. Operations have also been conducted in the United States, primarily out of New York City, Washington, D.C., and Miami. Those involved include a large number of Russian émigrés, as well as Americans and other foreign nationals. Intelligence operations in Europe and the U.S. have determined that the money these émigrés receive for their work is disguised as payments from a Russian pension system. One U.S. official says there is evidence many of these Americans and foreign nationals do not know they are part of Russia’s propaganda operation. Emphasis mine. This is race baiting bullshit. Trump talks about Muslims and 'Islamic Extremism' in much the same way.

It has been hard watching people on the NZ left re-tweet writers who are egging on war with Syria. This is just a meaningless statement. No one is “egging on war with Syria”. As recently as September, the US reached agreement with Assad and the Russians to focus on Isis and al-Nusrah. Syria agreed to cease bombing defined civilian areas. It fell apart when Assad and Russia rained hell down on Aleppo. See Amnesty International: Syrian and Russian forces targeting hospitals as a strategy of war and this, also from Amnesty: The Syrian government, with Russia’s support, has without a doubt used air power to deliberately inflict suffering on civilians, routinely bombing densely populated civilian areas and buildings. For several years, there’s been a clear pattern of government bombardment as a means of punishing populations in areas controlled by the armed opposition. But there is more to it than that. Over the past year, Amnesty International has documented a pattern of deliberate attacks on hospitals in the north of Aleppo governorate in what appears to be part of a military strategy to empty towns and villages of residents, in order to pave the way for ground forces to advance. It is this same strategy that Syrian government forces are now using to gain control of Aleppo city. The city’s besiegement – coupled with the impotence of the UN Security Council and others – has empowered Russia and the Syrian government to attack civilians with impunity and leave only one option for Aleppo residents to escape the horror – forcing them to evacuate to government-controlled areas. Once the city is emptied of people, the government can seize control and claim victory. It did this last month too in Daraya, near Damascus, which the remaining inhabitants reluctantly agreed to completely evacuate after four years of brutal siege and bombardment. One of the most despicable things that people kept linking me to was the Pilger screed in which he twisted all kinds of facts to depict the FSA as no different to Isis and basically characterised the bombing of Aleppo as taking out the trash. Fuck him and every other apologist for what’s happening. Fuck them and their undying love affair with former Communist strongmen. It isn’t just loons who see a no fly zone as the beginning of a war against Russia. I didn’t see how Clinton’s idea would work. But that’s not the same as “starting World War III’. And saying so is just reciting words.

(Shelby Lum/Richmond Times-Dispatch via AP) Donald Trump unquestionably won the 2016 presidential election, but he is trailing in the popular vote. That might come as a surprise to people who Googled the phrase "Final Election Count" as late as 2 p.m. on Nov. 14. The first entry in Google’s news category -- above those from news links to the Washington Post and Politico -- was a Nov. 12 post (updated the following day) from a little-known site called 70news. "Final election 2016 numbers: Trump won both popular (62.9M-62.2M) and Electoral College Votes (306-232)," the post’s headline said. Further down the page, the site’s anonymous author wrote, "To all the liberal loonies still rioting because you claim Trump did not get the popular vote, get your meds now and prepare to be shocked because the finals results are in. Trump got 306 Electoral College vote while Hillary Clinton got 232. For #PopularVote: #Trump: 62,972,226 #Clinton: 62,277,750." According to its Facebook page, the site launched in August and seeks to "share news that matters to you. What liberal media will try to hide, we will uncover." Here’s a screenshot of how that particular Google search displayed the 70news post -- prominently. But while it’s absolutely true that Trump won the Electoral College vote -- which is the only thing that matters in determining who moves into the White House on Jan. 20 -- he is not leading in the popular vote. The most comprehensive vote-tracking analysis is published by David Wasserman of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. As of 2:30 p.m. on Nov. 14, according to Wasserman’s calculations, Clinton led Trump by 784,748 votes -- specifically, 61,422,098 for Clinton, 60,637,350 for Trump, and 6,691,311 for other candidates. Other tallies showed similar results. CNN at that time showed a Clinton-over-Trump margin of 668,059, while the Associated Press had a margin of 668,483. (Different media outlets may report different numbers at a given time because of delays in obtaining and uploading new data.) Here’s CNN’s tally by mid-day Nov. 14, showing Clinton ahead by half a percentage point. And given the votes left to be counted, it’s almost impossible to imagine that Trump will gain back ground in the coming days. That’s because California -- a state where Clinton is beating Trump by a 62 percent-33 percent margin -- has the most votes still to count of any state. Nearly a week after the election, CNN estimates that only 70 percent of the California vote had been counted. In addition, only 87 percent of the vote in Oregon had been counted; Clinton beat Trump 52 percent-41 percent there. And Washington state had counted only 87 percent of its vote; Clinton beat Trump there by a 55 percent-38 percent margin. So it’s entirely plausible that Clinton could end up winning the popular vote by 1 million to 1.5 million votes -- roughly two or three times the popular-vote margin assembled by Al Gore when he lost the Electoral College, and the presidency, to George W. Bush in 2000. By Nov. 14, the Washington Post and Business Insider both posted articles questioning why Google still had the 70news article at the top of their news category. A Google representative said the company was looking into the issue. And on Nov. 14, 70news posted an update: "Anyone asking where I got the figures, it was from twitter posts. … If I’m wrong, I won’t hesitate to change the numbers. It’s the job of the establishment media to tell the people the final numbers when it’s out there already." (The Twitter post cited by 70News was this one.) But as of 3 p.m. on Nov. 14, 70news still had the article up. Our ruling Social media was abuzz with the claim that the "final election 2016 numbers" showed that Trump had won won both the popular and Electoral College contests. Trump certainly won the Electoral College vote, and as a result, he will become president. But he clearly trails in the popular vote. As of this writing, Clinton is ahead by nearly 800,000 votes, a margin that is likely to expand further as late returns trickle in from California, Oregon and Washington state, all of which are strong Clinton states. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

Early on Monday, internet users were surprised to discover that while trying to find the latest on the US elections (they are still counting ballots), the top Google news story claimed that Donald Trump had won both the electoral college and the popular vote. This is, of course, not true and the story in question comes from one of an ever-expanding number of news sites that use the same style as real news reports, but repeat or invent wildly inaccurate and misleading information, typically with a strong political bias. The fact that Google not only linked to the story but also, for a while, had it listed as the top result, has added to an increasing sense of unease over the impact of fake news on people's lives, and their decisions. On Saturday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was forced to defend his company against accusations that the social media giant had unwittingly swayed the tight election race in Donald Trump and the Republican Party's favor, thanks to the prevalence of fake news stories on its service. "After the election, many people are asking whether fake news contributed to the result, and what our responsibility is to prevent fake news from spreading," Zuckerberg wrote online. "Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99 per cent of what people see is authentic. Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes. The hoaxes that do exist are not limited to one partisan view, or even to politics. Overall, this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other." Lies, damn lies and statistics Of course, Zuckerberg did not break down what "content" means and some have been quick to point out that if you pull out material that was not related to the election (the bulk of it), then that percentage would rocket. Or, in other words, there is a serious problem with people picking up fake news on Facebook. Facebook's increasing importance as a source of information for people has caused previous blow-ups: from a backlash that resulted in the company inviting conservative voices to its headquarters to discuss how it would remain unbiased in news coverage; to the hiring and then firing of journalists to filter content. Originally, Facebook intended to use human editors to clear out click-bait stories that frustrated users, but during the election season the same holes were increasingly used to inject fake political stories into the social media service – stories that were then repeated and amplified across other online services. In this most recent example, flagged by Google, the website references other also-fake sources of information, which themselves reference other fake news sources, creating an entire string of misinformation. Social scientists and psychologists have long concluded that if people hear the same information from multiple sources – typically between three and five – they become convinced of its truth. As for Google, it used to require smaller news websites to fill out an online application to be considered as a news source, with each application reviewed by a human. That process changed a few years ago, however, when the search giant tweaked its news algorithm and now a much larger range of sources appear on its news page. Google did not respond to requests for how the fake news site managed to get so high in its rankings – and it wasn't just for a single specific search but multiple different variations of searches for election results – and it has yet to comment on the controversy more generally. However, this being the self-regarding internet, currently the biggest news stories for "final election results" on Google are stories about Google ranking a fake news story. ® Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 28 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

National World Business Tech Sport Entertainment Life & Style Travel Motoring Profile Settings Sign Out technology Search Digital Living Gadgets Games Social Networking Apps Review: Google's VR headset EDWARD C. BAIG Last updated 11:00, November 15 2016 Reuters Daydream is a step up in price and class compared to the Google Cardboard virtual reality viewers that Google and its partners make available. Here's the chief reality behind Google's virtual reality headset: it all boils down to content. In the week that I've had to test Daydream View, I not only craved more VR content, but wished more of the Daydream experiences I tried blew me away. Only a select few apps were made available by Google for this review. Still, the beauty and promise of all virtual reality is that it places you somewhere that would be difficult if not near impossible for most of us to experience day-to-day. And as a mobile VR solution along the lines of Samsung's Gear VR, Daydream does give you a hint of that promise. Google's headset was unveiled in September and went on sale in Australia and the US last week. You can't buy it in New Zealand yet. I particularly enjoyed poking around YouTube VR. In one video I landed in the Artic, within virtual spitting distance of a polar bear and cub. In another, I got to see what it was like in the depths of the Isle of Jaws, a hotbed for great white sharks. It was also fun watching movie trailers on the virtual gigantic screen theatre inside Google Play, though I'm not convinced I'd commit hours of wearing Daydream on my head to take in an entire film. But I'm getting ahead of myself. WHAT YOU NEED For now, you'll need to buy one of the two recently launched Google smartphones, the Pixel or the Pixel XL, to experience Daydream, since these are the only compatible phones on the market. Reuters Google Daydream only works with the company's Pixel phones. More capable Android handsets are on the way, and so are more capable Daydream-ready apps. Google expects Daydream phones to arrive in the coming months from Samsung, HTC, ZTE, Xiaomi, Alcatel, Asus, LG, Motorola, and HTC. Huawei's recently announced new Mate 9 Pro is also going to work with Daydream. In the slowly evolving consumer ecosystem for virtual reality, you can lump Daydream in with the Oculus-powered Samsung Gear VR. Gear VR also only works with a limited set of smartphones, for now all models from Samsung. Daydream is a step up in price and class compared to the Google Cardboard virtual reality viewers that Google and its partners make available. And like Gear VR, it is way cheaper and accessible, albeit less compelling, than the pricey Oculus Rift or HTV Vive machines that need to be tethered to powerful computers, or the PlayStation VR system that Sony sells, which connects to PlayStation game consoles. DAYDREAM VERSUS GEAR VR Daydream is made of a light breathable fabric and it is more compact and comfortable to wear than the hard plastic Gear VR, which at times felt heavy on the bridge of my nose. Both headsets can be worn over eyeglasses. You start out by placing the Pixel on a tray and closing a latch that is secured by pulling an elastic loop over a nub. The outer edge of your phone remains exposed so that you can plug in headphones. Ad Feedback As you pull the Daydream over your head, you'll want to ensure a tight fit by adjusting a strap. I found that the headset sometime slid down slightly on the front of my face. That's important not only for comfort but for a proper focus. There's no focus wheel like there is on Gear VR, which means that how sharp the images appear to you inside Daydream directly correlates to how the thing lays on your face. Another big difference between Daydream and Gear VR is that Google's set comes with a separate wireless oblong controller, which has a clickable touchpad and a few buttons for controlling apps, volume and the action in whatever VR experience you're involved in. On Gear VR, there's a built-in touchpad along the right temple, so this is a big advantage for Google. Samsung has more apps at the moment. I like having the separate controller but sometime had to fuss with the controls to make the cursor appear inside an app or the Daydream Home forest environment, which is the starting place for finding content and accessing the Play Store. You can stow the controller inside Daydream when you're not using the headset; its kept in place by an elastic band, minimising the chance that you'll misplace it. The Daydream controller has a USB-C charging port that is compatible with the cable that comes with the Pixel. According to the Google the controller, battery will last about 12 hours or more than a day in standby mode. Most concerning, however, is the fact that the battery inside the Pixel phone appears to be draining pretty quickly when you're using Daydream, and the Pixel itself runs exceedingly hot. I'm not suggesting you're facing the kind of risk that required Samsung to recall its Note 7 device (which was one of the phones that worked with Gear VR), just that this is something you really notice. BRING ON THE CONTENT In the end, of course, Daydream will live or die by the content you get to watch. Among the experiences I got to try and enjoy was an outerspace simulation called Star Chart VR, which let me travel from Earth to Mars to Saturn. Inside a Google Arts & Culture app, I viewed audio-guided masterpieces by van Gogh and other artists. And back inside YouTube, I especially enjoyed watching and listening (via spatial 3D audio) the Does Not Exist VR beatboxing video from Reeps One. I also played a game called Mekorama in which you try to help a small robot navigate puzzling mechanical dioramas. In another, called Wonderglade, which seems more suited for young kids, I played carnival games in a theme park. Still, I wanted more. Google lists numerous apps it says will reach Daydream before the end of the year. Many are from such media properties as BBC, CNN and the New York Times. A number of entertainment-oriented apps are also on the list, including HBO Go, Hulu VR, Jaunt, the NBA, NextVR and Netflix. And more games are coming too, ranging from Need for Speed: No Limits VR from EA to Home Run Derby by Major League Baseball. Bringing them on will make virtual reality that much more real and engaging.  - MCT Saved|Saved Stories Saved|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Next Gadgets story: There's a tech battle brewing over whiteboards that cost thousands of dollars Technology Homepage Comments technology headlines Twitter to thwart cyber-bullying Live: 7.5 New Zealand quake Sleeping woman burnt by iPhone PS4 Pro: Hands on review An optimist on the future of energy Consumer drone market slumps Review: Watch Dogs 2 Where did you go Kendall?

Image Credit: Getty Images "Final Election Count" Google results promote a dangerous right-wing hoax with false info By Melanie Ehrenkranz November 14, 2016 SHARE TWEET PIN Donald Trump was elected president of the United States, but Hillary Clinton won the popular vote — and her lead is growing. So why does the leading Google search result indicate that Trump won the popular vote? And why is the top story from such a sketchy source? Google search results for "final election count" bring up false information. Source: Mic/Google When you Google search "final election count," the top search result is a factually incorrect story that suggests that Trump won both the popular and Electoral College votes. He didn't.  The story is from 70News, a far-, far-right-leaning Wordpress blog. 70News' headlines include things like "THE STEVE BANNON HYSTERIA: IF TRUMP CHIEF STRATEGIST IS CAUSING LEFT-WING MEDIA MELTDOWN, IT MEANS TRUMP DID THE RIGHT THING... HE'S PERFECT FOR THE SPOT!" and an entire vertical dedicated to "Hillary's Health." Why does fake news rise to the top of Google searches? Google uses algorithms to determine what websites appear in searches, crawling through websites and keywords to "find the appropriate pages" and ordering them in your search results. But in the aforementioned search results, the algorithm deemed a false, far-right blog post, a website dedicated to debunking rumors and an article about Google's spread of misinformation as the "appropriate pages" for "final election count." The failure of algorithms to differentiate reliable, unbiased news from sensationalism, hoaxes or factually incorrect "news" speaks to a larger issue at hand: While tech companies aren't responsible for writing the news, they are responsible for governing the news they distribute.  In other nooks of the web, massive sites like Facebook and Twitter have also seen their networks inundated with viral hoaxes — a pitfall that places the onus of fact-checking on its users. How does misinformation spread? "Personally I think the idea that fake news on Facebook, which is a very small amount of the content, influenced the election in any way — I think is a pretty crazy idea," Zuckerberg said two days after Trump was elected president, Quartz reported. "Voters make decisions based on their lived experience." Zuckerberg is downplaying the influence of his platform. Facebook is curating and delivering news to millions of people with its News Feed feature, which algorithmically ranks trending stories and presents them to you on your homepage. In a Facebook post, Zuckerberg claimed that "more than 99% of what people see [in the Trending section] is authentic." But studies show otherwise: BuzzFeed's analysis found "38% of all [hyperpartisan right-wing] posts were either a mixture of true and false or mostly false, compared to 19% of posts from three hyperpartisan left-wing pages that were either a mixture of true and false or mostly false." The Washington Post performed its own audit and found similar results. Twitter was also hit with a stream of hoaxes leading up to the election. Internet trolls schemed to flood the social media site with fake hashtags and memes in order to quell support for Clinton — they tried to dupe left-wing voters into casting their ballots via invalid methods like texting and tweeting. Six days before the election, Twitter finally addressed the voter suppression by blocking accounts. "Not sure how this slipped past us, but now it's fixed," Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said, according to BuzzFeed News.  Dangerous hate movements are entering the mainstream — and social media is responsible In New York magazine, Max Read argued that tech companies and their faulty algorithms had a decisive role in swinging the pendulum into Trump's camp. One major problem, he notes, is that Facebook's viral hoaxes look so real: "Many of those stories were lies, or 'parodies,' but their appearance and placement in a news feed were no different from those of any publisher with a commitment to, you know, not lying." Facebook, Google and Twitter's influence is undeniable. It's this influence that gave the far-right, white-nationalist platform Breitbart News a record audience — and paved the way for Breitbart executive chairman Stephen Bannon to become Trump's senior counselor and chief West Wing strategist. The real issue moving forward isn't just the continued spread of misinformation, as we saw in Monday's Google search result for the final election count — but also the dangerous ideologies that have taken center stage on social media, bolstered by Trump's campaign. In 2016, tech companies' determination to remain unbiased and not stir the political pot has inadvertently given white nationalism a major platform. When Trump supporters are able to silence victims of death threats on Facebook and use coded speech to spew racist abuse in plain sight on Twitter, it's time for these companies to reevaluate how much they lean on algorithms and consider their responsibility to govern the growing hate movements that have blossomed on them.

Most Popular GIF YouTube What's Inside By Eric Limer Nov 14, 2016 Snapchat's Spectacles, sunglasses with a camera embedded in the frame so you can take videos, are all the rage at the moment. Available for $130, but only from vending machines that pop up at random (or for way, way too much money on eBay), the camera specs are already far trendier than Google's ill-fated Glass could ever hope to be. But what are they, exactly? It only takes one pair and a Dremel to find out for sure. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below After getting their hands on a pair of the glasses, the folks over at What's Inside took to cutting a pair in half to figure out what's really going on in there, and the answer is actually quite simple. The specs have two yellow circles at the top, outside edge of each frame. One of these holds the camera, which shoots the video that plays back in a strange, circular aspect ratio. The other holds the lithium-ion battery (which obvious goes up in flames if you cut into it) and the Bluetooth guts that connect the frames to your phone. The two units are joined by a copper wire running through the frame, so make sure you don't snap them in half! Most Popular The coolest trick that the Spectacles can do isn't thanks to its (fairly simple) hardware, but rather software. Because the footage the camera actually captures is cropped into a circular type shape, Snapchat can pull of a very cool trick with the resulting video, letting it morph and change as you twist your phone while viewing it. Those who aren't understanding @Spectacles videos. Here's the only GIF you need. pic.twitter.com/CDXfCpM2PM — Raymond Wong 💾📼🍕 (@raywongy) November 14, 2016 Various apps from YouTube to Instagram to Vine (RIP) have been slowly legitimizing the once horrible sin of taking vertical video, either by supporting a vertical aspect ratios better or opting for something more square-shaped. Snapchat's cool little rotation trick, however, is probably the coolest solution so far. Here's to hoping that it catches on, even/especially for videos that aren't taken by some goofy-looking camera glasses.

SSLMate Features Cert Spotter Intro How It Helps How It Works PKI Threats PKI Failures Pricing API Open Source Pricing Blog Docs Log In Sign Up ← Back to blog September 7, 2016 Why Chrome 53 is Rejecting Chase Bank's Symantec Certificate Update (Thursday, November 10, 2016): Due to a bug in Chrome, versions of Chrome 53 that are more than 10 weeks old now display this error message for all websites using Symantec certificates that were issued on or after June 1, 2016 (including from Symantec-owned brands like Thawte and GeoTrust). As of Friday, November 11, 2016, Chrome users can simply restart Chrome to avoid the bug. Chromium users must upgrade. Website operators can switch to a certificate from a different certificate authority. (SSLMate issues Comodo certificates, which are not affected.) The rest of this post still applies to new versions of Chrome. If you're using Chrome 53, which was released last week, you might find that some websites which worked under Chrome 52 now fail with "Your connection is not private" with an error code of NET::ERR_CERTIFICATE_TRANSPARENCY_REQUIRED. For example, choosemyreward.chase.com shows the following error as of publication time: The short explanation is that Chase's system administrators made a mistake when they requested their SSL certificate from their certificate authority, Symantec, but as we shall see, Symantec shares responsibility too. The History of Certificate Transparency The security of HTTPS relies on organizations called certificate authorities, who issue certificates that help ensure your connections to websites are secure and private. HTTPS is only secure if certificate authorities do their job properly. If a certificate authority messes up and issues an unauthorized certificate, an attacker can use it to intercept HTTPS connections. Unfortunately, it's difficult to ensure that certificate authorities do their job properly, and certificate authorities have repeatedly violated the public's trust by issuing unauthorized certificates, including ones which have been used in real attacks against HTTPS connections. In response, Google created Certificate Transparency. Under Certificate Transparency, all certificates are submitted to publicly-auditable logs by either the certificate authority or a third-party observer such as the Googlebot. Domain owners can monitor these logs using a service like Cert Spotter and take action if they see an unauthorized certificate for one of their domains. Web browsers will eventually reject certificates that aren't logged using Certificate Transparency. However, Google is proceeding slowly towards mandatory logging so that they and others can gain operational experience first. The first milestone towards mandatory logging came in January 2015 when Chrome started requiring Certificate Transparency for Extended Validation certificates. The second milestone came last October, when Google caught Symantec, a large certificate authority, issuing unauthorized "test" certificates for google.com and 75 other domains. Since issuing certificates for a domain without its owner's approval is such a serious violation of trust, Google announced that Chrome would require Certificate Transparency for all certificates issued by Symantec on or after June 1, 2016. This change rolled out last week in Chrome 53. Symantec and Certificate Transparency Symantec is, for the most part, complying with Google's logging requirement, and by default any certificate they issue will be properly logged and will work in Chrome 53. However, Certificate Transparency has a downside: it requires the complete contents of every certificate, including the hostnames, to be logged to a public log. For a public website, this is no big deal, but some organizations prefer to keep the hostnames of their internal servers private. Even the hostnames of public websites might need to be kept private until a certain date to avoid leaking information such as new product announcements or corporate acquisitions. To address the privacy concerns, the IETF working group responsible for Certificate Transparency developed a redaction mechanism which would allow certificate authorities to redact components of the hostname beneath the registered domain. For example, a certificate for secretserver.secretdivision.example.com could be logged as ?.secretdivision.example.com, ?.?.example.com, but not ?.?.?.com. Redaction allows domain owners to keep their hostnames private, while still allowing them to detect that a certificate has been issued for some hostname under their domain. Unfortunately for Symantec, there were some obstacles in the way of offering redaction to their privacy-sensitive customers. First, redaction is only defined for the next version of Certificate Transparency, which is still a draft and has not been implemented by Chrome or any public log server. Second, the Chrome team has raised several concerns with redaction, and stated that Chrome will not support redaction unless their concerns are addressed. Partly because of Chrome's concerns, the IETF working group removed redaction from the next version of Certificate Transparency and placed it in a separate document which has not yet been officially adopted by the working group. Despite the fact that redaction, practically speaking, does not exist, Symantec forged ahead and grafted redaction onto the original version of Certificate Transparency. The result is a Franken-certificate that works fine in browsers that don't support Certificate Transparency, but fails to validate in Chrome. Pointless Redaction Symantec defaults to logging certificates in a compliant, unredacted form, but they provide their customers the option to log certificates in redacted form instead. Customers who choose this option get Franken-certificates that cause the above warning in Chrome 53. Despite the incompatibility with Chrome and the utter pointlessness of redacting the certificates of public websites, both Chase Bank and United Airlines have chosen to redact such certificates. United fixed their websites before Chrome 53 became stable by replacing their certificates with fully-logged ones, but as of publication time, choosemyreward.chase.com is still serving a Franken-certificate that's rejected by Chrome 53. Data collected from Certificate Transparency logs reveal quite a few other websites that are probably public yet use redaction, including websites at Amazon, Fedex, Goldman Sachs, Mitsubishi, and Siemens. Why would someone choose redacted logging for a public website? Symantec's documentation might be to blame. Their documentation describes the two options as follows: Full domain names: Publicly logs root domain names and subdomains in the certificate. Recommended for all public websites. Only root domain names: Publicly logs only root domain names in the certificate. Intended only for private internal domains. Although they say that logging root domain names is "intended only for private internal domains" while recommending full domain name logging for public websites, they don't mention the downside until later in the document: All certificates with root domain logging may display browser warnings when users connect to the website. Saying that a warning "may" be displayed doesn't seem adequate when a warning absolutely will be displayed, by the world's most popular web browser to boot! Symantec needs to do a better job informing their customers of the downsides of choosing redaction. Too many websites have chosen redaction incorrectly, and I expect this to continue unless Symantec improves their messaging. Meanwhile, Chrome users will encounter avoidable browser errors when visiting these websites, which is a horrible experience for Symantec's customer's customers, and risks desensitizing people to security warnings. Finally, if you represent an organization that wants to use redaction appropriately (that is, to hide the hostnames of a non-public server), please send an email to the IETF working group mailing list. The working group has had a difficult time designing redaction, and addressing Chrome's concerns will require hearing from the people who want to use redaction. The fate of redaction depends on your input! If you're worried about certificate authorities like Symantec issuing unauthorized "test" certificates for your domains, you should check out Cert Spotter, a tool to monitor Certificate Transparency logs for unauthorized certificates.

When users type in "final vote count 2016," the top item on Google News's search results is a blog called 70 News that incorrectly says Donald TrumpDonald TrumpThe Hill's 12:30 Report Why Trump should make Africa a foreign policy priority Bergdahl lawyers to ask for dismissal after Trump's inauguration MORE won both the Electoral College and the popular vote. The story, first reported by Mediaite, is drawing scrutiny on Google's search algorithm and adding fuel to criticisms that social media and search engines promoted incorrect news stories during the campaign. Searches for “final election results” and “final voting results” also displayed the fake news story earlier in the day. Now those searches results return a Washington Post story on 70 News as the top item. Despite the false story showing up prominently in Google News, the company has a summary box above the results displays the correct numbers. “To all the liberal loonies still rioting because you claim Trump did not get the popular vote, get your meds now and prepare to be shocked because the finals results are in,” the 70 News post’s author wrote, citing numbers from a tweet.

Facebook has also received significant scrutiny in the 2016 election for fake news stories on its platform.

The new version promises a better experience, consuming fewer resources. By Matt Asay | November 14, 2016, 11:35 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStockphoto/monsitj As the world shifts to mobile, Google is doing everything in its power to accelerate that shift, going so far as to take a mobile-first approach to its celebrated search index. Everything, that is, except improve the Chrome browser so that it doesn't greedily gobble every system resource it can find. Chrome has been such a hog that simply using Apple's Safari browser has become a sure-fire trick to gaining an extra hour of battery life. Finally, however, the Google Chrome team is catching up with the rest of Google's mobile militia, promising significant improvements to resource utilization in Chrome 55, an update promised for December 2016. For those of us who love the work Google has done to promote mobile, but have been frustrated by its foot-dragging on Chrome, this is very welcome news. Chrome keeps marching on despite itself Google Chrome has steadily gained market share for years, to the point that it has now displaced the hitherto dominant Internet Explorer on the desktop and Safari on mobile devices. Though once a rounding error, Google's combination of minimalistic design, integration of the search function, and raw speed put it ahead of more cumbersome browsers in terms of market share, both on the desktop: Desktop Browser Market Share, November 2016 Credit: Netmarketshare And on the increasingly important mobile devices (including smartphones and tablets): Smartphone/Tablet Browser Market Share, November 2016 Credit: Netmarketshare And yet, that original speed and performance advantage that Chrome could once credibly claim has vanished. Though some suggest that Chrome's prerendering and other functions offer ample rationale for Chrome's piggy ways, the fact remains that rival browsers like Safari manage to give a great experience without consuming all the RAM on one's machine. Praise Chrome 55 Fortunately, this is about to get better—much better—in Google's upcoming Chrome 55 release, due in December. According to the Google developers responsible for Chrome, "Over the last few months the V8 team analyzed and significantly reduced the memory footprint of several websites that were identified as representative of modern web development patterns." More about Mobility CIO Jury: 10 out of 12 tech leaders trust Samsung despite Galaxy Note7 failure IBM Watson is coming to the iPhone, and that's big news for business users Tech Pro Research: Social media policy Subscribe to TechRepublic's Mobile Enterprise newsletter How "significantly"? Heap memory is down roughly 50% on average, while zone memory falls 40%. In addition, "Reducing the V8 heap page size from 1M to 512KB results in a smaller memory footprint when not many live objects are present and lower overall memory fragmentation up to 2x." This, in turn, "allows V8 to perform more compaction work since smaller work chunks allow more work to be done in parallel by the memory compaction threads." While these improvements don't promise significant improvements to battery life, they're a step in the right direction. They're also in keeping with Google's other deeply significant work on prioritizing its mobile search index. This should push more publishers to similarly prioritize the optimization of content for the mobile devices that serve as umbilical cords for most of us. This should translate into a better mobile experience which, again, is where we spend most of our time.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Fake news is becoming a problem on social media and even Google. Regardless of where we stand politically, the results of the 2016 election will dominate the news cycle for a long time. That includes the frightening trend of fake news on social media, something that even Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has owned up to. In fact, fake news marked a portion of this weekend’s episode of Last Week Tonight from HBO and John Oliver. You can watch that here. I embedded it at the right time, but in case that doesn’t work the discussion about fake new starts at 12:15. Now, The Washington Post has a story on Google’s search engine falling victim to the problem. Following the election last week, Google offered the results on its search engine. The top news story it linked to for a while was literally faked and false. That story linked to this tweet as its source. Final #Election2016 Results By Numbers:- #PopularVote #electoralvotes pic.twitter.com/uKZevQvPfK — Michael (@Koxinga8) November 12, 2016 That Twitter user points to an article on a site called USASupreme.com for its source. That site offers no source for its count. That news story indicated that Trump had won the popular vote as well as the Electoral College votes, though that’s not true. At the most recent count, Clinton holds 61,039,676 of the popular vote compared to Trump with 60,371,193. Don’t trust everything you read online I’m not writing this story to highlight that difference; instead, I offer that it’s becoming a scary time to live as a reader of news online. If fake news outlets have become good enough to not only trick Facebook and Twitter users but Google’s algorithm itself, we have a serious problem on our hands. Zuckerberg’s saying that just 1 percent of news of Facebook is fake. That may or may not be true; but, that percentage doesn’t really indicate how much the fake news is actually shared. Sure 1 percent of the stuff posted on Facebook is fake, but how much more often is that fake news shared than the real stuff? How about if it’s especially inflammatory? As readers, we can’t take anything at face value. If a story seems too good to be true, check the organization and the linked sources. Perhaps platforms have a responsibility in this, too. I wouldn’t be opposed to Facebook adopting some sort of “verified” news outlet icon for bigger outlets. They have to do something to curb this stuff, right?

A partnership between the South Dakota State University Image Processing Laboratory and Google Earth made this possible. This image of the North America combines approximately 60,000 Landsat 8 images from July 2013 through December 2015. The red-orange areas are what imaging engineer Larry Leigh calls “gold nuggets,” areas that may one day be used to calibrate satellite sensors. Article ID: 664606 Released: 10-Nov-2016 3:05 PM EST Source Newsroom: South Dakota State University Add to Favorites more news from this source Share MEDIA CONTACT Available for logged-in reporters only CITATIONS CHANNELS Technology KEYWORDS satellite calibration, pseudo-invariant calibration sites, Google Earth Engine, Landsat Satellites, Satellite Imagery Analysis, South Dakota State University, SDSU Image Processing Laboratory + Show More Newswise — A South Dakota State University research team led by imaging engineer Larry Leigh has completed the first worldwide search for new satellite calibration sites through a partnership with Google Earth. The one-year project was made possible through a $46,000 Google Earth Engine research award. Through this collaboration, Leigh and his team of three graduate students have direct access to the Google archives that include EROS images and the computing power to compile the images via Google Earth Engine and its cloud computing capabilities. The primary project goal was to identify pseudo-invariant calibration sites or PICS. These are remote places, such as deserts and dry lake beds —where the surface properties and therefore the reflectance, do not change over time. PICS provide a less expensive means of calibrating satellites because it eliminates the need to gather measurements on the ground when the satellite is passing overhead. “When a satellite observes these test sites, it should measure the same amount of energy each time,” explained Dennis Helder, director of the SDSU Image Processing Laboratory. “You don't have to put a team in the field at the site or do a lot of data processing from the field team's measurements,” he pointed out. After these new sites are thoroughly characterized, Leigh said, “they can be used as routine calibration sites, thus increasing our frequency of observation and improving our ability to detect calibration drift in a much shorter time period.” Most satellites are calibrated on a somewhat irregular basis; however, the discovery of more sites may make daily calibration possible, he noted. Using nine spectral bands from Landsat 8, the team produced what Leigh called “our first-ever PICs global survey.” The global image, degraded to a 300-meter resolution, took nearly 350 hours to produce. “This output is being analyzed to generate a whole new list of PICs,” he added. However, he noted, Landsat 8 has only been in orbit a little over three years. The next step will be to run the Landsat 5 archive, which contains nearly 30 years of data—from March 1984 until June 2013. This will allow the researchers to evaluate the longevity of these new PICs and possibly use these sites to calibrate data from past Landsat missions. To identify PICS in the United States, Leigh and his team have produced a composite image containing 60,000 Landsat 8 images from July 2013 to December 2015. It took the 5,000-node cluster at Google approximately nine hours to compile the U.S. image at a degraded 900-meter, rather than the full 30-meter, pixel resolution. About SDSU Image Processing Laboratory The SDSU Image Processing Laboratory was started in 1988 to conduct research in satellite image processing. Research focuses primarily on radiometric characterization and calibration of satellite and airborne visible and near infrared remote sensing imaging systems. The lab works primarily with the Landsat series of sensors, but also has experience with high resolution commercial sensors such as Ikonos, Quickbird, and Orbview, RapidEye, Thaichote, and other moderate resolution sensors such as ALI and Hyperion. Projects have been primarily with USGS EROS (Sioux Falls, SD) and NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (Greenbelt, MD). Other areas of research include estimation of sensor point spread functions (or modulation transfer functions), and geometric characterization of sensor systems.

But what happens if you ask them about the competition? Curious, I did just that while testing the two smart speaker systems last week. It turns out that neither knows much about the other — or if they did, they didn’t want to acknowledge it. When I asked Google Home what it knew about Amazon Alexa — the name the company gives its virtual assistant technology — Home responded that it wasn’t “sure how to help.” I got essentially the same answer when I asked Home about Amazon Echo, the name of the smart speaker system. Echo was even less helpful. When I asked Alexa what it knew about Google Home, it didn’t even respond! Interestingly, the situation was different when it came to Siri, Apple’s virtual assistant that’s now built into its phones, tablets and computers. Both Home and Echo were able to tell me what Siri was. Citing Wikipedia, Home said Siri is “a computer program” that’s a part of the company’s operating systems. Alexa defined Siri as “Apple’s virtual assistant and phone control interface.” Not bad. Perhaps most tellingly of all, Siri was much more caught up on its two rivals than either were about each other. When I asked Siri about Home, she pointed me to the Wikipedia page describing the device. She did the same thing when I asked about Echo. Of course, Siri had her own problems, as she usually does. She too didn’t know what Amazon Alexa was. And the first time I asked her about Echo, she told me, “I can’t answer that.” She pointed me to the Wikipedia entry only after my second query. Ah, virtual assistants. It turns out they’re about as reliable as real assistants can be — maybe even less. Photo: Google Home (left), Amazon Echo.

Here’s how to link your Spotify account to your Google Home to play all of the third-party music you’d ever want. RELATED ARTICLE How to Set Up Google Home Just like Alexa, you can change the default music service. So, by simply saying “Ok Google, play The Weeknd”, it will automatically use Spotify to play music instead of Google Play. You can even tell Google Home to play a specific Spotify playlist. You can still use Google Play Music when you want—you just have to say “play Drake on Google Play Music”—it just won’t be the default. The same goes for Pandora as long as you have your Pandora account linked, or other services. When you first set up your Google Home device, it asked you to select a music provider that you wanted to use, so if you chose Spotify then and linked your account, then you’re good to go, but if you stuck with the default and are now wanting to switch to Spotify, here’s how to get started. First, open up the Google Home app on your smartphone and tap on the Devices button in the top-right corner of the screen. Next, tap on the menu button in the upper-right corner. Select “Settings”. Tap on “Music”. Choose “Spotify” from the list. A pop-up will appear telling you to link your Spotify account to your Google account. Tap “Link Account”. Tap on “Log In to Spotify”. Enter in your username and password for Spotify (or select “Log In with Facebook” if you usually log in that way) and then hit “Log In”. Tap “Okay” to confirm linking your Spotify account to your Google account. Spotify will now be your Google Home’s default music provider. If at any time you want to unlink your Spotify account, simply tap on “Unlink”. From now on, any music requests that you make to your Google Home will go through Spotify, and you can tell it to play your Spotify playlists without even saying “Spotify” at all. Simply saying “Ok Google, play my Christmas playlist” will tell the Google Home to search your Spotify library for that playlist and begin playing it.

 Snapchat is doing everything it can to avoid the creepy nerdiness of Google Glass Alex Heath Nov. 14, 2016, 3:13 PM 6,803 facebook linkedin twitter email print Spectacles marketing vs. an infamous photo of tech figure Robert Scoble wearing Google Glass in the shower. Snap / Robert Scoble The last thing Snap Inc. wants is for its new Spectacles to become the next Google Glass. Google released Glass in 2013 to much fanfare in the tech industry. Some thought the head-mounted display, which projected information like phone notifications and the weather over a glasses lense, would usher in the future of augmented reality computing. That didn't happen. Google Glass was a complete flop. Those who wore them were called "Glassholes." Google never iterated past a $1,500 developer prototype, and quietly killed the project two years later. Seriously, would you be caught wearing these on a date? Kyle Russell/Business Insider A pair of Spectacles is like the anti-Glass. For starters, there's no fancy augmented reality tech that displays visual information on top of the glasses as you wear them. People close to Snap say that kind of technology is part of the company's future roadmap, but it's a long way off. Instead, Spectacles are ultra-simple and designed to look like a quirky pair of Ray-Bans. They record 10-second clips of video that get sent straight to the Snapchat app. They only cost $130. This simplicity is very much by design, and it's why Snap CEO Evan Spiegel called Spectacles a "toy" when they were first announced.  Snap employees are terrified of Spectacles being perceived in the same kind of creepy, nerdy way that Google Glass was, according to someone familiar with their thinking. It's why that Spectacles light up around the camera while recording — to help people feel like they're not being constantly monitored. And it's why Spectacles are marketed like this: Snapchat And not like this: Glass Collective Snapchat is already beloved by young people. By selling Spectacles through bright yellow vending machines that pop up in one city for 24 hours and then disappear (like messages in the app), Snap is setting itself up its glasses as a cool, exclusive status symbol out of the gate. And by all indications the approach is working. While the glasses have so far only been on sale for in Venice Beach and Big Sur, early reviews are overwhelmingly positive. Pairs of Spectacles are reselling for thousands of dollars on eBay. People are frantically tweeting about where to find the next vending machine pop-up. It's still too early to tell if Spectacles will be a success, but they already have the cool factor that Glass never had. And as long as Robert Scoble doesn't wear them in the shower, they have a shot at staying cool. Chances are slim that I'll get a pair of @Spectacles. Which sucks when I've seen people walking away with multiples :/. pic.twitter.com/OyJl9ZVfFM — David McGreavy (@DominusNoctis) November 10, 2016 SEE ALSO: Everything you need to know about Snapchat's Spectacles glasses, including how to buy them NOW WATCH: A hacker reveals a simple way to come up with a strong password that's easy to remember Loading video...

Google traffic is lucrative – there’s no doubt about that. Often, the most effective way to attract targeted traffic is to make sure your site is optimized for Google searches. As you may have already learned, winning that targeted traffic is one of the top strategies for making money on the web. However (and this is a big however), depending solely on Google organic search is not a good business model. Google frequently issues algorithm updates. This can lead to webmasters/bloggers losing all their traffic overnight. You need to diversify the ways that you draw online users to your site. Sure, Google search is a big part of that process – but it isn’t the only way to do it. You can still rely on organic search, but don’t make yourself vulnerable to another algorithm update before you have time to optimize for it. In fact, Google just released another Penguin update on September 23rd. Penguin 4.0 is supposed to be the final update of its kind. That’s because the algorithm will now run in real time, which means it will actually be updating on a continuous basis. How this may affect websites across the board remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: Business owners need to grow without being entirely reliant on the traffic from Google search. This is the perfect time to revisit my previous post and explore more ways to grow without Google traffic. What Happened to Me in 2012 Penguin Updates I know firsthand how a business can be affected by an update to the Google algorithm complex. My site, WebHostingSecretRevealed.com, was hit badly during the Google Penguin update in 2012. This forced me to rework everything from scratch again on a new domain: WebHostingSecretRevealed.net. Since then, I have been experimenting with different ways to pull in targeted traffic outside organic search. You can read how Darren lost 80% of his traffic overnight and what he did about it here. In previous posts, I have talked about some of the tactics I’ve learned and used to build a Google-less approach to attracting blog traffic. In this post, we are going to dig wider and deeper for more Google-less traffic strategies. Tactic #1: Content Swap Previously, I’ve discussed how guest posting is the best way to build sustainable web traffic. This concept is still valid two years after I first talked about it. Here’s an example: I published a guest post on Blogging Wizard in April two years ago. The post somehow gained popularity, and Mari Smith tweeted about the post. This led to some new traffic and Twitter followers for me – not to mention building my authority in the niche. The trick, again, is to guest post at the right place – Google PageRank or Domain Authority is never my main concern. What we want is influential blogs with real readers who will read and engage with your content. Guest post to build web traffic and your personal brand – not for Google PageRank. Never underestimate how effective it is to reach out to peers and influencers. Getting the word out about your own blog is much easier to do when you can collaborate with other bloggers. At this point, you might be thinking “But wait – researching for the right blog and reaching out to the right bloggers for guest posting opportunities requires lots of work!” Well, what if we can speed up that process and write more (and eliminate a lot of that work)? This is when Content Swap becomes the best tactic to use – the one that will help you to get the most from your efforts. So, What Is Content Swap? The idea of Content Swap came from Ken Lyons of Measured SEM. While Ken was suggesting swapping guest posts to build links, it may also work as a great way to bring more traffic to your blog. Without Content Swap, you must reach out to each blog and ask for a guest posting opportunity. This can be a tedious and time-consuming task. When you employ Content Swap as a tactic, you are in the driver’s seat. Guest posting opportunities will come to you instead of you being forced to seek them out endlessly. All you need to do is select the sites that meet your specific quality thresholds: You determine such details as the amount of traffic that meets your needs, how many social media followers the site should have, and other relevant factors. Then, choose those blog sites that fit your criteria. Steps to take for getting started with Content Swap: Set up a proper “write for us” page on your blog. Explain clearly what types of guest bloggers you’re looking for (and make it clear that you want to swap content with them). Share the page on your social media pages and forum signatures to increase the chances of being seen. You can also promote the page on Facebook to a specific audience (namely, those who own blogs). Sit back and wait for guest posting requests. (Self-plug #1: If setting up a “Write for Us” page is too much for you, you can swap content with us at WHSR.) Tactic #2: Influencers Marketing Now that you know about the importance of exchanging content – and how much easier it is to do this by using the Content Swap method – you’ll still need to do some footwork while you wait for guest bloggers to respond to your “write for us” page. The kind of blogger outreach I’m talking about now involves targeting influencers. Doing this is a bit more time-intensive than placing a call-out to other bloggers on your own website. The time you invest in this strategy can yield repeated returns for you, however. It’s also a way to identify which bloggers might be the best to swap content with once those offers start coming to you. Start by identifying the influencers who are blogging about topics that are relevant to you. You can build a spreadsheet to keep track of them all. You’ll find a wealth of blogs on every imaginable topic at a site like Alltop, for one. Just enter a keyword in the search box on the Alltop home page. That should produce a page with several blogs and subtopics that you can browse. Once you find bloggers who seem like suitable choices as influencers, use an analytics tool to find out how much influence they have on social media. One analytics site I’ve had success with is Klout. What can you do once you find the influencers you want to contact? Invite them to be interviewed by you on your blog. Ask them to collaborate on blog posts. Suggest swapping blog posts with them – as well as swapping links to your respective sites. Real life examples – Making friends” is often under-rated in blogging world. Michael Pozdnev reached out to 63 industry leaders and wrote this incredibly long post. It was the fourth posts he published on his blog IWannaBeABlogger.cm and the post has obtained more than 2,000 social media shares and comments to date. All of these actions will help build traffic to your site, and you won’t need to worry about where you rank on results pages. Tactic #3: Pour Oil on the Fire You can look closely to your existing traffic for more ideas on how to grow it. Previously, I covered five different tactics: 1) Blog commenting 2) Freebies marketing 3) Crowd sourcing post 4) Creative social media marketing and 5) Leveraging Q&A platforms. Are you using any of these strategies? Did any of these work particularly well for your blog? Look into your Google Analytics and find out how these tactics have helped your blog to grow in the past. Figure what is serving you well, and double up your efforts on the tactics that work. A Real-Life Example – Pinterest In the first half of 2015, we noticed that posts focusing on mom bloggers were drawing a lot of Pinterest traffic. Thus, we built more topics for this demographic; we then hired a part-time Pinterest marketer to help us promote our posts on Pinterest. The results were a 160% increase in Pinterest referrals and 40% percent more newsletter signups from this traffic source. How do you like 160% more Pinterest traffic and 40% better signup rate? What you can do: Look into your Google Analytics, and examine your top 50 traffic sources (follow this search path): Dashboard > Acquisition > All Traffic > Source/Medium > Show rows: 50 – Can you see a particular type of traffic source that is working exceptionally well? Do you know why it works so well? Can you invest more money, time, or manpower in that source to make it better? Tactic #4: Building an Email List Darren recently talked about the importance of building an email list: “Turn a visit into a regular weekly reader and you are effectively getting 52 readers a year.” Darren started out with only 17 subscribers (four of those were his family members and himself). Today, he manages a list of 700,000 subscribers. Imagine the amount of traffic you could get from a list that size! Like Darren, you can build a list of loyal subscribers by converting one-time or occasional visitors into weekly followers. Here are a few tips: Make visitors want more Publish compelling content, so people who just happen upon your site will want to stay connected to it. Provide users with valuable information that they will want to access on an ongoing basis. Media rich content Back up that text with audio (such as podcasts) and visuals (such as colorful infographics and videos) to keep your visitors interested. Place an opt-in form in plain sight Make sure that your visitors see your opt-in form on every page of your website. They may not always want to sign up for your list on the first page they land on, but they might want to do it after browsing for a while. Don’t let them miss out on that opportunity – make it available in the sidebar of most of your pages (if not all of them). Give them an offer they can’t refuse If you want people to subscribe to your email list, offer them something in return (like an eBook when they register). Don’t stop at the initial registration offer Once you start building your list, keep the momentum going by offering your subscribers more content they can use. Send enticing content in your newsletters, such as monthly webinars or discounts on products. Tactic #5: Leveraging Facebook I don’t think you need me to tell you that it’s extremely naïve to ignore Facebook. (Fun fact: At last check, Darren posts 3 – 5 posts per day on Facebook.) Facebook and the Facebook-owned WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger are the most popular social networks worldwide. Facebook could actually send more traffic to your blog than Google. At least, that’s what’s happening with Parse.ly’s network of 400 digital publishers. Here are two very effective Facebook advertising tactics you can try: 1. Revive Old Post Carousel Ads Below is a carousel ad I did recently to promote my evergreen blogging tips. The ads cost less than 50 cents per click, and I am drawing hundreds of visits per week to my blog. When you are targeting the right audience, the advertising cost on Facebook is relatively cheap. When you consider how huge the impact can be, you almost can’t afford not to advertise this way. (Self-plug #2 – By the way I compile our best blogging tips in this page). You may also use carousel ads on Instagram, which Facebook bought a few years ago. By telling a story in this type of ad, you can compel viewers to learn more about your business. They may then click on the link that leads to your website. Now, you have just attracted traffic without depending on the Google organic search function to do it. Here’s another reason to create this type of ad to market your business: According to Digiday, carousel ads get 10 times the clicks of ordinary Facebook ads – and they drive 10 times the amount of traffic to the websites of their advertisers. That means that the ads are helping you to work smart instead of work hard, and they’re saving you some serious advertising dollars. 2. Influence the influencers: Ads targeting Facebook Page admin Do you have some handy tips or experiences to share with Facebook page administrators? Can you create some to target this group of people? The idea here is to influence the influencers. If you market something effectively to Facebook page admins – be it a post or a product – you can get far more traction from your campaign than if you were to just target ordinary users. Why is this? Because a Facebook page admin has the “power of publisher”. Page admins usually have a group of followers themselves. If you manage to win them over, they could help you to amplify your message. Do you see how much more efficient this is as a marketing technique than conventional methods that have been used by everyone? Here’s how you can target Facebook page admins (follow this search path): Facebook Ad Manager > Power Editor > Create Saved Audience > Detailed Targeting > Digital Activities > Facebook Page Admins This is just the beginning… As mentioned in my previous article, appealing to web traffic is only part of the game. You Will Also Need to Focus On… Conversion Once you get people to your website, you’ll then need to turn those visits into conversions. You must optimize your landing pages to turn site visits into leads and leads into sales. Make the pages easy to navigate, so visitors can quickly move on from them when they want to explore your website. Run A/B testing and analytics so that you can improve the aspects of your landing pages that are not keeping people on your site. Creating opportunities to remarket By collecting emails via your opt-in forms, you can reach out to the site visitors that you didn’t convert the first time. Remarketing also enables you to maintain long-term customer relationships; you can make repeated sales to those customers; and ultimately, that is one of the best ways to keep growing your brand. As a blogger, you need to optimize your content in order to get targeted traffic. This absolutely includes optimization for Google search results. However, building an audience involves a lot more than getting traffic from organic search. Don’t leave your blog vulnerable the way that mine was a few years ago. SEO is only one strategy among several that can help you achieve your blogging goals. By swapping content, reaching out to influencers, developing an email list, and taking advantage of the tools on Facebook, you can draw targeted traffic and grow your blog.

Not only is glass more fragile than metal, the glass Google used on the back isn’t as strong as the front glass, making the entire back panel prone to scratches. You’d think that as long as you’re not laying the phone down on concrete, this wouldn’t be an issue but — throughout the course of our Pixel’s life and laying it on various wood surfaces, dinning tables, etc. — you’ll find that fine scratches quickly start adding up. You may remember not too long ago when another glass-backed Google flagship was released — the Nexus 4 — and users quickly discovered how fragile having a thin sheet of glass covering the back really was. Aside from small drops, even quick changes in temperature were causing the back to crack, forcing Google to release slightly revised models with little bumper tabs on the back. It was such an easy solution, I thought it be great to do something similar with the Pixel. Of course buying a case is an easy option for some, but there are those who prefer using their device completely naked, feeling the cold aluminum and every curve of the phone the way the manufacturer intended. Lately, I’ve found myself falling into this camp. So, instead of using a bulky case just to protect the glass from scratches, I decided to try something I already had in my home: Puffy Paint. Optional: add dots on the bottom to elevate the metal back from hard surfaces as well It may sound crazy, but Puffy Paint — also known as 3D fabric paint — is thick enough that applying two little dots on the sides of the glass elevates it just enough that it never touches the surface of wherever you lay it down. It’s also strong enough that it wont come off easily when pulling it in and out of your pockets, but can still be cleanly removed with your fingernail. If you also don’t like the idea of the aluminum portion laying on hard surfaces, feel free to use dots on the bottom portion as well. Having little bumper tabs on the back of the Pixel is so obvious, we just don’t know why Google (or HTC, rather) didn’t think of it first. In either case, those that love using their phone naked (the phone, not the person) may want to considering trying this little trick. You can find Puffy Paint in various colors at Walmart for about $1 a bottle, or you can get a 6-pack on Amazon right here which includes all of the Pixel colors (white, black, and blue).

Relative to the root of mozilla-central, the sandbox exists at: security/sandbox The chromium sandbox is based on the chromium base libraries (Google's code) which are located at: security/sandbox/chromium/base There is also partial/shim code to get the base code compiling with our SDK build settings or to limit the base code by reducing dependencies at: security/sandbox/chromium-shim/base The chromium Windows sandbox itself (Google's code) is located at: security/sandbox/chromium/sandbox/win Processes Overview There are 2 processes when dealing with a sandboxed application: The broker: The parent process that starts sandboxed children The target: The child process that is sandboxed Both processes make use of the chromium sandbox library, but they make use of it indirectly through 2 libraries (Mozilla code). This indirect use of the library is due to header conflicts with the ipc layer where it has a different, much older, non compatible, copy of the chromium base library (bug 925471): For the broker, ./security/sandbox/win/src/sandboxbroker For the target, ./security/sandbox/win/src/sandboxtarget Build settings To disable building the sandbox completely build with this in your mozconfig: ac_add_options --disable-sandbox To disable just the content sandbox parts: ac_add_options --disable-content-sandbox Environment variables Disable content process sandbox MOZ_DISABLE_CONTENT_SANDBOX Disable media plugin sandbox MOZ_DISABLE_GMP_SANDBOX Disable NPAPI process sandbox MOZ_DISABLE_NPAPI_SANDBOX Allow weaker than default sandbox level MOZ_ALLOW_WEAKER_SANDBOX Enable sandbox logging MOZ_WIN_SANDBOX_LOGGING Key source code locations The sandboxed target process lowers its own privileges after initialization via these calls: Content process GMP process NPAPI process Level descriptions header: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/security/sandbox/chromium/sandbox/win/src/security_level.h The call that starts the sandboxed process in Firefox is: https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/918df3a0bc1c/ipc/glue/GeckoChildProcessHost.cpp#1030 All of the code that sets policies can be found here: http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/security/sandbox/win/src/sandboxbroker/sandboxBroker.cpp OSX The OSX sandbox is based on the TrustedBSD MAC Framework. It is undocumented and considered private by Apple. Mozilla OSX Sandbox Ruleset wiki page OSX Sandbox OSX sandbox policy language Linux Seccomp stands for secure computing mode. It's a simple sandboxing tool in the Linux kernel, available since Linux version 2.6.12. When enabling seccomp, the process enters a "secure mode" where a very small number of system calls are available (exit(), read(), write(), sigreturn()). Writing code to work in this environment is difficult; for example, dynamic memory allocation (using brk() or mmap(), either directly or to implement malloc()) is not possible. Seccomp-BPF is a more recent extension to seccomp, which allows filtering system calls with BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) programs. Most of our Linux user base have systems that support seccomp-bpf. These filters can be used to allow or deny an arbitrary set of system calls, as well as filter on system call arguments (numeric values only; pointer arguments can't be dereferenced). Additionally, instead of simply terminating the process, the filter can raise a signal, which allows the signal handler to simulate the effect of a disallowed system call (or simply gather more information on the failure for debugging purposes). Seccomp-bpf is available since Linux version 3.5 and is usable on the ARM architecture since Linux version 3.10. Several backports are available for earlier kernel versions. For limitations that apply to the semantics of system calls (e.g., “can this process access the filesystem”, not “can this process use system call #83”) we require unprivileged user namespaces, which a large majority of desktop users don't support. Specifically: chroot()ing into a deleted directory to revoke FS access, and namespace unsharing for networking, SysV IPC if possible, and process IDs. seccomp-bpf filtering rules for various processes Environment variables Enable sandbox logging MOZ_SANDBOX_VERBOSE Bug Lists Milestones Windows Content Process sbwc1 Roll out level 1 sandbox policy to release.

But privilege escalation via kernel vulnerabilities is relatively common, so we also use the seccomp-bpf system call filter to reduce the attack surface that a compromised content process can directly access.

Under that, Google lists some related news articles. At the top this morning, with an accompanying photo: a story arguing that Donald Trump won both the popular and electoral votes. That’s not true. The Daily Show’s Dan Amira noticed that numbers were being spread on social media that linked back to the “70 News” site. The 70 News article cites its source as a tweet, which cites as its source USASupreme.com, another random website which doesn’t actually include the numbers themselves. It does, however, argue that Hillary Clinton is “probably not going to win the actual number of votes cast. She may win the number of votes counted, but not the votes cast.” That distinction is … not really clear, except that the author, “Alex,” seems to believe that absentee ballots are only counted if the tally could make the difference in the election. Related Articles November 15, 2016 Mexico weighs grim prospect of deportation wave under Trump November 15, 2016 Report warns of Asia arms race if Trump withdraws U.S. forces November 15, 2016 Trump victory could imperil Roe v. Wade abortion ruling November 15, 2016 People donating to Planned Parenthood in Mike Pence’s name November 14, 2016 SEC chair to step down, clearing path for Trump to eliminate tough Wall Street regulations That’s not true, either. In light gray text above the link to 70 News, Google relays the actual current tally of counted votes: Clinton has a lead of about 700,000. That lead has grown since Election Day and will almost certainly continue to grow, since millions of the votes being counted are from California, and the plurality of those votes are from very-Clinton-friendly Los Angeles County. The source behind the “USA Supreme” website isn’t clear. It looks an awful lot like Prntly, a made-up news website we looked at earlier this year. Founded by a former convict named Alex Portelli, Prntly is part of the broad diaspora of websites that takes news about American politics, frames it in a pro-Trump way (often at the expense of accuracy) and then peppers the page with ads. In an email, Portelli denied involvement in USA Supreme, suggesting that it was the work of a group of young people in Macedonia first reported by BuzzFeed. These sites leverage the inability of Facebook and other social media sites to weed out nonsense in order to get clicks and make money from advertising — a remarkably lucrative endeavor, particularly in a country where the U.S. dollar stretches a lot further. Why Google includes 70 News as a news source isn’t clear. Among the main categories of news stories the site lists in its header is “Hillary’s Health,” which links to a number of rumors about the health of the Democratic nominee. Under “Politics” is a story that, among other things, links the Council on American-Islamic Relations to Al Qaeda. Another story suggests that protestors against Trump in California were being paid to do so. 70 News has added a header to its post about the election results. “Anyone asking where I got the figures, it was from twitter posts. Knowing the Democrat media have been dragging their liberal feet giving Michigan to Trump – finally they did, with Arizona finally declared two days ago – Trump now has the 309. Except for the twitter posts, the popular vote number still need to be updated in Wikipedia or MSM media – which may take another few days because the liberals are still reeling and recovering from Trump-shock victory. If I’m wrong, I won’t hesitate to change the numbers. It’s the job of the establishment media to tell the people the final numbers when it’s out there already.” None of that is true, either. The “establishment media” has regularly updated election results, showing Clinton with a wide popular vote lead. The reason that Michigan hasn’t been called is that Trump’s lead is 12,000 votes, and the results haven’t been finalized. New Hampshire also hasn’t been called for Clinton; her lead there is under 3,000 votes. “Alex” is wrong; he’s hesitating to change the numbers. If you’re interested in tracking the final vote tallies in the presidential race, you can simply search Google and keep an eye out for the small print under the electoral college totals. If you also see an article from a random site you’ve never heard of? I might recommend you take its numbers with a grain of salt.

Submit Your Site HomeScottsboro Trials, Google Daydream View, Snapchat, More: Thursday Afternoon Buzz, November 10, 2016 Scottsboro Trials, Google Daydream View, Snapchat, More: Thursday Afternoon Buzz, November 10, 2016 November 10, 2016November 10, 2016 ResearchBuzz afternoonbuzz NEW RESOURCES The University of Alabama has launched a new online archive about the Scottsboro trials. “In 1931, nine African American teenagers were accused of raping two White women on a train. The defendants were apprehended in Alabama and were tried, convicted, and sentenced to death in Scottsboro, Alabama. The case was appealed and dragged on for many years. During the appeals processes, one of the women who had claimed to have been raped recanted her story and said she had never been touched by the defendants. However, the guilty verdicts were upheld.” TWEAKS AND UPDATES Google Daydream View is now available. “From seeing a dinosaur come back to life, to traveling to the farthest reaches of Pluto, to saving a runaway goat from dangerous traps, Daydream brings you on immersive virtual reality adventures powered by a smartphone. And now you can experience it all with Daydream View, a VR headset and controller made by Google available in stores today…” You know, I really need to get into Snapchat. But I’m terrible at it. I have nobody to snap with. Snapchat lets you surround yourself with confetti, clouds and butterflies. “The chat and entertainment app’s latest updates includes new effects that overlay virtual objects in photos and videos. Golden butterflies flutter around a room, or clouds with faces float overhead. An airhorn hovers in the image, and when pressed on the screen, unleashes a blaring sound and showers confetti.” More Instagram updates. From TechCrunch: Instagram will now let creators add URL links, tag friends, and create Boomerangs in Stories. “Starting today the company will let creators add URL links to their stories that viewers can navigate to without leaving Instagram, add the ability for users to be ‘@ mentioned’ in someone’s story, and add the ability to add a Boomerang to your story without having to go create one in the separate Boomerang app.” USEFUL STUFF I’m just trying to keep you hip (not really): Mannequin Challenge is the internet’s newest obsession. “Social media’s been rocked by a new trend that involves doing nothing whatsoever. Seriously. Well, not quite. The #MannequinChallenge requires groups of participants to assume a dramatic pose (could be anything) while hip hop duo Rae Sremmurd’s new song “Black Beatles” blares in the background.” AROUND THE SEARCH AND SOCIAL MEDIA WORLD Okayyyyyy: apparently Google tried to acquire Reddit in 2005? “Google attempted to acquire Reddit back in the site’s early days in 2005, cofounder Alexis Ohanian said at a press conference at Web Summit in Lisbon on Thursday.” This is probably supposed to be a marketing gimmick. Speaking as a consumer it comes off as irritating. But Snapchat is really good at making correct moves, so what do I know. CNET: You can buy Snapchat Spectacles today (if you’re lucky). “Forget preorders or waltzing into a Best Buy. Instead, you’ll need to hunt down a Snapbot, a vending machine just for selling Spectacles. It seems Snapchat has just one vending machine that will be journeying across the US, one spot at a time. You can expect the locations to be big cities or densely populated areas, like New York and Los Angeles, for example. The first stop is Santa Monica, California.” SECURITY/LEGAL ISSUES And it’s Sophos with the patch Tuesday roundup. “Microsoft’s latest Patch Tuesday is out, even if Redmond’s monthly updates haven’t officially been called ‘patches’ for more than two years now. There are 14 bulletins this time around, broken down in severity as follows…” Yikes! Apparently an iPhone bug can force iPhones to repeatedly dial 911. “Last month, we covered the arrest of a teenager who utilized a bug to spread a malicious link on Twitter that forced iPhones to repeatedly call 911. And now, we finally know how the bug actually works.” RESEARCH AND OPINION WECT: Friendly competition on social media may get you to the gym. “Social media can be a powerful motivating tool. But if your goal is to get to the gym more often, competition beats friendly support on social networking sites, a new study contends.” Good afternoon, Internet… Do you like ResearchBuzz?

(The Washington Post) By  The Washington Post The Times-Picayune Follow on Twitter on November 14, 2016 at 1:49 PM Print Email If you headed to Google to learn the final results of the presidential election Monday morning (Nov. 14), the search engine helpfully walked through the final electoral vote tallies and number of seats won by each party in the House and Senate. Under that, Google listed some related news articles. At the top Monday morning, with an accompanying photo: a story arguing that Donald Trump won both the popular and electoral votes. That's not true. The Daily Show's Dan Amira noticed that numbers were being spread on social media that linked back to the "70 News" site. The 70 News article cites its source as a tweet, which cites as its source USASupreme.com, another random website which doesn't actually include the numbers themselves. It does, however, argue that Hillary Clinton is "probably not going to win the actual number of votes cast. She may win the number of votes counted, but not the votes cast." That distinction is ... not really clear, except that the author, "Alex," seems to believe that absentee ballots are only counted if the tally could make the difference in the election. That's not true, either. In light gray text above the link to 70 News, Google relays the actual current tally of counted votes: Clinton has a lead of about 700,000. That lead has grown since Election Day and will almost certainly continue to grow, since millions of the votes being counted are from California, and the plurality of those votes are from very-Clinton-friendly Los Angeles County. The source behind the "USA Supreme" website isn't clear. It looks an awful lot like Prntly, a made-up news website we looked at earlier this year. Founded by a former convict named Alex Portelli, Prntly is part of the broad diaspora of websites that takes news about American politics, frames it in a pro-Trump way (often at the expense of accuracy) and then peppers the page with ads. In an email, Portelli denied involvement in USA Supreme, suggesting that it was the work of a group of young people in Macedonia first reported by BuzzFeed. These sites leverage the inability of Facebook and other social media sites to weed out nonsense in order to get clicks and make money from advertising -- a remarkably lucrative endeavor, particularly in a country where the U.S. dollar stretches a lot further. Why Google includes 70 News as a news source isn't clear. Among the main categories of news stories the site lists in its header is "Hillary's Health," which links to a number of rumors about the health of the Democratic nominee. Under "Politics" is a story that, among other things, links the Council on American-Islamic Relations to Al Qaeda. Another story suggests that protestors against Trump in California were being paid to do so. 70 News has added a header to its post about the election results. "Anyone asking where I got the figures, it was from twitter posts. Knowing the Democrat media have been dragging their liberal feet giving Michigan to Trump - finally they did, with Arizona finally declared two days ago - Trump now has the 309. Except for the twitter posts, the popular vote number still need to be updated in Wikipedia or MSM media - which may take another few days because the liberals are still reeling and recovering from Trump-shock victory. If I'm wrong, I won't hesitate to change the numbers. It's the job of the establishment media to tell the people the final numbers when it's out there already." None of that is true, either. The "establishment media" has regularly updated election results, showing Clinton with a wide popular vote lead. The reason that Michigan hasn't been called is that Trump's lead is 12,000 votes, and the results haven't been finalized. New Hampshire also hasn't been called for Clinton; her lead there is under 3,000 votes. "Alex" is wrong; he's hesitating to change the numbers. If you're interested in tracking the final vote tallies in the presidential race, you can simply search Google and keep an eye out for the small print under the electoral college totals. If you also see an article from a random site you've never heard of? I might recommend you take its numbers with a grain of salt. Philip Bump writes about politics for The Fix.

With this update, the service will use machine learning to present a user with personalized music recommendations based on “signals” such as their location, current activity and the weather. For instance, a selection of workout music may appear when a user walks into a gym. Google said users can opt in to receive these personalized recommendations. In addition, the app’s home screen has been updated to provide users with additional personalized content. In a blog post, Elias Roman, lead product manager of Google Play Music, explained: The new Google Play Music has a brand new home screen built just for you. Think of it as the ultimate personal DJ—one who listens not only to what you like, but also when you like it, so that the music that you care about now is always at the top of your screen. Maybe that’s your favorite new release on Friday, the dance party playlist you listen to after work or more music from a new artist you’ve just fallen in love with. Regardless, it will be there waiting for you to press play.

The indications were that you would no longer need a compatible head unit in your car, instead, you would be able to use Android Auto with nothing more than your smartphone. It was unknown when Google was planning to release the new version of Android Auto, but it seems today is that day. The company has started sending out emails to everyone who signed up to be notified when the update would be released. This update allows anyone with an Android phone (running 5.0 or later) to use a driver friendly interface to access the key stuff you need on the road ― directions, music, communications ― without the distraction of things that aren’t essential while driving. Now that the app is available for download, we were able to take a quick look at what is being offered, and are pretty impressed so far. Being able to access Maps, your music app of choice, and the Phone conveniently is awesome and promises to help keep your eyes where they belong while driving. What’s even better is that there is a new collection of apps within the Play Store that allows you to view and download different apps. These apps are already updated with Android Auto support and include: Pandora Radio WhatsApp Messenger Kik Spotify Music Telegram Pocket Casts Hangouts WHAT’S NEW Android Auto now works with any car! Use it directly on your phone screen Android Auto on your phone screen can start automatically when connecting to your car’s Bluetooth Even more compatible apps: http://g.co/androidauto Send a customized reply message with a single tap Scroll through song lists more easily with the new letter jump feature Google claims the new Android Auto app is available for download in more than 30 countries.

The incorrect results were shown Monday in a two-day-old story posted on the pro-Trump "70 News" site. A link to the site appeared at or near the top of Google's influential rankings of relevant news stories for searches on the final election results. Google acknowledged the problem, although as of mid-afternoon Monday, the link to "70 News" remained prominent in its results.

Google's search engine is highlighting an inaccurate story claiming that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump won the popular vote in the Nov. 8, 2016, election, the latest example of bogus information spread by the internet's gatekeepers. (AP Photo/Virginia Mayo, File) Although Google rarely removes content from its search results, the company is taking steps to punish sites that manufacture falsehoods. In a move disclosed Monday, Google says it will prevent its lucrative digital ads from appearing on sites that "misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information." The action could give sites a bigger incentive to get things right or risk losing a valuable source of revenue. FAKE NEWS ON STEROIDS False information is nothing new on the internet, where debunkers have been batting down unfounded claims and urban legends for more than two decades. But the problem has gained more attention in the post-mortem of a bitterly contested presidential election in which Trump, a Republican billionaire and former reality TV star, defeated Hillary Clinton, a Democrat and former U.S. secretary of state who had been leading in the polls. Trump wound up prevailing in enough key states to win the Electoral College's decisive vote, but is trailing Clinton in the overall popular vote with some ballots still being counted. Clinton's lead in the popular vote has become one of the flashpoints in the protests against Trump's election being staged in cities across the country. Google is just the latest company in the crosshairs. Fake news stories uncritically circulated during and after the election on Facebook have sparked a debate over the role of social media companies, which are key sources of news for large numbers of people. Critics suggest that these companies should be more careful to ensure they aren't passing along misleading information. SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE NEWS Google's dominant search engine is the leading source of traffic to media sites, according to the online analytics firm Chartbeat. Meanwhile, a study by the Pew Research Center found about 60 percent of Americans get at least some of their news from social media sites such as Facebook, which now has 178 million users in the U.S. and Canada. In the election's aftermath, Facebook has been accused of possibly swaying the election's outcome by promoting fake news stories on its social network. Last summer, the company fired a handful of journalists who oversaw its "trending" news list and replaced them with an algorithm; fake news stories quickly began to trend. CEO Mark Zuckerberg brushed off that criticism as "crazy " in an appearance last week. He elaborated in a Saturday post on Facebook in which he asserted that "more than 99 percent of what people see" on Facebook is authentic. Zuckerberg conceded more needs to be done to block bogus information, but said that determining what's blatantly wrong isn't always an easy task. "Identifying the 'truth' is complicated," Zuckerberg wrote. "While some hoaxes can be completely debunked, a greater amount of content, including from mainstream sources, often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted." The stories featured in the feeds of Facebook users are primarily selected by automated formulas known as algorithms. Google's search results are also powered by algorithms that the company regularly revises to thwart sites that attempt to artificially boost their prominence. MORE, BETTER ALGORITHMS? Google conceded its search engine misfired with the 70 News story that falsely declared Trump the popular vote winner in both its headline and the body of the text. "In this case we clearly didn't get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms," the company said in a statement. Bad information in an online headline or at the top of a story can be particularly damaging. Roughly 53 percent of the people who land on a web page stay for 15 seconds or less, according to Chartbeat's findings. Incorrect information is bound to ripple across the internet as more people rely on their phones, computers and other digital devices to read news that is picked out for them by automated programs, said media analyst Ken Doctor of Newsonomics. "What we are seeing is the failure of the algorithm," Doctor said. "These algorithms bring a lot of things into our lives that humans cannot do. But when algorithms fail, it highlights the fact that they are not just some kind of neutral technology. They are programmed by human beings and they have all the failings of human beings." It's difficult to know what happened when an algorithm goes awry because Google, Facebook and other internet companies closely guard how they work, much the way Coca-Cola protects the recipe for its soda. But the growing power that Google and Facebook hold over the flow of information could increase the political pressure for them to be held more accountable, Doctor said. In the meantime, most people remain skeptical about what they read online. Only 4 percent of Americans have a lot of confidence in what they read on social media sites, according to Pew. Local news organizations fared better in Pew Research's survey earlier this year, with 22 percent of Americans saying they trusted the information there.

It also announced there would be no Chrome ad blocker. Actively-used browsers aren't the same as active users, given that many users rely on Chrome on multiple devices, indeed one of the benefits of using Chrome is that it can easily sync between your devices. But however and wherever you look you'll quickly come to the same conclusion - Chrome has become the ubiquitous and dominant browser. On the desktop it has taken share from Microsoft's Internet Explorer and ensured that Edge has a failed to be adopted despite the efforts made in Windows 10. The fact Chrome is pre-installed on every phone running Google's version of Android certainly gives it a head start in the mobile arena and it also has a healthy share of iOS devices. Here's the latest position from StatCounter across PCs, mobile devices and consoles, showing that Chrome has a 51.53% share of the world-wide market   From NetMarketShare, the latest browser stats for smartphones, tablets and consoles are displayed in this pie chart which shows Chrome's share is 54.30%, with Safari having the only other significant slice (25.66%)   Turning attention to the desktop distribution, Chrome has almost the same proportion (54.41%) and it is Internet Explorer, which is the default browser for Windows 7, the dominant desktop OS that is is second place with 25.48%   NetMarketShare's trend chart over the last 12 months shows clearly how Chrome has increased its dominance at the expense of Internet Explorer: We used to comment on how Firebox was doing - but even though it has rallied a little from its low in August it does seem to have become a lost cause. It will be interesting to see if Edge, which is increasing its tiny share ever edges Firefox out of its third rank position. Meanwhile back at the Chrome Dev Summit, Darin Fisher, vice president of Chrome engineering, told delegates that Google will not be building an ad-blocking feature into Chrome, explaining that it's better to change the behavior of adds rather than block them altogether, a viewpoint undoubtedly motivated by the fact that Google makes a lot of revenue from advertising. Fisher said:  "We feel like there are a lot of challenges in advertising. There are a lot of wrong ways. However, if publishers and advertisers do ads the right way, it can be great for the users and for the ecosystem." Admitting that a lot of advertising hurts engagement by actually deterring people from using websites he referred to a recent initiative, the Coalition for Better Ads that Google has helped to found along with publishers like Facebook, News Corp. and The Washington Post, advertisers like Unilever and Proctor & Gamble, and industry groups like the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) and the Association of National Advertisers (ANA). Fisher also outlined Google's plans to to have Chrome support progressive web apps (PWAs) that deliver a mobile app-like experience within browsers:   "It's expensive to get people to install an app ... but progressive web apps arrive fast through the browser to keep visitors happy, then download extra abilities silently in the background. For website developers there's really no fundamental limit to the kinds of experiences you can create." Firefox and Edge also support PWAs but they are not yet supported by Apple either within Safari or for third-party browsers running on iOS. A lot of attention was paid during the summit to the need for websites to be mobile-friendly, particularly in view of the finding by StatCounter Global Stats that  mobile and tablet devices accounted for 51.3% of Internet usage worldwide in October compared to 48.7% by desktop.     Together with the fact that the Google search algorithm now penalizes web pages that are not mobile-friendly, this is a clear signal  to  web developers not to ignore mobile.        More Information StatCounter Global Stats Netmarketshare Coalition for Better Ads Related Articles Is Chrome Most Prevalent Browser?

This brings much more intelligence to the search giant’s music streaming service and grants users a new UI to gander at while interacting with either the Android, iOS, or web app. Starting with the new intelligence in Play Music, Google has built in the same kind of machine learning featured in their other products based on personalized recommendations. This means that based on your listening habits, Google will begin recommending songs, albums, artists, playlists, radio stations, and more right on the main page for quick access. You’ll also receive recommendations for music you like to listen to at certain times or at certain locations. Of course, recommendations have already been done before in Play Music, but this kind of machine learning is much more powerful. Therefore, Google will be able to predict songs and albums you may wanna listen to rather just suggesting them. The company explains this feature more in-depth below. To provide even richer music recommendations based on Google’s understanding of your world, we’ve plugged into the contextual tools that power Google products. When you opt in, we’ll deliver personalized music based on where you are and why you are listening — relaxing at home, powering through at work, commuting, flying, exploring new cities, heading out on the town, and everything in between. Your workout music is front and center as you walk into the gym, a sunset soundtrack appears just as the sky goes pink, and tunes for focusing turn up at the library. In addition, alongside the new UI and search bar, Google has also built in a feature into the native Play Music apps where if you’re a subscriber to Play Music and plug in your phone, Google will download music for later based on songs and artists you’ve previously listened to. There’s no telling how accurate and useful this feature will be, but you may wanna turn it off anyway if you’re currently running out of space on your device. All in all, this is a great revitalization of Play Music. By implementing the tools discussed here, it looks like Google really does have a worthy competitor to Apple Music and Spotify who have been using machine learning for quite some time now. Whether this will be enough for subscribers to either switch from another service or simply choose Google over everyone else is beyond me, but time will eventually tell if the search giant can really make it in the music streaming business. You can download the free Play Music app for Android and iOS from the Play Store and App Store, respectively. The update will begin rolling out this week to all 62 countries where Play Music is available. You can also visit the official web player for the music streaming service here.

Jump to navigation You are here Home Revamped Google Play Music offers song suggestions based on location and more Submitted by Jennifer Nguyen on Mon, 11/14/2016 - 12:34 Google has revamped its music streaming service with a new contextually aware song recommendation service. The new Google Play Music utilizes "machine learning" to figure out what type of music you like, then mixes that music based on location, activity, and even the weather. The new song recommendation service is available through Google Play Music on the web or through its iOS and Android apps. Google says its revamped music service is "smarter, easier to use, and much more assistive" thanks to its contextual tools that powers most Google products. The Google Play Music app features a redesigned home screen that promises to deliver the right music for you current mood to the top of your display. The app selects the appropriate songs or playlist based on your past listening history. Google describes its new service as the "ultimate personal DJ" who not only knows your favorite type of music, but also knows when you want to listen to certain tracks. This includes suggesting your favorite after work playlist on your drive home, or queuing up that new artist you have just discovered. The app also now supplies subscribers with an offline playlist based on their previous listening history. This allows users to access their favorite songs even when they are stuck with an unreliable or no connection. Google Play Music version 3.14.1007 is available now as a free OTA update. The app is also available for free on the Apple App Store for new users. A paid subscription is required to access all of the app's advanced features. Google Play Music supports all devices running iOS 8.2 or later.

By Jason Cipriani | November 14, 2016 -- 15:39 GMT (07:39 PST) | Topic: Google Image: Google Google Play Music is about to creep you out. Google announced an updated iOS, Android, and website for its streaming music service on Nov. 14. The update is already available on the web and iOS, with the Android version expected to follow suit later in the day. Along with a fresh coat of paint, Google Play Music is now smarter. What's Hot on ZDNet Microsoft to replace security bulletin index with database-driven portal High performance computing (HPC): A look at what's next with TACC's Dan Stanzione If you want a MacBook Pro with a Touch Bar, you have to wait until Christmas Researchers claim quantum computing breakthrough, explain it using beer According to Google's announcement, the new Play Music service uses your location, activity, and local weather. It combines that information with curated playlists, then performs a few fancy calculations, and spits out personalized playlists. For example, over time, Play Music will learn when you're in an airport, or when you typically listen to a certain style of music, and it'll create a travel playlist when it detects you're at an airport. The same will occur when you're at home, at the office, and -- of course -- the gym. Tailoring a playlist based on the small nuances of each user's day has big potential to attract new users and keep current users, if Google can get it right. To show off Play Music's new brain, Google redesigned its home screen. When you launch the app or visit the website, you will now see a series of cards recommending new albums or playlists. Users can sign up for a free, ad-supported Google Play Music account. For those who want to ditch ads and gain the option to download music for offline listening, a Play Music account starts at $9.99 per month for an individual account or $14.99 a month for a family account.

Google Play Music gets prettier and more intelligent Engadget 1 day ago Matt Brian © Provided by Engadget It's long overdue but Google Play Music is getting a makeover. The search giant confirmed today that it is in the process of updating its Android, iOS and Web offerings with bright new UI that relies on machine learning to deliver what's relevant to you. Its AI-like algorithms will identify where you are and what you're doing, also factoring in things like the weather, to serve up playlists and track recommendations that you didn't know you wanted but capture your mood at the time. "When you opt in, we'll deliver personalized music based on where you are and why you are listening — relaxing at home, powering through at work, commuting, flying, exploring new cities, heading out on the town, and everything in between," Google says in a blog post. "Your workout music is front and center as you walk into the gym, a sunset soundtrack appears just as the sky goes pink, and tunes for focusing turn up at the library."

Listen to new releases on Friday? Then it'll serve them up. The same goes for upbeat tunes just as you leave work or a collection of tracks from that new artist you've just discovered but haven't had time to catch up on. Google Play Music has also been given a useful feature that determines when you're without connectivity and automatically delivers an offline playlist based on what you've recently listened to. Play Music is another example of Google using machine learning to improve its services. For a number of years, the company has steadily improved its algorithms to identify, index and caption photos and more recently purge your Gmail inbox of spam. With Spotify pushing personalized playlists via its 'Just For You' weekly playlist (as well as Discover Weekly) and Apple highlighting its 'For You' section, Google is treading a similar path but can call upon years of experience to deliver a streaming service that it says is "smarter, easier to use, and much more assistive." The new features will roll out gradually this week in the 62 countries in which Play Music is available.

Now, the company wants to put some of that knowledge to use to improve music recommendations: Google relaunched its Google Play Music service with a focus on context-relevant content recommendations Monday. The new version will roll out to all users across Android, iOS and the web this week. “Google Play Music uses machine learning to figure out what music you like and then mixes in signals like location, activity, and the weather along with hand-picked playlists to personalize music for wherever you are and whenever you want tunes,” explained lead product manager Elias Roman in a blog post Monday. Users who opt into using Google data to power their music recommendations will get song suggestions based on the place they’re listening, their current activity and even the weather. “Your workout music is front and center as you walk into the gym, a sunset soundtrack appears just as the sky goes pink, and tunes for focusing turn up at the library,” Roman wrote. In addition to the new content recommendations, Google Play Music is also getting a new look, as well as improved offline listening: Instead of asking users to download their favorite albums beforehand, Google Play Music’s new mobile apps do this automatically based on past listening — a feature that’s similar to the way Pandora’s new $5 tier caches music for offline listening. Google has yet to release subscriber numbers for Google Play Music, but it’s widely assumed that the service trails more popular competitors like Spotify and Apple Music by a wide margin. That’s in part because there has been little to differentiate the service from its bigger competitors. Using context-relevant content recommendations could be a first step to more clearly define what Google Play Music is all about.

Under that, Google lists some related news articles. At the top this morning, with an accompanying photo: a story arguing that Donald Trump won both the popular and electoral votes. Photo by: THE WASHINGTON POST That’s not true. The Daily Show’s Dan Amira noticed that numbers were being spread on social media that linked back to the “70 News” site. The 70 News article cites its source as a tweet, which cites as its source USASupreme.com, another random website which doesn’t actually include the numbers themselves. It does, however, argue that Hillary Clinton is “probably not going to win the actual number of votes cast. She may win the number of votes counted, but not the votes cast.” That distinction is … not really clear, except that the author, “Alex,” seems to believe that absentee ballots are only counted if the tally could make the difference in the election. That’s not true, either. In light gray text above the link to 70 News, Google relays the actual current tally of counted votes: Clinton has a lead of about 700,000. That lead has grown since Election Day and will almost certainly continue to grow, since millions of the votes being counted are from California, and the plurality of those votes are from very-Clinton-friendly Los Angeles County. The source behind the “USA Supreme” website isn’t clear. It looks an awful lot like Prntly, a made-up news website we looked at earlier this year. Founded by a former convict named Alex Portelli, Prntly is part of the broad diaspora of websites that takes news about American politics, frames it in a pro-Trump way (often at the expense of accuracy) and then peppers the page with ads. In an email, Portelli denied involvement in USA Supreme, suggesting that it was the work of a group of young people in Macedonia first reported by BuzzFeed. These sites leverage the inability of Facebook and other social media sites to weed out nonsense in order to get clicks and make money from advertising — a remarkably lucrative endeavor, particularly in a country where the U.S. dollar stretches a lot further. Why Google includes 70 News as a news source isn’t clear. Among the main categories of news stories the site lists in its header is “Hillary’s Health,” which links to a number of rumors about the health of the Democratic nominee. Under “Politics” is a story that, among other things, links the Council on American-Islamic Relations to Al Qaeda. Another story suggests that protestors against Trump in California were being paid to do so. 70 News has added a header to its post about the election results. “Anyone asking where I got the figures, it was from twitter posts. Knowing the Democrat media have been dragging their liberal feet giving Michigan to Trump – finally they did, with Arizona finally declared two days ago – Trump now has the 309. Except for the twitter posts, the popular vote number still need to be updated in Wikipedia or MSM media – which may take another few days because the liberals are still reeling and recovering from Trump-shock victory. If I’m wrong, I won’t hesitate to change the numbers. It’s the job of the establishment media to tell the people the final numbers when it’s out there already.” None of that is true, either. The “establishment media” has regularly updated election results, showing Clinton with a wide popular vote lead. The reason that Michigan hasn’t been called is that Trump’s lead is 12,000 votes, and the results haven’t been finalized. New Hampshire also hasn’t been called for Clinton; her lead there is under 3,000 votes. “Alex” is wrong; he’s hesitating to change the numbers. If you’re interested in tracking the final vote tallies in the presidential race, you can simply search Google and keep an eye out for the small print under the electoral college totals. If you also see an article from a random site you’ve never heard of? I might recommend you take its numbers with a grain of salt.

Googles how to build igloos, roll joints most of any state ESTATELY ASSEMBLED a list of the how-to questions that each state Googles more frequently than any other state. COURTESY ESTATELY Print Email Comment Tweet Posted: Monday, November 14, 2016 12:42 pm By Lori Stabile PBN Web Editor Twitter: @loristabile retail Finder.com: Rhode Islanders plan to spend $52 on Valentine’s Day gifts (Feb. 12, 2016) economic indicators WalletHub names best small cities in U.S., Warwick ranks highest in R.I. (Oct. 31, 2016) economic indicators R.I. drops to 42nd in ‘State of the States’ report (Oct. 26, 2016) PROVIDENCE – Curious what “how to” questions Rhode Islanders Google more than any other state? They may or may not surprise you: How to build an igloo, how to roll a joint, how to make money selling drugs and how to do screenshots on Macs and PCs. Courtesy of Estately, a real estate website, Americans now know what residents in the United States are Googling – and they run the gamut from the practical (Alabama – how to install laminate flooring and North Dakota – how to get a passport) to bizarre and well, unbelievable (Nevada – how to survive a zombie apocalypse and California – how to be invisible, how to teleport). “When Americans don’t know how to do something, they won’t rest until they’ve figured it out, usually through the power of Google searches,” wrote Estately, which said what it uncovered was both surprising and “extremely predictable.” <a href="http://adserver.pbn.com/servlet/click/zone?zid=1&pid=0&lookup=true&position=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> <img src="http://adserver.pbn.com/servlet/view/banner/image/zone?zid=1&pid=0&position=1" height="60" width="468" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Click Here!"> </a> It used Google Autocomplete to compile hundreds of common how-to questions Americans type into the Google search bar, then ran the searches through Google Trends to determine which state queried each of the selected phrases the most over the past five years. Estately said the phrases do not represent what each state Googles the most, rather what each state Googles more frequently than the other 49 states and the District of Columbia. Here are some highlights: Arizona: How to join the Illuminati? Arkansas: How to make money? Connecticut: How to be pretty? Delaware: How to get away with murder? Florida: How to change the world? How to get out of Florida? Georgia: How to make meth? Hawaii: How to be a ninja? Kansas: How to find Kansas? Massachusetts and Minnesota: How to quit your job? Mississippi: How to twerk? New Hampshire: How to tip cows? New Jersey: How to get ripped? How to stop Trump? Vermont: How to cook quinoa? (tie with Idaho) More “how to” questions from each state can be found at Estately.com.

Email Password Remember me Forgot password?     Log in with Facebook Log in with Twitter Log In news tech & science social media business entertainment life sports     Google now has its own fake news problem Listen | Print By James Walker     yesterday in Technology In the days after the Presidential election, Facebook was accused of aiding Trump by helping to spread false news. It has emerged that Google is also displaying fake headlines. The company is investigating an inaccurate report promoted in search. Users searching for "final election numbers" on Google could be in for a surprise. As first reported by Mediaite, Google's top source in the search results links to a WordPress blog called 70news. The poorly built site is unlikely to be what users are looking for but Google is currently promoting it above all else. The title of the article that makes it to Google's top spot ends with "Hey Change.org, scrap your loony petition now!" The article claims to provide the final election results, suggesting Trump won the popular vote by a margin of 700,000 votes. Clinton is currently leading by around 668,000, a figure that some think may rise to two million. Google promoting a fake news article to the top of its news results James Walker The 70news report cites "twitter posts" (no capitalisation) as the source of the figures. The author, writing in the first person, pledged "I won't hesitate to change the numbers" if it turns out the figures are wrong. The site said "It's the job of the establishment media to tell the people the final numbers when it's out there already." There isn't a lot to suggest 70news is an authentic news site deserving a place at the top of Google. It's using a free ".wordpress.com" domain, hasn't changed its icon and includes "Hillary's Health" amongst its primary navigation topics. Combined with its fake headlines, it seems unthinkable that the blog has made it to the very top of Google's news cards. Other reports on the website include a "politics" story linking the U.S. Council on American-Islamic Relations to terrorist group Al-Qaeda. 70news' article on the popular vote appears in other areas of Google's election coverage, including its new digital assistant Google Assistant. Searching for similar terms, including "final popular vote," delivers the same result. An unassuming user who doesn't frequently read news online could be convinced that 70news' coverage is genuine. Google presents its news box as a place to quickly find out what's happening in the headlines. People neither expect or want to see links to poorly written personal blogs that have little relevance to the news. The lack of any generally well-regarded sites in the top three results suggests Google's algorithm has had trouble prioritising the wealth of stories covering the U.S. election. The company has not yet commented on the placement of 70news' post within its news widget. It remains unclear why the site has been categorised as a reputable news provider, considering its inaccurate, opinionated nature. At the time of writing, the headline is still the top result when searching for the final result of the election, accompanied by stories about 70news' presence in Google News.

By Jack Wallen | November 14, 2016, 8:55 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Jack Wallen If you have a Linux printer server, and you need to enable users to be able to print to your cloud-based printers, one easy method is to attach CUPS to a Google Account for use with Google Cloud Print. Great solution, right? But how do you pull that off? Must-Read Cloud Why there's no compelling use case for hybrid cloud Pokemon Go: How the cloud saved the smash hit game from collapse Switching clouds: What Spotify learned when it swapped AWS for Google's cloud Tech Pro Research: Cloud computing policy Someone in the Linux community has made it not only possible, but easy. Let me walk you through the steps of connecting your CUPS printer server to a Google Cloud Print account. I will be doing this on a Ubuntu 16.10 machine. The necessary software is available for Ubuntu as well as rpm-based distributions, Arch Linux, Gentoo, Portage ebuild, OS X, FreeBSD, and more. Installation The first thing you must do is install the necessary package. To do this, we must add a repository. Open your terminal window and issue the command: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:simon-cadman/niftyrepo Now, update apt with the command: sudo apt-get update Finally, install the software with the command: sudo apt-get install cupscloudprint Once the installation is ready, you can connect your server to the Google Cloud Print account.

The search giant has announced it is now rolling out an updated version of Google Play Music in all 62 countries where the platform is available, which is to say Canadians will be able to check out the new app sometime this week. Besides featuring a fresh new design, the app is the latest Google service to take advantage of the company’s work in machine learning. Each time the user launches the app, Google Play Music will populate the home screen with new playlists relevant to their music interests and what they’re currently doing. “When you opt in, we’ll deliver personalized music based on where you are and why you are listening — relaxing at home, powering through at work, commuting, flying, exploring new cities, heading out on the town, and everything in between,” says Elias Roman, lead product manager for Google Play Music. “Your workout music is front and center as you walk into the gym, a sunset soundtrack appears just as the sky goes pink, and tunes for focusing turn up at the library.” In launching this new playlist-focused version of Google Play Music, Google is playing catch-up to Spotify. Since launch, the latter’s Discover Weekly and Just For You playlists have become a major hit, and while they do have a machine learning component to them, Spotify has said multiple times that it is its human music experts that help make them special. It will be interesting to see if Google can do the same with just algorithms. Google Play Music is available on Android, iOS and desktop.

I had been doing this because Search Results at Google and at Bing have started showing off information about businesses and site that includes knowledge panel information and richer snippets. I thought it made sense to capture information that Google might be showing off that represented sites, and provide some recommendations that might help improve how those looked at what kind of information they contained. The presentation is: Knowledge Panels, Rich Snippets and Semantic Markup from Bill Slawski Knowledge panels may be enhanced because of a verified Google MyBusiness listing, a Wikipedia Entry, a Freebase Entry (now terminated by Google), a Wikidata Entry. This Google Developers page provides more details: https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/enhance-site Adding Markup vocabulary on your site can result in a knowledge panel showing links to social profiles for a business, as described here: https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/social-profile-links A knowledge panel based upon a Google MyBusiness listing can show off Reviews that people have submitted to Google+ for a site, “Reviews from the Web” from sources such as Facebook, Tripadvisor, Consumer Affairs, and others; and may also show off critical reviews. If there are enough reviews from Google+, the knowledge panel may also show off sentiment rich snippets from those reviews as well. Search results are a lot more colorful and richer these days, and Knowing how to make your business and site stand out may bring you more traffic and customers as you are represented better in search results.

Its nice to see the SERP are really improving like reviews, and structured menus are already included. Nice share. David says: 10/20/2016 at 11:44 pm Very interesting read Bill. Thank you for sharing the presentation. I’ve highlighted sitselinks and rich snippets in client reports before, but I’ve not gone to the depths that you’ve gone to. It’s given me more food for thought. That is for sure. Thanks again. jay key says: 10/21/2016 at 2:58 am Hi Bill, Very helpful suggestions that help in the optimizing website. Thank you for valuable suggestions. Bill Slawski says: 10/21/2016 at 7:59 am Hi Jay, You’re welcome. I’ve been enjoying reviewing how sitelinks, and knowledge panels and structured data impacts sites. It is an area that Google has been making a lot of changes to recently as well. It’s nice keeping an eye on these changes and addressing them. 🙂 Andy Kuiper says: 10/21/2016 at 12:57 pm I enjoyed the sessions… as always – thanks Bill 🙂 Bill Slawski says: 10/21/2016 at 4:15 pm Hi Andy, You’re welcome. Good to hear that you enjoyed the presentations. I should have given thanks to Carrie Hall who provided a lot of details on how local businesses get value from Knowledge panels, and who included some great tidbits of information about Schema. Andy Kuiper says: 10/21/2016 at 4:34 pm 🙂 Alnoor Verjee says: 10/22/2016 at 9:34 am Hi Bill, interesting information. I just wanted to ask you whether it’s ok to add star rating snippets from a google my business page onto a page you would like to rank so that it looks eye catching in the SERPS? So basically the page will have schema code showing the stars which will link to the GMB page. I’ve seen some websites do this but just wanted to ask whether you think it’s sustainable in the long-term? Richart Ruddie says: 10/22/2016 at 3:40 pm As always Bill excellent analysis and great presentation showing the evolution through the years. Why do you think Google killed Freebase and do you believe there is a ratio for the knowledge panel to start displaying review snippets? Suresh Kumar says: 10/23/2016 at 2:03 am Hello Suresh Here Thank you for posting this article i am enjoying to read it . Ya it’s sure sitelink, knowledge panels and structured data always impacts sites. Abir says: 10/23/2016 at 3:20 am Hi Bill! very informative post. I will use the suggestions discussing here for optimizing my new blog site.This post will be very helpful for the begaineer SEO worker who are new in this field. Keep posting this type of helpful post. With best wishes Abir Dutta Allen Farrish says: 10/23/2016 at 7:55 am Thanks for the always useful information. This is great information to help garage type SEO people like me. Bill Slawski says: 10/23/2016 at 3:35 pm Hi Allen There aren’t any official places for people to learn about SEO, so if we have opportunities to help each other learn new things, we should take them. Bill Slawski says: 10/23/2016 at 3:37 pm Hi Abir, Good hearing that you have learned some new things here for optimizing your site. I hope that others learn from it as well. I will keep trying to post helpful things. Bill Slawski says: 10/23/2016 at 3:41 pm Hi Suresh, Search Results have changed in the past few years; and I tried to focus upon newer features that I hadn’t seen much about in Site Audits that people have been writing about or that I’ve been doing, and tried to carry these features over to my audits and my presentation. Bill Slawski says: 10/23/2016 at 3:56 pm Hi Richard, Thank you. Freebase appears to have been replaced by a volunteer effort known as Wikidata. If you haven’t had a chance to see it or spend any time with it; it’s worth learning about. There does seem to be a required number of Google+ reviews before Google will start showing review snippets in a knowledge panel. It’s another of those things that have been changing over time. For a while, Google was showing 3 snippets in the knowledge panel for SEO by the Sea from 3 Reviews; and then they stopped. Then I got another review, and they started showing 3 snippets again. And then they stopped. I have seen one site with 7 reviews that shows 3 snippets. I’m not sure of the exact required threshold to start showing snippets, or if it will change, like it has for me in the past. Bill Slawski says: 10/23/2016 at 4:10 pm Hi Alnoor, I don’t think Google wants people to add schema markup to their pages that show reviews or ratings that were submitted to a Google+ page. Google will show numbers of ratings and rating scores from Google+ in a knowledge panel for that site, so they have already found a way to display that information. Some other options that might be worth considering are available through this site started in part by Mike Blumenthal: https://www.getfivestars.com/ Caroline Middlebrook says: 10/24/2016 at 2:45 am Thanks for posting the slides Bill, it’s a great presentation, and something I need to learn more about.

Bill Slawski says: 10/24/2016 at 1:37 pm Hi Caroline, Happy to hear that you enjoyed my presentation. Madhushalini says: 10/25/2016 at 9:52 pm I am very grateful for this enlightening article. I am new to this issue, but for me it elucidated several questions. Congratulations on your knowledge on the subject. Thank you very much. Allen says: 10/26/2016 at 11:26 am One basic question. Should I put the sameas links on every page or just the home page? Bill Slawski says: 10/26/2016 at 12:38 pm Hi Allen, The developer’s page from Google that tells us about the sameas links to social profiles can be found here: https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/social-profile-links It doesn’t specify (though it probably should) that those links just need to be on one page. Putting them on your homepage should be sufficient, as opposed to all pages of the site. Aymen Loukil says: 10/30/2016 at 9:33 am Good slides about entities and Knowledge Graph Bill 😉 I have developed this website to query the KG API of Google : http://knowledge-graph.fr Bill Slawski says: 10/30/2016 at 10:18 am Hi Aymen, Thank you. I wanted to show people how I was including a look at entities and the knowledge graph in an audit. It has become a part of how I do audits now. I’ve seen a few people point me towards your website to show off knowledge graph results. I do like how it looks. Rocky Murasing says: 11/01/2016 at 12:04 am Hello Mr. Bill I see you have comprehensively put a huge info in such a short blog. This must be beneficial for website optimization. I appreciate your work. Dhaval Parmar says: 11/02/2016 at 1:47 am Hi Bill, interesting information. ashok says: 11/02/2016 at 3:29 am your article gave some good point to seo beginners thanks for sharing your knowledge… Mark says: 11/05/2016 at 8:50 am I would agree the snipet panels or search query info boxes are killing it. They are huge and always at the top of the searches. It’s a huge advantage for your SEO campaign. Thanks Bill, great content. Bill Slawski says: 11/05/2016 at 11:34 am Hi Mark, Thanks. We’ve been seeing people increasingly refer to those answer boxes at the top of search results as being in “Position zero.” It is a nice place to be, especially in mobile results. If you can capture people’s attention, and persuade them to come visit your pages at the start of a search, it is a matter of being at the right place, at the right time. Jeff says: 11/05/2016 at 3:40 pm Hi Bill, Thank you for valuable information and thank you for sharing knowledge. Bill Slawski says: 11/05/2016 at 9:05 pm Hi Jeff, You’re welcome. These do seem like moves that are worth learning about. jese says: 11/10/2016 at 9:44 pm So interesting article. And great tips in there. Thanks for sharing.

Strategy Analytics Nov 14, 2016, 12:00 ET Share this article BOSTON, Nov. 14, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- The increased reliance on mobile LBS continues to be fueled by mobility apps which enable taxi-hailing, car-sharing, and car-pooling, in addition to the integration of multimodal routing in popular mobile map applications like Apple Maps, Google Maps and HERE WeGo, according to Strategy Analytics' Wireless Media Strategies (WMS) report "Mobile LBS: Status Check & Platform Assessment." In emerging markets the growth of mobile LBS is being boosted by a growing penetration of GPS on lower priced handset tiers. Furthermore, for the third year running, location platform HERE has come top in Strategy Analytics' location platform benchmark study, and is placed well for future growth opportunities as the mobile location services market continues to evolve. Click here for the report:  http://sa-link.cc/MobileLBS Continue Reading Photo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161114/438754 Rising adoption of smartphone-centric mobility apps, including Uber, Lyft, and Didi, among others, and the meteoric rise of the location-based augmented reality game, Pokémon Go, have provided a welcome boost to the mobile LBS sector during 2016. Nitesh Patel, Director, Strategy Analytics noted "Mobile location services are benefitting from the shift in demand for urban transport towards on-demand, mobile-centric services, where the smartphone plays an increasingly important role for both journey planning and the administration of these services. Ride-hailing and car-sharing will be further boosted by their integration into major mobile journey planning applications, such as Apple Maps, Google Maps and HERE WeGo, which are evolving into one-stop-shops for journey planning and support."   The report assesses the strengths and weaknesses of global LBS players, Apple, Google, HERE, and TomTom, across eight important metrics, including map and navigation coverage, indoor venue capabilities, reach across major mobile device platforms, map data visualization, in-vehicle connectivity, offline usage, local search and crowd sourcing. The race to provide the most fresh, up-to-date and accurate maps in real-time is being driven by a combination of the trend towards autonomous driving, and greater consumer dependence on smartphones for journey planning and execution in outdoor, and increasingly indoor environments. David Kerr, Senior Vice President at Strategy Analytics, noted "For the third year in the row HERE has maintained its leadership in mapping and location capabilities, followed by Google, TomTom and then Apple. HERE's ownership by car-makers enables it to leverage its strength in the automotive industry across all digital platforms, including mobile. Google maintains its leadership in business –to-consumer (B2C) LBS applications, as it benefits from preloading on most Android handsets, and is the most widely used map, navigation and local search app. Both Apple and TomTom remain in catch-up mode with TomTom aiming to improve its support of multi-modal routing and navigation, including ramping its coverage of indoor venues in 2017."

The new GPM leans heavily on machine learning to get a read on your musical likes, and then "mixes in signals like location, activity, and the weather" along with hand-curated playlists. Contextual tools that power and individualize other Google products are being utilized to help provide "richer" recommendations. "When you opt in, we’ll deliver personalized music based on where you are and why you are listening," said lead product manager Elias Roman on the Google blog. The new Google Play Music also creates offline playlists for you, based on your listening history, meaning there will always be tracks on your phone even if you lose cell service. A new home screen reflects on your listening habits as well, so if you’re someone who hits the gym most mornings, a workout playlist may appear. Ditto for users who religiously visit the app on Fridays for new music or who rock out on drives home from work. "Powered by Google's machine learning systems and honed by our team of expert music curators, your experience will keep evolving (and improving) as we get to know you better." Introducing a fresher take on music streaming —one that's smarter, easier to use, and much more assistive. https://t.co/CUODx4ZIMa pic.twitter.com/JHgCkp40Tb— Google Play Music (@GooglePlayMusic) November 14, 2016 FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Comments Magazine Customer Service Subscribe Buy this issue Billboard biz The online extension of Billboard Magazine, billboard.biz is the essential online destination for the music business.

Every time we type something into that thin white bar, it’s learning from us, and noting down what it learns for all of time to come. Sinister, yes – but also useful. Take, for example, the stereotypes of our fair isles. Have you ever wondered what the internet thinks of the people of Herefordshire, or what being from Cumbria really signifies for the www dot generation? Using the power of Google autocomplete, we’ve constructed a map out of the most popular related search terms for each county in the UK. Some of them are as you’d expect – others? Well, they can get a bit weird. You can see a more detailed breakdown of the results below – if it isn’t there, it means people probably aren’t searching it. The South Bedfordshire Most people are asking the age old questions: “Is Bedfordshire in London?”; “Is Luton safe?”; “Is Bedford happy?” Berkshire People talking about Berkshire seem to think Windsor is “in London,” Maidenhead is “a dump,” Hungerford is “flooded” and Eton is, perhaps unsurprisingly, “a posh one.” Buckinghamshire People of Buckinghamshire, rejoice: not only are you “posh,” you’re also “the best county” and – apperently – “the new Hollywood!” Beaconsfield isn’t so lucky, though – apparently it’s “jinxed.” Bristol “Bristol is open,” and Bristol is also “the new black.” You’re also “the green capital,” apparently, so good for you. Cambridgeshire Not that there’s a rivaly, but Cambridge is apparently “better than Oxford” – it’s “beautiful,” too. Cornwall People are confused by Cornwall, tending to ask Google “Why is it good for surfing?” and declaring that the county is “not England.” St Ives is apparently “bad for your skin,” while Newquay and Penzance are both “a dump.” Devon  The top search term for Devon is “better than Cornwall,” obviously. On a more local level, people declare Exeter “posh,” Torquay “rough” and “hilly” and Dartmoor as “dangerous” and “haunted.” Dorset  People most often describe Dorset as “beautiful,” although they spend as much time asking if it’s in Devon, Cornwall or Kent. Queries include asking if Bournemouth is “nice” or even “sandy,” if Weymouth is “dog friendly,” and if Gillingham is “safe,” “rough” or “in London.” Essex Essex takes a battering online: it’s “just crap,” according to one of the top search results. Frequantly asked questions include “Why is Essex so rich?”, “Why is Essex so famous?”, and “Why is Essex so bad?” Colchester is apparently “vulgar and debased,” but Billericay is “posh.” Gloucestershire Sorry to break it to you, but no-one searches for Gloucestershire – even the top results for Cheltenham and Cirencester tend to be the baffled “Where?” and “Which county?” Greater London Unsurprisingly, there’s a plethora of search terms for London. “Dirty” and “lonely” come out top, although people are also obsessed with it being “hot” and “humid” – and, of course, “expensive.” On a closer level, Shoreditch and Dalston are both “dead,” but Peckham is both “the new Shoreditch” and “the new Dalston.” The City of London is “not part of England,” West London is “wonderful” and, unfortunately, South London is “bad.” Hertfordshire “Posh.” Obviously. Did you need to ask? Isle of Wight It’s both “rockin” and “a ghetto,” so take of that what you will. Kent Blame Farage, but Kent is declared “racist.” And “boring.” Hey, at least Margate is “cool.” Norfolk “Inbred.” Oxfordshire Sure, it’s “posh,” but it’s also “overrated.” Oxford itself is an “expensive dump,” while Bicester is “cheap” and, apparently, “on fire.” Also, people really want to know when an Aldi is opening in didcot. Suffolk Hey, apparently Suffolk “is the best place to live.” You go guys. Surrey  All the Surrey stereotypes ring true online: “Conservative,” “posh,” “expensive” and… “dangerous”? Sussex “Split” is the most-searched term, meaning people are understandably confused what went wrong between the East and the West. The Midlands Derbyshire “Derbyshire is a hotbed of Satanism.” Herefordshire Most people are confused whether Herefordshire is in Wales or not. Is it!? Leicestershire Leicester is “on fire,” apparently, and not just because they were “top of the league.” People are also pretty obsessed with finding out whether it’s “East of Norwich,” strangely. Lincolnshire “So flat,” “so cheap,” and apparently so boring. Northamptonshire “Northampton is my fate,” declare the Google search terms. Nottinghamshire The top result is genuinely “Nottinghamshire is in which country?”, while the consensus around Nottingham itself is that it’s both “rough” and “the Queen of the Midlands.” Rutland “Where?” Shropshire Like Herefordshire, people just really want to know if it’s in Wales or not. Staffordshire “The creative county.” Now you know. Warwickshire “Which country is Warwickshire in?”; “Is Warwickshire a city?”; “Is Warwickshire near Birmingham?” – all questions the internet is dying to know the answer to. West Midlands Brummies are: “thick,” “brilliant,” “friendly” and, apparently, “the UK’s randiest.” Worcestershire Sorry to break it to you, but people only care about the sauce. The North Cheshire “Posh,” “affluent” and “wealthy.” Cumbria The weirdly specific search terms about Cumbria are that it’s “the safest place to live,” that it’s “wet,” and that it’s “good for windfarms.” Greater Manchester “Important.” Unlike Mancunians to blow their own horn. Lancashire Keeping the age-old rivalry alive, Lancashire is declared “better than Yorkshire.” It’s also “wonderful,” not to mention “famous.” Merseyside There’s a real dichotomy when it comes to Liverpool – half of the results declare it a “dump” full of “thieves,” while the other half say it’s “the pool of life” and “a great city.” Scousers? Well, apparently they’re “annoying” – we apologise on Google’s behalf. Northumberland “Is Northumberland in Scotland?” I guess we’ll never really know. Tyne and Wear Google isn’t kind to Geordies, either. Search “Geordies are,” and the first four results you’ll get are (in order): “thick,” “scum,” “Scottish” and (luckily) “the best.” Yorkshire Yorkshire is “big,” so it’s no surprising it heralds a lot of results. These include “a state of mind,” “God’s own country” and “the best.” Bradford is apparently “very inbred,” though, and if you type “we all hate” into the whole of Google the first result you’ll get is “Leeds scum.” Charming. Scotland Autocompleted Google results are actually much sparser in Scotland, mainly because most of them finish with either “is in Scotland,” “is in the Highlands,” or “is where?” – much like with Dumfries & Gallowayand Kincardineshire. However there are some more quirky queries online: Aberdeenshire is a “paradise” and Ayrshire is a “nice place,” while Stirlingshire is “important” and Banffshire is “expensive.” Up top, things get a little bit more confusing. People seem to only associate Moray with its slippery namesake, while questions ask range from “Is Bute a Scrabble word?” to “Are The Highlands dangerous?” And “Is Orkney the new Ibiza?”, obviously. Wales and Northern Ireland Wales and Northern Ireland are both defined online by general confusion. In the latter, they ask if Pembrokeshire is “nice,” if Powys is a city, is Caernarvonshire and Merioneth are “haunted” and if Montgomeryshire is even in Wales after all. The search terms to do with the cities are a bit clearer, though, if not a little mismatched: Cardiff is “booming,” while Swansea is “the graveyard of ambition.” Over the sea in NI, most of the questions are about whether places are in the UK or not – although there are a few exceptions. Fermanagh, for example, is “happy;” Derry/Londonderry may or may not be “safe.” Antrim? Well, that’s the name of someone’s stepdad. @thebobpalmer Share on Facebook The UK’s worst hometowns, according to Google The most heartbreaking tweets from women who can’t believe Trump is president Here’s the best dressed people on campus this week The 10 jobs with the biggest bonuses No, that Simpsons picture didn’t predict Trump’s presidency Who actually is Melania Trump?

Google’s self-driving cars are naturals when it comes to three-point turns Posted yesterday by Darrell Etherington (@etherington) 0 SHARES Next Story Lima beefs up its Dropbox alternative with the $129 Lima Ultra Google updates the world monthly on the progress of its self-driving car project, and this month’s update includes the usual stats, like over 2,230,175 miles driven in autonomous mode, as well as an explainer on how the cars handle a tricky task: multi-point turning. The three-point turn is a boilerplate part of any driving test, and one that can prove quite challenging depending on where you’re trying to accomplish one. Google says that its cars have some big advantages over humans when it comes to multi-point turns, like full 360-degree wraparound vision, and extremely accurate distance measurement. As a result, Google has found that its cars could actually do maneuvers that don’t resemble the standard three-point turn but that might be more efficient overall – but that’s not ideal UX when it comes to human passengers. Humans are more comfortable when cars drive in ways that include recognizable behavior, so Google has trained its self-driving fleet not only to execute three-point turns, but to do so in a way that “feels natural” to those on board. The Google test cars do around 1,000 multi-point turns on actual city roads per week, Google says. Google also uses the report to spell out any accidents its test cars are involved in, and they did have one to report from October 26. The self-driving car was traveling at 3 mph when it was tapped from behind by a vehicle going 6 mph, however, making it a minor fender-bender where the human was at fault and damage was minimal. It’s interesting to get a look at how the Google team is building UX into their tech, at the same time as they’re solving difficult technical challenges. Good UX will probably be just as important to long-term user acceptance of autonomous driving tech as will safety issues, so it’s smart to build them hand-in-hand. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe Latest Crunch Report Snapchat Starts Selling Spectacles | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes Artificial Intelligence Popular Posts Featured Stories Microsoft teams up with Elon Musk’s OpenAI project 3 hours ago | Frederic Lardinois Google and Facebook ban fake news sites from their advertising networks 5 hours ago | Romain Dillet WhatsApp launches video calling for everyone 11 hours ago | Josh Constine, Sarah Perez Valuation metrics show weakening for the fourth straight quarter 17 hours ago | Connie Loizos Latest From Gadgets The cameras are coming 17 minutes ago | John Mannes New LIDAR package makes it easier to add smarts to your smart car 1 hour ago | John Biggs Jaguar’s first electric SUV aims for 80% charge in 90 minutes 2 hours ago | Darrell Etherington John Hancock insurance is subsidizing the cost of the new Apple Watch 3 hours ago | Brian Heater Comment moderation powered by Up Next Lima beefs up its Dropbox alternative with the $129 Lima Ultra Posted yesterday CrunchBoard Job Listings Infrastructure Engineer Tango at The Sourcery (Mountain View, CA, United States) Senior Software Engineer @ Pared at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) Software Engineer @ Pared at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) Technical Content Writer @ Pantheon at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) Staff Software Engineer @ Lending Home at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) More from CrunchBoard Advertisement TechCrunch News Video Events Crunchbase TechCrunch Store About Staff Contact Us Advertise With Us Send Us A Tip International China Europe Japan Follow TechCrunch Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Youtube Pinterest Tumblr Instagram StumbleUpon Feed TechCrunch Apps iOS Android Windows 8 Subscribe to The Daily Crunch Latest headlines delivered to you daily Subscribe to <span class="no-mobile">Subscribe to </span>The Daily Crunch Enter Email Address Subscribe © 2013-2016 AOL Inc.

SUBSCRIBE 70% of consumers will leave a review for a business when asked Want to get inside the minds of potential customers for your local business? Columnist Sherry Bonelli shares insights from BrightLocal's annual Local Consumer Review Survey. Sherry Bonelli on November 14, 2016 at 10:03 am More A business’s online reputation is more important than ever. In fact, a company’s online reputation is fast becoming one of their most valuable assets — if managed properly. Why? In a world where online reviews show up virtually every time a person searches for a local business, potential customers can’t help but be confronted with reviews about a local business’s products or services — the good, the bad and (sometimes) the downright ugly. So what impact do these reviews have on people searching for a place to spend their money? BrightLocal’s 2016 Local Consumer Review Survey Every year, BrightLocal (disclosure: my employer) surveys everyday consumers to gauge the sentiment and attitudes they have about the local companies they do business with. The purpose of the survey? To help small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs), digital marketing agencies and SEOs understand how online reviews influence the purchasing decisions consumers make as they search for local companies, products or services. If you (or your clients) have been avoiding the topic of online reviews up until now, I have a feeling you will change your mind after you learn more about how consumers read and act (or don’t act) after evaluating online reviews about businesses. About the 2016 Local Consumer Review Survey The Local Consumer Review Survey is in its sixth year. Over the past several years, there has been a noticeable shift in how consumers search online for local businesses and the importance online reviews play in a consumer’s purchasing process. This year BrightLocal surveyed a US consumer panel made up of 1,000 individuals. The survey questions explore how consumers read and use the reviews they see online. The answers show how businesses and marketers can qualify the value consumers put on online reviews and whether these reviews have any impact on a consumer’s purchasing decisions. Consumers see online reviews almost every time they search More and more these days, consumers are using the internet to find local businesses and see online reviews almost every time they go online to do a local search. Why the increase? Over the past few years, many local businesses have realized the importance of optimizing their online presence for the local market by claiming their Google My Business or Bing Places for Business pages, creating location-specific pages on their website, adding Google Maps to their site and other local SEO strategies. Additionally, Google shows online reviews in many search engine results pages (SERPs), and they even recently started adding third-party review sites and reviews to a business’s Knowledge Panel. Also, because people have access to a variety of devices to perform searches on, such as smartphones and tablets, it’s easy for them to jump online wherever they are and search for reviews about a business, product or service. So, how do consumers read and use the information found in reviews? Let’s find out by looking at some of the survey questions and answers. Which of these business types have you read online reviews for? Note: Respondents were told to select as many answers as needed. Key findings: The most commonly read reviews by consumers are Restaurant/Cafe reviews, with 60 percent of respondents having read reviews for businesses in this category. Hotels/Bed & Breakfasts reviews came in second, with 40 percent of respondents seeking reviews for businesses in this category. Also popular are Medical/Healthcare Professionals, Clothing Shops, Hair/Beauty Salons, Automotive Services and Grocery Stores. Restaurants/Cafes, Hotels/Bed & Breakfasts, Medical/Healthcare Professionals, Clothing Stores, Hair/Beauty Salons, Grocery Stores and Automotive Services are the main businesses that people want to read reviews for. One thing to consider is that these numbers are somewhat dependent on both the type of business and how frequently consumers tend to use that type of business. For instance, business types that people use frequently (like restaurants or grocery stores) will probably have more reviews because more people simply visit these types of businesses more often and on a regular basis. You will probably find fewer reviews for locksmiths, accountants or pest control companies because these services are not needed as often. Even though reviews for some business types are read less often, when one needs those businesses (e.g., you lock yourself out of your house or you see cockroaches in your kitchen), then consumers will actively look at those reviews. Bottom line: every business benefits from having online reviews (no matter the industry). How many online reviews do you read before you feel you can trust a business? Key findings: 90 percent of consumers read just 10 reviews or fewer before they feel that they can trust a business (vs. 87 percent in 2015). 32 percent of consumers form an opinion by reading one to three reviews. 68 percent of consumers form an opinion by reading one to six reviews. Consumers form opinions about a business fast, with 68 percent forming an opinion by reading just one to six reviews. Almost nine out of 10 consumers determine whether they can trust a business after reading 10 or fewer online reviews. To remain relevant, businesses must have a reputation strategy where they monitor what consumers are saying about them and have a way to proactively get positive new reviews from happy customers. Why? When evaluating a business, consumers will typically look at the top reviews first. If the recent reviews are negative ones, they may not read past those bad reviews — even if there are positive reviews right below the negative ones. It’s imperative that businesses generate ongoing positive reviews so that any negative reviews they have are pushed down on the list. Business owners shouldn’t be scared of online reviews, they should see them as an opportunity to engage with their customers and get feedback about their business. How many different review sites (e.g., Yelp, TripAdvisor) do you look at before you make a decision about a business? Key findings: 20 percent of consumers look at one review site before deciding. 59 percent of consumers look at two to three review sites before making a decision. 21 percent of consumers look at four or more review sites before deciding. This new question focuses specifically on how many review sites people go to before they decide about a business. The answers vary depending on the type of business someone is researching. For instance, if they’re looking for a restaurant, they might only check one or two review sites. But if they are going to purchase a new car and the financial stakes are higher, they will probably look at more review sites. When judging a local business on its reviews, which of these factors do you pay most attention to? Note: Respondents were told to select a maximum of two answers. Key findings: 58 percent of consumers put the highest weight on the overall star rating. The second most important factor is “sentiment of reviews.” The recency of reviews is also important, coming in third at 41 percent. When evaluating online reviews, the most important factor to consumers is how many stars a business has. Star ratings are a very quick and visual guide to show how trustworthy a business is. But there are other factors that people consider to get a holistic view of a business’s reputation. Other factors are the sentiment of reviews (i.e., positive or negative comments and statements) and the recency (aka age) of reviews. As an example, if a business has three five-star reviews, but the reviews are two years old, the consumer will probably devalue the importance of the star rating because they really want to see more recent reviews. When selecting a local business to use, what is the minimum star rating a business must have for you to use them? Key findings: 87 percent of people want to see three- to five-star reviews about a business before they will consider using them. Of the consumers surveyed, only 14 percent would consider using a business with a one- or two-star rating. For consumers, star ratings are considered the most important factor in deciding which local business to use. For instance, 56 percent of consumers won’t consider using a business with just one to three stars; in other words, if a business has less than a four-star rating, that company is losing out on 56 percent of potential customers. Notably, while consumers consider star ratings to be an important decision-making factor, they are also realistic — only 8 percent expect a business to have a five-star rating before they will consider using them. How do online customer reviews influence your decision to actually use a local business? Note: Respondents could select more than one answer, so these numbers cannot be directly compared to 2015 results. Key findings: 68 percent of people say positive customer reviews make them more likely to use a local business. 12 percent of consumers say that they read reviews, but those reviews don’t influence their decision on which local business to use. 42 percent say that negative reviews make them not want to use a local business. Almost 70 percent of consumers said that positive reviews make them more likely to use a local business. Additionally, 42 percent of consumers say that negative reviews make them not want to use a business. These numbers show that people seriously consider reviews when making a purchasing decision. Do you trust online customer reviews as much as personal recommendations? Key findings: 83 percent of people trust online reviews as much as a personal recommendation — if they meet their requirements (vs. 80 percent in 2015). Just 16 percent of consumers surveyed said that they don’t trust online reviews (vs. 20 percent in 2015). Authenticity is essential — over a quarter of consumers trust reviews more than personal recommendations only if they believe the review to be genuine. People trust reviews now more than ever, but a portion of consumers are concerned about fake reviews: 27 percent of people will trust reviews if they think they are authentic (31 percent in 2015). If consumers think that a review is “planted” or “seems too good to be true,” they will take that into consideration. Fake reviews, and the effect they have on eroding consumer trust, have become hot topics as of late. As this topic gets more media coverage, consumers become more aware of the pitfalls of online reviews. When you read positive reviews for a business, what is the typical next step you take? Key findings: After reading positive reviews, 54 percent of consumers will visit the business’s website (48 percent in 2015). 19 percent will visit the business directly. 17 percent will search for additional reviews about the business. The most common next step for consumers who read reviews is to visit the business’s website (54 percent). This is an easy next step because people are already online, and there’s typically a link to the business’s website from the review sites. This does reinforce the need for SMBs to have a mobile-friendly website. Only 19 percent say their next step would be to visit a business’s premises. This will vary depending on the type of business a consumer is looking for. For instance, if they’re looking for a restaurant, the numbers will be higher; if they’re searching for a physician or wedding planner — something that might first require an appointment or phone consultation — then it’s unlikely that your next step would be to visit the business. A full 17 percent of consumers say that they would seek out additional reviews about the business they are considering. This indicates a high level of interest in a particular business — if a consumer is continuing to look for reviews, then that means they are probably getting closer to a buying decision. Have you ever been asked by a business to leave an online review for them? Key findings: 70 percent of consumers have been asked by a business to leave a review. 50 percent of consumers have been asked to leave a review about a business and actually left a review. This is important: if asked, approximately 71 percent of consumers will leave a review for a business. This reinforces the need for every business to have a reputation marketing strategy. While this finding does illustrate the importance of asking customers for reviews, businesses must exercise caution and patience in doing so. Why? Too many reviews acquired within a short time frame can look suspicious, meaning those reviews could end up getting flagged and filtered out on the review platform. Ask your customers for reviews gradually over time, and don’t overdo it. Additionally, businesses should never use offers to incentivize consumers to leave reviews (That’s considered unethical). Reviews, positive or negative, serve as a useful feedback tool for businesses. Use this information to improve your customer service or business offerings. Want to learn more?

SUBSCRIBE Common Search: The open source project bringing back PageRank Columnist JR Oakes explains Common Search, a great open source tool for understanding how search engines work, which has a hidden gem for those of us who miss checking our PageRank score. JR Oakes on November 14, 2016 at 9:58 am More Over the last several years, Google has slowly reduced the amount of data available to SEO practitioners. First it was keyword data, then PageRank score. Now it is specific search volume from AdWords (unless you are spending some moola). You can read more about this in Russ Jones’s excellent article that details the impact of his company’s research and insights into clickstream data for volume disambiguation. One item that we have gotten really involved in recently is Common Crawl data. There are several teams in our industry that have been using this data for some time, so I felt a little late to the game. Common Crawl data is an open source project that scrapes the entire internet at regular intervals. Thankfully, Amazon, being the great company it is, pitched in to store the data to make it available to many without the the high storage costs. In addition to Common Crawl data, there is a non-profit called Common Search whose mission is to create an alternative open source and transparent search engine — the opposite, in many respects, of Google. This piqued my interest because it means that we all can play, tweak and mangle the signals to learn how search engines operate without the huge time investment of starting from ground zero. Common Search data Currently, Common Search uses the following data sources for calculating their search rankings (This is taken directly from their website): Common Crawl: The largest open repository of web crawl data. This is currently our unique source of raw page data. Wikidata: A free, linked database that acts as central storage for the structured data of many Wikimedia projects like Wikipedia, Wikivoyage and Wikisource. UT1 Blacklist: Maintained by Fabrice Prigent from the Université Toulouse 1 Capitole, this blacklist categorizes domains and URLs into several categories, including “adult” and “phishing.” DMOZ: Also known as the Open Directory Project, it is the oldest and largest web directory still alive. Though its data is not as reliable as it was in the past, we still use it as a signal and metadata source. Web Data Commons Hyperlink Graphs: Graphs of all hyperlinks from a 2012 Common Crawl archive. We are currently using its Harmonic Centrality file as a temporary ranking signal on domains. We plan to perform our own analysis of the web graph in the near future. Alexa top 1M sites: Alexa ranks websites based on a combined measure of page views and unique site users. It is known to be demographically biased. We are using it as a temporary ranking signal on domains. Common Search ranking In addition to these data sources, in investigating the code, it also uses URL length, path length and domain PageRank as ranking signals in its algorithm. Lo and behold, since July, Common Search has had its own data on host-level PageRank, and we all missed it. I will get to the PageRank (PR) in a moment, but it is interesting to review the code of Common Crawl, especially the ranker.py portion located here, because you really can get into the driver’s seat with tweaking the weights of the signals that it uses to rank the pages: signal_weights = {
"url_total_length": 0.01,
"url_path_length": 0.01,
"url_subdomain": 0.1,
"alexa_top1m": 5,
"wikidata_url": 3,
"dmoz_domain": 1,
"dmoz_url": 1,
"webdatacommons_hc": 1,
"commonsearch_host_pagerank": 1
} Of particular note, as well, is that Common Search uses BM25 as the similarity measure of keyword to document body and meta data. BM25 is a better measure than TF-IDF because it takes document length into account, meaning a 200-word document that has your keyword five times is probably more relevant than a 1,500-word document that has it the same number of times. It is also worthwhile to say that the number of signals here is very rudimentary and obviously missing many of the refinements (and data) that Google has integrated in their search ranking algorithm. One of the key things that we are working on is to use the data available in Common Crawl and the infrastructure of Common Search to do topic vector search for content that is relevant based on semantics, not just keyword matching. On to PageRank On the page here, you can find links to the host-level PageRank for the June 2016 Common Crawl. I am using the one entitled pagerank-top1m.txt.gz (top 1 million) because the other file is 3GB and over 112 million domains. Even in R, I do not have enough machine to load it without capping out. After downloading, you will need to bring the file into your working directory in R. The PageRank data from Common Search is not normalized and also is not in the clean 0-10 format that we are all used to seeing it in. Common Search uses “max(0, min(1, float(rank) / 244660.58))” — basically, a domain’s rank divided by Facebook’s rank — as the method of translating the data into a distribution between 0 and 1. But this leaves some definite gaps, in that this would leave Linkedin’s PageRank as a 1.4 when scaled by 10. The following code will load the dataset and append a PR column with a better approximated PR: #Grab the data
df <- read.csv("pagerank-top1m.txt", header = F, sep = " ")

#Log Normalize
logNorm <- function(x){

    #Normalize
    x <- (x-min(x))/(max(x)-min(x))
    10 / (1 - (log10(x)*.25))
}

#Append a Column named PR to the dataset
df$pr <- (round(logNorm(df$V2),digits = 0))


 We had to play around a bit with the numbers to get it somewhere close (for several samples of domains that I remembered the PR for) to the old Google PR. Below are a few example PageRank results: en.wikipedia.org (8) searchengineland.com (6) consultwebs.com (5) youtube.com (9) moz.com (6) Here is a plot of 100,000 random samples. The calculated PageRank score is along the Y-axis, and the original Common Search score is along the X-axis. To grab your own results, you can run the following command in R (Just substitute your own domain): df[df$V1=="searchengineland.com",c('pr')] Keep in mind that this dataset only has the top one million domains by PageRank, so out of 112 million domains that Common Search indexed, there is a good chance your site may not be there if it doesn’t have a pretty good link profile. Also, this metric includes no indication of the harmfulness of links, only an approximation of your site’s popularity with respect to links. Common Search is a great tool and a great foundation. I am looking forward to getting more involved with the community there and hopefully learning to understand the nuts and bolts behind search engines better by actually working on one. With R and a little code, you can have a quick way to check PR for a million domains in a matter of seconds. Hope you enjoyed!

Barry Schwartz on November 14, 2016 at 9:17 am More Google has updated the How Search Works page to say they now have knowledge of over 130 trillion pages across the web. The page reads, “Search starts with the web. It’s made up of over 130 trillion individual pages and it’s constantly growing.” That figure is up by 100 trillion pages from when Google first launched this web page back in March 1, 2013. In fact, the original blog post from Google shows the metric of pages back then, which was less than four years ago, to be only 30 trillion pages. Here is a screen shot of the original number back on March 1, 2013: Today, less than four years later, that number has grown by 100 trillion pages to read 130 trillion pages: Postscript: This story has been updated to reflect that this number is not based on the pages actually in their index but what Google is aware of across the web.

SUBSCRIBE Google’s advanced verification test in San Diego just dropped over 89% of listings from the 3-pack Columnist and local search expert Joy Hawkins shows the results of a recent Google My Business advanced verification test and explores the new home services local pack. Joy Hawkins on November 14, 2016 at 10:53 am More I have just managed to find my first live example of the next step for the advanced verification beta test for locksmiths and plumbers in San Diego. We knew that these businesses had to pass advanced verification before November 10 or Google was going to be removing their listings. So now that we are past that date, what happened? As you can see, the search results (which only a very small percentage of users are seeing at the moment) show two different types of “3-packs.” The home service 3-pack The first local pack in the search results has a “Sponsored” message on it that says these listings are a part of Google’s Home Service section and links to this article. When I click “More plumbers” on that 3-pack, I get two different types of listings. The top listings appear to be paid, each sporting a “Send Request” button and a “Google guaranteed” badge beside it. The Help Center, however, does not really clarify if these features are paid. At first it seems that this is like the home service ads group, similar to what we’ve been seeing in the Bay Area. What’s not 100 percent clear is if you have to pay to be in this list, or if paying just gets you some type of advantage in the list. When you scroll down in the list, the bottom listings look more like organic listings (They are missing the “Google guaranteed” badge and “Send Request” button). However, they appear to be using tracking phone numbers, which makes me think maybe they could have some type of paid component. Also, when searching the names of a lot of businesses in this list, I found that many were not in San Diego, but rather in the suburbs. This also makes me think that these listings are paid. For example, Louies Plumbing says San Diego on this list, yet their Maps listing shows them in Vista. Sludgebusters Septic Service also says San Diego, but they’re in Ramona. Ideal Plumbing Heating Air Electrical is the only one I could find on both this list and the regular 3-pack. They are in San Diego, and they have a storefront. I spoke to Jim Froling from 949 Local, who has a client (locksmith) who is a part of this group. He originally posted about this on the Local Search Forum. His client is paying for this via AdWords Express, and he was told by Google that you do need to utilize AdWords Express to be in this group and that the listings rotate based on a few factors, including reviews. The organic 3-pack As far as the second 3-pack (the purely organic one), only seven businesses made the cut. These are the businesses that passed Advanced Verification. Another thing I noticed is that literally every single one of them has a storefront. They all have driving direction request buttons as well. In case you’re wondering how many were there before, on November 9, there were about eight pages of results, each page containing 20 listings. The screen shots I was tracking only checked the first three pages of results, so I know there were at least 60 local listings, all using addresses in San Diego on November 9. The pages farther back could possibly have dipped into surrounding cities. So it went from 60+ listings to seven (cutting out more than 89 percent). Any business that didn’t pass advanced verification (I’m sure a lot of spam) or didn’t have a storefront is no longer in this list. Here is a screen shot of who was there November 9. As you can see, only Powers Plumbing made the cut. Something else I noticed that might terrify some people (or make them excited) is that the paid/home services pack is now showing as well for branded searches. That means someone could be searching your business name — and beside your knowledge panel, there is a paid pack of your competitors! I’m waiting for CPCs to skyrocket now in San Diego.

Email Password Remember me Forgot password?     Log in with Facebook Log in with Twitter Log In news tech & science social media business entertainment life sports     Google Play Music now uses AI to guess what you want to listen to Listen | Print By James Walker     yesterday in Technology Google has announced a substantial overhaul of its Google Play Music streaming service. The company has rebuilt the app with a brighter, upbeat design and new features powered by machine learning. 'Personalised music' is now the core focus. Google announced the new version of the app today. It will begin to rollout as an update on Android, iOS and the web in regions worldwide later this week. Google described the new app as a "fresh take" on music streaming that's more intelligent and easier to use. The most noticeable change on opening the app will be the revamped home screen. The new design has been built from the ground-up to suit every user, creating the "ultimate personal DJ." Google uses artificial intelligence to populate the home screen with songs it thinks you'll want to hear. If you open the app while at work, it'll suggest a playlist of songs you frequently listen to while focusing. Alternatively, a set of more inspiring tracks might be played early in the morning. The home screen isn't entirely reliant on AI. It's also honed by dedicated curators to ensure there's always fresh content available in the app. The AI is there to augment the experience, making it more personal, relatable and applicable to individual users. Human input will be present in all the recommendations made by the service. Google has used the same context-aware tools that feature in its other apps to build Play Music. Because its AI already knows most users, it can begin to deliver personalised music suggestions as soon as the app is opened. The machine learning functionality is entirely optional and will be enabled on an opt-in basis. Google is anticipating that most users will benefit from the convenience it offers. "When you opt in, we'll deliver personalized music based on where you are and why you are listening – relaxing at home, powering through at work, commuting, flying, exploring new cities, heading out on the town and everything in between," said Google. "Your workout music is front and center as you walk into the gym, a sunset soundtrack appears just as the sky goes pink, and tunes for focusing turn up at the library." The new Play Music also comes with features that help to make it more accessible. While it's a streaming service at heart, Google recognises that not everyone can find a reliable internet connection during the day. To accommodate these offline scenarios, Play Music will automatically cache your favourite tracks and keep them available when the Internet isn't. Once you've subscribed to the feature, a playlist of the songs you've listened to most recently will be generated. This will be automatically updated and stored for offline playback, keeping music available wherever you are. It avoids the disappointment of forgetting to download a new album or relying on an unstable mobile network. The new app will begin to rollout across supported platforms in the coming days. It will be available in 62 countries worldwide with full support for the context-aware machine learning within. The app represents Google's growing ambitions in artificial intelligence, aiming to include the technology in all its products. In Play Music, it will be tasked with increasing convenience and reducing the gap between opening the app and starting playback. "From parks to airports to bars, whether you're walking, biking, or driving, the right music makes any moment better," said Google. "With the new Google Play Music, we're here to help with the perfect soundtrack for the things you do every day. After all, the only thing better than finding the perfect music is the perfect music finding you."

In emerging markets the growth of mobile LBS is being boosted by a growing penetration of GPS on lower priced handset tiers. Furthermore, for the third year running, location platform HERE has come top in Strategy Analytics' location platform benchmark study, and is placed well for future growth opportunities as the mobile location services market continues to evolve. Click here for the report:  http://sa-link.cc/MobileLBS Photo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161114/438754 Rising adoption of smartphone-centric mobility apps, including Uber, Lyft, and Didi, among others, and the meteoric rise of the location-based augmented reality game, Pokémon Go, have provided a welcome boost to the mobile LBS sector during 2016. Nitesh Patel, Director, Strategy Analytics noted "Mobile location services are benefitting from the shift in demand for urban transport towards on-demand, mobile-centric services, where the smartphone plays an increasingly important role for both journey planning and the administration of these services. Ride-hailing and car-sharing will be further boosted by their integration into major mobile journey planning applications, such as Apple Maps, Google Maps and HERE WeGo, which are evolving into one-stop-shops for journey planning and support."   The report assesses the strengths and weaknesses of global LBS players, Apple, Google, HERE, and TomTom, across eight important metrics, including map and navigation coverage, indoor venue capabilities, reach across major mobile device platforms, map data visualization, in-vehicle connectivity, offline usage, local search and crowd sourcing. The race to provide the most fresh, up-to-date and accurate maps in real-time is being driven by a combination of the trend towards autonomous driving, and greater consumer dependence on smartphones for journey planning and execution in outdoor, and increasingly indoor environments. David Kerr, Senior Vice President at Strategy Analytics, noted "For the third year in the row HERE has maintained its leadership in mapping and location capabilities, followed by Google, TomTom and then Apple. HERE's ownership by car-makers enables it to leverage its strength in the automotive industry across all digital platforms, including mobile. Google maintains its leadership in business –to-consumer (B2C) LBS applications, as it benefits from preloading on most Android handsets, and is the most widely used map, navigation and local search app. Both Apple and TomTom remain in catch-up mode with TomTom aiming to improve its support of multi-modal routing and navigation, including ramping its coverage of indoor venues in 2017."

N E X T Email Print Save Text:  A A Tips for Onsite Content Optimization With a Human Touch by Nyima Bieber  |   November 14, 2016  |  994 views Tweet Kindle Email Top What drives your website content strategy? It's simple enough to set up a site based on what you think it should be about and how it should look, but optimizing it for SEO is a whole different ballgame. Why Optimize Your Website Content for SEO? Put simply, by optimizing the very signals that communicate your website's purpose, you send Google a clear message of what your site is all about. Though Google and other search engines can be surprisingly accurate, search engine crawlers don't evaluate your site in the same way that a human does, so optimization is also about including the correct coding and keywords: focusing on the meta title, creating a good description that invites people to your site, adding headers that make sense, and writing content that accurately describes what it is you do. In aggregate, those small modifications can improve not only the site's performance in organic search results but also the user experience. All that's on the surface. But, really, even basic onsite content optimization involves much more. Keyword Research We know that keyword research is important to determine what people are searching for that could potentially lead them to your website. Creating a good list is essential. You will refer to that list (editing it over time) to know how to best optimize each section of your site. Keyword research isn't rocket science, but you do need to get it right. Aside from Google Analytics, tools like SEMRush can be helpful to see which terms generate traffic and which ones are generating buzz in your industry. It's a chance to brainstorm, pop in words, and see what makes sense in the online world. You'll also develop an understanding of how people search for you or your product—which words and phrases resonate with them. There are various scientific ways to carry out keyword research, but the basic premise is this: Make a list of relevant keywords and record the search volume for each one. You can then narrow down your list, and, finally, using your good judgment, assign one or two keywords to each category on your website. Also, check out your competitors. If a competitor is ranking for a certain keyword you'd like to go after, determine whether their onsite content is helping their cause. You can check the page source to see what they are using for their meta titles and H (header) tags, but even just a quick hover over their meta titles can show you what they are targeting on each page, and whether they are optimizing their page content strategically. Writing for Humans Google recommends writing and basing "your optimization decisions first and foremost on what's best for the visitors of your site." This is a kind of a buffer, if you will, a free pass to step away from the cold hard statistical analysis and ensure your website always looks visitor-friendly. It also means no keyword-stuffing or taking the easy way out (see below for more on avoiding over-optimization). Your meta titles should be written for humans to read—making them easy for the eye to take in and easy for a person to understand. The H1s and H2s on the page should make sense, as they are the titles and subtitles within the content. They are not places to simply fill up with keywords or pop in a search engine-relevant phrase just because it has a high search volume. Think of meta titles that not only contain a keyword and tell shoppers what they are looking for but also address their intent. "Modern Mirrors to Brighten Up Your Home—Shop Now." That meta title will be more effective, and less spammy than an antiquated title that's simply a list of keywords, like this one: "Modern Mirrors | Square Mirrors | Round Mirrors." There's an Art to It Writing optimized content takes a light and thoughtful touch. You have to find a balance between writing for your audience and adding strategic keywords here and there. Doing so involves analysis and common sense. When going through the meta tags and page content for the various pages, ask yourself over and over: Does that make sense? Does the keyword belong there, or am I going out of my way to put it in there? Does this accurately describe, in an artful way, what my page or site is about? For the content modules on each page: Do they give the reader the information they need? Also, is the information clear and concise? Finally, is the content correct? Now is the time to edit and correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation issues. Your website needs to instill trust in the reader, and mistakes simply have no place on a professional website. Go on, get help, have the best grammar expert on your team go through the content with a fine-tooth comb. Avoiding Over-Optimization In the interest of driving as much traffic as possible to a website, many eager site owners will add as many keywords as possible to a certain page. It's hard to avoid—you may have just one page and one shot—to use two or three or four relevant keywords, and you want to make their presence known. Or you may be writing naturally, and, without meaning to, there are those keywords listed over and over again. Tip: After writing a paragraph, highlight your keywords in red. If they are listed numerous times, consider paring them down until they are present but not overbearing—two or three keyword mentions within a piece of text is a good guide. Over-optimization may simply result in a spammy-looking page, but even more dangerous than that is that you could be affected by a Google Panda Update. Introduced in 2011, it is used by the search giant to keep sites with poor quality, or over-optimized, content from gaining traction in the search results. Character Limits and Content: A Simple Checklist Though Google recently introduced some leeway for the character count of meta titles and descriptions, the results are yet to be seen across all search terms; Google admits it is always trying and testing, so it's best to stay on the safe side: Meta titles: 50-60 characters Meta descriptions: 150-160 characters Keywords in content: 2-3 mentions on each page. With all that in mind, it's time to optimize your website! Use these necessary website elements to your advantage in SEO.

Featured Story: How to Root Android: Our Always-Updated Rooting Guide for Any Phone or Tablet Android Gadget Hacks: Unchaining Android to enable tomorrow's features today — WonderHowTo How To: Google Actually Has 4 Different 'Assistants'—Here's the Best One for You Dallas Thomas 20 hours ago Google Actually Has 4 Different 'Assistants'—Here's the Best One for You The new Google Assistant is only officially available on three platforms—Google's Pixel phones, the Google Allo app, and Google Home. However, most of the Assistant's basic functionality is also bundled into the Google app for Android and iOS, which used to go by the name Google Now, but is now referred to only as Screen Search or your Google app's Feed. Counting the three official Google Assistant platforms and the Google app for Android and iOS, we now have a total of four different ways to interact with Google conversationally. Then, when you consider that all four of these "Assistants" have their own strengths and weaknesses, things start to get a little confusing. So to clarify, we reached out to Google's PR team and got a few answers, and we'll share those below while also explaining how Google Assistant works on each platform. Don't Miss: 10 Things Google Assistant Can Do to Make Your Life Easier The Four Googles Before we get into all of the finer differences between the various ways to interact with Google, let's take a second to define them all. Google Pixel's Assistant: The voice-based Google Assistant that is currently only available on the Google Pixel and Pixel XL. Google Home's Assistant: Another voice-based variant of the Google Assistant, which is only available if you purchase a Google Home smart speaker. Google Allo's Assistant: A text-based form of the Google Assistant that you can access by installing the Google Allo app for Android or iOS. Google app: What used to be called Google Now and Now on Tap. Instead, these features are now called Feed and Screen Search, respectively, and they're both included with the regular Google app for Android or iOS. The Google app's Feed shows you cards with relevant info before you perform a search, and the Screen Search feature lets you perform a quick Google search for keywords on the screen you're viewing (Android only). Pixel's Assistant First up, let's talk about the Pixel's version of the Google Assistant. This one's probably the most confusing, because you've got voice-based interactions and text-based interactions right on the same home screen, which would lead you to believe that these are different ways to interact with the Assistant. But as the Google spokesperson we contacted put it, "There is only one Google Assistant." You see, the Google Assistant is only one part of the overall Google experience on the Pixel: When you long-press your home button, you can speak to the Google Assistant from any screen. That's it. Short of installing Google Allo (more on that later), this is the only way to access Google Assistant on the Pixel. The rest of the Pixel's Google features are all parts of the regular Google app. There's a widget on your home screen where you can type searches or dictate voice queries, but that offers the same experience you would get on any phone by installing the Google app. Don't Miss: How to Get Rid of Google Assistant on Your Pixel & Switch Back to Google Now There's a page on the left of your home screen that displays your Feed, showing you relevant information before you perform a search—but again, this is just an extension of the Google app. Makes sense, right? But there's one more wrinkle we need to address: The Google Assistant on the Pixel has a slightly different set of features than the Google Assistant on other platforms. You can ask the Pixel's Assistant to send a message to one of your contacts, but this isn't possible with the Assistant on Google Home. Same goes for "Show me pictures of [x]." And unlike the other platforms, the Pixel's Assistant has Screen Search baked in, meaning you can scan your current screen for search keywords by swiping up after triggering the Assistant—but this is only possible because of the Google app integration on the Pixel. To address these discrepancies, the Google spokesperson told us, "The goal of the Assistant is to provide the best results for the context in which you're interacting, so depending on the surface, you may get a slightly different result." Fair enough, but there are still some other minor differences between the various versions of Google and the Google Assistant. Verdict: Use the Pixel's Assistant if you want to go hands-free. The extra on-device features compared to Google Home give it the edge in voice command capabilities for now. Allo's Assistant Another way to access the Google Assistant is by installing the Google Allo app for Android or iOS. It's a messaging service similar to WhatsApp, but with one neat trick up its sleeve—you can message the Google Assistant directly, as if it were one of your contacts. For the most part, Allo's Assistant behaves almost exactly like the Google Assistant on Pixel devices, except it's text-based rather than voice-based. Another difference is that there's no Google app integration, so when you're using Allo, you're only interacting with Google Assistant. This means there's no Screen Search or Feed, but it's an understandable omission, as the Google app can be downloaded separately if you want these features. Don't Miss: Google's New AI-Powered Allo App Makes Your Messages Smarter However, there are some things that Allo's Assistant can do which other Assistant platforms cannot. For instance, "Show me pictures of [x]" still works, even though it's not currently possible on Google Home. In addition to that, you can play an emoji-based guessing game with the Assistant on Allo, but this isn't an option on any of the other platforms. So we're starting to notice a trend here: The Google Assistant can have slightly different capabilities depending on how you access it. To expand on that concept, the Google spokesperson told us: An emoji game in Allo wouldn't work on the Assistant on Pixel because Pixel is voice-only, while Allo gives you the opportunity to type emoji responses. It's still very early days and by no means is the Assistant perfect on day 1, but our goal is to provide the more relevant result for your question. — Google Spokesperson Think of it this way: The Pixel has a Google search widget on the home screen that you can type queries into, so there's no need for its Assistant to accept text input. However, with Allo, the whole point of the app is texting, so the Assistant only exists in a text-based form, which gives it a different set of strengths on this platform. Verdict: Use Allo's Assistant if you don't like talking to your phone. As it stands, Allo is the only platform where you can actually type to Google Assistant. Google Home's Assistant To summarize what we've learned so far, you talk to the Pixel's Assistant, and write to Allo's Assistant, which gives you a slightly different experience on the two different platforms. But what about the Assistant that's baked into the new Google Home smart speaker? Much like the Pixel's Assistant, this one can only be spoken to because there's no keyboard. But there's another hardware limitation that leads to a few more minor discrepancies—the Google Home doesn't have a display. For this reason, Google Home's Assistant doesn't know what to do when you ask it things like "Show me pictures of cats." But on the bright side, it also means that the Assistant in Google Home gets Google Cast capabilities. Don't Miss: 20 Google Home Easter Eggs & Fun Commands When you're setting up Google Home, you can add any Google Cast-compatible devices to your Assistant's repertoire, which includes Chromecast and Android TV. Once you've done that, you can ask the Assistant to "Show me cat videos on my TV," then the media will pop up on the external display. Sadly, this functionality is not available with Assistant in Allo or on the Pixel. But on the bright side, we asked Google about this issue, and it's one discrepancy that should actually get ironed out soon: We're working on bringing Cast functionality to the Assistant on Pixel soon. — Google Spokesperson Verdict: Use Google Home's Assistant if you're into controlling your TV, lights, and other home automation equipment. For now, it still has the edge on Pixel's Assistant when it comes to controlling external devices. The Google App Finally, there's the regular old Google app, which is available for any smartphone, and supports both text and voice input simultaneously. It's what we used to call "Google Now," though its new name is simply "Google," with the additional Now features getting new labels: Google Now is no longer a product. ... [It] continues to live in Screen Search and the Google app on older Android devices. — Google Spokesperson Not mentioned there is the Google Feed, which is the list of cards underneath the search box in the Google app. Together, Google, Screen Search, and Feed make up a pretty formidable Google experience—but unfortunately, the actual Google Assistant feature is going to remain exclusive to Google Home, Allo, and Pixel devices for the foreseeable future: We're starting with Pixel, we have no additional plans to share. — Google Spokesperson You'd think you were missing out by not having access to the new Assistant on non-Pixel smartphones, but this is not necessarily the case. Several features, such as the Shazaam-like "What song is this?" voice command, the ability to share screenshots with Screen Search, and translating on-screen text are not currently available on any of the Google Assistant platforms. In fact, if you're not interested in Google Assistant's conversational attitude on the Pixel, its text-based games in Allo, or the burgeoning smart home control features in Google Home, the regular Google app experience is superior in every other regard. It takes voice and text input as one and the same, has many features that have not yet been ported to Assistant, and offers a consistent experience across all platforms. Verdict: Use the Google app if you like to speak and type to your virtual assistant, or if you prefer extra features. For the time being, the Google app's voice and text controls offer more functionality than any of the official Google Assistant platforms.

By Ken Walker, Senior Vice President & General Counsel, Google. In 2007, we launched Android, a free and open-source operating system. Smartphones back then were an expensive rarity. We wanted to change that — to stimulate innovation and increase choice for consumers — and it worked. Android means manufacturers don’t have to buy or build expensive mobile operating systems. As a result, smartphones are now available at dramatically lower prices — as little as 45 euros — and have become much more accessible to many more people. Today, more than 24,000 devices from over 1,300 brands run on Android. And European developers are able to distribute their apps to over a billion people around the world. Android is not a ‘one way street’; it’s a multi-lane highway of choice. Last April, the European Commission issued a Statement of Objections raising concerns over how we manage Android compatibility and distribute our own apps. The response we filed today shows how the Android ecosystem carefully balances the interests of users, developers, hardware makers, and mobile network operators. Android hasn’t hurt competition, it’s expanded it. First, the Commission’s case is based on the idea that Android doesn’t compete with Apple’s iOS. We don’t see it that way.  We don’t think Apple does either. Or phone makers. Or developers. Or users. In fact, 89% of respondents to the Commission’s own market survey confirmed that Android and Apple compete. To ignore competition with Apple is to miss the defining feature of today’s competitive smartphone landscape. Second, we are concerned that the Commission’s preliminary findings underestimate the importance of developers and the dangers of fragmentation in a mobile ecosystem.  Developers — and there were at least 1.3 million of them in Europe in 2015 — depend on a stable and consistent framework to do their work.  Any phone maker can download Android and modify it in any way they choose. But that flexibility makes Android vulnerable to fragmentation, a problem that plagued previous operating systems like Unix and Symbian. When anyone can modify your code, how do you ensure there’s a common, consistent version of the operating system, so that developers don’t have to go through the hassle and expense of building multiple versions of their apps? To manage this challenge, we work with hardware makers to establish a minimum level of compatibility among Android devices.  Critically, we give phone makers wide latitude to build devices that go above that baseline, which is why you see such a varied universe of Android devices. That’s the key: our voluntary compatibility agreements enable variety while giving developers confidence to create apps that run seamlessly across thousands of different phones and tablets. This balance stimulates competition between Android devices as well as between Android and Apple’s iPhone. Android’s compatibility rules help minimize fragmentation and sustain a healthy ecosystem for developers. Ninety-four percent of respondents who answered questions on fragmentation in a Commission market survey said that it harms the Android platform. Developers worry about it, and our competitors with proprietary platforms (who don’t face the same risk) regularly criticize us for it.  The Commission’s proposal risks making fragmentation worse, hurting the Android platform and mobile phone competition. Third, the Commission argues that we shouldn’t offer some Google apps as part of a suite. No manufacturer is obliged to preload any Google apps on an Android phone. But we do offer manufacturers a suite of apps so that when you buy a new phone you can access a familiar set of basic services. Android’s competitors, including Apple’s iPhone and Microsoft’s Windows phone, not only do the same, but they allow much less choice in the apps that come with their phones. On Android, Google’s apps typically account for less than one-third of the preloaded apps on the device (and only a small fraction of device memory). A consumer can swipe away any of our apps at any time. And, uniquely, hardware makers and carriers can pre-install rival apps right next to ours. In competition-speak, that means there’s no “foreclosure”.      There’s also plenty of evidence that consumers can easily choose which apps they want — something the Commission has recognized in other investigations. The average Android user in Europe downloads an additional 50 apps over the lifetime of their device. Downloading and replacing an app or widget is simple — you can do it in thirty seconds. Users downloaded 65 billion apps from Google Play in 2015 — an average of more than 175 million apps a day. Since 2011, apps offering similar functionality to those in our suite have been downloaded almost 15 billion times. Again, there’s no evidence of foreclosure. Many pre-installed apps don’t succeed, and many have been extremely successful through user downloads — think of Spotify or Snapchat. Our apps suite approach explicitly preserves users’ freedom to choose the apps they want on their phones. Finally, distributing products like Google Search together with Google Play permits us to offer our entire suite for free — as opposed to, for example, charging upfront licensing fees. This free distribution is an efficient solution for everyone — it lowers prices for phone makers and consumers, while still letting us sustain our substantial investment in Android and Play. Today’s mobile devices show all the signs of fierce competition with a wide range of business models: from vertically integrated ones like Apple’s iOS to open-source systems like Android. The rapid innovation, wide choice, and falling prices we see in smartphones represent the hallmarks of robust competition. Android has unleashed a new generation of innovation and inter-platform competition. By any measure, it is the most open, flexible, and differentiated of the mobile computing platforms. But open-source platforms are fragile. They survive and grow by balancing the needs of all participants, including users and developers. The Commission’s approach would upset this balance, and send an unintended signal favouring closed over open platforms.  It would mean less innovation, less choice, less competition, and higher prices. That wouldn’t be just a bad outcome for us. It would be a bad outcome for developers, for phone makers and carriers, and, most critically, for consumers. That’s the case we are making to the Commission in our filing today. We look forward to continuing the dialogue.
